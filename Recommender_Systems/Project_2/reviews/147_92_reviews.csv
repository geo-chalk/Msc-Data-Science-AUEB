147,92,tyden46,3.75,"Quite bitter, but that's to be expected, I suppose. There is some balance with a nice maltiness but not enough balance for me, I would prefer more malt flavor. Fortunately for me the hops aren't too dank or piney (which I don't enjoy) - just a little bitter grapefruit.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Dr_Gonzo,4.25,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Appearance is a mahogany color with a thick foamy beige head. Good retention and lacing.  Aroma: dark fruit, caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, roasted nuts.  Taste: just like the aroma and very crisp and bitter, which is a nice change from the typical lower IBU beers that I've had. Other notes of grapefruit, toffee, and maybe even coffee. Body is medium-light.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,StickmasterFlex,3.27,"Compared to the original Arrogant Bastard, this is a poor sequel. The original had a strong malt backbone to balance the bitterness. This incarnation has no malt to speak of. It's just another beer substituting IBUs for flavor.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,LucidoMMA,4.14,Pours a dark amber color with two finger darkened head that is very retentive in the middle and not so much on the sides.  Smells of very earthy hops.  Immediate bite some roasted notes in it. Lots of very roasted flavors.  Overall bitter hops and roasted malts dominate The taste with a nice bitter finish.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Sandys_Shack,2.86,"Sorry but I can't help it... this is for me ... so common... so ""basic"" I cannot give an enthusiast rating. I feel the alcool overpush, I don't understand the flavor progression. For me this beer is disorganised.  But Again... I must confess... I am not into the ""strong"" beer at all cost... I am about the feel... if you surprise me with a extra strong beer and I don't notice it... Yeah.... I can be in our religion... otherwise... nop ... sorry ...

147,92,MadMadMike,4.18,"12 oz can poured to a pint glass. Rich foam sticks and laces. Smells musty, lil dank, hoppy, a sweet thing lurks. Taste isn’t like a common beer of genre, it’s rather refined - you like it you like it, you don’t.,. well, I do. Feel is mid. Carb is fine. Overall, I like an Arrogant Bastard when I can get my hands on one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,LunchMoney,4.2,Picked up a bottle then realized it is a few months past the enjoy by date. I’m not sure how much that affected it. Great strong ale. Reminds of some of the Belgians I’ve had. But the IBU’s on this one are too much. The bitterness kind of overwhelms the flavor.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BillAfromSoCal,3.94,"dark amber, somewhat loose 1 finger head receding to very little. A bit of lacing. Smell is more malt than the taste.

147,92,nizzle8287,5,"This beer is so good! This was one of the first brews that has extreme levels of hop IBUs that I ever tried, long ago... Look: Expansive light-khaki colored head that extends a finger above the rim of my snifter, and leaves so much lacing, all atop a cloudy, deep crimson body. Smell is a bit of citrus on top of dark fruit, on top of a hop factory, with caramel drizzled on top of all of that. Taste is relentlessly hoppy, leaving hop resin in the mouth so very thick, leaving an extremely bitter aftertaste, that in my opinion, is quite pleasing. I'd be lying if I said this tasted like anything but a hop hurricane in the mouth. Mouth feel is actually very smooth for being such an abrasively hoppy brew. Carbonation is above average, but it makes this hop tornado so sparkling and delicious. ABV is all there, but I don't know of many people who drink strong ale that shy away from a little booziness. Overall a fantastically hoppy brew. LOVE it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,JZH1000,4.09,"Older bottle just over a year but hopefully the darker color and abv helped it age. 22oz bomber.  On the pour a fine 1 finger head forms that slowly recedes to a very light covering and a ring around the glass. Light haze, and very dark, a murky reddish brown that lest some but not a lot of light through. Light lazy carbonation, no lacing.  Aroma is very nice despite the age. Some traditional west coast IPA notes and some nice floral aromas on top of an earthy chocolate caramel malt note. Some umami and a slight dryness on the finish presumably from the age, but it all ties together quite nicely.  Flavor follows the aroma pretty closely and introduces some fig and date dark fruit flavors followed by a stouty and hoppy bitterness. Still quite drinkable and smooth despite the bitterness nice and complex, lots of flavor but surprisingly balanced. And not as aggressive as the bottle makes it out to be, but perhaps that's just modern tastes talking.  Feel is quite big and chewy. The abv makes itself known relatively quickly too even when paired with food, and let me tell you 22ozs of 7.2abv will get you there, so don't be an arrogant bastard. Also quite filling.  Overall a beer that's big in every way, hoppy malty, mouthfeel, and abv, but without being completely overwhelming or gimmicky, although a small bit of both. It's a good beer for those who want big malts and big hops.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,whitro17,4.84,I love this beer! So different from all the others. A nice hit of malts & hops with an incredible bitterness that really lingers.

147,92,MagicJeff,4.22,"Look: Dark bronze/sapphire body with a head that reminds me of a latte. Lacing throughout.  Smell: Raisin bread. slight candied orange notes. Slight grapefruit. Citrus and baking spice if I had to sum it up. Complex indeed.  Taste: Orange zest, intense pine. Some fresh dark bread notes. Slight raisin, slightest black pepper alcohol burn on the finish.  Feel: Creamy body. Quite drinkable for a +7 % ABV. I can't imagine trying this beer on Nitro, I think it'd take it to the next level.  Overall: This is one of the gateway beers that got me into craft beer. Distinctly remember it being the early 2010's and becoming burned out on the typical West Coast IPA (ironic because it's come full circle and that's my favorite style yet again) and wanting to try something different. Then and now Bastard has been a refreshing look on a style I'd otherwise not consider. Just a really well-made beer. Probably not your every day brew, but this was a great ""random"" beer to have today.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BigGinge,4.3,"Appearance: Pours a clear ruby color with a nice cap of light khaki colored foam.  Smell: Sweet, toasty, floral and slightly medicinal. Islay Scotch barrel aged Robitussin with a massive dose of hops.  Taste: Sharp and bitter hops up front. Malt contributes a bit of sweetness at the get-go but quickly shifts to a drier and heavily toasted taste. It's difficult for me to pick out any one flavor in particular. It's a complex beer but it's also a barrage on the senses. Rye comes to mind as does charred toast, peat, bitter tylenol-like hops and some oak. Heavily bitter all the way through.  Feel: Medium bodied, sharp carbonation, dry.  Overall: Not an easy drinking beer, but I didn't expect it to be anyway. I can totally understand how some people might not like it, but I've been a fan for close to 10 years now. When I want something to light up my palate I go for one of these. Well worth the money.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Almost peppery. A little fruit in there if you squint your nose some. T: Follows the nose, huge roasted malt character. Doesn't leave room for much else tbh, but a very tiny amount of sweetness sneaks in the middle before the hop bitterness and spice washes it away. F: Arrogant O: This beer is still in a class by itself, even now. I appreciate it but I don't know that I need to revisit it.

147,92,dkoehler42,3.88,"I found this in the fridge and couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed it. It pours a dark brownish ruby color with an off-white head. The nose is primarily malt with a bitter hop aroma. The taste is almost identical, with the heavy grain flavor up front and ending with the hoppy bitterness.

147,92,gvickery,4.29,"Dark reddish copper, clear, off-white head. Smells like toasted raisin bread, on the subtle side. Theres some light citrus notes as well. There’s an initial taste of caramel malts and biscuit immediately followed by a freight train of intense hop bitterness. You can vaguely taste some slight pine/citrus/spice from the hops but it’s mostly just early addition bittering hops that almost make it seem “hot”. No doubt about it, the labels right, if you’re a casual beer drinker or someone who is not very schooled in beer styles you will definitely not like this.

147,92,Barnettaidan81,2.99,"Honestly, they were partially right with that label description. I hated it. Not because my palate isn’t refined enough, but because honestly this just wasn’t good. Definitely arrogant. Really bitter, but the bitterness isn’t leading you to anything, it’s just there. It’s very piney in my opinion and if the bitterness leads you anywhere, thats it. Pine cones and juniper bushes. Honestly just kind of nasty. I won’t be getting it again, and I’m surprised at how many people actually like this. I don’t really waste beer ever, if I open it I drink it all and give it a fair shot, but this one went down the sink about half way through.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The beer has plenty of malt taste (that abv is a good hint) without much sweetness -- and just enough hop bitterness for my tastes. I found it to be kind of like a balanced IPA.

Clear deep reddish mahogany pour with two fingers of creamy/frothy tawny coloured head. Malty nose - caramel , toffee, notes of citrus hop, piney; slightly floral. Yeah - that's the stuff - sweet caramel, toffee malt that is obliterated by sticky resinous hop bitters - grapefruit peel, pine, orange rind; earthy. Medium mouthfeel with decent but not overbearing carbonation - lingering and building bitterness washes over the palate. This remains a trailblazing beer that may not be for every day consumption, but every time I come back to it I love it and love how at first I did not.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,KT3418,3.72,"Im sure when this came out it was edgy and cool but the soliloquy on the bottle is nauseating in the modern day. Anyways, I get a little malt, aggressively bitter hops as advertised, also idk how 7.2 makes this a strong anything but that's besides the point. Bottom line for me is this just doesn't taste very good at all. I feel like its one of those beers people drink to get faded and not cuz it tastes good, it is getting a little easier to drink as i get through it, maybe it'll grow on me.

147,92,JohnniEMc,4.25,"Into a clear glass Imperial pint mug it goes, the contents of a pint can. The process is almost like pouring Coca-Cola. With a dark caramel color and a light biege head that forms quickly. The significant difference is that the head endures. Far from being arrogant, the aroma is subdued, probably a little malty and even less hoppy. Boy, does the taste make up for what the nose doesn't get. Initially malty sweet, with some earthiness, much like black strap molasses, but not as sweet. Then, midstream, biting bitter hops overwhelm the taste buds the way an excellent West Coast IPA would. Probably earthy as contrasted with the resinous and/or piney WCIPAs, the finish is just as bitterly dry and lingering.

Nice but surprisingly moderate aroma of floral and fruity hops. ""Arrogance"" shows its face in the flavour, with a distinct and aggressive hoppy bitterness from start to finish. There is a certain malty sweetness in the background, but I cannot say the Arrogant Bastard belongs in the ""well balanced"" category. It is probably not meant to belong there.

147,92,izraelc,4.25,I first had this almost 20 years ago. Back then it was considered a pretty extreme beer. Now not so much. This beer was definitely ahead of it's time. It really opened your eyes to the possibilities of what beer could be. Pours a dark amber. Big malt aroma. Big bitter hop body. Very aggressive. Slight maltiness with a bitter finish.

It has a nutty character to the nose. The flavor is muted at first with that roasty nuttiness; earthy. It gives way to a very spicy, phenolic finish that really sticks around. In that finish there is a a distinct alcohol flavor. The body is mouth coating but also loose. carbonation is there but not too notable. The alcohol is warming on the way down.

147,92,defunksta,3.93,"Appearance: Pours a darkened ruby, browned color with a large yellow-tinged off-white head. SRM of 18-20. (4.25)  Aroma: The aromas develop as it warms. Strong, deep, and sweet aromas. There's huge resinous flavors of burnt caramel, tobacco, molasses, citrus mandarin orange. Mostly orange citrus, molasses, cocoa. Deep and sweet. (3.75)  Flavor: Flavor develops as it warms. First, strong and smoky flavors of burnt caramel, pine, boiled molasses. Deep, dark, and burnt resin. Moderately better and sweet. I get some sappy tangerine, pineapple, peach nectar. Some burnt molasses and caramel mixed with warmed and toasted pine needles. Lots of alcohol for sure. Combines to form somewhat of a leather flavor. Then a large, flavorless, soapy pine bitterness on the finish that lingers. A terrorizing bitterness here. (4.00)  Feel: Extremely heavier-bodied as expected. Moderate carbonation. Huge lingering soapy, burnt, and indistinct bitterness on the palate. (4.25)  Compared w/ Sierra Nevada's Celebration Fresh Hop IPA 2020: This one pours a darker color. Nearly identical beers. Faint aromas on both, less pine here. Less flavor here. It's heavier and more resinous. A stronger bitterness, but less pine flavor. 2021: Again pours a darker color. More smokey and burnt caramel, molasses, pine, leather, and tobacco.  Compared to Surly's Damien Child of Darkness 5/17/20: Pours a lighter amber-ish color with a much stronger head. Stronger citrus soap and pine. Less roasted black malt. Much stronger bitterness, body, and alcohol sweetness.  Compared to Stone's Subliminely Self-Righteous Black IPA 4/25/21: Pours a lighter, more bronze color. Stronger burnt caramel, pine, and bitterness. Less chocolate, citrus, and pine flavor. Heavier, maltier, but also a stronger bitterness.  Overall: An interesting beer. Deep, dark and complex. Deep and dark flavors of burnt caramel, burnt tobacco, burnt molasses, burnt pine needles. Sappy and resinous. It rounds out and provides a puzzling leather flavor. Suppose maybe tastes like a sweet cigar. The flavors are complex though, and you'll notice many of the reviews don't mention specific flavors. Then a giant wave of bitterness courtesy of Stone. Sort of a mix between Stone IPA and a scotch ale. This beer is abrasive. (Final Rating: 3.93) *Compare next to *",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

It somewhat mortifies me that I've never reviewed this beer. This was once a go-to for me.  Anyway, pours a rich caramel color, fairly clear, with a big head that fades fairly slowly and a healthy amount of carbonation to support it. Smell is vaguely hoppy, a little toffee, some pine sniffing straight from the can. Overall, fairly muted.  Taste is slight toffee sweetness just for a bit before a burnt caramel and slight dark roast coffee wave bowls me over. Bitterness builds up in west-coast IPA style. Coats the mouth in bitterness, with that toffee and burnt caramel drifting around the palate keeping things interesting.  Mouthfeel is medium or a little thicker. Overall, this beer is a classic.

Light carbonation streams visible.  Smell- Sweet malt, caramel, grapefruit peel, coffee and raisins, toasted nuts and grassy/herbal hop notes.  Taste- Similar to the aroma. Sweet malt and caramel, coffee, raisins and toasted nuttiness followed by grapefruit rind and a very intense herbal hop bitterness.  Feel- Heavier side of medium bodied, sticky and fairly dry.

Some fruity esters move in and out of frame before a huge hop bite along with some alcohol close things out Mouthfeel: Medium-high carbonation, slick and thick mouthfeel – viscous but not over the top. Very dry on the finish Overall: Damn this beer is awesome and still a huge, palate-wrecking, and tasty concoction. This is the beer that got me into ‘microbrew’ (read: craft beer) 15 years go and also taught me not to be afraid to challenge the palate.

Very strong smell of British hops mixed with some fine malt aroma. Definite fruit but not as much of the dried variety as in a classic British ESB/barleywine/strong ale. Now I get some chocolate as well, so probably a bit of black malt for colour and just a bit of aroma.  Taste is wonderfully bitter mixed with a ground of sweet pale malt, probably some slightly darker variety too, with a bit of toffee. A ton of hop flavour. Wonderfully chewy and would be interesting to age this. Long aftertaste of hop and malt. Alcohol is well hidden.

147,92,Mekz91,3.82,"Strong crisp taste with a lot of bite. Honestly cant really taste the alcohol that much in here but they must use some secret spices because it gives you a small kick of that throat burn like a shot of liquor, though that feeling is very toned down and I believe they made it this way on purpose.  I'm not sophisticated enough to smell anything special here and I can only compare the overall experience to drinking a 9%ish IPA though the feel here is a bit thinner. It's hard to find the right way to say it but, this is a slightly above average ABV% beer yet, it's purposefully manufactured to taste stronger than it really is. This entire drink is just a prank, though a good one.  I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these at a time.

Good looking pour into a Pine Island Brewery pint glass, a quarter inch of head on top of a nice mahoghany body. Nice.  Very unique nose on this beer. Spicy. I remember this one well but find it difficult to describe. I'm fairly certain I'm going to get a hop-bomb here but it's also extremely yeasty. Odd but nothing unpleasant or scary.  Not a great tasting beer. I would almost believe I was drinking an extremely watered-down barleywine on the front palate, but the hops explode mid and back palate to the degree that it becomes a chore to drink. I believe this may be as bitter as the old Ruination, but in a less pleasant way because Ruination was more a one-note beer. There is certainly complexity here but the yeastiness and the pronounced hop character clash violently, particularly considering this is a medium-sized beer at 7.2% abv.  Medium mouthfeel but heavily resinous. Pretty much perfectly carbonated. It's the weird bitterness that's really harsh here.  Some good points, some bad points. I definitely don't need 6 of these but I'm happy to have taken another look at an old classic.

Smell is fruity and yeasty, brown sugar. Also pretty boozy for an ABV of 7.  Taste-wise, the initial blast is surprisingly malty with a fruity, bready, caramel character.

The smell was malty but nothing else I could really pull out and it was well carbonated but not so that it was distracting. The second thing that struck me was how much this reminded me of a Boston Lager - though with more flavor and bitterness to boot.

Taste. One first shot, I almost pick up coffee-very bitter. As the palate adjusts, a bitter earthy taste takes over-like a very bitter bakers chocolate. Maybe just a hint of sweet maltiness.

Malt creeps up halfway with some much needed sweetness. Notes of singed caramel, toast and a suggestion of roasted malt though very faint. Aftertaste is an aggressive mix and match of bitter, dry, earthy and wood flavors.  Feel: On the heavier side of medium, carbonation is perfect. Oily and relatively chewy with a bone dry finish.

I'm getting hops on the forward palate and this toasty caramel malt on the back palate. It's tasty. Glad I tried it. Nice breakaway from the double IPAs that seem so ubiquitous nowadays.

147,92,alcoholicarrogance,4.36,"Aside from its amusing description on the back of the bottle claiming the drinker unworthy, the really cool art design of the bottle label, and the interesting, alluring name, this beer is so much more than good marketing. The aroma is enticing, smelling of grains, malts, hops, and something almost sweet hidden way underneath all the other scents. It pours a dark brown similar to black coffee with a tan head that looks a bit like a coffee milkshake. The taste at first is all malts, some roasted some not so much, but all flavorful with a slight biscuity undertone. Then it dissolves into hops, slightly earthy, and leaves a long bitterness lingering way longer than expected given the malt-forward beginning flavor. The flavor is full and intense from start to finish, yet it's delicate, full of nuances during the course of each sip, and smooth all at the same time. It's a complex but easily enjoyable ale. There isn't much carbonation and the mouthfeel is silky. It is definitely not a mild lager, so it is definitely not for every beer drinker. But if you're not opposed to hops and like some bitterness in your brew, then give this beer a try. Find out if you're worthy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,jrc1093,3.87,"Canned 12/10/18  Pours a dingy, deep, clear brown with ruby hues and topped with a thicker head of off-white froth; nice retention here, and the glass is left caked with soapy lacing and a steady collar on the surface.  Aromas of dense, earthy hops accompanied by tons of pine with a firm, sappy caramel malt backbone; dark bread crusts and heavily toasted tones linger all around, almost to the point of giving dried wood impressions; building in intensity without becoming especially overwhelming, you can tell the bouquet here is a sign of things to come.  Taste shows bready, heavily toasted caramel malts (resembling an imperial red ale almost) nearly overwhelmed with a firm hop punch and tons of prickly, herbal/earthy pine tones; fairly one-dimensional, but the hops burst to a level of expressiveness against the malt backbone that add depth to the upfront simplicity of the profile.  Mouthfeel battles between a sticky malt and the massive, drying hop presence that ultimately overwhelms it; robust, prickly, sticky body with a present but tempered medium carbonation; unabashedly aggressive, a palate wrecker really, but there’s an unexpected (and unusual) drinkability coming through.  This can be one-dimensional, but it does one-dimensional pretty well; the hops are aggressive and expressive, and the malt profile is comforting in its place in the background while rearing its head as a balancing foil to the hop aggression.

Color is deep copper hue with some light filtering through. A bit darker than I expected. Nose gives up a red ale scent, caramel, a bit of hop. Toasted malt with a bit of biscuit. First taste reminds me of an imperial red ale. Big, bold taste. Flavor melts to a smoot malt background ending with a slight bitter finish and a delightful alcohol warmth. Medium mouth feel with just enough carbonation to tickle the tongue.  This beer sets the bar for a year round strong ale. A bit in your face but for a beer that’s available year round, a superb choice. If you are looking to shake up your taste profile and are a fan of ales, than you need to try this one. Nothing fancy.

147,92,Captdolfinpain,3.51,"Poured from a bomber into a glass tankard.  L - I really like how this beer looks. It's a really dark amber red with just the tiniest bit of haziness. It has a nice creamy head that stuck around for some time. Not much lacing, but the mug was still a little wet when I poured the beer in, so that might have something to do with it...  S - It really smells nice. I don't drink dark beers very often, so smelling a grain forward brew is kind of refreshing. Toasted, rye maybe? (still learning to distinguish grains). Sweet, malty, nutty, caramely. It smells nice, pretty simple aroma, nothing special.  T - WAY more hops forward than I expected. That piney hop bitterness really dominates the flavor here, with just a background of the malt I go with the smell. Coffee flavors are right up there with pine hops...It's a really bitter beer, which I don't exactly hate, but there's a right way and a wrong way to incorporate bitterness. I feel like this beer just went out of it's way to be almost offensively bitter.  F - I really enjoyed how this beer felt. It's silky, creamy, and coats your mouth in a good way.  Overall - This beverage looks and smells great, reminiscent of a stout, although it's clearer and a bit less smokey on the nose. It's a very bitter beer, and I guess they warn you on the label ""This is an aggressive beer. You probably won't like it"".

147,92,MichaelJT,5,"This is my first and only review. I created this account just to give this beer a review. First of all, I am biased. I used to live in San Diego and have always like Stone Brewery. Secondly, I am not a beer aficionado by any means. I cant go deep into articulating what makes a beer good. All I know is if I like it or not. I actually drink Hefeweizens a lot more which is the complete opposite of IPAs in term of taste, but ABA still ranks #uno for me.  With that out of the way, I usually drink it out of the 22oz bottles. Their branding is a little trollish imo but it doesnt really take anything away from the experience. Love the dark color. Hops instantly fill your nostrils when you pop the cap. Other reviewers smell fruity aromas, I dont. Its straight hops for me and kind of musky smelling. The first sip is always the best...BOOM, a freaking atom bomb in your mouth. Yes, its hoppy and its strong. Deal with it. The taste sticks with you the whole time, it never abates and is always at full mass. I agree with other reviewers who say there are hints of coffee. I have been to the brewery near San Diego and I know they don't use coffee as an ingredient, but the flavor is there somehow. This beer has a bite to it, bitter and sticky. Not to be binged or chugged. A nice beer to chill with and maybe use as a beverage for a meal, though, I tend to like it by itself. Drinking to whole 22oz should get you nice and warm but like I said, it should never be binged and you shouldn't be sauced off you butt.  So thats my rant. Very personal beer for me. Good taste and a good experience. Cheers!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Flinty copper metalic up front morphs into bitter hoppiness which remains on tongue. A bit of toasty, buttery malt. Alcohol is not pronounced in taste, though ABV of 7.2% A hint of smoke. Low carbonation. A bit Guinness-like, but more intense flavors. The prominent take-away is the acerbic hop bitter aftertaste. 16 oz can lasts a bit longer, obviously. Good beer to have when you're having only one.  Note: I tend toward the more citrusy, floral, refreshing qualities, like in a good IPA, so maybe I'm a little harsh on beers like strong ales.

T: immediate munich, vienna and caramel malts followed by a pleasant clean bitterness, I cannot stress how grain forward this beer is, the hop profile is not; to my palate; particularly distinct however, opting for bitterness before any real flavor, though some slight piney, resinous notes do creep out as the beer opens up, along with some slight peppery flavors. I also noticed later some berry notes coming out through the malt. M: Just the right amount of carbonation, with a medium body that feels slightly sticky. O: This was not my first experience with this beer though it may as well have been, since it has been such a long time since I had tasted it. I have to say, I don't really like stone, and I think this is by far the best stone beer I've ever had, that being said I don't love this beer either, it's very nice, and I do quite like it, but I don't love it. It manages a real lack of personality in the hop department with a good amount of grace by having an exceptionally curated grain bill.

I know, it's supposed to be Arrogant b/c of the name, but it still rubs me the wrong way, Yes, it's got a good amount of bitterness and it's in your face and it doesn't try to smooth that out in any way, but something about the approach turns me off.  That being said, I learned to like Stone much more sometime after this when their IRS and regular IPA and things like Xocoveza became available near me.

The aroma is mild, not as arrogant as one would expect, a little hoppy; The flavor is robust, strong, hoppy, with a bitter aftertaste; Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth for such a strong tasting beer, with moderate carbonation.  The first time I had Arrogant Bastard was in a restaurant. The large bottle was past its drink-by date. I shared it; we enjoyed it. Later I bought a six of 16 oz cans. It was so arrogant I had to have a snack with it to sooth the aftertaste. Then I forgot about it in the back of the beer fridge and this one last can, the one I reviewed above, is way past its drink-by date. It's not my favorite ale, but it's not bad. I like it better when it's aged. I get a kick out of the arrogance statement on the can. ""This is an aggressive beer. You probably won't like it...."" and on for two long paragraphs. What a hoot.  Update: My memory of this beer was that I didn't much care for it. The review and rating above are better than I had remembered. I thought I'd give it another try, thinking that maybe my appreciation of IPAs and their ilk has matured. Anyhow, I love the appearance - that big fluffy head. I didn't see bits floating in it this time. It does have a strong flavor. As it claims, it's arrogant. I think my memory of it is on the money. It's very hoppy/bitter. Not a favorite, but it certainly has character. I reduced my ratings for Taste and Overall from 3.75 to 3.5. I can't find a date, so I don't know how fresh it is. Judging from my review above, I think this one must be fresh.  1/22/21 And again. A good looking ale. First taste - tangy, somewhat bitter but not too bitter, smoother than I remember. The taste isn't great but it isn't awful. Leaves a sour aftertaste. I keep buying the beer, from time to time, to see if I like it better now than the last time I had it. No, not really. It is robust. Arrogant, but not all that pleasant a flavor. And Yet, after the head has dispersed and it is tepid, a couple of swallows left, it's arrogance has mellowed, melted into an old fart, like me.

147,92,ChrisCage,2.53,"A- Pours a dark copper color with deep brown hues noted as well.....it is clear but it looks chill hazed straight out of the can. The head is caramel eggshell color in hue and the head starts about one finger in thickness, eventually settling down to a thick-ish film over the brew. The head is rather good, showcasing artwork that looks mountain like, and the carbonation is difficult to see, but with some close scrutiny, I see tight, lumbering columns of foam trickling to the top of the liquid.  S- This has characters of brown sugar, caramel and dark toffee, slight warm spice and molasses malt sweetness right up front, with balancing notes of fresh hop cones, slightly Earthy spices such as black pepper and thyme, and a raw grainy farmhouse quality. Alcohol tinges hit my nostrils with a slight ting but nothing to embarrass the brew. Rather nice overall!  T- This is intense overall, and I'm not sure what everybody is so enamored about to be honest. There is a huge blast of bitter hop immediately followed by big metallic astringency that hits all points of the palate, especially the back of the tongue. If I try really hard, I get some sort of malt character, caramel and not much else really....I find the alcohol content overbearing in this one as well......the bitterness lingers much too long and simply put it is rather off putting.  M/O- This has a medium body, full flavored with booze and hops and is a 'tad' over carbonated. I don't think this is very drinkable and I'm not on the bandwagon....sorry. I will pass on this in the future and think too much effort was put on the 'arrogance'.....I think the brewery was too full of themselves on this one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,doktorhops,4.17,"I thought I did this one already... turns out it was the Bourbon Barrel-Aged Arrogant Bastard, easy mistake to make as in my memory the labels looked EXACTLY THE SAME [actually there is a slight difference in them]. So here we are Arrogant Bastard! What? No I wasn’t insulting you, that’s the name of the beer... jeez, Arrogant Bastards. That was insulting you, see the difference? No, well maybe I was insulting you then. As far as American Strong Ales go this is the most popular on a little site I go to called Beer Advocate - 10,712 ratings so for, here comes #10,713! Will it be as great as Bourbon Barrel-Aged Arrogant Bastard? Only minutes will tell, around 30 to be precise.  Poured from a 473ml can into a Duvel tulip.  A: This beer is truly arrogant from the get-go: exploding right out of the can and into my sink, jeez Arrogant Bastard. Colour is a deep tawny brown, cloudy or hazed? Hard to tell, I’m gonna say hazed, with a sand-coloured head that simmers down after the initial explosion leaving a nice thin blanket, and lace. 8/10.  S: Boozy from the off, with a mix of dark fruits (prune, plum, dates) and a freight train full of molasses - this thing is as unstoppable as a train with Jon Voight riding on it. Aroma comes across with a decent amount of sugar but not a truckload, it’s not Founders Curmudgeon in that respect (my dentist BANNED me from drinking that beer when I told him a piece of my tooth broke off while I was sipping it). Pretty balanced aroma based on several scientific whiffs. 9/10.  T: Booze, booze, booze. Dark fruits (prune, plum, dates) and molasses. Much like BBAAB (as in the other Arrogant Bastard) there are woody notes throughout. Sweet mid palate, but not overbearing, bit better balanced than Curmudgeon in that respect - Curmudgeon is a bit “all aboard sugar train heading for candy mountain!”. Finish is long dry, with a medium herbal hop bitterness. Overall flavour is tasty, the booze isn’t crazy in your face, and there’s plenty going on. 8/10.  M: Definitely no Curmudgeon when it comes to mouthfeel - medium bodied with a slight creamy carbonation - had better, had worse. 7/10.  D: Yes I know Founders Curmudgeon is a different style beer but it’s the beer that most springs to mind as I sip this... I miss my Curmudgeon days (which are paradoxically behind me). I feel after drinking half a glass that the hops are a tad aggressive now (I found that in BBAAB too). Still decent though. 9/10.

147,92,Snowcrash000,4.45,"Pours a deep, dark ruby red coloration with a large, creamy head. Smells faintly of biscuity, caramel malt, toffee and red berries, with a hint of citrus and pine. Taste follows the nose, with a firm, slightly sweet and caramelly malt presence backed up by bitter, resinous, hops and notes of pine, toffee, red berries: redcurrant, strawberry and citrus: grapefruit, lime peel, as well as just a hint of chocolate. Finishes with a strong bitterness and some red berries and pine lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation  This is an expertly crafted and balanced Amber Ale that has great complexity to it without sacrificing drinkability. The balance between sweet malts and quite bitter, resinous hops is exceptional here, with some nice layers of citrus and red berries, as well as slight toffee and chocolate notes inbetween. Arrogant Bastard will forever be my go-to beer, as long as I can get it fresh anyway.

147,92,ScruffyHanSolo,4.28,So I will admit I was pretty skeptical in trying ABA because i had heard some unpleasant reviews about it which I feel are very unwarranted (more on that in a second) but I decided to take a leap of faith and give it a try. I am very pleasantly surprised with ABA overall and it actually shattered my expectations. This ale is definitely on my top 10 list of market ales to try because it is extremely tasty and satisfying. Now with the bad reviews I feel a lot of people expect more of a nut ale or brown ale taste to this similar to like a Samuel Smith. This ale actually has a pretty high hop content to it and its closer to an IPA than something like Sam Smith or Newcastle. If you don't like hops then I recommend staying away from this particular ale. All in all I give it a 4.5 and its something I would definitely drink again.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I was supposed to have band practice, but after driving all the way out to the storage space, NO ONE showed up! On top of that, the code for the gate wouldn't work, so I had to drive right through the thing. Luckily it was just a 2x4, so my 2000 Nissan 200SX took care of that no problem. I was at my boiling point. I called all the guys on their home phones - no answer (of course!), so I left a message. Then I tried sending them all a text message - no reply. Then I sent each of them an email to let them know to check their voicemail and read their texts - crickets. It wasn't a total loss at least, as I was able to fire up the space heater and get some song writing done on Old Faithful. I guess you could say I have a songwriter in me, dudes. And once I got this Strong Ale in me, things really took off. I wrote a pretty F'n sweet tune! It sounds like a love song, but it's really about playing video games.

I then quickly got into British, Irish, and German beers and forgot all about this one. Last night my girlfriend bought it for me on a recommendation of a mutual friend who knows what sort of beers I liked. I was amused to see it, so I cracked the top off, gave it a sniff, you could really smell the hops as well as caramel, slight hint of toffee, as well as some darker notes.

147,92,nicholas2121,4.49,"Arrogant Bastard Ale brewed by Arrogant Brewing, with an ABV of 7.20% This American Strong Ale pours out a deep, deep golden amber color with a nice off white head. The color is more of a brown than a amber. There is a lot of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich, with grassy grains and malts. You also pick up a nice mild hop bitterness, in the smell as well. Now for the taste, it is bold with flavors. You first pick up on a hop bitterness lots of it to. Then the brew mellows out with the grassy grains and malts. The hop bitterness is a nice note to this style of brew. There is a lot going on in Arrogant Bastard Ale, it is bold with flavors. The body of this brew is a medium to heavy, but not to heavy. However the body is heaver than most brews on the market. This Strong Ale has a lot going on in it, the hop bitterness is what makes this brew stand out from the rest. Even with the strong hop bitterness there , this brew has a real nice balance to it. There is nothing overpowering about this brew. It is really hard to pick up on 7.20% ABV in this brew. This strong ale just goes down that smooth. The mouth feel of Arrogant Bastard Ale is Bold, Hops, Clean, Smooth, and Refreshing. Overall I'm giving Arrogant Bastard Ale a 4.50 out of 5.

147,92,Solo007,4.58,"Poured from a 16 fl oz can into my old reliable tulip glass (sniffer).  Those Arrogant bastards know how to brew an excellent beer. And one of the very best strong ales anywhere is their Arrogant Bastard Ale. The Bastard pours a thick head of tan that resembles light caramel that stays around a long time - really nice. Colour is a dark caramel like a well-aged congnac only hazier. Nose has (again) caramel, burnt sugar. The smokiness hides some of the floral notes, but it's there. And I detect a little bit of apple (granny smith?) that gives it a tiny bit of cider. Taste strong malt representation: It's smokey, dark caramel covered on a biscuit. Not much of a coffee nor chocolate as one might expect from a beer like this, but there is something of the two that was roasted in the process. Hops of floral and pine notes, woodsy like autumn. When drinking it starts off refined with a good carbonation to remind you that this is not a brandy, it's a strong American ale; It remains strong upon the finish, but gives the drinker a bit of a break by going down easier. OK, now I detect some chocolate on the finish. Man, this beer is so good! this ain't no Budweiser, this ain't no Coors, this ain't no fooling around. This is what beer ought to be and for people who know and appreciate drinking the good stuff. Highly recommended.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Jesterr44,3.81,"I appreciate the message from this beer. ""Perhaps you're mouthing your words as you read this."" Great stuff. Message sent to those who think ""cold"" is a taste. A problem I suppose is that this message has already been sent. Repeatedly. Within the BA community at least, I don't think most reading this need to hear that message. And while it does have a nice bold taste, there are so many choices out there now for beers which taste better than this one. Anyway, the beer pours a beautiful reddish-brown colour with tall offwhite-orange head with good retention & lacing. You can just see how creamy this beer is going to taste. It is for the most part transparent, but in holding it up to the light I see a fairly fine uniform particulate. Not fine enough to call the beer cloudy, but too small to be floaters. This beer has a heavy sugary bready malt aroma and taste. The odour also includes a dominant sour fruit smell; plum I'd say. It's in the taste as well but it wouldn't be quite right to use the word sour for the taste as there are so many sour beers out there now which are truly sour. There is a nice creamy mouthfeel which leads up to the bitter clean ending of this beer. Overall I just don't think I would seek this beer out again but if you're one who wants a big malt taste and aren't into IPAs or any of the other styles which go beyond malt forward, you may like this beer more than I do.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,Mindcrime1000,4.25,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a glass.  This is an excellent-looking beer. Dark, reddish-amber with a perfect tan foamy head. It just looks like a good beer, and all that that entails. Not beautiful, but ruggedly handsome.  Aromas of hops and toasted grains are very forward, with just a hint of ester-y banana and a touch of booze in the background. Very aggressive bitter aromas, with the roasted and malted ones taking a bit of a backseat. Well-balanced, yet in your face.  The flavor is a study in amazing balance between a variety of disparate, and prominent notes. Whereas the nose featured more bitterness, the palate is assaulted on the front end with a healthy dose of diacetyl and cocoa sweetness, followed by toasted grain, and finished with some strong, yet judicious hoppy bitterness. The hops are strong, but far short of an IPA, lending a citrusy, but not quite piney quality that is just about perfect.  The mouthfeel is down the middle medium, but it is definitely a dry finish, helped along by the hops and booze that arrive at the finish. Neither cloyingly sweet nor overwhelmingly bitter.  I've passed on this cocky offering a myriad of times, for whatever reason. Maybe I thought the name and the description on the label seemed ""gimmicky."" Not so upon finally tasting this. It defies categorization. It has the malty sweetness of a dark ale, mixed with a hoppy, but not ""hop head"" crispness that keeps me coming back for more.

Pours a dark Amber with a full off-white head. Leaves a nearly unperturbed sheet of lacing all the way down the glass.

Slight bitterness at the tail end, faint hint of booze but not overpowering by any means. Carbonstion is very light and leaves a nice coating on the mouth, not unpleasant.

It's got a high ABV and it's made by a well known brewer. The name is also super catchy. This is a recipe for a great rating. It's a good beer, if I could only have one beer for the night.  If I want to throw back a couple, it can become a bit much. It's bitter. It's strong. It's blunt. It tastes like all all the other imperial beers were thrown into a mason jar and you took a swig. I think this is a good thing?  I will continue buying this beer because of social proof / herd mentality and also because I think I like it. It's got flavor. I wish it had flavor and smoothness.

147,92,1sophrosyne1,4.51,"Consumed a month ago from a can shipped with love from parts unknown -- took detailed notes, but delayed getting this review posted. Still had to do so, because it was just that damn good...  Into an IPA glass, the bastard poured almost clear cordovan with very thick creamy and supple tan head. Persists long with sticky lacing that enhances the experience nearly to the bottom of a glass nursed for nearly 30 minutes.  In the nose, there's vanilla with a drizzle of butterscotch fairly early. It's sweet and then starts to turn to fruitiness, but never quite unleashing the citrus, pineapple, or evergreen of big hops. You can tell they are there, and a bit of orange blossom squeezes through to make that clear. But the aroma is complex with many layers, not allowing any essence to dominate. It's remarkable, but somehow a tiny bit of a letdown at the same time.  Over the teeth, the first sensation is of fruit; then almost scorched earth and toasted campfire coffee usher in a dry midsection that allows the hops to emerge. It's just bready enough to contain the bitterness and let you chew the grapefruit pith and pineapple that are stained with dark berry and kissed with white pepper. Persistent bitterness from hops dwells to give it a different sort of length. Too bitter for some, it seems, but I think it's malty backbone contains the bittering to make it absolutely compelling to taste more.  The body is just above medium with silky smooth mouthfeel and lively crisp carbonation. It tastes juicier than it feels in a way that is unexpected. Not problematic, but somehow I thought more squishy oils were coming, and then the soul of a Belgian poured out of this American Strong Man... Perhaps he really is a bastard.  Certainly, he is entitled to be arrogant. Overall, the blend of creativity and classic craftsmanship is superior.I can't believe it took me this long to try such a well-known brew.

One of the reasons I love stone brewing...nuff said  I've had many of these beers before but chose to review a can from Stone's Berlin Brewery that I recently visited.  0.5 l can poured into a snifter. Pours a beautiful dark maroon (almost a purplish brown color). Distinct smell, very complex and hard to explain, almost like funky cough medicine. Taste is very malty with a hoppy bitterness that's unlike an IPA, complex flavors as you let the beer warm up, very enjoyable. Overall this has always been a go to beer for me. I like to sneak this in my rotation once every 3-4 months to change things up a bit. Long live the bastard!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,HorseheadsHophead,4.26,"L: Pours out a ruddy amber color that looks a bit darker in the glass. Clear, with plenty of rising carbonation, topped by a big, pillowy beige head with near-perfect retention, and tons of lacing.  S: Aggressive piney hops; pine resin, earth, some herbaceous spices like clove and fennel. Backed by a massive malt backbone that is equal parts sweet and roasty. There's a sugar, caramel/toffee candy side, and then an acrid, baking cocoa and black coffee side.  T: The sweetness hits you upfront. You get lots of a caramel and toffee, which then transitions down the roasty side of malt spectrum. You get dark chocolate and dark roast coffee then. As soon as the roast hits you, so do the hops, bringing earthiness, massive pine, and clove/fennel. The malts disappear completely into a dry finish, bringing an aftertaste that is exceedingly bitter, just lingering forever of intense hoppiness. The pine sap, earth, clove/fennel, and even coffee roast lingers forever on your palate, punishing you for many long minutes until the next sip.  F: Medium-bodied, well-carbonated, full and smooth on the palate with gratuitous amounts of malt sugars and absurd hop oils.  O: Not quite an IPA, not quite a barleywine, not quite an amber ale, this unique beer still stands for what it is: an ARROGANT BASTARD ale.

Pours the colour of dark tea with a reddish hue. Hazy. Moderate head settles to a long lived full film and gives up a steady run of spidery lace throughout. Lots of malt up front. Burned toffee, dark fruit. Sweetness is immediately offset by a pretty substantial dose of bitter and drying hops. The difference between the front end and the back end of the brew is striking. Lingering fruit. Yup, lots of alcohol, but not at all boozy, so prepare to have this sneak up on you.  Tasty, but not for the faint of heart.

147,92,Stooven,4,"Something's changed? This sample was a 16oz can purchased as a single in Kenosha, WI, within the drinkable period since canning. What the smell portends as its customarily solid, Redwood-like IPA loses its resonance almost immediately and unleashes instant cottonmouth. Better as it warms, but astringency prevails. The feel, follows suit. Perhaps not a good can, but almost certainly not as good a beer as when it flew under the Stone banner and was bottled. As a Midwest-based Stone fan who also recently enjoyed a 12-sampler featuring Ruination, IPA, and Citrusy Wit, and one who previously ranked this beer as among his top 5 overall, I am disappointed and would need a great pour at a bar to convince me to try this version again.

147,92,StJamesGate,3.94,"CAN (from Stone Berlin) Bright chestnut with piles of creamy ecru foam. 4 Caramel snaps, chocolate-covered cherries, faint orange oil. 3.75 Toffee and candied apricot, some toast crust, maybe a speck of prune, then orange rind, resin, pine forest floor and a touch of honeysuckle with a scorching linger. 4 Salty, chewy, almost medium. 4  Jun 10 packaging date; four weeks in the can, so no excuses for hops fading - just seems like scant aroma additions to begin with. But, Lord, are there bittering additions. This lands firmly in the early 2000s “bitter is better” school of hop bombs; it actually comes across way hotter than the ABV because your taste buds are hyper-sensitized. It settles into itself, and reveals darker malt notes - a huge Premium Bitter or a less juicy American Amber, maybe - though in avoiding being overly sweet (a touch of chocolate rather than a ton of crystal?), it actually comes out a bit thin. Lagunitas does this kind of thing, but are a whole lot more fun with it. Still all about the naked IBUs, which just come across today as… unrefined.

Mouth: The hops linger on the tongue. I can't really get anything else from here.  Overall: This beer was a top 10 favorite of my fathers', and I was very excited to try the beer based on that alone. After seeing the brewery post ""unworthy wednesdays"" where they posted quotes of people who said AB was ""too hoppy"", I had to try it.

Caramel, vanilla, roasted coffee bean, toasted dark bread, chocolate, sugar, faint honey, some fresh fruitiness , overall the aroma is complex with many layers yet not too sharp and quite aromatic.  Start with fruitiness that is reminiscent of dark fruits and citrus, roasted and toasted profiles reminding of burnt wood, smoky, coffee, and chocolate thereafter exhibit bringing a dryness and astringency for complexity sake. Hops also lend a touch of peppery in the middle where same time malts provide a big caramelized sweetness and breadiness to keep the tempo of flavor in balance. Persistent bitterness from hops dwells at the end also lingering as a long tail of pleasant aftertaste along with a toasted and roasted traits that come back to together dominate with hops at the ultimate point.  The body is medium with silky smooth mouthfeel and lively crisp carbonation sweeping through the palate, very dry finish.

147,92,LeRose,4.02,"Poured from the iconic gargoyle bottle into a tulip, this beer is a deep brown with a reddish hue. The head was ample - at least a couple fingers - tan color and persistent until well after the last swallow. Great cling to the glass. This is a visually appealing beer on all accounts - beauty in a glass.  Aroma - maybe I expected more, but it seemed a bit weak. Vaguely citrus/resin, sweet and bread-like, brown sugar leaning toward molasses.  The taste is the ""ah ha"" moment. Starts off pretty sweet with the malt dominating, then a smooth transition to a hoppy character followed by a retrained yet ample kick of bitter. The taste washes over the tongue in a continuum. I get some grapefruit peel, and an almost cedar-like resin quality that washes over the malt sweetness. Maybe a little nutty flavor chips in. As it warmed, the beer became a little more flat for me - the profile sort of mellowed out and the flavors seemed more muted. Maybe let it get a bit too warm though.  Feel - creamy, dry, a bit sticky on the lips. Carbonation moderate, medium bodied. Not a palate shredder.  The beer is beautiful to look at, I felt a slight letdown with the smell, but the taste is so interesting in how it evolves. Nothing dominates, the different flavors take turns - hard to describe, but there is definitely an initial, middle, and late taste to this beer with no arguments - just substitution. The bitter lingers a bit, but that just invites me back for another round of sweetness on the sip. I guess it has to be called something, so an American String Ale is as good as anything - certainly broad enough to capture what's going down with the beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,taxandbeerguy,4.14,"22oz bottle served cold into a tulip. Enjoy By 4/14/16, so I'm a little late to this party, but fairly certain that this will still be good. This is one of those American classics... a beer that has been around for a long while (in craft terms anyway) and while others may have surpassed it, it is still brilliant and a beer that every advocate should venture a try.  Appearance - Dark and ominous, a muddy brown color is poured with mahogany and red highlights depending on the light. A small half finger of yellowy-tan head, which recedes fairly quickly leaving a little puff of film on top. Did I mention hazy?  Smell - This is well... different. Some fairly potent hop presence, although more of the earthy and pine resin variety, but there's also a floral component too. On the malt side, the grain is hidden and there's a little booze but i'm also picking up molasses, making this sort of like a hoppy-doppelbock but an ale instead of lager. Hence the American Strong Ale classification.  Taste - Initially quite bitter with and earthy and grapefruit rind type of flavor, just plain bitter. Some middling sweetness momentarily than a rush of booze kicks in. This definitely feels like a stronger beer. Finishes with a little black coffee and more earthy bitterness. Interesting and not quite my pint of beer, but unique in that I can't say I've had anything quite like this. Leather possibly?  Mouthfeel - Carbonation is modest, body is reasonably light all things considered with just enough stickiness to make it interesting. I like it a lot.  Overall - Arrogant Bastard Ale lives up to its reputation as one fine tasty beer, that's got a few things going on that don't normally seem to work (molasses and earthy hops), but they come together to form a unique beer that is quite enjoyable. Would love to procure a fresher sample for comparative purposes, but if it's this good after 4 months, it certainly has eared it's reputation.

147,92,wadebieber,4.27,"This was the first beer I reviewed on here, when my journey into the realm of craft brewing was young. Three years later, I am back, and I am re-writing my review.  This beer looks beautiful. I did not have the most appropriate glassware on hand, so it went into a standard shaker pint. Still, it was a dark ale color, a satisfying redish-brown. Poured from a 22oz bottle, it developed a light tan head that left nice lacing at first, but dissipated relatively quickly when compared to other beers I appreciate as much as this one.  It smells well balanced. I detect both the malts and the hops in equal proportion, but personally find it difficult to distinguish if the hops are more fruity or floral. One thing is for sure, I do not detect a pine aroma, and that doesn't show up later either. As the beer warmed, the alcohol made an appearance in the aroma of the beer, and it was very welcome to the party.  My palate is a bit rusty at the time of tasting, but the caramel hops are there for anyone to see. It finishes with the hops, and it is just as bitter as a solid IPA. There are much more flavors in there, but I am off my game right now. I will have to come back a third time. The finish seems to have a bit of dryness to it, and I think I detect that because of the contrast between rich caramel malts and the strong hop presence at the end.  The mouthfeel is also exquisite, having a light carbonation that allows the beer to still feel as though it has a heavy body, while tantalizing the taste buds with the buzz of carbonation.  I am a very big fan of this beer. It is one of the first that really awakened in me a desire to understand craft beer, and it continues to be an excellent brew, available nationwide (USA based reviewer), for a great price. If it is not a beer you have had, I urge you to change that. You will come back for more.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,HappyGuy12345,4.44,"Sampled from a tulip glass at the San Diego Airport (Stone Brewing at Terminal 2) Appearance: Brownish-red color with about 2 fingers of white foamy head. Smell: Strong aroma from hops are easily detected. A more subtle mix of fruits is also noticed. Taste: Similar to smell. Strong bitterness from the hops that is well balanced by the sweetness of malts. Mildly bitter aftertaste that is not uncommon to strong ales and IPAs. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Goes down smoothly. Overall: Stone Brewing rarely makes a beer that isn't enjoyable. This one surely does not disappoint, and I highly recommend this tasty strong ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,davidperez,4.34,"Served in a snifter, it pours a beautiful clear copper with ruby glare, with a one-finger ecru head, foamy, with good retention. Easy to form head again after a swirl, you can see it is really carbonated. It also leaves a very good lacing.  The aroma is very intense as you can sense it without getting too close to the glass. Very hoppy bouquet. You get notes that you would expect in an IPA or IIPA. Tropical fruits as in passion fruit, tangerine and melon. Earthy hop aroma too, caramel, and slight butterscotch. Very unique.  The flavor follows the nose. Upfront the sweet notes of the fruits and caramel and some tamed bitterness, but quickly the earthy hoppiness and the butterscotch gain prevalence and transform into pure bitterness. A boozy note underlies the whole flavor and it almost gives it a vinous quality, and a malty sweetness comes through as well. A roasted character is also perceived. The aftertaste is long and mostly that of caramel and earthy bitterness. Oily mouthfeel, full body, very smooth, nice carbonation.  A complex and Sui géneris beer. Scrumptious.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Not quite as impressive looking as I had hoped but it still is pretty unique and I can't think of any other beer that quite looks like this one. Smell is intriguing. A lot of sweet and malt based flavors come through: caramelized brown sugar, toasted bread, some dark fruits, etc. But there's also a definite hop oil type aroma to it. Lots of complex roasted, caramel, and earthy flavors that develop all throughout the palate. The bitterness slowly comes in and is strongest right on the finish. Feel is full and rich, some alcohol is noticeable and gives a warming feel. Finishes dry, leaves a lingering bitter aftertaste. Surprisingly easy to drink, I didn't struggle at all to finish the whole 22 oz and came out feeling pleasantly buzzed! I was very impressed with how balanced the flavors were and how surprisingly delicate and complex some of the flavors were.

147,92,HotDogBikeRide,4.23,"Poured from a bottle dated 1/07/16, and enjoy by 4/06/16. Upon opening bottle a unique intense hop/malt rush met my nose that quickly subdued to the air, especially after being poured. Translucent copper beer with a fluffy head consisting solely of micro bubbles. Immediate lacing all around the glass, sudsy-est lacing I've ever seen.  Smell after pour consists mostly of pale and roasted malts with a little bit of bitter hops. Taste is pretty much exactly on point with the smell, but is just oh so refreshing. Bitterness becomes apparent in the semi-dry finish, starting a vicious cycle of rinse, repeat until the whole pint and 6 ozs is finished. Did I mention I have work in a couple hours? LOL.  Reading the history of the beer, it seems like an industry standard of sorts, and I can see why.

147,92,josiahschlender,4.35,"I was surprised to read on the distinctively Stone Brewing bottle ""Arrogant Bastard Brewing."" Whatever the organizational structure, I've always enjoyed Stone for their aggressive and bold approach to brewing. I'm not always in the mood for a beer that takes itself so seriously, but this bomber of stiff brew hits the spot after a long week.  Iconic screen printed bottles are a nice touch. This beer pours an opaque dark red with lots of browns in my snifter. It takes some extra agitation to coax an off white head that fades to a thin bubbly slick. Not the prettiest beer, but it has a unique look.  Smells are hoppy and boozy. I'd never guess this is ""only"" 7.2 ABV. They say smell is the sense most linked to our memory, and this reminds me of some of the barley wines I've had. Flavored also remind me of a hoppy American style barley wine. Lots of malts that toe the line between caramel and dark roast with mostly citric, lemon-rind hops.  Feel is slick and full, with a long bitter finish. Not the kind of brew you forget what it tastes like after the last swig--the flavor sticks around a long time. For this reason it could easily overwhelm a food pairing.  Overall, I'm really enjoying the aggression because I drank it when I knew it's what I wanted. Very well crafted and a break from the norm.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Coming out of the bottle it looks like a medium to light copper, however, once in the glass it looks like a lovely combination of brown, mahogany and ruby red. A big foam head tops things off as does a frothy and sticky lace that retains throughout. Very pleasing on the nose. The dark fruits hit me first and remind me of strawberry jam. I also smell citrus hops. Also, throughout there is a bready and biscuity malt aroma. The taste is truly dynamic and complex. It is initially sweet on the tongue like dark fruit and caramel malts. However, a big hops flavor and bittering soon envelops the mouth, making it almost IPA like. In the hops there is some citric grapefruit like zest along with pine. The finish alternates between dry and sweet fruit. Overall, the bitterness is moderate to high but with excellent malt balance. The alcohol is barely felt. The mouthfeel is truly amazing. I would describe it as medium bodied and dangerously drinkable. Unbelievably smooth and almost creamy. The carbonation is just about perfect; soft but with some tingling on the tongue.

147,92,Sabtos,2.44,"Clear copper to dark red with a toweringly tall khaki head that practically hovers over the rim not unlike a slow pour lager, settling very slowly and airy while leaving coral lacing all over.  Smell is harsh, spicy and pungent while taste follows through much the same, with an almost blood-like iron quality and a supremely prickly, resinous bitterness on the finish. This detracts most from the feel, where it can become painfully sharp over time.  It sometimes reminds me of drinking an old Great Lakes beer from the bottle--which is just a bad idea, generally speaking--though I can't deny the nostalgia factor. Thus I find myself yearning to revisit this abomination at least once every winter--if not to warm the belly, then out of pure masochism--most recently in 2022 just as the temperatures began to drop.  I never really understood the mass appeal of this and other palate wreckers from the mid-2000s.

T: Comes on with a decidedly bitter hop note that leans toward pine & resin. This develops into a very evolved malt character on the mid palate, featuring bready notes along with dense, heavy spice - think clove & nutmeg.

My past was all mass produced garbage. Anyway I liked these so much I started trying whatever craft stuff I could get my hands on. I've tried a lot of bourbon barrel aged stuff (it's okay) and IPAs (NOT a fan - chick beer) but the brass tax of the matter is this: if you like a good (non-barrel aged) stout or porter, but aren't a fan of the crazy critrus bitterness of IPAs AND used to like (crap) mass produced beer, this is your beer. I love it. I am glad it only comes in 22oz (cause I'd get hammered) and sad I rarely find it on tap (which has a more plumb taste on the front end).

147,92,tomghiley,2.66,"looks great, smells okay, tastes not too good :( thoroughly disappointed with this beer, considering Stone have put out some far superior products. I've got to say, I think the best thing it has going for it is the label that attempts to make you feel bad/stupid for not liking this beer, unfortunately, I've had way too many good and great beers to appreciate this one, and for that, I just can't say that I was too impressed.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jngrizzaffi,4.45,"Pours a cloudy dark amber color with a small foamy head. Head retention is mild. Lacine is good. Has a nice, smooth, malty, piney aroma with some hints of tropical fruit and caramel. Very smooth taste. Malty and piney a the same time. Great malt to hop transition. Slightly fruity with hints of toffee and some astringency at the end. Pronounced bitterness that is very much appreciated. Medium bodied with low carbonation.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,kitch,4.15,"A 22 oz bomber with an enjoy by date of 9th October 2015 and poured into a snifter glass.  Appearance: Poured a very nice clear dark copper amber colour with a one finger tanned head with low retention but leaves spotty lacing.  Aroma: Strong caramel malt aromas followed by maple syrup, toffee, almond and pineapple. There were also hints of minerals and also piney hops towards the finish.  Taste: Sweet-ish roasted caramel malts mixed with grapefruit and pine hop bitterness. The finish is a very nice long lasting bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Mid to full bodied with medium carbonation and nice light alcohol warmth.  Overall: I haven’t had the chance to try many American Strong Ales, but this one was really good. Great balance and the lasting bitterness at the end along with the light alcohol warmth make it really enjoyable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,Strat58cat,4.53,"This is no pale ale. This is Arrogant Ale. Arrogant or confident? Is the difference whether you live up to it? Perhaps this ale is more confident than arrogant, since it lives up to the extravagant billing.  The color is a deep reddish brown. The head foams up without restraint and retains, leaving a lot of lacing down the glass.  The smell is neither overly fruity nor overly piney. It's simply right. This is an extravagantly hopped ale, but it's been hopped with the right hops! I'm looking at you Samuel Adams Hoppy Red. There's none of the stanky hops found in Sierra Nevada's Flipside or Hoppy Red. It's a delightful aroma blending fruit, pine, spice and ale.  With Arrogant Bastard Ale, the wildly extravagant hops are balanced by the extravagant malt. Nothing is out of proportion here. The hops bring the fruit, pine and spice with the requisite bite, but it's never unpleasantly flavored or oily feeling. (I'm looking at you Sculpin IPA.) The malt is powerful and stands up to the hops. The result is a balanced, very fully flavored ale. Yes, the ale is somewhat demanding but it's never unpleasant.  The malt has plenty of character and body. The feel is of a powerful, full-bodied ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,constantine_272,3.84,"Beautiful dark brown with a thick viscous dark tan head. Pretty good head retention as well. Slight murkiness. Smelled slightly mineral with a dark brown sugar sweetness. Taste start off with a light steel and mineral flavor but quickly turns earthy and malty. Dark roasted grains and minor molasses and coffee notes added a tich body through the midsection. A sharp dry bittering finishes the the beer. After getting into the second half of the 22oz bottle? The rich earthiness dry texture turned to more acrid dirtiness. What once stood out as the best quality to me slowly morphed into the Achilles heel. Maybe chalk it up to being an aggressive beer, but it built and built and ended up more than I wanted after 22 ounces. The feel is dry and slightly grain and sandy. Overal this is a great unique beer. A nice change of pace from the run of the mill ipa.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,stlfatguy,4.16,"Opened a bomber straight from the fridge and it fizzed over. Poured a great looking, dark, reddish body with a huge, tan head. Head was thick and creamy. This is a really good looking beer. Smell didn't hit too strong... light maple, and something roasted. Taste was not what I expected. It's like a stout, thrown into a Boston Lager, and chased with a hop bomb.  The carbonation kept a nice, thin head until the end of the glass, but it wasn't prickly on the tongue. Tasted smooth and thick. I swear i caught a chocolate covered cherry at the beginning of the sip, then caramel roasted malt, and on to a heavy, bitter hop taste. Aftertaste was a little too tart on the tongue, but besides that you wouldn't guess at the abv.  Stayed away from stone for a Long time. The bottles turned me off and looked a little too gimmicky... something I would have seen way back in my fraternity days just sitting on someone's shelf for decoration. Bombers were on sale so I gave it a try. Glad I did. I'll definitely be back to pick up a few more.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,50wolves,4.11,Appearance - pours amber with small head that disappears quickly. Presence of astringency with lacing that does not hold. Cloudy. Aroma - smells of vanilla. Taste - mild sweetness that has a bitter lasting aftertaste. Touch - feels fresh with some astringency. Overall - would recommend. Easy to drink and the mild astringency compliments the flavours well. Does not feel like a 8% beer.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,Justin82,3.93,"Poured into a snifter from a 12oz bottle Look: This honestly might beer one of the best looking beers I've ever seen. I hate to give 5s but I'm almost tempted. Deep, semi-clear mahogany in color. Not all light gets thru, but most. Pours with a beautiful 3/4 inch tight bubbly head that clears fairly quickly to a thin layer. I seriously wish i could stain my floors with this beer Smell:Caramel and bread. Very slight pine and floral, but no distinct hop aroma considering how bitter this beer is Taste: Very bitter, very bready, reminds me of bread crust. Was expecting maybe more toffee/caramel flavors but i really didn't get any. Feel: Low to medium carb. More watery mouthfeel than i would've liked Overall: Don't really drink a lot of american strongs, so i don't have much to compare it to, but an overall pretty enjoyable beer. I'll certainly pick this up again at some point when i feel like a variety pack or if its the best thing on tap somewhere i go but i don't see myself really seeking it out individually",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Wer34truh,3.81,"Dark brown body, with a clear white head.  Arrogant Bastard has a distinct malt smell, with some underlying citrus present.  The taste reflects the small, with a lot of malt and hop flavor. A very subtle caramel/chocolate flavor in the aftertaste, otherwise the malt and hops dominate.  Great body with very mild carbonation. Just to my taste.  Overall a really good beer, which I'll gladly have in the future. Even though it's not the type of beer that pushes the frontier of brewing.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,mick303,4.18,"A - from bottle (at LCBO) bb of sept 3. Dark mahogany brown with a really full initial head and good retention and film. Sticks around quite awhile and beer itself is quite clear and has a nice ruby hue.  S - rich aromas of sappy piney hops, sticky caramel malt, nutty, treacle fudge, maple syrup, all overlayed with really pungent hoppy aromas, lemons, strong florals.  T - fairly big body with lots of interesting malt flavours, munich malts and caramel, maple syrup, bready and slight roasty and nutty. Also a lot of really robust hop character, pine resin, florals, lots of aggressive hi-alpha hops, rich dried fruit cake, with raisin and prune notes. Finishing with a nice dry bitter finish.  F - nice initial prickle of carbonation, quite a smooth body with some malty sweetness and growing bitterness, finishes long with a substantial body.  Quite a well done and balanced ale. Interesting interplay between the competing malt and hop flavours, aroma is quite aromatic, while the taste I feel falls off a bit. Still this one was a nice treat.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,hoptheology,2.78,"A : Cherry-mahogany colored body with 80% opacity. The head is giant and popcorn yellow, with tons of IPA-like lacing left behind as it recedes slowly. Initial measurement is at 3 fingers. Simply stunning.  S : Some armpit-like smells, some aged mahogany, faint nut and cellared fruit. Definitely a cousin of the IPA from the aroma.  T : A robust roasted maltiness out front, followed by a fresh slap of wet hop, mixed with grapefruit rind and lemon rind, and then...metallic diarrhea. The finish is slightly smokey but tastes like a blended sweat sock and crushed aluminum pop cans. That finish is...well, it kills the beer. But the more I drink it the better it gets?  F : Dense, substantial, creamy...with moderate carbonation underneath and a dry finish.  O : An interesting tryout, although I wish I could have bought a smaller bottle.

A good balance of caramel and pine resin with earthiness and dried hay in the background.  Quite bitter through and through as expected. Caramel mixes with pinesap and grapefruit. This one lacks layers of complexity and is best at proper temperature. The finish is long and tasty.  A medium body with creamy texture punctuated by modest carbonation and light astringency. Alcohol is as expected.  This is an iconic and certainly enjoyable beer. However, it has never been, for me, a standout as the hype would lead one to believe.

147,92,thehyperduck,4.4,"650 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Sept 3 2015 and served slightly chilled.  Pours a murky copper-amber colour with a brilliant ruby-red look under the light. It is initially crowned with just over one finger's worth of frothy, yellow-beige coloured head, which proceeds to seep away steadily over the next couple of minutes, depositing a smooth, uninterrupted ring of lacing as it does so. A bubbly cap and foamy collar are the eventual remnants. The nose features an aggressive, no-holds-barred onslaught of rich, bold aromas - toffee and brown sugar sweetness, prune/plum, raisins and even a touch of cocoa. The hop contribution is similar robust in scope, showing off some intensely dank, piney, resiny bitterness, as well as plenty of pithy citrus. The booze also opens up a little as the glass has time to warm.  This is a goddamn delicious beer. Rich with malt flavour from the start - I can pick out some toffee sweetness, bready malt and some lightly toasted biscuit flavour. The dried dark fruit notes (prune/raisin) from the nose are less prominent here, but still detectable mid-sip before being washed away by a tsunami of hops. It is eminently piney, dank and resiny, with a lot of grapefruit citrus and some vaguely floral qualities. This one finishes on the bitter side, with a lingering mixture of resin and pith in the aftertaste, as well as some restrained residual sweetness. On the lighter side of full-bodied, with low levels of natural carbonation that gently agitate the tongue - which allows this strong ale to possess an impressively silky-smooth mouthfeel. This is a truly outstanding beer, and I now understand the hype behind it.  Final Grade: 4.4, an awesome A. It's not hard to see why Arrogant Bastard has remained relevant for more than a decade now. The craft beer scene has been moving onwards and upwards ever since its release, and while some relics from that era don't quite hold up these days, I'd argue that Arrogant Bastard is one antiquity that continues to stand the test of time. My main regret is that I didn't try this beer years earlier - because it probably would have REALLY blown me away back then, before the force of 1000+ reviews numbed my palate. Glad to see it finally available in Ontario (though I wish they could have brought it in before the currency exchange rate went to shit - 9 bucks a bomber is pricy).",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,JLaw55,3.75,"This was interesting. Not really a mind blower, but I do have quite a bit of respect for this beer. There are plenty of layers of complexity behind this brew and it hides it's higher ABV very well. The malt is the most dominant flavor here, with the rich, slightly sweet roasted flavors staying front and center. Layers of caramel, oak, and earthiness popping up as it settles on your tongue. Hints of coffee and hops begin to pop up toward the end. The hops give a slight balance to the carefully crafted layers of flavor put forth by the malt. This beer has a certain level of drinkability that keeps you coming back for another sip. There is a slight carbonation that prickles the tongue throughout and keeps this brew dancing on your tongue.  Not going to knock your socks off, but it is a pleasant experience and a great example of balance between malt and hops, while still keeping the malt in the forefront. I think it may be a bit over rated here, but is still worth a try and a possible revisit.

147,92,hopphead31415,4.06,"I vaguely recall trying this beer a few years ago, but wanted to remind myself of how good it is. It boasts the amusing angle of it being too good for you to try which is summed up by its catchy name and the iconic demon smirking at you with his own glass of this excellent beer. It has 7.2% ABV and lots of flavor.  Look-It pours a beautiful mahogany amber ale color with deep copper read hues. The head is very thick and is probably about 3 fingers and settles to 2 fingers. The head is tinged with an off-white brown color. It leaves thick creamy lacing on the glass.  Smell-This one smells of sweet bourbon barrel malts and a spicy hoppiness to follow.  Taste-You first taste the sweet malts that taste like this beer was cellared in a bourbon barrel to give it the oaky flavor and the dark color. There is a noticeable yet subtle spicy hop component that follows and the carbonation mixes well with these flavors.  Mouthfeel-It feels of silky sweetness and a pleasant coating on the tongue.

Features the cavalier and unapologetically aggro Stone hopping style, wherein everything is amped up several notches and unflinchingly in your face. Mouthfeel is medium, with a crisp and dry character. Balanced and smooth yet an aggressive ale. Nice trace bitterness in the finish. Sweet bready malts fade without being cloying.  Extremely potent collision of hops and malt, that balances out enough to allow for a showcase of caramel, biscuit, breadiness, citrus notes (especially grapefruit and blood orange), and all of that dank, dank, piney, resiny goodness.

A classic that I believe was the first stone beer I ever had. I just reached a stirring realization, that this is essentially original stone pale ale on steroids and seriously hopped up.

147,92,Jadjunk,3.7,"Brewed in the style of an American Strong Ale. Available as a year round release in 22 oz. bottles, 12 oz. bottled 6 packs and on standard draft.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a Stone Brewing pint glass. Served above 55 degrees Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a frothy foam head of a golden-caramel tone over a mildly hazy copper body with light, lively carbonation. Retention is very good and lacing is moderate and draped. 4.5  (Smell) Bready, biscuity caramel grains and syrups, ample fruity and piney hops with a moderate bitterness, relatively clean and simple overall despite a moderate potency, the malt and hop characters are perceptibly dominant in the aroma. 3.75  (Taste) Smooth, bready caramel malts forward with a low sweetness, fairly dry with a moderate hop profile of piney, resinous and light citrus hops. Finishes smooth and moderately dry with a lingering malt dryness and a light piney hop note with a subtle bitterness. 3.5  (Mouthfeel) The texture is slick, lightly creamy, clean and moderately dry. Carbonation is light, generating a modest frothiness and a faintly crisp finish. Balance is slightly hoppy bitter and grainy over sweet. Alcohol presence is light and there are no notable off characters. 3.75  (Overall) My first foray into Arrogant Bastard Ale came in my early years of drinking, as one of my very first craft beers, and it genuinely took me by surprise at how startling the flavor profiles were. Nearly 5 years and a much more seasoned (or weakened) palate later, it's not pulling the same weight that it once did with me in particular, as I find the hops and malt character much milder now than I did then, and the striking lack of malt sweetness unusual. It is much more drinkable now than I found 2010, although I would only find myself visiting this beer on rare occasions. It continues to carry an excellent price tag per bottle, which is one reason I recommend this beer to budding craft ale connoisseurs, as it demonstrated to me early on that there was a great deal of flavor to enjoy in craft-brewed ales, this is a good starting point for many who want to explore this potential. 3.75  Stone Brewing Co.'s Arrogant Bastard Ale 3.7/5.00",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Texture is surprisingly frothy - lighter and bubblier in feel than you would expect for the style. I found that letting this warm a good deal smoothed out the bitterness and brought out the complexity of the malt.

Every time I visit my local establishment which has had Arrogant Bastard since day 1, I get a draft glass of it. It used to be great but has suffered from inconsistencies over the last couple years. I had some today from a keg and it tasted more like an IPA than arrogant bastard. I've had some in the past that tasted more like a Yuengling. I thought maybe it was a keg issue so I grabbed some in a bottle and it tasted different in the bottle also.  I'm starting to think that the bourbon and oaked versions were just batches that didn't turn out right.

Good balance between hops and malt; pine and orange prominent, but quickly relieved by some malt. Definite floral note, quite welcome in an otherwise bleak and almost ordinary profile.  M: Tiny touch of a syrup quality, but overall drinkable.  O: Hopbomb for sure, but even a non-hophead like myself can appreciate this, once we get past the nearly overwhelming pine and bitterness.

147,92,MaximalC,3.65,"Pours a murky garnet color with a sumptuous head of cream-colored froth. The aroma smells primarily of bread and grapefruit, with some caramel and pine resin as well--maybe even some bubblegum if I use my imagination.  The nose is a good forebear of the taste, as pine resin and grapefruit pith are the headliners, making you well aware of their presence from the get-go. The malt does its best to push back though, with flavors of toasted bread and caramel, while the yeast adds a zesty character of its own, making for a rather lively and balanced concoction. The medium-high body and ample carbonation create a full, velvety mouthfeel that takes some of the edge off of the bitterness.  Overall, this is a bold and flavorful brew with a terrific presentation and mouthfeel. The hops are a little heavy-handed for my tastes, but it’s Stone, so I knew what I was getting into.

147,92,humuloner22,4.27,"I will admit this is not the first time I have had this beer. Long ago and many beers back I thought I was up to the task of drinking this beer. Intimidation was the key to the label, but I thought I had a palate that could handle it. I was wrong, it turned out to be a drain pour. I know? Crazy! So many years later here I have returned to see where I am with this one...  Appearance: Nice amber almost brown ale appearance. Head retention is pretty solid as well throughout the imbibing of this bastard.  Aroma: Sweet candied malts, some hop presence but not a lot. This beer reminds me a lot of a dopplebock in that regard. Which the first time I drank it I had no idea what the hell a dopplebock was!  Taste: Sweet candied malts dominate, some bittering hops but nothing really that intense. Its a well rounded beer in that regard. Its a well balanced beer and very tasty.  Overall: I will admit this one has had some cellar time so it might have lost some hop bitterness. I remember it being extremely bitter the first time I tried it. I do not get that this time around. Its pretty well balanced over all and not nearly what the experience I had was the first time around. So, I guess I have lapped this one in its arrogance!

147,92,TheIPAHunter,4.31,"Despite not being a style I would drink regularly, the IPA Hunter® owed it to himself to finally get around to reviewing this legendary beer. I like Stone; after all, they do hops, and they do it well. Getting a lot of fresh-baked bread and sugary sweetness on the nose. A bit like raisin bread, but very subdued. Not overwhelming; simply complimentary. Taste follows the nose, but there's unmistakable citrus hops on the finish. On the real. A bit prickly on the tongue, while not being exhausting or heavy on the mouthfeel. There's a fine line between arrogance and supreme confidence. Stone knew what they were doing with this one. I haven't been this excited while drinking a non-IPA since the last time I saw Lorna Morgan rocking some tasteful lingerie.

147,92,fscottkey,3.56,A: [4.25] Beer is a light brown color in the glass. It appears to be mostly transparent. Forms a nice 1 1/2 finger head. The head is an off-white color and has nice staying power. The beer lists the ABV at 7.2% and a best by date of 2/17/15 (in 10 days).  S: [3.25] Smells of bread and malt. The malt is a sweet smell like brown sugar - but not very intense.  T: [3.50] The beer is malt forward at first with a sweet taste out of the gate. Subsequent sips build the bitter from the hops (I have found this with other Stone beers). If you take it slow the balance works really well. I am not getting specific flavors just the sensations of sweet and bitter.  M: [3.75] This beer has low carbonation - it actually felt like a nitro to me at first. The dominant mouth feel characteristic is the long dry finish.  O: [3.75] The balance is there on this beer. The nose was a little weak and I am not getting specific flavor elements on the taste. Overall it is a well made beer. I would drink it again - but might not seek it out. I think that since it is 10 days from expiration it may have lost some punch on the nose and taste.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,Doctor_Bogenbroom,4.7,"Okay, you Arrogant Bastard, it's time to get served.  Appearance: Pours a gorgeous copper/brown into a tulip glass. A nice, foamy tan head with decent lacing adorns the crown of the glass.  Aroma: Strong earth tones. A pungent smell, almost like being in a cavern. And there's a cedar-like, forest quality to it as well.  Taste: I was expecting to get knocked on my backside by the hops, but that didn't happen. Instead, the complexity of the flavors slowly rolled over me like a tide. This is a very well-balanced ale. Again, there's that earthy taste to it, along with a gentle carbonation that tickles the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and bitter on the back end, but not overly so. A nice, almost sandy tingle all the way through.  Overall: ""Complex"" is generally a word bereft of true meaning, but if you want to get an idea what beer drinkers mean when they say it's ""complex,"" then drink this. The tongue-in-cheek reference to being unworthy because you lack the sophistication to truly appreciate this beer actually comes through. I like it.

The appearance was a hazy golden orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within seconds leaving some light lacing running here and there around the glass. The smell, wooeee, wow and hot damn, pure strong bitter hop oils of citrus and pine combining and doing this beer its due service of ""strong"" alright. The taste was pure bittersweet bliss of combined citrus and pine. There's a nice big pine oil aftertaste leading to a dry finish. The mouthfeel sat about a medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Actually, wait a minute, eh, perhaps closer to a decent sipping quality about it. Its just that this one really grabs your tongue for a good pummeling that its kinda hard to put down exactly how sessionable this one really is. Its definitely brutal like an AIPA. Overall, in my opinion, this one does what I believe Stone meant to do, its ""arrogance"" is bitter but isn't exactly one I'd have with food.

147,92,ryan1788a5,4.28,"22oz bottle poured into a globe.  A: Very dark ruby/Garnett color. Clarity is very good. Two fingers of beige head show excellent retention. Lacing sticks in wispy patches.  S: Hops are forward on the nose with an overall earthy and resinous aroma. Subtle whiffs of tangerine and tropical fruits are there too if you let them come out. Big malt backbone isn't bashful either. Heavy toast, caramel, brown molasses. Perhaps slightly candied too. Suggestions of red berries. Well balanced. Over the top in general, but in a good way.  T: Big piney and resinous hop bite. Very earthy. Pine, leaves, bark. Flashes of orange and other citrus fruits. Hardcore bitterness. Malts are equally abrasive. Heavy, heavy toast. Crusty. Burnt caramel. Flashes of berries. Clamping earthy and resiny bitterness never relents and owns the finish. In fact, forget the finish, you'll still taste it when you wake up the next morning.  M: Full medium body. Very smooth and even velvety in texture. That is until the hop astringency cuts through and clings to your tooth enamel. Moderately carbonated.  O: The craft beer scene has changed so much since this beer first came onto the market, but it still feels as relevant today as it did back then. This beer helped define the new era of craft beer. To hell with all those breweries in the early going that were content to churn out some safe ""fizzy yellow lager"". This was brewed in direct opposition to those beers. In fact, it is so ridiculously aggressive that I still find it miraculous that it caught on at all. We all love it today because the context in which we drink beer has changed. Big, aggressive, hoppy beers are now more or less the norm. I wish I could go back in time just to watch people's faces contort as they tasted this, when the wildest beers they'd tried to that point were a pale ale and some mundane amber. We've come a long way.  As an aside it's nice to see Stone pumping the core brand again. With all the one-offs and special releases they've been doing it's easy for the consumer to overlook Arrogant Bastard. The value of this new Bastard Box bomber four pack is so ridiculous that it's a no-brainer buy for the consumer.

147,92,Stevedore,4.02,"On tap at Stone World Bistro in Escondido, CA. Served in a stemmed glass 12/14/14.  A- Dark reddish-brown body. Copper hue. Half finger white head, good retention time, nice collaring. No lacing.  S- A blast of piney hops and sweet syrupy malt. Extremely potent stuff. Rich, intense and pine-forward with some grapefruit that is barely detectable underneath an incredibly strong malt sweetness that does not let up. Wow.  F- The malt sweetness comes out more as a mild caramel, heavy resin type of sweetness that just somehow works quite well with the amount of hops used here. On one hand, it tastes quite malty, but on the other hand, my palate is being blown up by the sheer pine bitterness of this beer. This is what I think Stone set out to accomplish and while it's not my thing, I do have to respect their intention.  M- Thick bodied, syrupy and dry. Bitter pine forward finish that makes this one a bit of a sipper. In some ways tough to drink, but in other ways, so easy to drink due to how flavourful it is. The bitterness can be well above what most people would be used to.  O- Very nice strong ale with a crap-ton of hops in it. The description and the story behind this and Double Bastard is quite novel and I have to give credit to Stone for coming up with these beers, even if they are not my favourites. Well worth trying at least once for the novelty, history and respect for Stone and what they've done for craft beer.

147,92,Redneckwine,4.33,"22oz bomber into tulip  Appearance - Murky, murky dark brown body. 1.5 finger tan head seems to linger eternally, awesome retention and lacing  Smell - Toasted maltiness very prevelant with ample dark fruity alcohol ester goodness, piney/citrus hop resin, and subtleties of toasted spice.  Taste - Starts of with toasty, doughy, nutty malt that brings a dark fruity, semi-sweet quality with it, fruity + peppery alcohol esters and subtle spice notes (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, anise). Hops are definitely here with a lot of pine resin action and some moderate citrus peel mid-palate, then this brew shifts gears BIG-TIME and dries out VERY rapidly, coating the entire mouth with a strong, assertive, hop resin bitterness that lingers and actually builds well after the swallow. A touch of fruity, dry maltiness also lingers in the long finish. Very complex.  Feel - Just absolutely spot-on medium body with plenty of scrubbing carb to get the job done, making this beast feel light for its substantial body and flavor.  Overall - Stone isn't yanking your chain with the narrative found on the bottle: this sumbitch is one hell of an aggressive beer: a big flavor and sensory bomb with a truly assertive bitter bite on the finish that kicks you in the mouth. Maybe the greatest feat is how this brew still feels balanced after the flavor onslaught.

147,92,cjgiant,3.81,"Review on 11/15/2014 from bottle enjoy by 1/11/15: Pours a deep reddish amber color with a small amount of reddish tan head on a light pour (first half of a 22oz). The beer appears pretty clear, but color prevents much light through. Lacing is decent. Nose is grapefruit rind and light pine bittering notes. I get some fruit notes, pitted in nature, and maybe even some cranberry.  Taste is more centered on the bitter, but there is a bit of maltiness to supply some balance. The base reminds me a bit of an English bitter beer, a clean cereal like base, some copper, but with the addition of a hint if fruit (again I get cranberry or maybe white raisin). The hops are what this beer prides itself in, and they definitely pack a punch. Grapefruit and orange hints, pith-based to be sure. Even though this isn't a barrel aged version, there's is a woody to piney flavor and feel as well. The hops seem to provide more bite than the carbonation, and the beer is fairly dry, more so than you might initially think from a clear amber beer, but not enough so to make the beer too one-sided.  Had numerous times before. A very nice beer, and a classic in the craft beer world. A must try once if you haven't had it yet. I only need to grab it once in a while, that's enough for me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,m_hall,4.69,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. Beer pours a clear, deep amber-brown with a thick, pillow-y two-finger tan head that falls slowly to a fillm, leaving copious sticky lacing.  This beer is extremely aromatic- even before actually nosing you'll pick up floral hops, bread, banana, and spicy/citric notes. Would make a wonderful air-freshener.  Flavor wise, the front end of beer has smooth, deep malt sweetness, rich, but not toasted.There is a subtle but discernible alcoholic warmth-it lets you know it's there, but it's well-harmonized with everything else that's going on. All this is offset by an ample wash of grapefruit-like hop bitterness, leading towards a dry finish. Very complex- every sip of this seems to be just a slight bit different than the last, especially as the beer warms in the glass. It's definitely an aggressive beer, as the label promises, but at the same time, very balanced.  Mouthfeel is smooth, slightly oily, lingers in the mouth, almost like a good whiskey. Carbonation is fairly moderate.  Overall, this is a remarkable, fascinating beer... best way I could describe it is like a marriage of a Belgian Ale with an American IPA, and I think fans of either style could find a great deal to love here, with the rich malts skillfully set against aggressive hop bitterness. Powerful, challenging, but rewarding to those who can step up to it. We are not worthy, indeed.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Tastes of caramel malt, bitter grapefruit and blood orange. Smokiness to it with a bit of vanilla.  A lesser brewery might try to catch your attention and call this a mahogany IPA or an Amber IPA; because it is bitter and really showcases the hops and the malt.

147,92,CalgaryFMC,4.19,"Bomber enjoyed in a Lagunitas mason jar glass. The label is frankly awesome, ""yellow beer drinker"" insulting arrogance at its finest. The beer is a murky opaque reddish brown with a comfortable two fingers of notably dark yellow-tan creamy head. Makes me think smoky bar room. Aroma is well-toasted grains, resinous peppery and citrus rind hops, a whiff of raisins, fruity pipe tobacco, aromatic alcohol. Somehow strikes dark/malty and fresh/fruity chords at the same time. The palate starts with bitter spicy hops, some grapefruit peel and flower water, and quickly transitions to nutty toasted malts surprising devoid of toffee or caramel flavors (although these are down there in the mix). A grainy bitterness like burnt Ovaltine and graham crackers coupled with hints of chocolate and walnut. Ample alcohol flavor but this is skillfully done by design. I am getting some peach and more floral notes late. Perhaps a little coffee. Could be the most adept use of fusel alcohols I've yet to sample. Producing a nice warmth about two-thirds through but no (or little) hop burn. Despite these big flavors, the brew is silky smooth yet still rather thick. Caresses the palate. The heavy malts persist all the way through into the finish, which seems astonishingly dry for such a malty brew. The hops are the coda as well as the intro. Has to be experienced to be believed and obviously I'd snag any variants that should enter this still nascent but fortunately growing craft beer market. A near religious experience, on par with Ruination or nearly so.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

There's also a nice bready malt balance in the aroma and flavor as you dial into it. Looks great on the pour, maroon in color and a finger's worth of head.

The first bomber from Stone Brewing Company (Escondido, CA) to make a play on the shelves of package stores throughout the bay state.  Review: Pours medium brown/red-ish in color with a moderate to sticky head. A hoppy yet smooth with a medium finish.

About a 1.5 to 2 finger head (poured this one pretty sloppy so the head was nearly 3 inches at first).  Smell: Extremely grassy, full of hop notes and a slight hint of orange. After tasting, you can barely notice a hint of the malt upon a huge sniff of the beer.  Taste: A quick hit of sweetness followed by a smash in the face of hops, hops and more hops. This is essentially an IPA on steroids (categorized as Strong Ale but you get the picture). At the finish you can notice a quick hit of coffee notes and malt. The bitterness hangs around a bit after a few sips.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied, not a very heavy carbonation but just enough. Bitterness all around this brew but, hey, that's the style!  Overall: This is your typical West Coast hop bomb of a brew. It is delicious but for myself, I could only take a pint of it and then I had to move on.

Smell is of piney hops with a little malt pressence in the background. I also get an alcohol medicinal smell in there as well.  Taste has those piney hops up front. Malts come in in the middle of the taste but not enough for my taste. The aftertaste is dominated by the hops with a resinous medicinal type of taste. It is not as unpleasant as it sounds but that is the best way I know to describe it.  Mouthfeel is medium to full. Bubbles are pretty small and creamy which has created a really dense head that is still lingering on the top as I am half way through the glass.  Overall a really good beer. This is the first Strong Ale I have had and I am not sure why this is not considered an IPA. It pretty much fits that bill in my opinion. I cant think of a time where this would serve a purpose that an IPA could not fill in.

The beer is a dark amber, maybe a little hazy, with moderate carbonation.  A strong aroma of pine and citrus greets the nose, with some underlying brown sugar qualities. The flavor is quite malty, but with plenty of bitterness to balance. Notes of caramel, brown sugar, molasses dark fruit and roasted nuts compete with spicy, floral, citrusy hop notes. Wonderfully balanced and complex, with a certain unique, fruity-nut flavor that reveals itself on the palate at times and is hard to pinpoint. A very creamy mouthfeel and a lingering spicy and bittersweet aftertaste invites follow-up sips. Actually quite a smooth flavor and not overbearing by any means.  An excellent, tasty, full-throated and well-balanced brew that I find rather approachable despite the klitchy marketing hyperbole.

147,92,slym,4.23,"I picked up a bomber of this to go with my last two beers I didn't finish from last night's session. I am glad I did! It's a bit pricey, but worth it.  Great colour on the pour, a deep coopery brown that smells slightly of bread and majorly of hops. Not overly-hoppy, but that's what comes through. A nice 1"" head formed in my pilsner glass and finally settled to a not-very-thin disc of foam that stayed the entire time I was drnking. Heavy lacing appears, and you can easily tell where each sip started and stopped.  The taste... wow. A very well balanced ale, with up-front sweetness from the malts that immediately switches over to the hops for a very nice finish - not too dry, not too sweet. I mean, VERY well balanced, impressively so! Mouthfeel is thick enough without being too chewy, and nicely carbonated. The higher-than-average ABV is well-hidden, no alcohol is really present. This beer is an exercise in balance, it seems! Call it the Even Steven of beers.  Overall, I am mightily impressed with this beer, and will not balk at the premium price next time. I can see drinking this a lot!  EDIT, 7/28/13 - I picked up a bottle of this for $1 less than my LBS at a grocery store, and I am guessing it was much fresher, as it is much more ""hops-forward"" than the bottle I tasted on my initial review.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Thebunnyrabbit,4.15,"A: very seductive looking in the glass, very dark. Poured a brownish 2 finger head on an aggressive pour.  S: Subtly hints of fig and hop were the predominant smell but this beer is not very fragrant at all, barely detected any aroma.  T: Hop and fig presence evident on the taste, definitely not an IPA (which seems like the style the were ""going"" for) but only because of the lack of some key flavors, not for the lack of hop. Overall I'm a little disappointed on the taste, not because the beer was bad but because of that long diatribe on the back of the bottle... made it seem like the beer would be something incredibly unique, which it wasnt. The beer was good and very drinkable so I tried not to let that little speech have an impact on my rating.

Not the strongest smell but Im getting a faint yet sweet amber ale scent reminds me of some nuts. Toasty nuts.  Taste: The head itself is remarkable. I loved that delicious fluff. Anyhow the flavor is bold as hell, strong hoppy taste makes me want more. Thats what I look for in a beer. Flavor sticks with you. A bit bitter in the end however thats what I expected. It all works together in this ale's showcase.  Feel is spectacular, polar opposite of those watered down domestic brews which the back of the bottle rags on.

It has pronounced hops that gets overwhelmed by strong toasted, almost burnt, malt. It leaves a lingering aftertaste that definitely reminds me of a strong stout (not that mother's milk Guinness but more like Bell's Expedition Stout). I know it's not a Stout but the taste and aftertaste sure reminds me of one. It has a decent taste going down, a lot of flavor, not for your Lite drinkers. While there is a lot of taste in every sip, I have had better tasting brew. I was given 3 bottles of this Bastard, I'll finish them but I'm not sure I'll be buying it.

147,92,leantom,4.22,"American Strong Ale. A very diverse style of beer. In fact, malt varieties and hops are different for every beer in this category. Never had the Stone's ASA until not, but I'm glad that I did. Here goes:  A: Nice. Dark amber with a decent head. Beer produces lots of lacing indicating a high protein content.  S: Quite good. Obvious presence of west-coast hops, but the beer is balanced by a nice malt backbone consisting of heavily-kilned amber and caramel malts.  T: Very good. Quite complex, actually. One initially tastes the amber and caramel malts, which are nice and sweet (toffee, caramel and dark candy), but these are quickly replaced by the hops on the way down the throat. A very robust, lemony, resiny grapefruit taste is felt at the back on the tongue, and this lingers long after swallowing. Don't get me wrong; while the hops are predominant, this is a very, very balanced beer. Malt complemented by a strong hop backbone.  M: Excellent. Lots of carbonation, perfect balance.  O: A very good beer and a flagship of the American Strong Ale style. I highly recommend it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I'm glad I waited, though, otherwise I would have HATED this beer if I had it when I first got into craft beers and couldn't handle hop bitterness.  Great appearance. Dark burnt red with a nice soapy head that stuck around the entire time. There was little lacing left on the glass, but that isn't a big issue at all.  With big hoppy beers when you pop the bottle you get that blast of hop aroma that overtakes the room. I got nothing. As I was pouring it into the glass I still got nothing. Put my nose up to it and got a surprisingly tame smell. Slightly sweet aroma that reminded me off some kind of sweet pipe tobacco in my opinion.  The taste is great, though. Perfect amount of spice and citrusy sweet hop balance on the initial sip. The flavors kind of fade quickly and is overtaken by a wave of bitterness that let's you know it's there to stay.  It has a dry, bitter finish that leaves you wanting another drink immediately. So this bastard goes down awful fast. Great beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The smell is actually pretty faint but does have a weak pine smell along with a malty sweetness.  The taste of the beer is sweet at first ,then spicy and then bites at you with a strong hoppy bite.  The mouthfeel of the beer is very nice,smooth and pleasant to drink with very nice carbonation.  Overall this beer is a very quality beer that has a beautiful lacing along with a ""rootbeer float"" type head. I myself find it hard to continue to drink as I progress along. Perhaps the style is not in my taste...

M/D: Full bodied, carbonation on the higher end but appropriate, a bit filling but otherwise drinkability is good.  O: Another one in the great lineup of hoppy Stone beers.

A hefty slightly yellowed head sits on top. Just a bit of visible carbonation. Leaves some nice lacing on the sides of the glass and solid head retention.  S: A solid bouquet of hops is immediately recognizable followed by a malty sweetness. Hops add pine and a spiciness to the mix.  T: Nice blend going on here. Loads of malt are balanced out by a piney spicy hop bitterness. Malt sweetness is pleasant and starts off the brew with a touch of roastiness and carmel. Then the hops kick in and change the flavor to a bitter which lingers into the aftertaste.  M: Medium to full body with low carbonation. Quite dry from all the hop going on here. Booze gives you a little heat and certainly some warming. Remains smooth.  Overall this has been a beer I've enjoyed for years and was surprised I hadnt reviewed it yet.

Taste: I really enjoy the taste of this bastard. It's just a great medium-colored strong ale. A nice alternative to lighter IPA's. And it warms quite nicely.  As with most of the standard Stone offerings, this can be found just about anywhere. It's inexpensive and I always enjoy it. The ABV is ~7.2 but it sure as hell seems to hit harder than that!

A two and a half finger creamy dark peach white head lingers for a long time. The thick creaminess being higher and thicker towards the middle of the glass. It eventually gives way to good lacing, a nice thick ring at the top of the glass and lines of lacing that run down towards the now half finger head.  the aroma is very close to that of an IPA. I smell a strong hoppy citrus up front. Smells kind of like mango's, that's new. Roasted malts and very piney.  the taste is good, but wierd. It's citrus up front almost like a mango, then a strong hoppy piney taste. Its like an IPA, with the hoppy citrus. But a roasted malt balances things out. The after taste is less dry than an IPA also. There is a nice slight bitterness going on though.  mouth feel is pretty light for a 7.2% ABV beverage. although I have no complaints. a medium body brew that has great carbonation. It leaves a nice light citrus feel, followed by a dominate pine clinging to your palate. Pretty nice.  Overall this brew is great. However is it just me, or is this brew a stone's throw away from a red/amber IPA? It's hoppy with a citrus piney knockout. great american strong red ale. I would buy this again.

Has a two finger head that has a slight brown tint to it with decent retention.  Smell- Apparant bready malt aroma with a bit of a roasted quality. Faint hints of dark fruit with some caramel like sweetness in there as well.  Taste- A few things going on simultaneously as it is hard to give a profile: the malt character of the nose is most obvious as there is a bread/cracker note that still has somewhat of a toasted flavor. Hops are there as well with earthy notes of pine. Not much citrus going on here. On the back end there is a spicy finish with only a light bitterness.  Mouthfeel- Moderate with an appropriate amount of carbonation. Extremely smooth which translates to the great drinkability.  Overall- I actually found this pleasant and not as wildly strong as I thought it would be. Maybe this was because the funny label and crazy bragging on the back of the bottle caused me to think this would be wicked strong, oh and the name. Read the label on the back though, it is funny. This is a very smooth beer and really is not a hop explosion, when compared to most IPA's. Not near as strong as Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous Ale (their black ale). That is because it is not an IPA, so it is much more malty. Nice and complex beer. Try it if you're worthy haha.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,MaineBrewing,4.8,"Poured out of 12 oz bottle into goblet, never thought I would ever see this in a 12 oz, hopefully they expand beyond the stone mix pack and put out 12 packs of ABA. This has always been one of my favorite and go to beers since I started drinking craft beer.  A - Poured a solid 2 finger off white head with tinge of tan. Ruby in color, translucent with orange highlights around the edges when held to the light. Head dissipated after a while but was always foamed over and lively, abundant lacing through-out... this beer always looks fresh.  S - Nose is a great hop forward but strong malt character rounds it out. Notes of pine and resin from the hops and a strong toasted malt presence, with burnt sugar, and caramel notes. Has a smokey, bacon-y essence that's barely discernible but adds a layer of complexity. Slight pungent yeast and a little alcohol.  T - Taste is what a beer should be, IMO. Loads of hops from flavoring hop notes of resinous pine, herbal, peppery, through the bittering spectrum with loads of IBUs at the finish. Bittering hop character lingers in your mouth for an extended time. The malt cuts through the hops with a great unique to this brew flavor. I would guess it may be toasted malts that provide a smokey depth. It is very rich, but at no point is it ever too sweet, or sweet enough to cut through the hop bitter. The yeast bouquet makes a welcomed peppery appearance towards the end, and it finishes very clean/dry.  M - Ample carbonation and medium body, would be what I expect for the style, less sticky then some other stone offerings.  O - This is just the picture of a balanced american strong ale. Highly hopped with IPA quality hop flavor, but an amped up malt character that has a unique flavor profile I have never had in another beer. This is a great, if not the best, example of the american strong ale style that I have had yet.

It has a bitter pine needle taste from the beginning of the tongue until the end and leaves the back of the throat tingling. Alongside the hoppy flavors, there's a caramel malt with hints of indistinct dark fruits.There's a dichotomy in this beer and the hoppy characteristics don't work well with the malty ones.

An amber ale with a lot more hops and more of a biscuty, malty taste to it with the lingering aftertaste of booze...that would be a start but it still doesnt do it justice. Its pretty damn complex.

To me its the weakest aspect.  Taste is mostly bitter, with a decent maltiness thats adds to its complexity. Hints of dark fruit and caramel are there, along with brown sugar, but the taste is mostly one dimensional, but it works.  Feel is light to medium carbed and medium bodied.

147,92,dougbassett,3.57,"One of the ""1001 Beers You Must Taste Before You Die"" -- #43 of the ones I've reviewed here.  This is a very odd beer. Some things it does remarkably well, other things come out quite poorly.  Aesthetically it looks right -- Stone Brewing beers always seem to look fantastic in the glass and this is no exception, a really beautiful mahogany brown topped up with a light brown head that, if you pour it right, will linger forever. They also nailed the mouthfeel -- this has the ""sticky"", substantial feel that you would want in a beer advertising itself as an ""Arrogant Bastard"".  The nose is usually described as dark fruits and pine and that's true, but a little deceptive. It's a fairly weak hit of that, even when I let the beer warm up in the glass it never got much beyond ""pretty light"". I'm reminded of Stone's Smoked Porter, which would have been a better beer with more of a smoky nose. What is really surprising, though, is how out-of-balance this beer is. The light fruit on the nose is even lighter to taste, the flavors are mostly centered around a gigantic hop blast. It's not a bad hop blast but it's pretty one-dimensional, just a slap of piney hop bitterness that slowly fades away.  I confess I don't get this beer -- the hops are too one-dimensional for it to be a hop monster, and there's not enough fruit in here to make this a really good strong ale. What you end up with, actually, is something like an overhopped American Pale Ale -- not exactly bad or undrinkable, but certainly nothing all that amazing, either.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Smell: Strong hops aroma apparent immediately, with faint hint of malty sweetness.  Taste: Very strong bitter hops taste, but not overpowering. Giving way to malt and yeast flavors, with bitter hop flavor lingering on palate. Interestingly, the bitter hops are both the first and last thing you taste, with other flavor profiles (mostly malt, with a touch of yeast) cropping up in between. Makes for a deep, complex flavor profile.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, with just a small touch of carbonation.  Overall: A great beer, especially for lovers of hoppy ales. The hops flavors are very strong, but don't overpower the rest of the flavors. Not a good introduction for those not accustomed to this kind of brew, and not the beer to start the night out with if you're planning on drinking more than one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,rdilauro,4.29,"Pours a dirty muddy river brown but crystal clear! Very small and short lived creamy white head. The nose was more malt than anything. I did pick up on some hops, the citrus and pine nut aroma. There was also a scent of spice, something along the lines of pale vanilla.  The taste was big round and very full. Most of the malt exploded into my mouth, filling every part of my mouth and tongue, so I got to experience all its characteristics  There was a shade of dry bitterness at the end, something as if I was finishing up a smooth brown whiskey, but no whiskey overtones here",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,drdiesel9483,4.11,Look - Has a dark brown color with a great tan head and great lacing. Smell - Toasty Stone fruity caramel alcohol smell.

T - More pine, with a blast of grapefruit and hoppiness. Bitter comes in quick, along with the sugars and malts that keep things from getting to harsh. A close that keeps the citrus notes coming, along with an abiding bitterness.  M - For as powerful a hop brew this is, the drying is only moderate and does not absolutely wreck your palette.  O - This is a beer that asks for, and deserves, attention. Delicious, uncompromising, and tough, it is a compelling drink that deserves periodic revisiting.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

T: Caramel, coffee, pine needles and grapefruit-rind at the end.  M: Almost creamy with some carbonation and alcohol bite.  O: This is a really good American beer.

The aroma is pine resin and hops with a rich malt background.  The taste is similar but even richer with pine up front, fading into a grapefruit flavor toward the finish, rich caramel malt, slightly sweet to balance the hops, hints of coffee, smoke, and biscuits. Finishes dry with a lingering grapefruit/pine aftertaste that somehow makes you want another.  Medium/full bodied, very smooth, almost too drinkable with only the slightest hint of the alcohol.

Appearance: Beautiful glossy burgundy color, with a nice cream colored head. Carbonation is immediately apparent. Good lacing.  Smell: Up front hops presence, a little bit of a vegetable smell, and, this being on the strong side of ales, a definite kick of alcohol in the nose.  Taste: Pretty good. Very complex, for sure. Huge hops presence, and in the aftertaste theres a pretty strong note of vegetables (can't place it exactly, I wanna say celery or kale, something in that realm) that give this a really savory flavor. Probably not for everyone, but I was intrigued.  Mouthfeel: Alright. Not amazing. Carbonation seemed a little low once I actually tasted it, which was surprising since it was so prevalent in the appearance. You can feel the alcohol in your throat in the aftertaste.

147,92,terradactle,4.17,"After trying Stone's IPA and loving it, I decided to pick up a pint, 6oz bottle of Stone Arrogant Bastard ale at a grocery store in VA. I was not disappointed.  Appearance: Pours a dark caramel color with a thin head. This was maybe the least appealing aspect of this beer.  Smell: Hoppier than anticipated. Rich, complex and enticing scent.  Taste: Lives up to the scent and then some. Smooth at first, with a grapefruit-like kick towards the finish. there's a pleasant mixture of hops, malt and alcohol that lingers in the mouth after you swallow.

It’s a pretty heavy beer to drink and very malty, the alcohol presents itself fairly strongly at the finish Overall I think this is good but its rated 93/100 on BeerAdvocate and I don’t understand why…l Its good, but there are much better ones out there in my opinion. I have had almost every single Stone beer that I can get my hands on in this area and I think it;s overpriced and often times lets me down.

147,92,DrCDPriest,3.37,"Interesting name and imaginative backstory for the beer. I've tried it on different occasions, and have found it fairly consistent in what to expect from this brew.  Appearance - Pours a clear deep amber, more to the brown tint. In using a pint glass it had a nice head, about a finger an a half, and a small amount of lacing.  Aroma - You can smell the hops upon opening, very high hop nose with a bit of spiciness. If you love hops, the aroma won't disappoint you.  Taste - The taste truly follows the aroma. It tastes as it smells which helps you appreciate the distinct series of flavors. It begin with hops, a bit of spicy malt followed by what I'd describe as a bitter citrus grapefruit effect.  Mouthfeel - It is a medium body feel, a little on the flat side (on multiple occasions from different shops), and seems very light in the carbonation, a bit more might help those middle malt flavors pop a bit more.  Overall - This is a very nice beer for those loving a strong hop experience with bitter citrus after tones. Definitely an enjoyable experience.

147,92,avillax,2.72,"I'm a bit surprised about the positive reviews on this beer. I hope they didn't fall for the legend on the back of the bottle.  A- Nice caramel color, seemed to need a bit more carbonation S - lots of hops, pine, hoppy, hoppy T- All I could taste was hops, it was so strong that at the beginning I had half a pint alone and then had it with steak, just like I thought, the taste of the steak was completely masked by the bitter hoppy flavor of this beer. It definitely didn't pair up with any food and at time had an unflavored cough syrup after taste, so bitter like gin. Completely out of balance. M - good consistency, but extremely strong bitter hoppy flavor, long lasting.  I didn't know if I had a bad batch, however when I was choosing at the supermarket, I was aiming for the one with the least hoppy flavor since I had tasted other beers from this brewery and always thought the hops were out of balance, and surprise!, I got something really out of balance on hops.  The Stout and the one they brew on oak barrels are the best out of this brewery, but a total let down, if the hop is so strong you can't pair it up then that's telling you something.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,innnervison,4.77,"This is my first Beer review so i will give it my best shot  I bought this beer for mainly the name sake and i was not disappointed this beer was a feast for every sense imaginable.  sight: pouring this beer and watching the glass fill with a beautiful crimson amber beer that quickly darkens into a rich dark red and a thick white head making this the beer you want to show to your friends.  smell: you are immediately hit with a strong hops sent but there are a lot of dynamic elements in play here. while the hops jumps out first there is also a fruity sent that if i had to guess i would say grapefruit, roasted coffee, sugar, chocolate a truly rich blend of smells that give you a strong hint at the beer to come.  taste: rich decadence is the best way to describe this beer. a slightly syrupy mouth feel that delivers a rich tapestry of flavors that if i would have had seen a list of them i would not think they would work. a bright grapefruit flavor with caramelized sugar notes. the bite of the hops is there but subdued by the weaving of flavors. after the initial sweet the tides shift to the rich smoky coffee and light chocolate flavor that is a great tail ride for this beer as it is hard to find a beer that can activate taste buds for every flavor. Also for a beer with a 7.2 alcohol content the alcohol taste was virtually non existent. the beer has a beckoning aftertaste that begs for you to grab another drink.  as you can tell by my rating and my review i loved this beer i think that it is a must have for anyone wishing to cut their teeth in the beer world and if i was more experienced in reviewing i would have spent more time on the taste of this beer cause there is a very complex amalgamation of flavors. my only complaint is that the only size you can get is that big bottle while a regular six pack wouldn't do it justice the big bottle is a little bit intimidating to some drinkers.  have a great day",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Boca-X,4.18,"Poured from a Bomber into a snifter. Deep red amber hue, almost a liquid velvet red. Nice white/yellow head with beautiful alcohol lacing, sticky throughout my drinking.  Malt and hops up front on the nose, light spiciness with a hint of lemon, maybe pear, brandy?  Just as with the smell, hops and malt overtake the tongue. Nice carbonation, a dry shot of sweet brandy, a hint of honey, followed by a bitter, burnt toast on the finish. I'm shocked at how smooth it is considering the bitterness of the hoppy finish.  This is considered a strong ale, I think for the in your face hop smack down. Yes the alcohol is there but it's hidden pretty well, doesn't feel like a 7+ ale...that could be dangerous. I think a bomber is a perfect size for consumption. Much more and either the buzz or the hops would take over.  This is my first Stone brew, looking forward to trying more, looking forward to adding this Bastard into regular rotation in my beer fridge.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

A- Pretty deep amber color, nice persistent head, good lacing. S- Mmmmm mm!You can smell the hop spiciness and awesome malt profile. T- Yup, thats a strong ale. Alcohol is present, but it ties in good with the other flavors. It is welcome. Spicy and floral hops. Malt makes itself known and it is awesome. Perfect synergy- its like a malt and a hop bomb all in one. The hops sort of linger and takeover, being a lil more prominent, but just under what Id consider an IPA. M- Chewy, full bodied creamy goodness. Smooth, thats why I like the presence of the alcohol, so you dont drink too many of these. Overall, this is probably in my top 10 beers.

Made you wonder if you were drinking a DIPA instead. There were touches of malt but I got slammed with intense bitterness. Everything seemed out of balance as I began to wonder if maybe I was not worthy as the label said. After about 10 minutes the beer warmed up to an amazing mix of citrus, caramel, hop bitterness and sweet malt, everything fell into place and was in perfect balance.  M - Medium body but once it rounded out the beer had a full flavor mouth feel with just a tinge of alcohol. A nice smooth finish.

147,92,Big-Frog,4.75,"Throw modesty out the window. Stone Brewery is justifiably allowed to call this beer arrogant. You know why? Because this beer exudes confidence. This beer goes to the rock show and steals your girlfriend because you aren't as interesting nor nearly as satisfying as this beer. This beer could walk into Anheuser-Busch, steal a clydesdale, and ride out bareback screaming, ""where's your crown king nothing."" Yeah I'm not joking. The origin story of this beer is very entertainingly documented on the back of the bottle. I encourage you to read it.  This beer has a rich taste that is comparable to none. It has a dark amber appearance, and a deliciousness that demands your attention. Regardless of your beer drinking preference, you will enjoy this beer. Unless of course, Budweiser and Yuengling are your chart toppers, in which case, you wouldn't even be on this website to begin with, because your palate would be anything but educated. This is no time to be humble. There is no pride before the fall at Stone Brewery. Only the pride in knowing that if you try this beer, they have again broadened someone else's horizons.

About an inch and 1/2 head that sticks around for most of the entire time you are drinking it.

147,92,Hops4Pops,4.94,"22 oz bomber A: Side poured into a pint beer mug. Large, 3 finger head, tannish off-white in color. Very slowly receding leaving a sticky glue-like lacing on side of mug and creating a pillowy cloud-like head as it recedes. Lacing is staying put all the way through finishing the mug.Reflective light reveals a dark brown chocolate color. Shining a light through the beer reveals a slightly hazy, dark red amber color. Carbonation is excellent. Bubbles are from foam sized tiny up to a cluster of large bubbles in center of glass up to 1/4 inch. An absolutely beautiful beer. S: Resiny citrus hops, grapefruity, malt, a slight sweetness. Very nice, very balanced smelling. Nothing stands out a lot. Perhaps the hops stand out more pronounced than anything else which is a bit of a surprise considering it is not an IPA. Nonetheless it is very nice. T: Same notes as smell but pretty much in reverse order. Slightly sweet malt flavor followed by hops and a crisp slightly dry finish followed by a lingering bittersweet aftertaste of toffee, caramel and coffee. Awesome. Very balanced. Only a hint of alcohol in the taste. M: Smooth and creamy up front with a crisp bite in the background followed by a tingly feel on the tongue and a slight warmth from the ABV. Very much inviting me to take another quaff. O: An excellent American Strong Ale. Because the characteristics for this style are so wide of a range, it absolutely fits the style even though the ABV is on the low end of the scale. A excellent ale. Near perfect. I love it. This beer has the right to call itself Arrogant Bastard in my humble opinion.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Auraan,4.17,"Poured a rich, transparent reddish brown with a half-finger off-white head, receding to an off-white ring leaving some lacing at the top of the glass. Rich, gorgeous color but a little low on the head. Scents of caramel, toffee, some brown sugar, more prominent as the beer warms, light grapefruit and other citrus, fruity esters, a hit of alcohol and a bit of toasted malt. Quite nice, but not near as hop forward as I expected, more malt and alcohol. Flavor begins quite bitter, with far more hop character than the aroma betrays. Hop character is mostly pine resin, but with some citrus peel bitterness. High hop bitterness is balanced by a malt backbone with caramel and toasted malt flavors. Towards the middle and end of the sip there is a bit of brown sugar appearing alongside the other flavors and some flavors of alcohol. Alcohol becomes more prominent as the beer warms. Aftertaste is bitter, with some grainy and toasted flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly sticky and semi-drying with low carbonation. Very easy to drink, maybe a little light bodied. Overall a good, fairly complex strong ale. The hop bitterness is very high balancing the sweet malt flavors. Pretty good, however I prefer Double Bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

It smooths out to a flat, clear brown ale with a brownish-white head.  S: All I get is hops, malt, and some booze. But it's nice.  T: So this drinks like an IPA or maybe even a DIPA. The only difference is the malt backbone. I get fresh hops, malt, slight caramel, maybe some raisins, and grass.  M: Light end of medium bodied, but kind of buttery. It's got a dry touch to it though somewhere in there. The carbonation was kind of disappointing for me, because I expected more.  O: Not a bad brew. I've had it before a while ago, but I'm just now reviewing it for my own keep sake. Arrogant Bastard Ale has a monster flavor. It's good to try at least once.

Aromas are toffee, light malt, a touch of hoppiness. Initial taste is the typical Stone bitterness. It fades a bit as you drink more. Taste of toffee, lightly toasted malt, grapefruit. Mouthfeel is nice. A touch of creaminess. Overall, this isn't a bitter bomb like Ruination, but the bitterness is there.

Pours a dark amber, like a Sam Adams fighting a pile of Lobsterbacks with a brew in one hand and a musket in the other. Smells overwhelmingly like hops, but luckily for me, tastes like a nice, hoppy IPA with a good amount of malty backbone to balance out the brew.  Overall, if you're a fan of the so-called 'East Coast IPA', which experience has lead me to believe is any sort of IPA that has enough malts to balance the hoppiness, you're likely to enjoy this brew.

147,92,brurevu,4.25,"From my tasting notes: With my first taste my initial thought was “what the hell?” It had a very off-putting bitterness that was not necessarily an intense hoppiness like an IIPA and it was surprising. The label states “It is quite doubtful that you have the taste of sophistication to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth,” and I was beginning to believe them! I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. I finished the first glass and slowly poured the rest of the bottle with growing dread. By now the beer had begun to warm a bit as I left it out of the refrigerator. As it warmed, Arrogant Bastard took on a much smoother more balanced taste as the malts began to balance out the hop bitterness with a more roasty almost toffee flavor. I easily finished glass #2 and completely erased my earlier disappointment. This is definitely an aggressive and sophisticated beer as the label suggests, and a very good, highly recommended introduction to Stone. Just let it warm a little first.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ThePaintedGrey,4.39,"22oz. bottle poured into a snifter.  A: Pours a rich mahogany with a light mocha colored head that's wonderfully frothy and sticky, leaving almost unbelievable amounts of lacing down the glass. Strangely, one side of the head almost completely deflated, but the other side is holding strong at a creamy 1/2"". I have to reiterate the lacing on the glass, because it is extremely beautiful to look at. This brew is gorgeous.  S: A very rigid hop profile in the nose with some roasted sweetness, bordering a lightly burnt caramel. A little bit of a citrus/fruity zest underneath.  T: The initial sip brings in a huge wave a malty sweetness and some toasted grain, but it's immediately cut down to size by a viciously satisfying rush of hop bitterness. The finish is a nice balance of sweet and bitter with a little bit of tingle from the alcohol.  M: The body isn't overly big, but it's a rich, full brew that flows along the palate smoothly. The carbonation packs a bite which, along with the tingling of the alcohol, kind of serves as a warning to take this one slow, otherwise it'll kick your ass!  O: It's almost aggravating how good Stone is because I constantly tell myself that their brews can't be all they're built up to be, but I'm always wrong, and Arrogant Bastard is no exception to that scenario. This one is every bit as refined and complex as Stone states in their arrogance.

147,92,zeledonia,3.61,"I remember trying this beer when I was first getting into beer, and finding it one-dimensional and intolerably bitter. Curious to see how it strikes me now, several years and hundreds (thousands?) of beers later. Tasted 24 March 2015.  Pours medium-dark amber, clear, with about 2 fingers of yellowish-tan head. Good retention and lacing. Nice.  Smell is warm and malty with the acid/tannic bite of a hopped-up high-ABV high-malt beer. Makes me think of an APA on overdrive. At times faintly fruity, at others very herbal. Hard to pin down, but really nice.  Taste is not intolerably bitter. I don't hate it. But I can't really say that I like it all that much. It's just too simple. Grainy, then a grating bitterness that drifts from chalky to herbal. Not a whole lot there.  Feel is okay. It comes over heavy, and could use some more carbonation to keep the flavors in motion. Disappears quick, without an obvious finishing fade or kick.  I could drink this. But I'm not compelled to. Not my cup of tea - too simple, and lacking the pleasing flavors that I want from such a beer. Give me some hop aromatics, or some malty sugars. I get neither.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,brureview,4.17,"Poured a very attractive copper tea color with a 1 F head in a Double Bastard Glass- an excellent glass for both Double and Arrogant Bastard.  The aroma changed with temps. Served colder, there was a complex blend of vanilla, lemon, and grapefruit. This fades a bit with warming when the light grapefruit begins to dominate.  The moderately carbonated mouth feel leads to the chase: the taste and finish.  Having the Double Bastard a few weeks ago in the same glass was an interesting comparison. The Arrogant Bastard is not tame- and not tamer than the DB. Rather the DB is AB on steroids. The AB has major hops and bitterness to the finish,and a strong grapefruit taste. The AB is blended differently- there are subtle layers of grapefruit and other taste elements. The DB is ""in your face"". Equally complex, but far less subtle.  Great beer.

Smells bitter, like I IPA. Sort of a grapefruit smell.  T - Initially sweet, then immediately followed with an IPA hops taste. Grapefruit and orange peel tart. After taste leaves me bitter. Even sort of soapy. Pine sap?  M - Perfect carbonation. Sort of a biscuit-y breadiness. Soapy slippery feeling to it.  O - This is a very solid brew. Although its bitterness will turn most people away underneath it seems fairly complex and special. I think if this one (since the IBU and hops type is secret) was labeled as an IPA, I would buy it regularly. Ale like it is not, at least not to my tongue. The higher IBU rating doesnt bother me, but if it was categorized differently, it may change a few people. If this is the companies Ale and its got this high of an IBU, I would be curious as to what the actual IPA they sell might taste like. Not for everyone. Not for the faint of heart.

I really love this beer and it only gets better through the years which is really rare these days.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Weston19,3.88,"A: Beer pours a dark amber with about 3 fingers worth of head. Head is a vanilla color which eventually turns into about half a pinky. This beer looks absolutely beautiful and the head retention and lacing is dead on.  S: Some pineapple, nuttiness, apple, caramel, roasted notes.  T: Caramel, major kick of hops, grapefruit, a tiny hint of sweetness like apple but hops quickly kick in and overtake. Nuttiness becomes more apparent as beer warms up.  MF: light mouth feel and a dry finish.  O: A great beer if you can handle the hops. It has a very complex set of flavors but you need to look past the bitterness to really find all the great ingredients that went into making this awesome beer. Very nice ale indeed.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,HighGravityMan,4.5,"Going at a bomber of this thing on my own after a nice Thanksgiving meal. I have been looking forward to this one since I bought it.  A - Dark red amber with a ruby red appearance through light. Nice creamy tan head about 2 fingers thick. Good retention and lacing. Honestly idgaf when it comes to appearance but it looks nice to me.  S - Mmm... subtle scents tingle my nostrils. I can smell the balance of hops and malt. Some burnt sweetness comes through. Caramel, chocolate, etc. Definitely caramel.  T - Wide range and balance here. Nice hoppy bitterness up front that evolves effortlessly into a roasted and caramel darkness. Honestly there is a lot going on here. I can't possibly get everything right but all of the flavors mesh extremely well. Noticeable alcohol adds nice warmth.  M - Thick, kinda sticky. Perfect carbonation as usual. Feels like a darker beer should.  Hot damn, I have never been disappointed by Stone. Here is another great offering and it is perfect for the cold weather coming through. Now excuse me while I finish off the rest of my 22 oz. Wish me luck!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,polloenfuego,4.12,"How does one describe this beer? It is one of the hoppiest and maltiest beers I have had in a very long time. The smell is rough hops up front, followed by some good malts. The flavor is hoppy, in your face hoppy. Then the malts come in rough but strong. Quite a unique experience. Feel is middleweight,good carbonation and a bitter lingering finish.  A classic that all folks should give a try. I think it is a polarizing beer...you will either like it, or hate it. Not sure there is much between.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The smell was mainly piney hops with some sweet malt. The taste was piney hops and sweet caramel malt with balancing bitterness. The finish was long, hoppy and bitter. The mouthfeel was good with a medium-full body and medium body.

Appearance - burgundy, swirling carbonation; very thick, foamy, orange cream colored head that never leaves! Lots of sticky lacing! Smell - citrus, pine and floral hops, some sweet candy; can slightly pick up on the alcohol. Taste - aggressive hops, mostly floral. Subtle roasted barley and caramel malts. Feel - a lot more bitterness from the hops than I was expecting...and I love it! Easy beer to drink for a hop head! Overall - a hop forward standard for the style.

147,92,freakdiablo,4.27,"A - Beautiful amber coloring, off-white head that sticks. How I expect an ale should look.  S - Milder. almost sweet smell with a little bite  T - Surprising when paired with the mild smell. Strong, bitter kick up front, hoppy aftertaste. Smooths out nicely towards the end of the bottle as it began to warm.  M - Slightly thicker, with a fair amount of carbonation  O - This beer has both surprised and spoiled me. Less hoppy than an IPA, which I like as I tend to find IPAs too hoppy, but still a strong flavor. I've only had a few bottles, but it's already one of my favorites. If I'm sampling several different beers, I try to stick AB towards the end, as many beers seem mild compared to ABs...arrogance, for lack of a better term. I'll admit, I may be new to the whole beer review thing, but even I can tell where Stone was going with this.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,GrizzleFist,2.98,"Appearance: Looked amazing, could tell it had some carbonation with the foam on top when the bottle wasn't even opened yet. Color was a nice amber.  Smell: Slight Malty smell and a little sweetness of fruit  Taste: Just a bitter taste to me. But it was bearable and wasn't too much that it became disgusting.  Mouthfeel: foamy and carbonated.  Overall: This wasn't a bad beer, but for the amount of bitterness that came with it you would expect a little more ABV to go with it. I would drink it again, just not that often.  I see now why they call it Arrogant Bastard and why most of us won't ""enjoy"" this beer. Its because its nothing special, its an okay beer, nothing more.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,USAF77,4.52,"Im having my first AB and am impressed. I cleaned a pint glass from my collection per usual and a spot free glass is worth it for this brew. Its just a gorgeous carby amber that begs to be poured slow. A rich foam head that laces very nicely. Just pouring and swirling in the light is an experience. AB is a beautiful Ale to look at.  And it smells great. Fruity hops are dry and just sharp enough. The smell doesnt jump at you either. Its subtle and takes a minute or two to soak your personal space. I must find a joint where this is on tap just to smell the air in it.  Taste wise its everything I like in an Ale. A little bitter and dry but sharp in a way that leaves your mouth wet, wanting the next sip. This is ""sipping"" ale. Anything else is criminal. A wonderful dry hoppy after taste thats using all my taste buds that still feels smooth. The rich foam head sticks around too. Wonderful!  I usually like wheats and Pilsners with my food but this is an exception. Most of all if spicey food is on the menu. This is a wonderful Ale. Im sipping it and the taste is going up thru my nasal passages from my mouth. Im increasing my rating on it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Haydn-Juby,4,"A: An amberish brown color in appearance. About a finger of tan creamy looking head.  S: A bit of hops and some nice toasty maltyness. A good amount of balance on the aroma.  T: Once again I found the beer was balanced very nicely. The malts provide a nice caramel flavor but also some darker fruits, like a bit of raisin or fig maybe. The hops are not so overly pungent as advertised but I am drinking the beer a bit past the ""Enjoy by date"". None the less west coast hops are evident and quite present just not overly so. Piney, citrusey, you get the idea.  M: Very creamy and smooth. The alcohol does not get in the way what so ever and really I wouldn't notice it if it weren't for the label on the bottle.  O: A classic of the craft origins and just a great drinking beer overall. I could easily make this an everyday beer if it was readily available.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Dope,4.18,"Best by 11/x2/13. (can't read part of it)  A: Pours a dark, almost opaque red. Big frothy tan head. Head fades slowly with top notch retention (big island of foam). Thick, fluffy tendrils of lacing.  S: Big bread crust aroma with some grapefruit and pine and maybe even a hint of grass? Probably not as fresh as it could be (see above date) but still pleasant maltiness at least.  T: Decent hoppiness up front. Nice crisp grapefruit primarily. Hints of resinous pine follow but lead into a really nice strong bread crust malt. Just a hint of raisins. A little wave of bitterness on the far side, still with some bread crusts. Crust taste is remarkably strong, really conjures up some big, stale, dried up bread crusts...in the best way possible. Lingering grapefruit between sips.  M: Medium bodied and smooth. Nice carbonation.  O: Really nice hoppy strong ale. It's not quite an IPA, not qutie an amber, something in between. Really nice hop flavor and malt flavor. Both are strong and balanced, but sharp at the same time. I'll have to get a little fresher version of this sometime, might be on the edge of starting to fade, hop-wise. Or maybe this is just really balanced.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Aaron_Ramson,4.88,"Appearance as poured into a 20 oz pint glass is stunning; a khaki head of foam that does not fall after nearly 5 minutes of sitting, a reddish brown color with absolute clarity that appears almost blood red when held to the light. Smell is very potent and powerful with equal part resiny, herbal hops and dark malts; dried fruit, prunes, leather, botanicals, pine and resin. The taste is bitter, dark and satisfying with a burnt sugar, caramel, toast, roasted cereal grains and black coffee, offset by earthy and resinous hop character, ending astringent and slightly drying. It sits heavily in the mouth, coating; medium carbonation that is completely fitting. This beer is good to the last drop, a combination of IPA, amber ale and Imperial stout in my opinion. It's a classic that has stood the test of time and one that I come back to over and over again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

T - The beer tastes great. There's a slight taste of raisins with the hoppiness. The hoppiness lingers and becomes very strong in the after taste. Almost overpowering.  M - Very smooth and good flowing  O - My only knock here is the after taste. It's very, very strong and ruins and otherwise near perfect beer.

147,92,spoony,4.15,"From a 650 ml bottle (enjoy by May 14, 2014) into a tulip.  A-A normal pour produces about two fingers of tan head. Retention is good at more than three minutes with some chunks of lacing left behind. The beer has a reddish hue and is deep amber in color. It is clear and mostly still.  S-The aroma is assertive with a big dose of orange zest, some leafy, minty green hops, some pine bitterness, but also lots of caramel and a subtle brown sugar sweetness from the malts. There is also a good bit of spice. Classic and unique.  T-The taste is definitely in-your-face, even by today's standards. Orange zest and green, leafy, minty, herbal hop notes combine with big malt flavors of caramel and toasty sweetness. The finish dries out a bit and gives just a hint of alcohol burn to go with the spice.  M-The feel is medium in heft with a smoother carbonation and a slightly oily feeling.  O-Nice to finally review one of the classic craft beers and a true American style icon. I may enjoy other beers more, but this one still drinks wonderfully (especially with pizza) and for $4 per bomber, it may have to find a more regular spot in my rotation.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Later the malt became more prominent than the initial fruitiness, but the hop bite remained quite strong. Tasty.  m: Moderate, smooth and mellow.  o: The label suggests the drinker is likely to dislike this, and if so would be unworthy of it. It's a clever ploy to put him or her on the defensive in order to encourage them to have an open mind and give it a chance to be enjoyed. It's got way more flavor than the usual popular mainstream corn and rice adjuncted lagers and pilseners, so the suggestion is this will be too shockingly different to be liked right off or ever by the average beer drinker.

The aroma was a bit of a letdown as it was very much subdued. I only caught some herbal hoppiness. The taste was sweet at first, caramel, then a mint hop explosion. Mouthfeel was a bit gritty, thick.  Overall the flavor of this beer delivers big time. I prefer this more than the Oaked version.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,Moe_Rhaun,4.35,"I've only recently been introduced to The Stone Brewing Company. That said, from the very first sip I knew I was not a typical brew. It wasn't even a typical craft brew. My initial response to a Stone Brewing Company product was ""Wow, I think this might be the best beer I've ever tasted!"". That was the Stone IPA. This is my first try of Arrogant Bastard Ale and after my taste buds stopped screaming ""Uncle!"", my response was ""Ahh, Seven Hells, that's good!!"". The first thing that caught my attention was smell. I knew then that Fate, that sultry mistress with the warm hand and sensible footwear had pushed us together and I was truly in for a treat. The rich head on this beer is the equivalent of a steak dinner at the Buckhorn Exchange. Once the beer hits your tongue it's like a cacophony of flavors. It takes your mind a few seconds to catch up with it. This beer is almost too good.

S: Light, hoppy, small citrus. Not much going on here.  T: Completely different story, here. Hops and malt both blast you in the face, more bitter than the citrus hinted at by the nose. Good if you're a fan of bitterness.  M: Smooth, slight bite, decent carbonation.  O: A very solid beer. I enjoy it, but I wouldn't drink a lot of it. Like Campari or some other bitter amaro, an occasional glass to sip is a fantastic break from the normal. However, it wouldn't be my go to on a regular basis.

The bitterness is strong, and lasts well into the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light mouthfeel, with a crisp, carbonic bite. It's the type of mouthfeel I would expect from a light lager, and it seems to thin for the taste. Alcohol warming is light.  Overall: Like a stronger, slightly less flavorful, highly carbonated porter. Well done, but not an ale that particularly peaks my interest. I was expecting more, due to its popularity.

Bitter-smoothness feels like multi-grain, and a pinch of sourness that is just right.  Mouth: Sharp and crisp toasty bread finish with a medium to heavy carbonation....not exactly perfect but just right.  Overall: As many times as i drank this I always thought I gave it a review, now five hundred plus reviews later I am giving this beer what's due.

147,92,BurlesqueRadio,4.01,"Levitation was the first brew I'd ever had from Stone (great beer-surprisingly low alcohol content, consistent on tap & yet seemingly impossible to find in the southeast) followed by Arrogant Bastard. The first time I ever tasted it was on liter night at Crowbar, a favorite local dive, although one of the worst places to try a beer for the first time.  The conditions were terrible, the carbonation on the beer mediocre (I was sloshing it around in the giant liter cups they gave us for what must have been 30 minutes before finishing it).  I felt like I needed to give the beer another chance, and I'm glad I did. Strong malt presence, strong alcohol presence, intense hops. What a perfect trio.

I was kind of surprised to see this at my local Kroger supermarket. Who'd have thought the supermarket would have any craft beer worth drinking at all? At the time of this writing, I am reviewing this as I drink. Bottoms up.  I popped the top in this bad boy and poured it into my trusty pint glass, where I got a very nice, rich, relatively clear ruby brown with a very small amount of haze (from the hops maybe?), small yet numerous carbonation bubbles rising lazily to the surface and two fingers of creamy head that takes its time to dissipate; five minutes after the pour and there's still about a finger of head, good sign. There's a lot of lacing at first, but instead of sticking to the side of the glass it slides back down into the beer. That's alright, no points off here. The immediate scent is of fruity, citrusy hops, some estery notes, a touch of grass and grapefruit; this reminds me of how a standard IPA first smells, except there's more bready malt scent. Speaking of malt, the beer smells wonderfully sweet with just a hint of a toast and some caramel that bursts through the initial hops scent. There's also a little bit of yeast (not a great deal at all, just a tiny bit) and likewise a tiny bit of alcohol buried deep in this complex bouquet of beer smell.  Taking the first sip now and all I can think is that the description on the back of the bottle did not lie at all, this is a very complex beer with a lot of depth and character. It's warmed up a few degrees and the taste follows suit with the smell, hops are the initial taste. God, I can taste those hops oils quite nicely, fruity, piney, grassy and bitter, but not overwhelmingly so. A little bit of alcohol and carbonation sting is present on the tongue after a moment, but it's not a big deal. After a few seconds there's some hops spiciness that takes its time working to the front of the palate. The flavor of the hops mellows a bit after the swallow, and the malt comes through in the aftertaste, very sweet and kind of sticky. A little bit of caramel, but not a whole lot. I'm a little bit surprised to say that the malt takes its sweet time coming to the forefront. I want to say it's smothered by the hops, but at the same time it isn't; it's simply satisfied to take a mellow backseat to the hops flavor. About a minute after swallowing the beer the malt comes through with more strength and sweetness, and the hops weaken a bit until only their most floral pine and grass notes remain, and they linger quite nicely on the tongue. A little bit longer and the biscuit and caramel flavors predominate, with just a hint of grass left. The mouthfeel is in the light-medium range, clean and a little bit oily from the hops, plus a little bit of alcohol burn. The sugar from the malt and head makes the lips a little bit sticky, no big deal really. It goes down smooth and is a joy to drink all around.  This, gentlemen (and ladies) is a damn fine beer. I have a hard time finding anything to complain about at all, and the only thing that I really didn't fully enjoy, the fact that it's not quite sweet enough, is more a matter of personal taste in my opinion. Don't be offput by this arrogant bastard, because his attitude is really more of a façade to hide the rich and decadently complex character and flavor profile beneath. I will definitely be placing Stone's beers on my to drink list.  Cheers to good health and good beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,dmgeng,4.17,"Heard lots of good things and was a pretty cheap bomber at $5.  A - Deep ruby, chestnut color. Clear with course off-white head and normal lacing.  S - Moderate aroma with hops, malt, alcohol, and some caramel tones.  T - Full flavored brew with a strong and complex flavor. It has a significant bitter hop character that hits the palate first and stays but there is also caramel, malt, raisin and alcohol. Pungent bitterness from the Chinook but with the strong maltiness and caramel flavor it doesn't hurt the tongue. I also tasted some oxidation but the enjoy by date on the bottle was only up by 2 days so could just be a fluke.  M - Very heavy mouth-feel for just a 7.2% ABV but is due to the high content of cara-malt. The carbonation also wasn't too strong so that made it seem a little heavier. There was a lingering finish with bitterness, malt, and alcohol.  Overall, a beer style that I've never tasted before. Great aroma, flavor, feel, appearance, but definitely won't be my go to or won't be my favorite brew but still drinkable. This brew is tasty, complex, and everything a big beer should be.

A- looks a reddish copper color, decent head, not bad  S- Smells like the same piney crap that is all the rage; smells like the reason I avoid IPAs  T--A lot going on. Pine up front, decent in the middle and a crappy grapefruit after taste that makes me want to stop and brush my teeth rather than take another sip  M- Taste so bad, I couldn't focus on mouthfeel  O- Interesting bottle, it worked well enough to get me to buy it.

This is gonna be good.  S: Smells really great, hoppy. Is this a double red ale? Nah it's hoppier. Smells like cedar, desert rose underneath those hops. Maybe a pinch of brown sugar.  T: Double ale at least. DAMN this brew is good, woody, bitter, VERY hoppy. I think there is a sweet fruit in here trying to hold back the tide of intensity, perhaps a lone strawberry. The balance, intensity and synergy of this ale is simply off the charts. The refined quality of this brew reminds me of when I tasted Stone Ruination Ale (for the first time) during a blind tasting. A clear winner. Is that Pinyon Pine? Do they brew these in Desert Oak barrels or am I crazy? Something different here.  M: Hops OVERLOAD (but in a good way). This ale really challenges you to take it all in. Just pummels you.  O: A balanced, refined and STRONG ale that really challenges you.

There once was a time back in my freshman year of college (2002) when I was not worthy. My Fraternity insisted on kegs of arrogant bastard and my palate was not adept to the wonderfulness that is this beer. These days all I got to say is damn I love this beer. Over the past decade I have always looked forward the to malty, burned sugar, and hoppy nose. The color is a fantastic deep red. The flavor is plenty malty, with nice caramel tones, and a nice strong bitterness. Think a Doppelbock DIPA. It's rad!

First, as a long-time reviewer with over 2,300 reviews under my belt, I have not reviewed this one until now, despite its being one of the most reviewed beers on this site. Second, I HAVE reviewed Double Bastard, which leaves me scratching my head.  From the Bottle: ""'You're Not Worthy'""; ""ar-ro-gance (ar o gans) n. The act or quality of being arrogant; haughty; undue assumption; overbearing conceit.""; ""This is an aggressive ale. You probably won't like it. It is quite doubtful that you have the taste or sophistication to be able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth. We would suggest that you stick to safer and more familiar territory - maybe something with a multi-million dollar ad campaign aimed at convincing you it's made in a little brewery, or one that implies that their tasteless fizzy yellow beverage will give you more sex appeal. Perhaps you think multi-million dollar ad campaigns make things taste better. Perhaps you're mouthing your words as you read this.""; ""At Stone Brewing, we believe that pandering to the lowest common denominator represents the height of tyranny - a virtual form of keeping the consumer barefoot and stupid. Brought forth on an unsuspecting public in 1997, Arrogant Bastard Ale openly challenged they tyrannical overlords who were brazenly attempting to keep Americans chained in the shackles of poor taste. As the progenitor of its style, Arrogant Bastard Ale has reveled in its unprecedented and uncompromising celebration of intensity. There have been many nods to Arrogant Bastard Ale ... even outright attempts to copy it ... but only one can ever embody the true nature of liquid Arrogance!""; ""Ingredients: Nothing but the finest barley, most aggressive hops, clearest water, our proprietary yeast strain and abundant arrogance.""; ""QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? If you don't like this, keep it to yourself - we don;t want to hear from any sniveling yellow-swill-drinkin' wimps, 'cause Arrogant Bastard wasn't made for you.""  Larry, the former bartender at Hemingway's in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh, used to refer to this as ""The Medicine"" because no matter how bad a day (or morning) you might be having, he believed that this would put you ""on the Recovery Trail"". Ha! He once put down an affluent customer who was waffling over Bud Light, Coors Light or Miller Lite the morning of the guy's daughter's graduation as I looked on, amused as hell, and he poured himself a draught of ""The Medicine"". Larry, this one's for you!  My pour created just over a finger of dense, foamy, tawny head that sat atop the beer in arrogant defiance of my desire to begin drinking. Color was a garnet-red with NE-quality clarity. Nose was ticklish with its inherent heat along with a toffee-like sweetness. I felt as though I might sneeze for a moment. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and the heat of the alcohol felt as though it were evaporating on my tongue. I may not be worthy of this beer! Getting past that, I began to take in flavors of anise; dried, dark fruit; caramel/toffee and an odd mintiness. Finish was dry, to the point that it was making me sweat and tear up involuntarily. I could only bow in deference to its glorious intensity. Make sure that you know what you are getting into if you open a bottle of Bastard!  OMFG! They put the Bastard in CANs! Tonight is M, 23 Sept 2019 & this is The CANQuest (tm)!  From the CAN: Samey-same as the bottle & I am short on character space. 8=(  I Crack!ed open the vent & as I listened to the hissing & carrying on from within, I could only CANtemplate my own mortality. I am an unrepentant sinner who will undoubtedly be CANsigned to the pits of Hell, but in the meantime, I beCAN a slow, gentle C-Line Glug since I was wide-awake & ready to celebrate a trivia in tonight. I got two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-tan/light brown with great retention for my efforts. Color was a Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a slightly-smoky caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel was full, thick in the mouth & on the tongue, like a dollop had been scooped into my maw. I allowed it to roll around, warming as I did so. Its intensity only increased as a result! The hops were clearly interacting with the malts to create a smoky caramel & pine AIIPA/ADIPA when they first hit the market. The sweat was running off of my forehead as I drank this iteration. The resulting lacing in the glass was CANtastic, although its removal was worrisome. It suddenly hit me - Butter Brickle ice cream! Kind of a smoky, burnt caramel & in this case, a pine-y mintiness. Mmm. Finish was dry, very boozy & not intended for the faint of heart. YMMV.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,AmishLightning,3.51,"I had this Bastard on Tap at a respectable Irish pub in Decatur, IL.  A- The color scheme for this brew had me questioning myself if I ad it right. The bottom of the glass seemed to be significantly lighter than the top of the glass. The bottom had a deep cherry red color and was quite clear. The top seemed to be almost black and a tad bit cloudy. One finger head that dissipated to thin lacing after letting it sit for a minute of two.  S-Hops was prevalent in the nose. that was the dominant scent while I felt I had some traces of caramel malts and toffee. Smell was consistent throughout the warming of the beer.  T-Hops baby, and damn was there a bunch of it. I am more of a stout and porter fellow and tonight was an exploration into the bitter world of hops. Well I had an experience. I couldn't necessary pick out any other flavors in the beer other than its overwhelming bitterness. There may have been a trace of coffee aftertaste. The bitter just sat in the back of your mouth and didn't leave, quite pronounced.  M-Hard carbonation and a nice thick beer; the kind you scoop out of the glass.  O-I had a ride on the hopsmobile.

Slightly earthy, pine, and caramel.  Taste: The hops want to be overpowering, but with the sweet malts it is extremely balanced.  Mouthfeel: A little too carbonated for my particular taste, but that's just me.  Overall: One of my favorite beers. For novice beer drinkers, it will be a little overpowering, but once you're palate starts evolving, you can't go wrong with it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Act25,4.69,"22 oz bomber poured into a Leffe Chalice. A - Beautiful mahogany, ruby, red-brown. Much darker than amber. Tan, deep, dense finger of head, which lasts and laces in a picture perfect arc around the glass. Near perfect look. Devilish color, dark but clear. S - Completely superior to every other strong ale I have tried. First, it's hoppier than malty, followed by biscuit, fruit, raisin, earth, dirt . Hints of citrus peel. Esters and alcohol as expected in 7.2% ABV. Complex meditation beer, without being strange or wobbly. T- Unlike Scottish or strong ales, there's more of a double IPA feel. Roasty maltiness first, followed by a wash of bitter hops to complete the arc. More of a strong, deep, sweet DOUBLE IPA. IPA drinkers will like this, the hop finish lingers and is powerful and leaves your mouth content. It finishes sweet, with caramel, coffee, chocolate, and toffee, and sweet grass... Which plays balance with the hop bitterness. Without any cloying or over done sweetness, tho, it's woody and nutty all the way. This is my first taste of a perfectly balanced Strong Ale. M - Medium to full bodied, well carbonated. Nicely balanced, great finish. Leaves your mouth in a great place, great finish to the evening. End on the ABA. Wet & oily from hops. O - This is a peak beer experience, 1 to take if you get banished to the moon.  PS - I have come back to ABA 3x since my review and every time it's perfectly consistent, and I've tried the oaked ABA - also great and in your face. Stone & ABA are top experiences.

Taste: Like the aromas, it has a piney bitterness, faint citrus, sweet caramel, toasty malts, some nuts and some breadiness.

Quite dry aftertaste with an insisting bitterness. Medium body with a good carbonation. Alcohol of 7.2% ABV is completely out of the picture.

Pine and resin dominate. Bitter on the finish, but balanced. Mouth watering on the finish for some time.  Medium+ body and very dry on the palate. Bold in its feel with a long aftertaste.

Also a good deal of booze smell for a 7.2% ABV.  T- Roasty maltiness composes the first phase, followed by a good deal of bitter hops to balance. Again, almost like a barley-wine, but not quite. If you took a barley-wine and mixed it with an IPA, you'd get Arrogant Bastard. It finishes noticeably sweet, with notes of caramel and toffee, taking the edge off of the booze/hoppy bitterness. There's kind of a nuttiness throughout the whole taste experience that I throughly enjoyed. This is a well balanced Strong Ale.  M - Medium bodied and perhaps just a bit too much carbonation.

The citrus becomes more evident on the nose and in the finish. Nice long finish, medium carbonation and medium body.

Up front, there's a lot of malt, notes of caramel, lot's of spice. I could really notice the spices in the aftertaste, which is delicious. Almost a light red pepper taste, very nice. As with the aroma, some cocoa and roasty flavors. Alcohol slightly noticeable when warmed. This is one of my favorite beers because like I said, there is so much going on flavor wise, but they all compliment each other so well, and nothing is out of place.

A: Very dark copper to brown, not quite clear, with a half-finger of off-white creamy head and low visible carbonation.  S: Malty, toasty sweetness, somewhat boozy, and touches of nuts and toffee.  T: Big toasty malt, significant booze, and light hop bitterness. Some booze and malt sweetness in the hang.  M: Medium body, but lighter than I expected. Alcohol quite noticeable, and more so that I expected given the relatively modest ABV. Medium carbonation sensation.  O: I am real disappointed in this one. I thought that I'd had this one before and enjoyed it; I remember enjoying the Oaked Arrogant Bastard. But this particular example - not doing it for me. Malty and boozy, and not in a good way.

147,92,Kuaff,4.58,"Ah, Arrogant Bastard. A very common craft beer, but a superb one. I poured this bomber into a snifter at cellar temperature.  The head on this bastard is a thick, two-finger, off white mass of foam which sticks around for quite a while. The color of the beer is a deep, dark transparent ruby. It looks like blood, but not quite as oqaque. Awesome.  It smells like pure hops, pine, and lemon, with a bit of caramel or honey-like sweetness.  The taste has a citric, hoppy tang, along with some sweet maltiness. Once the aftertaste kicks in, I get thorough hop flavor and bitterness. The bitterness shines through more than anything else as the ""thesis statement"" of this brew. However, there may be some other aspects in here that I can't quite identify (maybe some spices and nuttiness?). It's complex, and oh so satisfying.  This beer has a medium thickness, and a pretty lively carbonation. Feels real comfortable.  A damn solid ale available all over the place at a great price, and guaranteed not to dissapoint.

The scent is not nearly as proud but light malt and hop aromas are definitely in the mix. Subtle tea leaves and floral earthy hops are also evident.  Almost Pale Ale like taste Arrogant Bastard presents an earthy, floral array of hop flavors. Not as much on the malty or grain side this Strong Ale is pronounced in its hop flavor. The tea leaves manifest themselves and then a piney metallic aftertaste takes hold.  Overall, it's strong in appearance and hop flavor but slightly weak in aroma and overall character.

I get pine hops, spice, and some booze in the finish. NOTE: I think this beer is a bit too cold right now. I should have let it warm up a bit before reviewing.  M: Medium bodied beer. It's sticky, a bit chewy, and coating. The spice and bitters linger on the palate well after the rest of the beer is gone.  O: Very good beer.

147,92,jageraholic,4.94,"In bottle....guess it's a Stone day. Served in an IRS tulip. Best buy date of June 2nd, so it could be fresher, but I believe Stone to know when their beer will shit out by.  Appearance: very amber. Inch head with aggressive pour (yeah, on purpose). Dissapates and leaves a thin white line of head above the amber beer. Swirls magnificently, looks like a beautiful ocean wave with the bubbles floating up to the top.  Aroma: some sweet biscuit malt, but mostly piney hops with a little grapefruit in the background. I know the grapefruit is more prominent fresh.  Taste: hops. Grapefruit and pine. Followed by some malty sweetness and a finish of piney bitterness with a little citrus in the background.  Mouthfeel: thick in the mouth without filling me up. Could go back to back with this bomber. Perfect carbonation. Smooth beer but has a prickly carbonation to unbalance it which seems perfect.  Overall: Hot damn! I am worthy you bastards! I absolutely love this beer. Perfect unbalance of hops and malt. Heavy but not too heavy, could drink this all day but this will ruin a palate far more than ruination. Read the back story, what a fantasic mistake!

Hop notes are the primary components of the aroma but aren't as prominent as in an IPA -- some muted pine and grassy aromas come through.  On the other hand, the hops definitely show up in the flavor. Solid hop bitterness from start to finish, lingering for a bit afterwards. This is backed up by a solid caramel malt profile. Malt and hops do battle, with the hops winning out in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel just seems ""right"". Despite the 7.2% ABV strength, there's no boozy fuel note.

In general, I'm a big fan of Stone Brewing and my tastes have expanded to include many 'extreme' and big ales. This revisit started well enough, with an attractive red-amber ale topped by a small but durable tan head. The aroma was a slightly boozy mix of medium malt and herbal/earthy hops.

Arrogant Bastard has a taste not quite like beers I've had before... there's some bitterness in there, for sure, but it's not as intense as it seems a lot of people like to describe it. The hops in this beer mixed with the malts balance it perfectly. I've had some people try and tell me it tastes/feels ""soapy"", but I don't get that at ALL ... maybe that's because I had it on-tap. The taste is complex to the point where I can't pinpoint exactly how I remember it being, but it was interesting, and it was super tasty... a seemingly wild blend of hops and malt, and I couldn't get quite enough of my sample.

There is some roasted malts as well but overall it is the hops with some citrus that dominates.  Caramel and rich, sweet flavours with grassy hops from the smell and a lot of bitterness. There is some grapefruit coming through and a lot of sweetness. Surprisingly refreshing and had a pleasant alcohol kick to it that went down well.  Smooth with a medium to full body and a lot of carbonation. There bitterness levels were very in your face and the mouthfeel was complimented by some sweet malts too.

The hops are more of the big resiny pine notes, citrus, spice, and some herb. The malt showcases nice burnt sugar, biscuit, and caramel flavors. The finish is pretty dry, but has some nice sweetness from the caramel malt.  Overall, this is one in your face beer. SNPA made me realize that there are beers with a lot more flavor than what society would lead you to think. This was the beer that made me realize that beers could blow the roof off of your palate.

147,92,SpruceMoose,4.39,"Arrogant Bastard Ale holds a somewhat legendary status amongst drinkers. The bottle's red and white logo featuring Satan holding a stein glass shows the drinker that it's a beer best avoided by lager purists or casual drinkers alike, for the depth of flavour and character that this ale possesses really coincides with the arrogance and masculinity portrayed on the bottle. And, if the bottle's anything to go by, ""sniveling yellow-swill-drinkin' wimps"" are in for a surprising but hopefully rewarding experience with this ale.  Appearance: An aggressive pour into a dimpled DAB Dortmunder stein glass leaves a dark brown to ruby red body with generous cream-coloured head. The head retains its consistency well past the first sip and leaves moderate lacing down the glass. Overall very pleasing.  Smell: Dark cocoa aromas contrast with the scents of many intriguing hops, perhaps the most ubiquitous being citra. Not dissimilar to English IPAs yet maintaining the American craft beer charm of several kinds of hops.  Taste: The drinker is overcome with a wave of bitterness upon the first sip, with the hops gently rising as the beer remains longer in the mouth. Deep, charismatic and thoroughly enjoyable. The generous alcohol content (7.2%) is noticeable with an alcohol taste underlying the wonderful bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Just as one would expect from an American craft dark ale; moderate carbonation with a dense body, similar to many Sierra Nevada brews. Not too thin and watery, yet not too thick and bold.  Overall: This ale needn't the arrogance it flaunts on its bottle (although this undeniably adds to its character) as its deep hop aromas and aggressive bitterness give it its well-deserved status as one of the finest examples of American craft beer brilliance. The bottle claims that ""[we're] not worthy"" of drinking it, and perhaps it's right; any ale with as much character as this would have even the most seasoned beer buff worshipping it religiously.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Hendry,4.13,"Having enjoyed the Stone IPA, I was taken by the high rating displayed on a tag in front of the beer, so I thought it was worth a try. Pours like a super creamy British Brown Ale with a tall frothy tan colored whipped cream head that sticks around for an eternity.  Not getting the powerful aroma of hops in the nose as much as a malt explosion: sure, the hops are in there, you can certainly get a whiff of them amongst the caramel and bread tones that dominate.  Flavor reminds me of a highly hopped British Ale, more specifically the Landlord Strong Ale by Timothy Taylor. There is a degree of toastiness to this ale that takes center stage in the flavor, and while interesting, not exceptional.... something lacking the way my palate reacts, sort of a cough syrupy & malty toasty aftertaste that seems to be halfway to a black IPA.  A reasonable buy at $5 for the bomber, but there is a sort of rich heaviness to it that wasn't inviting me back for another sip. Worth a try?

Taste starts with toasted malts, then a hint of floral hops along with a big hit of resinous hops. Finishes with more malt along with toffee and caramel. Has a bit of an unwanted medcinally bitter aftertaste, kind of like if you let a tylenol disolve on your tongue. Flavor was great until this after taste.

POUR/APPEARANCE: An extremely clean and red shifted amber color of immediate intrigue.  OK, so first pitch showed some maturity with a clean strike.  HEAD: A quickly fading one finger pitch with loose lacing.  OK, so one in the dirt - count it up to junior jitters.  AROMA: Virtually non-existent bouquet - could be a cola for all I know.  Foul, in the dirt.  FLAVOR: The promise of oak maturity whistled into the mitt here - a sharp fast ball right down the middle takes both hitter and catcher by surprise.

I honestly saw the 22oz bottle at my local store in 2010 i think and saw the cover...hmmm this looks pretty cool maybe I should give it a shot. I don't regret it at all. Its a very complex American ale that will kick you in the butt and leave you wanting more. I have had it in the bottle as previously said. Along with a tap pour at the bar Strange Brew in Manchester, NH. All I can say is the bottle is no match for the tap by a long shot. Stronger, tastier, and I'm sure it has to be more than 7.2abv. Kind of reminds me of those old muscle cars that are rated by gross horsepower under the SAE standards at the time...but if you drove one now compared to the newer muscle cars you can definitely tell they were being modest. Anyways it has a reddish black appearance with a head that always appears no matter how you pour it. In a good way it has a mind of its own. Smellwise Arrogant Bastard has alot going on. You can smell and taste the cascade hops and other stuff I can't put my finger on. Its aggressive and complex to say the least. Tastewise like I said it kicks you in the butt and leaves you wanting more. Its very similar to an IPA but its not quite in the same category. Its very bold, aggressive, and tasty for someone looking for a rather full bodied ale. In you mouth like I said goes similar to an IPA but not quite. Its bold, full, and not as bitter as most IPA's but kicks your tastebuds almost like one. Overall the label on the bottle isn't too far from the truth. If you are more into lighter beers I'd sip or steer clear of Arrogant Bastard Ale.

147,92,Chrysostom,4.03,"As always, I review (mostly) to style (ala BJCP), modified (a bit, not too much) by personal taste (contra BJCP), or else certain beers, which are excellent exemplars of styles I do not prefer (like this IPA), would receive consistently lower marks than beers which are poor exemplars of my favourite styles.  As always, I review live, and not from notes.  My palate is accustomed to Belgian malt-bombs, and not hoppier American ales. This was one of my first craft beers ever, probably my fourth or fifth. I'm quite drunk, and, of course, my ratings are subject to change upon sobriety and/or further bottles being consumed.  Presentation: 22 fl oz bomber, $5.99, from Stone Brewing, poured in to Samuel Adam's imperial pint nonic glass (my Stone Brewery pint glass is in use by my wife), about 40ºF and warming as I write the review.  A: Crystal-clear dark, dark red or heavily burnt amber colour, bordering on the light brown. On a normal pour, three fingers of rocky, nearly off-white, head are left, which recede very slowly, leaving a heavy and rocky lacing down the sides of the glass, and never quite retreating in to something that can be called a ""crown and ring"" as opposed to a ""head"".  S: Citrus and floral hops. A tiny whiff of alcohol. I think there's a bit of bready yeast in there. It's more complex than I would have thought, but hard to describe as the hops are overwhelming. The smell is mildly reminiscent of marijuana, although not as much as the Maharaja or other ""Californian"" hopped beers. This is shaping up to be much more of an IPA than an ""American Strong Ale"".  T: Buttery yet sharp hops completely dominate the initial flavour. The mid-palate opens up to some warming, but quite smooth, alcohol (more present for 7.2% ABV than my Trappist-adjust palate is used to, but still quite good). There's a strong pull of unsweetened iced tea on the mid-palate all the way through the finish. There's a bit of caramel and strong roasted malts flavours. I don't get any sweetness at all: the hops dominate the malt in this, to my palate. Astringent. Somewhat complex: there are more flavours than I hath described. Excellent IPA. I don't know what ""American Strong Ale"" is supposed to be like. Sounds too much like an ale version of malt liquor lager.  M: Rich and smooth, with a bit of prickliness in there on the mid- and back-palates due to the carbonation.  O: I don't drink many IPAs, but of the roughly ten or twelve that I've had, this is a fine example, and a good beer in its own right. Unlike a Belgian Quad/BSDA, it doesn't become better as it warms. It's best cool/cold. As it warms, it's not bad, but not as good: Belgians get better. Not as much up my alley as my standard dark and malty Belgians, not as bitter as an absolute hop-bomb like Hop Stoopid (Lagunitas), it's worth trying if you like malty beers, as long as you don't hate hops. If you hate hops:  ""You can't handle the Bastard.""  To IPA style: 90/100 To taste: 74/100",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

S: A strange mystery alluding to the taste that is yet to come. It's hard to describe the number of smells clawing their way out of this beer, but it's safe to say that in spite of the intrigue they create, they are nothing compared to what you're about to experience. Indeed, that is the exact impression they give you.  T: A bizarre assault of bitterness and shockingly multi-layered flavor upon flavor, too many to be listed, several indescribable in modern English.  O: The Arrogant Bastard is a wonderful masterpiece of a booze that can only be enjoyed when the moon turns blue. True to the lengthy essay of a description slathered all over the back of every 22oz bottle (which wisely opens with the warning, ""you probably won't like this beer,""), it is definitively an offensive, virtually undrinkable beer. It does not go well with any known food, nor does it really suit the palette of any known human on Earth.  That being said, it is truly a work of art, a dark sorcerer in the mouth that is truly great yet terrible, something instantly beloved yet despised for its harsh hoppy character and riveting but confusing enigma of flavors. This is a strong ale to be tasted and maybe even enjoyed, but cautiously respected. Quite simply, tasting it is like having your mouth ripped to pieces. It's the sort of thing everyone should definitely try at least once, just for the experience, so they can gain the tiniest understanding of what good beer should taste like, but it strikes me as being too far ahead of its time.  tldr; This is a great and powerful booze, but BE WARNED.

Dank hops dominate the initial flavor, with sweet caramel malt coming in and fading mid palate, bowing to resinous bitterness that lingers through the finish. Grapefruit, catty hops, and pine emerge in subsequent sips, but the balance is decidedly resiny and bitter. The malt sweetness provides nice respite in later sips, along with dark fruit.  Body is on the full side, with moderate carbonation and slight alcohol warmth, with a big resiny bite.  Decidedly bitter, but balanced in extremes, to an extent.

The alcohol warms you all the way down to you belly.  O: A great, got to, aggressively hopped beer that drinks like a fresh Americanized version of an Old Ale.

147,92,rringler,4.35,"Ah, my good friend; it's finally time to give you a review.  A: Very clear light cola color, with one and a half fingers of creamy, beige head. The head is made up of medium sized bubbles, that retain pretty well and lace the glass nicely.  S: A bit of fruit rinds, sweet malts, and grassy hops. The malts smell big, and foreshadow what's to come.  T: Interesting taste; mildly bitter fruit start, then a thick, moderately sweet malt mid-body, and then transitions to a strong hop finish. Tastes moderately boozy for 7.2% abv, though there are worse offenders.  M: A little thicker, heavier, and oilier than your run of the mill IPA. Carbonation is good though.  O: Probably an acquired taste. I live in SD, so me and Stone are bffs. That said, while I think everyone should try this beer, I don't expect everyone to love it immediately. It takes some time before the gargoyle gets you.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,themind,4.21,An easy to attain quality brew that deserves its high rating. Every once in a while I will pick up a bomber and it reminds me how good this beer is.

147,92,GreesyFizeek,3.32,"On tap at MacGregor's on East Avenue in Rochester, NY.  Pours a dark amber color, with a one inch head, and some good lacing down the glass.  Smells like toasted bread, caramel, and blistering hops. I can tell this one will be intense.  I guess I'm not worthy, this is just too much of everything for me. Astringent, unpleasant grapefruit rind bitterness lingers on the palate forever. Lots of malt too, like burnt bread. A lot of alcohol burn too, this is just way too intense to be enjoyable.

147,92,MisSigsFan,4.22,"Honestly, when I first tried this beer, I thought I wasn't ""worthy."" It wasn't until the second time I had it I realized how truly amazing this ale actually is. At first I was sort of off put by the sheer bitterness that this beer has, but after overcoming that aspect, I absolutely fell in love. With an IBU that's said to be over 100 (Stone says the real IBU is ""classified"") it can be quite intimidating, especially after reading the blurb on the back of the bottle. That said, I am just blown away by how good this is. It pours a beautiful darkish red color with a bone white head. The pine and sting of the hops is immediately noticeable as you pour. Even more noticeable as you drink with a hint of sweetness behind it along with malt and a bit of roast as well. The mouth is surprisingly smooth with low carbonation. It almost clings to your taste buds, leaving you with a lingering bitterness. This is quite a special and unique ale. I'm glad to say that I'm from the same city where this beast was conceived. I just bought a four pack of the Oaked ABA and eagerly await to try it. Review will follow.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Taste: caramel malt with bitterness and pine from the hops. Some roasty notes as well. Strong presence of both malts and hops, with a nice balance achieved between them.  Mouth Feel: smooth and heavy. Low carbonation. This ale coats the tongue and mouth, and thus the taste lingers for a while.  Overall: damned delicious!

Also, picked up a little roasted malts. Aroma is much lighter then I thought it would be.  Taste: Piney, grapefruit, some earthiness and citrus. Bit floral and spicy. Caramel malts along with roasted and/or burnt malts. Malts seem a bit dominate but hops are strong and plentiful.  Mouthfeel: Median-heavy with median carbonation. A little sticky. A touch dry in the finish. There is definitely bitterness that lingers. Goes down smooth.  Overall: I kinda had a high expectation for this beer. One thing I really like was the malts in this beer.

Some roasted malt sweetness in the background.  The flavor is more to the malt side than the aroma would suggest. There's an upfront dark, burnt sugar flavor along with roasted grains and slight alcohol. Some hop flavor in the finish, along with plenty of bitterness.  A medium bodied beer. Smooth, with delicate carbonation. A wet, yet bitter finish.  A great beer.

T- A big smack of earthy, spicy, and piney hops hits up front, some malty caramel sweetness balances, but the bitterness hits hard on the end and lingers well after the sip.

147,92,Darkmagus82,4.21,"Served on tap in a snifter glass  Appearance-Served a mahogany colored brew with ruby highlights shining throughout. Upon serving there is a one finger cream colored head that fades rather quickly to leave a persistent film on the top of the brew and a very nice level of lace on the sides of the glass.  Smell – The aroma is a nice mix of bready malts, caramel, and a moderate hop aroma. The hop while mainly grapefruit citrus in nature is also mixed with aromas of a pine hop aroma as well.  Taste – The taste begins with a bready and biscuit base with a lighter caramel sweetness. Up front there are also some hop flavors of a pine nature. The caramel fades as the taste advanced with the pine getting stronger and more potent. While the caramel fades, fruit flavors of a light cherry and apple flavor come to the tongue. While the pine levels out in the middle, it is joined by a lighter grapefruit citrus hop flavor. This citrus grows stronger more toward the end of the taste with it, when mixed with the rest of the flavors, leaving a bitter pine and citrus flavor to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel-The body of the beer is on the slightly creamier side with a carbonation level that is a b it on the higher side. The creaminess allows all the hop flavors of the brew a chance to linger on the tongue, while the carbonation level makes it easier drinking and more refreshing.  Overall – A quite tasty brew. It’s on the hoppier side, but balanced quite nicely by the sweeter fruit, caramel, and more malty flavors of the brew. Its well know for a good reason; its quite a good moderate strength IPA.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Some malty and chocolate notes. Can't pick up too much of the hops.  T: Hop explosion followed by baking chocolate, espresso, prunes and an aftertaste of chocolate milk. Alcohol is never apparent except to dry the finish nicely.  M: Rich and satisfying but never syrupy.  O: Even if I hated this beer I would give it points for the monologue on the bottle.

The head recessed with beautiful mounds leaving a medium tracing behind. Had a medium aroma that gave to a surprisingly strong hop taste that left a medium amount of bitterness on the palate. Mouth feel was medium with an almost light chewiness to it, all together I found it to be a delightful beer for any afternoon.

147,92,flayedandskinned,4.08,"Best by 10/8/13 (so by Stone's freshness plan, this was bottled on 7/8/13) Poured into a standard tulip glass.  Appearance: (4.5) Pours an absolutely gorgeous, transparent dark amber that has some lovely ruby red highlights. A tight bubbled, light beige, 3 fingers tall head quickly forms and has awesome retention.As the head slowly recedes, it leaves some thick, sticky lacing in it's wake.  Aroma: (4) Spicy Chinook hops leap out of the glass as you raise the glass to your nose; resinous pine, grapefruit and some lemon zest. There is a slightly roasty, chocolate malt presence lingering in the back ground with a slight nuttiness to it. Faintly sweet biscuit malt is behind the chocolate. Subtle alcohol presence.  Taste: (4) Very similar to the nose; Spicy Chinook hops right upfront with their strong herbal spiciness, pine resin and bright grapefruit. Beneath the spicy hops there is a slightly chewy malt backbone; Lightly sweet chocolate with a distinct, subtle nuttiness about it. Finishes off dry, with some residual sweetness on the corners of mouth that really helps take some of the ""sting"" out of the assertive and very bitter Chinook hops. Lingering notes of pine, grapefruit pith and an airy-like biscuit presence. A light alcohol presence makes itself known as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: (4) Robust, full bodied with some moderate carbonation to help lift the heavy crystal malts off of your tongue.  Overall: (4.25) The notorious beer that invented the ""American Strong Ale"" category and also introduced a whole lot of people to the true art of craft beer. While this certainly isn't the best American Strong Ale I've had, (Stone's Lucky Bastard takes that honer, which is actually a blend of all 3 Arrogant Bastard variants) this is a landmark beer that can be enjoy both by the craft beer neophyte and the most seasoned craft beer enthusiast.

147,92,TheCondor,4.46,"In my continuing quest to imbibe all the Beers of Fame, I consumed some Arrogant Bastard Ale. THe last Stone product I drank was Ruination, which was way too much for me. It kind of soured me on Stone products for a while. Side poured with vigor from the bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance- Pours a beautiful clear brown color with a big, fluffy, rock to finger head that disspiates very slowly, still retaining much of the head down to the last drop. Excellent lacing as well, leaves tons of residue all down the glass. Fabulous presentation  Smell - Smells so unique, especially given its appearance. Breads, toasty malts, and aggressive hop characteristics such as pine, citrus, and grapefruit collide in the nose of this brew. So unique, I hardly know how to charaterize this brew!  Taste - Outstanding, one of the best tasting beers I have had for a while. Strong hop notes up front such as citrus and pine give way to the malty, bready backbone. As the brew warms, there is a bit of dried fruit flavor as well.  Mouthfeel - Finishes crisp and bitter, like an IPA. Letting this beer warm only makes it more refreshing and drinkable. This is truly an exceptional brew.  Overall - One of the the best beers I have ever had, and I've drank quite a bit of beer in my day. Warm or cold, this beer is outstanding. I was taken aback by the beer that poured like a brown or amber ale, smelled like an IPA, and tasted like, well, nothing I've ever really had. It is a true conglomeration of styles.

Fantastic brew from a fantastic brewery.  A: pours a rich rust/amber color with a thick head that lasted for a minute or two with substantial lacing.  S: initial aroma after opening and pouring were notes of toast, caramel and butter scotch and aggressive hops/pine. After it has sat and opened up, nuances of dried fruit like mango, prune and apricot are noticed.  T: explodes with flavor! They weren't lying when they said this is an aggressive beer. It's been about 5 minutes since I took a sip and I can still taste the hops. But at the same time, it doesn't scare me away with the hops and bitterness and dry finish. It makes me want to drink more. Very dark chocolate is there after sitting for a few minutes, as well as burnt sugar adding to the dry, bitter flavors.  M: rich flavor and very dry and long finish.

Pours a big fat, two fingered head that hangs around like your wife's annoying friend...only...in a good way. You could almost serve this head in a dish with an ice-cream scoop.  Smells like a grapefruit fruit and a pine cone had an illegitamate love child in the form of a good beer. Kind of reminds me of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale in the aroma department.  The taste was a big shock to me as it wasn't nearly as hoppy and bitter as it smelled. It does have the grapefruit hoppy taste of a pale ale, but it's not overpowering which is what I was afraid of.

Appearance - 2-3 fingers of nice, thick head; dark brown in color; head subsided over time as I drank it but left brilliant traces of lace down the sides of the glass. Great looking beer...  Smell - Citrus fruity smell, caramel, extremely aromatic; can smell the hops; incredible smelling beer.  Taste - Wow...initial reaction is, ""wow, this beer is hoppy."" Then I began to taste the incredible citrus taste, a hint of coffee, caramel, and malts. Incredible beer by the second sip; almost rind-like in it's taste. Very complex tasting beer....one of the most complex beers that I have ever tasted.  Mouthfeel - Very hoppy; bitter hops tend to linger slightly in your mouth and throat but this subsided as the beer warmed and I made my way through it.  Overall - In short, not for the faint of heart! Complex, intense, mildly overwhelming, with a sharp bite. However, extremely enjoyable; well-crafted; aromatic, full-bodied; delicious.

First poured hard into a pint bar glass from 22 oz bottle, this brew was a dark mahogany brown in color and produced 3 fingers of a dense light brownish head that lasted more than a few sips leaving thick lacing on the glass. ABV on the bottle at 7.2%.  After warming a bit the aroma was dominated by both the malts and hops which from my experience was unusual as normally it is either one or the other. Some caramel and coffee hints were also noticeable.  The flavor profile was hop dominated and spicy along with a somewhat sweet wealth of caramel and toasted malts. It possesses a lengthy finish with tones of malty sweetness, caramel, and roasted coffee beans as well as palate cleansing hop bitterness. It is very well balanced, complex and a treat for the tongue.  With good body and light carbonation, and the hop spiciness perfectly balanced by the malty sweetness, the mouth feel is well above my average for strong ales I have tried.  Overall what can I say. Perhaps that perspective is a good thing. As one who “came of age” in the 50’s/60’s, and eagerly sampled the readily available US beers of that period, this beer makes me very happy. Those who have “come of age” since the 1980’s cannot fully appreciate the dramatic difference between the readily available beers I naively quaffed in my 20’s and 30’s and what is available today. And breweries like Stone are the leaders in providing such a drastic difference between then and now. They are paving the future of beer by expanding the envelope beyond what we so eagerly enjoy today.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Mikecap,4.65,"This was one of my first forays into the aggressive hop-foward west coast beers, and I have never looked back.  Pours a deep brown color, almost black in appearance with a slight whitish head.  The smell recalls citrus notes with pine and maybe even some oak in there, the hops are certainly at the forefront and Stone makes no attempt to hide that.  Powerful malt and hop flavors dominate the brew, bitter without being too bitter, plus some sweet notes of citrus and caramel. Absolutely delicious.  Certainly a bold mouthfeel that captures the essence of the style. Although classified as a strong ale, I put it more towards Black IPA on the spectrum thanks to the hops and intensive, but smooth finish.  Overall one of my favorite beers out there, and a true product of the fine men at Stone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,lordofstarside,4.3,"One of the beers that got me into craft beers, only now getting around to reviewing it. Bomber to snifter, best by 1/20/13  Pours a dark brown ruby with a finger of caramel tinged foam. Moderate carbonation with good lacing and retention. Aroma of hops, caramel, some citrus, toffee, a bit of alcohol and some sugar with a good sweet malty back. Taste of spicy hop, caramel malts, and some butterscotch. Sweet malts come through with a strong finish tying the beer together. Mouth is full bodied, good carbonation with a nice sticky finish.

147,92,arfenhouse,4.36,"A: Very big head and very good lacing. Dark amber with off-white lacing.  S: Smells like an IPA hiding behind a brown ale. Brown sugar and grapefruit.  T: Really follows the smell. Good brown ale characteristics. Caramel, brown sugar, toasted grain/bread,, skunkiness. Very hop forward flavor that resembles their IPA. Grapefruit all the way.

147,92,mfnmbvp,3.92,"22 oz. bottle, no bottled on date present.  A - Beautiful dark ruby brown color, I poured the beer like sh*t and ended up with a giant three finger head, but I'm not going to complain too bad since the first glass I had was a nice half finger head, and I got a lot of lacing on the glass.  S - Wonderful roasted malts and a nice bitter hop presence in the nose. I love it.  T - The taste is almost just as pleasant as the smell, nice bitter hop kick to it amidst some roasted malt flavors.  M - Nice mouthfeel, not too carbonated, and the bitter hops linger in the back of your throat for a minute. I almost enjoy this ale as much as I enjoy certain IPA's.  Overall, a wonderful beer from Stone Brewery, who mostly never ceases to delight me. While I am a big fan of their Stone IPA and their Ruination IPA as well, the Arrogant Bastard Ale probably stands out for me as their landmark beer. I love it, but I try not to drink it too often so that it remains a pleasant treat. A must have beer.

S -Roasted grain, pine, citrus, maple syrup and light floral. Not real strong.  T - Caramel, burnt-toast, roasted grain, grapefruit zest gives significant bitternes; more than the oak-aged.

147,92,jucifer1818,1.81,"NOTE: I am very, very biased against this kind of beer. you have been warned  appearance: looks good, 4/5  smell: overwhelming hops flow from this one, pleasant I suppose, but its just a mild warning for whats coming in the taste. 3/5  taste: Remarkably un-balanced despite its stronger alcohol content. overwhelming hoppyness. so overwhelming that it becomes remarkably hard to drink  I have to choke this one down, and its almost as hard for me to drink as a ruined batch of beer, hobo wine, and malt liqour, so I will rate it as such 1/5 (if you are not me and LIKE that kind of burn, then I suppose give it a 5/5 for taste)  mouthfeel: I cant tell. the hops stung too much to notice Average I suppose  Overall: I hate this beer. I really really do.  I know that it wasn't made for me. it was made for hopheads but I am not a hophead I give this one a 1/5  if you love hops, I suppose its worth a 4/5 however, if you want balance to your beer and greater character from the malt, look elsewhere.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Danny1217,4,"Pours a deep amber with an off white head that has some nice retention. Lots of nice lacing left behind. Smells extremely hoppy and somewhat sweet. Lots of caramel, citrus and earthy scents. Slightly nutty. Extremely hoppy taste as well, balanced with some caramel like sweetness. Roasted nuts, citrus, caramel. Some complex flavors here. Very bitter bite on the end. Dry. Harsh, but not overly so. Medium body and carbonation.  Arrogantly overhopped and flavored. This beer packs a ton of flavor at only 7.2% ABV. Very good.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,KKB,4.6,"A – A gorgeous deep copper/ caramel with a tight-bubbled light beige head. A good looking beer, it starts leaving lacing around the edges from the get go as the head recedes.  S – Am I worthy? If ever a head could smell intimidating this is it: Over-hopped, ridiculous amounts of malt—arrogant indeed. The smell contains sharp, citrus hops as well as a concrete malt overtone that probably should clash, but doesn’t…at all. One of the best noses out there, IMO.  T – It’s a meal, you know? It’s an experience, it’s a delight, a lark, a song, an adventure. The taste is just so bold, and in a way typifies Stone brewery in my opinion. This beer should be an overwrought undertaking—it’s too much—so many hops, so much malt, so much character, it ought to overwhelm. And yet it does not, it is simply… great. One of the best things out there. Beautifully sweet and caramel-esque from the malty goodness, powerfully bitter and floral from the huge hoppy content, and these two super powers balance one another out. It’s very impressive, it’s very good—I see where the arrogance stems from.  M – The mouthfeel is just like this strong ale, it is bold, it is concrete, but it is just right for this beer. It has a medium body, very light carbonation with a bitterness on the palate due to the hops  O – This aint my first rodayo kid, I’ve been drinking his arrogance for a minute now. And I must say, that this is one of my favorite brews, from one of my favorite breweries on the planet. It is not nearly as intimidating as you may think it is, it just has so much flavor, and it is beautiful thing. Go beer, go, stone, go arrogance. DELICIOUS!  Ps. Ignore the 4 for the overall. I am only giving it that to balance it out to the score that I think this beer deserves. A 4.63 is utterly appropriate, and I think I gave each of the categories an accurate score, but with the overall being 4.5 the score for the beer was somewhat too high, so I lowered the overall.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jaz58,4.33,Enjoyed this brew at Jerome Bettis Grille in Pittsburgh  Pekoe Tea in colour.  A nice thin head that stayed thoroughout the drink creating a nice lace spider web.  Hints of toffee in the noise.  Tea with a hint of qunine at the beginning. The bitters come in and they are aggressive yet not overwhelming.

I'm not a huge fan of hops , So it was all I could do to hold my nose and choke down this beer I paid $7 dollars for. But if you are a fan of bitter tasting hop flavored beers give this a go.

147,92,BeerDocT,4.05,"Served in a chilled tulip glass.  -Appearance 3.5: Poured out a dark, opaque brown. 1/2"", cream-colored head quickly faded leaving spotty swirls. Lots of CO2 little bubbles abound.  -Smell 3.5: Subdued bouquet, but I do detect lots of grapefruity hops and a slight hint of barley.  -Taste 4.5: Front is slightly sweet and alkaline dry, then the middle kicks in and hits you with sweet barley tones like a delicious wave of LME, but this is balanced by a HUGE hop kick in the back of the mouth. Wow! Finish is restrained: more hops, but more dry than the middle. Finish is all alkaline hops and is strangely smooth. Really amazing flavor profile in this beer.  -Mouthfeel 4.0: Carbonation is complementary to the enjoyment of this beer.  -Overall 4.0: Excellent tasting beer and that's all that matters to me. If I ever find this on tap, I will not hesitate to order a pint. This beer has a really unique flavor profile and I will definitely be buying this brew again.

147,92,ScaryEd,3.52,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass.  Pours a clear, deep mahogany color with at least 2 fingers of creamy khaki head. The retention is absurd; just sitting there, judging. Waiting. The head leaves a sticky ring of cobwebs around the top of the glass, before ultimately settling into a thick blanket of foam.  The aroma, unfortunately, belays the name of the beer. It's actually quite restrained. More shy than arrogant. Lots of sharp, piney hops resonate through the nostrils before a wave of caramel malt. Floral. Toasted. Just need more.  The flavor brings out citrus notes; namely grapefruit, before a wave of caramel, and roasted nuts. Then comes an assertive punch of bitter, piney hops, leaving the palate coated in sticky, resinous earth.  The feel is medium bodied and well-carbonated. Sticky, syrupy, with a lingering bitterness. Some modest warmth from the alcohol.  Overall, a pretty good beer, albeit one I've always found maddeningly disappointing. Everything from the name, to the label, to the description, just screams arrogance. It says ""this is an f'ng beer"". But tasting it, smelling it...it brings restraint. Still, for the price this is a beer that's hard to pass up.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,BigBarley,4.27,"A - Poured into a pilsner glass, rich, deep amber color with a finger head that maintains for a long time. This beer looks flavorful, with a deep color that gets much more clear and closer to an orange when held up to the light. Somehow it can be dark and light at the same time, which to me says powerful stuff.  S - Smells very balanced, the nose hits hard with a hop presence and a malt sweetness all at once. Very faint hints of caramel and something almost sour smelling that hide below a heavy hop profile.  T - Strong ale indeed! This is one hell of a beer, touching on all sorts of flavors. As is the case with many Stone brews, the hops seem to dominate, but there are hints of a biscuit taste, a minor touch of dark chocolate, a note of caramel, all seemingly wrapped in a hoppy bitterness that attacks the tongue. This is not a beer for a standard beer drinker. Extemely flavorful.  M - I feel this beer would be a better fit with a thicker body, but the carbonation is nice, and it does go down smooth. Not too thin, just lacking a really ALE-worthy construction. Luckily the mouthfeel is not my primary attraction.  O - A great beer for seasoned craft drinkers. Heavily recommended to hop heads who want more than another IPA. All around flavorful and satisfying beer. I personally feel that Stone has better beers out there, but this one has plenty of merit, and stands above most beers as a truly strong ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The head was pretty thick at 3/4 of an inch from bottle to glass and the lacing was above average, leaving lacing 2-3 inches high.  The smell is nice. Heavy, earthy, nutty tones mixed with a nice sweet smell.  The taste is distinct and subtle at the same time. Like the smell, the taste is dominated by a nutty flavor followed quickly with a sweet, malty taste. The malt flavor tastes like brown sugar. There is a hint of spices in the aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is smooth, mainly from the sweet malt and then dry from the spices at the end. The spices are difficult to identify...  Overall this beer is a solid ale. 7.2% ABV is masked well by the sweetness of the brew but you can still taste the alcohol in the beer.

147,92,AmitC,4.38,"Wow a 5.99buck 22 oz bomber. I have high expectations because of Stone name and its price.  Pours with a very little head. Less than a finger thick. Ruby amber color. On the darker side of strong ales. Not a lot of reddish hue. But still something a lot discernible. Leaves some lacing on the glass, not absolutely mesmerizing but yes it is decent. Clear and transparent. A good amount of bubbles rising from everywhere.  Smell is a lot complex. Initial impressions of mildly roasted malt, more sweetness and caramel. Some mix of hops, that is at times resinous/piney and at times little citrus. But you have to really search for it. You have to sniff it out. Nose creates an anticipation of a much sweeter ale.  Than it actually is. Gets into my palate with a lot more bitterness than what nose gives. Nowhere near that of an IPA but still a good amount of burning sensation when it passes through the throat. That is something i appreciate here. Sweetness is there, in abundance, however it just makes the aftertaste of bitter hops go away. Nothing more. Otherwise, it is very strong on the alpha hops, for a strong ale.  Feels a lot oily when pouring. However, it is not that much oily. Resinous effect is certainly there. Body is a lot fuller and makes a punch along with bitterness. Medium carbonation helps a lot. Drink-ability is medium. A bomber is enough for a session.  Excellent brew. Reminds you of red and strong ales until it goes in. And once it enters the mouth, it gives more of a mild IPA feel.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

From there it went south for me. I don't want to totally dog the beer like most people do with the macro beers (which aren't all that bad); but I just cannot rate the taste for this very highly.  I'm sure most people will disagree with me, but I had to pour out most of this pint. The head hadn't even dissipated before my stomach started to hurt.

147,92,StoutishDan,4.63,"Picked this brew up at Trader Joe's for only $4.50. Elsewhere I had seen it for much more than my wife would prefer me spending.  22 oz bottle poured into one of my Brooklyn Brewery Pint glass.  A - Holy mother of the beer gods, this one is beautiful! Darker than I expected. Deep, rich mahogany color. Decent head, but very sticky lacing. It's leaving nice rings after each sip just how I like it. Looks beautiful!  S - Piney and spicy hops. Very complex. Sweet and spicy maltiness. Carmel-brown sugar smell going on. Can't pend too much time simply sniffing this beer. It begs to be tasted.  T - Bitter hops. So nice, though! Very hoppy Strong Ale. It has all the right qualities you'd expect from Stone. Bold hoppiness up front and through the mid pallet 'experience' followed up with a sweet roasty carmel malt at the end, right before a flood of that sam bitterness - the roastiness sticks around.  O - Has to be one of my new favorite beers. I like the roasty flavors at the finish. My ranking out of 100 is a solid 99. Do they have six packs of this beer? Please! The 22 oz are too small.  I'm not sure if this is the case with other reviewers - and I mean no disrespect by comparing such a phenomenal beer with another brewery, but I found Arrogant Bastard to be a bolder version of New Belgium's Fall Seasonal Red Hoptober.

There is an underlying pine tree aroma which comes through the malt sweetness at times but the nose is full of complex sugary sweetness  T: Round malt notes, heralded by the nose, of toffee, brown sugar, caramel and mocha espresso. The sweetness quickly transitions to a leafy, piney bitterness with intertwining citrus zest. Good warming alcohol which is well balanced between the malt and hops.  M: Chewy, smooth, and oily linger all topped off with a moderate amount of zesty carbonation.

The head is slightly off white and really doesnt stick around too long. The nose is mostly pine, herbal and floral hops. The taste of this beer starts out with a high bitterness and an intense hop profile. There is a ton of grassy, herbal, spicy notes and a lot of pine and some lemon zest.

Pours out a hazy brownish amber with three fingers of sand colored head that lasts for about four minutes and leaves behind some pretty nice lacing patterns on the glass. Medium body and carbonation levels, somewhat crisp texture in the finish.  Smells of piney / citrus hopping combined with toasted / caramel malts in aggressive quantities. Gains a touch of cherry aroma as it warms up. Flavor follows suit, but also has a woody and brash herbal hopping aspect that creeps up on you. It is slightly out of balance in favor of the hops (on purpose) but that's sort of the target they were aiming for. For me, this feels like a nice return to aggressive beers that comforts me whenever I'm in the mood for something 'aggressive yet not completely over the top crazy"".",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,tectactoe,4.09,"They always have Arrogant Bastard on tap at a pub close to my house. Pours a deep ruby shade of brown with a thin head that leaves tremendous lacing. I've found that many of Stone's brews leave awesome lacing, and this one is certainly no exception. The initial whiff has a floral essence with plenty of hops and flowers, which is quickly followed up by a nice helping of toasted malts and grains. The taste has pronounced bitterness from the hops up front that quickly becomes mellowed out and balanced by a deep, sweet caramel flavor with roasted barley and a hint of earthy and coffee flavors. The bitterness is nearly a whim by the end, but clearly leaves an impression on your tongue, teasing you to drink more. The mouth is somewhat thick, very smooth, and a bit creamy.  This beer contains a solid amount of malt flavor as well as hop flavor and does an incredibly nice job of balancing the two in near perfect harmony - one of the hardest tasks when making beer. This is a beer that I have had many times, and I'm sure many more times to come.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,JamesMN,4.23,"Appearance: Deep mahogany brew with great clarity. Foamy off-white head (almost light sand colored). Lacing seems imminent.  Aroma: Classic Stone grain bill for a hoppy beer. Light caramel malt and some slight sweet notes from the hops. Really not a big aroma here but nothing bad.  Taste: Really great bitterness that never relents. At first it's all you can taste. The hop character is piny and a little earthy but delivers big time on bitterness (probably between 100 and 120 IBUs), which is excellent for a hop head like myself. Once you get past the bruising effect on your palate, the malts come out nicely and give the hops something to stand on. Caramel (almost toffee) malt profiles emerge and do a wonderful job of balancing everything. The finish is smooth and the lingering bitterness on your palate makes sure that you won't soon forget what you just drank.  Mouthfeel: A bit above medium bodied with a good level of carbonation. Surprisingly above average to high drinkability.  Final Thoughts: Stone never disappoints me. The reputation of Arrogant Bastard and their whole line up is well deserved. A great beer that separates the men from the boys (well the macro drinkers from the craft beer consumers at least). Would I drink it again? Yes.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I gave myself a generous first pour, but I was really captured by the look.  S - good. Lots of citrus and some hop character. Not too sweet or sour.  T - also good. I tasted quite a bit of woody flavor here, not the sweetness or citrus I thought I would. The alcohol content, although low, played a role, but it wasn't intense by any means.  M - this beer was definitely quaffable. I enjoyed the sharp character the semi-carbonation gave it, but it was also smooth and drinkable.

It's quite a bitch slap on your tongue. Strong Ale is the best way to describe it. It's just so strong on your tongue - bitter and complex. I honestly can't pick apart the pieces that make up this beer. The malt and hops work together seemlessly for a balanced taste. I've never tasted sweetness in this beer, though, which some have noted in their reviews.

Poured a beautiful light reddish color with maybe a finger or less of white head. I've never had a strong ale before..so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. This beer was delicious...nice deep malt sweetness almost a cherry flavor, balanced by a good kick of hop bitterness on the finish. Nice amount of carbonation, and left an absolutely fantastic lacing on the glass..perhaps the best I've seen.  If a pompous male cherry and female grapefruit got together for a night of intense passion and produced a love child made of beer, and the cherry skipped town the next day, the grapefruit would have named her baby Arrogant.

147,92,steveh,3.73,"Okay, everyone's had it but me -- time to remedy that. Never heard of an American Strong Ale, guess I'll just have to judge somewhere between an Old Ale and a Barleywine.  A -- Poured into my Rodenbach snifter: Clear, deep cherry reddish with a dense, light tan head.  S -- Estery fruitiness -- peach-like, caramel malts back, no hops. Light peppery alcohol in the finish. Earthiness with warming.  T -- Rich, chewy caramel maltiness up front that blends into a very spicy, resinous hop flavor. Dried fruit characters in between; not quite vinous -- very smooth. Some cardboard-like oxidation at the finish along with toasted bread characters. Aftertaste is a mellow balance of the toastiness and spicy, resinous -- almost vegetal hops. Some leathery, woody characters with warming.  M -- Mouthfeel is surprisingly crisp and rather spritzy with a medium to light-heavy body.  O -- A decent strong ale. More akin to an Old Ale than anything, but drier than I look for.

S-A bit lack luster for both stone and especially one aptly named ""arrogant bastard"". You can smell the cherry and earthly oak elements, but the strong is not as intoxicating as I may have liked. That being said I have had bastard previously to writing a review, so knowing the nose did not live up to the massive taste may leave me a bit biased.  M-Perfection. This is ideally how a beer should feel. Thick enough to coat the palate and fill your mouth, but still surprisingly carbonated, making it much crisper and more refreshing than I would have expected. The feel cuts the huge taste just enough to make the beer slightly smoother than it would have been, which proves to make all the difference.  T-Huge astounding flavors that do not quit long after you have swallowed the sip. A harsh woodsy flavor is immediately introduced, that is cut by the sweetness of the cherry and citrus.

147,92,falloutsnow,3.75,"From: Binny's in Champaign, IL Date: None listed Glass: New Belgium Globe  Stone's Arrogant Bastard is a hearty, malt-forward brew (at least on this tasting; I remember it being more hop-forward before?) that focuses on robust, caramel-like malt with a hint of roast alongside grapefruit-like bitter hops. Generally enjoyable, but I'm hoping this was an old bottle, meaning I need to retry this, as the first bottle I had was interesting with its hops and definitely superb to what I'm rating now.  Pours a 2cm, light tan head of small (bottom) and large (top) bubbles with fairly poor retention. While retention is mediocre, the head leaves good amounts of lacing along sides of glass, eventually reducing to a thin lacing atop the entire body. Body is transparent dark amber brown, with light making the tones lighter and bringing out a reddish tint. Carbonation is readily visible along sides and middle of glass.  Aroma is robust, of fairly heavy brown and caramel malts, soil, wood barrels, slightly bitter and pine-like hops, and a bit of ethanol.  Opens with significant amounts of caramel-like malt sweetness, transitioning to a fairly substantial grapefruit-like hop bitterness with thick malt undertones by mid-palate. Back of the palate brings out some mild roasted malt flavors along with continued hop bitterness and mild ethanol. Aftertaste is of lingering hop bitterness alongside caramel-like malt sweetness. I recall this having a substantial amount more hop flavor, particularly interesting tropical fruit flavors. I wonder if this is an older bottle, well past its prime.  Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied, with mid-level carbonation that is able to create a somewhat foamy, smooth mouthfeel. Closes out expectedly dry.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Good random sticky lacing. The beer smells woody, and of alcohol. But it's a nice warm oak aroma, maybe some caramel malts in their too. Taste is a combination of caramel sweet malts and burnt hop oak wood. The finish leaves sweetness and hop bitterness. There's balance here. The mouthfeel is dry and slightly heavy, a wee bit of an alcohol presence.  Overall, a nice sipper, for sure. I'm not really familiar with the style, so this didn't strike any emotion in me.

147,92,rickyleepotts,4.37,"I have had this beer before, but I don’t remember what it tastes like. After reading how this beer got started, I can’t wait to drink it. I LOVE a good hoppy beer, and while this one was once thought too hoppy, I am glad they decided to bottle it. I also like the story behind it… with one co-founder thinking it was horrible and the other thinking it was the best beer he had ever had. It was also fun to learn that this beer is the most sold in 22 ounce bottles. It must be good!  In the Glass: It is darker than I expected. I guess reading about how hoppy it is, I expected it to be the color of a typical IPA. I guess with the label and the name, it is anything but typical. I am a big fan of Stone, and pretty much every beer they make is loaded with aroma and flavor and always satisfies.  Nose: Imagine taking a bag of wet hops, letting them set outside, and then thrown into a bottle. Holy crap, this beer smells amazing. It doesn’t smell like hops, rather wet, dirty, rotten hops. But that’s OK. I like hops regardless of the aroma. On a second sniff I am getting more dark fruit notes and a little fig at the finish.  Flavor: Holy hops. This beer is LOADED with those same dirty wet hops you were smelling. They are deep and darker on the palate, too. The punch of hops that you expect from a big IPA isn’t there until the swallow. I am not sure why I keep calling this an IPA. It’s not. It’s a strong ale. But they have similar characteristics. When taking a second sip, I quickly realize why this beer is such a good seller. It’s smooth, extremely complex as it slides across the palate, and the aftertaste (which we will get to) is big and lasting.  Mouthfeel: A lot of beer doesn’t do much on the tongue. This one changes shape three or four times on the palate. At first it’s smooth and weak, then those hops start punching you along the way. Then the wet dirty flavors that I mentioned hit, and hops run wild. When you swallow, the bitterness kicks up and you are waiting for an impressive (and it is) aftertaste. It is everything I expected this large beer to be.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste is big. It starts off with a load of hops, then quickly finishes into a dry and bitter flavor. The dryness sticks around, too. The ABV isn’t outrageous, but big enough that one or two of these bottles by yourself could do some damage. The beer is also extremely affordable, so ordering a couple of these might be possible if you can find the right spot. They have a few other versions of this, one that is aged in oak barrels. Haven’t had that one next to this one to compare, but man… Arrogant Bastard Ale is amazing.  I was VERY impressed with this beer. The label might scare you, focused on a devil drinking beer… but as you drink this, imagine what beers of old used to taste like. I can see this beer being shared in a foreign land toasted by a bonfire telling stories of a younger day. No more daydreaming here… let’s drink. Bottoms up, people!  Arrogant Bastard Ale – The bottle says: “arr-ro-gance (air’s gas) n. – The act or quality of being arrogant; haughty; undue assumption; overbearing conceit.  “This is an aggressive ale. You probably won’t like it. It is quite doubtful that you have the taste or sophistication to be able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth. We would suggest that you stick to a safer and more familiar terrify – maybe something with a multi-million dollar ad campaign aimed at convincing you it’s made in a little brewery, or one that implies that their tasteless fizzy yellow beverage will give you more sex appeal. Perhaps you think multi-million dollar ad campaigns make things taste better. Perhaps you’re mouthing your words as you read this.  “At Stone Brewing, we believe that pandering to the lower common denominator represents the height of tyranny – a virtual form of keeping the consumer barefoot and stupid. Bastard Ale openly challenged the tyrannical overlords in the shackles of poor taste. As the progenitor of its style, Arrogant Bastard Ale has reveled in its unprecedented and uncompromising celebration of intensity. There have been many nods to Arrogant Bastard Ale… even outright attempts to copy it… but only one can ever embody the true nature of liquid Arrogance!  “Ingredients: Nothing but the finest barley, most aggressive hops, clearest water, our proprietary yeast strain and abundant arrogance.”",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,dmatsui,3.62,"An aggressive pour from a bomber into a tulip yields a brownish, off-white four finger head with a touch of alcohol legs and good retention. Nice lacing. The brew itself is a malty, dark brown with low opacity. Definitely a mean-looking brew.  Roasty, sweet malts hit the nose first with grassy and caramel qualities dominating. The hops don't come through as piny or as grapefruity as northern california hops,, although there is definitely a bittering and california-esque hop presence.  Whatever hops were veiled in the nose are definitely more present in the taste. Big, bitter hops are present in this aggressively bitter brew with a touch of citrus, but not much. Hop-wise, there is a touch of grapefruity chinook and cascade, but more bittering hops than sweeter varieties. The malt backbone is what makes this beer. It is very sweet and very full-bodied. Hints of roasty coffee and slick oil come through followed by a pleasantly dry finish.  Mouthfeel is very full-bodied and rich, definitely staying with you as the malt characteristics develop. Dry finish and astringent aftertaste.  Arrogant Bastard, in my opinion, is the opitome of Southern California IPA's. I often find that the common denominator of many SoCal brews is very mineral-esque and super bitter, but lacking in the citrusy, sweet Norcal Hop department. Arrogant bastard was definitely one of the first brews that got me into craft brews, and I think it was more striking, more intense the first time I had it a long time ago.

Nice cracked-window style lacing left behind.  Nose is strongly caramel with airy, floral hops nicely pronounced behind the sweetness.  Taste is very sweet upfront with a mix of caramel and honey. The sweetness lets up a bit to allow piney and citrus hops dance a little. There is a grapefruit zest quality, bits of orange peel. The bitterness subsides and allows the beer to finish on the malty side with a slightly toasted, bready quality. Some sips finish a little fruity, bits of figs and raisins.  A decent amount of carbonation helps bring all the flavors to the foreground and the medium-heavy body gives this beer an almost IIPA-type of experience to the drinker.

147,92,VncentLIFE,4.32,"Deep amber body with a frothy off-white head.  I get alot of malt in the smell, and what smells like spices. maybe its a spicy hop characteristic, but it almost seems like ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon.  Very sweet tasting. Caramel and toffee make it sweet and smooth. Almost feels like a slightly bitter English barleywine. The herbal bitterness really comes out in the middle. Late tastes are very sweet and full bodied.  Feels slick and sweet, and that sweetness lingers for a while. Drinks well for the ABV, even considering the full body.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

They have two beers that I can't figure out if people are on something when they drink them because they are just,,,argghh (cough, gag, cough, disgust) SICKENING and I think they must be a joke from the brewmaster.

147,92,estlinska,4.65,"Bomber, poured in a shaker. Pours a deep, dark amber color with some definite ruby-red shining through. Small bubbles race up to a large, frothy head of about 3cm of beige. The head lingers and leaves thick lacing on the glass; a thin film of head remains throughout and leaves a ring to the bottom of the glass. I love the nose of this beer. The hops are by far the dominant force with bright citrusy smells of grapefruit and maybe a touch of orange along with resiny pine. There right behind it, is a backbone of caramel malt, very sweet and definitely very present. I loved taking deep wafts of this one. The taste was hops forward; more citrus and pine note, like on the nose, and blooming on your palate. As the hops develop, there is a good balance with the sweet malts that keep the hops ever so slightly in check. The mouthfeel is almost creamy, but not quite, maybe a touch oily with a long bitter finish. Overall, I have had this beer (along with many others) before I found this site, so I waited till I got it again to give it justice. I think I had it before I had really developed my palate, because I had not remembered this one as good as I found it today. I think it is another example of a beer that makes use of very aggressive hops with good balance with the malt. Very tasty and I will buy it everytime I see it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

It also has a bit of honey, but not enough to overcome the bitter hoppiness.  Taste – More bitter hoppiness. A strong bitter bite, and a lingering bitter aftertaste. I don’t taste much else.  Mouthfeel – Creamy. The hoppiness has a powerful bitter bite to it that makes it feel more carbonated than it is.  Drinkability – Not the best drinking beer. It tastes like it has more than 7.2% abv.

147,92,dbrauneis,4.03,A: Pours a lightly hazy dark amber in color with some light amounts of visible carbonation near the surface of the beer. The beer has a creamy finger tall beige that reduces to an extremely thin film covering the entire surface of the beer with a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant lacing is observed.  S: Moderate aromas of caramel malt sweetness upfront with lots of piney hops.  T: Heavy flavors of pine/resin hops that are quite oily - there is an intense and aggressive bitterness to this beer. Underneath there is a caramel malt sweetness. Not quite in balance but still enjoyable. The bitterness lingers.  M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Crisp.  O: The alcohol is well hidden in this beer but it is not an easy beer to drink - the hoppy bitterness is kind of too intense for my palate. It is an enjoyable but more of a slow sipper - not the greatest match with food (in my opinion) as the flavor is too dominant.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Beautiful lacing is left behind as the beer is consumed.  S- Very complex...it begins with citrus notes of orange and grapfruit. As the head subsides, pine and spice notes dominate along with hints of caramel and orange flesh.  T- Sweet caramel malt up front but is pushed aside by the piney/spicey/citrus rind bitterness. Although a much more pronounced malt backbone, the taste is reminiscent of Torpedo from Sierra Nevada...must share some of the same hops (Magnum & Crystal to be precise) with a definite contribution from Chinook.  M- All the flavors dance on the palate thanks to ample carbonation. Medium bodied, but much lighter than its appearance.  O- Drinks much like an Imperial IPA, but with less residual bitterness. Although I've had AB on multiple occasions, this is my first review and forget how much I enjoy it. Although familiar with its big brother, Double Bastard, I really need to check out the Oak Aged version of this stellar brew. For a flagship, this is as much unique as it is enjoyable.

It`s got a clear, rusty red colour that I can`t recall seeing before. The downside is that the head isn`t very creamy and disappears pretty fast. You can really notice the hops in the smell, which I wasn`t expecting. On second smell, you really notice the malt too. Good balance. Which of course transfers very well to the taste. Sweet malty flavour up front that finishes moderately bitter, with some anise and grapefruit. It`s quite dry.

I can't find a date on this one at all but I'm pretty sure it's old given the taste and the supporting evidence.  The hop notes are basically gone. It presents itself as a malty beer with the ghost of a piney hop note that reads more like the residue of fireworks after the fact- - you know they were there from the lingering notes, but you know you missed them.

Looks are not amazing, but it does have good lacing.  Looks like a dipa or a heavy red ale, which is kinda what it tastes like to me as well. I get a heavy pine and citrus feel from the nose. The actual beer is quite malty but it is so complex and balanced that I am astonished. It isn't even very heavy on the mouth-feel though after a couple pours it is starting to stick to my tongue, pleasantly I might add. There is a fair alcohol burn/hop burn in there, but nothing over the top.  My general impression of this beer is just about how well balanced it is. Good job Stone.

T: Hops first with flavors of pine, citrus and a floral quality. The rich sweeter malt comes in with hints of caramel and some toffee maybe a bit of fruit even. Finish is classic Stone bitterness that just lasts in the mouth. Wow, this is great from tap.  M: Wonderful. Not real thick, but coating and the alcohol is nowhere to be found.

Wow I almost forgot how much I loved this beer. Excellent. My love affair is renewed again with Stone. They just make great beer after great beer. Uber kudos to them.  Update 5/24/2012: Stone sixtels have landed in PA, and a fresh one has made it to my house. As a general update, I am picking up on a lot more citrus notes in both the smell and taste than before with huge grapefruit qualities.

147,92,damndirtyape,4.21,"Served in a mason jar at Coalhouse Pizza, Stamford, CT.  Appearance: Dark hazy copper-amber beer with a light tan to light orange head. Initial 1/4"" head upon serving died down to a thin skin across the top, but plenty of persistent lacing noted as I drank the beer down. Dark, inviting, rich in color and lacing. A great looking beer.  Smell: For all the taste, a bit surprising it wasn't as strong in aroma. A bit of nice malt and citrus hops, but not very strong in aroma. Maybe the glass?  Taste: Strong hop flavor right up front with citrus, orange and just a hint of pine, then moving into a solidly wonderful malt base to counter that hop flavor, and then a just right bitter finish - hoppy, but not a mouth-puckering bitter finish. Oh so good.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, nicely creamy, just right carbonation. To my surprise, did not stick to the teeth as much as I expected.  Overall / Drinkability: A very dangerous beer...I could easily see myself having another one and regretting it later. On the other hand, while strong in flavor, balanced enough that you can get all the flavors in each sip and deeper drink as well such that you want to come back for more. I've had the oaked version of this beer in bottle, but on tap and unoaked...I think it's an even better beer although the smell wasn't as strong as I though it would be.

Love the printed label. I've been wanting to try this beer since I first heard of it.  Poured into a tulip pint glass. A deep reddish-amber hue with good carbonation. Produces a huge head of creamy tan foam with excellent retention; this slowly subsides to a surface layer. Aroma of sweet, biscuity malt with notes of aromatic citrus hops, dry yeast and a serious whiff of booze.  Tastes of sweet malt with an intense bitter finish. Notes of grain, candy sugar, grapefruit, citrus, subtle pine and dry yeast. A warming hint of alcohol in the background. Spicy and prickly, with considerable bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and full-bodied; it flows nicely over the tongue. Highly astringent - dries the palate thoroughly. Aftertaste of bitter aromatic hops and malt.  Fantastic - a definitive US beer. The flavour is perfect, with superb balance between the malt and the bitter/aromatic hops. The body is also solid; the only let-down is the aroma, which is less suggestive than you might expect. If only I could get this regularly for a reasonable price.

147,92,ChrisPratz,4.38,"One of my favorite all time beers. First enjoyed this brew about 6-7 years ago on tap in an old rustic bar that used to be the town courthouse. Beer totally fit the atmosphere. This time, i'm enjoying it from a bomber bottle in a pint glass.  A: Deep red/brown color, not unfiltered but seems to have a hue that makes it not totally transparent. Fill finger of foam head on the top, keeps the lace very very well almost the entire way thru.  S: Lots of hoppiness wafting off the suds, also toasted grains and some sweetness. May have a hint of alcohol as well, which makes sense given the 7%+ ABV. Probably attributed to the carbonation and excellent lacing but the aromas stick around even with just a little bit left at the bottom of the glass.  T: Wow, its been awhile but this beer always impresses. Smooth and tasty all the time, shows some maltyness. Hints of chocolate and some roasted flavors as well as some sweet caramel lead to the hoppyness. Bitter but not overdone. Everything seems to blend well all across the palette and the alcohol taste isn't overpowering despite the higher ABV. Leaves a slight dryness in the mouth but not one that is unenjoyable.  M: Carbonation is perfect. Any more and it would be a bit spikey in the mouth, any less and it may be flat. Again, leaves a slight dry feeling from the alcohol content but it doesn't ruin it in any way/shape/form.  O: Again one of my absolute fav's. It may be a tad expensive but a nice treat to have from time to time.

Seriously, this had a tremendous hop profile with a good bit of yeastiness that almost resembled a nitrogen pour.  T: Palate-wreckingly bitter, but with tons of flavor in every drop. This had all the bitterness of an IPA, but without the citrus. This could be best described as a bitter, melted Jolly Ranch.  M: Lots of lacing on the glass and a good bit of lingering on the palate as well, but it was that special, nihlistically, ""man candy"" type.

The lacing was mild in that there wasn't any rings or any foamy leftovers.  S: mainly the hops in front through a nice bitter sort of way. Some malts appear in the background as she warms.  T: mild bitterness backed up by some citrus and hops.  M: medium sort of body and comes across somewhat surprisingly smooth. Still, there's a decent sort of sessionable aspect to it.

T - Mild bitterness, some citrus in there somewhere, mild coffee, and chocolate flavor.  M - Medium body, smooth.  O - Not bad for a dark beer if you like a hint of citrus in a dark beer.

147,92,Jonmoore89,4.88,"Poured a dark amber, with a tan/cream colored one finger head that stuck until the very end. The aroma was the only thing that I found disappointing. I picked up some sweet/herbal hops and a slight bit of malt, but nothing too special. The first taste... aggressive hops, citrusy, piney, floral, herbal, and mildly malty. The complex taste definitely made up for the lack of aroma. Its medium body and carbonation was perfectly in tune with the taste. Still a sipping beer though. I was interested in trying Arrogant Bastard for a long time and I must say that it lived up the the hype. The story on the back of the bottle is a nice touch as well. Awesome Beer!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,mothman,3.03,"Had this a few times and I really can't get into this beer. I have had it out of the bottle aged a little and it was too malty. I have had it fresh on tap and it was just a whole mess of things going on.  Pours a beige head. Color is an amber.  Aroma: Lots of malts and hops. Caramel and chocolate with floral and grassy hops. Citrus fruits blend in.  Taste: Pretty much the same as the nose. A mix of malts and hops all blended together. Not really my thing. I like the hop profile, but the malts take away from it too much.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and bitter. Medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends sticky.  Overall, as I said early this beer just isn't my thing. Go hops or go malts here. The mix isn't my style for this beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,superspak,4.33,"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 11/3/2017. Pours fairly crystal clear deep brick red color with a 2 finger dense and rocky cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings around the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of chocolate, nuttiness, raisin, fig, date, herbal, floral, grass, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/pine/earthy hops and dark/bready/light roasted malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of chocolate, nuttiness, raisin, fig, date, herbal, floral, grass, and toasted earthiness. Moderate pine, citrus rind, herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread, toasted biscuit, light chocolate/nuttiness, dark fruit, herbal, floral, grass, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine/earthy hops and dark/bready/light roasted malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance; and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready, and sticky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 7.2%. Overall this is an incredible American strong ale! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine/earthy hops and dark/bready/light roasted malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink, despite the fairly aggressively bitter/resinous/drying finish. Really impressive rich malt complexity and balanced dank/earthy Chinook hop presence. A highly enjoyable offering, and spot on style example. Glad they went to cans from the bombers. The price is even better than it was previously.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,hopsolutely,4.03,"Lots of ""west-coast"" hop flavours and overall an excellent american-style strong ale.  Pours a very dark brown/orange amber with coffee-coloured head and much lacing. Aroma of caramelized malts with bitter hop undertones. Flavour follows suit, with bready and sweet malt tastes complementing the piney hop bitterness. The finish lingers for an exceptionally long time.  Definitely a bottle to buy again, and next time I will commit to enjoying it ""fresh"" - as I think that would be even more impressive.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Sweet caramel and aromatic grapefruit hops. Lots of hop bitterness. Toasted character. A slight sweetness. Bread. Medium bodied. Great complimentary level of carbonation. Pretty dry finish.

147,92,iSip,3.5,"Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale, 22 oz. bomber: Another fine product from Stone. The Arrogant Bastard Ale is pretty dark in color, a dark amber I would say. The head is pretty thin, of an even consistency and despite being thin, does last and laces well. An aroma of malts and subtle hops comes through. While the Stone IPA and double IPA are huge in the hops department, this brew focuses on the malt, and the hops compliment the malt very well. Expect a flavorful but balanced experience if you try the Arrogant Bastard, with a focus on the malt.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,oriolesfan4,4.18,"Pours a copper color with a nice fluffy head. Taste is medium bodied, great caramel malt upfront with some nice balancing hops on the back end.

Super smooth with great drinkability, this beer is dangerously good.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,microbrewlover,3.88,"This brew pours a deep copper color, almost brown with a three finger head, some of which is still present at the bottom of the glass. Heavy lacing remains in the glass throughout.  The smell is of floral hops, carmel, toasted grains and also some spice I can not identify; possibly pepper.  The mouthfeel is biscuty and chewy. There is also a slight grainy taste.  The hop oils dominate from start to finish. However mixed in is the carmel malt then the toasted grain and biscut taste. There is also a spice, it might be pepper. The taste starts and finishes with a clean floral hop taste. The alchohol taste is well masked.  Overall this is a good brew but I believe a few more malts would balance it out.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Off-white head that lingers well. Lots of lacing.  Smell has lots of hoppy citrus. Pine, grapefruit and some lemon.  Taste follows the smell well. Nice bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel has moderate carbonation and a very dry finish.  Overall I did'nt expect much from this because it was so old and I have heard that ABA should be had fresh. It seems to have aged very well. Held its hoppiness well. Glad I did'nt throw this out.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,GNWBC,4,"P: pours a clear dark red/brown with light head that fades after a while.  S: strong malt and hop notes with some light citrus hanging around.

OA: surely worthy of its reputation.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

M- Excellent amount of carbonation. Walks the line of being a perfect feel of carbonation. Dry finish.  Overall this is a flavourful and suprisingly complex beer. The body looks just as delicious after sitting in my Tulip for 10 minutes as it did on the pour. 1 pint should be no problem to finish.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,TheSixthRing,4.24,"Appearance - Pours a beautiful dark ruby amber with a frothy, off-white 3-finger head. The head sits for a good few minutes before giving way to a nice, remarkable sticky lacing.  Smell - Primarily a light, sweet ruby red grapefruit aroma, and not much else on the nose.  Taste - There's a bit of chocolate, caramel and coffee to start, then quickly gives way to an aggressive, bitter citrus grapefruit hop that rides through into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Full bodied, complimented by creamy carbonation... but the sheer aggressive bitterness makes this one a sipper, not a chugger.  Overall - While technically classified as a Strong Ale, Arrogant Bastard has the hop bitterness to rival that of the strongest 2IPA's, maybe more. It's a beer that can be, at times, tough to get through, but when one takes it's time, the beauty in this beer shines as bright as the best ales made.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,N3rdM3t4l,3.21,"A: Dark red and kinda clear with huge 3finger rocky off white head that faded to one finger with great lacing. Looks delicious.  S: A touch fruity with lots of toasty malts. Slightly hoppy, not the most fragrant beer.  T: Bitter from start to finish but not in a bad way. Dark malt and hops is about all I can taste on this one. Not sure if the fruityness is just on the nose or if the bitterness is overpowering it. Good stuff but not something I would keep as a standby. leaves a long strong bitter on the tongue like a NWIPA (Total Domination by Ninkasi comes to mind since I am from Eugene)  M: Medium body with good carbonation, goes down easy.

T: very much of the same as the scent, but oh so beautiful.  O: The description on the back of the bottle is beautiful, It doesn't describe the beer one bit, it's just hilarious... this is perhaps... my second favorite beer to date.

Smells slightly medicinal with barley malt, hops, and a little toffee to round it out. Semi-sweet smelling. This is a stong ale, with waves of hop that have big bitter characteristics. Taste is very layered with the bitter hops being most prominent, plenty of barley, and some toffee/coffee undertones. Mouthfeel is great. Creamy yet crisp, but a tad oily.

The flavor is somewhat extreme but well balanced. The strong hop bitterness mixes well with a sweet malty caramel that sticks to your mouth. It is finished by a somewhat strong alcoholic kick. It gets better as you let it settle towards cellar temperatures.  This is a great American Strong Ale.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,mlazzaro,4.11,"Burgundy colored body under a tan head. Head holds really nicely for a a high ABV beer. Laces the glass with every sip. No yeast on bottom of bottle (no aging required). Smells like piney hops and caramel malt. A clean yeast aroma comes through as well. Tastes bitter - sweet, both really intense flavors and work pretty well together. sip ends with a solid blast of alcohol. Tastes like Chinook hops and Northern Brewer hops to me. Almost resinous from hops, and yet a malt dominant flavor. Pretty unique and awesome beer. Used to be a staple of mine in college days. ""We're not worthy. We're scum!

Muted sweeter malts and some dull caramel and other malts. Hard to describe, but a fairly complex and very enjoyable flavor.  M- Goes down somewhat thick, almost syrupy. Poured the same way. Not a lot of carbonation. A good weight for the flavor profile.  Overall, I was fairly impressed with such a widely distributed and available brew.

147,92,BTFU,4.97,"Serving type - 22 oz bottle...READ THE BOTTLE, its hilarious  A - A deep brownish red that produces a a head that looks clean but has a hint of yellow/red in it. It laces down the glass as you go  S - The moment you pop the cap off you can already tell there's a lot in store. The hops are strong and prominent but not harsh  T - An amazing mix of both roasted grains and fruitier/lighter parts. There's hints of chocolate and nuts blended with the different barley and grain elements. The hops receive more attention as the beer loses its chill and the warmth allows it to blend amazingly well so the entire beer can be appreciated.  M - The head is thick and tasty and the beer comes through it, picking up just enough of the head on the way through so you get all of the arrogant-ness!  O - Definitely a beer that shouldn't be served super cold. Just chilled and as it warms up some it changes and opens up even more.

147,92,Arborescence,3.84,"Appearance: Deep brown, a little hazy, pours a creamy head that lasts.  Aroma: Hoppy, reminds me of a strong pale ale, a hint of iron?  Taste: Hoppy bitterness, IPA-like characteristics, not much malt at all, although one might expect it from looking at the beer. It is nevertheless quite smooth.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, with medium carbonation.  Overall: I’ve had the Arrogant Bastard from tap before, and I recall quite liking it. It’s hoppier than I remembered, and indeed you’d think that this is a particularly bitter IPA from just tasting it. The strange thing is that it looks like a brown ale, and the creamy head would suggest something completely different than what you get: in your face hoppy intensity. Stone Brewing makes a case for this beer being something alternative that not many people will like, but actually I think that this comes quite close to some of the stronger and bolder IPAs or maybe Double Pale Ales that are not uncommon in the US. This makes me surprised about how highly rated the beer is.

Wonderful amount of carbonatation and lots of lacing down the glass. I smell piney hops, pepper and caramel as well though I did have to work hard to pick these up. Earthy tasting hop bitterness which is followed by a bready toastiness. I like that the malts were more bitter/toasty than sweet. This is a bold tasting beer. It's medium to full bodied. I get a resinious hop texture right along with some crispness up front. After the toasty malts I'm left with a strong after taste that lingers on the tongue for a few seconds.

There's a tiny bit of fruitiness coming out too. Nicely fruity and floral.  Like the smell, the taste is dominated by hops, with the fruit coming in the middle to give it some nice sweetness, and then a slightly malty finish.

It's got a little harshness and some dryness, but that doesn't negatively affect it.  It's a strong ale, good and bold. Maybe too bold to be my everyday beer, but very good.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Clowerweb,4.16,"Poured aggressively from a 22oz. brown bomber into a pint glass. Couldn't find a date on the bottle, but there was a code: ""NJ0 03"" lightly etched in the back of the bottle near the base of the neck, presumably a batch number.  I've already had the Double Bastard, but never tried this one, so I'm going backwards I guess.  A: First, the typical Stone hilarious shenanigans on the back of the bottle, making fun of macro breweries, defining arrogance, and talking about how you're tasteless and not worthy of drinking this beer, because you're probably an average macro beer lover and have not been prepared for this beer, thus you won't like it.  Crimson in color, indisputably very dark almost blood red with red/orange highlights. No cloudiness or sediment, although it's dark enough to be about 90% opaque. Four fingers of thick creamy khaki-colored head with bubbles so small and tight as to be nearly invisible. It looks like light brown whipped cream. Insane retention, and very thick and creamy lacing. A solid finger of head still left 5 minutes after the pour.  S: Fruity aroma, not quite as aromatic as I'd hoped, but it's close to perfect in aromatic strength. Nose is dark fruits and semi sweet floral hops. Not a huge amount of depth to the nose, but leaves me curious. Has a strange bit of a wet dog kind of smell in there which is a little off putting.  T: The flavor doesn't match up with the nose very much. After taking in the aroma, I was expecting it to taste a bit different, I expected more fruitiness and sweetness. The flavor isn't bad though, but not really what you might expect after smelling it.  Starts off with some in-your-face bitterness and dry hops, mid palate has notes of sweet molasses with hints of dark fruit and oaty malts, finishes bittersweet and semi-dry leaving a fruity yet bitter aftertaste. It certainly isn't unpleasant and it has a unique character, but a little too bitter and dry on the finish, and has some astringency. The flavor is not as complex as its big brother Double Bastard.  M: Nice and full, high gravity, lighter carbonation that does leave a tingly feeling all over the mouth for quite some time, sticky and chewy, but it does leave some astringency behind and a bit of grittiness and dryness. I'd say this is a bit fuller than the Double Bastard, but feels a bit harsher and drier.  O: Overall, very drinkable though a bit on the bitter and astringent side. The dryness and bitterness might be good for some, but it's a bit overdone for my palate. Yet, it is somehow still enjoyable for me, and it also comes with a significantly reduced price tag as compared to its big brother.  Worth trying, and there are some good aspects to this beer, although there are some negative aspects as well. Will I buy it again? Probably not, but not because it's a bad beer (it's an overall pretty good beer), but because there are cheaper beers that I enjoy a little more. I'd certainly drink it again if if given the opportunity to not pay $6 for a bomber.  If you're looking for an excellent Stone experience, pass this one up and pay another $1 - $2 for the Double.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

A - The beer pours a dark red almost brown mahogany color with dark red edges in the light with a thin 1 finger tan/light brown colored head with some retention and lacing. Not as much head as I would have expected.  S - An interesting aroma with a strong caramel malt character together with a very nice blend of citrusy aromas. A faint bread quality but a nice blend between citrus and malt.  T - Very good flavor, very good. The nice blend between malt and citrus hop flavor found on the nose but amplified and well balanced. A medium bitterness. Hides the alcohol very well behind the sweet caramel malts and hop bitterness and citrus flavors.  M - Medium to full bodied with good carbonation.  O - A very good beer.

I looked in my reviews and realized I had only reviewed the oaked AB, but never the original. I always have a few around from time to time, so what better time to review when im feeling all nostalgic... So overall, this is an amazing, riddle of a beer that has an earned cult following. I would recommend this beer to any person who wants to get into craft brew, and I hope they hate it and grin the first time they see the marketing, but they'll come back and realize, especially after trying 90% of the other crap out there, that this is the top, and a major part of the reason the craft industry is so strong.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I was at a beer dinner sponsored by Stone, and this was part of the four course dinner. They paired it with pork belly, and it worked well together.  If you haven't had Arrogant Bastard... go to the liquor store; it is there.  What started as an error, became an excellent old ale.  It smells and tastes great.

The head is off white and measures a finger's width, leaving some sticky lacing on the sides of the goblet. The aroma offers pine, hops, malt, bread, alcohol.

147,92,beerbellydaddy,4.18,"Arrogant Bastard Ale  This beer poured from a 22 ounce bottle provides a clear but dark reddish amber flow. It erupts into frothy 3 to 4 finger creamy foam, and leaves long standing lacing.  The scent is heavy malts balanced by hops, uninterrupted by much else.  The taste is reflective of the scent, but reversed with heavier hops, and a mild oak undertone. This is a straight forward ale taste, unencumbered by exotic extras.  A mouthful is creamy with just the right punch of carbonation. It is substantial but still refreshing.  Overall, this is another winner by Stone, and is an excellent example of a strong American ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,RyanLigeia,3.7,Appearance- Clear amber color with a decent head that sticks around for a while and leaves lots of lacing.  Smell- Smells very hoppy with some malt sweetness in there too. In a blind test I'd probably guess it was an IPA.  Taste- Same as smell. It tastes very similar to an IPA with hints of caramel and other mildly sweet flavors that balance out the bite of the hoppiness a little. It packs a bit of a punch and has a lasting piny hop IPA taste.  Mouthfeel- Some good carbination that goes nicely with the flavor of the beer.  Overall- Overall I give it a 4 1/2. Great beer for the price and the availability is very convenient.

147,92,TheCorkStopsHere,4.27,"I've had this brew several times, and I don't think I've ever actually sat down to evaluate it. So, here goes…  The distinctive 22oz painted bottle sticks out on the shelf like a sore thumb. The gargoyle catches your eye immediately. If you take the time to read the back of the bottle, you endure a few insults, insinuations, and some other comical anecdotes.  The Arrogant Bastard pours a dark rusty color, and fairly opaque. The foam is heavy at first, but subsides relatively quickly. The almond-colored foam leaves behind a fairly heavy lacing. There is very little, if any, carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass, which surprises me. At 7.2% abv, I expected more visible carbonation.  Putting my nose in the glass, I'm getting some hops, but nothing over-whelming. It's not nearly as hoppy in the nose as the Lagunitas Hop Stoopid I had last night. I'm also getting a bit of malts, but very roasty, almost burnt malts.  Once I take a sip, I remember why I never review this beer. It really is just like they describe on the bottle! The Arrogant Bastard is mildly hoppy, but well ""balanced"" with some dark roasted (burnt) malts. I say ""balanced"" because the two don't really seem to balance either other at all. It's as if you took the oil and vinegar and through them into a pot in exactly the same proportions. Just because it's equal, doesn't mean it's balanced.  The malt sweetness is definitely present, but very short-lived. The hops seem to stick to my tongue for hours. The brew overall is kind-of rough, strong, and I don't know, the exact opposite of mellow, smooth and balanced?!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Lacing is also very sticky and abundant as well.  Smell - Sweet Caramel & Toffee, along with some fairly potent piney hops. There's also some pretty hefty malts in here as well, giving it more of a sweeter sort of scent. No matter how you look at it, it smell absolutely delicious. I kind of don't even want to drink this because it smells so good!  Taste - Piney Hops & Very Sweet Toffee hit the palette hard with a sort of resin-like aftertaste with licorice kick. The malts aren't quite what I would call roasted, but more of a slightly roasted sort of malt. It all comes together to make for a delicious tasting ale that masks the alcohol very well.  Mouthfeel - It's pretty heavy in body and the carbonation packs a little bite. This is an example of an ale that you really need to sit down and enjoy, as this is not what you would call an easy drinker for some  Overall - This isn't a beer for everyone, but that's okay. .

For some reason it is not sold in Alabama, but I did get a bottle in New Jersey and several drafts in Florida before I started reviewing on the Beer Advocate. This review is from last night where I enjoyed a draft at the Brewhouse South in Franklin, TN (just south of Nashville). This is the only beer I always look for when I go to a new drinking establishment.  This beer is everything the other 2700+ reviewers have said and then some! It is listed as a strong ale and that is exactly what it is. This beer is not for the meek or timid. The only advantage to having a bottle over a draft is everyone will know what you are drinking and you get to read the label affirming your arrogance.  Arrogant Bastard Ale is a strong dark ale with lots of hops and a full body mouthfeel. It is as dark as the devil with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Try this beer.

This is a beer without any major flavors popping out, but all of them working in concert to deliver a bold, smooth experience.

Great smell it's got that southern California hops smell, which i have grown to love, nice and sweet.

T: Lots of barley, they are so evident they cover up the other tastes completely almost, vanilla notes on the tailend.  M: Meduim bodied, goes down very smooth, mid carbonation.

147,92,dunit697,3.69,"Let me start out by saying I am not a big Stone fan. I think the hops are normally a bit extreme. This beer is no exception, I tried grading very objectively and most standards its a good beer. I personally only recommend Stone Beer's in general if you love hops to death.

147,92,BuxMontBeerLover,4.3,"I've had this many times and was one of the first craft beers I ever had. Review is from a bomber I purchased and enjoyed at Hawkeye's Restaurant in Perkasie, PA.  Poured and enjoyed in a standard pint glass.  A - Pours a deep amber/reddish color. Semi-translucent. Pours with a one finger head that fades to a light skim. Good amount of lacing left after finishing.  S - A hoppy, caramel-like aroma. Very inviting.  T- An aggressive beer that lives up to the story on the back of the bottle. A mix of a caramel-like sweetness from the malts and a hefty dose of bitter hops. I also get a fig-like taste. A really great beer. The alcohol is well disguised. Not a beer to give to your BMC buddies!  M - A medium consistency. Light carbonation. A bitter aftertaste.  O - This beer lives up to its reputation as a great beer. Simply put, a ""classic"" in the craft beer community. Highly recommended.  Cheers!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Hopfenpeter,4.03,"The beer poured a very attractive hazy deep amber/mahogany with a tan frothy, creamy head building about two fingers high. It had great retention and excellent lacing. The smell is fruity, mostly citrus, with peach and pineapple. Tasting the beer, the pineapple comes across first, with a mixture of citrus and peach. In the middle the hops give the beer the needed balance. The finish is dominated by more earthy, bitter hops. Over all a very good beer, which is a must try!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Very thin off white had that subsided to some little resting wisps and a thin collar that leaves some splotchy lace behind.  S: Some citrus fruit smells, mostly light grapefruit. A caramel malt presence with a light grassy hop undertone rounds it out.  T: A toasted malt body with a slight sweet caramel makes up the body of this beer. There are nice citrus grapefruit and grassy-like hop undertones that brings the beer together. Slight bitterness on the finish. Very good.  M: Full bodied with good carbonation and a bready malt aftertaste. Very drinkable.  O: The oaked version is much better in terms of the complexity the barrel adds, but this is right up there with that version and it is just as drinkable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

It's hard to make out the level of carbonation and there is some good lacing on the sides of the glass. The head lasted for 4 minutes before it was gone.  Smell - Malts, hops, dark fruits, caramel  Taste & Mouth - The beer has an average amount of carbonation and I can taste raisins, malts, and a caramel flavour. I can also taste hops and pine mixed with an odd vegetable flavour. I've had this beer before and I don't recall this odd flavour, but it's something along the lines of cauliflower.. I must be losing my mind. Anyways, it ends with a malty hoppy aftertaste.  Overall – When I had this from a bottle I was impressed with how complex the flavour was. It was like a mixed bad of all kids of tastes.

Carbonation lasts well if your tongue can take the workout. Pleasing head on the amber brew with nice lacing.  From the cask at The Linkery in San Diego. I thought it might be interesting to try the cask version, but I wish I hadn't.

Lots of sweet malts up front, some biscuit and caramel. Hops take over quickly though and aggressively, with a minty ester presence. Medium to full in body with a chewy grainy presence. Very dry finish with big bitterness. Delicately floral flavors are present for such an arrogant beer.

Citrus fruit aroma. Incredibly complex.  Flavor is unparalleled. Starts with a bold, hearty, rye bread malt character. Assertive hop comes to life in the perfect balance with a spicy herbal, citrusy, pine flavor. Definitely has some Cascade hops. Sweet caramel, toffee, toasted almonds come in later adding depth and mellowing out the experience. Finishes semi-dry with tons of lingering flavors.  Medium to full bodied yet not syrupy.

About halfway through the glass i smelled a huge pine aroma, once the chill from the fridge wore off.  M: medium feel for a split second followed by spikey carbonation.  T: very bitter hoppy flavor. I do get some tiny bit of maltiness in there but the hops dominate that. Its easy to taste only bitter hops if you're not paying attention.

Comes with a nice cappuccino style head.  The smell reminds me of a West Coast IPA. Citrus, pine but with added caramel.  In your face flavors. Hop all over the place but also dark malts and a wee bit of citrus.  Nice medium body with a decent amount of carbonation and a rather dry finish. Bitter flavors will linger for a while.

A - Two-finger tan head. Deep reddish-brown, iced-tea color. Slight haze. Delicate sticky lacing.  T - Impressive but not overbearing bitterness upfront. Citrus, pine, grapefruit rind hop flavor follows and a subtle maltiness protrudes in the middle. Sweetness increases as the beer warms. Finishes lightly burnt with a mild roasty quality and lingering hop bitterness. Slight detection of alcohol with warmth. Balance trends more to the hops, but malt profile is well represented especially as it warms.  M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

T: As in the nose, bitter hops lead the way. The emphasis on bitter pine needles and resin is something I've never gotten accustomed to with this beer. Mild citrus elements in the mid-taste, which transition into caramel and dark fruit. The finish is a piney hop punch again.  M: Medium-full bodied with tons of sticky, lingering bitterness. I prefer a cleaner flavor profile, one that doesn't totally ruin your palate. But that's arguably my own shortcoming.  O: I've never enjoyed this beer, and I can't figure out why.

147,92,troysoy2,4.58,"I hope this beer is as fun as the hype leads me to believe. For starters, the rant on the bottle definitely does not let you down.  Poured into a pint glass, the hue is flat out blood red, not even amber. It almost looks like it could be some kind of crazy fruit cocktail, except that it it has a nice off-white, creamy head that sticks around for quite a while. The lacing is pretty cool looking, as it coats the entire glass in a layer of frosting.  The smell is surprisingly laid back and subtle, and I would be inclined to agree with a previous reviewer here; it's almost confectionery in nature. As I allowed the beer to warm up a bit, the hops showed up a little bit, but still the scent was distant and whispering.  And wow, I was definitely not prepared for the taste. Immediately, there is a kick of sweet, dark fruits. Followed by a full out hop attack, with lingering bits or grapefruit and warm, piney alcohol. All this is supported by a superb prickly mouthfeel that foams up in your mouth.  Yep, this is a good beer. Countless reviews before me have echoed the same sentiment, and I don't doubt that I will be buying more of this in the future in hopes that I can get to know this Arrogant Bastard a little better...

When I first had this one, I was taken aback by how well the 'supposed extreme' hop bitterness was balanced by a sweet malt base; the second time, I was unimpressed by how generically bitter and one note it was.

Slowly, it gives way to biscuity malt and leaves more bitterness on the finish. It’s not as aggressive as the label implies, but times have changed since then.

147,92,Pintofbrown,4.1,"App- The beer pours dark amber that has copper highlights. There is one finger of white head with an orange tinge. And man is the head creamy looking!  Smell- It is all hops in the smell with just a touch of malt. The hops used are of a citrus and grassy variety. There are notes of grapefruit and tangerine. The malt is more of a mellow vanilla and slight biscuit quality. It is definitely good to sniff.  Taste- The hop is strong with this ale. It goes through the entire drink and lasts long into the finish. Again there are the powerful citrus notes, mainly grapefruit and some orange in there. There is also a sense of resin hop too, sort of pine. The grassy hop is there but is more of a hay flavor. The malt is almost completely masked, although there is a creamy feeling that is sort of sweet, biscuit malt like.  Mouth feel- It is medium bodied and gets some carbonation lift going on the tongue. The intense hop action also manages to dry this one a little, but it isn’t bad.  Overall- This strong ale is incredibly intense with its hop bitterness and semi-dry finish, yet you can’t stop sipping.

S- Rich oak with sweet malt characteristics that smells a little nutty with coffee and fresh bread. Also a moderate hop bite in the background with a some citrus notes and a little pine.  T- There is an interesting ""malt sandwich"" going on with the taste. There is an initial hit of hoppy-fruitiness. A really subtle but nice citrus flavor. Then the malt rolls in with a good oakey taste and some sweet carmel notes and a carry over of some coffee. The malt is followed quickly by a punishing amount of tongue-numbing hoppy citrusy bitterness. Seriously, the happiness blew me away this first time i tried it. It is a powerful, beautiful bitter aftertaste that is balanced out by the malts before.  M- Smooth and well bodied. Good mouthfeel for the strength and flavor.  O- Awesome beer. Seriously, awesome.

Not what I was expecting but it looks nice.  S: Some caramel up front followed by piney hops.  T: Whatever else I smelled initially tries to make its way out on the front end of this beer, but it is fairly futile effort. This beer is dominated with hops. Resiny, piney hops. Coats the back of the tongue and lingers for minutes after the sip. Finishes dry. This beer hides the alcohol well as it isn't really present.  M: Medium to full body and has enough carbonation to not leave a syrupy feeling.  O: A good beer, not overly complex in my eyes but maybe I just don't know that much.

147,92,GossageBrewery,4.38,"Poured this American Strong Ale into a pint glass. The ale poured a dark reddish brown color, produced a off white medium head. Head retention was excellent. Lacing was amazing- nice rings of lace all over the glass. The aroma of the American Strong Ale is full of roasted malt grain and prunes. This is a medium body beer, very drinkable for a Stong Ale. Awesome session beer. Craft Brewing at its best. The taste is malty sweet, almost sticky- Deep roasted taste, full of caramel, dark chocolate and coffee. Finish's sweet. This beer has BALLS- Best example of an American Strong Ale I have had to date.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,amphion1065,3.31,"I was pleasantly surprised to be served a full pint of this - gotta love Cambridge Common. Reviewed from notes.  Pours a very deep, brown copper shade, with red highlights throughout. A pillowy cappuccino foam head with very tight bubble sticks around for a while. Excellent cascading lacing all over my glass.  As classic a Stone aroma as any beer that brewery produces. Resinous, sticky, piney hops are here in abundance. Just a very rich hop profile, though there's fairly minimal citrus fruits. There's a floral quality to the aroma I can't quite define, but it's pleasant. Oddly enough, some cocoa is in the mix as well; it works, too.  Unsurprisingly, the hops really shine in this beer. Balance is notably absent from the flavor; bitterness is not. Following closely on the smell, the taste is rich with resiny pine. The bitterness lingered for quite a while - I couldn't imagine drinking a different beer after this one.  More carbonation would be ideal, as it almost seems syrupy. Though the ABV is on the moderate side, this isn't a beer I'd be wont to drink a lot of.  This style is such a broad swath catchall that it's tough to rate Arrogant Bastard within its confines. Like a lot of offerings from Stone, I'm not terribly crazy about this beer and find it a little one-dimensional. However, the over-the-top hop bitterness is an intended effect, and for that I can say that this beer is a success.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,CyclingLush666,3.71,"The beer's appearance is a very nice and dark brown amber color. Almost to the point where you can't see through the glass, so you can assume its going to be a very strong taste.  The smell is very hoppy, which you would expect because Stone claims to have very an insane amount of hops in their beer. The smell isn't extremely strong though, and some of their other beers have a much stronger scent.  The taste is very nice, a sort of slap you in the face with hops type of deal. That's basically it though. Stone beers are usually not that extremely complex, so what you get here is simple but good. It's also a very bitter beer, so if that's not your thing I wouldn't try and get one of these down.  I'm not really impressed with the mouthfeel. It has the basic mouthfeel of most ales. Some of their other beers like the Sublimely Self Righteous Ale has a much better texture.  Overall I would say this is a very nice beer. But if hoppy as hell bitter beers are not your thing, I wouldn't waste your time. But if you like IPA beers I would grab one of these 22's the next time you get a chance. They are kind of expensive usually around 6 bucks for one of these, and some of their others are even more expensive but its well worth it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,CHickman,4.3,"Pours a very dark red brownish color where the red and lighter shades are only visible near the top and bottom when held up to the light; had a creamy 1 finger tan head that faded and left great lacing clinging to the glass, and the lacing basically didn’t move and just stuck to the sides. A good looking and menacing beer that tries to back up the warning: “You’re Not Worthy.”  Smells of all kinds of hops, including floral hops, piney hops, citrus hops, sweet malt, flowers, caramel, grapefruit, orange peel, fruit like apple or pear, toasted grains, wheat bread, light wheat, grass, syrup, brown sugar and light alcohol; the initial hop whiff gives way to grains for a very nice and balanced smelling beer that does not hide the fact that the alcohol is present and has a kick. There is a sweetness throughout the nose that ties it all together well.  Tastes like floral hops, grass, hay, flowers, piney hops/pine cones, toasted grains, roasted malt, citrus hops, grapefruit, caramel, orange peel, coffee grinds, oats, spices like pepper and coriander, faint alcohol that brings minor heat and some earthy flavors like tea leaf, peat moss or very dry hops that almost taste burnt. The malts show up to tame the hops, while the grains seem to dominate towards the finish which is on the dry side. The alcohol peeks through but is not a offensive and works well with the complexities and spices.  Mouthfeel is slick yet chewy and fizzy at the same time, with a medium to heavy body and light carbonation that always seems to slide down easy; this is very smooth considering how high the ABV is and how complex, strong and flavorful it is.  The drinkability is high for strong ale, and to me this beer has been always been very enjoyable for the past few years. This is a consistent staple at my family gatherings since we are “worthy”, and while other Stone beers might actually taste better, to me this is still always tasty and I feel loyal to this flagship Stone product which has brought a lot of enjoyment over the years. I am a huge fan of this and could drink this beer all year round and suggest that everyone try it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,bylerteck,4.45,"Bottle from the Potsdam IGA. From notes.  A - Poured a dark ruby red. Bright. Good carbonation and a two finger tan head. It looked great in the wine glass I used. The thick and creamy head left great lace and a half finger of retention.  S - Fruity hops, Pacific Northwest hops, caramel, juicy and piney hops with some bread and caramel. A great blend. An Americanized take on a beefy ESB? Really quite complex and inviting.  T - Deep rich caramel and a giant pure hop punch. Tons of pine and resin. Huge, aggressive hops blending with caramel and bread. Very nice.  M - Medium carbonation , full body, fairly bitter.  O/D - Great. Sessionable while being extremely aggressive.

A white head laces in thick strata around the glass.  S: Very malty. Very hoppy. Plenty of both make this beer fire. The caramel is syrupy, a sweetly dry introduction that coaxes out the citrusy pine bitterness of the ale. Big and bold.  T: The caramel jumps out as the malts stake an early lead. That richness tends to linger throughout the ale. The hops, piney and citrusy, quickly come in to balance things out. They bring an intensity that is both hoppy and flavorful. A boozy warmth runs throughout the ale.  M: A delicious fullness that doesn't feel nearly as strong as it actually is. Plenty of hops but more than enough balance.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Lacing around the glass is consistent and the retention of the head last until the last drop.  The aroma is rich with hops! Sour citrus and pine notes, yet the sweet malt and alcohol pulls through.  Rich flavor of intense hops. Sour citrus and bitter pine hops dominate. But at the same time the malt in this ale still makes is presence. Finishes dry and hoppy, mostly the pine notes but the citrus lingers on the palate.  Full bodied and dangerous to drink haha! Slightly slick on the tongue.

I can tell this is an ""aggressive"" beer right off the bat.  Taste is similar to smell with grapefruit, floral hops, and a strong toasted malt backbone. Aftertaste is slightly burnt tasting and bitter.  Every sip leaves behind a sticky hop resin feeling..a touch of booze.  I find myself enjoying this one a lot. Cheers.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

My sniffer is in a frenzy.  T- The blast of hops is superbly combatted by the sweet malty finish. Spicy, nom nom. Everything really starts to come through as it warms. The only way it shows it's 7 percent is in my belly warmth.  MF- Creamy and chewy like homemade caramels. Well-suited carbonation, lingers on the tongue.

S- Hoppy, earthy smelling, with some hints of spruce, and something vaguely nutty.  T- Aggressive hops, but finishes almost on a more light note. This beer definitely has some bite, and in some ways I do think the alcohol is a bit too present in it. Faint taste of toffee.  M- Little bit oily, but smooth, light carbonation. Good.

Really looks fantastic.  Smell - Toffee, carmel, molasses, ripe plum and raisin, some citrus, orangepeel.  Taste - My goodness, starts creamy carmel and toffee, quickly goes to dark ripe fruits, then ruby grapefruit and orangepeel. Then moments after the sip citrussy hops begin to blossom all over the tongue, first grapefruit, then dried grapefruit peel, then some sticky pine way long in the finish. So many great powerful flavors, each taking front stage, the progression is smooth and...and arrogant!  Mouthfeel - A nice creamy mouthfeel, with a wonderful dryness and some pucker at the end. Carb is low/medium, and is a perfect accent crispness during the flavor progressions.  Overall - I tried this initially before joining BA, and have been wanting to review this since joining. It is even better than I remembered, and is truly a fantastic, flavorful and powerful ale. I will be picking this one up far more often. It is imperative that you see ""if you are worthy"", definitely give this one a try, two thumbs way up for me.

T: Lots of sweet malts are up front bringing in caramel and toffee and a nice roasted flavor before the hops make their presence felt in a big way. The hops bring a spicy, piney flavor and leave the mouth with a nice bitter aftertaste. Big flavor on this beer, with a lot of balance between the sweet and bitter.  M: Medium bodied, with a tingly spiciness, but still comes off as creamy...  O: Big flavor, lots of balance and a heavy hit of alcohol. This beer is definitely a classic for a reason.

Just a wonderful nose. Pineapple, maraschino cherries, sweet malt. Stone consistently has some of the most robust and complex smells I've gotten my smeller in.  Malty sweet, caramel, with hints of a juicy-juice fruit punch party, yeah, that's right, I said juicy-juice, wanna fight about it? Hops come in bitter, and sour a tad, but just balance out beautifully with the sweets. Despite some vocal hops, the mouth is pretty darn smooth and the whole thing is nicely drinkable.

M - Great drinker, but the hoppy potency does do some damage on your taste buds. Medium body, and ends with a raspy feel.  O - This is a solid beer that benefits from its availability.

I’m not complaining, however, I don’t even love highly sweet beers. This beer is definitely tasty, but I would like to revisit it in a food pairing situation.

147,92,mayorwalda,4.45,"I'm told I'm not worthy, and you know what, it might be true.  Stone Brewery's Arrogant Bastard Ale is quite a beauty to behold. From the pour you get a nice, dark brew, a deep red glow, that generates a good two finger head atop your glass that sits around for a long while, and leaves behind a bit of lace.  The aroma of this beer, before the first sip, is a hop-centric, somewhat grassy, somewhat piney bitter aroma which surprised me considering this brew's dark, malt-rich appearance.  Upon the first sip, a sip savored quite a while, I got a huge array of flavors that bring in, seemingly, every ingredient in this beer in their own organized waves. Initially, you get the bitter, somewhat tart taste of resinous malts and heaping amounts of hopps. After that taste hits your palate, though, you start to taste some of the sweetness of the malt and fruits they brew with all those hops! From the malt selection in this brew you can taste, primarily, some caramel malts complimented--if not just for color--by a bit of dark roast malts followed closely by a light and citrusy sweetness, as well as maybe a bit of tropical fruit. In short the taste of this ale is a roller coaster ride to be enjoyed full nice and slow, sip after sip.  While in mouth the mouthfeel of this brew can almost be ignored due to the immense amount of flavor going on in this brew, but this beer has a very complimentary medium body.  A: Dark, red, and frothy, with a good head and some lace. S: Piney, hoppy and green, with a little bit of sweetness on the tail end. T: Whoa! The taste is the total selling point of this brew. From hopps to fruit to malt this brew has it all in an unmatched, organized array of flavor. M: Mouthfeel can be ignored for the most part but this beer's medium body compliments every other aspect really well. O: Arrogant Bastard Ale is marketed correctly, I'd say. It's a wild brew with some serious flavor and a lot of complexity, which is miraculously well organized--it doesn't taste like everything at once. It also does a good job of keeping a first timer on their toes looking like a dark brew, smelling like an IPA and tasting like a well balanced red ale (with some uncharacteristic qualities!).

A thin layer of head remained as I drank the beer down. Impressive lacing was left on the glass all the way down.  S: This beer has a very present scent. The malt hit me first followed by the hops. On subsequent smells, the hops and malt blended quite well. I get roasted and biscuit malt scents with resiny, spicy hop scent.  T: This is a big tasting beer. Lots of roasted, biscuit malt with a generous amount of dank, bitter hops. The balance achieved between the two is phenomenal.  M: The beer has a medium to heavy mouthfeel. It leaves an after taste that is slightly dominated by the malt but the hops are definitely present. The aftertaste mostly lingers on the middle and back of my tongue and not on the roof of my mouth as I find happening with some of the extreme IPAs.  O: This is a phenomenal beer. This is the second American strong ale that really made me take notice of the awesomeness of beer (the first being Rogue’s Dead Guy Ale) several years ago before I started to get all nerdy about beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

A: Dark iced-tea brown, cloudy, with a huge brown tinged head almost a finger long. The head sits on top and has great retention, and wonderful thick lacing is left as the beer is consumed.  S: Aggressive lemon and grapefruit hops, sweet malt, biscuit, slight smoke, slight sweet syrup.  T: Sweet malt, grapefruit, bread, caramel, and lots of bitter notes that cling to the tongue and throat.  M: Medium body and drier with smooth moments.  O: A solid strong ale that is, as it states, not for everyone. It has wonderful bitter flavor, but also has some sweet sugar notes that balance the beer. The head is wonderful, and the finish has great bite. However, it is not a beer to sit back and drink a six pack.

T: Caramel ridden body alongside some very slight roast notes. A little cream is present. Generally, it's a bit simply built. The nuts don't come through. It's not really well balanced, but it could be worse.  Mf: Pretty smooth and pretty wet. Doesn't really suit the flavours of the body.  Dr: Too difficult to drink for the ABV.

For some odd reason the dominant scent is straight up gummy bears. It's uncanny. Then there is a sour scent, slightly acidic and vinous. Malt lingering in the background, but gummy bears way up front. It makes me curious as to what kind of hops they used in this one. (website says ""CLASSIFIED"")  T: Huge caramel malt taste with heaps of hops, eventually the sweetness gives way to the copious amounts of flavor and bittering hops. The hops are pine all the way. Hugely resinous hops on the back of my tongue that stick like glue. Very bitter. Finishes quite dry, a little alcoholic, and slightly chalky.  M: Quite thick, oily, and viscous mouthfeel. Perfect amount of carbonation.  This beer packs a pine punch in the face with the most curious and enigmatic aroma I've come across. The aroma has almost nothing to do with the taste, but that just adds to the complexity of this fine ale. After drinking my first glass of this bomber, I feel like I can scrape hop resin off my tongue.

Roasted malt and pine dominate the nose.  Sweet maltiness up front that turns piney in the middle and ends creamy and bitter.  Been a while since I had this on tap, it used to be my go to beer when I was craving some hops and bitterness. I had this beer after an DIPA and it still had that awesome bitterness.

Has some decent balance, as roasted malts as well as aromatic hops both hit the nose.  Taste: Boozy and sweet fruit compote, but smooth and creamy. I pick up some caramel and it is on the sweet side up front but ends hoppy dry. This sat on my buddies shelf for at least 4 months I think the alcohol strength may have amped up.

Nose is big and hoppy, with juicy fruit and candied citrus leading the way. A solid caramel malt character holds everything up. There's an earthiness that, combined with the malt profile, reminds me of a German bock.  Rich and malty on the palate, supporting my initial thoughts of bock. Turns quickly into an almost acetic, acrid note, leading into a bruising and lingering bitterness. I'm taken aback at the overall similarity to a classic German bock, sip after sip, minus the hops. One would be hard pressed to mistake this for a bock, of course, but I can't overlook the similarities. There's a subtle note of citric juiciness, but otherwise the hops seem to lend themselves only to bitterness.  Quite thick and viscous, between soft and firm. Lingering bitterness diminishes drinkability, especially in a 22 oz. bottle. A good beer, but overrated in my opinion.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,gregsandiego,4.53,"This one of my personal favorites. The beer that weened me from fizzy Corona to a more sophisticated palate.  The taste is rich and strong. The flavors are complex combination of chocolate and spices. In contrast to Stone's IPA this one not bitter at all.  I best like it ice cold straight out of the bottle. The fact that they say ""you probably won't like it"" right on the bottle itself - is that reverse psychology or what?  In California they serve this on the Pacific Surfliners - the trains that go up and down the coast. That along with Stone's IPA.

This beer is a tawny red with a reddish cappuccino head. The lacing is fantastic. The nose has green tea aroma with toasty and caramel notes. The hops come on in the second half and leave a deep sprucey bitterness that lingers that draws you in for another drink. The mouthfeel is full and lush.

147,92,magictacosinus,4.38,"This was an pivotal beer for me that, as with many others, got me into craft brewing. This is a VERY proud beer for what it is, and based off of the bottle's amazing, memorable description, it shows! Poured into a Stone pint glass from a bomber.  Appearance: A beer with this name SHOULD have an appearance this intimidating and delectable. A darkened reddish amber tone with a thick, frothy head, there's plenty of carbonation to be seen here. One of coolest looking colors I've seen an ale contain.  Smell: Delicious, fruity malts with a sour yeasty smell and enough hops to add bitterness. It's definitely a slightly extreme smell, especially for newcomers to this beer style, but I suppose after drinking it for a while that I'm used to it by now.  Taste: There's really nothing quite like an AB. You initially get a strong, smoked malty flavor that is suddenly overpowered by an ambivalent booziness and strongly dried hoppiness that makes it sweet and bitter as all hell at the same time. There are no specific fruity esters that I can make out, but it's definitely bready.  Mouthfeel: Why buy usually sickening malt liquors when you can have strong ales like this?! It tastes way more like a 'malt' based beverage in flavor and density than any of the low end ones, and is far more complex in it's feel and flavor. It's bitter as all hell, but it's wonderfully thick and warming unlike any beer of this low price. Really intense, but very rewarding.  Overall: An excellent beer which supposedly makes me ""not worthy"" enough to give it a perfect 5! I treat it as a special delicacy, and would never consume it regularly due to its extreme, pleasurably antagonizing experience. It's incredible, but I would never introduce people to craft beer with AB. What I love about AB is how self-conscious it is of the fact that it's NOT for everyone. I totally am enamored with it, however, and am happy to see that it's available everywhere.

Poured from a 22oz bomber I picked up at Evergreen Liquors in Frederick, MD. Gladly paid around $6.00 as I have heard nothing but good things about this offering. The head was a gorgeous 3 fingers of sticky froth that lasted the entire time. Lacing was excellent as well.  Smell: I first noticed some clean hops with even stronger malts that seemed to create a well blended aroma. A roasted quality was lingering while I pulled my nose away. The complexity of this beer is already coming through.  Taste: The subtle hops hit first with roasted malts dominating most of the middle. The aftertaste lended itself to some toffee and a clean English maltiness. The hops were definitely not the predominant component in the palate. This brew is extremely complex, yet drinks real smooth. It probably took me over a dozen sips just to single out these basic notes.  This is a phenomenal beer. I plan to add a bottle to my beer cellar. I may even seek out the Oak Aged version.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,rundocrun,4.15,"Poured from a bomber into a snifter glass. No freshness date on the bottle, but there is a hilarious and long-winded description on the back complete with as many exaggerations and personifications as you can stand.  A - This beer pours a deep red-brown and glows a brilliant ruby color when held to a light. Has a finger of light tan head that sticks around for a few minutes and then fades to a thin film, leaving behind generous lacing on the sides of the glass.  S - Has an immediately noticeable estery presence. Hints of toasted bread and oh-so-miniscule amounts of coffee-like aroma. I also notice a spicy, herbal note reminiscent of belgian ale yeast. Many things going on here which makes me excited for what the flavor profile has in store.  T - Rich caramely sweetness up front. Mild fruity flavor from the esters detected in the nose. Sweetness rides from front to finish, but a definite hop bitterness joins into the fray toward the middle and balances things out. Along with the bitterness comes a slightly tart tang. In the finish there are definite notes of coffee-like bitterness and dark roasted grains along with sweet, dark fruits.  M - Medium-to-thick body with a slightly rough mouthfeel from the bitterness and the carbonation. This is definitely a challenging beer to define (as are most ales in the nebulous ""American Strong Ale"" category).  This ale is a shape-shifter from start to finish. It begins like a sweet syrupy old ale or scottish ale then takes a left-hand turn into IPA bitterness territory. This is quickly muddled by stormy clouds of stout roastiness, but the warm esters make a comeback in the end leaving the palate utterly dumbfounded, but somehow satisfied.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

No trace of the 7+% ABV in the aroma.  T: Thick, syrupy caramel malt leads the way with the piney hops providing some balance. Once again, the ABV is completely hidden.  M: Creamy, but with some prickly carbonation mixed in. Full mouthfeel with a drying finish. While this isn't what I would call an ""easy drinker"", the ABV is dangerously hidden and a bomber of this can sneak up on you quickly.  O: This is a thick, heavy brew that offers a substantial amount of flavor in every sip.

147,92,output01x,4.33,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle (Enjoy By 08/02/11) into a pint glass.  A moderate pour yields a 2-finger tan-colored head that slowly recedes to a thick, clumpy coating. The body is a transparent reddish amber with a decent amount of slowly rising carbonation bubbles. Thick lacing clings to the glass from start to finish.  Spicy hops and earthy malts make for a very pleasant aroma. Floral and citrusy, the hops are quite complex and offer a lot to the nose. The malt carries notes of sweetness and caramel. There is a lot going on in the aroma and all of it is good.  Just as complex as the nose, there is a multitude of flavors to analyze. Earthy and spicy at the start, the malt lends a breadiness that is quickly matched by dry floral hops. The flavors really merge together nicely and compliment each other in nearly every way. Every sip adds a different perspective to this beer depending on the attention you are giving the sip. Complex and interesting when you are analyzing it, but still full flavored and very palatable when you are distracted.  Medium bodied with good carbonation, this beer is very drinkable considering the explosiveness and fullness of the flavors. It coats your mouth well but does not become very sticky, allowing this beer to be slowly sipped or quickly drank.  I, like many BAs have a long history with this beer. When I was first getting into craft beer, I purchased this beer for name alone, not really knowing what I was getting into. I honestly drain poured my first bomber not because I didn't like it, but because it was too much for me. Since, I have had many run-ins with this beer, including trying it on tap, and I have quickly come to realize that I prefer this beer with a few months on it. Fresh is a little too hoppy in my opinion and I prefer to allow the hops to mellow slightly, allowing the malt to come through more. Personally, I prefer this beer right around its ""Best By"" date.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The taste is pretty good, you get a nice bready toffee malt taste (not as much caramel as I expected), followed by a complete mouth coating pine hop bitterness. Overall as allways a great product by stone, I usually buy the IPA because I like the citrus/grapefruit taste it has or the Oaked AB because I liked the added oak/vanilla flavor, but this one is an excellent beer and if stone didn't have so many other great beers, I'd get this much more.

147,92,Kinsman,4.48,"Arrongant Bastard, one of my first real introductions to the world of big and bold craft beers yet somehow I've never reviewed it.  Wonderful dark chestnut colored body with some ruby red highlights. Capped with a thick and frothy ecru shaded head that slowly slips down the edge of the glass to leave a thick, sticky lace behind.  Storng malt presence on the nose with lots of toffee and caramel notes paired well with an aggressive citrusy and slightly resiny hop aroma.  Malty biscuit backbone with a good bit of sweet caramel and slightly fruity flavors show off one half of this beer before the hops come along and take over. This hop profile exemplifies your typical American hop flavor with boat loads of grapefruit (and some of its closest citrus friends) as well as a floral and piney character. Finishes with a good bit of bitterness that helps balance out the sweetness of the malt.  Mouthfeel comes across as smooth and creamy with a thick full bodied feel.

147,92,AmericanGothic,4.2,"Poured from a bomber into a Sam Adams pint.  A: Pours a clear, dark copper orange with one finger of pale tan, billowy head. Good retention and lace.  S: Good dose of sweet malt with distinct citrus poking through.  T: Leads with the citrusy hops, but then the malt swells underneath with caramel and toffee, on the dry side (unlike the aromas) but not too much. Finish is long with the hops (now more pine than citrus) winning in the end.  M: Medium mouthfeel, pretty creamy, slight astringence.  O: I enjoyed this a lot, and would buy it often if only Stone would distribute in Iowa. Definitely one to seek out on the occasional road trip to Illinois.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,tdm168,4.47,"On tap at the Village Draft House in Raleigh  Arrived a deep amber with a very thin lacing of head. Smells malty with hops coming through. Taste is initially malty and slightly sweet, but quickly changes to a piney, floral hop characteristic. Very well hopped and very well balanced. As the beer warms the alcohol begins to come through in the nose and in the finish, but in a very complimentary way; adds further balance in the nose, meshing well with the malts and hops, and adds warmth to the finish adding to the overall balance. This beer is nicely carbonated and medium bodied; I actually thought it was quite light on the palate given the style and alcohol content.  Just another great beer from Stone. I have this beer several times a year, and I've never had a bad pour.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,huhl23,3.58,"This was one of my first ventures into craft beers. Before I discovered the IPA I was recommended to try Stone Pale Ale and this Arrogant Bastard. This is definitely not a pool beer, which I tried to make it at first. I was told later that to truly experience craft beers they should be drank out of a glass. So I did just that.  I can't say I love this beer but I can say that I liked it. It is pretty good, but almost peculiar at first taste. I detected a strong taste of grapefruit in this brew coming from the hops yet has a strong malty backbone to balance it out. It has a very nice appearance of caramel color brew with a 3 finger head that shrunk down but lasted to the last drop. Good beer but not something I'll seek out.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

There is a hint of the tobacco and some other spicy finish scents.  The taste is very hop forward. Citrus, pine, sweet weed resin, caramel, this beer has a lot going for it.

A very dark, heavy and hop-dominated beer. This is a very strong, hop-dominated brew and quite frankly, I am not worthy.

147,92,Bendurgin,3.84,Poured at Pigs Fly. Appears a dark hazelnut color with a thin beige head.  Lots of tropical fruits in the aroma. Pineapple and mango come to mind win hints of caramel adding a little bit of sweetness to round it out. Bitter piney hops take the forefront on the pallet. A lot of the fruit aroma is masked by simple bitterness. Still get the sweet caramel finish in the flavor though.  A bit sharp on the feel but a nnce light body. Overall it's pretty easy to see why people love this beer. It's unique but doesn't stray into the strange territory.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I almost gagged at the disgusting aftertaste of this beer. The appearance was fine, nothing to complain about...but everything else was simply 'awful'. I realize that BAers love the outrageous, extreme, in-your-face beers, but this is just nasty. Please stay away if you have any real taste.  Drainpour for me, and my lowest rating yet.

147,92,jmvecchio1,4.33,"The beer pours out brownish-red in color with a thick and heavy off-white head on top. The smell is slightly sweet - with tones of caramel malts and a slight pop of citrus hops underneath. The beer's taste is powerful and strong, but surprisingly well balanced and sneaky with regards to hiding it's ABV. At first taste the beer smacks you upfront with a strong citrus hop bite. Then you get pleasant sweet caramel and roasty - almost nutty - tones throughout the drink with a clean-dry finish on the swallow. There's a notable amount of hop oil which lingers on the tongue after the swallow, but it's not overpowering and balances the malt tones gracefully. Overall, the drink of Arrogant Bastard ale is outstanding.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,calise1122,2.59,"Man, It really has been far too long since I’ve had the beer. Like I said before – I got a bit annoyed from their beers a few years back and sort of stopped buying them. Not in any boycott or shit like that, just fell off my grocery list.  Anyway, I let the bomber get a little closer to room temp and poured into a skinny tulip. It pours a dark, mahogany brown with a frothy sweat stained white head that pours a few fingers thick and then dimples and craters quickly on the surface, but holds on tight to the sides of the glass leaving a nice lacing. 3 minutes go by and the head settles down to a nice foamy surface about a half inch thick with rings sticking around up north.  For a dark brown ale, it is crystal clear. Very filtered and I can almost make out Aceves’s beer gut through the glass if I hold still long enough. Held up to the light, you get a little coca cola ruby red/brown at the base of the glass. Nice looking beer – certainly looks like a strong ale.  Haven’t smelt this beer in a long time, but oddly enough it smells the same, familiar. A weird smell I think – very bitter, very hoppy… but the pine aroma is supported by the foundation of grain, caramel, toffee aroma beneath it.  Maybe it’s because I just had a DIPA… but I think it has a pretty “watery” mouthfeel compared to last time I had it. It finishes sticky enough… but I feel like it may have been “thicker” in my memory. Taste? Boozy, hoppy, grainy, chewy caramel – but a lack of balance if you ask me. The hops smack you around a bit with grapefruit/citrus… but its not that great citrus flavor that you cherish in a really well balanced and appropriately hopped beer. Just swinging its big grapefruit dick around with no abandon... I guess that's what an Arrogant Bastard does.  Wouldn’t say I’d get this again soon. I like a beer that is balanced – even when its high alcohol. There are plenty of 7+ ABV beers that are fantastically balanced… but this unfortunately (in my opinion) is not one of them. It doesn’t have much flow to it if that makes any sense… starts a bit watery in mouthfeel, ends very sticky. Starts out way to hoppy – filled with grapefruit.. ends with a not so great burnt caramel flavor. Awkward more than Arrogant... and I like big ass, hoppy, aggressive beers...  But it did look really nice.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Some lacing sticks to the glass, a good cap sits behind as the head dissipates.  Smells quite honestly like B.O. Wow this is a new one for me. Maybe its skunked but I'm not sure based based on the age, usually the born date is three months before the best by date. This also smells fruity, citrusy, carmel, piney, dank hoppy ness.  Taste blends quite well, piney, Carmel, citrus, juicy oranges.  Mouthfeel is medium. Medium carbonation. The finish is quite a bit of lingering piney, resinous coating oily hops.

147,92,tjsmith910,3.24,"This beer has thrown me for a loop. I tried it because of a TV show. I liked the name and the brewing company seemed like they were aiming for perfection which for an american ale I think they are damn close. The Bottle reads as follows:  This is an aggressive ale. You probably won’t like it. It is quite doubtful that you have the taste or sophistication to be able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth. We would suggest that you stick to safer and more familiar territory–maybe something with a multi-million dollar ad campaign aimed at convincing you it’s made in a little brewery, or one that implies that their tasteless fizzy yellow beverage will give you more sex appeal. Perhaps you think multi-million dollar ad campaigns make things taste better. Perhaps you’re mouthing your words as you read this.  At Stone Brewing, we believe that pandering to the lowest common denominator represents the height of tyranny - a virtual form of keeping the consumer barefoot and stupid. Brought forth upon an unsuspecting public in 1997, Arrogant Bastard Ale openly challenged the tyrannical overlords who were brazenly attempting to keep Americans chained in the shackles of poor taste. As the progenitor of its style, Arrogant Bastard Ale has reveled in its unprecedented and uncompromising celebration of intensity. There have been many nods to Arrogant Bastard Ale…even outright attempts to copy it… but only one can ever embody the true nature of liquid Arrogance!  A - absolutely beautiful deep red and brown look  S - I rate all beers a 3 because I have no sense of smell  T - HOPS...lots of HOPS  M - Warming feeling in pit of stomach.

Lots of strong hops in the aroma, rough around the edges, with notes of toasted grains and malts, and hints of dark fruits. Taste is complex; strong with pine hops, woody, bitter, biting, with toasted caramel malts, and notes of resin, raisins, tobacco, molasses, and coffee. Alcohol presence is noticeable.

Again, hops and an unpleasant piney aftertaste that lingers far too long. Not much balance here, unfortunately.  M - Quite a bit of hop aggressiveness. Some carbonation gives the hops more bite. The feel does improve as the beer warms and loses the carbonation, however.  Summary - I've been wanting to try this brew for a while.

Smell: holy Chinook hops. Light caramel and dark fruit, but mostly the aggressive aromas of Chinook; grapefruit and resin.  Taste: follows the nose with a fairly harsh hop attack; citrus and pine beating my tastebuds down. Caramel, bread, and brown sugar are there too but too weak to balance anything out.  Feel: medium bodied, moderate carbonation, alcohol hidden. Not something you'd wanna session; it overwhelms my palate so it isn't something I would get a second glass of.

The hop character of this beer is very good. The other tastes were of some caramel malts that gave is a slight sweetness and a light wooden flavor too. The mouthfeel is medium and had a good drinkablity to it. Overall, I think this beer is a classic in it's own way. As long as Stone makes this beer I don't see them going out of business anytime soon. It's a beerthat's got the balls to stand up against all the others out there and say ""I'm better than you"".",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,CFHMagnet,4.48,"Poured this Bastard into a mug. A. Beautiful beer. Two fingers of nice foamy head that sits there indefinitely. Nice lacing too.  S. Citrus, especially grapefruit, strong caramel malt (yum!), floral scents. Hints of dark fruit.  T. Hops hit you in the face when you take a sip. Pine and citrus, they fade into a decent roasted malt flavor that you enjoy rather than get smacked with, then it ends up with a bitter biscuity taste.  M. Medium bodied, this bad boy coats the mouth well. The bitter biscuit flavor builds up and definitely stays with you. Doesn't dry too much though.  O. This is an amazing beer. It was one of the beers that helped me out on the road from macro to micro brew, and has earned a special place in my heart.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,andrewinski1,4,"Poured into a tulip. Nice foamy head leaves sticky lacing atop a dark amber body.  The aroma is full of sweet mango. The hops blend nicely with the sweet malt in the aroma.  The taste starts out with sweet tangy malt. The hops are flavorful and bitter leaving slightly spicy citrus flavor. The aftertaste is distinctly bitter and harsh but seemingly appropriate for this beer.  This beer is light bodied considering the ABV making it more drinkable. Served cool enough, this could be refreshing.  Really tasty, a sweeter alternative to Stone's IPA's.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

About a one finger goldeny/yellow head sits atop an enticing burnt orange to amber body. Fairly clear, but it was slightly dark where I was sitting to really see how the light shined throufh.  Smell: This beer is so much better freah than from the bottle, the smell is fresh citrus, strongly bitter grapefruit, faintly earthy. I feel like the bottled version is unable to convey the same hop/citrus bouquet that a fresh tap can.  Taste: As this cool amber liquid passes the borders of my taste department, I am hit by a bitter/citrus hop bomb followed by a phenolic alcohol greeting. Medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Above average mouthfeel with a mildly dry finish. I drink this fairly often, and it never becomes old; this IS my Coors Light.

The noticeable alcohol integrates really well to create spiciness on the palate.  M: Quite thick with a lot of carbonation which emphasises the bitterness.  O: I can tell this is a high quality beer. It also surprises me with its Englishness. Really not what I expected from such a high profile US beer.

A roasty nose, caramel and some honey.  First mouthful tasted heavenly. Creamy and sweet, reminds me so much of a double! Then, the hops start coming in. Wow. Dry hoppy finish.

Smells like tons of hops- primarily pine along some fresh cut grass, grapefruit and booze. I am getting a grassy smell as well.  Tastes like tons of hops. Definitely aggressive and in your face. Tastes similar to chewing on pine needles with lots of hop resin. There is also some grapefruit rind and booze. There does seem to be a malt backbone in this beer as well. I am tasting something similar to toasted bread which must be toasted malt but the flavor is predominantly aggressive hops.  This is a medium bodied beer with a nice amount of carbonation. This beer is creamy and sticky from all the hop resin. The finish leaves a lingering bitterness.  This is a nice hoppy American Strong Ale. The flavors are very aggressive and in your face.

There are plenty of tastes which coming through at different stages. Initially a rich caramel malt taste and dark fruit which stays through to the middle where a bitterness begins to appear and build up to a massive finish with a lot of bitter citrus hops and a tang of alcohol but the richness of the initial malt is still in there. The bitterness stays at the back of the mouth for a long, long time. Very well balanced.  Mouthfeel A medium carbonation and a medium-heavy silky body which really clings to your mouth.  Overall A deliciously strong, rich and complex beer which really delivers a lot of taste and aroma. Even better, it comes in a huge bottle!

I didn't really check for clarity because this beer just isn't much to look at. It's gotta be said that it isn't pretty. It looks the way it's supposed to, I guess. Imposing.  Smell - Strangely, I never seem to get a lot of aroma from AB. I get the hops first. Mostly grapefruit. Maybe a bit floral. Behind that I get roasted malts with some caramel. It's not a strong or complex aroma.  Taste - This is where the goodness is. I get just a bit of grapefruit hop at the start, followed by some malt. Caramel malt, but not sweet. The bitter finish is when I love and what steers the feeble drinkers away. The bitterness lasts and lasts until you take another sip to get just enough malt for a brief reprieve.  Mouthfeel - Well carbonated. Enough body to help the malt flavor linger until the finish. Not syrupy, though.  Overall - It defies comparison and it's a beer that grows on you.

Taste- Toasted and caramelized malts lead things off. Notes of molasses and dark fruits as well. Slightly floral with a strong citrus hop finish, particularly grapefruit. Very nice balance in this brew.  Mouthfeel- Creamy and smooth, with medium full body and carbonation. Ever so slight alcohol warming.

Sweet malt with a light twang of grapefruit and the bitterness of it's peel. Caramelly, with a hint of coffee. Much more roasted malt in the taste than was evident in the nose.  Medium-bodied with a light prickle. Syrupy enough to hold all that superb flavor on the tongue.  I actually prefer this to the oaked version. The oak, while good, had a bit of harshness to it.

Pour: One of the most beautiful, deep but clear ruby colored pours I've seen. Nice 2 finger, off-white head with nice lacing.  Nose: Sweet and floral, just as I've come to expect from hoppy beers. Hint of grapefruit. Not getting a whole lot else from it.  Taste: Holy grapefruit, Batman! This beer is long on citrus for sure.

From the smoothness of the middle to the finish, it's not hard to tell that this is a very nicely crafted brew. That said, I do think it's completely over the top.

T: The first time I had it was on tap at The Pub in Las Vegas and I didn't care for it since I felt it was too overpowering. However, this time I'm really digging it. Maybe because since then I've been on a Double IPA kick so my palate can handle it better. Just like the smell, it does have a sweet flavor but not one that is cloying. There is also a pine hoppy flavor which is a bit less subtle than its brother, Stone IPA.  M: Smooth with a slight tingle on the tongue.

Big pine aroma with some sweet fruity malt beneath.  Citrus/pine hops take hold midway largely dominate the flavor, but there's also a sweet, lightly roasted malt flavor beneath. But not caramel--I can pick out some dark fruit aspects, like figs and raisins and what not. An interesting mix. More like a doppelbock IPA than a black IPA, if you had to classify it as an IPA.  Mouthfeel is right down the middle medium.  I remember when this was one of the ""strongest"" tasting beers I've had. It's not anymore, but it's really a good beer I don't drink often enough.

Malty, hoppy and crisp. Very gratifying.  T: The floral taste was the most vigorous to my palate. It subsided to a toasty-hoppy flavor and then further to a pleasant bitterness. I think this is due to the malts hiding in the background, which definitely render the taste balanced.  M: Smooth and medium bodied. Carbonation was prime.

Generally double I.P.A.'s I've tried have had a powerful grapefruit characteristic.

Don't think this is the kind of beer that a bud or miller drinker would enjoy. But, if you love craft beer, it belongs in a category of it's own.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,secondtooth,4.32,"Pours a murky red-brown, with a thick head and equally thick lace.  Aroma is nice - I get some fruit, berries, and bread. Friendly so far.  First sip dispels that notion of ""friendly"". It's bitter, with some sting. Definitely some roasted malts in there, and a boat-load of hops as well.  This one is, as the name states, a bruiser of a beer. Strong and potent. Enjoyable, but watch out as this one sneaks up on you!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,EricCioe,4,"This pours something like congealed blood with a one finger head that dies down gradually leaving a little lace. On the nose there is a giant, fresh pine aroma. Backing that up is just a bit of fresh citrus riding atop a big malt backbone of caramel, which was much bigger than I expected. In the mouth there is no doubt that the pine is center stage, but there is some slightly sweet caramel that makes this brew something more than just a hop bomb. The body is pretty viscous with the long finish being a mixture of sweetness up front, and bitterness that lingers a little longer. There is a little bit of an alcohol presence here, no knock in my book.  Overall, this is a really nice brew. In the past I've wondered why they don't just call it a big amber, but this time I really noticed the caramel malts backing up the bitterness, providing a little more depth than normal for an amber.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,david18,4,"Below is my bottle review:  Been drinking this one for years but just started posting reviews. The quintessential strong beer from which the others are judged. This is really the only strong dark beer with as much hops as it has. Like a low alcohol hoppy barleywine, this one has become so popular that I almost never get it anymore. Since it's so available, I'm always looking for more obscure things to drink. However this is a great one to go back to and a good gateway beer for someone looking for some real adventure.  This is also my goto draft beer and I enjoy it all the time. The only problem is that it tends to ruin my palate for anything else, but it's not a terrible thing if I have to commit to Arrogant Bastard for the night.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Rschis16,4.05,"Looks pretty, beautiful fluffy 3-finger white head on top of a dark burnt orange ale. Some serious lacing on the glass. Smells of some deep resiny hops and some burnt toasted malts in there as well.  Well hops obviously, especially in the finish. Up front there's are some burnt malts. This is a very intense brew with bold flavors of strongly bitter, resinous hops and roasty malts. That said, its very well balanced between the two. More booziness comes out as it warms up and the flavors all become magnified but somehow less intense. The mouthfeel is creamy and very full-bodied.  All in all this beer is very quality, but maybe not for everyday drinking. It's not the most refreshing beer I've had but I think this would be perfect for a fall night after a hard day. Good stuff, great beer for a hophead.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,bravejoejoe,4.56,"Appearance - Deep amber color, nice 1 finger head. As the head retreats there is a nice lacing on the side of the glass.

S - Hops, malts, pine and citrus.  T - Big malt flavor which seems to be cut by a bit of sweetness possible from some caramels and chocolate. Nice balancing there. Some dark fruit as well. Finishes bitter at the end.  M - Medium bodied. Good solid carbonation. Bit of the alcohol burn at the end.  O - Good solid Stone offering. Nicce drinker.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,CrookedStill,4.45,"Pours deep mahogany with a one/two finger off-white head that slowly falls.  Piny hops upfront and by far the most dominate aroma in front of a nice caramel malt backbone.  Right away the pine hops bite (chinook?). Sharp bitterness that's balanced perfectly against a caramel sweetness. Taste like a well rounded IPA (better, in fact, than many other beers labeled IPA). The bitterness lingers but isn't overpowering and finishes dry. There's a simplicity that really works here.  Medium bodied with a mild about of carbonation. Everything here really compliments the flavor of the beer.  This is an amazing beer. I mentioned above the simplicity with this beer and it really is fairly straight forward. A lot of pine bite against a strong caramel sweetness and wrapped in what has to be one of the best looking beers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,OrangeAmps,4,"consumed from a bomber into a pint glass.  This beer is pretty great. Over the top and abrasive hops with just enough malt to back it up. its Not for everyone, especially not for those who cant deal with bitterness in general. There is a lot of activity happening in terms of taste, moreso than on the nose.  I definitely prefer this one to the oaked AB, which was way too aggressive and rough for my poor virgin mouth.  Dig it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Nugganooch,3.93,"Awww man! Crackin one of these takes me back to my College days over 10 years now. Amazing!  Well bombs away!  A: Appearance is a deep lush amber color with awesome clarity and some rich mahogany undertones that really redden in the light. Nice tight fitting cap of a dirty tan head and loads of lace.  S: Smells of light roasty malts and yeasty breads that give way to a nice piney and floral hop aroma.  T: Warm roasty malts, caramel, slightly nutty, rich bread flavors are balanced very nicely by a sharp hop bitterness that brings a nice peppery spice and earthiness to the beer. It really lends itself to oak well and I think the oaked version is in fact even better. Bitterness dries out the finish and it definitely warms up a bit for sure. A brew like nothing else out there really. I mean maybe Rogue DeadGuy comes close but this is way hoppier.  M: Incredibly smooth and creamy with a slight richness to it that clings to the palate.  D: Decent really. I am tempted to sip on this one but the body is so smooth it is proving to be difficult. If you are in to big beers with big flavors I would highly recommend.  To me the AB is a definite pioneer in the craft brew industry and Stonebrew would not be who they are with out it. Flagship really. I mean what do you even label it...An American Strong? An Imperial Amber? An AltAle lol. I can totally see this brew as being offensive to the loyal BMC drinker. I have even tested this theory with friends in fact. Big fan. I love homebrewing the clone and have had amazing success. Even further surprised by the simplicity of the recipe but it all really comes together nicely.

147,92,harrymel,4.18,"Bb: 06.28.11  A: Pours a dark brown, when held to the light, a toasted orange. Excellent clarity. Less than single finger of toasted peanut head which falls quickly leaving a sheet of the same. Spotty lacing.  S: Piney, resiny hop profile. I take a couple deep breaths and the sweet malty backbone comes through. Brown sugar, candi sugar.  T: Bitter, arrogantly bitter. Nicely balanced. I know they label this as an American strong ale, but it reminds me of a balls-deep amber with the capacity to satisfy and challange the palate. I rarely skip over the actual adjectives and tote the skill in formation. Pine, bitter, amber, sweet, tea-like hops.  M: medium to heavy body with low to medium carbonation. Slicks the palate ever so lightly.  O: Outstanding beer. 'Nuff said.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Mozz74,5,"I have passed this beer for a year now but today I decided I wanted sometrhing different. I love Stone and usually drink the IPA. I was ver surprised when I took my first sip! Instant 5 out of 5 stars!!! Taste does not always reflect color! Very Fresh Taste, crisper than I thought.

147,92,AlCaponeJunior,4.03,"Amber-brown in color, slightly cloudy, very nice slightly tan two finger head with staying power, eventually dropping into a sheen, leaving great lacing.  Smell is a nice combination of hops, malts, fruits and citrus aromas.  Taste is bold and strong, with a strong citrus and hop character, and an equally strong malt character, combined with a nice fruitiness, making for a nice balance of flavors. Quite bitter, yet incredibly smooth.  There's a slightly IPA like quality to this beer, with the big body and heavy bitterness, and the fruity hops qualities, which linger on for a while.  It's typically stone in that it's great stuff, as expected. Arrogant Bastard doesn't disappoint at all. A real value at the price too.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,TheStig,3.95,"Served on tap at Hard Times Cafe. Brought to my table in a large glass, so I couldn't see *how* it poured, but it was a magnificent deep amber, almost opaque. The head was almost gone by the time it reached me, but as I drank, it left persistent, thick and strong lacing on the glass. Being that this was a bar and the aroma of chili, cigarette smoke and Bro sweat was heavy around me, I couldn't really pick out any notable scents from the beer. Taste, however, is as advertised: hoppy like you wouldn't believe. Don't think of this as an idiotic, amateurish experiment in making ""hop tea"", however-- there's a stunning amount of complexity to this beer, and that becomes apparent from the first sweet bananna-bread notes to hit your palate. The taste develops an understated citrus taste that lingers until the hops hit. The bitterness is actually rather pleasant, and leaves the palate with the same sensation one feels after having exceptionally strong coffee. Mouthfeel is very smooth with just enough carbonation to allow different flavors to play in different parts of the mouth.  Delightful, and goes well with a bowl of chili.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ggilman,3.93,"A muddled mahogany deep brown with very little clarity. The color eats into the head, a tan foamy 1 finger that sticks around, and to the sides of the glass. A sweet fruity caramel malty nose, same in flavor. Maybe a little raisin, or date. Smoky tobacco, slight bitterness. A taste of alcohol reminds you that its a strong ale. The faint taste of diacetyl, but I'm hypersensitive to it. Smooth creamy mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation. A good beer, love the oaked bottle I had recently, so I'm questioning the freshness of this particular pour. I'll seek it out as soon as I can to compare.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The beer itself looks similiar to iced tea, but with visible carbonation. The smell is of hops, carmel, and just a touch of malt at the end. Also another smell i cant determine...maybe cotton candy? The taste is strong, but smooth. Heavy, yet balanced. Hops and bitterness take the lead followed closely by a touch of alcohol and a slight candied sweetness.

147,92,BarryMFBurton,4.23,"I've had a lot of Arrogant Bastard in the past. At first, before I really had a taste for hops, it struck me as an overbearing beer. Now that I'm more experienced, it has become one of my favorite go-to's. And now that I finally found it on-tap (at Chumley's in Lafayette, IN), I am in heaven.  Poured into a badass chalice.  A: A bit of a sloppy pour, but hey, still looks nice. Deep, dark red body with most of the head poured off. What's left is thick and off-white with creamy, sticky lacing.  S: Hops are strong, strong, strong! Lots of sweetness abounds in the nose - grapefruit and apples come to mind. Behind all the boldness, you can tell there's complexity in the body.  T: There's that beautiful, burning hop bitterness I know and love! This is a hophead's dream. The grains are present - wheaty and sweet. However, they come off as faded/lackluster after a while. The fruits nearly disappear behind the hops, but lemon zest and grapefruit stick out the most. It's upfront; and it's great.  M: The bubbly carbonation serves to expand the palate. It adds a lightness that counteracts the heavy flavors of the body; typical for Stone. A very drinkable brew.  O: This is a perfect example of how simple ingredients can become great, complex beer. I'm just glad Stone has the guts to make such aggressive brews; it makes the beer world a more interesting place!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,liamt07,4.38,"Bottle from Whole Foods Union Square. 22oz into a tulip, best before June 6, 2011.  Pours a dark mahogany, huge dense cream coloured head. Super thick and creamy. Leaves a helluva lot of lace. Medium retention. Nose is hopped to high heaven, lots of tropical notes with a sturdy malt base to support it. Taste kicks off with a blast of hops and massive malt backbone. Citrus and tropical notes contend with and intense bitterness imparted by the alpha acids. Huge caramel toffee base giving this loads of body. An interesting cinnamon spiciness comes out here as it warms, along with some dark tea flavours. Great bitterness here and a full, hefty feel. A suggestion of the alcohol is made, but that only adds to how good this was. An off center imperial red, methinks...",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Poured a 22oz double deuce into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a deep amber with a great 3 inch head that leaves seriously sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is hoppy up front. Nice notes of citrus and pine mixed with toffee and caramel with just a bit of biscuit and toast. As it warms the pine really starts drowning out everything else. Almost like blowing your nose with a pine branch. The flavor actually has a lot more malt then the nose would have led you to believe. Nice caramel and toffee notes with just a bit of burnt toast. Piny hopes help balance out the malt. Just a bit of booze and a hint of a medicinal hop bitterness at the tail of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is nice and crisp, leaving a nice dryness on the palate.

147,92,DCon,4.23,"Enjoyed on-tap @ the Wolf Public House for the last week and now getting time to review this awesome Strong Ale I've sampled over 4 times since Tuesday when Stone Brewing hit Missouri. Poured into a Pint Glass and has date on Keg saying ""Kegged On: 3-25-11"".  Appearance- Pours a Semi-Clear Amber color with Off White 1.5 Fingers of head. Has Great retention and also a Thick lace that leaves rings all the way down the glass! Great!  Smell- Has a sweet pale ale smell, also lots of maltiness with a roasted stout characteristic in the background. There are also hints of wood and raisin.  Taste- Once again, has this toasty smell in the drink but also has a plum/raisin finish. Very hoppy and has a fruit taste throughout the whole experience. Can really appreciate this beer!  Mouthfeel- Medium-bodied, Good carbonation (Medium), and a Warming feel afterwards.  Overall- This is an extremely hoppy Strong Ale when it comes down to it but have had stronger ales than this one. Can only enjoy 2 in one night but a great ""go-to"" ale when the night is young or at times when you need an extra kick to your glass. Have been selling the shit out of this beer this week and plan on continuing to support Greg Koch and all of his great ales!

147,92,longbongsilver,4.13,"Just wanted to see what all the fuss was about, finally saw this locally.  Reddish-brown on pouring, hollow off-white head of about 2 inches that sticks around quite awhile. Smell is pine & honey w/ a whiff of...cinnamon?  Drinks more mellow than I expected, with what comes from the scent joined by some nutty toasted notes. Kinda comes off to me like a cross between an IPA and a strong red ale. Starts off thin at first, but seems to thicken up as it warms a bit.  For something that practically screams on the bottle ""this probably isn't for you!!"", it sure comes off ridiculously sessionable. But maybe it's reverse psychology that makes it truly arrogant: make something virtually anybody would enjoy, and then taunt them not to drink it. I'd gladly have a couple of this on-tap if offered.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

T&M: Taste is very well balanced between hops and malts. Hops hit you up front but the malts balance it and keep too much bitterness from coming through until the aftertaste. Leaves a dry aftertaste.

Decent lacing as well.  the smell is very intense. citrusy hop aromas. a little along the lines of grapefruit...but there's certainly an orangey quality to it. Sharp alcohol aroma coming through on the back end.  the taste is just as intense as the smell. sweet up front, a hop assault as soon as it hits the back of the tongue. quite bitter indeed. there's a bit of an alcohol presence, as well as a very minimal roasted malt flavor. there's a huge presence of caramel. this is one complex beer...every sip you take contains a new element of flavor.  the mouthfeel is nice and rich. a medium, almost full body. the carbonation is pretty light.  it's not an intensely boozy beer, but you can certainly tell this beer is huge. i like it a lot, but i'm used to beers that are slightly less bitter. one of the most complex beers i've had. so intense, but i think i can tame it. edit - by the end of the bomber, the edge has worn off of the bitterness and it's a lot more enjoyable. my palate has probably just gotten a lot more used to it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,MaltsOfGlory,4.06,"Pours a hefty two finger head, the head is very close to white, but not quite. The head is retaining itself very well, not going anywhere so far. It looks very frothy too, lots of small bubbles, a few big ones. The body has a deep red color, with hints of brown, it's barely see through, for the most part it's cloudy and you cannot see through it at all, but at some points you can. This beer looks very good, the head is still there!!! Wow. On one hand this beer smells very standard, just a hoppy ale, with some malt and not much else. However, there is a very lively feeling to it, I don't necessarily pick up fruit on the nose, but I just feel like it's going to be there. It's a weird feeling, because it's a unique smell, but I can't quite distinguish what's so unique about it. One thing is for sure, it smells hoppy and intriguing. Interesting taste, not as hoppy as I thought it would be on the smell. The malts are also a lot more noticeable. There may be some hints of fruit in here, but they are very very small. It tastes very standard, but at the same time it's a very unique standard, it's hard to explain, but for sure a unique taste, even if it is very subtle. The mouthfeel is pretty damn good, it's not huge, but it's pretty substantial for what a strong ale should be, and on some sips you get some creaminess from the head (which is still there btw) which is very nice. Drinkability isn't too bad either, like I said the hops aren't as present as I thought they would be, which is a little disappointing, but it makes for a smoother, more balance drinking. Overall, this is a very solid beer. I would call it a unique beer, but in very subtle ways, it's not the craziest beer out there, but it has a nice personality too it, and it is of course well crafted, I say of course because Stone makes good beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,bobhits,4.53,"Arrogant Bastard is an odd beer to qualify. It isn’t an IPA but it sure has enough hops to call itself one. The look is of the deepest darkest red amber hue, with a solid 2 inch head that takes on a dirty dark cream color, leaving layers of lacing down the glass. Good, but not great clarity and not much carbonation in the glass.  Citrus hops and a chocolate and caramel malt. Some toasted and roasted aromas all blending into simple perfection.  I first had this beer when I was 21, it was amazing then. 5 years later and I truly wonder if there are 20 beers I’d rather have. I have no idea what the style is. I have no idea of what else compares to it. Citrus American hops attack the pallet. The malt is a mix of caramel, roasted chocolate, smoke, and perhaps just a touch of fruit. To say this is intense is an understatement to say the least.  This beer bites and that is the point! It’s just an amazing treat on the tongue, from the creamy head, strong alcohol, thick almost candy like body.  The first time I tried to buy beer I was told to try this and I asked if it was any good after reading the label. “Well, the labels right, odds are you won’t like it.” I put the bottle down and I bought something else.

147,92,Phelps,3.88,"Enjoyed on tap at the Mellow Mushroom, poured into a shaker pint.  Dark burgundy in color, with notes of burnt orange. Shadowy enough to almost completely obscure my fingers behind the glass. A frothy half-finger light tan head becomes a medium, fluffy ring. 4  The nose: caramel, toasty bread and nuts, orange, pine and grapefruit peel. It’s big, abrasive and arrogant for sure, but a little rough for me. 3.5  The flavor mirrors the nose pretty well: toasty bread, caramel, peanuts. It’s lightly sweet, and balanced by intense grapefruity, piney, heavily bitter hops. A powerful flavor, but in good balance. Alcohol emerges as the beer warms.  Prickly medium carbonation, lightly fizzy, with a hefty, kind of syrupy medium body. Smooth on the tongue, but bit hot. Pretty bitter, yet it finishes crisp.  Arrogant Bastard is an egotistical, condescending asshole of a beer, but like they say: it’s hard to be humble when you know you’re great.

Bouquet is a real big hoppy floral sense it seems. Very garden smelling. Not so much malt on this it seems.  Taste is thick and spiced hop but a big body that mutes the bitterness.

Appearance: Pours a very nice maroon color with ruby and orange accents and a 1-finger tan frothy head. Moderate retention with a decent amount of flat patchy lacing.  Smell: Smells kind of like a DIPA. I get strong citrus and tropical fruits from the hops and a caramel like sweetness from the malt. Unique yet familiar.  Taste: Malt sweetness up front then bitter earthy hops take front stage and don't really let anything else that may be present sneak through. Some dark and tropical fruit sweetness counter the hops, but it finishes mostly bitter.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is medium and smooth with a medium carbonation.  Drinkability: High  I didn't especially care for this one to start out, but towards the end of the bomber I was loving it. Note: as the beer warms the malt really starts to show it's true colors, so I would recommend letting it sit out at room temperature a bit before consuming if you want a more balanced beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Smell: Sweet mixture of toasty malt, caramel, floral hops, and citrus. Aroma is a lot milder than I expected.  Taste: Strong toasty malts balanced by moderate citrus and pine hop flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium body and carbonation.  Overall: A very nice blend of sweetness and bitterness. I think the description on the bottle is a little misleading as it makes it sound like this a hopbomb like a DIPA. The bitterness is mild enough for someone who isn't a hophead to enjoy. Overall a very solid brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,plfahey,4.04,"22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance-Deep mahogany ruby red, with brilliant clarity. Tall light tan head has good retention and great lacing.Looks lovely.  Aroma-Somewhat softer than what I expected-grain, caramel, biscuit, and toasty malt all make an appearance, along with light grassy, floral, and herbal hops. Smells nice, but I'm not blown away.  Flavor-Fairly high malt flavors of biscuit and toast are quickly swept up by moderately high hop bitterness and resiny, piney hop flavors, before being quenched by a bit of alcohol and more hop bitterness. It finishes quite dry, with sticky hop bitterness and a slight resiny flavor lingering on.  Mouthfeel-Medium full body, medium to medium high carbonation. Silky smooth and slightly mouth coating in a very pleasant way. There is some alcohol warmth, and even though the beer finishes quite bitter, there is no astringency from the hops.  Definitely good, though I'm not blown away by the flavor or the aroma. The aroma is a little light, and the bittering hops in the flavor just kinda come in and smack my tongue around. That said, it is quite smooth, moderately complex, and rather easy drinking for a beer with this much alcohol and bitterness.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Complex hopiness mixed with caramel and sweet malt and rounded out with some great fruity esters.  T - Great taste too. This thing sits the line between IPA and cascadian I think. Citrus hops abound, with some pine too. Caramel sweetness in the malt adds the perfect balance. Great drinker and already feeling the warming.  M - Puckering bitterness but otherwise perfectly smooth.  O - Great beer. Beer is good enough to deserve a 5 somewhere, but since it's just all around solid, I'll put it here.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Lacing was good down the glass sides.  Aromas are very strong hops, with pronounced citrus notes and a floral quality as well. The alcohol also is evident in the nose.  Taste is a big, bold and complex thing. The alcohol makes itself known, as well does the powerful hop bitterness. There is some malt sweetness, but the hops seem to overpower the malts. Crisp beer that seemed to mellow (just a little) as it warmed.  The aftertaste is bitter, but does offer some sweetness in the finish. The body is medium and carbonation high.

147,92,BeardedRiker,4.33,"Is there ever a time to be an arrogant bastard? I think today, my birthday, is as good of a time as any. And what better day to be an arrogant bastard AND drink an Arrogant Bastard. I'm not worthy? Well screw you, Stone. I AM worthy today. I've lived a mere 25 years but have only truly began to enjoy beer for a few. I remember the first time I drank the legend known as Arrogant Bastard. I was a mere amateur beer drinker, though at that time I still disliked light beers, and ordered the Arrogant Bastard just because of its name. I am willing to bet that many people who don't have the beer recommended to them get it for the same reason. What young and arrogant beer drinker doesn't want to order an Arrogant Bastard just because of the name? But oh, I was not worthy of it back then. I found it too bitter and too insane. It bombarded my taste buds with its hoppiness and flavor. I couldn't handle it! But today, today is a different day. Today I am older, wiser, and a much more worthy beer drinker. Today I will finally sit down with Arrogant Bastard and give it its due. Perhaps I am still not worthy of its glorious flavors, but it does deserve a proper review from me.  Arrogant Bastard is one of those beers that has you enamored with it as soon as it fills your glass. It's like seeing a woman that has your jaw dropping even by first glance and you the rest will be even better. OK, sorry for that creepy analogy. This bastard of a beer looks brown under dim light but if you put it up to a light you see how beautiful it is, like a red ruby, though it is bronze too. Little pearls of carbonation float their way to the top where the head forms gloriously. Seriously, I love the head on Arrogant Bastard. It looks so good it's screaming, ""Look how Goddamn good I look! I look so freaking good that you're not worthy of drinking me. I mean, seriously, I'm a Goddamn masterpiece!"" Well, I can't really argue with that. The head forms perfectly to where you can have it rise and inch or two above the top of the glass. It's a wonderful site. It is extremely frothy, tan, and fizzles away very slowly. The lacing it leaves when drinking the brew is a nice sight too.   You can smell Arrogant Bastard a few feet away after pouring it out. It's definitely very sweet, like toffee. The hops are earthy and don't smell as floral as many other hoppy beers do. But since this isn't pale ale, that's not a negative. There is a lot of maltiness in there too that adds a bit of breadiness. This beer doesn't smell too pine tree like...but it does remind me a bit of Lagnitas', and I hate to compare them, Wilco Tango Foxtrot beer in that they smell like a coniferous forest in a way. I could say there is some mango-citrus in there too but it's not very prominent.  But how arrogant and how bastardly does the Arrogant Bastard taste? It is sweet, earthy, and smooth. Definitely drink this at a warmer temperature or you'll end up just tasting a lot of hops and not much else. Right off you get a well-balanced punch of bitterness from the hops that is balanced with a lot of sweetness. It's not too sweet, though. The malts add smoothness to it and contribute the caramel-like sweetness, as well as the coniferous forest flavors that linger on into the finish. The mango-citrus makes a brief appearance in the hops and sweetness in the beginning and towards the middle. I guess if you don't like sweet beers then you might not prefer the Arrogant Bastard but this is a damn good strong ale that is well-balanced with hoppiness, sweetness, and malts. It is no wonder the Arrogant Bastard is so touted as a great and more-than-worthy beer the adventurous as well as the beer-loving. If you don't like Arrogant Bastard then you're either: 1) An idiot. 2) An idiot who likes beer but doesn't understand it. 3) An idiot who understands beer but is not worthy. And even now I question whether or not I am worthy of its glory. But it's my birthday, damnit, and I am worthy.  Like I said, wait until the beer warms up a little before you drink it or it'll be all hops and no flavor. If you drink it cold then it will not be very drinkable. If you let it sit out then it will be much more enjoyable. It has a ton of flavor and is pretty sweet but is also very drinkable when drank at the proper temperature. This would be a great beer to have with a bacon cheeseburger...with some bleu cheese. At least, that's what I'm thinking about now.  The next time you're out and feel like being an arrogant bastard, go out and buy an Arrogant Bastard to see how it feels...and tastes. You deserve it and so does the beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,DrinkinBoy,3.39,"Stone Arrogant Bastard pours a very clear dark amber color. The head is light tan and has great retention.  Its aroma has notes of caramel, roasted nut, and toffee.  The taste starts off sweet, but the mid palate is quickly passed by into a overwhelming hop bitterness. There are no distinct flavors just a tongue thrashing of bitterness. This taste lingers on the palate for minutes.  The mouthfeel is heavy and the carbonation is nice and subtle which helps balacne out the tanins from the hops.  Like any extrememly hopped West Coast beer I can't imagine drinking more than one without tongue fatigue more like exhaustion.

A bombardment of rich malt and bitter hops blended with an eclectic dash of pine, fresh cut timothy, and ripe banana.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and delightfullly smooth.

147,92,SWMeyer4141,3.44,"Reading that bottle 4 years ago was an experience, I had to try it. Since then I pick up an Arogant Bastard every now and then. Saw a bomber for 3.99 earlier so figured I would pick it up and drink half before and half during dinner.  Appearance-Dark dark red color. Light brown colored, creamy head that leaves a lot of lacing. No matter how the smell or taste is, this beer is one of the best looking beers I've seen.  Smell-I can smell a sweet, burnt caramel with some hops lingering in the backround. I don't get too much citrus which i thought It had but get some darkfruits, I actually can get some barleywine characteristics. I little spicier though, some clove sneaking through.  Taste-Malty, bready/yeasty. You get some sweetness at the forefront and the hops come through at the end. I get some raisons as well. It's not bad, but just not as complex as i remembered it last.  Mouthfeel-Medium-Full bodied which goes down very smooth. Back of the throat gets the hops and a dryness which makes you going back.  Overall-Four years ago I would have said this is the craziest, most intense beer ever, but now it's kind of average to me. The look is amazing, but the smell/taste are getting weaker to my palate. Stone does a great job at promoting their craft beers by their intense marketing campaign, but it's almost getting a little bit old to me. I would prefer some other offerings such as the Sublimely Self-Rightous ale and Ruination.

Sheets and rings of lacing line the glass. A gorgeous beer with a disappointing head.  The first thing I notice in the nose is the sweet caramel malt amidst an enveloping aroma of citrus hops. The sweetness is the star of the show and the caramel really comes through predominantly. There's also a bready quality which actually reminds me of Stone's Pale Ale.  The thing I always come back to with Arrogant Bastard is the way it tastes. It might not be the most impressive looking beer or the most aromatic, but boy does it taste good! This beer is amped up to 11 in both malt and hops. I know it was ""extreme"" for its day, back when it was first brewed, but it's still a classic American strong ale. Plenty of citrus hops, loads of bitterness, sweet caramel and bready malts, the faintest hint of alcohol; a classic.  Moderate to heavy in the mouth which is pretty appropriate for the style and the taste. A bit higher carbonation would probably make it perfect though.

Great and complex range of flavors. Caramel, dense toast, toffee, oats, tea, and some milk chocolate.  This beer drinks bigger than it actually is. It's a great presentation of a unique beer.

Malts definitely take a back seat but do come through on the palette with a sweet honey and buttered caramel flavour.

Body color was a nice chocolate brown that was cloudy with particulates and had a moderate amount of carbonation.  AROMA: Aroma was a very nice moderate barley with a light floral and pine hops smell.  TASTE: The taste surprised me. The barley taste was quite light and the floral, grass and pine hops flavors were heavily prominent -- much more so than I would have suspected. Nonetheless, the brew was quite tasty.  MOUTHFEEL: This beer was medium bodied with a slick texture and moderate carbonation, a combination that was pleasing to the tongue. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and finished heavily bitter with a long finish. Body lacing was fair and dissipated slowly.  DRINKABILITY: This strong ale lived up to its name. It was certainly memorable, grabbing hold of the taste buds and not letting go. This isn't the kind of beer you select for a night of continuous drinking.

147,92,YouSkeete,4.3,"A: Dark red and mahogany, just in between cloudy and clear. Weak off-white head, fades into moderate lacing.  S: Dry bitter hops, caramel sweetness, bready and dry-hopped malts, rye and pumpernickel, earthy pine, and some hints of dark fruits and citrus zest.  T: Extremely fresh hop bite, right in the beginning. Caramel, smooth and dry malts, and dark fruits are the main components of the flavor. Towards the end of the drink the rye and pine notes show themselves. Described commonly as an aggressive flavor, i can agree with it, though it's just more complex than necessarily 'aggressive'. A well balanced strong ale with a bit more emphasis on the hops.  M: Smooth, dry and somewhat sticky. Full bodied with medium carbonation. Tame aftertaste consisting of caramel and dry-hopped malts.  D: Spectacular. The name is fitting, i believe.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Tundruth,4.33,"Pours a reddish brown color topped with a fluffy, light tan head. Looks impeccable The nose is varied and delicious, smells of citrus, pine, malts and a faint hops. Taste is strong and hard to describe, the hops bitterness is most evident although a pine/fruitiness shows through too. This beer is vibrant and complex, the mouth feel is dry and just like the smell and flavor, aggressive. This brew is definitely something worth seeking out and trying, it is strong and complex making it exciting to drink, a beer that no two drinkers will describe as exactly the same.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Smells of citrus, pine, grapefruit, malty, toffee notes and a faint sweetness are present. Taste is nice and hoppy, citrus and pine notes come out in the flavour, great balance with the malt, dry hop finish with grapefruit rounding it out. Nice full mouthfeel, hop oil slickness and a medium amount of carbonation.

147,92,mjtiernan,3.7,"Aroma included pine and a touch of grape. Taste was unique...intense with malt and hops that went on FOREVER. Insanely complex. Finishes a little bitter and dry but nothing to detract from my enjoyment. A big, big beer but not too, too strong at 7.2% ABV. Stone is really good at incorporating big beer flavor without knocking you on your ass with inflated ABV numbers.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,SHODriver,4.35,"A: pours a deep brown with a fluffy light tan head. It looks a bit evil. S: Smell is a bit herbaceous with a bit of caramel from the malt. A touch piney as well. T: Deliciously bitter at first taste giving way to a slight caramel sweetness that is battered back by a wave of pineyness. The sweetness and bitterness battle for dominance on the taste buds with it melding to a bittersweet flavor. A bit of pine in the aftertaste with a touch of toffee like sweetness. Very well done. M: Slightly prickly carbonation and a slightly silky smooth mouthfeel accompany it. Definitely not watery, but not heavy either. D: It's gonna be fun drinking this bomber, but that's about the limit. This bad boy wasn't made for sessioning.  Overall: A very outside the box product from the folks at stone.

147,92,SteelerNation,4.33,"Lets see if this lives up to the name.  This brew eminates a strong aroma of hops that I can smell a few feet away from the glass. Has a sticky sweet malty smell. Lacing and head are both pretty sick and beat everything but nitrogen carbonation. The beer pours a dark bronze color. There is still foam left 15 minutes after the pour.  Citrus American hops dominate the palate for most of the taste. The hops taste of pine and grapefruit. Roasted malt makes up the malt backbone with a dark chocolate-like aftertaste. Tastes very much like an ESB, only with more punch.  The mouthfeel is thick and heavy, which is a big plus for me. I can hardly feel the alcohol content, even after drinking 22oz. The aftertaste isn't overly dry either.  This beer packs a punch and puts light beers in their place.

T/M: Aggressive hop bitterness. Grapefruit-like citric and resiny/pine notes in the middle fading to just bitter in the finish. Malt profile is pretty typical red/brown ale and definitely not the focus. It supports the complex hop bitterness. There is a slight sweetness up front, with toasty notes in the middle, but it doesn't come anywhere near balancing out that bitterness.

Color: medium brown w/ red highlights  Very small off-white head that persists.  aroma: light malt, american hops with light grapefruit that blends together magnificently.  Mouthfeel: It has the carbonation level of a lite american lager. Slightly creamy.  taste: Hop bitterness that lingers for several seconds after every sip. Hint of ethanol, but it is not overpowering. Good balance between malt and hops. Strong biscuit flavor.  This beer is best to be enjoyed at a steady sipping pace.

147,92,jayhawk73,4.33,"Pours a medium dark caramel color with a perfect two finger head. The smell is fruity hoppiness, with a little malt thrown in. Knowing Stone's reputation for big beer tastes, I'm surprised the smell isn't a little stronger. Maybe it will get stronger when it warms a little. Ah- but the taste delivers! This beer slaps you in the face and says 'Pay attention!' Great taste, with lots of hops mixed w/ citrus and some malt thrown in as well. Mouthfeel is nice, and it has a slightly bitter aftertaste- which lingers. The drinkability is good, but this beer makes me want to sip it.. enjoy it.. It feels like an 10-11% beer, but it's only 7.2%. Another great beer from Stone. Everything I've had of theirs has been great, and this is no exception.

Unfortunately I moved into a state that for some reason didn't seem to offer Stone, and as a result have not been into their offerings. I love their beer, so a little over three years ago I decided to buy some to cellar.  Bought in Livonia, MI moved to Minnesota and brought into Jersey. I expect it to be decent. But you never know.  Smells good opened with that nice sound. Looks like it's still beer, a nice silky smooth foam and some soap like bubbles in the bottle. Glass looks very hazy. Smells fruity, malt with over ripe banana.  Foams in the mouth with an unholy bitterness. Carbonized goodness, that has no equal in recent memory. Warming, and dry with some heavy hints of spice.  No telling how much older these can get.  The only problem is that I can't say I'd drink alot of these. I would love to have a case of these.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Pretty aromatic.  T: Upper moderate bitterness with lots of resin and grapefruit. Caramel malt makes an effort to balance, but that tilts toward the aggressive hops. Alcohol is noticeable in the flavor.  M: Upper medium body with upper moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is sticky and dry with some astringency.  Overall: An aggressive American Strong Ale.

147,92,JerzDevl2000,4.1,"Finally got around to having this, which surprised me since I've been reviewing beers for years now and this is one of the most popular brews on this website. Although it's not as flavorful and memorable as the other beers from Stone that I've had, this was a good beer and certainly worthy of the name that it carries!  Nice vibrant brown hue to this as I poured it out. The head was good and frothy and there was a bit of lacing on this as well. The taste had a nice, solid hop presence to it with notes of citrus mixed in with a dry-hopped aftertaste. Like the Green Flash beers, this had a ""stink"" to it that was reminiscent of weed. This never felt strong or overpowering but certainly had the hallmarks of a good West Coast beer in the way it looked, tasted, and smelled.  No resin to be found like Sierra Nevada but the greatness of this beer lies in the taste. It's relatively strong in the alcohol department but when I drank this, I would have never have guessed that. I split this with a friend but it would have been pretty easy to finish on my own and even though there are better offerings by this brewer and in this style of beer, one couldn't do wrong with this. I could easily see it being the standby for quite a few people that enjoy craft beer!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,DavoleBomb,3.66,"Poured into a snifter. The oaked version of this was my first true love. Back then, a beer like this was as rich and flavorful as they come. Seems like those days are over though. The last Oaked AB I had didn't have the effect it did those years ago given the amount of good beer I've put down and the growth of my palate since.  4.5 A: Clear deep amber/mahogany color. Nearly three fingers of beige creamy/frothy hybrid head. Average to good retention and plentiful nonuniform lacing.  3.5 S: Caramel, brown sugar, and even a touch of nuttiness. Hops add pine, orangy citrus, and a touch of flowers.  3.5 T: The taste is still aggressive enough to warrant a name like Arrogant Bastard. The first thing I noticed was a decent hop bitterness punch. Orange, grapefruit, and piney hop flavor. Good amount of caramel and toffee malt flavor with a general biscuity maltiness.  3.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Smooth, but could be creamier.  4.0 D: I was glad I had a bomber. AB is a solid beer and a good introduction into the world of higher ABV, more flavorful beers.

A perfect blend of strong malty goodness with a powerful blast of smoky flavor. This flavor really can boast the arrogance of it's name.  The mouth feel of this one was pretty heavy as this guy tends to be on the darker side of beer.

Very interesting  T: Hoppy bite when the juice first enters the mouth. The malts come a little later. Dry on the finish with a little alcohol burn. I was a little confused on the first sips, but the more I drank it, the more I loved it.  M: Good mouthfeel. I would say medium bodied and the perfect amount of carbonation  D: Pretty good drinkability for the alcohol content. In fact, thats the only thing keeping it from being almost session-like.

There's a slight hint of citrus and I couldn't tell if it would taste bitter or not.  There's a delicious roasted malt flavor with the bitterness coming late on the back of the tongue.

I went to my local beer importer who was selling it by the bottle for £12 British Pound Sterling!  The Arrogance!  Anywhoo, i nabbed a bottle along with some of my preplanned Belgian buys and got on the London Underground home. I chilled it for an hour in the fridge so it was a little below room temperature but not freezing cold as i wanted to taste what it had on offer.  When i poured it looked like my type of drink, but it all went downhill from there. The bitterness put me off straight away and i found it to be nothing like any type of 'Ale' ive had. It was more like an English bitter but with more carbonation, and i am not a fan of bitters. I actually didnt even want to finish it.  Glad i tried it.

Sweet and malty up front with some dark/dried fruit coming through in the middle. Not really sure what its from but these flavors are hard to place. Bitterness follows without much hop flavor unless the hops are contributing to that dried fruit flavor. The aftertaste is straight up grapefruit so that might be my answer. Alcohol is actually not very noticeable even as the beer warms its very drinkable.  M - medium bodied.. medium carbonation... good stuff.

147,92,Groomsy,4.42,"22. oz bottle, ""enjoy by"" date of Feb. 22 2011, so I'm cutting it close on this one. Poured into a snifter and shared with a friend. Pretty pumped about this beer.  Appearance: Pours a rich, dark mahogany/burnt amber with a thick, rocky tan head of a finger or two, slowly dissipating to a film on top and never really fades away but leaves a collar of bubbles. Lets you know what it's about right off the bat. Sheets of lacing drag the glass during consumption. Almost barleywine-like in its appearance.  Smell: Huge, but balanced. Simultaneously occurring notes of pine, floral hops, caramel, and roasted malts bombard the nose all at once, but it's not confusing or overbearing. Slight hint of alcohol. A kick in the nose, gives me things to anticipate.  Taste: Where has this been all my life?! Unforgiving notes of pine and pungent floral hops start out, followed by a rich, sugary sweetness and caramel/roasted malts. More bitterness and slightly herbal, woody, and citric tastes from the hops in the finish, but balanced by a robust sweetness. Hints of alcohol prickle the tongue throughout the drinking session. This is not for the faint of heart, not at all. Big flavor, and it is bold on all fronts.  Mouthfeel: Slight warming alcohol, but the overall mouthfeel is remarkably rich, thick, and creamy. Hop notes and caramel flavors linger on the finish. Well-placed carbonation which helps to enhance all the flavors involved in the beer. Fairly dry in the finish, but enhanced flavors as the beer warms makes me want another sip.  Drinkability: Take it slow with this one. Not because of the alcohol content, but because the flavors will grow more as the beer warms, and you'll grow to appreciate the flavors more. Nice for sitting back and sipping.  Hands down one of the best beers I've had. I almost was not worthy of its arrogance, but I loved it too much to not finish it. This is a beast of a beer.

Not an overwelming smell, but not bad either, light hops and malty goodness.  Taste was very good. Slightly bitter, malts and slight hops, and overall good beer.

S: balance of malts and hops, some sort of sweetness, maybe a hint of cinnamon, pine and citrus notes, and a fruity scent  T: dry, bitter, and smokey, pine hints and a noted floral taste at the backend  M: mild carbonation, smooth, medium body  D: nice balance of bitterness and malts makes for an easy to drink brew.

147,92,shandy,4.6,"There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said before and I rarely, if ever, post a review.  Last night however we flooded in our street after storms that haven't been seen in this area within living memory. Our house escaped thankfully but I spent the day clearing out the one room that flooded and the garden which was shot to shit and, of course, helping the neighbours with whatever needed doing.  I've been abstaining from beer for Feb Fast which, given that we're only on the 5th, means I haven't gone too long although today also marks my 1 week without beer anniversary.  Anyway, after a truly awful 24 hours I decided a beer was in order and where did I turn? Arrogant Bastard. It's been over a year since i tried this beer and tonight there could have been no better beer I could have selected. It was all in one package. The malt, the hops the mouthfeel. Everything hit the spot and funnily what I'd actually been craving over the past few days was a real citrus driven IPA. This wasn't it but it was the better for it. I made the right choice putting those other beers back. The gargoyle spoke to me.  The rain has been off today so I'm going to have another beer.

147,92,Mora2000,4,"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the piney hops and the caramel malt. The flavor is very hoppy and high in alcohol. I get a lot of pine and orange, as well as some caramel malt. Still, this beer is all about the hops and the bitterness is about medium. Fairly boozy overall.

147,92,perryw,4.18,"Poured from a bomber in to a pint glass. Pours a dark cloudy amber color with an off white thick head. The head seems to stick around as I drink, remaining about a pinky fingertip's width high down the glass.  I pick up some citrus and sweetness and pine in the smell.  There's some bitterness to the taste, and I can taste the high-ish ABV. A bit of a smokeyness in there. Maybe even a bit of bit chocolate at the end?  Feels bubbly in my mouth. Rather creamy.  Very drinkable. Goes down easily. Happy to sip on this one and will be happy to buy it again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BaronRogue,4.2,"Poured from the bomber into my chalice, produced a finger or two of tan head that bubbled away slowly, leaving average lace.  Smells of fruit and pine, gets better each time i take a whiff.  Tastes strong, as the style dictates. For me the bitterness hits first, and then recedes, revealing an almost coffee taste of the toasted malts. (the bitterness probably aids in the coffee imagining)  Mouthfeel is good, not great, almost feels dual-layered in carbonation and syrup.  Very drinkable, for me it got better with every sip (and not thats not because of the high alcohol :P ) Worth sitting back and enjoying on its own, not really one you want to pound or have too many of.

S: Pine and floral hops with a hint of citrus (mainly lemon), pale malts slightly toasted, a little caramel.  T: Pine and floral hops hit the pallet first with a good helping of bitterness. There's a bit of citrus in there too. This is balanced with a fairly strong pale malt character that has a good bit of caramel sweetness. Fairly bitter and dry finish.  M: Carbonation is fairly high and crisp, body is solid but not very viscous. Fairly stick and just a little chewy.

Taste/Mouthfeel: Exceptionally active carbonation that makes this quite an enjoyable beer. Mostly pine hops in the flavor and alcohol comes through as it warms. Definitely some dark fruit and even apple as well. Smokey wood as well. Something bitter in the end as well. All in all very good but it doesn't all add up.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, sweet hops, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, dark chocolate, sweet hops, and slight citrus. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was brew was great. Had a very excellent flavor and good aroma going on here.

S: A bit spicy at first, and then some juicy citrus and tropical fruits come out. I didn't find it overwhelming and in your face, the aroma was more subdued. A bit of alcoholic burn comes out as it warms.  T: Solid biscuit/caramel malt presence to go with lots of pine and mouth coating resinous bitterness. A decent bite to it, mostly from the hoppy bitterness but it seems at least slightly due to the ABV. There's a very light herbal, almost floral undertone throughout that adds nice complexity.  M: Medium-body, slick and creamy, with a nice dry finish with lingering bitterness.  D: Lots of bitterness but not unbalanced, there's lots of malt to back it up.

Beautiful dark ruby red with a great head, perfect carb. Stone really knows how to make a beer smell good.. jeez.. must be dry hopping. This beer was very hoppy but it also had a mellow minty herbal note in there as well to calm it down.

147,92,climax,4.55,"Paired with cracked pepper Triscuits and sharp pepper jack cheese after the initial review... excellent. Poured into a SV balloon glass.  It pours a brilliant mahogany with ruby highlights. The tan head is large and fades, fades, er.... very slow. The lacing is excellent, ornate circles and notches form as I proceed.  The nose blends everything good. Right away, lots of herbal hop flavors of mint, green pepper, and floral tones prove the IBU count is not lacking. The sweeter malt brings to balance immediately after that, sporting caramel, toffee, ripe banana, and a bit of brandy. The alcohol is evident and adds just the slightest edge on an excellent nose.  The flavor boasts the same fantastic balancing act. Herbal hoppy tones begin the journey and stay long through the lengthy finish. The malt bull adds just enough sweetness and toasty backbone to keep excellent harmony. Once again the alcohol provides just enough feedback to keep me wary of this beer's ass kicking ability.  The mouthfeel may just be the best part. Its utterly creamy right from the point it hits the lips. The crisp carbonation makes it's presence known soon thereafter, but settles down in no time. The feel is slightly slick until the finish, where the hoppy dryness puts a gun to my head and forces me to have another sip.  That being said, it excels in every category. I would expect nothing less from Stone, and it doesn't need another review to further cement it's reputation, but this really is a quality brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

As the hop flavor recedes, you get a good mouthful of toasted malt before the hops hit you again for a bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, with some alcohol joining the carbonation as it hits your tongue.  Drinkability: Good for a strong ale.

147,92,weizenbob,4.53,"22 ounce bomber (Enjoy by 12/16/10) partially poured into an oversized wine glass. An aggressive pour yields about one and a half fingers of tan head. Retention is excellent. Thick lacing beautifully lines the glass. The brew is amber hued and somewhat hazy. Close examination reveals a small amount of active carbonation in the glass.  I'm sampling this beer over a month past the enjoy by date, but the aroma is still giving off a pleasant bouquet of floral hops. Sweet apricot aromas compliment the floral arrangement. Mild licorice fragrances are also noted.  Beyond the freshness date, the flavor profile is still loaded with bitter hops. I don't know where the IBUs clock in for this beer, but the perceived bitterness is off the chart. Grapefruit rind immediately comes to mind. The malt base is earthy, not only providing no balance to the bitterness, but actually complimenting it. The label proudly (arrogantly?) boasts that ""This is an aggressive beer"" and they weren't kidding. There is a mild sweetness in the background but I can't tell if it's from the malt or the alcohol. All of the 7.2% ABV is noted on the tongue but it doesn't come off as boozy. It finishes with more bitterness as hop oils aggressively coat the mouth, tongue and throat.  Despite all of the flavor barbs, this Bastard is incredibly smooth. It is medium bodied with a light amount of carbonation. The alcohol aids in the somewhat velvety texture. It is amazingly drinkable, in spite of the alcohol content, and in spite of the extreme bitterness at hand. They call it Arrogant Bastard, but it's not really arrogance if you can back up your claims. This beer delivers the goods.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) I give two Schlitz about Arrogant Bastard.

Delectable dry finish that is a perfect combination of the bitter hops and sweet malt.  M - Medium bodied and high carbonation. Not too oily or creamy, goes down very smooth.

147,92,Fatheranderson,4.88,"Wow. I just drank a 1 liter of this with a big juicy Tbone steak, and all I can say is wow, what a perfect match.  Appearance: Thick, dark, reminds me of a very good Porter.  Smell: Bitter hops, slightly burnt smelling which was absolutely the only complaint I had about this brew.  Taste: Arrogant, powerful, aggressive. Mildly sweet, but very bitter. It reminds me of a very good strong black coffee with about 3 teaspoons of sugar... add some 90% cocoa dark chocolate and you've got a decent approximation of the flavor (though that really doesn't describe the whole flavor... you've really got to try it to catch all of what I mean).  Mouthfeel: thick, hearty, slightly sticky. Very smooth overall with just enough carbonation to enhance the flavor without damaging it.  Drinkability: Wow... this is a hard one. It's definitely not an accessible beer (people that aren't used to IPAs or generally good beers need to avoid this one like the clap). That said, this beer deserves to be a fixture in the beer cooler/cellar of all true IPA lovers. This also isn't something you can just shotgun in 30 seconds and be done with it. The complicated flavor really demands that you slow down and appreciate every sip while you savor every new aspect of it.  Overall: This beer is just too complicated for anyone that isn't used to good beer. If you want a simple, easily drinkable beer, this isn't the brew for you, but if you want something to savor that will really make you pause and consider it's characteristics, this is definitely something to look into.

The first quarter of the bomber was spent just trying to orient myself to the extremely bold yet complex flavor of the beer. Once my mouth and brain adjusted I enjoyed the majority of the beer finding it to be bold obviously, but also decently balanced, only slightly too bitter for my taste as times. The final quarter of the bomber was a challenge however. I found the alcohol to really take over and the bitterness to be too much to handle. I did finish the beer, but considered dumping the bottom of the glass more than once.  Service: Pint. Drank to halfway then refilled with the remainder of the bomber. 50 degrees.  Appearance: dark amber, translucent but not cloudy. Very thick head, three-four fingers that stayed for half the beer.  Smell: Excellent, very hoppy but surprisingly inviting.  Taste: Described above. Generally balanced but very aggressive.  Mouthfeel: Unremarkable, I left neither impressed or unimpressed.  Drinkablity: Described above.

Not so dark that it turns away the uninitiated, but not so pale that you wonder if it will have any flavor. Good head and retention. Had to elaborate here, as it is about the first 5 in any category I have ascribed.  Smells of hops. Need I say more?  Tastes quite dry up front, and end with a sweet note. Toes the line for bitterness. Well balanced, but a nonbeergeek could be turned off. That is a good thing.  Bitter and lightly bubble mouthfeel.  Drinkable.

Aroma of malty goodness. Caramel with a slight roasty aroma. Slight hop aroma in the nose.  Taste is great. I don't know why I don't buy this more often. Just as it smells. Great malty flavor with a nice crisp bitterness from the hops and little bit of roasted grains they throw in.  Mouthfeel is smooth and malty. Nice carb.

147,92,mhpalmer,2.44,"Poured into a tulip, a hazy almost-opaque reddish brown. Thick tan head made of mostly tiny bubbles with a few large ones interspersed. The head lasted pretty long, and leaves a ring around the edge and a little foamy glob in the middle that I like to save for the last sip like shooting an oyster. The sticky head leaves some nice lacing on the glass that leaves rings as I drink it down.  Smells like caramel and grass with just a touch of grapefruit, and pretty solidly that. There's not a lot going on in the aroma, which is nice. I learned the KISS principle in high school, and that was probably the best thing I learned there.  Taste is malty and bready up front with a nice floral hop finish. The middle of the taste is sort of musky-fruity. There is a strong and long-lasting alcoholic and bitter after-taste. The more of it I drink, the more I taste the grapefruit character from the hops.  Mouthfeel is a bit thick. Could use a bit more carbonation to lighten it up. Also, the alcoholic/bitter aftertaste is very off-putting and lasts an inordinate amount of time.  Drinkability: Okay, I get it...you're a big beer. And you don't really care what I think about you, you arrogant bastard. If you did, you might make yourself a bit more drinkable. This beer is harsh in my opinion. That isn't to say I don't like it, I can be a bit masochistic from time to time. I just wouldn't ever drink two of these in a row (in fact, I only finished THIS bottle because I can't bear to waste beer), but I suppose that isn't the point of a beer like this. Then again, what IS the point of a beer like this?  Eerie side note: On my second pour, the foamy glob that I noted before actually became three separate globs that looked just like a smiley face.

I'm very surprised by this bottle. I remember it being a little more harsh the previous two or three times I'd had it. It's a very good beer but I couldn't drink more than this bottle.

147,92,thebrood1987,5,"Stone always knows how to properly hop their beers in the manner they describe it... I'm never disappointed, when they say its going to be bitter or very hoppy it always is. As soon as you smell it you get that trademark Stone brewery pine smell with citrus and the sweet malt in the background. I love how Stone is one of the only breweries that gets that pine hop resin taste and mixes it real well with citrus hops. The malt really comes into play in this beer and almost reminds me of what some breweries would call a black ipa. It kind of reminds me of a hoppier Victory Yakima Glory but better. The roasted malt blends in so nicely with the resinous hop bite it gives. That's the word that sets Stone IPA or highly hopped beers aside from other breweries highly hopped IPA's...resinous. Nobody can ever complain they don't get an amazing hop flavor and bite unless its past due its expiration date. This might be even hoppier than their regular IPA they brew mostly because of the different hops they use and the roasted malt coming together for a more bitter bite. Amazing beer that regular beer drinkers might have a hard time drinking because of the intense amount of flavor this has. Beer never tasted so rich, potent and good. I don't think this brewery can make a bad beer. My favorite California brewery.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Nice, resiny hops cut the malty sweetness to make it more drinkable. Nice roasted, almost nutty flavors play on the palate before a wave of hop bitterness cuts through all that to the point that you think your palate might be ruined for the next sip.

147,92,brewerburgundy,3.88,"20oz pour in a large shaped pint-like glass at the Standard Pour, Standard (Sonora), CA.  This bastage is deep candy apple red, a little redwood and coppery. Its head is nice, it's a very nice pour by the nice young lady tending bar.  The nose isn't super harsh; hits of bitter citric hop, grapefruit rind, orange oil, and bitter alcohol. Yeah, it is a bit coarse.  The flavors are equally rough, with caramel dropped on top of bitter alcohol. Orange oil is bitterly fruity. Simple but tasty.  The mouthfeel is a little bit of a bastard, but the beer goes down smooth. It's expectedly rough with bitterness and alcohol but that's just part of it's character.  I still find the drinkability a bit dangerous, possibly more dangerous, on-tap. I do like this beer but it really isn't a favorite of mine. If I give the bottle another go I'll re-review because I think my score is a little high.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,billiumk,4.53,"Dark amber color, slightly hazy. About one finger off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. Vaguely peppery smell with some fruitiness underneath. Good mouthfeel with fairly minimal carbonation. The hops really come out in the initial tasting but finishes out smoothly. Stone Brewery products just became available in my area in the last year and this is the third example I've tried and is as good as the other two. Looking forward to more of the work.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,nkersten,3.8,"Bomber poured into imperial pint. Hazy dried blood red with a small off white cap with great retention and lacing. Smells of burnt sugar, candied fruit, resinous hops. Taste is bitter at first, mellowing out a bit to let the caramel and brown sugar maltiness through. Finishes bitter. Medium body and carbonation. A good readily available brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BeerBuckeye,4.23,"A- Pours deep red/amber, almost purple, with a dark creamy head.  S - Hits you right away, hops and fruit. Some grapefruit, other citrus scents. A bit of 'earthy' smell as well, somewhat a mixture of flower and pine.  T - Very first sensation I get is pine needles. Starts a bit sweet with those fruity notes from the smell, before resolving into piney bitterness. Great amount of hops in this beer, almost peppery.  M - It neither coats nor dries the mouth. The pep of the hops settles near the back of the mouth. Mouth is left a little moistened for the next drink. Just nice and smooth the entire way  D - Remarkably drinkable. It hits you in the face, but it goes down really well. Can barely taste the alcohol in this beer.  Overall - Just a delicious, delicious beer. I love the balance in this beer, the bountiful amount of flavors and how the beer moves from sweet to bitter so seemlessly. Just outstanding",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,yeahnatenelson,4.1,"Appearance -- Pours a burgundian ruby hue with two fingers of stiff khaki head. Thin drape of sticky lace. It's a bitter beast for certain.  Smell -- Juicy citrus, pine resin, musty vegetation (cannabis?), Caramelized fruits, . Slight solvent-like burn on the nose, but otherwise the alcohol is undetected.  Taste -- The hopping is dank and fruity: grapefruit rind, pine resin, leafy and musky hops. Bitterness is significant. Malting is on the sweet side with toasted malt, and caramel, bitter chocolate, and bread pudding. Mild mineral character is also present; this seems to be a Stone calling card. Additional dry amber/red malt flavor toward the finish. Lingering flavors of candied orange peel and pine resin.  Mouthfeel --Medium-bodied, a bit viscous, with well-balanced carbonation: feels somewhat gentle but still quite energetic. Lovely!  Drinkability -- This beer is a must-try, without question: wall of citrusy hop bitterness tempered by a well-malted base that brings to mind red ale-meets-barleywine.  Beyond being a great beer, this is an important beer in terms of the history of American craft brewing: its roots are in classic English brewing, but it doesn't conform to any pre-established style. Its imitators are legion, its equals few. While its spin-off beers may outshine it, there is no denying AB's mark on the craft beer landscape.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,OuthouseBrewing,4.65,I never drink it out of the bottle. I have to pour into a glass to see the gorgeous amber color. The smell is unmistakable and I take a whiff before every drink. The taste is everything the bottle says and pairs with many Pub foods. Drinkability makes my first choice if I grab a beer from Stone.

147,92,FosterJM,4.2,151st review on BA On draft to pint  App- A nice dark amber/light brown with a 1 finger head that was a little darker than white.  Smell- Its a big scent to take it. Hits me each time I have drank this. Its very hoppy with citrus and some floral. Matly spiciness as well.  Taste- It's been a long time since I had one of these and it's a lot better than I remember. Its strong and it's meant to be as the flagship beer. Hoppy strong and a little spicy with some nice undertones.  Mouth-Medium bodied and medium carbed. Nice aftertaste.  Drink- It was very good especially paired with a green chili burger. Last beer of 2010. Thanks Stone for a great sendoff!,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

T= beautiful, complex hops, both floral and bitters. Nice sweet malts, citrus, a complex boldness that needs to be experienced.  T= immaculate, inspiring, a ""standard"" in this style. Delicious, plentiful flavors, complex bitterness and floral hops yet nice sweet and possibly roasted malts and very light carramel notes.  M= very clean and true despite higher ABV and hoppy presence. Slightly grassy remnants, very light honey hints, dry malts and a variety of hops florals and bitters. A standard.

Brown-red, near garnet like. 2 fingers of head of eggshell white head. lacing is very nice, leaving both lines and a nice trail after each sip. Excellent.  Nose is a filling of piney, peppery hops. Malt backing is there, more bready and grainy than anything. This is one you tread lightly on.  Malt base comes to play early, giving a bit of saltine like breadiness and good caramel cream nature. Mild sweetness, but it is quickly overtaken by the hops. A piney mixture with a good pepper like spiciness that resonates well past the first sip.  So dang quaffable. Moderate creaminess, silky smooth, very nice and enjoyable mouthfeel. If it was more drink. This is one is dangerous, because the abv is in that realm of too much and not enough. It is well hidden and can quickly become a problem. Watch out, this one comes to play, and has a nasty bite.  Buy two, because after the first, you will be wanting another.

147,92,mavbrew,4.3,"Poured from 22 oz. bomber into Portsmouth Brewery snifter.  A: Pours a deep copper color with amber highlights and a nice thick, light tan head that slowly dissipates leaving some nice lacing down the glass.  S: Has a nice hoppy nose to it with some citrus scents and some caramel malts.  T: Up front taste is pretty hoppy and has nice citrus notes to it with a sweetness from the caramel malt. The finish is bitter and smooth all at once. Hops leave a bitterness in the palate well after the beer has passed.  M: Medium bodied with average carbonation.  D: This offering has a nice hoppy presence, highly flavorful and enjoyable beer. The alcohol is hid well by the hops and is highly drinkable. I can't believe it's taken me so long to try it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Enigmaticgesture,4.4,"Experienced both on-tap and bottled. The difference between the two is staggering beyond what is normally expected.  Bottled: I would be tempted to rate the beer almost half a point lower in almost ever category, especially taste. The hazy bite of this potent beer seems to be somewhat lessened, but the bottled version retains the same strong malty smell and spiciness.  On-Tap: Wow. A solid and awesome beer that lives up to its name! The flavor is much stronger on the front end when consumed on-tap, the spices and malt practically kicking in the face of any bastard lucky enough to drink a sip. The hops wash away the spice toward the end, leaving just a trace of malt and hops on the tongue. Extremely drinkable!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Northjames,4.18,"22 oz bottle.  Great looking beer. Very clear, ruby/garnet color. A thick, rocky head that sticks to the sides of my mug, forming huge penisulas of solid foam.  I get a huge hit of grapefruit for aroma. A slight bready-ness.  Taste is a sharp sweetness, quickly mixing with citrus/grapefruit. The alcohol is present and pleasant. I get a little bit of a dark chocolate kind of taste (that I also find in Duvel). Aftertaste is very nice, biscuits or bread.  Drinkablity is high for a beer of this substantial character.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,GarthDanielson,4.15,"Poured on-tap at the Stone Brewery. The beer is a beautiful red-copper color, with a thin ring of head. It has a malty smell with hops undertones. The flavor is initally a spicy-malt blast, followed by light bitter hops. The flavors are very strong and full, and very well balanced. There is a spicy, bitter aftertaste to the beer, with a hoppy finish. Great beer with heavy, non-apologetic flavors. Kudos!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,nataku00,4.03,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint glass. Beer is a vibrant red / brown, clear to show some carbonation in the beer. Initial two fingers of tan colored fluffy head that left some nice lacing on the glass.  Nose is citrus hops, grapefruit, orange peel, and rye like malt that lends a bit of caramel.  Citrus is the first thing you taste, grapefruit and orange, the bitterness coming shortly thereafter balanced by the sweet caramel malt through the finish. Slight lingering bitter aftertaste but it's not overpowering. Not much of an alcohol bite, which is nice.  Medium bodied with light carbonation to keep the tongue clean. Fairly easy to drink but the hops are bold enough to keep your pace slower.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

T - Bitter coffee and roasted malt with a good amount of floral hops. Bitterness balanced nicely between hoppy and roasty. Long finish starts sweet and then through coffee and finally the lingering herbal hops.  M - Medium body, med-low carbonation and slight chalkiness. No burn from high alcohol level.

147,92,BeerMeInMS,4.41,"Drinking Date: 12/23/10 Drink-by Date: 11/21/10 * a little past its date but I belive the high alcohol (7.2%) kept it fine. I tasted no complications.  Glassware: large curved pilsner-style glass Bottle: 22 oz. brown bottle with the coolest advertising I have ever seen or read. The paragraph on the back was the reason I bought the beer.  Appearance: Visual perfection. retddish-brown color that is both deep and bright. Thick, frothy, tan-colored head that sticks with you until the end. Best retained head I have seen in a beer so far. It left spidery lacing all the way down the glass.  Smell: Typical smell of a quality beer with lots of hops... floral and piney...very fresh and refreshing.  Taste: Lots going on in this beer! The beer kept surprising me with its complexity the whole time I drank. A little taste of bitterness is evident first, which is quickly followed by a strong and faintly sweet, toasted flavor. The bitter, hoppy taste and the malt flavor then blend for a complex, but balanced taste. The beer left me with a bitter, earhty taste of hops, which I enjoyed. But like I said... as I drank I kept discovering more nuances. There always seemed to be an underlying hoppy, bitterness in every taste. The best thing was that I didn't have a few sips and my taste buds grow accustomed and dull out. Rather, every sip was a pleasurable, interesting experience. (Would give it a 4.8 if I could)  Mouthfeel: The big flavor makes it feel like a big beer, but the beer has medium body and smooth texture along with a good amount of bubbly carbonation.  Drinkablity: The 22 oz. I drank were enough. I might drink a couple pints, but no more. The big flavor and strong hop taste make this beer one to slowly be enjoyed singly or as the penultimate beer of the evening. However, I don't reckon that against the beer. The fact that every sip of the beer was delicious and interesting is reason enough for high marks.  Notes: Love this beer. If you like beer with big, complex flavor and a good dose of hoppy bitterness then I would say you are 'worthy' to have this beer (even though the bottle says otherwise). Will purchase this one again when I can find it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,TheBrewo,4.09,"This brew pours a dark tawny color. It has a one finger tan head that sticks around for a bit, before sinking down into large aggregates of bubbles covering the top of the liquid. The beer is opaque, with little carbonation visualized. Decent lacing appears as the beer disappears. The aroma is comparable to a basic doppelbock. It has deep dark malts, with a bit of a toast, sweet caramel, buttery diacetyls, clean hops, and what seems to be a bit of yeast on the very back. As we sip, we start with bready roasted malts, and a tinge of metal. This falls to a hop-dominant middle. The hops used taste floral, and a bit piney. Here we also get sweetness, not unlike butterscotch and toffee. The finish is with the same hops, and is slightly salty. The aftertaste breathes similarly, with hops as the shining flavor, but without that overt hop bitterness. The body is medium and the carbonation is light to medium. The feel is a bit chewy, and the beer both coats (lightly) and cools the mouth. The mouth is left satiated. The abv is on the higher end, but standard, and the beer drinks nicely.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its rich aroma. It smelled very similar to a doppelbock, which plays right to our favorites. It was buttery and roasty and sweetly malty. Additionally, the spiel on the back of the bottle, about being too good for everybody, is awesome. We also liked the fact, as advertised by the bottle, that it is a simple brew, utilizing the most basic and freshest ingredients. This, too, was evident upon tasting, making for an easy going, natural-tasting brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,DrinkingDrake,4.22,Had out of a bomber. I think that is the only way it is bottled  A deep Red/Brown color with a good 2 finger not quite white head.  The smell is dominated by some great hops. Earthy/Citrus/Pine balanced perfectly with some caramel and grainy malts  A pine grapefruit gets you in the beginning but as it finishes the caramel toasty malts shine through but just enough to make the citrus hop flavor really stand out for the aftertaste. For how heavy (ABV) it is I want to keep sipping.  Beautiful color/aroma/flavor and finish.  Someone bought this as a gift for me about 5 years ago.

147,92,biegaman,4.2,"Arrogant Bastard is of a beautifully polished cherry-wood colour that would look every bit as classy and handsome as a bar top as it does just sitting on one. Its leaking highlights broadcast the fact that this deep, darkish beer is actually spotlessly transparent and chalk full of fetching chroma. Its head is a tarnished ecru and leaves a sticky mess of lacing.  I'm sure Stone has already looked into whether it's possible to legally trademark a smell - this audaciously hoppy aroma is distinguished by the sheer pomposity of its wickedly bitter pithiness and unrivaled piny attributes. It smells like someone set a (Tim Burton-inspired) forest on fire and grinned the singed and seething remains into the bottle.  Imagine encountering a dark, sinister side to pink grapefruit, pine serum and toffee-coated wafers. In fact, Arrogant Bastard is kind of like a vigilante - not everyone will agree with the way it goes about things but few will dispute the overall good brought about. Do its flavours need to be this brazen and excessively bitter? Couldn't we have just had a bright and citric hoppiness without all these harassing, pithy, weedy herbals?  Couldn't we have a leisurely walk through the forest rather than death by a thousand pine needle pin-pricks? Couldn't we have a spritz of citrus rather than being gagged with a festering, entire grapefruit in our mouth? Couldn't we have sweet, toasty biscuits rather than having the sugar scorched directly onto our tongue? In so many words... no.  If you want all smiles and sunshine then look elsewhere because the experience here is not the sunshine, it's the storm weathered. And to hell with smiles. This is about being brash, impertinent, impudent, ill-mannered, unabashed and, in a word, arrogant. This may be the world's most deliberately unappealing flagship beer... which is exactly why it's so popular.  Love it or loath it, this beer does capture a great deal about its brewer: loads of brash character and plenty of clever marketing. And you may be hard-pressed to find a flagship offering with better value, more distinctiveness and this level of decadent maltiness and brimming hoppiness. Love him or loath him, Arrogant Bastard is one cool bad-ass.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,tburus,3.52,"Poured into oversized wine glass.  Appearance: Muted, transparent red color. Light carbonation. Thin but complete head.  Smell: Initially hoppy and citrusy smell with something indiscernible. As it warmed a cherry aroma really came out.  Taste: Clear hoppy taste. Quick cherry flavor, but not nearly as much as the smell had me hoping for. Bitter.  Mouthfeel: Bitterness largely went away unlike IPAs like 90 Minute. A little too watery for my taste. Nothing very enjoyable lingering in the mouth.  Drinkability: Definitely strong, and if you like hops it is probably up your alley. Alcohol really hits you, though not very present in the nose or taste.

Creamy and full-bodied up front with a lot of sticky sweetness, leading to tons of piney hop bitterness on the back end.

147,92,Retsinis,3.7,"Poured from a 22 oz. Bomber.  The bottle art alone is unmistakable, along with the long ""epitaph"" like statements on the back.  On Appearance, it pours a dark copper-brown in color with a good few inches of head that retains well. The head is sticky throughout, and hold to the glass wall. Cloudy haze is also noticeable, even though it is a dark brown.  On Aroma, caramel malt scents are present, but the hops are the most upfront to me. Citrus and grapefruit being the most prevalent.  On Taste, just as with the nose, smooth caramel malt flavor up front, quickly followed by citric hops, finishing with roasted malt notes. The Toasty notes linger on the palate as well, as does the sharp hop flavor.  On Mouth feel, medium, with a light amount of carbonation, but the hop bite make up for that. Alcohol is less noticeable to me, but my ABV average is about 8% lately anyway.  It is quite drinkable.  While the beers reputation is such an established one in the craft beer scene, in my humble opinion, the recipe has been a bit eclipsed by other similar beers in the last few years, but on its own, it is still a solidly good beer, with its flavor profile still being almost unmistakable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The beer isn't astringent in character but rather seems approachable  Taste: Same as above but wow does this beer sit well on my palate. This beer is very sweet but still has a slight hoppy bitterness There is a good balance between the malts and hops. This beer really gives the drinker a sense of the potential of good malts in a beer. The beer finishes sweet and doesn't linger at all. This beer packs a heavy punch but still taste very good.  Mouthfeel: This is good stuff. This beer is full and foams up in my mouth when I swish it around. It's chewy and smooth. This is a great wintertime drink. I can really appreciate a beer like this which doesn't leave me wondering if it has anything to deliver other than a watery taste.  Drinkability: Yep. This beer really delivers. Don't be intimidated by it's name or the menacing looking gargoyle on the bottle. I suppose this beer is wicked in a sense that it really has some strong memorable characteristics. I suppose those strong qualities make it ""arrogant"". This is a great example of a well made American Strong Ale.

Taste is a nice blend of hops with tropical and citrus fruit flavors. Malt flavors as well. Bitter aftertaste. This is a full bodied beer that packs a good amount of flavor while not being to boozey.

T - Flavor explosion. This guy earns his name. Again, the taste is pretty complex, but piney hops and the sting from the alcohol were dominant and fighting for my attention. As I swallow, the sweetness of the malt shines through, though it's still in the shadow of the huge hops. I wouldn't call this a balanced beer. Also, I tasted carrots after I burped. Not sure if that's relevant.  M - Pucker power. Feels thinner than I expected from the appearance, but it's not watery. Just enough carbonation for my taste. The alcohol and carbonation pair up to make for an exciting tingle factor.  D - Not exactly a session beer... I'd say it's a good beer to start off a night with, before switching to something a bit less arrogant.

The smell doesn't even hint at what is to come. Very quiet with only some suggestion that there's malt in this. The color has to tell you otherwise unless it's like that caramel-color-added Newcastle crap. I guess there's some subtle hop aroma too.  The flavor is nearly overwhelming in bitterness. At first there's a pleasant malt flavor, but within seconds that is obliterated by a deep resinous sticky bitterness. Not a lot of complexity in the hops here either. Imagine licking a sap-filled pine tree, but in a good way. Don't get your tongue stuck.  The carbonation is so-so. For the style it's ok, but I prefer it a little less fluffy. The real downer though is the persistent bitterness. No remorse in this one.  Drinkability is ok. Expect to finish your bomber and stop after that. Unless you accidentally purchased a double jeroboam and are by yourself on a Friday night, to which I say good luck sir. See you in the afterlife.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

T: Some of the sweetness reminds me of a red ale with some fruit qualities. Difference is the hop level is more like an APA. The hops themselves taste much more foreign than an APA though.  M: Modest carbonation, a little on the syrupy side.  D: While I don't find it that arrogant or bastardly, I still enjoyed drinking it.

147,92,Andreji,4,"So another one along the lines of Stone, a brewery i've been able to test on various occasions. this time, a 66cl bottle brought from overseas by a good friend and fellow beer lover.  As has happened to me before with the stone brews, the visual aspect is the best of it. Not only starting from its bottling, but the actual pour (into a trappe chalice on hand) is a barely translucent red-brown, almost viscous with a frothy brownish head, fairly thick with a generous lacing left behind.  Smell right off hits you, it's hops, hops and hops, very much in-line with the american style of strong ales. Some caramel-ish flushes come around from within the piney, hoppy feel. nice and complex.  The taste is good but a bit overwhelming. It has a very distinct syrupy feel at first, rather malty and driven to the total, extreme opposite of what overtakes it within seconds- an extremely robust bitterness that almost numbs the palate instantly. While it may hold for a solid pint, the IBUs certainly hit me super-hard and it would be tough to sip and session this one. It also lacks the distinct woody musky feel the OAB has, which certainly makes it a better beer in my opinion. Nonetheless, this one is quite a worthy sample of its style, and a good beer by Stone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,xnicknj,4.33,"on tap at the spot in point.  Pours a deep red with cherry and burnt hues. A larger off-white head bubbles up, retains well, and leaves crazy amounts of lacing on the glass.  A nice bouquet of dark dried fruit, burnt sugar, hop bitterness, and a hint of alcohol in the nose.  Begins with a nice punch of hop bitterness, followed by a faint sweetness due to dark fruit. An earthy malt backbone supports the beer with brown sugar and caramel. Hints of cherry peek through. Another wave of bitter hops continue towards the end, along with a faint bite of alcohol.  Fuller medium body, a little dry and sticky feel, but very drinkable. The alcohol is masked really well, and you can easily have a couple of these before feeling satisfied.

147,92,elton044,4.1,"This particular brew itself proclaims ""you're not worthy."" We'll see.  This proclamation should be respected. I have taken the Stone Brewing Company tour in Escondido, California and I am his.  My Los Angeles-transplant brother, Nick, opened my eyes to this bit of hops enlightenment. While on the brewery tour at Stone, I had the dubious pleasure of being the ""lucky"" soul singled out to ingest the concentrated hop pellet that they utilize, in front of all my fellow tourmates no less. Arrogant Bastard? Yeah, something like that.  The hop notes of this take-no-prisoners creation permeate all aspects from smell to aftertaste. Is that a bad thing? No, I say!  The pour into my less than ideal pint glass was pleasantly dark and full of a rich, hoppy aroma with just a hint of roasted barley. The somewhat thin, light tannish to beige head spread its legs down the rim of my glass wholly without shame. Get the idea?  The smell? Hops. Fruit notes? No. Hops. Citrus notes? Not really. Hops. Caramel notes? Nope. Hops. Savvy? This offering will arrive at your nose with an unkempt gang of hops in tow and will NOT apologize for doing so... and I wouldn't have it ANY other way!  The mouth feel and taste are both quite aggressive, as advertised. The hoppy flavor will latch onto your palate and won't let go. Delightful. However, this is a product you must be in the mood for. What it lacks in sheer drinkability, it more than makes up for in ""shock value"" and intensity. I find that one to two 22 ounce bottles are more than enough to satiate my beer desires in a given session.  This level of brew could only benefit from barreling/aging. Thankfully, the good folks at Stone have concocted the Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale varietal.

This has a very natural beer smell if that makes any sense. not to overdone with ingredients and processes.  T - Smooth, yet bitter. Once again, there are hints of a caramel sweetness but the full bodies malt aspect is what drives this brew. There is definately an alcohol bite to this one as well.  M - This one is very thick, definately leaves a couring on the mouth/tongue. Overall, well done.  D - I would come back to this beer eventualy, but maybe not right away as there are no individual qualities that demand its consumption over other beers.

147,92,Jwaks,2.14,"Each time I try this beer, I recall how awful, undrinkable, unpleasing and unbalanced it is. This beer makes me think it is a small west coast american barleywine that may never find a good drinking window. Hop flavor and bitterness is way over the top with some ""lip service"" malt struggling yet failing horriby to balance the beer. What makes it worse is the assertive and undeniably unpleasant bitterness that lingers far after the first sip. It's anything but pleasing or appetizing making the beer nearly undrinkable.  I admit fully to shitting all over this beer, it's deserved even though it has few small redemeing qualities. One being it's a first in american strong ale craft beers and helped redefine how many americans see and experience beer. I resepect and appreciate what arrogant bastard ale and stone has done to foward craft beer and redefine beer for the majority of beer drinkers. Second, it's an awesome show of american hops even if I disagree with the chosen hop varietys and use; they are clearly at odds with the malt base and their excessive use is way over the top creating disjointed flavors and lack of harmony in the final product.  This beer was not brewed or intended to be a great beer, but only as an over the top small west coast barleywine to match a gimmiky, catchy marketing ploy designed to challenge fizzy yellow beer and micro drinkers alike to try something ""better."" If there is a FIAT beer, like the US dollar, something that has value only because it or someone says it does, this is it.  Thanks, Stone, but I know you can do better in the American Strong Ale category if you tried to brew a good beer and not sell marketing with a token beer to go with.

Slight amount of malt, and it didn't interfere with the hops and bitterness, but gave the drink a lot more character by being there. More on the bitter side which is how I like it. All aspects of the taste are balanced so well. There are notes of roasted and burnt malts, and it's quite elaborate. Tastes like an IPA base with some of the character you see in porters. Coffee and chocolate were deep in this one and quite subtle.  M- Creamy and smooth. Medium full body. Slightly dry and sticky finish.  D- Aggressive taste, while easy to drink and even subtle at times. The cockiness on the back of the label was justified. There is 7.2% of alcohol in it, but I forgot about that with all the flavor.

You can sense a real strong malt backbone, but the citrusy hop aroma lets you know what's coming.  It turns out to be a somewhat complex beer, still dominated by bitter hops and a lingering citrusy sort of flavor. It's a good one.  This drinks and feels good.

Stone thought it would be a good idea to add double of EVERYTHING and it works amazingly well.

147,92,drseamus,4.12,"The intimidation starts even before the bottle has even been opened. Quoting the essay on the back of the bottle, it warns, ""This is an aggressive beer. You probably won't like it."" It then proceeds to berate both the reader and ""fizzy yellow beer"" throughout the paragraph. Sarcasm aside, for more than half the drinking age adults in the country, the bottle is probably right. This is an aggressive beer from a company known for aggressive beers.  Arrogant Bastard was an extreme beer before the term existed. The style ""American Strong Ale"" is just a catch-all for high-alcohol beers that refuse to fit into another style, but this beer is essentially a strong barleywine. An English barleywine is typically malt driven, being more sweet than bitter. An American barleywine, like many things American, is more bitter than sweet. This is certainly closer to the latter. It has a healthy dose of malt and body but a more than generous amount of hop bitterness that easily takes center stage. Even after the beer has left your mouth, the residual bitterness lasts as a reminder of the pleasurable pummeling your palate endured.  For anyone that manages to make it through the entire bottle alive, there is always Double Bastard left to conquer. The first lines of the tome on that bottle read, ""This is one lacerative muther [sic] of a beer. It is unequivocally certain that your feeble palate is grossly inadequate and thus undeserving of this liquid glory...""",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The head slowly goes away and leaves little onion-looking guys and some big old bubbles in the film that retains on top of the beer. Thick, chunky lacing coats the side of my glass.  S: A grassy, citrus hop smell leaps out of the glass and into my nose. Lemon, lime, and orange meld with freshly cut grass to create a great, fresh smell. A caramel malt backbone adds a thick sweetness to the smell and the house yeast contributes a dry biscuit presence.  T: The citrus, grass, and bitter hops assert their bold flavor immediately, then the caramel malt mellows out the flavor until the bittering hops kick in and leave my mouth with a very dry, tobacco-like aftertaste.  M: The feel of this beer is varied and intriguing. The hops ride their bitterness bike all over my mouth for the duration of the sip, while the sweeter malt element provide a nice coating, medium bodied experience for my palate.  D: Arrogant Bastard has a really enjoyable flavor and a solid mouthfeel that lead to a solid beer that I will enjoy many more times in the future.

A little bit of toasted and burnt malts are present. Slightly citrus like but not a lot to ruin the complex aromas going on. A thick tasting brew to begin with. Tastes like molasses and finishes with brown sugar. Starts dry & ends slightly bitter. I dig the toasty quality of the malts. Caramel quite evident but has a good dose of roast. As noted previously, this is quite a nice complex beer to sip & savor. Alcohol warmth a little noticeable which makes me think the drinkability isn't all that high.  Update: had this again on Thanksgiving night 11/28/13. Bought a 22 at Pinnocchio's in Media for $6. Enjoy by date = 1/4/14.

Pours a clear brown in the pint glass....head of about 1/2 inch or so...pretty good retention.  Taste is a pretty good marriage of sweet, caramel and toffee malts plus a pretty good degree of pine bitterness much like that found in a standard IPA. The sweetness hits first and is quickly joined by the hoppiness. The bitterness lasts well into the aftertaste with a citrus peel kind of character....a little smacking sweetness also hangs around. Alcohol is completely masked. Mouthfeel is fairly thick. I'm impressed with the balance here. It's really a struggle between the sweet malts and the hops and while the hops really do ""win"" by being a bit more aggressive than the malts, it's still pretty well balanced.

I let this warm up some more and I am getting a walnut/pecan pie smell off of it now, it is delightful.  Taste - Good match of malt and hop flavors. The hop flavors aren't really citrus to me, more of a grassy with hints of pine. Getting a sweet taste now that it is warming, I almost want to call it maple like someone else mentioned, but I am unsure because it is a faint flavor.  Mouthfeel - Pretty decent mouth feel, this bottle was a little over carbonated, but not too bad.  Drink - Pretty enjoyable to drink. Not sure I'd want to down another bomber, but I am enjoying it none the less.  I decided it was time to revisit this, as I have only had this twice before. Once was when I wasn't into beer at all and I thought it was a scary beer. The second time was right after I got into beer and it seemed over hopped.

It's perfectly laced and the head retains great. The beer is a deep-red color that just makes me want to drink it all.  Smell: Hoppy, nutty and a few spices. There's just a hint of grapefruit in there.  Taste: Tastes very good! Hits smoky, malty and hoppy, then a few spices come in, and the grapefruit makes its appearance at the end. Very well-balanced.  Mouthfeel: Lightly carbonated and feels pretty thick on the tongue, but goes down the throat nice and bubbly.  Drinkability: Surprisingly easy to drink, there's really no issue finishing a bomber of this. Can barely feel the 7.2% alcohol.  A great, widely available choice. The ""arrogance"" is perhaps a little out of hand though, I think this'd be a great choice for someone just getting into craft beers.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Rich clear dark red/amber color with a grand action of tiny bubbles making their way to the surface. Color rates a 31 on the SRM chart. Smell is intense malt, wheat, citrus and hops. Very rich balanced taste of wheat and lime with a finish of hops, this stuff is good. The citrus and hops remains on the back of my tongue for a good 30 seconds after the brew has gone down my throat. Creamy and tingly feel in my mouth and back of my throat as I drink.

The smell is like freshly baked bread. I have had this bottle for a while so I am thinking some of the hop smell has burned off.  My first impression is happiness regarding the hoppiness of this brew. A good deal of bready malts head up the taste with ample west coast pine/lemon hops. Within the taste is a roasted barley flavor that blends well into the hop profile. I am also getting some grassy and celery like flavors from the hops. The residual taste is rather bitter and pleasant.  This beer has a unique affect of coating the mouth with a sticky feel. It is full in the mouth with plenty of carbonation to tingle the tongue.  I would say that this is not the most drinkable beer, especially for its ABV. The complexity of this brew keeps me sipping away.

The color is deep copper bordering on bronze w/ murky appearance and thick whipped up inch of light beige. There are rings of lace clinging after the first sip so retention and lacing are good.  The smell has mild hooppy aroma w/ light pine odor when I first checked, but it was served very cold. As the beer warms more malt w/ mild caramel and toasted notes come forward and a mild alcohol note is apparent closer to cellar temp  The feel is mildly creamy on entry w/ high bitterness and a warming feel w/ slightly high stickiness on the palate w/ a dry finish. The bitterness lasts long after the swallow  The taste of the strong ale has strong piney hop flavor w/ herbal accent and slight woody note w/ caramel taste under the highly bitter hop flavors. There is a slight creamy yeast tinge w/ mild stone fruit in the taste as it goes down. The taste is very aggressive and almost biting w/ a very grassy sharp taste that doesn't mess around. You can feel the stomach acid in action after the beer is consumed when tasted on an empty stomach.  A good west coast strong ale w/ lots of bitterness that makes it a challenge for me to have more than a couple. The acidity seems to linger, but it achieves its goal -arrogance.

The body of the brew is almost a ruby red in color.  It's a stone product for sure when it comes to the hopping and that is the first thing you get in the nose big old pine and citrus hops. The pretty much dominate the nose. The flavor is not as one dimensional as one would expect from Stone. They sometimes forget the malts in their products I think but this brew is more balanced. You get a nice malt sweetness from it I find myself at times thinking maybe it is a little too sweet. The brew had medium body and carbonation to it.

A clear clean reddish chestnut brown colour which is topped by a dense multi layered head. And as I drank this, probably faster than I should have, the beer left some of the thickest clinging lacing I can remember.

However I can't blame them, nearly every American beer drinker I know, who is a step above macrobrew garbage, is a hophead! They just must be catering to the consumer but not so much so that non-hopheads can't enjoy as well.  mouthfeel; sharp carbonation takes away any watery qualities, almost some thickness but no, I think it's the alcohol numbing my tongue. Very nice, perhabs the most memorable feature.  drinkability; one is enough! I'd drink Doppelbock in excess before this.

147,92,eclaycamp,4.6,"Living in Kansas, I don't often have the opportunity to get great fresh beer from the coasts. Sure, we have access to big breweries like Sierra Nevada, Rogue, and Samuel Adams, but we don't have access to those ""chic"" breweries. One such name is Stone, a brewery that I've always admired from afar but never had the opportunity to sample. On a recent trip to Denver I made it a point to seek out a bevy of beers that I just can't get here locally, including several from Stone. For tonight, I figured that I may as well start with the beer that is arguably Stone's most famous, Arrogant Bastard. I have to admit that I'm both nervous and excited to try this beer. This one is a 22 ounce bomber, with the famous Stone Gargoyle on the front. As if I wasn't intimidated enough there's the phrase ""You're Not Worthy"" greeting me as I crack the bottle open.  I'm treating this beer as I would a Belgian, as surprisingly outside the name I know very little about it. So that means that I'm using my Chimay chalice. Blasphemy you say? Well, considering the name is Arrogant Bastard, I figured it appropriate. Pours similarly to a Belgian beer as well, a deep amber color. The color is the first thing that surprises me about this beer, as it's much darker, bordering on brown, than I expected. Half inch head that dissipates but leaves a fine bubbly lacing along the sides of the glass. Nice.  Aroma is surprisingly malty. Considering Stone's profile (i.e. California, I was expecting this to be quite hoppy, but again that's not the case. It's a complex smell, and my first thought was of pretzels, like the big soft pretzels you can get on a street corner. There's some sweetness to the malt aroma as well, kind of like a French loaf or something similar. I want to say that there are some faint fruit aromas, like figs or other dark fruits. This aroma is just fantastic. I could smell it all day.  Mouthfeel is pretty tremendous. It's thick without being syrupy, full without being sticky. While the hops were not present in the nose there's this super huge lingering bitterness that smothers your palate, choking it from the front to the back with your first drink. And again, the Arrogant Bastard surprises me, as it tastes like nothing I was expecting. There's this huge, full-on malt sweetness up front, which gives way to a dryness before heading into the bitterness at the end. I attribute the middle dryness to house character that seems to be present in all of Stone's beers. When tasting the beer I'm surprised at how fruity it really is, as I get these huge hits of raisin and fig on my palate. What's amazing is how the sweetness just evaporates in the middle, giving way to this dryness and then the big bitterness. It's a really incredible feat to move from the sweet to dry realm so quickly.  This is a Belgian beer without the Belgian yeast. Arrogant Bastard only gets better the longer you let it warm up. The fruit flavors and malt profile are amplified the closer that it gets to room temperature. It's a delicious beer, and I can easily see why so many people enjoy it. Overall I'm quite impressed with it, and I have absolutely nothing to add but ""wow.""",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I can see, if not explain, why they invented a style for it.  Mouthfeel 5/5 Medium body that balances the bitterness well. The carbonation level would propel it to the crisp category.

147,92,PinataRobot,4.72,"First review, so I think I would make it of the best beer i've tried recently...  Tried this on a recent trip to San Diego, not used to the massive selection since I come from an area that is mostly BMC dominated and it's hard to find craft stuff. I remember reading a few excellent reviews of this, and the name really stands out on a page, so I ordered one from the bartender, who seemed pleased with the selection.  Came to me in a Pint Glass, held it up to the light, almost completely opaque and creamy looking. The head was about 2 fingers tall, a little fizzy and off-white, head started disappearing quickly, but left nice lacing all around.  A - This was totally great looking, love the darkness, head fizzed out and made way for just the beer rather quickly.  S- Powerful, black pepper, cedar/woodsy, coffee. It's very strong, and very bitter smelling, the hops is very dense. I like this a lot, it's a very heavy smell.  T- Amazing. The bitterness is powerful, the hops washes over my tongue and I can see why this is so highly rated. It's a nice strong flavor that is full of spiciness, bitterness, and sweetness all at the same time.  M - Feels really nice, leaves a great feeling, and an aftertaste that lingers with the liquid that remains.  D - This is a great beer, everything about it was spot on.

Appearance is deep mahogany color, reddish amber as you hold it up to the light. Half inch tan head that slides down ever so slowly, leaving some serious lacing. Smell is full of piney hops, with some undertones of sweet caramel malts as well as some citrus notes. Quite nice.  Can definitely taste that pine in the initial sip, with just a bit of malt before the hoppy bitterness steps in and overrides pretty much everything. Strong, strong hop bitterness. I'm able to pick out some more subdued malty notes as well as some citrus nuances. Finish is bitter, bitter, bitter with just a hint of alcohol that becomes more noticeable as the brew warms. Absolutely coats the tongue. It lingers long into the aftertaste. Definitely deserves the 'strong' classification. Mouthfeel is firm and solid, with a good amount of carbonation. No qualms with that.  Drinkability is certainly better than a BMC offering, but the bitterness definitely takes some getting used to. It absolutely lives up to its moniker, as this beer is definitely arrogant, definitely strong, almost brutal.

I'm still pretty new to the reviewing game, so here goes!  Bottle Appearance: Very cool bottle, and the humor on the labels makes it quite a good laugh to read. My favorite quote being on the case ""Keep Refrigerated, Numbskull!""  Appearance: Very nice looking beer out of the bottle, leaves a very nice head, that hangs around quite a while, and leaves very nice lacing. Almost a copper red color to it, and the head was a nice tan.  Smell: Very strong scent of pine (because of the hops, I believe) However, there are other scents intermingling. I smelled also a bit of malt to it, almost like a caramel scent, and also a hint of a lemon zest to it, there is also a slightly roasted malt quality to it too, which gives a very nice depth to the scent.  Taste: Very hoppy. There is a taste of citrus that appears also with the hops.The malt does a great job balancing it out, and only gets bitter at the finish. I get almost a piney taste at first, and then the flavor simply explodes, lemon zest and hints of caramel in the beer, it's absolutely a joy to the senses, The finish of the beer is very dry. However, all the flavors are quite strong, which may scare some people away.  Mouthfeel: There was a bit of carbonation to it, which gave the beer a very interesting mouthfeel, the beer would almost coat the palate.  Drinkability: I find it to be pretty drinkable, however the strong flavor profile definitely doesn't make this a session beer (at least to me).

This special cask version had a buttery taste and texture, with just the merest hint of wood.

The aroma is a mix of earthy and slightly zesty citrus hops and complex malts. The malt bill is very caramel heavy with some nice dark fruity notes in there as well as a bit of roastyness.  The flavor is very nice with plenty going on and all flavors complimenting each other. Earthy, slightly grassy hops mingle with lemon zest. Caramel and mildly roasted malt combine to form a very interesting and savor worthy malt flavor. This beer seems to be quite bitter, but the malt is up to the task of holding up all that bitterness, only allowing it to come through in the finish.  The mouthfeel is medium with a super dry finish that might be the biggest weakness of this beer. After swallowing sticky dryness takes over my tongue and overly dank hops linger on my palate.  Drinkability is an interesting category for this beer. You would think with the ABV that it would go down fairly easily (for me at least) but I find myself savoring it because of all that is going on.

147,92,stakem,4,"I am kind of confused why I don't already have a review up for this. I have consumed it on many occasions and I guess it just goes to the way side with paying more attention or picking the double bastard or the oaked version when it is available. Oh well, here goes.  Poured from a bomber into a fitting stone pint glass. For the life of me I can't make out the best by date on the bottle but I believe it to say by the end of this month. AB appears a clear amber color with 2 fingers of creamy head that is tanned but has a bit of yellow about it as well. The cap of foam retains well but as it receeds, sticks around the glass with quite a bit of patchy lace.  The aroma of this brew is a pleasant mixture of hops meets malt. There is a sweetness about the nose that suggests carmelized sugars and it blends very well with the hops. The hops come forward with a scent of oranges and pine with a little bit of floral aspect about it as well. Just smelling this brew is very deceiving, it smells like this brew is going to be sweet.  The flavor of this brew includes toasty malt that is a bit like carmelized sugars leaning toward a bit of smokiness. The hops are resinous with a flavor of pine and orange rind. There is a false sense of vanilla-like sweetness before the bitterness of the hops comes back in to pierce the tongue. The hops cling in the mouth and stick long into the finish. Quite a bold presense of alcohol is included and meshes very well with the flavors of the toasty malt and hops.  This is a medium bodied brew with moderate level of carbonation. Well rounded and overall just a good example of how enjoyable hops can be when done right with a modest amount of malt and moderate abv to back it. About the only thing holding this brew back from being super drinkable is the bold character of the alcohol, there are beers with twice as much abv that are not this forward with the alcohol presence. Regardless, the name of this brew is quite fitting. A must try.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

It's probably too strong in flavor to really give to any kind of newbie.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,HURTemHIZZY,4.33,"Awesome brew. Pours a deep slightly reddish amber with a 2 and a half finger light tan head that has nice retention. Leaves a bit of lacing behind. Smells of pine and citrus, nice hop profile. Taste has the pine and citrus as well, with a touch of grapefruit, but it has a nice caramel malt body that really balances this beer. This is a classic. My girlfriend doesn't ordinarily like really hoppy brews but this one actually didn't bother her. A classic go-to in my book.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jsprain1,4.4,"A- Pours a redish amber. Head is something darker than eggshell, with good retention and a ton of lacing. S- Smell is of citrus, particularly grapefruit, and brown sugar. Splendid. T- Very much like the aroma but brutally aggressive. It literally feels like a kick to the tongue. Citrusy, grapefruity, slightly boozy. M- Medium bodied, slightly high carbonation, but I actually found this refreshing in this beer's case. D- Absolutely a great beer. It was arrogant and it was a bastard. A definite sipping brew. But one wonders, can a beer be too intense? The label says I'm not worthy. I felt worthy. But I don't feel worthy or capable of drinking another. My taste buds would certainly tap out.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

S- Full-bodied abbey ale aroma. Very malty and sweet with a heavy juniper-berry note.  T- Full-bodied with a strong hop bitterness. Alchohol and juniper notes come out. Malty. This beer has a nice floral quality about it. They advertise it as being impossible to drink, but for a beer drinker who likes bold flavour, this beer is just right.  M- Medium-heavy body with dry mouthfeel. You taste the tang of carbonation more than you see in the glass. Lingering bitter with juniper notes stick around.

147,92,cjacobsen,4.17,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass  Pours a rich red, really dark copper color. Fantastic off white head that leaves lacing from start to finish. This beer sticks to you like a fat kid to a buffet.  Smells of hops and spice. Very rich aroma that hits the nostrils strong.  The taste is unique, thats what I love about this beer. It stands out. Hits your tongue with hops and and bitters and demolishes all the way down. Leaves you feeling like you drank something worth your time.  Its a bit harsh on the palette, especially the first time around. If you're a red fan or a belgian strong ale fan, this beer is a must.  This isn't an all night sipper and its not something you want to down a great deal of. This brew is sure to kick you where it counts but leaves you satisfied and feeling like you know what a true craft beer tastes like.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,vandemonian,3.96,"This beer has a lovely appearance. It is amber read in colour and it pours with a nice head that lasts for a minute or two. It has a hoppy, fruity smell. Basically, by this stage, you'll really want to taste it.  Arrogant Bastard Ale lives up to it's name, with an aggressively hoppy taste that is similar to the smell but ramped up to 11. The taste stays consistent until you get to the aftertaste, which is appropriately bitter (how every encounter with an arrogant bastard ends).  The beer is mildly carbonated and goes down nicely with an accompaniment.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Smells like the outdoors: a bit piney, little bit of sweetness.  Tastes like a suped up dopplebock. Pretty strong roasty malt flavor with a bit of a lingering smoky after-taste. Tastes quite boozy which knocks down the drinkability for me but I still want to keep gettin' sips in as it's pretty damn delicious.  The bottle is pretty cool the stone demon and stuff that's on it. The back description is a bit pretentious but probably makes some beer geeks feel high and mighty for enjoying it.

147,92,Stigs,3.68,"an old classic...one of my first craft beers. been awhile so i ordered a 16oz pour at fatheads, english-style pint glass.  A - bit over a finger of frothy, very light tan colored foam which just wouldnt go away. already covering the glass with a thin film which eventually sticks to it like glue. the beer is dark, dark amber in color and relatively clear. impressive.  S - hops, very heavy on the pine with a slightly citrusy sweet vibe at the end. sharp sweet caramel malt struggles for attention.  T - sharp and dark roasted malts coat the tongue before a massively bitter piney hop attack. hints of grapefruit and a lightly floral touch as well. a little one sided and everything seems to be fighting for attention at once instead of playing nicely.  M - a bit astringent...i know its meant to be bitter but with the aid of strong prickly carbonation it distracts from the flavors a bit. very dry finish with lingering piney bitterness.  D - arrogant indeed. right up a lot of craft drinker's alley, and i like them as hoppy and robust as they come but this is just lacking some grace, control. too many bold flavors at once do not leave much room for anything else. hits the spot on certain days, this must not be one of them.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ambluhm,4.11,"The appearance of this beer is gorgeous. It pours a rich reddish/amber color. The head was thick with a coffee colored deliciousness... mmm.  The nose of this beer definitely shows a strong presence of hops. There is some citrus and floral notes as well as a faint, faint hint of sweet caramel smelling malts.  The mouthfeel is definitely bitter. The first sip will put a wallop on your tongue, but there is enough malt character to balance the bite. A real nice texture.  Overall, this is most certainly a beer I would drink again. It won't be something you could have a bunch of, but is certainly a well-crafted and delicious brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Whiteweasel,4,"Drank from a pint glass poured from on tap at Prarie Moon.  A: Deep red, brownish. Hazy but very bubbly. Really an incredible head, and significant, almost artistic lacing.  S: Very hoppy smelling, yet balanced with some amount of maltiness. Light booze is clearly evident on the nose. This one should be a doozy.  T: Dominant flavours are roasted malt and toastiness. Contrary to the smell, hoppiness is more subdued, though still plays a prominant role. Has quite the nutty aftertaste.  M: Its a tad boozy, not suprisingly since it is 7.2 abv. Quite bubbly. Decent aftertaste  D: Too high abv to session. Don't finish your night with this beer. It'll knock you on your ass. Very interesting though, and I wish I could session it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,LacquerHead,4.03,"It poured an amber color, more on the red side with a 3finger head of foam that settled to less than an inch and never went away. (Poured this into a Sam Adams pint)  S: Floral hops dominated the aroma, but it was not too pungent. There was also a smell that reminded me of pine cones.  T: Bitter, but not obnoxiously bitter. Behind the bitterness there was a floral pine taste. There was also a bitter citric flavor - not necessarily grapefruit, but close. At colder temps the bitterness and the hops were very pronounced. As it warmed, however, the malts began to cut through. There was a nutty brown sugar malt flavor that lingered about aiding the hops.  M/F: bitter aftertaste that lingers for a while. Very pale. As it gets warmer the a malty profile develops giving it a little sweeter texture.  D: good drinkability when I'm looking for a hoppy bitter beer. I typically drink this at bars, and usually it's only two or three pints. I don't really buy the bomber anymore.  Overall, a good revisiting of an old beer I use to drink a lot of. It has never let me down. I like suggesting this to people I'm with at a bar: they order it and go, ""ugh what is this!"" They take 3-4drinks then they pass the beer to me and I finish it for them free of charge. Then they order their usual swill macro and give me a mouth-smacking look like, ""ugh the bitterness wont go away, how can you drink that stuff."" Ho Ho!

Pours a deep, hazy amber brown, very cola-ish, with a small thick beige head that recedes to a hefty cap and leaves some clings streaks of lacing.  The aroma is very hoppy with bright citrus, including lemons and tangerines, and some floral pine. There is a light malty sweetness in the background but the hops are dominant in the nose.  The hops lead the charge in the taste as well with bitter/tart lemon zest up front. The backbone is malty with lots of caramel and toasted malts. But the sweetness is swept away again in the finish, which leaves a dry hoppy bitterness.  The mouthfeel is bitter, dry and prickly with the bright citrus leaving a nice coating on the tongue. Moderate carbonation and medium body overall.  This is a very tasty beer, especially given it's relatively low ABV, and the hops are the main attraction here.

147,92,StephenRich,4.2,"After being teased by Stone's Oakquinox festival which I cannot attend, and happens to be on my birthday, I have been in a Stone mood. So lets take a look at one of the most outrageous beer labels to exist, and also one of Americas best selling pale ales, the Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale.  Stone certainly does not beat around the bush with this one. This is what is printed quite clearly on the back of the bottle:  ""This is an aggressive beer. You probably won't like it. It is quite doubtful that you have the taste or sophistication to be able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth. We would suggest that you stick to a safer and more familiar territory - maybe something with a multi-million dollar ad campaign aimed at convincing you it's made in a little brewery, or one that implies that their tasteless fizzy yellow beer will give you more sex appeal. Perhaps you think multi-million dollar ad campaigns will make a beer taste better. Perhaps you're mouthing you words as you read this.""  They have produced an American Strong Ale bearing very close to a Double IPA, and yes, they are aware than some people may not be able to handle it, but no, they don't care. I do think that the marketing behind this beer, whether intentional or not (and I bet not), is practical genius. There is something about its arrogance that draws to me it and makes me want it. And really, anyone who sees it pretty much wants to try it! Its kind of like that cocky jerk in the corner of the bar with his collar popped surrounded by a pack of girls. You know he's just an arrogant bastard, but somehow that lours them in.  This Arrogant Bastard was able to reel me in and seduce me with its rich powerful malt and hop flavors. It is certainly extremely pungent and not for the faint of heart. But its nothing insane, at 7.2% abv it is right in the mid range among Strong American Pale Ales. It is available widely throughout the United States in 650 ml bottles, but somehow I doubt that the LCBO will ever allow a bottle like this on their shelves... Just a guess.  The Bastard is a fiery amber red beer with golden browns shining through it. It lift a nice deep and pollowy one and a half inch head richly on top of the surface. Head retention was quite powerful; a short half inch head relaxed with me the entire time I enjoyed it.  The nose is vastly rich and complex, but most apparent are west coast hops. Fresh grapefruit, apricots, pine and woody hops erupt in your nose with a huge floral impact. Warm pale and caramel malts are playing in behind with a soft toasted nut character, spices and earth. The nose is very full and very complex with layers of soft and rich aromas. Overall it prepares you for a full flavored beer, but does not scare your palate.  You shouldn't sip this beer, don't let it intimidate you - get right in there and get a nice full mouthful. Loads of crisp bitter hops pour over your tongue and invade your cheeks brining with it huge pine and citrus grapefruit, solid caramel and light oak malts. Nothing hides or waits for you here, all the flavors come right away and make themselves known, as the bottle does predict. When cold, mostly the bitter-rich hops are what pour out at you, but as the beer gets closer to cellar temperature warm malts show layers of toffee, warm bread, herbs, pepper, clove and a hint of cinnamon.  The mouthfeel is really soft and smooth without letting carbonation attach your palate. Its a nice contrast to the aggressive flavors here and actually suits it quite well. It has a mild oil like characteristic and glides over your palate soothing and caressing your taste buds. The finish is crisp, warm, and still full. But it is very quenching and would be amazing with a huge range of foods; go for red grilled meats, fried anything, heavy cheese, breads, pizza, meaty pasta, or chocolate.  Although it seems menacing, the alcohol is balanced and hidden within the beer, the aggressive flavors are mirrored by floral herbs and spices, and the drinkability of the beer is superb. I would never hesitate to buy a bottle, and soon will post a discussion of the Double Bastard!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,zhanson88,4.03,"Appearance: Dark amber color with copper highlights, with a couple fingers of off white head that really sticks around and clings to the edges of the glass. Great looking beer.  Smell: Toasted malts and strong hoppy aromas are by far the most prevalent in this one. A bit of caramel as well. Not the most complex, but there are certainly some big aromas that waft up.  Taste: Right off the bat there is a lot of toasted malt flavor, followed by loads of hops. Also some cherry-like fruits and caramel. The flavor profile is huge and fairly complex.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with pretty smooth carbonation. Very nice feel in the mouth, overall.

Great retention.  S - Good nose on this one. Herbal hops, grass and maybe some lemon mixed in there. Pretty strong. Makes me look forward to taking my first sip.  T - Very complex taste. Hits you hard with a plentiful hoppy taste. Then gives way to a different kind of hop taste. This one a little more subtle. After that there is a great whirlwind of after taste for lack of a better term. At first i thought it was just going to be a regular pale ale but its a pleasant grass, pine, lemon and hops after taste that keeps you wanting another sip.  M - Very, Very smooth. Close to perfect.

A malty sweetness seems to come through a bit providing a nice base for the hops.  The taste also shows a bold citrus and pine hoppiness to it with even more pine coming through in the finish. The malty, caramel, sweetness helps it from becoming overly bitter in the finish. It's big and bold and has a great mix of flavors.  The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability is very good, it's an excellent beer with a lot of bold flavors.

147,92,TheHopMonster,4.55,One of the best brews out there thanks to Stone Brewery.  The appearance is almost considered beautiful in my opinion. It has a magnificent red tint and an amazing looking foam head but just like most Stone brews it is a bit carbonated and bubbly when first poured.  The aromas are definitely caramel with a hint of pine. The smell of the alcohol is covered up by the intense aromas of the hops and malts which make it even more enticing than its appearance.  The taste of this beer is absolutely mind blowing. You can pick out the flavors so easily and it almost seems to change flavors as you get deeper and deeper into the glass.  One of my most favorite ales by far. Good job Stone Brewery,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

But the die down and you get the nice warm sensation of apricots, or at least I think that is what I taste. Wow this has a lot of flavor. Lots of good flavor. This is a really good beer. I am worthy.

T- The green herbal and citrusy hops have green grapefruit zest notes and a nice pine bite to it. There was just a bit of grassy flavor but not much. The malt was a nice sweet malt with some toasted flavors and caramel qualities. The hop bitterness finished the beer and lingered a bit after each sip. M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with a soft fizz that boost the hop finish and no alcohol heat noticed. D- I'm not sure I could distinguish between this and the regular AB but it as a great beer.

Tastes nice; the hops are not as powerful as in their Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale, which makes me like this one more. There's pine, there's white grapefruit, there's a slight hint of caramel from the roasted malt - in combination, it's quite well done. East coast bias gone. I'd compare it favorably to Weyerbacher's Double Simcoe IPA. I might have to get some friends together and do a taste-off of some sort...

Right upfront in the smell is a woodsy caramel scent. In other terms, it has a crisp piney hop smell with a nice malt backbone.  The taste is very aggressive.. almost arrogantly aggressive. The flavor is a like a rush onto the palate. You almost miss the flavors if you're not paying attention. There is a quick sweet bready flavor that draws your attention for a brief second. Then you are blind side punched by a very grassy hop shot. It finishes bitter, and the bitterness lingers for a while. Until the next sip that is!

You probably won't like it. It is quite doubtful that you have the taste or sophistication to be able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth.

Perhaps you think multi-million dollar ad campaigns make a beer taste better. Perhaps you're mouthing your words as you read this.""  Appearance: A mahogany brown with deep red highlights.

Taste: Big malty sweetness with prominent caramel notes. caramel, Toasted/roasted flavors hang in the background swathed in a layer of prickly alcohol. The hop profile has a raw, coarse quality to it that's all the more visceral. Finishes with a lingering sweetness, caramel, and grainy, roasted coffee.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and very smooth.

Frankly, this is an overflavored beer. That said, the flavors are nice, such as they are, there's no subtlety possible here--it's massive malts and more massive hops.

147,92,jporf911,4.54,"I have to admit, I'm simultaneously nervous and excited about this one. When the label says ""You're not worthy"" with a bombastic-looking demon holding an overflowing mug, and the bottle cap says ""Hated by many; Loved by few"", I take that as a challenge, and I never back down from a challenge (unless it involves decapitation or rabid farm animals).  Poured from a 22oz bottle into a traditional glass. No freshness date provided.  Appearance- 4 out of 5. Well, with its almost opaque-brown darkness and ruby hue when held up to the light, it definitely looks demonic. The head is brownish-tan and strong but not overly large. A few swirls around the glass leave nice lacing on the side, and the carbonation bubbles erupt from the bottom with an unnatural vigor that soon subsides, as does the head.  Smell- 5 out of 5. As soon as I cracked open the bottle, before even pouring it, the smell of this beer intrigued me immensely. The bitter hops are coarse but strong, as are the toasted grains from the malt. It's hard to tell exactly what the malt reminds me of, but I'd have to venture caramel as my guess. There is a strong smell of citrus, which is surprising considering how dark the beer is. I also detect green apple and pine. This beer wasn't lying about being aggressive. It smells incredible.  Taste- 4.5 out of 5. It tastes incredible as well. Those ""many"" who the bottle cap claims hate this beer must have had their tongues cut out (or must have been incorrigible drinkers of Bud Light with no taste for quality beer). The initial taste is toasted caramel malt sweetness and tart citrus on the tongue, followed almost instantaneously by tart apple and smooth chocolate. The finishing note is full of powerfully bitter hops, yet all of the taste continue to mingle on the tongue long after swallowing. I lost track of the alcohol in the cacophonous wave of flavors. It's one hell of a strange combination, but by god, it works.  Mouthfeel- 4 out of 5. Solidly medium, crisp upon entering, wet upon swallowing.  Drinkability- 4.5 out of 5. This stuff is amazing. It has every right to be arrogant. With its complexity and wild flavor, I'm honestly surprised they pulled this off-- surprised and pleased. At $4.49 for a 22oz bottle, it's a damned good deal for a beer of this caliber.

147,92,Boxus,4.22,"I've been meaning to review this one for a while, since it's another mainstay for me.  Arrogant Bastard is aggressive, though it's certainly not the most arrogant beer out there. It succeeds by balancing exaggerated hop intensity with a well-rounded roast of caramel malts and sweet fruity pine flavor. It's a beer made for arrogant bastards like us who idolize high-alcohol hop monsters. Not that this is meant to be a monster in itself, that task can be left to Stone's more specialized projects, like Vertical Epic and Ruination. Arrogant Bastard is just a wholesome little pale ale on crack and PCP. Innocent deep down, but wild and out of control on top.  Ok, enough abstraction. It has a strong maroon color, red bleeding into brown and black. Pours beautifully, with a nice thick tan head and subtle lacing. The scent is lush - it smells like a caramel rainforest. Taste is similar - thick, rich caramel lurks under a barrage of hyperactive hops, which dance across the tongue sparkling with crisp sweet floral flavors. Again, caramel rainforest pretty much sums it up. Mouthfeel is acrid and complex, which turns off a lot of people, though I personally love it.

Hilarious! Now that I've gotten that out of the way, the review!  A - Pours a color that looks like cherry-wood. Very pretty, and with a 1-finger head the shade of light tan? Please... From the others I've had by Stone, I can say that they make very pretty beers, and this is no different. Great clarity, carbonation, and with good lacing too! Excellent all around.  S - Spruce and hoppiness. Very powerful, really. Apple-like quality to the hops as well, along side with a very slight hint at maltiness. Really quite pleasant.  T - Very aggressive, as I'd expect. Hops to the max all around. There's a sort acidic sourness to it, and that makes a really rough one to drink (though not bad!). Very bitter on the back end. Good overall.  M - Light-bodied and with sparkling carbonation. Feels good on the tongue, and finishes just a smidgen dry. Not surprising considering the hop quality.  D - On one hand, it isn't powerfully alcoholic nor is it too expensive. It is very bitter, though, and it is a rough drinking beer. I'll come back to it, but probably not in the same night.  Overall/notes - Another really good beer from a really good brewery. I actually had this once long ago, before I had any IPAs that I enjoyed, and was put off by it.

Some dark fruit like prunes and brown sugar.  TASTE: Just like the aroma - an intense blending of bright hops and rich, sweet caramel. They dance back and forth together in a complex, bitter, and entertaining way.

The nose comprises a good amount of citrus, grapefruity, and piney hops backed by a strong backbone of solid caramel. The taste holds similar characteristics, though all elements are taken to a higher level: hops are large, the maltiness is large...maybe I'm not worthy after all, as I'm not sure how else to describe this flavor combination.

It is however, a nice beer to split amongst friends whilst BS ing.  The arrogant bastard is just what you would expect from Stone.

T: To me, this tastes very similar to Yakima Twilight, so let me reiterate what I said there: The hops kiss your tongue all the way on this one. The initial taste is a bracing hop bitterness, with the hop overtones kicking in in the middle. The finish is rather bitter, which renders it rather different from, say, a 90-minute IPA. Personally, I'd like a bit more malt backbone, but I'm not complaining.  M: Medium to full body with lots of happy bubbles.

Smell - Fresh citrus hops dominate the nose. Smells really juicy. Big and inviting.  Taste - Bitter grapefruit up front with a nice roasted flavor adding some depth part way through. Finishes with a strong bitterness, which may be perceived as slightly harsh by some. Absolutely not balanced, but that's exactly what Stone was shooting for. The bitterness is bold and assertive in this brew and it is definitely the defining feature. I wish there was more citrus depth to the bitterness as the nose led me to believe. I should say that the malt does hold its own against the onslaught of hops and plays enough of a balancing role to make this another delicious beer from Stone.  Mouthfeel - Medium-full body. Smooth.  Drinkability - For those that aren't into hop bombs, beware. This is right up my alley, although I'd never want to follow this up with anything as it has a pretty aggressive taste.

Waiting for the retentive head to die down so I can start drinking it is an excercise in patience, but at least I have all this pretty lace it leaves behind to look at. Has a coarse, piney, citric sort of hop aroma with a hint of raisiny esters underneath. Loads of grapefruit and pine flavour goes toe to toe with toasty, slightly nutty malt and dried fruit esters, with the hops winning the battle. The knockout punch is a blast of coarse, leafy bitterness in the finish. This is a palate destroyer for me, and I like it. Alcohol is just barely noticeable and doesn't contribute any heat or warmth.  It's full body and fine carbonation provide a rich and smooth mouthful. In every way, this full flavoured ale tastes as big as it promises to on the back of the bottle. When I first tried it almost two years ago it was overpowering to me, and today I can say I love it.

After slowly rising and a subsequent pour to push out the remaining head, the beer is served with two fingers of an airy and creamy light cream head. The retention is excellent and the sea foam style lace is immaculate so far. The body is a murky tawny color and completely impenetrable by light. Brown with orange tints.  S: The nose is incredible. The citra dry hopping completely transforms the Arrogant Bastard into a much hoppier brew. By far the most citrus oriented hop bill I've ever had in an American Strong Ale.  T: Literally bursting with citrus and tropical aromas and flavors. Mango, overly ripe peach, clementine, bitter orange pith and white grapefruit. Hops are heavy, bready malts are medium in intensity. The yeast flavors are big too, doughy and earthy with a touch of must.  M: The mouthfeel is slightly lacking which may or may not have something to do with the massive amount of head that is commonplace for the first pour from a keg. Seemingly soft carbonation (almost cask-like) and very smooth on the tongue. Medium-heavy bitterness throughout with a fairly dry finish. Slightly thin body. If the body and carbonation were beefed up, the mouthfeel would score well. Instead, the rating drops to a 2.5.  D: Very good. This is a vast improvement on a pretty good beer to begin with.

You really can get a different sip each time you go back to the glass, and different flavors cold or warm, and different flavors with pairings. There's mostly some hops, with caramel and citrus. Quite a bit of bitter, ending with a touch of astringent. You really understand why this beer is called ""arrogant bastard"" here- there's a lot to take in, and it leaves quite a lingering impression on the palate.  m- Good body and carbonation, feels a bit creamy overall. Good for lingering and tasting.  d- You really want to savor the complex flavors while you're drinking it, but the overall bitter and aftertaste has you putting it down for a bit to collect yourself. A great beer to start or end a night, but you'd have to be the beer's namesake to drink this all through the night.  verdict- A great tasting beer, and certainly an experience you want to have once (and maybe again), but I don't really see this as more than an occasional drink.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Duvel is, I think, the only other beer so conspicuously absent from my ranks, and it's a safe bet that that one will also be rectified soon enough.  Anyway, on to the beer: pours a deep ruby brown, beautiful color, with a one-finger tan head that literally lasts forever. Just phenomenal retention from this one. Solid walls of lacing.  Nose is nice and full. Nice, robust citrusy hop note well with a toasty malt body carrying just a bit of cocoa, and a a nip of caramel. Light alcohol comes through as well.  Taste is almost perfectly balanced - starts off with toasty malt, just a bit of caramel, sitting just underneath a soft, grapefruit rind-like hop bitterness that lasts from beginning to the very end. Burst of fruity esters towards the back of the palate. Finish is dry, with a firm, lightly astringent bitterness that carries through with a lingering toasted caramel presence as well.  Mouthfeel is dry, a bit creamy, medium-full bodied with a very nice, almost fluffy carbonation.  Bitterness got to me a bit - drinkability takes a bit of a hit as a result.

I was instantly drew to the name, artwork, the speech on the back, that it used only natural ingredients, and admittedly, the alcohol content. I drank my bomber out of a paper bag while watching the fireworks with some friends. I was intrigued enough to start buying more of these ""cool"" beers, looked them up on Google, found BeerAdvocate, and the rest was history. Onto the review -  Bomber to a pint glass. Pours very dark red with a huge fluffy beige head. Shrinks down to 1-finger and stays there the entire beer, excellent retention. Leaves decent lacing. The smell lets out some nice citrus and dark fruit, and some bread scents. The taste is great - hops are assaulting at first but seem to hold back after the first few sips and let the flavors shine. Pine, caramel sweetness, candied bread, grapefruit and plum are tastes I pick up. There is some alcohol bite that shows up now and then. The mouthfeel is good, but feels a little watery and unbalanced after having Double Bastard not too long ago. Still there is a nice creaminess. A bomber is plenty for this beer, lots of palate assaulting going on. I love this beer, I will continue to get every once in a while.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,generallee,4.48,"Presentation: It was poured from brown 1pt. 6oz bottle into a pint glass. The bottle has the abv at 7.2%, there is no freshness date and there is an amusing description arrogance, there beer and there brewery.  Appearance: The beer has a beautiful dark ruby red hue with good clarity and a creamy light tan head. The thick creamy head has good retention and slowly fades to a thin cap of frothy foam. From this head I get lots of cool lacing and lace rings on the glass.  Smell: It has a big juicy citrusy hop presence over nice bready maltiness in the background.  Taste/Palate: There is a good solid mix of bready, caramely, grainy malt with loads of juicy of citrusy, grapefruity, lemony, and piney hop notes. The hops bring solid bitterness which slowly fades off the tongue deep into the finish. The palate has a firm yet still easy drinking texture with active carbonation and a good solid medium to full body.  Notes: This is one very tasty, well crafted flagship beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ktrillionaire,3.17,"A - Reddish mahogany hue, off-white head, huge blanketing lacing.  S - There is an unwelcome aroma in the nose, I didn't write it down when I could specifically identify it, so as of now it is just a generally unwelcome aroma taking down the overall dynamic.  T - The taste is simply malt and hop, and quite unspectacular. The hop is nice on the outro, and that about sums up the highlights of the taste for me.  M - Big feel, viscous, well-carbonated.  D - Like a average Sierra Nevada product. Yes, a average. I didn't learn me not no nothing in school. That didn't stop me from preparing for the BA misspelling bee, with my eyes on the prize.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Ragedman,3.7,Reading all the reviews of Arrogant Bastard I was expecting this wonderful beer full of flavor and easy drinkability. Arrogant Bastard is full of flavor. Grapefruit and hops are the most powerful. At first the taste is smooth and once finished a bitter taste lingeres in the back of your mouth. From the outside Arrogant Bastards looks and smells amazing. Dark orange/brown color and I found it to smell very sweet with some hoppy overtones. What set me back was the drinkabilty toward the end of the 22oz bottle. It started to taste like dandilion flowers and had warmed up a bit much. Needless to say for anyone looking for a strong ale with alot of flavor Arrogant Bastard hits the mark.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,emmasdad,4.1,"I've been drinking this one since the late nineties, back when Stone was a tiny production brewery in San Marcos. Figure it's time to finally review it. Pours a moderately hazy chocolate brown color, with ruby highlights and a big mocha head. Aromas of milk chocolate, piney hops and just a hint of citrus. On the palate, I get a lot more piney/citrusy hops, along with caramel and cocoa. This has been a really good beer for a really long time. Very nice.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,Mancer,4.13,"This beer poured a honey amber with a 1 finger high off white head. There's some nice head retention with thick lacing all around the glass. Slowly drifted down to a thin layer, still fully covering the beer. The bubbles appear to be quite lively and resulted with a medium carbonation feel. The initial smell of the beer was that of dark fruits, pine, malts, and citrus hops. The initial taste of the beer was that of pine, malts, slight citrus (possibly grapefruit), and hops. The alcohol does not seem to be apparent . The brew finished bitter and dry, with a slight wheaty and dark fruit flavor. The after taste was a rather pleasant hoppiness that I have come to love thanks to IPA styles. The beer has a medium to full body.  The first time I had this beer (several months ago) I was definitely not prepared for it. What I have to say is that I actually really like it this time around, especially that bitter and dry bite it has. I think Stone has some of the best priced bombers and the quality of the brews is always excellent and refreshing. However, given that it does have the bitter and dry bite, it receives a lower drinkability factor because it requires more time for savoring and sipping.

I have learned to love hoppy beer, so I wanted to give it a shot and see what I would think now that I know what to look for.  Appearance - this beer is a deep reddish color. Very dark, almost mahogany. Some dark orange notes.  Smell - Honestly, everything. I can smell bready malts, I think. And citrusy hops.  Taste - Just strong and great. Hops upfront, the alcohol and bitterness appears in the back.  Mouthfeel - Heavy and syrupy in the mouth. Great texture.  Drinkability - It's ruinous, but at the same time very drinkable.

147,92,MasterSki,4.2,"Picked this up at Lakeview Binny's for $3.99(!). Enjoy by March 15th, 2010, so this is about a month old. Served in my Stone Arrogant Bastard pint glass.  A - Pours a lovely transparent dark caramel-orange color. There's a huge three fingers of tan foam that dissipates to a thick cap and leaves intricate patterns of lacework.  S - Aggressive piny and floral hops, notes of orange, with perhaps a touch of soapiness. There's a hefty malt backbone full of toffee, spicy fresh-baked bread, and brown sugar.  T - Taste is chock full of piny bitterness that lingers well into the aftertaste. Mid-palate there is an eruption of orange milk chocolate, and brown sugar. A bit of spicy alcohol pops up as well at the back end, which is surprising for a 7.2% brew.  M - Smooth medium-full body that implies a much bigger beer. Lower end of the carbonation spectrum, with just enough zing to keep things from getting syrupy. Lots of bitterness in the finish and a lightly sticky residual feel.  D - I can down a bomber of this one, but the bitterness gets punishing and palate-destroying. This certainly is a bastard in that respect. An American classic - marrying the strong a German-influenced malt tradition with American bruising hoppiness.

147,92,Yoonisaykul,4.22,"My first taste of a Stone product. So much hype, Hope I won't be disappointed. But it is just beer, right?  1Pt. which I put in the freezer about 15 minutes so it's not very chilled.  A- Dark ruby-brown. Nice thick chewy looking head is a very light brown/beige. It,s been 5 minutes without a sip and it's now only a thin layer but left some bunched up lacing.  S- Floral hops, some grapefruit. Soft alcohol. Malty and sweet candy/red licorice and dark fruit. Some light woodiness. I'm not blown away yet. Not an impressive smell but a great one. I'd be smelling my pint all night if I had this in a bar.  T- I was bracing myself... So not as shocking as I thought. Some of the most flavorful and floral bittering hops I've had the chance to taste in a beer. The very first sip allowed for a very tasty soapy hop burp. Some sourness. Considerably woody. Very bitter. Alcohol appears through aeration. Would be a just tasty as an IPA but is a delicious Ale. Few last sips now and this kind of tastes watery.  M- Close to full. Close to high carbonation. Feels good, nice and smooth. A bit sticky though. I'm done now and my teeth are numb.  D- Very good. Quite light yet complex.  This is a very good beer but I think all the arrogance on the bottle was better suited for the scene some years ago when extreme beers were fewer. High quality. I can't say I would try very hard to score some more but finding it on tap and having it with some food would be great.

147,92,drtth,4.08,"Poured into a Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. The bottle has a ""best by"" date of May 11th so this is a bit on the mature side for a beer that relies a lot on its hops.  Appearance: As the beer is poured it is a clear deep mahogany color with a light tan 1 ½"" head that is filled with lots of large and small foamy bubbles. The head recedes slowly leaving a spider web of lacing clinging to the glass. Sipping leaves behind scattered patches of lacing that cling as well.  Smell: There was a burst of hop aroma upon opening the bottle, but from the glass as the beer warms there is dark rich caramel and dark brown sugar from the roasted malts, combined with some grapefruit zest and some almost burnt character hiding way in the background. The aroma is definite and reasonably complex as it changes over time.  Taste: While at first the dominant flavor in a sip is that of a slightly sweet fruity maltiness, there is a sudden, aggressive wave of bitter grapefruit that takes over in the back of the mouth. However that wave of bitterness appears without the tongue rasp and rip that some hoppy beers display. There are also some roasted malt flavors that suggest some very dark roast may have been used in the grain bill to maintain the bitterness even after hop fade sets in.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium to full bodied with a smooth, creamy feel from the persistent fine carbonation. The finish is moderately long and predominantly bitter grapefruit that fades away as the dryness lingers on and on.  Drinkability: As noted above the beer has a bit more bottle age than I'd like for reviewing something with this much reliance on hop flavors. However, I did enjoy it and found one sip followed another easily. Although this will not go on my list of beers to have regularly, I'll probably be having this one again and I'll be trying it much fresher next time and will modify this review if needed.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Pours a clear amber-brown color with a pretty full tannish head. There is quite a bit of rising bubble activity notable through the glass. Pretty nice lacing as well.  Smell is dominated by malt, hops and caramel. There are nice hints of citrus and other fruits here. This is a very full and somewhat complex aroma.  Taste is full and malty up front. Presence of caramel and a bit of biscuit is comleted by the nice bite of hoppiness. Pretty bold and aggressive. A bit of a burn from alcohol is also noted.  Mouthfeel is very full with medium carbonation. Quite a presence with a bit of bite.  This is a very nice beer overall. In earlier days, it stood out as unique and bold.

I mainly wanted to highlight the taste, which really does an excellent job of blending the malt bill used with the Chinook hops. Being a homebrewer, I appreciate the structure that the brewers used to incorporate the unique quality that Chinook can bring, while avoiding some of the drawbacks that it can have when used in overabundance.  Aside from the hops, the beer is fairly easy drinking and I did not notice any alcohol warming from this beer, as I can usually spot with high ABV brews. I tend to shy away from high ABV beers during the summer, but this will be something that I will definitely have on hand during the cooler months of the year.

Nice Chinook hop, pine scent along with a strong amount of caramel with figs. Nice aroma.  Malt focus at the start of the tasting. Rich mouthfeel with some nice sweetness and dark fruit character. This is followed by a strong punch of hop bitterness. Not as much hop flavor as I might have expected -- the hops are more bitterness oriented than flavor oriented. Definitely some alcohol presence at the end with the bitterness.  Nice beer, easy to drink for a strong red ale.

Had it on tap at University Pizzeria and Italian Eatery on the campus of YSU (this place is the single greatest reward to my recent return to school). In a pint glass.  A: Pours a darkish red with about a two-finger head that fades rather quickly (bottled version usually doesn't fade so fast).  S: Well balanced between the hops and the malts. Better than solid smell, but doesn't fully prepare one for the taste assault to follow.  T: According to Stone, ""This is an aggressive beer."" Yeah, that's a pretty good way do describe the taste. Hops are very present but not dominating, well balanced. (Of course, by balanced I mean both levels are equally overpowering, in a very good way.)  M: As close to perfect as I've ever had, especially given the strength of the taste.  D: Have to deduct half a point here for the 7.2%. On a Friday evening I might have a third.

I'm not awful in to big hop beers, which this sort of epitomizes, but then again I'm sure that there are plenty of malty types that might be interested in this beer- so there is my preface.  This my second experience with this beer, the first of which was on tap at a local pub. Pours a ruddy amber with ~2.5 fingers of off white head. The nose speaks to the heavy hop experience that is on its way. Flavor follows nose, though as the beer sits out a bit and warms the malt makes itself known, in a little way.

Bitter aftertaste lingers, pleasant at first, but fading with time.  M: Average. I don't really have much to say. Hops have a mild drying taste.  D: Starts strong, but doesn't quite hold out.

147,92,diabecktic,4.68,"Appearance: This translucent, dark cherry-red brew yields ~3 fingers of frothy, light-tan head. Bubbles slowly rise, lending an airy weight to the aforementioned head. Retention (~1 fingers linger) and lacing are both excellent throughout the entire tasting.  Smell: The nose is extremely complex. I find that notes of grapefruit, pine-like hops are dominant to a toasted caramel malt. I can't quite discern which spices complement the product, but they are somewhat sweet and earthy (nutmeg and/or allspice?).  Taste: Much like the nose, the flavor is - as the bottle proclaims - aggressive and excellent. The bitterness seems to come before the malt character, but the balance is nearly perfect; flavors are as described in the smell portion of the review. As the beer warms, I find that the flavors become more well-defined as a subtle buttery taste makes itself known.  Mouthfeel: Given the variety and intensity of flavors, I'm suprised that this beer isn't too lively when sitting in the mouth. The beer is ever-so-slightly oily, but the medium body and restrained carbonation keep things from getting out of control.  Drinkability: The alcohol content is restrained fairly well for being ~7.2%. This beer is definately one to sip on for two reasons: the alcohol will creep up on you, and the complexity of the flavors are incredibly. You're missing out if you don't sip on this one.  Summary: This brew is simply outstanding. Though clearly a clever marketing gimmick, the folks at Stone Brewing Company have every right to be arrogant about this product. The diversity of flavors and aromas might not be for everyone, but if you appreciate extremely well-made craft beers, you will find this beer exceptionally enjoyable. I was thoroughly impressed and I will try more beers from this brewery in the future.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

It reminds me a little of a scotch ale!  Taste seems to follow nose pretty well. Certainly some sweet caramel malt, then a pine and earthy hop note. Some big bitterness is hiding here though!! I do also get some dark fruit notes. Finishes dry and a little earthy.  Good carbonation. Nice mouthfeel. Not chewy. Not watery. Not bad at all.  This is a pretty decent brew by the stone boys... I can't wait to try the oaked version.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ThreeDimesDown,3.36,"A dark cherry, clear pour with a nice beige head that dissipates to a lingering remnant providing nice lacing till the end.  Aromas of hops, citrus and pine are most powerful with hints of caramel.  The taste is bigger than the nose with hops (citrus and piney) up front but not overbearing. Caramel maltiness mellows the hops a bit. Bittering hops are strong leaving a dry, sticky finish.  For a higher ABV, the mouthfeel is smooth with the constant small bubble carbonation. Light to medium with an almost creamy feel.  Drinking this one that is two weeks from ""best by"" date, so the hops are in the forefront. It's a good drink and can imagine it pairing nicely with a big flavor meal. But not necessarily a brew I'd have a session with.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,bamadog,4.13,"Here's a beer that I've had multiple times in the bottle and have typically always enjoyed it, and this is the first time I've ever had it on tap and this a great example of a time when the tap KILLS the bottle! Reviewed on 4/2/2010 and poured from the tap to a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a deep woody amber/coppery color and starts with a one finger off-white head with great retention that eventually fades to a thick and uneven skim; body is dark and hard to see through, but it's clarity is still quite solid and it shows strong carbonation; big thick curtains of puffy lacing hold strong to the sides of the glass.  Smell: Not especially strong, but there are definite scents of just flat-out bitter hops bubbling up and into the nose. Piney and a bit of a citric characteristic. I wish the nose was a bit more potent, but as Frank the Tank said, it's all good when it hits your lips!  Taste: Hops abound and they are bitter and piney with some strong hints of grapefruit flavors as well -- really dominant; surprisingly, there is a fair caramel malty backing for just a bit of balance, but it really allows the hoppy profiles to dominate; alcohol is masked to near perfection with just a slight hint.  Mouthfeel: Tons of hop resins leave the mouth very sticky; the stickiness is very dry and cottony; a bit of warmth is left in the belly; carbonation is very present, but the body is still very smooth as the body of is rather significant weight; quite nice and nearly perfect.  Drinkability: It's a little big, but everything is going right with this beer on tap! Great on a nice warm night as the bitterness is refreshing and it's a tad filling, but it's not going to slow me down. I could drink this all night.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

S - Nice hoppy aroma with a nice malt backbone. Very well-balanced.  T - A nice meld of hops and malts balanced perfectly. There's a bitter finish that makes you want to come back for more.

147,92,Eisen,4.68,"I have had this beer sitting around my apartment for awile and decided it was time to finaly open it up. I picked up a bomer at Pike Street Beer and Wine in seattle for $4.69. I may not be worthy but I definatally was impressed. The appearance is a nice red/amper toped of with a gostly white, fluffy head, of which leaves a thick and scatered lacing. The smell is alchool and a tuch of hops; I will admit my sense of smell s not very good. The taste of the beer itself is wonderfully balanced palate of alchool fussle oils. I searved it at room temp. and that may be why I get mostly alchool, but that is not bad. This is a strong ale. Even if I cannot taste the hops or grain, they are there working together to balance the beer as a 12 year casking would for wiskey; I suppose that is why the barrel aged version is acclaimed strongly. The mouthfeel is slytle sticky but not unplesant at all. I am not a fan of strong ales but I could drink this from sun rise to sun set.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,generalnotsew,4.18,A: Nice fat even head that decides to stay around til the first sip. There is a very deep mahogany color. Quite nice to look at.  S: Very sweet caramel maltiness. Have to say the best by date was 3 months ago so I detect none of the hops. Quite frankly I think I prefer AB without the hops. Maybe a touch of fruit.  T: Sweet sweet malts. A touch of maple. The hops are still present but very weak and only come through in the aftertaste. Also get a touch of coffee here.  M: Very creamy and rich. Not aggressive but very mellow.  D: Easy to drink while fresh or a bit of age.  I have had this so many times. I was drinking it before I even started pouring my beer and loved it every time.

147,92,dedrinker,3.87,"Yup, this one's a really arrogant bastard alright, to get such an overall high score.  Chestnut color - is it on fire with ironic back label marketing strategies?  Aroma of floral and piney hops.  With the hops carrying over on the taste, add a sweet malt backbone. The finish is a little more bitter than is usual for these days, attesting to the early days of A.B. extremity in brewing - before all the hops were up front on the nose and pallet with only sufficient bittering hops to balance the malt.  I drank it on the go to wash down a hastily eaten turkey wrap. I'm busy and self-important.

147,92,ToasterChef,4.7,"Reviewed from my notes. Served on-tap in a PBR pint glass (a nice touch). The beer has a translucent brown hue and a small, bubbly tan head. There are tiny bubbles rising within the glass. As I drink, it leaves behind some great lacing. The aroma is equally impressive. There are a lot of musty, grain-like fresh hops. Yum. The AB has an intense hop flavor on top of a good, slightly sweet malt base. It's an all-around excellent flavor. It has a medium body and an excellent level of carbonation. The chill of the serving temperature and the carbonation bubbles are very playful; almost too much so, but not quite. Generally, I like the AB just a bit warmer, but this still feels great. This is so drinkable, considering what a strong, offensive beer this is. I could drink it all day.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Jeffo,4.02,"Got this at the Cracked Kettle  From a bomber into a snifter  APPEARANCE: Pours a three finger thicker looking beige head with great retention. Deep auburn brown with next to zero carbonation and perfectly clear. Head slowly fades to a decent foam cap leaving some immediate lacing. Splotchy film remains until the end, leaving some splotches of lace down the glass.  SMELL: Pale and toasted malts with some nice caramel and toffee notes. Touches of bread and some pine and floral hops as well. Quite a balanced and bold nose.  TASTE: Pale malts up front and some caramel as well. This is soon brushed aside by a wave of piney and floral hops and hop bitterness. A very strong and bold long lasting aftertaste is plenty bitter with lots of pine notes. A very bitter and lingering finish, which was a bit of a surprise given the nose. Still, tasty stuff.  PALATE: Medium body and slightly light on the palate. Higher end carbonation. Semi-creamy on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly dry.  OVERALL: Definitely a bold and aggressive beer, just like the label says. I enjoyed this one, but one bomber is enough for sure. The bitter aftertaste was impressive for sure, but perhaps a little out of place given the big malt profile up front. Regardless this is a tasty and enjoyable beer, and one that I'll definitely revisit, but not something I'll go out of my way to aquire.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,tubacharlie,4.47,"Flowery hop aroma. Poured aggressively it produces a big, beige colored, four-finger head with staying power. Large bubbles migrate to the side of the glass while the middle develops a silky smoothness in a boulder-like formation.  The brew is a strong reddish-brown amber color with a touch of haziness that increases when the last of the bottle is added after swirling around to catch the yeast in the bottom.  Big fresh hop flavor up front, in the middle and the back palate with a strong malt component to balance. Notes of caramel, brown sugar and roasted barley. Lingering hop and yeast flavor with bitterness across the palate.  Excellent brew that would pair well with roast beef and horseradish (wish I had some right now to be sure!).  Curious note: enjoy by 3-2-10 is printed very lightly near the bottom of the bottle - I almost missed it and had to look very hard. But of course, a beer of this gravity will age well for years, so I wonder why they are dating them so young? (A good topic for the Beer Forum).

147,92,billshmeinke,4.46,"Bomber into a large mug. This is the beer that started it for me, so I'm surprised I haven't taken the time to review it until now.  Fairly aggressive pour yields a monstrous 3 finger light tan head, one finger of which is actually above the rim of the glass. Amber/brown in color (reminiscent of the color of the brown glass of the bomber it was just poured from) with brighter amber hues towards the edge of the glass. The head retention is quite nice as a significant layer of foam hangs around all the way through, and coats the sides of the glass with lacing.  Smell is dominated by a citrus/pine hop aroma. There is a pleasant bready yeast in there too as well as a faint caramel malt.  The flavor packs a punch. Intensely bitter and hoppy. The hop flavor manifests as bitter pine, resin, dank, and a hint of citrus (lemon/orange rind/grapefruit). Also in there is a biscuit like yeast flavor and light sweet malt that comes through as caramel/toffee. There's also a light fruit flavor in there as well that I can only describe as strawberries. The bitterness of the hops linger in a very satisfying way. Truly a complex and aggressive beer.  The body of this is on the fuller side of medium. Tiny bubbles, medium carbonation. Glides over the tongue. Quite smooth.  A beer I can easily drink all night. This is one of those beers that I keep coming back to. No matter how much I explore new and strange craft beers, I can always crack open an Arrogant Bastard and know that I will be satisfied.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I could drink this all the time and never get tired of it. Dark reddish-brown, good flavor, strong, subtly tart, and rich for a beer of this type. Complex as well, smooth and easy drinking yet complex and feels thick at the same time. I love that it has a hoppy quality but is also very malty. Tastes like an IPA/red ale combo that is perfectly mixed. The bitter flavor tops it all off.  Love it. I don't know if I'll ever have a better beer.

S - Very malty with hop essence.  T - VERY BITTER. Left a very bitter hop taste in my mouth for some time after each sip. Almost like pure grapefruit extract. The malt taste is present but the bitterness takes a front seat.  M - Left a creamy feeling in my mouth with good carbonation.  D - I can recommend this being good with a heavy meal.

Great retention here as it lingers for quite some time and leaves a thin broken lacing all over the glass.  S-the nose isn't very big but it is balanced. Caramel malts and bread give a light lead in but must take a back seat to a strong hop profile. Pine resign leads into a citric hop of tangerine.  T-this is extremely bitter. The malt base is strong and present but the bitter hops are the centerpiece. Sweet caramel and burnt brown sugar meld together with big resigny pine. Citric hops and herbal notes are light in the back, tangerine, and the hop bitterness is all that stands at finish.  M-medium bodied, smooth, and a thin syrupy feel. The carbonation holds throughout the drink and finishes crisp. This is actually a little dry on the palate as well.  D-very tasty brew, a classic.

147,92,happilysurly,3.71,"A: Pours a deep reddish brown. Minimal head with tight bubbles. I noticed it was pretty thick as I poured and it has some legs to it, taking a bit to settle back down.  S: Its beer like this that are flavorful but not overly aromatic that make me wish I had a better sense of smell. I'll give it a 3.5 because I imagine that a more distinguishing nose would pick up on more than the ""fresh"" smell I get. Though I will say this: as I get about half way through the glass of beer I feel like I get a better sense of the aroma and can definitely pick up on sweet, malty and burnt caramel smells.  T: Very malty upfront with a bitter finish. Not subtle, but also not over the top. Very little alcohol taste, though, it is only 7.2% ABV so that is to be expected.  M: Beers like this are a bit more difficult for me to enjoy after the first half. The combination of rich malt and bitter finish leave a taste in the back of my mouth that will not go away unless I have some really salty snack foods.  D: Again, I wouldn't want to drink a lot of this in one sitting.

Sweet, with maybe a hint of caramel.  T - I'm not very good at picking out individual flavors. Starts sweet and then the hops come through for a bitter finish.

Taste is fairly overwhelming. My taste buds have been laid siege to by the aforementioned hop attack, plus a smokehouse maple taste. In addition, a good malty backbone supports the front lines well. Maybe a tang of citrus before the hoppy aftertaste comes back to kick me in the face again.  Mouthfeel felt a little light to me, maybe I wasn't paying attention enough.  While I liked this a lot, I don't think the overall drinkability is very high. The 7.2% is fairly strong, plus the sensory assault is a little too much.

It pours a nice burnt sienna with a thick umber foam. The bitterness takes a harsh bite out of your palate immediately and keeps biting. In fact, as you continue the bitterness continues on for 3 or 4 swallows after you stop. Surprisingly, as you become accustomed to it you can begin to appreciate the roasted malts and even a little sweetness from the alcohol as it warms. Moderately high carbonation keeps everything in check.

147,92,Daniellobo,3.68,"Nice draft pour, but while it feels a bit more assertive on the hop profile than bottled versions it is close to compromising a bit the richness and balanced experienced there.  Presentation: 16 oz draft offering. Menu offers a fair one liner description and brewery location. Served in a pilsner-like glass.  A - Deep amber color with a fine off-white foamy head. Fine retention and showy lacing as it goes down to an assertive surface lid.  S - Smell is not particularly assertive, It has a faint not of sweet caramel malt notes with a citrus hoppy hint.  T - Taste remains far more assertive and rich than the smell. There is still a good sense of malt and somewhat fruity flavor finished, but the rich citrus hoppy bite takes a far more prominent role than what it does on the bottle.  M - Fine carbonation on a medium to full bodied beer. Creamy and smooth feel.  D - Still drinkable on tap but feels like a different beast, not far from other versions but while good maybe a bit less memorable.  Notes: Remains a nice offering on tap, but feels a bit subdued...

To be honest, as milestones go, this is hardly one of the absolute pinnacle hallmarks of my life. So I thought, what better way to not celebrate this non-achievement than over an Arrogant Bastard Ale. If nothing else I think this'll bump my beer styles stats up to 74. So there's that.  Pours a ruby hued brown topped by a mousey, foamy, ample, indefatigable beige head that leaves behind loads of sticky lacing. This is one damned handsome beer.  The aroma is a creamy caramel malt casually walking down the street before turning a hard corner and bumping headlong into a leafy, grassy, pithy hop that knocks it on its ass while sweet perfume notes point and laugh. It just really draws you in and makes you want to drink it.  This brutal bastard of a beer is one bitter beast, but they've got the bitter to malt ratio spot-on here. Predominantly a leafy, cedar bitterness runs the show, with caramel playing a strong supporting role, the Garfunkel to hops' Simon, really, playing an in some ways even more important but much less understood or appreciated role in the harmony between the two. Orange peel comes out as things warm, as do some toasted notes and roastiness, with suggestions of black coffee. Great depth of flavor as each sip commands your full attention and draws you in.  It's full bodied and viscous, absolutely teeming with hop oils, but with a good amount of carbonation to keep things tasting clean and fresh.  Overall it's hard to imagine anyone who is a fan of big, hoppy American beers not appreciating this beer. I know I do.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,flagmantho,4.3,"Poured from 22oz bomber into a tulip.  Appearance: rich amber-brown with two fingers of medium tan compact foam head. I'm thinkin' it's looking pretty good.  Smell: rich aroma of slightly toasty, slightly caramelly malt with a nice dose of quite funky hops. This is not one of Stone's wood-aged varieties of AB, but it does have what I would call a slightly woody aroma to it. I guess that's just a bonus.  Taste: a thick, unforgiving, uncompromising malt flavor paired with funky, herby and bitter hops. It's certainly not subtle, but it's also not terribly refined. My mind's eye pictures an unfinished, un-sanded 2x4. Maybe that's just because this beer reminds me a lot of pine resin. In any case, it's quite tasty, if rough around the edges.  Mouthfeel: medium body with a nice carbonation. The mouthfeel is seriously smooth, in great contrast to the suckerpunch flavor. I like it.  Drinkability: Arrogant Bastard is not for beginners. I recall having a trying time of it not too long ago. Still, despite its rancor for humanity, it maintains as an extremely enjoyable beer.

147,92,kalkavekkian,4.25,"Poured out of a 22 into a weizen glass. Color was a deep, copper- amber with a thick creamy tan head that stuck around for awhile. Thick sticky lacing all down the glass even after empty. Medium to strong hop smell and a nice sharp, bitter bite that doesn't fade too quickly. Loved the aftertaste and slight burn in the throat. Very strong hop flavor with some malty aftertones. Mouthfeel was creamy and rich with good carbonation that went down smoothly. Drinkability was very good for me with only a light buzz after about a leisurely 45 minute session with a double deuce. I would recommend this to any hop lover who likes a big taste! The only gripe i have about this as well as the other stones offerings is it is very hard to make out the exp. dates. They need to change the color of the ink, especially for those of us east of the big muddy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,TheOtherMike,4.9,"As Stone is now one of now my default beer choices, I decided to try another one of their offerings. I found a 220z. bottle of this sitting on a shelf at a shop I had never been to before.  Wow! Even though this is a strong beer by my standards, it is very enjoyable and drinkable.  The color is a beautiful deep ruby red. It has plenty of head and the carbonation won't quit. It leaves a nice lace on the glass.  The taste is strong but very good. I was worried that it would be too much to remain pleasant before I could polish-of the bottle, but to my surprise it was quite good to the end - maybe it even got better!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BlackBearForge,4.23,"Arrogant Bastard, pours a deep ruby brown with a huge rocky tan head with loads and loads of sticky lacing all across the glass as it falls.  The aroma has a big strong caramel malt presence backed up by an equally huge floral and citrusy hop scent.  The flavor has the same huge malt backbone from the scent, big biscuity flavors with somewhat buttery caramel and toffee tones and a touch of salt and cocoa. Big hop flavors of pine resin only somewhat citrusy as well. Alcohol is extremely well hidden but noted mostly as a bit of burn on the tongue in the finish which is long and bitter but buffered by the sweetness from the malts.  Mouthfeel is full and ceamy, and very smooth. Carbonation is fairly robust.  Arrogant Bastard. was I worthy? I can't say, my wife doesn't doesn't like you and my son thinks you are pure evil in bottled form, but I could certainly warm up to you. I will say I still have half a bomber to enjoy all to myself!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,MrHassellYaHurd,4.48,"Pours into a pint glass a beautiful clear dark copper, light orange brown color with an off-white bubbly head.  Smells of strongly citrusy floral hops and a toasted malt note with dark aged fruits.  Very rich with sweet maltyness and roasted barley tastes in harmony with an aggressive hop bitterness. The alcoholic bite is faintly detectable, but the beer is very well-balanced and complex; everything fitting exactly in its place. It is medium/full-bodied and lightly carbonated. Very drinkable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,MbpBugeye,3.87,"I've had this many times, usually on tap in various bars around town. I am just now getting around to writing up a review.  A- Minimal head. The beer is a deep red color. There is a small amount of lacing at first.  S- Hoppy. However this beer wont be confused with an IPA. Its got a nice toasted malt base under all the bitter smelling hops.  T- As the smell suggests. Hoppy with lots of malts underneath. This is one biting beer. Alcohol is slightly noticeable.  M- Prickly carbonation but all in all a really smooth and fuller beer.  D- I cant sit and drink this stuff all night like some people can. One pint and thats about it for me. I do like this beer but I am not someone who loves it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,stevenseg,4.03,"I love Michigan. I can stop at any major party store and be greeted with a bevy of high-quality alcoholic concoctions of malted barley and hops. The four-hour drive to Grand Blanc from Columbus, Ohio is tiring in its own right, but my need for sleep was great enough to prompt me to stop by a BP gas station and pick up a 22oz bomber of Arrogant Bastard ale, the famed hoppy amber ale from Stone Brewing out of Escondido, California.  I poured the chilled bottle - about 45 degrees of chill - into a pint glass provided by my gracious host. This brew is hard to incorrectly pour, as long as I adhered to the 45%/50%/90% rule. AB poured a deep and rich rusty color with about 70% opacity. The head formed a nice off white layer on top, which never really dissipated, but rather formed very prominent lacing rings with every sip. That's the making of a more full-bodied ale than its thinner amber counterparts.  Stone Brewing is very consistent with the hops character of its beers, and Arrogant Bastard is no exception. The nose is citrusy with lightly-roasted malt sweetness. The alcohol content tries to bust through with a bit of aromatic pungency, but the 7.2% ABV is relatively well-hidden.  The lacing is beautiful...there is almost a solid coat around the entire glass. Of course, I am drinking at a higher temperature right now than Steve Wagner, Stone brewmaster, had intended (approximately 50 degrees). Higher temperatures = heavier body. It's beautiful regardless. The bittering hops make up the prominent character, lingering on the back of the palate between drinks. The fruit-like sweet lightly-roasted malts are more of an accent. Big malt flavor with bigger hops. The hops generate a grapefruit-like bitter character on the palate, but not so much in the nose.  I love fuller-bodied beers. The carbonation is very well done, and the viscosity renders this beer extremely smooth, perfectly adept to travelling down my throat. Try taking your time to let the beer warm up a bit. The characteristics that make this beer unique will emerge. Drink the first 11oz of a bomber at around 40-45 degrees and the last at 50-55 degrees. You'll notice the ""arrogance"" of this brew hit you right in the face.  With such a high alcohol content for an amber, Arrogant Bastard needs to be handled with caution. It's sweetness and hop balance will beg for you to spend a night with your nose in the air, but if you're not careful that same nose you thumbed at light lager drinkers all night long may end up facing the bottom of the toilet. One bomber at a time, young padawan, and ride the complexity of this brew to an appreciation of the best of beers. Cheers mate!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,zimm421,4.38,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a 12 oz snifter. Dark brown, with a little burnt orange hint to it. Comes with a nice thick off-white head that dissipates fairly slowly leaving some great lacing down the glass. Smell is full of roasted malts and some good citrus scents from the hops as well. The taste follows pretty well, starting out very sweet, and the aftertaste is very bitter, beating up my tounge for 15 to 30 seconds after each sip, absolutely love it. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy but still has a decent amount of carbonation. Not hard to drink at all, every sip makes me want to go back for more. I absolutely love this brew, I wasn't really looking for it, but when I saw it, I knew I had to go for it, and I'm so glad I did. Absolutely a great brew!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

A darker caramel color, with a larger head that lingers.  S: Hops, hops and more hops, and a bit of citrus.  T: Delicious. A nice grapefruit taste to start off, then a big hit of the hops, finishing with a bit more grapefruit and maybe a hint of pine.  M: A bit thick, but very enjoyable. Definitely not something to chug down at a frat party.  D: Because it's so big, I don't think I could drink more than a couple of these in a night, but boy does it go down smooth.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,boudreaux,4.15,"Had last summer during a weekend road trip to my buddy's beach house in Mexico Beach, FL.  It tasted great. The idea of naming a beer ""Arrogant Bastard"" pretty much defines the confidence of the brewery in this ale. You definitely taste alcohol, but more as an aftertaste. The first thing I noticed was the hoppiness.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,MikeGill,4.02,"Arrogant Bastard is not about the cool bottle or the hilarious disclosure, it's all about quality.  22oz. bottle poured into a nonic.  Dark red with creamy tight head. Huge aromatic hop nose with some toasted malt and grapefruit coming through.  Lots of fruit cake sweetness and dried herbs. Pine and citrus resine with a solid malt backbone. Carbonation is there but seems to just carry things along. If there was any less CO2 it might be syrupy. Spicy hops are relentless. Abundant grainy finish with plenty of alcohol warmth and mild traces of coffee grinds.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,keytones,4.9,"A: Very inviting dark color with a honey-colored head about an inch high that sustained throughout the drink.  S: Like walking into a brewery and being smacked in the face with a sack of hops.  T: Very strong flavor that lingers well after the sip. Malty with even a bit of citrus. My friends were convinced that I had squirted some lime into my mug  M: Thick, almost like molasses. Hearty and goes down smooth.  D: Very delicious but the higher alcohol content and strong, thick content of the beer keeps me from drinking more than a couple.  Overall I would suggest that you try this beer if you ever have a chance.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,morebeergood,3.41,"We went out to dinner with friends on a Friday night in the South End at the Stork Club. The only interesting beers on tap were Ipswich Ale and Arrogant Bastard, so I went with ABA as the first beer of the night. Looking back online, I know I've had this beer before, but I am now surprised that I have never reviewed it. Anyway, it was served in a pint glass. Very dark red color. Rich and creamy looking head. Not much smell was noticed. Taste is what you expect from a Stone beer: quality through and through. Nice mix of hops and malt, with a hint of sugar to brighten things up. The only thing that caught me off guard was the mouthfeel. While I liked it, it was much more creamier than I remembered. My wife also had a pint, and she swore it drank like a Guinness. Do they do ABA on nitro tap? Because that is what it tasted like. Didn't expect that, from Stone or this restaurant. Problem with the tap line perhaps? I don't know, but I need to try this again somewhere else to see if I am going crazy or maybe I just haven't had this beer in a while. I liked this beer, but it left me puzzled.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,popery,4.25,"What can I possibly add to other reviews of this beer? It's fantastic stuff, the kind of beer that converts normal folk into beer geeks. The combination of big citric hops and sweet caramel malt makes a mockery of style guidelines while still feeling utterly natural and refined. The flavor is balanced - big hops, big malt, big flavor. Arrogant Bastard has become a defining beer of the American craft movement and sits as the flagship of one of the best known and most loved craft breweries. All hail Greg Koch.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Floral hops and freshly cut grass aromas wafted from the glass. Massive hops dominated the flavor, with floral and grassy notes. The finish was bitter and lip-puckering dry. The hop aftertaste lingered. No balancing act here, this beer is all about the hops. I liked it though. I felt it offered something outside the norm.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

T- I was expecting a much stronger taste - but this is actually even better. All kinds of spice and fruit. The alcohol is a little noticeable, but manageable. Some roasted malts too.  M - Milky, but not to the point of heavy cream. Just right.  D - It sits a little heavy; especially being a bomber. But it's a carefully crafted brew.  Notes - This is the first strong ale I've had - and I have to say this makes a great first impression. I also appreciate the humor and smart-ass remarks that Stone puts on the bottle - claiming ""You're Not Worthy.""

Later as it warms some nutty smells and phenols are present. From the start it has a very complex taste. At first the boldness tease then beats the hell out of the palate until you submit. Sweet malt flickers upfront but then backs off to the powerful hops (which are part of the classified recipe). The hop flavors start as pine, and then grapefruit follows it up and kowtows to the massive bitter finish. It has a medium to full body, with good carbonation and it is actually quite pleasant once you get a hold of this beast.

Leaves with a charred sugar caramel sting.  Good carbonation for an ale of this type. Fluidity is good. Cuold be the state of my mouth but by the end of the bottle I had a pooling of Bastard essence on the back pf the palate.  Goes down easy. I'd like this with some sweet BBQ like dripping ribs.

147,92,boogyman,4.05,A- Poured into my Deschutes tulip glass. Color is a very very dark copper color with a off white head that is around two fingers. Lacing is fairly sticky. Cool bubbles floating on top.  S- Smell is fairly sweet with some tart dark fruit. You can definitely tell this is gonna be more malty then anything. Plums and cherries are strong on the nose.  T- Taste comes out strong on the malt but is balanced very nicely by the bitter hops. The nose comes on slightly which is nice on the palate. The sweet with the malt with the bitter hops makes this quite a tasty brew.  M- Feels fairly smooth and goes down easy. No alcohol burn to speak of.  D- I could easily have this frequently and this is not difficult given that this drink can be obtained in many places all year round. Definitely a beer I would go to if I had no dedicated beer store near by.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,BBThunderbolt,2.63,"This is a beer I used to drink regularly, then one day I found myself bored with it and haven't had one in at least two years. This style doesn't have a lot of clear definitions, and versions vary greatly. Let's see what's up.  Served in straight pint glass. Poured an attractive mahogany color with about a half inch of light tan head that quickly dissipated and left minimal lacing.  A mostly bitter hop aroma wafts through the olfactory area, with just a touch of malt in the background. The flavors are the mix of sweet and bitter, with that harsh metallic taste I remember still dominant.  The body is decent, solid and not heavy. Drinkability is not good, this beer is just not very enjoyable. This beer is very popular so my opinion is going to be the minority, but I won't be seeking this beer out again for a while.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Gave me a rich head of about 1/2 inch that took it sweet time disapating. Not quite as bitter as the Ruination so much more likely to be a session beer, however, when you have 22 oz servings at 7.2 ABV I guess one will do you just fine.

I'm fairly new to craft beer, so this was quite an experience on xmas day. The Bastard definitely has a bitter kick and it reminded me of what my tongue went through the first time I had a bitter SA Boston Ale. My taste buds really went wild searching for the different ingredients.I really noticed the caramel notes and the alcohol was covered quite well. It was a beer I grew to love as I sipped.

147,92,BedetheVenerable,3.88,"Presentation: Awesome, witty painted brown pop top bomber, no best-by date to be seen; this is one of the coolest packaging schemes I've ever seen, however  Appearance: Really attractive dark walnut beer with good clarity; a big, creamy light tan head crowns this beer, and shows good retention.  Smell: Definitely a hop-forward aroma, but the aromas are different than those I'm readily-familiar with. This is very fruity, a bit sharp and herbaceous as well, with a hint of alcohol and just a touch of dry toffee.  Taste: Nice blend of malt and hops...the hops are herbal, just a bit sharp, and show medium-high bitterness. This is juicy and a bit fruity as well. There is some surprisingly sweet, juicy caramel here as well as a ghost of toastiness on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-heavy  Drinkability: Pretty high  Conclusion: This is my first ever Stone beer; thanks so much to Tolann for hooking me up! This is not the earth-moving, life-changing experience I expected, but it was pretty tasty and interesting nonetheless. It was actually a fairly balanced ale between the malt and the hops; the hop flavors/aromas were unfamiliar to me (I was expecting citrus or pine aromas, or something earthy or woodsy, this didn't really show a lot of any of those aromas/flavors), however, and I would have liked a bit more in the way of malt presence from an ASA.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

T-Pine and hints of ctrus hoop bitterness are at the forefront with a barely there caramel malt backbone along with just a bit of alcohol.  M-It's at the low end of medium boied with low carbonation.  D-It's pretty easy drinking, although I finished the bomber pretty quickly and felt myself becoming a little tipsy. The alcohol is well hidden though. I've had this before and wasn't sure of the freshness then, but I haven't been impressed by this one on either occassion(it feels as though something's missing).

Nose- Spicy/earthy citrus and pine hops with caramel malt and brown sugar.  Palate- Much like the smell, but the malt makes more of a statement and seems darker than the smell, even hinting at burnt sugar. Don't be be fooled though, the hops are the stars. Dark fruits are definitely present, most notably are dates and raisins. Slight alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel- Medium to full body with carbonation coming in just over medium.

A - A moderate pour unleashes an astounding dense two-finger cream/tan head. Brilliant retention and thick collars of lace connected by wispy webs. The color is a beautiful clear red amber. Perfect looking!  S - The malty nose has a lightly toasted caramel sweetness to the background with a prominent spruce needle hop aroma up front. Good earthy floral notes too. No alcohol is present in the nose.  T - Despite it's old age, this bastard still packs a punch. The hops are forward and deliver a floral and pine punch to the tongue. Low malt that's toasty and caramel-like in nature follows. A dry, bitter finish is left.  M - Medium-bodied and mildly carbonated, the beer is left smooth with an unrelenting dry, bitter finish.

Smell - Piney/citrusy hops, with a nice, complex malt background of molasses, vanilla, and caramel. Kind of like an American IPA, but with much more malt mixed in.  Taste - Much like the smell, it's sort of like a much more balanced version of an IPA. The aggressive hops are there, but a complex malt backbone like described in the smell is there, to create a delicious, truly balanced strong ale. The bottle says I might not like this beer, but I love it!  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, and somewhat creamy as it foams up, enhancing the overall flavor experience. Ace!  Drinkability - The alcohol content and body prevent it from being a session beer, but the flavor scores it more points here.  Overall - I love the approach of this beer (""You probably won't like this beer""). It makes you want to drink it, and with good reason! It's fantastic stuff. The oaked version is even better.

147,92,BeanBone,4.37,"Appearance: A brooding red body capped by over a finger of off-white head that leaves good lacing on the trip down.  Aroma: Citrusy and piney hops over a big, sweet caramel malt body. Imagine a nice IPA with the volume turned up a notch on the malt side and you should have a pretty good idea.  Flavor: Up front, the hops grow a little leafier, but retain lots of the citrus and pine. Underneath, the big caramel malt body is sweet, roasty, and up to the gauntlet thrown down by the hops. Overall, it's bitter yet balanced nicely. The alcohol contributes some great spiciness throughout, but stays generally restrained. Leafy bitterness and sweet grains in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and a little sticky with good carbonation and a dry finish. There's a few hints of alcohol in the check and throat as it warms.  Drinkability: It treads a path somewhere between ""session favorite"" and ""punch-you-in-the-face imperial.""  Verdict: Hardly a gimmicky label-engineered beer, Arrogant Bastard is a true classic that has the chops to back its supercilious attitude.

Perhaps brewed with the blood of its victims?  Nice malty fresh pine smell. Its all blended together, nothing particularly jumps out and hits you, but its pleasing. Some breadiness.  String grassy, piney, taste, loads of malt. Very complex. Caramel about 3/4s of the way through. Complicated, but not overbearing. I begin to sense victory.  Low to medium carbonation in the mouthfeel. A strange bitterness lingers and is the takeaway - a different taste than I have experienced before.  More drinkable than I was expecting to say.

147,92,CHSLBrew,3.96,"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Shared this one with my brother over Thanksgiving.  A-Slight haze in this copper beer. Dark tan head rose and reduced to a consisten, relatively thick layer and a generous collar.  S-Fruity, somewhat grapefruity hops. Surprisingly, this grapefruitiness didn't really translate into the flavor. However, the resiny hop aroma does appear in the taste.  T-Aggressive bitterness starts right away and remains strong into the finish. Hop flavors materialize as resiny and herbal notes, pretty sticky. Malts are largely overshadowed by the straight-up hoppiness, but thwat's there is slightly toasty with a hint of toffee-chocolate in the finish. Overall, though, a very hop-forward brew.  M-Moderately big body, definitely makes itself known, while still feeling smooth. Carbonation level is medium, feels like it helps by enhancing the hop flavors.  D-Tasty, but pretty much a big hop-sided brew. Tasty, but just not mind-blowingly so. Still, a well-above-average brew.

From what I can get from the bottle, I think this one may be from 1/09, so the aroma may be lacking. Still get some strong hops, but it seems the malts are almost winning the battle. Definitely not as hoppy as a Stone should be. Hops are right up in front on the palate but fade quickly to a nice thick malty backbone. Should have reviewed a fresher one I suppose, but the taste is not lacking whatsoever. For being almost a year old, the hops are still kicking but have lost their fruity and bitter punch. Nice and thick in the mouth, not overly carbonated. This ones too drinkable, beware the 7.2% though.

Smell and taste are a beautifully complex mix of piney-resinous hops, dark dried fruit, caramel, toasted biscuit, lemon, resiny hops, tangerine, lightly jammy flavours, and a white grapefruit bitterness to finish. Tastes like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale mixed with a well-hopped IPA. Truly awesome stuff.  Medium-full mouthfeel is crisp, juicy, and tangy, with a tongue-scraping bitterness and lingering, citric aftertaste. Drinkability is off the charts, as I finished a bomber in under an hour.

147,92,Buttermaker,4.35,"You know that scene in Sideways where Virginia Madsen asks Paul Giamatti when he realized he was a wine lover...most of us have had a similar transcendental experience with beer. For me it was a mug of New Amsterdam Amber after work one night in college. Prior to that night my favorite beers were Old Milwaukee and Rolling Rock...which I still enjoy on occasion if I'm in a swilling mood. That New Amsterdam was an awakening for me, and I had a similar experience recently with a pint of Arrogant Bastard. I'd had Arrogant Bastard before but I'd never been a huge fan of the BIG American Pale Ales or (in this case) Strong Ales...too belligerent. But on this particular day what started with a sip of my buddy's draft turned into my own pint, which was quickly followed by another. The hops were so fresh it tasted like I was drinking it straight out of the mash tun, and it was big but balanced...I had seen the light...I was worthy! The bottle I'm drinking right now isn't quite as fresh or memorable as the drafts I enjoyed that afternoon but it's still an outstanding beer.

Sweet roasted malt, pine, oaky, hints of lemon and orange peel. Raisin and date again. I'm really digging this combination of flavors.  Mouthfeel is great. Carbonation leaves a bit of a flavor masking sting. That's the only reason i deducted a half point here.  Drinkability is good for this big of a beer. I could drink this all night. But it's probably not the best of ideas. =P  This is my new favorite session beer. Two or three bombers of this and I'm done for.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Magpie14,4.3,"A: hearty dark orange and deep brick reds make up the bulk of this beer. The body is also rather cloudy and has minimal transparency. A taupe head formed with the utmost fizziness, to bad it had to sink away so quickly. I notice that some sticky spider webs have adhered directly across from my drinking end of the glass and upon further inspection the lacing is quite sticky and worthy of praise...looks tasty  S: dry spicy hops of citrus and pine, with more of the latter. Fairly pungent in the nose. Some toasted malt whiffs are far back in the aromatic mix with a shot of caramel floating around. Is that some dry woodiness I smell? I even swear some raisins wallow about  T: whew...these flavors gather and stomp on your tongue. The big proponent doing the hard work, and all the stomping, are the bitter piney hops that last from start to finish, a nice bite towards the finish. A spirited toasted caramel, maybe more of a brown sugar, maltiness has its foot in the door as the hops pass right through. These malts provide a sturdy base and allows other flavors to sneak through. I swear one of these sneaking flavors has some oak aged dimensions or woody vinous citrus notes to it. Yum. All I know is that while the beer warms the flavor ambience continues to enhance. Raw hops are hanging strong as my glass nears the halfway mark. This is a monster of a beer  M: to make matters even more wonderful the feel is exactly where it should be, or where you would hope it to be. The body is medium in girth and has a delicate sticky depth to it. Carbonation plays a nice part in helping the beer move down the hatch  D: I am surprised that I never reviewed this baby. I just always thought I had marked this one off the list and when I went to check on my notes I found I had never tackled the Arrogant Bastard. Top notch beer and another ambrosial beer from Stone, truly for the gods  Pairs great with Mick Taylor's first solo album..track to note ""Slow Blues.""",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,spencerw,4.11,"A: A great beer! Dark bronze body with a thick 1-2 inch head that lingered for a few minutes leaving spotty lacing along the glass. First thought was "" good looking ""!!  S: Nothing really dominant or overbearing. Light malty, caramel nut aroma with a very subtle citrus, piney, spicy hop.  T: Just like it smells but x 3. Great, refreshing beer that is very crisp. Moderate carbonation, piney, spicy hop mid-way through with a very well balanced caramel malt sweetness. Taste a little thicker than how she smelled. Slightly stick and fairly strong.  M: Medium-bodied with a good carbonation.  D: Excellent beer. This beer isn't ""too"" filling and would make a great session beer.

147,92,rfabian,3.75,"Poured into a tumbler it forms a nice 20 mm head that leaves lots of lacing. The appearance is fairly clear amber. The aroma is a harbinger of the hop taste to follow, piney some would say. I think it's more on the grassy side with some grapefruit, especially in the finish. The taste is strongly hoppy and moderately bitter with good malt highlights. This is a full bodied brew, a pint of which leaves me satisfied.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Pours a dirty copper with a HUGE tan head on top. Minimal bubbles rising through. Excellent retention - this looks like a milk shake. Leaves tons of sticky lace and webbing all over the glass. The scent is a little underwhelming. I'm trying to get something out of this, but it's being quite abstinent. Some mild toffee and strawberry Twizzlers is about all I can grasp.  The body is a little slick and oily. Carbonation level is moderate. On to the flavor. Mmmm. Hops! Nice bittering hops right away, but not overly so; this is balanced like crazy. Lots of sweet toffee and caramel even the contest. There's a bit of a charred bread on the finish. Leaves a mildly bitter aftertaste. This is a great strong ale.

147,92,woosterbill,4.17,"On-tap into a 3/4 pint glass.  A: Clear ruby body with just a whiff of off-white head; little lace - under-carbonated? Great color, though.  S: Not too much going on (at least from what I can tell out of this wide-mouthed glass) - resinous, piney hops are up front, with some dried fruit and alcohol in the background. Understated but pleasant.  T: Piney hops, caramel sweetness, rich fruitiness, a bit of spice, and a warm boozy finish. Assertive and lovely.  M: Medium-bodied with a surprising number of prickly bubbles keeping things lively.  D: Pretty good. The hefty dose of hops keeps things clean enough to stave off the highly present alcohol heat.  Notes: Solid all-around beer, but not the be-all and end-all some make it out to be. I preferred (slightly, but definitely) the Hop Rod Rye I had last night.

Smells great, wonderful hoppy nose. Very rich and pronounced aromatics.  Tastes great. Very rich and full flavored with great hoppy bitterness and a nice acidity to balance out the high alcohol.

As a big fan of the Belgian beers, I have to admit that Americans have created a new horizon whenever they've started to overload their beer casks with hops. This is so far, the bitterer beer I've ever tasted and I've loved it. I really wish I could find something like this in Switzerland and I really regret that I didn't bring another bottle . with me... :( Despite of the advertisement in its cork, in the end, I think myself as a ""worthy one"" to drink it... That's very good stuff! I strongly recommend it to the strong ones. ;)  A: Pours a deep amber a little bit hazy color. Head is beige and creamy.

Taste and Mouthfeel:Tasted of toasty fruit, particularly grape with a bit of cherry along with plenty of resinous pine. Some subtle caramel malt presence balances out the heavy pine nicely. It was thick and sticky with some evident warmth. Sweetness came through a bit more as it warmed, really solid tasting brew with nice feel to it.

It tastes remarkably balanced. It starts hoppy and then the malt comes through in the end. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is extremely drinkable due to its balance. I drank the oaked version a while back and wasn't impressed, I think because its marketed as an extreme beer.

All in all, a well-structured ale, though a bit unrefined in its sourness.  Pours a deep burnt amber with a thick, yellow head and moderate lacing. A strong, floral hop structure in the smell with some roasted caramel malts and an oak-laden sweetness. A bit of alcohol in the nose, which rolls into the taste. Most of the alcohol and hops are present up front, which turns a bit sour on the back end, almost like a rhubarb bitterness that hide the sugars in the beer. Smooth, long draw in the mouth that is surprisingly well-balanced.

Slight pine aroma, with overtones of plums, and amazing blend of hops.  Very strong on the hops with a malty aftertaste and undertones of chocolate and coffee. Simply put, this beer tastes amazing--and its aftertaste is very fresh. It was difficult for me to notice the alcohol. The different layers of flavor make this very enjoyable. It hits hard at first, and eventually eases up.  Medium to full body, leaves a taste of plums on the mouth. It finishes clean and really feels like a great beer--just the proper thickness.

Very sweet, but very, very complex. It almost morphs in your mouth, becoming caramel or molasses at times. An excellent brew!  M: A bit of a harsh mouthfeel due to the sheer sweetness of the brew, which is substantial.  D: One of these 22 ouncers and I was happy for quite a while. It's a deceiving 7% ABV... this isn't Coor's Light.  Honestly, I don't even know what to call this beer. It's completely unique... hence why, I'm guessing, BA has shoved it into the catchall ""American Strong Ale"". It's a bit of bock, a bit of cream or coffee stout, heck, I don't know what it is.

Bitter and toasted aftertaste. Grapefruit really starts out weak and then peaks towards the end and lasts well after.  Medium bodied, with a smooth feel and nice delicate carbonation.

Full bodied tan head with hints of pastel yellow. Sporatic lacing adorns the sides.  S - The smell is nothing short of alluring! Theres pronounced roasted malts, slight sweetness of caramel and/or some fruits. There is a very faint alcohol to the nose as well.  T - Wow! Theres the malts, the well balanced sweetness, the alcohol kicks a little bit, but I feel it actually adds to the flavours rather than draw away from them. Finishes with a nice, hoppy twang.  M - This coats wonderfully, with the flavours that linger after the sip. Very rich and smooth like satin.  D - I feel as though Stone may be a hair modest in the ABV...a bit more than half way through the bomber I had a nice little warming sensation! One may not be enough, and I'd feel great having this as the staple of any night!  Notes: The bottle may say that I am ""not worthy"", and that I ""probably won't like this beer""...

There are some dark fruits, some roasted malts and coffee. The bitterness balances out with the sweet flavors of the beer pretty well. As I said earlier, this is one hell of a flavourful beer.

Malt balance evident in the nose, smells of cookie dough and slightly fruited. The flavor is quickly cookielike, but unique in the sense that it is quite dry, not sweet. Sticky, piney hops then appear and the finish is mildly peppery and sweet. Nice contrasts of flavors in each stage of the flavor profile, making a complex, drinkable brew. Actually probably reminds me more of Stone 13th Anniversary than the Double Bastard in terms of the hop profile. Medium to full body with medium-high carbonation. Maybe a touch bubbly for me.

147,92,cbutova,4.05,"From notes at the Sierra Grille tonight. Pours an extremely dark red with a one finger full, creamy off-white head that leaves heavy creamy lacing as it is consumed. Smells is surprisingly not as strong as I expected. Smells of malts, dark fruits, hops and a tiny bite of alcohol, would like more strength out of this. Tastes of malts, dark fruits (raisins, plums, some citrus), alcohol bite comes into play but is good for most of the beer (starts to take over after most of the glass is gone). Huge hops up front before any of the mentioned tastes, the typical stone hop taste. The balance is nice before the alcohol takes over at the end, some chocolate even comes into play near the end of my glass. Medium body with decent creamyness and a good balance of body and alcohol warming. This is probably my favorite aspect of the beer. Carbonation is medium and suits the beer nicely, a coat of dark fruits is left on the tongue. Drinkability is good. Good taste, the price was not too bad for the quality.

Toasty grains, hops and alcohol make for a very aromatic nose. I think I smell plums as well.  In a one-two punch to the palate, a rich malt sweetness hits the palate, with notes of caramel and toasted malts, which is immediately supplemented with a big hop profile, with earthy, pine, floral and citrus notes. All underscored by a grainy alcohol prickliness. Lingering and flavorful aftertaste.  Coarse, full-bodied mouthfeel, with great carbonation level. Rich and decadent.

Some nice floral hops that hit the tongue hard, then balanced by the caramel malts soon after. You can also taste the dark fruit as it trails off into more hops, leaving you wanting more of this complex brew.  This thing is medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. It's also pretty creamy on your tongue and goes down easy.  Wow... very tasty and complex brew that gets better as it warms.

Melted brown sugar, malts and breadiness on the nose. As it warms, the hops become much more present. Some fruits as well, but hard to place which.  Taste: Not as sweet as the nose, at all. More hop bitterness on teh finish, piney, foresty and delicious. Bready malts balance out the hops very nicely. Lost the fruit on the palate, unfortunetly.

This thing has excellent head retention, and lacing is left sticky and soapy on my glass.  Smell: Floral west coast style hops dominate here, I love the touch of sweet malt in the backdrop, it really smooths the nose out here. A bit of floral earth like tones are present as well, almost buttery in the nose as well.  Taste: What a perfect balance of full blown hoppiness to such a deep, bold malt backbone. Up front your palate is completley demolished by big, citrus hoppiness. I get tones of grapefruit and light passionfruit undertones. Towards the middle and the finish, a very sweet, yet decadent maltiness kicks in and puts this beer into overdrive. The malt has almost a nutty finish to it, very earth like and subtle. In the strong ale category, I've never had a beer that has really set the tone with balance rather then booziness. A touch of alcohol in the finish is just was this bastard ordered!  Mouthfeel: Crisp and clean! Medium bodied, almost perfectly carbonated and bitterness is here and alive! The malt adds almost a creaminess to it that is right on the point with the rest of this beer.  Drinkability: What an interesting beer to say the least, this beer solidifies the notion that I am very excited Stone has landed in Connecticut. This beer is balanced almost far too well, never have I seen a strong ale pull off not only the nice, bitter west coast hoppiness, but also the malt balance that really makes this beer a sure fire winner.

147,92,WJVII,4.3,"From my bro Steve-thanx and big ups!  Poured into a pint glass this brew is an amber color with a thick light brown head that leaves the stickiest lacing all down the glass. The aroma is very complex. There are subtle hints of caramel malts, some slight nuttiness, a mild hint of yeast, and some toffee. The taste is bold. The front is sweet with the light roasted malts and the full body has a wonderful hop balance. This brew has a nutty finish and doesnt in the least over power even with the high ABV. Wonderful example of a beer brewed by true beer lovers!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,wahhmaster,4.24,"Poured from a bomber into a nonic imperial pint glass.  Appearance: Looks really nice. Pours a brownish-amber color with a thick foamy head that dissipates really slowly. The head leaves impressive lacing all the way down the glass.  Smell: Nice and grainy/grassy. Definitely smells strongly of hops as well. Kind of reminds me of a strong IPA.  Taste: Wow. This is a hoppy beer (massive understatement). The hop character is so strong that it is about all that comes out. There is a slight alcohol taste to it, but that is par for the course for a 7.2% ABV. The hops leave a nice aftertaste that lingers for a loooong time. Once again, tastes like a really strong IPA to me but I could be mistaken.  Mouthfeel: Thick and bready. There is a distinct alcohol bite to it as well. Feels really nice.  Drinkability: A great beer. This is my first tasting of it. I had heard people raving about it on this site before but had never gotten around to trying it. Hophead beers aren't usually my thing (I know; I'm an oddity on this site) but this is damn good. Try it!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,kegger22,4.22,"Finally getting around to reviewing Arrogant Bastard after the third bomber. Not a problem, I enjoyed each one.  Poured a clear, reddish brown with a one finger head that faded to a collar. The aroma was a malt/hop blend, both there in nearly equal parts. The taste was a nice balance of the bitter and the sweet too. Citrus hop bitter along with a caramel sweetness, but bitter wins a close one by an aftertaste. The feel was medium bodied and oily, with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was good.  Grades out somewhere between Double Bastard and Oaked Arrogant Bastard. You've got to love the bottle design though, don't you.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Reaper16,4.05,"22oz. bomber served into a tulip Thanks bunches, BdubleEdubleRUN My 100th review! Wheee! As such, I'm going to detour from my standard verbosity and do a quick review in between rounds of ""The Beatles: Rock Band."" I deserve it.  Pours a dark ruby with a superfluous, three finger head. The lacing is rocky with large bubbles all down the glass.  Its all hops in the aromas. Pine and grapefruit. Maybe some lemon, but an astringent lemon -- like pine-sol. There is a considerable deal of sugary sweet malts, too. Some limited alcohol fusels come and go. A strong ale indeed.  Mmmm! Arrogant Bastard is a nice, hoppy brew. I've never had a strong ale as hoppy as this. It exists in thie strange borderland where it doesn't taste like an aged double IPA and it doesn't taste like a barleywine. Its malty as heck, sweet and rich, but it doesn't skimp on the floral, flavorful hops. There is sort of a key lime element on the back of my palate that sits on top of the grapefruit flavors. Yummy.  My typical preference for hoppy beers is to be light in mouthfeel, and Arrogant Bastard fits that bill. It has moderate-to-high carbonation and is light enough to give off feeling that you're drinking ""hop juice."" Drinkability? Absolutely! This is a damn solid, hoppy beer that I would get down with anytime I could. I would buy this with some regularity if I could.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,alkemy,4.47,"Poured a deep amber out of the bomber. When held up to light, beautiful chestnut is revealed. Head is off white (slightly yellow) and left its mark all down the glass. Grapefruity hops is the first scent followed by caramel malts. The hops definitely dominates. I'm a hophead, but I really appreciate the balance of this beer. The odd thing is that right in the beginning, you get a hint of malty sweetness. This sweetness is very quickly overpowered by a nice hit of hops, and then reappears on the back-end. The carbonation is right on tingling the tongue along with the hoppy bite.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,scottyshades,4.37,"A: Pours a slightly opaque dark rose color (almost looks brown) that produces a decent off-white head. The retention is good, lacing is thick, cap is tight.  S: First thoughts are wood...specifically wood you would smell in barrels. Spicy hops, caramel, molasses, dark fruits (raisins), a citrus twang, and a sharp alcohol bite.  T: Pretty damn complex in my opinion. Lots going on, slightly overwhelmed, but it all comes together. I actually get more oak in this than the oak-aged AB somehow. A lingering malty sweetness is present, caramel, molasses, (the fruits died down a little) and the nice hop bite that balances this big beer quite well.  MF/D: Medium/heavy body, very smooth and slightly subdued carbonation, and a nice long caramel/hop finish.

147,92,TheFlern,4.67,"Appearance: Khaki head and a nice maple coloring. Good lacing.  Smell: Balanced between sharp hop notes and roasty malt notes.  Taste: Hoppy fruitiness up front with a nice transition to the malt flavor as it sits on the pallet. It finished leaving a nice manly and delicious bitterness just urging you to enjoy the next sip, if you are worthy.  Mouthfeel: Nice and smooth. It doesn't attack the pallet with too much carbonation and feels like a nice strong ale should feel like in your mouth.  Drinkability: No need to rush through this one. Sit back and enjoy the ride as the beer warms up and the flavors come out.

147,92,alleykatking,4.2,I've had this beer millions of times and am just now getting to writing a review for it. Poured from 22oz bottle.  A- Pours a nice deep amber brown color which is almost just a dark dark brown. Produced a nice 2 finger tannish head that once died down all the way left very nice lacing all over the sides of the glass.  S- Just like I have smelled time and time again. Nice piney hop smell over powered by a grapefuit/citrusy hop overtone. Sweet bready malts come through in the backbone of this beer. Also detect a slight roast or toasted malt smell to this. Smells great!  T- Nice hop kick right from the get go. The citrus hops reall do their work in the front of the beer. In the middle there is a sweet roasted bready taste ending with a nice bitter bite in the tail end of this beer.  M- Medium mouthfeel with this beer. The carbonation was very well done making this beer a enjoyable sipper. Leaves a nice hoppy/malty combo on the tongue. Makes you want to take anthoer sip right away.  D- This has always been and will be one of my favorites and I can always come back to it. Would be a good beer for someone who wants to try something big and bold.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,infi,4.3,"The gateway brew that got me into craft beer. Decided to re-review this bad boy.  Poured into a nonic pint.  Pours a rustic dark golden caramel color that's barely translucent and forms a thick tan head with a nice amount of retention time and lacing on the glass. Smells exactly like I remembered when I first tasted it. Piney hoppiness and grapefruit juice and rind are the most prominent, with the bready malt and subtle spice underlying the rest. To me, it sort of has a soapy scent overall in a good way.  Taste is exactly how it smells. Delicious hop goodness throughout the mouth. You can really taste the pine characteristic to the beer, alongside the breadiness of the malt. It's like a piece of spicy bread with a sort of cinnamon quality to it. The flavor then follows to the sweet and sour citrus of the grapefruit and short astringency of the hop bitterness that lingers for a couple of seconds in the aftertaste before dissipating. And finally it all ends to the gentle warmth of the alcohol left in the back of the throat. The mouthfeel is just right, with a medium body and enough carbonation to the brew. The bitterness isn't as discouraging as I had originally thought when I first tried it, so I say that the drinkability is excellent. And it's definitely more of a drinker than a sipper. Such a reliable strong ale, I can always go back to this brew. Thanks again, you Bastard! I still am not worthy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BeerPhan86,4.32,"After really enjoying Double Bastard some time ago, it is time to review its single version. I have had this many times on tap but never reviewed it. Here goes.  A - Pours a deep ruby brown with a one finger tan head. It appears almost hazy in the glass.  S - Lots of big malt scent in the aroma, with a nice hoppy overtone. There is an earthy, citrust aspect of the aroma as well, most likely due to the hops.  T - Very very hoppy upfront, with some bitterness and grapefruit in the middle. Finishes sweet and malty. This has a very heavy, bready taste most likely due to the maltiness. I think it is both very malty and very hoppy but also nicely balanced between the two. Reminds me of a very hoppy red ale, like Southern Tier's excellent Big Red.  M - This one seems to have a heavy body and moderate carbonation. Nice and chewy almost.  D - I don't know how I ever used to get through pitchers of this while in school. Packs a punch, but is a nice treat once in a while. It does go down easily for such a high abv beer, but it seems heavy in my stomach as well.  This is a great and unique beer. If you like this definitely try the Oaked and Double versions, both were excellent.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,KarlHungus,4.42,"This beer pours a ruby-brown color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit, citrus, and pine. This is the strongest grapefruit smell I've encountered in a beer. The taste is almost a grapefruit like as the aroma, but not quite. There is a nice bitterness in the finish too. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a really nice beer. I held off trying it for a long time, because I really did not like Oaked Arrogant Bastard. This beer seems to me to have a lot more complexity.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,afausser,3.7,"Served in a pint glass at McGrady's in Charlottsville.  Appearance: A very deep, translucent copper. Okay lacing, but I'm not particularly impressed by that or by the lack of head/head retention. Of course, this could have something to do with the pour, but in my experience there was little to no head and what there was did not last.  Smell: I wasn't able to get too much out of this one, but it was also served in a pint glass, so I'll have to give it another try later and see if my opinion changes. What I was able to get were grains, sweet malts and citrus--lemon and grapefruit. Nothing too surprising, but decent.  Taste: Very, very hoppy, and along with that, the taste of very bitter (but delicious) grapefruit. Heavy bread flavors, as well as a hint of caramel.  Mouthfeel: One of the best parts of this beer, in my opinion. Not too much carbonation--good with this much flavor--and it goes down pretty smoothly. Not much of an aftertaste considering the amount of hops, and what is present is a light grapefruit. Additionally, I'm not noticing any warming, (which I do like sometimes, but works well with the taste of this one). I approve.  Drinkability: A decent, drinkable beer, which hopefully will be more appreciated when I try it outside of a bar and in a proper glass.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Mavajo,3.85,"This beer definitely lives up to its billing: its quite the assault on the tastebuds. There's a lot of complexity here that my novice palate couldn't distinguish. I found it to be quite hoppy and intense, but still very drinkable. The taste improve as it warmed. It's recommended for drinking in the 50-60 range, but I really started to enjoy it as it warmed to an almost lukewarm temperature.  I tend to favor beers with a more ""session beer"" drinkability, but this still stuck my fancy. Deep copper color with decent lacing. Definitely a must-have for any hopheads out there.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,apbarwood,4.15,"A rich copper color with a tan head. Hangs around with some good lace. Smells of sweet malt flavors and citrus (lemon rind?). The hops are strong with a lot of lemon citrus flavor but the toasted malt acts as a strong counterpoint and really softens them. It has a campfire quality in the taste that I found very appealing and definitely something that lends this beer to a more dynamic range of food pairings than perhaps a straight American IPA. A nice display of flavors overall and a good, dry finish on the end. I think this was Stone's original flagship beer before the IPA caught on and it's easy to see why. It's a lovely beer that is worth a try and one that is definitely worthy of it's level of respect and popularity.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,augustgarage,4.08,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. Extremely popular beer here in Los Angeles, hopefully a gateway to craft beer for some, though many more probably buy it for the label. Anyway:  Liquid is a distinctive combination of rust, scarlet, and mahogany topped by a dark kahaki, thick, creamy head with good retention and lovely dense lacing. Dark but clear.  Prominent hop aroma with an interesting balance of floral, berry, and citrus - caramel-like malt presents strongly as well. Molasses, goji berry, and light brown sugar are in there too.  Toasted malt, chocolate, grapefruit seeds, toffee, and flamed orange zest suffuse the palate with an unusual balance of flavors. Alcohol seems strong for the ABV, but adds significant flavor. A collision of styles that really works...like a barley-wine influenced amber (red) ale.  Smooth, velvety, medium-body with good mouth-filling effervesence.  Overhyped for sure, but this is still a unique and tasty beer - worth trying if you haven't.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Smell: Chock full of hops and toasted grains, there is a hint of fruit and esters.  Taste: Such a rich and complex brew that goes down smooth. Starts off with a caramel malty slickness which intertwines with a buttery cornhusk dryness which is then kicked into high gear with a massive wallop of herbaceous hops to round it out. Finishes with a lingering sweetness, caramel, roasted coffee.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and carbonated, in a nice balanced way. Leaves behind a ""bastard was here"" bitter stamp but then fades away into a coffee/sweetness.  Drinkability: Goes down so easily for a 7.2 abv, i accept the challenge to continue drinking.

147,92,deapokid,4.48,"Decided to sit down with a classic and give it the full once over.  Pours a thick and commanding off-white head. Deep amber color seems a bit too candied and pretty for what this complex beer has in store, but it certainly looks fruity and enticing.  Scent boasts a rich, malty character with hops immediately stepping forward. Notes of tart citrus fruit and a confrontational dryness are also present.  Taste is citrusy, dry and hoppy. The conclusion packs a nice maltiness and, as it warms, the hop character takes a back seat to a buttery richness. A nice grapefruit bitterness peaks out towards the end of the glass and I totally love the fact that this brew doesn't totally rely on hops for its flavor profile. Complex and innovative.  Upon first taste, the liquid sizzles on the front of the tongue and gradually dries out as it moves along. The aftertaste is decidedly citrusy and floral, while never being wimpy or over spiced.  For a beer with 7.2% alcohol and a wide range of bold flavors, I'm quite impressed with its chugablity (which would be more commonly associated with a pale ale).  This is a profound beer that lives up to all the hoopla and the essay on the bottle is an arrogant call to arms for all craft brew fans.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I get made fun of by my fiancée for smelling the beer in the restaurant we are in.  Taste - Complex and relatively consistent with the smell. I am expecting the ""oaked"" arrogant bastard taste seeing as that is the only arrogant bastard I have ever had before and I love dearly. The non-oaked is pretty flavorful on its own surprisingly. A bit more bitter from the hops than I remember from the oaked, but nonetheless pretty good.  Mouthfeel - The feel is nice, medium bodied. You can taste the hop oils and alcohol on the tongue and the carbonation lends quite nice to the appropriate thickness.  Drinkability - Quite drinkable indeed.

Actually the head disperses VERY slowly, it starts quickly but then seems to stop. Lots of foam and lots of lace.  Smell: Hops all around. Does have a slightly toasty-sweet malt aroma, but mostly I can smell nutty and floral hops with hints of grapefruit.  Taste: Begins with an apple-like sweetness, finishing very bitter and nutty. Hints of buttered toast and, as the smell suggested, grapefruit. Notes of alcohol as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Thinner than what I expected, but still has a medium body. Very smooth and the alcohol warms you right up.

A malty richness is there, but is hard to separate from the huge hop boat.  T- Wow. This beer is no joke. A huge hop wallop is counterpunched by an amazing, rich, deep malt. This is almost like 'beer extract', by far one of the most flavorful beers I've ever had. Compared to my notes from the Oaked version, this one is a lot more 'in the raw' as far as flavors go. Fantastic.  M- Fantastic, awesome, great, amazing... I could go on. This is a world-class beer.  D- moderate though enjoyable. This beer grabs you by the throat and demands to be enjoyed.

Mango, pineapple, pine, grapefruit, tangerine, some malt sweetness. As the beer warms, a slightly peppery alcoholic aroma comes forth.  Taste: Not as complex as the smell would indicate, although still exceptional. The sweetness of the malt gives a very nice caramel/brown sugar backbone that provides a backdrop for the HUGE citrus/pine bitter flavours from the hops. Alcohol taste is present, but becomes more prominent as the beer warms.

Smells of bitter hops and maple syrup and something like green wood.  Initial taste is mildly malty sweet and mostly just a fresh barley taste. The dry hops are very pronounced immediately after the first part of the taste subsides and they stay through the aftertaste. There's also a slight brown sugar sweetness accompanying the hops.  Mouthfeel is thick but mildly coarse from a subtle carbonation that is present but doesn't bubble in your mouth. Goes down very smooth.  Delicious but a bit too hoppy for me personally. A must try for all but will appeal to hop heads more than others.

147,92,oldpinecone,4.33,Poured into a pint glass.  I need more of this beer.  Pours a deep ruby color...It looks like the walls of rich sophisticated mans library. An offwhite 1 finger fluffy head is great too. Lacing is sticky and stays clinging to the glass all the way through.  Smell is really citrusy with an apparent malt presence. The hoppy smells are there such as light light floral notes but theyre hard to detect.  Taste is freakin awesome...an arrogant bastard indeed. Vicious flavors of hoppy bitterness along with that light citrusy finish. definite one of the more aggresive tastes ive had.  Mouthfeel is great. Very nicely carbonated not too thin and not too thick. Perfect constistancy for this the style.

Which takes a while to dissipate into a nice thick soapy lacing that clings to the glass. Ruby/Dark reddish brown that is only slightly translucent when held up to light.  Smell: Dark caramel and toasted malt, dark fruits and a high level of hopping.  Taste: Toasted malts give off a carmaley taste, followed by floral and slightly fruity esters revealing cherries and other dark fruits. The fruity esters create a sweetness in this beer that is quickly cut by coarse hops. It really makes a great juxtaposition between sweet and bitter.  Mouthfeel: For being such a dark color and so full of flavor the mouthfeel is actually really light. But this light and pleasant mouthfeel is cut by the distinct bitterness of hops.  Drinkability: This beer dares you to drink it. It tells you won't like it. Part of its arrogance is that it is a fantastic beer. It has some complexity but its not too much to take it. Arrogant bastard has a huge character. It may tell you that you're not worthy and you may not be.

Very sweet malty aroma with a bit of earthy/hoppy notes to it.  The taste is slightly boozy for it's 7.2abv, but also really malty.

147,92,kwakwhore,4.58,"The first time I had this beer I was definitely unworthy and incapable of appreciating its full worth. I decided to wait to review it until after I had had it a few more times. Had the other two members of the Bastards, double and oak-aged, and finally came back to this one. Times, and my taste buds, have definitely changed. A: Dark, reddish, brown pour into a La Fin du Monde tulip. Long lasting light tan head which leaves copious lacing on the glass. S: Some hops and some dark fruit on the nose. T: This is one hell of a beer on the tongue. Hops and malt form an inseparable synthesis on the front end, a bit of bready/biscuity malt in the middle, and a two stage bitter, hoppy finish. The finish subsides to the point that you think it's over with and then you get an extra shot of grapefruit hop bitterness. Bitter chocolate becomes more and more prominent and some roasted porter-like accents emerge as the temperature warms up. M: Lush silky mouthfeel which is rounded off by some understated carbonation. D: I shared this bomber with someone special and I'm very glad I did because I brought another convert over to the Bastard, but I could easily have finished this on my own(and have done so in the past). For a beer of its strength it is way too easy to drink. The original dark, hoppy ale from Stone, the first of several.

Smells of pine and citrus with a spicy presence in the back.  Hops hit hard at the first sip, spicy, piney, citrusy all there. Some hints of brown sugar come in at the finish. Not exactly balanced nor is it really intended to be, but more malt presence than they would have you believe.  Meidum bodied, fairly smooth. Drinkability is a little hard to rate for this one, its gotta be a matter of how accustomed you are to this kind of stuff. I've given tastes to the so-called ""fizzy yellow"" beer drinkers described on the label and they weren't too thrilled...but personally I love this stuff. So if you've ever had anything even slightly on the extreme side, this shouldn't be too overwhelming.

Definitely a complex brew. Malt upfront with a brown sugar and spice flavor followed almost immediately by the hops screaming for attention. The bitterness numbs my tongue for a moment but the malt makes one more appearance before the taste dissipates and I'm more than ready for my next swig.  M -- Fairly heavy on the palette with moderate carbonation. I typically enjoy a bit more carbonation with a beer that has a pronounced bitterness as this, but in this case the carbonation is perfectly suited to the tastes.  D -- Delicious and will become a staple.

It's interesting that this is one of Stone's flagship beers, as this is one of the less hoppy beers I've come across from them.  Smells of pine, brown sugar, plum, our apple, chocolate malts, dried fruit, cinnamon, fine spices...  Tastes very tart, malty, dark sugars, vanilla, cherry...almost along a German beer style...very malty...hops come through in the flavor, but do not overpower the fragile malt flavors residing in this beer. Some taste of banana, clove, cinnamon, light chocolate flavors.  Overall, this is a great beer. Well balanced and delicious. There is a lot of flavor here, and I like that this beer is not completely overpowered by big hoppy overload. The flavor holds up and the beer is quite drinkable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

In the middle of pouring the head seemed to erupt suddenly into a 2 inch off-white/light tan head.  Citrus, pine, and grapefruit hops followed by syrupy caramel malts in the background.  The taste was a welcome surprise. The bitterness attacks the tongue. While I have no complaints about the smell...the taste is much more exciting. Roasted malt, caramel sweetness, a touch of vanilla, citrus and all-out bitter hops. The flavor envelopes my entire mouth. It's almost like I have gained extra taste buds.  The mouthfeel is crisp but full-bodied. Again, the flavor fills my entire mouth. It also seems to have one of the longest finishes I have had in a beer in quite a while. It seems as if perhaps the taste may never leave my mouth.  It's hard for me to rate drinkability. Most beers with this much flavor tend to have a lot more alcohol.

Hops come through the fresher it is. Citrius and grapefruit hop character. There is a good finish of a bready yeast to finish off the smell.  T - Very strong caramel sweet malts assault the palette up front. Bitter hops then meld into the beers taste. A clean finish is achieved from the proper yet not overpowering hops. A slight dry sweet malt after taste  M - Full bodied. Carbonation is medium. Some alcohol warming is present.  O - Awesome ""go to"" for a strong American ale.

Slightly fruity. Fresh floral  T - An initial sweet maltiness, entwined with a hint of grains. After the sweetness, this ale turns incredibly bitter with dominant hops, supported by floral undertones. The aftertastes bitter hoppiness is accompanied by a noticeable kick from the alcohol.  M - Medium bodied, and slightly dry. The alcohol also provides a nice warming feel.  D - This is the first beer from the acclaimed Stone Brewery that I have had the chance to try, and the hype is justified. This ale's bittersweet profile of flavours provides a beautifully balanced beer, with just enough kick to make you realise that you are drinking a strong ale.

Aroma carries some fruity hoppiness, with some bitter smelling herbal and earthy notes. I'd prefer it to have some more aggressive hops in the nose.  Taste is bitter, just bitter enough to be considered aggressive and make you wince a bit, but still enjoyable as more than just a hop delivery system. Malt character is big on this beer, with some toffee notes reminding me of a bitter heath bar.  Mouthfeel is heavy, smooth, and not too bubbly despite the grand head of foam that sticks to this beer. A bomber of this beer is a nice treat, but I wouldn't want to have much more of it.

147,92,ClevoPiwo,4.08,"Looking through the selection at the local beer store, I realized that the last time I had tried Arrogant Bastard was a few years back before I really had gotten into craft beer. So, I figure its worth revisiting.  It pours a nice deep brown, amber color with a nice sized head that stays for a while before dissipating into a foamy cap on the beer that reforms after each pour. After the head dies down there is a visible lacing. This is a good looking beer.  The smell is a complex bouquet that is well balanced between the hops and malt flavors. The bitterness and floral quality of the hops is definitely pronounced but it is appropriately supplemented with notes of malt sweetness and fruity esters.  The taste is complex and consistent with the smell. There is a touch of malt sweetness up front that rather quickly gives way to the big hop flavor that lingers on the palate into a dry aftertaste. However, despite being big on the hops, this beer has a sufficient body and malt presence. As it warms up the malt is a bit more pronounced as is the alcohol.  Overall, a very well balanced yet complex beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,hossua34,2.73,"A - Dark mahoganey wood brown with a dirty tan head, medium in size. Good lacing. This beer lost a whole point from me in this category because of labels on the bottle, which basically insult you and say that if you don't like this beer it's because you aren't sophisticated enough. For questions and comments, it basically suggests you go **** yourself. I am not overlooking the whole ""Arrogant Bastard"" theme here, but I just spent over five bucks on this one tall bottle, so this type of self-important crap is pretty annoying.  S - Pure hop oil. Tart, piney grapefruit smell and something like celery (???).  T - Holy bitterness. Tons of hops, little else. Not that I know, but this is what I imagine pine tree sap would taste like. Aftertaste = grapefruit. A hint of malt sweetness is almost detectable for just a second, then it's gone. Almost zero balance; just tons of hops.  M - Thick and warm, due to the high ABV.  D - Between the extreme dose of hops, and the sharp bite of the relatively poorly-hidden alcohol, I'm ready to switch to something else after about 8 oz. Not my style whatsoever.  This ale was way, way, way too hoppy for my tastes. Evidently - or according to the packaging - this is because I am a giant moron and a sissy when it comes to beer. I know I'm probably taking the damn label WAAAAY too seriously, but in my eyes if you put statements like that on your bottle, your beer sure as hell better deliver. And Arrogant Bastard simply did not deliver. It reminded me of the compressed pellet of hops I tasted when I toured the Anheiser-Busch brewery in St. Louis. I had some other Arrogant Bastard beers on my to-try list, but I will cross them off unless someone wants to throw a bottle my way for free.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I think as a beer lover there are some brews that you simply have to try - lets call it an essential list of beers. They may not be the best, but they help to serve as reference points that we can all understand, and they expand our knowledge of the noble drink. I'd put Arrogant Bastard firmly in this category. For many people its a staple and, I feel, sometimes overlooked because of the craze for something 'bigger'. Lets not forget, though, that the bastard weighs in at a hefty 7.2% with some lip-smacking IBUs to boot.  A deep copper body supports an effusive, foamy tan head, that not only lasts for the whole drink, but also leaves attractive streaks of lace on the glass. Its a beautiful beer to look at. A leafy, floral hop aroma with a caramel and fruit base seems to pull my lips closer to the glass. There's a slight alcohol note in the back end, but its not overly apparent - rather functioning as a reminder that this is a beer of strength and character.  Great hoppy flavours as the liquid hits the tongue. Fresh, leafy hops deposit a coating of bitter oil before a toasty caramel maltiness takes the reins, adding depth and complexity that most beers can only dream about. The balance is excellent, especially considering how hoppy the beer starts out as. The body is surprisingly heavy, and just short of chewy. It actually matches the weight of the flavours quite well, especially with a moderate carbonation to keep things lively.  I liked this a lot. While I wouldn't say it necessarily stands heads and shoulders above the crowd, it is definitely in an upper tier of beers, and I'm very pleased to try this again.

The hop flavors got better as it warmed up as it gets much more of a citrus and pine flavor.

147,92,Kickass,3.36,"I pulled this beer from the fridge and let warm for about 30 minutes before pouring from the cleverly insulting 22oz bomber with a slight degree hurt feelings.  A- Initially viewed in low light the beer has a color range some place between a dark mahogany and very translucent light brown. When held up to natural sunlight through the window this beer has a beautiful red mahogany brilliance. The head is a nicely defined slight off white color that starts out with very densely packed small Co2 bubbles that grow larger and more defined the closer they get to the beer. The retention was good and left a nice asymmetric spider web lacing.  S- The smell was difficult from me to really dial in on. There is no doubt that the smell has a nice degree of sweetness, the hard part was placing it. What I decided on was slight hop aroma, not much though, and more on the piney side. Next was defiantly a fruity sweetness, tough to nail down but more along the line of subtle darker fruits. Finally was the malty caramel sweetness.  T- The first drink was filled with hop bitterness and very little hop flavor. Upon subsequent sips the matly sweetness was discovered as the beer first comes into contact with the tongue, if you're not looking for it, it is quickly over powered buy the hops, a fault of the beer in my opinion. I feel this beer is slightly out of balance even being an American strong ale. I'd have liked to get a more malty base out of it to complement the bitterness of the hops.  M- The mouth feel is nice, the viscosity is just enough to evenly cover the tongue yet it is not overly heavy. The carbonation lends greatly to its appropriate level of thickness.  D- I feel the 22oz bomber is quite appropriate in terms of drinkability. This is not a beer I'd like to drink more than 22oz of throughout a session.

The aroma is faint but,there. I really had to get my nose in this one. It smells of citrus and hops. The taste was wonderful. There's the initial bite of the citrus hops and nice caramel smoothness that makes this very drinkable. The mouth feel is pleasant with a decent heartyness moderate carbonation.

I wasn't expecting so much hoppyness in this one, really surprising, albeit fantastic. The hops are offset by the upfront maltyness. The hops last in the aftertaste.  M/D: Very thick and full bodied. Goes down smooth, I was expecting a slight bite with the ABV being 7.2%. I could see this being a session beer without a doubt.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

S - sweet alcohol, a little leathery - but in a good way  T - very malty, some hop bitterness, a touch of burnt caramel, and a very slight hint of fruitiness.  M - fills the palate and stimulates all parts of the mouth. Goes down smooth and warm (7.2%)  D - For a 7+% beer this is about as drinkable as it gets.

147,92,BirdFlu,4.2,"Pours a very nice auburn color, dark amber with lacing white head. There is a lot of hop presence in the aroma and flavor, a sort of fruity hop, but not to any extent where its overpowering. A very nice balance with the malt, as well. Caramel and molasses-like characters from the malt are just behind the hop to give a warming, full flavor. Mouth is very nice, full but not chewy. Its got a light feel for the robust flavor and full body. Perhaps not one of the best, but very, very good. I had this for the first time a very long time ago, before being introduced to many other beers and styles. Since then I had tried double bastard and oaked AB, but hadn't come back to the normal version. Certainly a pleasure.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,bluemoonswoon,4.35,"Finally, finally the often immitated, never duplicated Arrogant Bastard. Since I first discoverd what a strong ale was, I've had this beer in my sights. I've had other Stone beers, I've had the Double Bastard, and the Oaked Bastard, but the one, the only, the origanal Bastard has escaped me since I foolishly passed up purchasing one at Dark Lord Day 08. Two plus years of reviewing later and it's finally time to crack this bomber open.  A: Clear and dark russet copper with an inch and a half of inital head that fades in a few minutes to a thin beige cap. Little lacing, not much, but such a pretty color.  S: Like Christmas in July, this is one piny, nutty caramel, darkly sweet fruitiness.  T/MF: Mellow pine, but deeply bitter, almost creamsicle like fruitiness, a dark, sugary mix underscored by the abbrasive bitterness that is constant here. It's a difficult flavor to pin down but a completely unique flavor non the less, I'd say a bitter (not sour) pine cherry, brown sugar and strawberry preserves on toast. So toasty. Wow. Mouthfeel is solidly chewy, rich but not cloying, firm carbonation, not overly bubbly and overly burpy.  D: It's fucking good, a great sipper, something new and a reliving of the previous sip, developing and revealing and reconfirming with each sip. You can't beat the original. This is really something special.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,wl0307,4.6,"Purchased from the BSF bar of GBBF 2008; coming in a 1 Pt. 6Fl. Oz. brown bomber bottle, served cool in Tripel Karmeliet's branded long-stemmed, tulip-shaped goblet;  A: pours an ultra elegant dark mahogany hue, coming with fairly good clarity and moderate, fine fizziness; the dark beige creamy froth comes thin but tight and creamy, lasting loyally throughout the drink. S: tell me what's the difference b/w this and an ""American DIPA""?... maybe the colour and (by inference) how much dark malt takes up the overall percentage of the ingredients. Apart from that, the aroma here is just as marvellous as any heavily hopped American ale - the creamy malt, sweet nutty, sweet coffee-ish, raisiny and longan-fruity façade cannot prevent the rich, spongy, thickly aromatic hoppiness from sneaking through. The fantastic lychee-ish hops are truly pleasantly pronounced but not quite as sharp or lively as other heavily hopped ales by Stone, maybe due to the equally assertive presence of complex and oily maltiness. T: simply sublime - the lubricating hoppy swallow of grapefruits and lychees fruits along with lots of mixed dried fruits is never far from semi-toasted walnuts and jammy malts; the aftertaste develops seamlessly following the tail of the main flavour, not so sharp but rather 3D-structured bitter, as a sign of interaction b/w dark/lightly-toasted malts and quality hops. The finish goes especially enticing but deep, where the chewy part of the almost roast tea-ish hops creeps down the palate and renders a dry but soothingly bitter finish down the wings of the tongue. Not to be ignored is a delicate touch of black cherry, licorice and spice that adds to the overall complexity. This is an Anglo-American hybrid ale at its best, I reckon. M&D: due to successful bottling, the palate is really fresh and helps to lift the weight by a good margin with only the necessary dose of soft carbonation; the flavour profile is balanced, deep, yet overall surprisingly approachable - I find myself in deep thought about the structure of this ale and blissful imagination of how it might have tasted on the cask-conditioned form... Truly, a ""well-hopped premium bitter"" like this (this is how I appreciate this ale, regardless of any self-acclaimed beer style imposed here or by Stone, which it hasn't) shouldn't be an ""Arrogant Bastard"" in any sense. Frankly, I've never been able to grasp the humour (or pretentiousness) of Stone's beer-naming ""strategy"" (on top of lines and lines of unnecessary/redundant/quite uninformative explanation on the back label for many ales they bottle), which is quite a failure; but, I loyally love their beers. This AB is firmly on my top 3 from this brewery (so far) without a doubt.

Looks thick, but is well filtered. head formation is out to a couple of mm, and is well retained. Brown in color.  S - Dominated by crystal and caramel malts, very sweet on the nose. A hair of american west coast hops and yeast breadiness back it up. I do detect just a whiff of phenolic notes.  T - Starts off with the strong wallop of speciality malts, caramel and roasted notes combine. Mid-stream gets a big bitter beat down, where cascade or centennial hops really take over. Alcohol note is just slightly noticeable. Finishes back with a malty cloying sweet taste. Aftertaste is muted.  M - Very thick beer. Full bodied from all the sweetness. Carbonation bite is light. Some alcohol warming is present.  D - This beer probably doesn't fit the definition of ""drinkability"" All the flavors are good, the carbonation and palette fatigue are light. But, the ABV can knock you around and the beer just doesn't stand as a sessionable beer.

A - Pours a rich brown/dark amber, with a thick pillow of golden-hued, tan head. A nice cap with numerous patches and strands of lace.  S - Solid, though not massive, tones of rich caramel malt and floral hops.  T - Moderate caramel sweetness, complex malty backbone, nice hop balance (not overpowering). Hops and roasted malt linger after the swallow.  M - Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Pleasant and quaffable.  D - A very interesting, complex, and sophisticated brew indeed.

S- Has a hoppy aroma up front along with plenty of rich, roasted malts and coffee. A bit of a sweet smell to it also.  T- The roasted flavors come through nicely, but the complexity of the beer leads it to finish off slightly bitter from the hops. One of the more complex beers I've drank so far.  M- Plenty smooth with a medium-heavy body. Goes down incredibly easy, good amount of carbonation.

147,92,DeathbySexyBT,4.37,"This is, by far, one of the best beers ever bottled. I cannot stress enough just how much this beer has changed my appreciation for hoppier beers. Many moons ago, I was a malt-head. I am now proud to declare my undying allegiance to the hop. Stone makes some of the best beers I have ever tasted. If I were to recommend one beer over this nectar of the gods (would devil be more appropriate?) it would be their Ruination IPA.  A: Rust-red, with a nice sticky/firm head and lacing.  S: Strong hop aroma with a hint of roasted grains and floral hues.  T: The taste lives up to the name of this beer. The very first sip can feel like a kick to the teeth, but in a good way. Rich and complex. I recommend drinking this beer cold but not so cold that it won't warm as you drink it as this beer exhibits different exciting characteristics as it warms. It is kind of dry, not overly astringent, and finishes almost sweetly. This beer is high on the hops, but the malts used balance it out perfectly. Flavors: hops (duh), coffee, caramel, roasted grain.  M: Appropriate carbonation. A lingering aftertaste that leaves your mouth feeling pleasantly hoppy.  D: This is a strong beer. As such, it will catch up with you. Much like Ruination, this beer will make your next beer taste weaker than it would on its own.

Carbonation was good, clarity was great, and there was some nice lacing.  S: Smells like ripened berries, orange peel, lemongrass and floral hops. There's a little sweet funkiness to it as well.  T: Taste is quite lavish and complex. A lot of deep roasted caramel malt flavors at first, very rich. This is balanced by a fairly aggressive floral and citrus bitter hop component. The fruity ale flavors are deep and varied, lending flavors of apple, berry, pear and a touch of citrus.  M: Mouthfeel is full bodied, but slightly creamy and sweet.  D: At over 7% ABV and with a full array of ale flavors, this brew is great to have on its own if you're willing to deal with the dizzying flavor profiles and the imminent hangover.

Lots of hops and malt bouncing back and forth across the palate. It's hoppy and bitter, nutty and malty all swirling around with a good carbonation level. This is a very complex and well balanced beer. The alcohol is present but not too noticeable.  This is the beer that introduced me to the appreciation of good craft beer.

I think the ratings of all the other beer advocates speak for themselves but I just had to review this beer. If you have ever had the opportunity to try Stone's Ruination and thought...WOW...I love hops but that could be toned down just a bit then this is the beer for you. For my palate, very similar to the ruination with a bit more maltiness and a bit less of the piney bitterness.  A-Beautiful...poured from 22oz. bomber into a pint glass. Not a heck of a lot of head when poured correctly but it's wonderful reddish brown color more than made up for the lack of head aesthetically. S-Again, Very Impressive with a pretty complex floral/pine/citrus hop aroma. I'm not expert so I can't pick out all the little aromas just yet but the hops are sure in full bouquet here. T-Obviously, as with any great beer this is where it blew me away. Rich nuttiness to balance and intense (but not too intense) hoppy bitterness and as smooth a beer for the ABV and Hop content as I've ever seen. M-The carbonation in my bottle was a bit higher initially than I preferred but I took my time with this one and it played out well within a few minutes of being in my glass. D-More drinkable than it's big bro (Ruination) but still not a beer that you could knock back for hours on end.

147,92,sensorglitch,4.37,"Poured beer into glass. Color was very good.

147,92,nomomentwasted,4.25,"Arrogant Bastard is an old stand-by and a nice example of a strong ale. It was one of the first microbrews I ever had and I have had it several times since, and it is a nice change of pace from time to time when I've been drinking nothing but IPAs or Stouts. Had this in a pint glass from a bomber.  Appearance: Darker reddish brown with a frothy white foamy head that laces pretty solidly down the glass.  Smell: Never anything too powerful or aromatic, but definite hop presence with a citrusy grapefruit style aroma, but the malt is very present in balance as well, with much of a caramel style hint to it.  Taste: Bitter hops that are present in the nose are the first taste, followed afterward by a solid malt backbone and clean finish with residual bitters. For the style, it's hoppy and bitter (Stone's calling card) but in comparison to their IPA or many upper-tier IPAs in general, it's pretty well-balanced.  Mouthfeel: Smooth finish after the bitter start, not too oily but not over-carbonated either. Finishes like an ale does, with the alcohol being warm only after the swallow and definitely not overpowering.  Drinkability: Usually a bomber is enough for me, and it drinks a little slower than some of my favorite IPAs, but it definitely is consistent and tasty throughout and doesn't ever get too difficult to drink. I'd imagine most every good beer drinker out there has had this due to Stone's fantastic distribution scheme and power, but if not, it's certainly a great example of the American Strong Ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Bitter throughout with a nutty-bitter slightly astringent aftertaste, which really lingers. A faint mustiness can be tasted, which seems odd and out of place. A real hoppy kick in the crotch.

Smell - Roasted sweet malts, a bit of alcohol and a small citrusy hop presence. Maybe a bit of chocolate, coffee, this smells like one badass beer.  Taste- Malty yet hoppy, extremely good. Dark sweet malts met with Stone's great citrus hops. My tongue is so confused, its picking up the sweet and the bitter on nearly the same area. Boozy in the finish.  Mouthfeel - Mouthfeel is good for a beer of its size. Not too heavy, just about right. A bit chewy and dry.  Drinkability - A bomber is enough for me for one sitting.

Nothing too deep or esoteric here, but it's not trying to be funky or terribly complex. This smells like American ales should smell!  T - The hop bitterness is well-complemented by the bready, sweet malted barley flavors. Usually, big ales have a tough time keeping the balance through the finish, but I give props to Stone for brewing a bold strong ale that finishes so smoothly and well-integrated.  M - Good carbonation, not too syrupy despite the big, sweet malt flavors - again, everything works well together.  D - This is a highly drinkable brew that could very easily be confused as a session brew. The 7.2% sneaks up on you, as it is so deep and enjoyable that you'll drink it more quickly than you should.

147,92,Wutz,4.32,"Reviewed and submitted on 6-19-09  I got this guy at Davidson's in Denver when I was down for a weekend of family stuff. I had heard a lot about it so I grabbed it the first time I saw it. I'm glad I did.  Appearance - A firm pour gave me three fingers of head perched atop a burnt red mass of goodness. The head subsided with in minutes and added a bit of lacing to the glass all the way down.  Aroma - Earthy, orangy and a little earthy hops right away. After sitting it down for a minute, the next whiff gave me pears and caramel. Odd...  Taste - It starts with a big bunch of sweetness followed by a bucket of bitter. I got brown sugar and caramel with some fruitiness and then the bitter truck shows up which leaves an almost stinging bitterness that can only be quenched by another drink. As it warms the malt seems to give a toasty and grainy version of itself. I keep getting a small but unpleasant dose of alcohol with each drink. I don't feel like it enhances the brew at all.  Mouthfeel - This guy is creamy and thick. It definitely encouraged picking the glass back up and having another swallow.  Drinkeriness (because I hate ""drinkability"") - It's best described by the inner dialog I noticed myself having during this review: ""Why does it take so long to take these notes? I should be drinking this beer instead of writing about it."" The taste makes you want to drink a few of these (if I had another) but the bit of alcoholic taste makes me slow down the process.  Overall, this is a great beer. I'm really happy that I went (way) out of my way to grab this when I had the chance. I definitely be doing my best to get ahold of another one when I'm in a Stone-friendly area.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,GweedoeBRew,4.22,well... just what you would expect from Greg.... a beer named for him... JUST KIDDING!!  I think that what Stone is doing is great. Greg Koch has brought the beer that is brewed on the left coast to the peak... With the epic series... and the other beers Stone is brewing I never pass up a bottle of something new when i stop at the beer store.  Arrogant Bastard... the redish appearance almost makes you think that you are going to drink unfermented carbonated wort...

147,92,GarrisWH,4.28,"A - Pours a clear, dark brownish red color with about two fingers of thick, frothy off-white head. Good retention throughout drinking and leaves intricate lacing down the glass.  S - Spicy, citrus and pine hop aromas with a sweet toasty malt presence.  M - Quite similar to the nose. Great, complex hop flavors with hints of citrus and pine and spiciness. Has a nice, crisp, bitter bite. Balanced with ample caramel maltiness. Really a very tasty beer.  M - Medium bodied with a moderately resinous feel. Nice and smooth going down.  D - Very tasty, drinkable offering. Full flavored and nicely balanced.

147,92,atpben,4.85,This was my first Stone beer and it very quickly became one of my top 5 favorite beers. Poured the bottle into an arrogant bastard glass. Poures a wonderful dark red color with a thick white head. The beer is all about the hops mixed perfectly with hints of carmal and vanilla. Wow what a great tasting beer. The pine and citrus keep coming in and out throughout. Lots of malts to back the huge amount of hops. Nice long hoppy bitter finish. Great beer. Only problem is two bomber is enough for me although I want to keep drinking. Liquid gold.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Pours a copper/redish brown. has a nice off white that gets about 1-2 fingers thick in these glasses, but lasts a while. leaves decent lace. Smells hoppy, almost similar to the IPA. Hits of citrus and caramel. Almost if they mixed the ipa with the stout, but not as strong in either direction. It's a strong flavor, but not overwhelming.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,angelmonster,4,"Had this on tap at Falling Rock  Pours a 2 finger white head, body is dark brown with amber highlights. Head retention and lacing are good  Smell is of sweet fruit, caramel malt, and faint earthy hops  Taste is of roasted caramel malts. There is also some dry fruit too, maybe prune. Hops are in the mix but are secondary. The after taste is slightly metallic with some alcohol but not much. The more I drink it the more it tastes like a blend of a light barleywine and a Doppelbock.  Mouth feel is good. Nice balance of carbonation. Medium body with some creaminess in the head  Drink ability is also good. Alcohol isnt very present so it is semi session able but very flavorful. Over all this is a great beer and always a reliable choice",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,sweemzander,3.67,"22oz. bottle poured into my Duvel glass. No bottle date or drink by date present. Awesome looking label though.  (A)- Pours a medium reddish brown/mahogany that has a slight cloudiness to it. The off white head was at least 3-fingers and is still staying strong! Its almost thick like Cool Whip!  (S)- Rather closed and tight in the smell department. However, I am getting a mix of hops and malts. A small bite of some spice and lemon-pine coming through.  (T)- Wow, serious hops blast at the beginning that really coats the tongue with the telltale bitter, lemony-citrus pine essences of hops. It then mellows out at the end into an interesting tea-like flavor; like a fruity Earl Grey or Darjeeling tea with some honeyed malty sweetness.  (M)- It has a good carbonation level that intermixes well with everything else. The 7.2% alcohol is hidden really well, so it can be deceiving! Its got a good bite to it, but is also smooth on the finish. Good complexities of both flavor and texture. It actually reminds me of Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot Barleywine to a certain extent.  (D)- The balance of bitter and sweet really brings out some complex flavors in this guy. The alcohol is hard to find amidst the bittersweetness, but it could sneak up on you after a few, but I definitely wouldnt mind having 2-3 of these no problem.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Sperzel,4.79,"22oz bottle... very inviting label :)  Dark, blood red color with bright amber hues. A good amount of sticky lacing, leaving interesting shapes down the glass. The smell is amazing. Complex mixture of hops, fruit esters, and toasty grain malts. A musty aroma perhaps created by the arrogance of this bastard. I dare say this beer has hormones!  Roasty caramel flavor. Big malty hit with a good amount of hops to round it out. Very smooth, big and bold, rich and complex. A big wow with the mouth feel. Medium body, yet a huge flavor. The juicyness of hops, the chewyness of chocolaty malts. The bitterness mixes well with the sweetness reminding of straight-up raw chocolate.  This beer is a flavor sensation. It's sweet, bitter, and musty in a way to put hair on the bottom of your feet. Such a complex array of flavors, enough to label this as brewing genius.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,PintOHops,4.37,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a wine glass.  Appearance/Smell - Appears a beautiful dark amber/brown color with a perfect frothy head, carbonation can hardly be seen through it's wonderfully dark cherry glow. Head retention is decent and it leaves some patchy, spotty lacing. Smells pungent, floral & spicy! Lots of dry, floral hops flood the aroma, fruity grape, cherry, apricot, dates, plum, and grapefruit. Undertones of grainy malty notes, some caramel & a tad of chocolate in there, and of course alcohol, which becomes sharper as it warms.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes intensely of fruits, over ripened plum, cherry's, black cherry's, black berry's, peach, grapefruit, the fruits are all over the place! Lots of burnt biscuit like hop bitterness that lingers, subtle molasses, some semi sweet grainy, malty flavors in between everything, finishes very dry with alcoholic flavors of course. As it warms the alcohol becomes stronger & burns the mouth a bit. Mouthfeel is creamy, chewy, silky, full bodied, and some sediment can be felt as it goes down.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - I couldn't wait to put down a review on this one, this beer is intense, pungent, in your face, and leaves you thinking about what you thought was a good beer. I absolutely loved everything about this beer, especially the flavor & the outstanding body, I got to say that I'm not big on the alcohol burn of these stronger brews, but I'm willing to over look that because this is just to good. I could have a couple pints of this stuff when the day is done, and I'm ready to just unwind and let the fruity, pungent hops flood my brain. Highly recommended. Cheers!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,TheMistler,4.08,"A darkly copper / amber brew, with lively carbonation creating a substantial off-white head. Good retention. Pretty thick lacing.  Aroma is sweet malt initially - lots of caramel - with a wave of citrus hops coming through. Hops become a little bit sharp. A nice nose, I like the sweet / sharp interplay, but it doesn't stand out that much to my mind.  The taste, however, does. Notable malt, but it is more overwhelmed by the hops in the taste than it is in the nose. This is not a bad thing, and the malt still provides a slight but nice counterbalance. Some caramel, even toffee notes hovering in there, but a good bit of the malt sweetness combines with the hops to provide a sweet orange note. The hop profile is pretty full: citrus, as noted, along with pine and grass. The finish is slightly resin-y, slick, with with notable bittering lingering on the palate.  The carbonation finds a nice middle ground - not particularly prickly, nor giving way to too much creaminess. A full but not particularly heavy feel.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BZero007,3.71,Pours a ruby brown color with a very good head for a strong ale. The head sticks around and helps with the aroma as much as it can. The aroma is pretty weak even when compared to other strong ales. The smell is of a mild fruit that seems to have been toned down. The taste was good and refreshing. Brew is of a low body and I would say drinkability is good as the alcohol does not hit you right away.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,velosuds,4.88,"From a 22oz bomber  A-pours a beautiful copper red brown. This produces a substantial cream-colored head with strong retention. Lacing is even all the way down the glass. The bottle is a work of art, as is this exemplary brew. Never see comments about sound, but this was music to my ears from bottle to glass.  S-enticing, menacing. Even suggesting I am not worthy. Beckoning me to determine if I have the sophistication to appreciate this brew (you gotta read the label).  T-I'm too much of a neophyte to describe all the subtleties I enjoy reading from other reviewers. However, I immediately knew this is a substantial brew to be reckoned with. This is a complex, balanced, quality beer I will definitely be wanting again. Hop bitterness at the beginning that finishes with a pleasant sweetness. Can't fully describe the taste in between, but I think I am arrogant enough to be worthy of this very fine brew.  M-substantial yet smooth, even delicate. A definite sipping beer because you don't want to rush past any of its nuances. I love this beer.  D-22oz tonight will be enough since it is quite filling. 7.2% ABV is dangerously masked. I don't notice it in the taste. Very drinkable. So much so that I am actually glad it cost $5. I will treasure this one in the future, albeit sparingly, looking forward to each time with anticipation.  I have wanted to try this for some time now. Been in my fridge about 3 weeks. Tonight was just the right setting. In Salem, Oregon, we got an exceedingly rare tornado warning about 4:00 this afternoon and the storm that blew through disrupted my outdoor activity plans this evening. I wasn't arrogant enough to challenge the elements on my bicycle. So when I looked in the fridge and saw the gargoyle, I knew this was the right time. I had high expectations and was not at all disappointed. Except, when the last sip was over.  I love reading the label.

Nice sticky lacing is left on the glass. Nose is surprisingly more on the hoppy side - citrus hops, some pine, but nicely blended with caramel malts. Taste is outstanding. Starts of with a big citrusy hop bite then leading in to darker malts, caramel malts and finishes with a slightly piney hop bite. This is an extremely well balanced beer that has big hop and malt presence but blends so well while moving in to the next flavor.

It's a very nice-looking, darker beer.  S: Very fruity hops. Rich.  T: They got this right. The hops are fruity, strong, and bitter, but not overpowering. There's an undercurrent of sweet malt, almost caramel. There's some kind of strange spice to it, almost like cloves or allspice. The flavor is very bold, rich, and yet not overbalanced in any direction. I haven't had any of Stone's other offerings, but if this beer is any indication, they're a top-notch brewery. Truly outstanding.  M: Medium, good carbonation, smooth with a bitter finish. I like it. The mouthfeel doesn't do anything crazy for me, but I like it.

I can smell the hops from a distance kind of fruity, and there are even some sweet bready, caramelly malts in there. Overall, a very nice mix of smells - almost straightforward, and sort of wavers between bold and subdued. I like it. The flavor comes up kind of like the smell. Not a harsh bitterness, but there's a good kick. Also, not a huge amount of hop flavor - I get some spiciness though, like mint almost in the finish, though I know clearly that quite a bit of hops were used in here. The maltiness shines through pleasantly, biscuity, kind of sweet. Overall, the taste is very nice. The mouthfeel is a little bit disappointing when compared to the rest of this beer. Mine seems a little watery, kind of clingy, and there's an odd burn (I don't think it's alcohol related) as it goes down. This one drinks pretty well. I mean, it's a well-executed beer.

No need to stick the nose in the glass, as you get big pine hop aromas as you pour. Some sweet malt in there somewhere, but good luck hunting for it.  Huge sticky pine hop bitterness upfront, with rich sweet caramel toasted malt in the background. I noticed the booze, but only after a couple of sips -- the hops hide it well. The bread toast element is there at the finish and then gone as the hops fight through for one last kick in the teeth.  Nice mouth-coating chewiness here. Carbonation is fair and appropriate.

Head formed slowly, tiny bubbles that dissipated quite quickly leaving nice lacing.  Smell is hop/ alcohol forward, pine notes along with sweet, sugary-malty accents.  Bittersweet, caramel toned up by a nice piney hop kick on the back of your tongue. That nice hop bite almost totally covers up the alcohol, although when it starts to warm up there is a trace metallic taste in the finish. Even warmer and a bitter toffee flavor emerges and the brew really smooths out.  Mouthfeel is suitable for the style with decent carbonation (wish the was more.)

I'm going to assume that I just had a bad bottle though, and rate it from the first couple bottles. It pours fairly dark with a nice piney scent, with a hint of citrus. The taste is just about what you expect from the scent. Hoppy... very hoppy... with a nice caramel flavor. The feel is good, and the drinkability pretty good. One bottle was enough for me.

Seriously, there are clumps of head/lace hanging onto the side of the glass like a spiderweb.  Nose is all ""big"". Big sweet brown sugar and toffee, plus a hint of molasses. Big pine/herbal/citrusy hops. Healthy dose of booziness. Not doing this justice- it smells damned good.  This stuff tastes great. Caramelized brown sugar and black strap molasses burn up front. Lots of caramel malt sweetness. Plentiful dark fruit- raisins, dates, plums, maybe even cherry- and baked apples yielding to a earthy, piney, and citrusy hop explosion.  Medium full body with fairly vigorous carbonation. Chewy and sticky. Something about this beer invites you to chomp on it a bit and explore the complexity.  Overall impression: My wife's favorite beer, and for good reason. Somehow it manages to be aggressively malty and aggressively hoppy at the same time. Great brew, one I like to have in the old beer fridge at all times.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,beer2day,4.05,"Pours a lot darker than expected. No hint of black or even dark brown, but just a very opaque redish gold. Thin head, but decent retention. Little visible carbonation. Good lacing.  Nose is a little fruity. The body of the beer is evident in the thickness of the aroma coming off the head. Lot of malt in this one.  Hits thick. Finishes thick. I don't even want to know how many calories are in this beer ... because I'm going to drink a lot of them. There's a hint of peatiness here (ala a scotch ale), but the alcohol leads you to a barleywine feel as well. A lot of complexity going on.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Gosox8787,3.73,"Picked up a growler at the store today. Served into a glass mug in two parts. I also have to add the note at the back of the beer was pretty funny and entertained my friends I was drinking with. Onto the beer.  Poured with a beige, one finger head. The beer was dark amber to brown in color and almost appeared black at points. The nose was balanced between pine notes from the hops and caramel sweetness from the hops. The taste was dominated by the hops, although there was a significant malty backbone. Pine flavors came through the hardest. There was a noticeable bitter aftertaste after each sip. The malts were not quite strong enough to shine through the hops. Mouthfeel was heavy with a slight carbonation, about what you would expect. The drinkability was not really high. After the growler, I did not feel I needed any more. The alcohol is not noticeable at all, however.  Overall, a good offering from Stone. It is certainly not my favorite from them. It reminded a lot of Troeg's Nugget Nectar, although I preferred that. Note: I drank over a half and hour and allowed to warm to room temperature. The flavor was enhanced by this and I enjoyed the second half of the beer immensely. A good but not great offering.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Psilo707,4.29,"Pours a really deep mahogany red with tons of bubbles rising to the top immediately. The head and lacing are both solidly thick and lasting. Smell is absolutely awesome, and I'd have to say this beer has one of the best aroma's you could ever possibly smell, 5/5 without a doubt.  Tastes extremely piney with a very distinct low-tone sting to it. Unique to any other beer. It's well-balanced and there is an alcohol bite at the end of the sip.  Mouthfeel is creamy and its presence is heavy. Drinkability is a bit lower than the other aspects, I've never been one to down too many Stone's in a night, but still decent.  Overall this is one of the most popular microbrewery beers out of San Diego for a reason. Great stuff all around.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jimj21,4.25,"Twenty twp ounce bomber poured into a wine glass. This one pours an opaque caramel-copper color and is topped with two fingers of beige head. Retention is decent with lots of lacing all around the glass.  Smell is pretty good. Actually quite malty, but the hops are definitely present. Maltiness is caramel and burnt sugar. Hops add a nice citrusy character and some spiciness too.  Again, the maltiness is really coming through. There is a lot of caramel sweetness. A little smokiness as well. In my opinion, the malt character actually is pretty similar to that of Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA. This fades into some spicy hops and a touch of citrus. Nice bitter and piney finish.  Good creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation level is good. Could be a little smoother, but good overall. A little alcohol heat on the finish.  This was good overall. There is a nice balance between the hops and malt. This is an older bottle, so the hops have faded a bit. Still very good though. Another winner from Stone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Appearance - Dark amber with two fingers of foamy head.  Smell - More hops than expected. Lots of sugars and caramel too.  Taste - Sweet with a nice hop balance. Like the mixture of a DIPA and an Altbier. Great!  Mouthfeel - pretty heavy but not too much.  Drinkability - High.

147,92,ffejherb,3.68,"22oz. bottle into goblet on 4/27/09. Thanks to FooFaa for sharing.  A - Poured an attractive clear ruby red body with one-finger beige head that settled into a patchy film and yielded some elaborate lacing on the sides of the glass.  S - Sweet and sugary nose with an earthy hop character and a hint of floral notes. I also detect a dark fruit presence that suggests raisins and apricots.  T - Dark fruit notes up front with the aforementioned raisins and apricots paired with a subtle resiny hop character and earthy notes, albeit a bit restrained. Definitely not as aggressively hopped as I was anticipating. Hop presence is a bit muted overall.  M - Medium body with a warm, bristly mouthfeel and slight syrupy texture. Mild bitterness on the palate.  D - I found this to be good but not mild-blowing. Perhaps the bottle was slightly past its prime. I would like to sample this on tap soon, because I know there is potential here.

Pours a dark brown-copper color with two-fingers thick of pinkish/tan head that seems to not want to go away. Very nice feature.  Aroma is slightly earth hoppy with a caramel aroma along for the ride. A lot of yeast hits my nose actually after smelling multiple times. Very nice nose.  Sipping reveals a rather malty flavor. Some caramel flavors come through along with a fruit flavor maybe of plum from what i can gather. A slight biscuit flavor comes through as well on the swallow with a slightly boozy aftertaste. Very very nice. Afterflavors is rather hoppy honestly...interesting!  Well-balanced carbonated body with a slightly chewy body. Drying finish with solid flavors throughout the experience (up front through the swallow and aftertaste).  Too yummy for words! Very drinkable in flavor and feel, but scarily boozy to end an evening early. Be very very careful with this one! Cheers.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The taste starts off With some sweet malt that is cut pretty quickly by some citrusy hops followed by some piney and floral hops with a good balance. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Some hops provide a piney and floral character, but the malts take center stage.  This remains sweet throughout, the hops adding flavor and bitterness, but never working their way to the top. The pine character provides a drying astringency in the finish. I'd almost rather it weren't so sweet.  It won't be hard to finish the bomber, but I doubt I'd want more right away. That seems like enough for a sitting.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jonziefle,3.63,"Appearance: Poured a dark brown, hard to see through, and slightly cloudy. Two finger khaki colored head, with good retention. Very good lacing.  Smell: Smells of stronger hops and fruit. Darker fruit combined with citrus (grapefruit), pine, and raisins. Not much in the way of malts, in the nose.  Taste: Interesting balance of hops and malts. A nice hop bite to start, but darker and smoky malts move in quickly and overwhelm the hops. Not quite an ""aggressive"" beer as Stone suggests, but quite a bit stronger in flavor than a traditional ale.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied beer, a little harsh in the mouth, but not too bad. The flavor coats the mouth and lingers. Chewy.  Drinkability: A decent IPA, one to try just for reading the bottle. It is decidedly more ""aggressive"" than the normal ale, but a little too dark and raw for me. Not enough hops, and too much malts.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Taste: Some malt taste at the beginning with a great deal of pine hop taste and a strong bitter kick at the end.  Mouthfeel: This is a nicely medium carbonated bigger beer. It is somewhat creamy.

T-A nice hoppy bite with a complex palate of flavors including citrus, nuts and malt. Outstanding in my book.  M-Surprisingly smooth with a nice balance of carbonation. But this is a full bodied ale that really coats the tongue. Nice!  D-For a brew of this magnitude, it is surprisingly drinkable. Friends have said one is enough, but I disagree.

S: Has a fairly weak smell, mainly hoppy pine scents.  T: Big hop presence, which stays around on the aftertaste. Malty caramel flavors are there in the background, but add a lot to the complexity. The alcohol seemed fairly well hidden.  M: Smooth and nicely carbonated, full bodied but not sticky.  D: Drinks easy, could probably drink a lot of this. Quite hoppy, so the drinkability would be lower if that doesn't sound like a good thing to you.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Stays around until the very end, really amazing retention. Good lacing too.  S- The smell is the weakest part imo. That dosen't mean its bad though. There must not have been much dry hopping, in this beer. I expected a little more complexity in the nose. But the malts smell good and sweet, some biscuit and sourdough malt smells too.  T- The Taste is just so smooth, every single sip is complimented by the beautifully foamy and fluffy head. Light hop character is balanced wonderfully by malt flavors. This all blends well with alcohol flavors and warming sensations.  M- The carbonation is super smooth, and leaves the mouth dry.  D- The brew is incredibly drinkable and a bomber is the perfect ammount.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,DoctorDog,4.16,"Presentation: 22 oz bottle into a nonic.  A- Clear reddish amber. Pours with 2+ fingers of creamy tan head, which fades very slowly to a solid cap; incredible retention. Ample lacing.  S- Spicy pine hoppiness. Lightly fruity yeast and sweet maltiness. Slightly weak on the nose, and several notches bellow the level of intensity I was anticipating.  T- Sweet caramel malt on the front, and then followed by the assault of pine/herbal hops bitterness. Herbal bitterness lingers on and on.  M- Moderate carbonation with a pretty full feel. Actually fairly creamy, and goes down smooth....oiliness builds and coats as consumed. Alcohol warming is occasionally noted, but not persistent.  D- Good. Standout appearance, ok nose, flavor to spare. Slightly high ABV and intense bitterness would probably limit me to one 22oz'er...but then again, that's more than enough.

147,92,cavedave,4.72,"A brick/dark amber clear shining liquid, a crown of almost white thick foam, gargoyle arms of thick lace as the head backs down. Beautiful.  Nose is a complicated perfume of all that is good in two row malt, ale yeast, and amazing quantities of finest hops prepared by artists. I would buy a cologne with this fragrance were it available.  The flavor is complex and insane. Sweet carries biscuit, bitter, floral, citrus hints, pine teases, apricot teases, earth teases, whiffs of yeast, and hints of alcohol into a balance beam of pleasure that ends in dry herbs and dark caramel. It is a wave of flavor that rolls across the delicious pleasure centers of my mind and soul. It's warmed a bit now, must be high 50's, it's even tastier. Absolutely insane flavor ecstasy.  Mouthfeel is stupendous. Like strong ale? You'll f*g love this.  Drinkability is the top feature that absolutely sets this beer apart in this style. It is way way way too drinkable",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Buschyfor3,4.08,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a tall mug.  A: Pours deep, rich amber that glistens in the light. A small, thick, creamy orange-white head peaks on top, two fingers thick, and slowly dissipates. White lacing clings to the side of the glass.  S: First thing that hit my nose was the smell of hops - spicy herbal, citrusy, pine notes. Smells like an IPA. I can also pick out a faint sweet note (maybe molasses, caramel or dark dried fruits like dates). I don't really detect much of the roasted barley which is mentioned as an ingredient on the label.  T: Sweetness up front reminiscent of molasses and burnt brown sugar. Then the hoppy bitterness strikes through the sweetness, with citrusy grapefruit, and rind-like flavors; also picking up the flavor of pine nuts. Malty, yeasty bread notes, buttered toast, and a roasted, nutty flavor dominate in the finish. Really complex and I know I'm not hitting all the flavors on the first go-around. I don't really detect much alcohol in the finish, but as I work my way through the bottle, I start to get a warming feeling, so I know it's there!  M: Carbonation creates a slightly crisp/tingling mouthfeel, similar to what you would expect from an IPA. As I swirl the beer across my tongue, I begin to notice a slick, syrupy texture - not thick, but this beer is definitely not light bodied either. In my mind, this is the definition of a well-rounded, medium bodied ale.  D: 7.2% ABV, but the alcohol is hidden all but for the slightest bit. One bomber would definitely be enough for me, but you almost need a second just to re-experience the complex flavors within the body.  Wow, what a great ale. I think the warning on the label is correct: you won't be able to fully appreciate the complexity of flavors in this beer. I'm afraid that my tastebuds are not yet sophisticated enough to pick out every flavor which overwhelmed my palate; but that doesn't mean I won't try again. I'll look forward to having another bomber of Arrogant Bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BarrelO,4.3,"22oz bomber poured into a pint glass.  A: Dark brownish red with a white head that leaves a good amount of lacing.  S: Nice balance between citrusy hops and sweet malts.  T: Begins with a huge blast of hoppy bitterness. It eventually settles down to establish a perfect balance between malt and hops, like a caramel-coated hop flower.  M: Medium to full bodied with a good amount of carbonation, so it ends up quite filling.  D: The definitive example of the American Strong Ale style. Maltier and more complex than an IPA, but not quite big enough to be a barleywine. Needless to say, it's a classic amoung American craft brews. It's not for beginners, though. It takes a pretty weathered palate to withstand the flavor assault and appreciate everything that it offers.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

T= Starts out really malty sweet and the finish comes more hoppy. The start is thick caramel malt almost toward chocolate malt with the sweet pineapple hops coming in toward the end. A little rugged in the taste with a long hoppy finish on it. M= Not quite dry but not really coating either. Like I mentioned before the taste lingers and is quite rugged. D= Great beer but I don't know how many I could possibly have before it would be too much. The finish lasts a long time and the beer is high in booze.

It is dark bronze, almost black, with a magnificent head and terrific lace. Somehow the smell and taste manage to be gritty, bitter, and smooth; extreme and drinkable; citrusy and woody. Experiencing Arrogant Bastard Ale kept me grounded--kept me in the moment, only more so. A wonderful beer.  While very good at everything, it is not distinguished at any one thing.

Appearance - Dark orangish brown. A light tan head that isn't going anywhere anytime soon.  Taste - Initially it was a hops. Then you got the sense there was a significant malt backbone trying to break through. After the initial hoppy bitterness fades you're left with a excellently balance beer. Probably the best balance of hops and malt I've ever had. Can't help but wonder what a few months would do to this beer.  Mouthfeel - Thin plenty of carbonation and a nice hop oil coating.

Huge citrus smells, grapefruit rind, stong hops like a pine resin.  There's a lot going on here. Taste the grapefruit and maybe lemon zest, moderate hops have a decent bite on the back end. Alcohol washes over you in a pleasant way. Full-bodied, moderate carbonation. Good mouthfeel, but you should slow down with this one.  Fairly drinkable, seems stronger than the ABV rating says it should be. Wouldn't pair it with any foods that have similar citrus or bittersweet flavors because of the big citrus aroma and flavors, but it would go great with barbecue or spicy food.

Poured into my pint glass, I got a two finger, rocky head atop a clear, deep amber body. There was a lot of lacing as I consumed this nectar.  Aroma was grapefruit hops up front, with a hint of orange atop a lovely caramel malt base. Well balanced.  Taste started out with nice bitter hop resins with a touch of citrus, on top of a sturdy malt backbone with notes of caramel.  Mouthfeel was firm, thick and chewy without being too overbearing. Enough malt to let you know it was there, not too much to overwhelm.  Drinkability is good.

Looks really nice - pours a cloudy mahogany, reddish brown color with a foamy light tan head that lasts for a long, long time. Gobs of sticky lacing just cling to the glass for the entire 22oz. Looks rich and inviting!  The nose has some piney hops, lots of caramelized sugar and malts, some spiciness which I can't put my finger on, and just the slightest hint of alcohol in the background. Quite a unique smell - not sure how they do it, but it's awesome.  Taste is just awesome. Love this beer. Big on the malts, mostly toasted caramel, some light bittersweet chocolate notes, some spicy grainy nuances, and a really tasty citrus/pine hoppiness to finish things off. Really delicious.

147,92,kshankar,4.4,"Appearance: Dark copper color with an off white head with great lacing all the way down. Layer of foam stays at the top as well, to the bottom. Carbonation can be seen as well in the copper.  Aroma: Sweet malts and of course...hops. Citrus leaning on the hop side. Good blend of both aromas here  Taste: There is a malt sweetness..but there is also a great taste of the citrus hops creating a perfect bitterness. Each flavor transitions to the next perfectly  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, smooth going down...has a nice creamy feel to it as well.  Drinkability: Tastes incredible with great mouthlfeel. Slightly on the higher ABV side..but whatever. And I went through the 22 oz pretty quickly.  Highly recommended. A hoppy beer of this sort comes late in a beer drinkers evolution..but once you're there, its out of this world.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Darker then I thought it would be, a deep reddish brown. Good head that goes away after a few minutes, but leaves good lacing.  I expected hops but I was hit with stone fruit aromas, most notably apricot. Very pleasantly surprised.  Nice taste. Good and hoppy. Stone fruit persisted, but faded to caramel finish and aftertaste. Slightly malty too. Very long finish with grain/grass notes.  Slightly bitter, slightly astringent, and sour, just how a good american ale should be. Moderate carbonation persisted throughout the bomber.  Versatile drinkability, can be sipped or swigged. I would say more a sipper to appreciate the fruity nuances and excellent finish.  Very good. I'm definitely gonna be drinking this one a lot.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The chef paired this with Pan-Seared Local Grouper over a Charleston Okra Gumbo. The gumbo didn't stand up to the beer. I would've liked a little more spice in the gumbo but overall a brave and beautiful pairing by the chef. Awesome dinner - if you ever have the opportunity to go to a dinner or tasting with a Stone beer rep DO IT - truly a great beer experience - very nice/easy going/like family atmosphere with great stories, cheers, and presentation.  Appearance: Dark Amber/Brown  Smell: Pure Hoppiness...  Taste: Perfection - hoppy bitter - sweet finish - hop malt with definite hoppiness up front.  Mouthfeel: Fullbodied with nice tannins.

Nothing too distinguishable.  T = Very, very tasty. A luscious caramel/brown sugar malt sweetness jumps out in the start. A very strong grapefruit hop bitterness more than balances the taste through the end. A sincerely robust flavor experience here. Too much of either would be detrimental, but the arrogance of the front and back flavors balance out perfectly. You bastard!  M = Medium to thick, with very noticeable oily thickness. Just coats everything, letting you know who is boss here. Subtle carbonation.  D = Somehow drinkable despite the audacity of its flavors and mouthfeel. The 7.20% is well hidden.  Just a great, complex, balanced and robust brew and it will be a staple henceforth.

Bit of a grainy/bread smell.  T - Excellent balance of the hops and malts. Probably one of the best balances I've found so far. Slight hint of grapefruit. Again, like the taste, grains and breads. Very hearty.  M - Smooth, carbonation is just right.  D - Easy. Very easy. And at 7%+, I'll need to be careful with this one.  Overall, an excellent ale.

S: Not what I was expecting. A few hints of piney hops, but mostly sweet, sweet malt. Some hints of graham crackers.  T: Initial sweet malt character that gives way to a wonderful bitterness. I felt like I got lost between all of the malt characters and hop bitterness. Hints of oranges, grapefruit, even a trace of plum quality that gives way to some pine and a touch of earthiness. It's almost like my palatte didn't know what to make of it. Delicious.  D: I'm still in awe of this beers balanced characteristics and exceptional flavors.

The aroma of this bastard was mainly piney, grapefruity, and even a little sweetness. It tastes very sweet upfront, a mixture of different malts with that uniique stone yeast strain. It then turns into a complex mix of hops and malts, which isn't too bitter, just right. The back end is very nicely accompanied by various hops flavors and bitterness.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Head pours big and fades, from where the liquid beer starts and the top of the head ends, from dark, burnt brown, to light white. Lots of small, bubbly, lace on the surface.  S- Complex- has the maltiness of a dark ale, and the hop presence of an IPA.  T- Smooth, creamy, sweet. Well balanced with flavors. No single flavor is over dominant. The flavors dance across my toungue with the elegance of the Russian ballet, but reality sets in and I realize that the dancers are 400lb sumo wrestlers. Metaphor= Sweet, innocent, beginning; hostile, deceitful (heavey) finish. Leaves kind of a bitter, unpleasant, aftertaste.  D- Heavy but, yes, drinkable.  Notes: This is a very tasty beer.

M - Smooth and slightly sticky. Good body, semi thick. D - This is easy to put back which could be dangerous in that 7% tier.  Oddly enough, this is the beer that got me into IPA's.

M: Medium body with some bitterness. There is a certain creaminess to this beer.  D: This is a very fine beer and one I could drink over and over.

Smell is much more subdued than I expected - very well balanced with hops and a definite malt sweetness. Not the hop bomb aroma I was braced for.  Taste follows smell but is extremely well balanced, which I again did not anticipate. Very nice.  Mouthfeel is ok but if there is place to complain on this brew, this would be it. Just does not finish as clean as I would have preferred.  Dangerously drinkable.  All in all, a great beer and well deserving of the hype and it's reputation.

147,92,FallinDeck,4.17,"It has a nice slow pour, with a candy/ruby/brown coloring to the body. The off white head had some good lacing but nothing to write home about. OK smell, I never have liked grapefruit it should not be consumed by any human. Health nuts eat it all the time, what's up with that?? I get the eating things that don't taste like anything, but eating grapefruit is just nuts. The only way I was able to eat a grapefruit was with a whole sh*% lode of sugar to drown out the grapefruit, till I couldn't taste it anymore (I will never consume it again). It is in my opinion that grapefruit is one step away from being a poison to mankind. With all this said... WOW who knew?? The smell of the bitter grapefruit coming off this beer made me skeptical, but then I had to taste it. There has never been a place for the grapefruit taste till now. The taste of the grapefruit and spice was very pleasing. Good mouthfeel with the spice and once it goes down a good finish spicy kick hits your taste buds.

147,92,GilGarp,4.38,"This was one of the first BIG beers I ever had (about 8 years ago) and I wasn't a fan. Since then, my tastes have evoloved and I figured it was time to give it another try.  Pours from the bomber to a pint glass with dark red amber color and good clarity. The head is thick with good retention and the lace sticks to the sides.  Aroma is full of earthy citrus hops. There is also a certain pilsner quality to it. Maybe they used pilsner malt.  Flavor is excellent and there's lots going on. The malts seem like that of an uber red ale with just enough roasty toasted malt. The hops impart a spicy bitterness. It all works together beautifully and the balance is great.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and not far from creamy. The low level of carbonation certainly helps here. It doesn't even need to be served very cold. Drinkability is also quite good for the style.  This is one beer that deserved a second chance.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,alcstradamus,4.01,"A--Very dark amber/red that was pretty much crystal clear. Standard pour yielded two fingers of off-white head. Tons of lace. Very nice looking beer.  S--Smell is mostly citrus hops with a pine backbone. Some apple skin and pears also.  T--I let it warm up a bit because otherwise I was expecting nothing but cold bitterness and instead I just got a lot of warm bitterness. The hops are fairly well balanced, usually with this level of bitterness I get a much more piney taste but this beer is actually relatively mellow. Maybe thats because I had a Ruination the other day and this is like childs play compared to that beer. I'm not a huge hophead yet but I like the taste of this quite a bit.  M--Medium bodied and very oily. Level of carbonation is about perfect.  D--Like this bottle says, this is not for the weak palate. If you are just getting into craft beer I'm not sure that this would be something good to jump into, but any hop lover would adore this I am sure. Great beer.

Smelled and tasted the same: like hops. Very fruity and citrusy hops. A caramel malt sweetness bobbed its head up and down every so often like a man tossed overboard into a sea of hops. Finish had more hop bitterness. Not a bad one if you're in the mood for a hop bomb, but way out of balance. I can tell that the malts would be flavorful if not completely overpowered by the hops. Still I enjoyed it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,markskar,4.97,"Man, I love the Arrogant One. Been drinking it for a long time, but haven't felt inspired to review until tonight.  A: Deep copper, somewhat dark but clear. Nice lacing, little head.  Smell: Wonderfully hoppy, hints of cantelope, honeydew, and oranges. I could huff this all night and be happy (though I think I'll drink it too).  Taste: Again, gotta stick with the melon theme in the flavor as well as the aroma. Couldn't put my finger on the taste until tonight, but I think it's best compared to honeydew melons. Perhaps the most delicious and well-balanced hoppy brew you will find in an American Beer (though Bigfoot could be my preference on another evening). The malty sweetness is there, but all I taste is sweet delicious melons.  M: Dry at first, but goes down smooth and sticky. Aromatic hoppy bitterness lingers, but in a lucsious, viscous way that isn't overbearing (despite the ""Arrogant"" self-proclamation). If overbearing is what you're looking for in a hop experience, go for Stone's Ruination--that's what it's made for!  D: One in a Billion in terms of drinkability. Every sip is a feast for the palate, and every sip is better than the last. I don't know of any other beer that I would say this for, even among my other favorites.  Am I Worthy?

Tremendously challenging and way far to complex for me to be able to pull out every aspect of this beer. At first, you'll find it very unbalanced. and at the end, you'll find it very... unbalanced! Toffee and caramel smell will come up at first but flooded with floral hops, malt, molases, even nuts and earth. Bitter chocolate (I'm i dreaming or what).

Holy cow, that's a lot of lacing.  S - Wet dog comes and slaps me in the face, but persistent sniffing yields toffee, caramel, and bitter cocoa. It's also got that malty sweet aroma i detected in HopSlam that's reminiscent of pink amoxicillin liquid. Yum.  T - A strong hoppy kick yielding medium bitterness when cold and a very malty sweetness as it gets warmer. Lots of complexity here: nuts, grain, hoppy resin, raisins, molasses...damn, it's like the beer's challenging me to find the flavors. Gets even better as it warms, giving off a yummy brown sugar taste.  M - Smooth with a medium-light body. Low carbonation, fels appropriate for this beer; definitely not 'fizzy yellow'. It's also fairly warming.  D - I don't get any alcohol burn, so it's really drinkable, the bitterness the only thing holding it back.

147,92,bsend,4.23,"Poured this 22 oz. bomber into a nice mug.  The beer pours a rich mahogany color. It provides a little amount of light to go through. The beer poured a nice 2 finger mocha, brown colored head that stayed with most of the brew.  The smell wasn't overly strong. I received a mix of dry fruit, some brown sugar, and a slight amounts of toffee.  The taste was top notch. It started out with an intense alcohol flavor that moved over into a more mellow sweetness and malt.  The mouth feel was excellent. I really like the smooth texture and light carbonation. It let me really move this around the mouth to experience the wonderful, vast amount of flavors.  The drinkability is definitely there. Wih an ABV of 7.2%, it can really knock you on your butt, but the mellowness of flavor helps to keep them going down right.  Final Thoughts - I love Stone Brewing Company and this was my first introduction to them a while back. Between the complex flavor and smooth drinkability, this ale solidifies it as my number one American Strong Ale. You have to pick up a 22 oz. bomber of this to truly appreciate American Craft brewing. Highly recommended!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

S - smells of hops, and i smell a bit of alcohol.  T - Strong hoppy flavor at the beginning, then smooths out a little. The beer finished with a heavy, slap-in-the-face bitterness, as well as a strong alcohol flavor. That alcohol really stays on my tongue and cheeks.  M- thinner than average body, as well as carbonation, I don't mind it.  D - This beer is drinkable, although if you made it through two of these, you'd probably want to get in a fight.

Taste: Piney hop bitterness. Slight citrus qualities and a very faint smokiness as well. A great bitter, spicy finish. Hides the ABV well.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, refreshing carbonation.

147,92,cmaloy,4.87,The best way to explain this beer is to say that it punches you in the face after you drink it. The hoppy bite in the aftertaste is strong and I really enjoyed the long lasting taste this beer left in my mouth.  The appearance was dark brown and maintained a foamy head on top.  You could smell the perfect blend of malt and taste the bitterness of the hops on the finish. When first drinking this beer you start off with a kind of creamy thickness and end with a bitterness you would expect in a strong beer. You can also taste the alcohol in the after taste.  I would recommend drinking this beer with red meat. Actually I would recommend drinking this beer period.

147,92,jburns4,4.08,"22 oz. bottle  This is my first beer review, so I'm not really sure of the protocol on how these typically go, but I felt compelled to write one after having this hell of a brew. First off, I love the way this beer is pitched. It doesn't challenge you, it just disregards you.  The appearance is a nice dark brown with an off-white head that laces nicely.  The smell is underwhelming, although not displeasing.  Mouth feel is good, pleasantly viscous but not too thick. Goes down smooth.  Taste is bipolar. Starts off with a nice malt and changes quickly to a sharp bitter. Very nice balance though.  Overall great beer. I think I could drink a maximum of two bottles in one night, but am perfectly content with one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,beeroclock,4.55,"I finally had an opportunity to try this beer and the wait was worth it. I have never given a beer a 5 in any category and here it is....  Poured into a pint glass, deep amber/reddish, nice head that clung to the glass very well. Smelled of some caramel and toasted malt. Tasted the same but OMG, how nicely it was put together. Definitely not overboard, in fact the sweet is not really there, just enough to lure you in and give you the strong malt kick. Tasted most excellent! Mouthfeel and drinkability both were top notch. In fact, I can't really think of much else they could do to make it better, but I am very cautious of giving out 5's. This is the first in all of my years rating. Arrogant Bastard truly does stand out. I can't wait to get another!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,kels,3.79,"Split a bomber of this with bamadog last night. This is my first experience with AB, and he tells me he thinks the bomber was a little old (no date on bottle). I still liked it a lot, but good to mention just in case this review seems way off.  Appearance: Pours deep reddish-brown with a short, fluffy tan head that fades immediately to a skim. The liquid is clear with light carbonation running throughout, and traces of light, sticky lacing remain.  Smell: Very hardly detectable - only the lightest chewy maltiness comes through.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Very sweet, caramelly malts dominate the front end of this brew, followed by sticky, not-too-bitter citrusy hops . The bright, effervescent mouthfeel contributes to the smoothness of the feel, and the aftertaste is slightly bitter and quite sticky.  Drinkability: Really high. There's a nice balance of the flavors going, and it's not nearly as intimidating as the bottle suggests. Perhaps it has mellowed with age.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,brewdoc75,4.26,"Served from a bomber into a Duvel tulip. Best by date: 4/21/09  A: Blood red to maroon. Beautiful reddish hues come off the glass. Could this be the blood of the gargoyle on the label? A crisp white head crowns the top. As it falls, a lovely lace kisses the edge of the glass. Carbonation is just right and not over lively.  S: Grapefruit hops backed up by a bevy of sweet malty aromas. Definite esters as the fruity aromas permeate. There is a hint of caramel as well. Not overly aromatic however.  T: Malty onslaught at first. Fruitiness is prevalent in the flavors. The fruits I get are plums and a slight hint of cherry. This reminds me of an old ale in its fruity/malty complexity. The malts are further asserted with strong caramel and a hint of toffee. I didn't really get a roasted flavor like others did initially, however as I drink up it definitely comes out. This is all quickly followed up with a solid hoppy bite. There is excellent balancing bitterness. It lingers for a while after the drink, punishing your tastebuds for even thinking about a lesser beer. The flavors blend well and the complexity is nice.  M: Medium bodied. A little on the syrupy side. The bitterness definitely drys out the palate.  D: This is a damned good beer. Now I know why it is so celebrated by beer geeks like myself. It was definitely a beer I'd try again, but I don't think I'd have more than one in a sitting. It is a great beer to have as a nightcap, but not for a hot day at the lake.

For me the aroma doesn't stand out a lot but whats there is definitely nice. The taste is wonderful. Pretty well balanced and not extremely hoppy. It's bitter but has some sweetness to it that I really like. The mouthfeel is good, it's nowhere near thin but it's not really thick making it at a nice place right in the middle. This beer is very drinkable. Not a high ABV and the taste is awesome.

S - bitter grapefruit hits the nose first, but it is quickly backed up some malt sweetness, very clean, very simple, but also very good.  T - flavour closely follows the aroma, but with more depth and fullness. More breadiness from the malt, juicy, firm bitterness from the hops. Finish is long, piney bitterness lingers.  M - medium body, could possibly be a touch fuller, though it would take away from the drinkability, resinous, dry finish, medium carbonation, almost zero alcohol presence  D - right up my alley, robust flavours, well put together, easy to drink  Based on the colour and other folks thoughts, I was expecting more malt sweetness and toffee flavour, but this still has quite a lean and mean malt profile. The hops are assertive, particularly in the finish, but still blend together well with the rest of the beer. Agressive and simple, but perfectly executed.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

A surface cap and a fresh blast of hops accessible with a little spin.  Alcohol is notable on the nose initially, until it can breathe a bit. Some sweetish malts and citrus hops as well. More earthy on the hop nose later on particularly after a bit of a swirl. Quite enticing after a little warming with chocolaty hops abundant.  Bready malts on the tongue, touch of fig and chocolate. Nice rich body without being cloying on the sweetness. ABV is well hidden after a bit of air and warming, well balanced yielding a good drinkability.

Dark red/brown.  S - Very good. Truth be told, I prefer Cascade to Centennial (blasphemy, some will say), but Arrogant bastard is still a benchmark in this regard.  T - Again, very good. Hops mingle with the high-lovibond Crystal quite nicely. Whoever decided upon this combination should get a medal (if they haven't already). American strong ales are vying for my favorite style.  M - Another very good mark. If I had to nit pick, I might say perhaps a little too thick/slick, but that's just nitpicking. Carbonation about right.  D - Good to excellent, depending upon my mood.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

This beer looks very inviting!  My first whip is all hops, however, very subtle. In fact, the smell is not what I expected or what I would expect from a strong ale.  This beer is thick - almost syrup like, and as promised it is very aggressive. It has a slight toasted coffee flavor and the hops hits you like a freight-train. The malt sneaks in at the very end for a lingering aftertaste.  This beer is a mouthful - thick and rich.

This beer got better as it warmed, the hops came out and the flavors balanced a bit. The alcohol was evidenced in the finish at times, but was overall basically hidden.  Overall, good beer, but if you can get the oaked over this one I would recommend the oaked first. IMO, I would recommend letting it warm a touch as well.

T - damn, thats how a beer should taste! this has been one of my favorites for a long time, and reviewing it with all care and attention I can really remember why. the foreground is a grainy taste, with some pinch of the hops. a small swallow allows an explosion of hops bursting all over, allowing a full complement to the malts and other grains used. the malts come out slightly more and in a light sweetness during the finish, the hops also at first pack a big punch, then they subside and let the residual sweetness reign in. the aftertaste is distinctively bitter with some graininess but not as much as the other parts of the drinking.

A - ruby red color with 2cm of head. the head was pretty stiff and stuck around for quite a while.  S - caramel malt, fruity doppelbock like smell (cranberries, apples, cherries), hops (slight citrus, lots of pine resin)  T - starts out with notes of caramel malt and a slightly sweet honey-like taste, then the hops take over, building in intensity until the beer just disintegrates into bitterness. at first, they're citrusy/floral, then there's lots of pine and finally the bitterness. the beer still didn't seem that unbalanced (granted, it wasn't balanced, but my wording implies that the beer was hop heavy.) honestly, considering the overall maltiness of this beer combined with a fruityness and a lot of hops, it seems to me to be an American Barleywine, and it's a hell of a lot better than Old Guardian. the alcohol wasn't noticeable.

There is some type of too-sweet ingredient that I find out of place in this beer. Other reviewers have stated that they detect citrus flavors. Well, I cannot taste them.

147,92,LiquorLockerVP,4.27,"Pouring this one tonight for some friends, wanted to get familiar.  Appearance: A red hued honey amber. Very tiny bits of gas bubbling below the surface. The head was a medium packed morange of slightly, slightly, orange cream color. The head retreats to the sides of the glass, leaving some whipped looking islands.  Smell: I want to say a mix of toffee and pineapple. When I get my snout further into the glass, and go beyond the exploratory sniff, the citrus notes slide away to reveal the hot pins of alcohol. It is a pleasant transformation of aromas.  Taste: Sweet, not really what I expected but very enjoyable. The grapefruit/pineapple is definetly there, with less malt than I had thought. The toffee nose is misleading. I expected a fatter a malt assault, but didn't get too much. After the sweetness, the tide of bitters came washing in to scourge the palate. It conveyed an overall refreshing taste, as opposed to the big belly weigh down I thought it would be.  Moutful: Mild amount of carbonation, feels like more because of the hops. Has a nice sharp moutful and a good clean up. The sweet comes in, fizzes a bit, then is broomed up by bitters. The hops do linger a bit on the tongue though after a good scrubbing.  Drinkability: Really nice, not the belly bomb I thought it would be. I could see it being a great food beer, but also would be a good ""on the deck after mowing the lawn"" beverage.

147,92,HeroJH,3.25,"I like the smell much more than the taste of this one. I see that Stone is going for Arrogant bitterness on this one, and that's fine to me. Personally, I like a little more complexity. I can see liking this beer, and I'd order it on tap depending on what else I saw but I don't think I'd buy it to take home. Though maybe I'd try it again because I seem to remember it having more flavor the other times I've tried it... hmm. It has a threat on the bottle that says if you don't like it, this beer wasn't made for you. Which is neat. But I feel that more people would grade this higher just to fit in. Taking an honest look at that flavor this beer shouldn't get an A in the taste category, especially when comparing it to others that have full complex amazing flavor.  A - Copper Red, hazy at first when it was too cold and then cleared up. Tan head, good foam, lacing and retention. I like it.  S - Really nice, seems to be a few things going on there. Nuts, peanut brittle!, dark caramel. Nice hops throughout.  T - Here's where it went downhill for me. I wish that it tasted as good as it smelled and looked. It's so bitter that if I didn't let it warm it up and really concentrated I wasn't getting anything else. But there is at the end some toastyness, a hint of oaky. And I supposed the bitterness could contain some pineapple acidity. But overall, the complexity is nothing near the smell, which is usual, but there was a big difference to me on this one. It was mostly just bitter without even hop flavor.  M - just bitter.  D - too bitter without anything else to keep my interest. Trust me I like bitter, but I like a little more fullness in the hop profile if it's going to try to blow me away.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,GimmeAles,4.25,"Iridescent mahogany slips into the snifter with a healthy beige head which leave some great lace.  The nose is a big hit of evergreen resins, citrus, orange candy, and a whiff of toffee sweetness.  Flavor delivers massive hop bitterness up front, which hits with juicy grapefruit, orange pith and aspirin. Toffee-like crystal malts jump into the fray giving some sweetness and dark rye chewiness. However, the hops quickly shove themselves back into the dance and lay down a final slap of macerated pine needles which lingers.  Moderately viscous in the mouth, but the bitterness dries this out nicely. Quaffable except for the fact that it's over 7 percent abv.  A classic - an icon, and still a solid, well-conditioned hit of hoppy goodness.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,liquidnoise,3.4,"Considering Stone's IPA is currently my favorite brew, I wouldn't call myself a fizzy yellow beer drinker.  That said, what the hell is with this beer? Drinking this beer was like drinking a bunch of hops that were thrown in a juicer and this is what came out.  This definately wasn't my cup of tea. It's so strong it's going to kick you on your ass like the arrogant bastard it is, so do you want to spend your hard earned money on something that will behave in such ways? (especially when Stone is brewing stuff like Stone IPA)  Worth a try to laugh at the audacity. Pick up a bottle of Stone's IPA while your at it so after you spit this out, you have some backup.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Brewnami,4.37,"No sense in going over what this beer looks like as 1,600 people already have. If you're not familiar with Stone Brewery, familiarize yourself as I have yet to dislike or think any of their brews are less than awesome. This particular beer tastes like a darker, heavier version of their amazing IPA. Almost like a brown ale meets an IPA. Pretty high alcohol content, which I really like. 7.2% that is masked very well with an amazing hoppy and malty flavor. Also a very affordable beer- I paid $4.99 for a 22oz. at Bauer's on Newbury St. in Boston. Recommended for fans of IPA's, Brown Ales, anyone with hair on their chest, etc. Buy one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,erikm25,4.35,"A: Pours a dark caramel with mahogany and amber hues. Some really nice crimson highlights throughout. The head is tightly bubbled leaving a fluffy and creamy top. Retention is very strong. Lacing sticks to the glass like a shadow.  S: Bread stuffed with caramel and cherry candied fruits. There are some hints of hops and lemon citrus (the former which is to be expected with Stone). Rounded out with sweet flowers and honey syrup. The nose is a good prelude to the complexity of the taste.  T: Lots of stuff happening here. Massive malt sweetness that is rounded out with an earthy oakness. Dash of vanilla, citrus, and spice. Can't forget the dripping amounts pine hops. Toffee dipped in pineapple juice. Breaded and licoriced. Personally, I love the bitter finish. Alcohol is above 7% so depending on how you are drinking this it can sneak up fast.  M: Medium to full bodied. This was sticking all over my mouth with some distorting carbonation. Leaves the mouth a little numb which makes it great with some bold food.  D: While I had craft beers before AB was the one that pushed me over into the realm. I found a case today and figured it was about time I gave this one a formal review. Jammed the new 16 album Bridges to Burn and enjoyed life. This is highly recommended.

Starts off with those smooth flavors and then has a nice medium hop finish. Ever so slight alcohol on the end. Mouthfeel is nice as the beer wonders its way down. Great drinkability for this beer since I think I could easily knock out a few bombers if available.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

S- Big graham, caramel, honey, citrus hops, chocolate, roasted grains, great hoppy edge.  T- Big molasses, clove, honey, big piny hops, pineapple. Finish is thick with great dry hopiness backing up the massive caramel malt.  M- Thick feel, very bold mouthfeel.  D- This is an excellent beer.

147,92,patobandito,4.21,"Ive had the oaked version may times, but I never could find just the normal old Arrogant Bastard. (I live in beer hell) Glad I finally found it.  Pours a dark caramel color with a thick foamy head that lingers. Great lacing. Smells of hops with a floral note, as well as a caramel malt. At first taste, the hops are slightly overwhelming, but the malt gradually balances it out as it warms. It has a great mouthfull, and is very drinkable if you can stand the hops.  Overall, I prefer the oaked version, but its a bit too expensive for my wallet, so this is a happy substitute. Great Beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Wetpaperbag,4.2,"A- Darker brown in color, almost like a dark dark caramel.  S- Great hoppy grapefruity smell, very well balanced smell.  T- The hop taste is good, yet very balanced with a caramel malt taste. This is just a phenomenal beer. Great standby. I remember when I was first started drinking craft beer the hop taste was very overpowering, yet now it is just right.  M- Easy feeling in the mouth, not too anything, just the right amount.  D- Very easy to drink.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Very pleasing to the palate.  mouthfeel: very smooth and enjoyable  drinkability: it's powerful, but it goes down very easy. I find it ironic that the bottle advertises that it's too bold or aggressive compared to macrobrews because this goes down much easier than the cheap stuff.  I was expecting something a little more powerful, something along the lines of a belgian strong ale, and this definitely surprised me. I kind of thought it was just an extra malty IPA, but about halfway through the bomber the rich and complex flavors really came through. My only regrets are that it would be pricy to drink this stuff on a regular basis :3",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,cpn920,4,Pours a copper hazy color with a billowing head that dissipates quickly and falls to a thin covering. Brew leaves a decent amount of lacing. Smell a rich malt aroma with a nice dose of hops. Nice tasting beer with a malt sweetness that finishes with a nice bitter hop taste that lingers. Definitely a full bodied beer with good carbonation.

147,92,Duhast500,3.85,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass  The color is a deep red almost a maroon color with a foamy white, brownish head.  The smell is of oats, strong and bitter, hard to place but the outgoing main aroma.  The taste is bitter, strong bitterness taste the first taste buds and throws them for a wallop. The hops in the background sit on the already busy tongue till it bring about tastes that were never expected from a beer such as this.  The real puzzle that is Arrogant Bastard is the taste. It is hard by sweet at the same time. Hard going down but sweet till the last drop.

147,92,Pedro07,4.03,"Haven't had this one for a long time, so I picked up a cheap bottle at the local.  A- Pours a nice deep, rusty amber hue, producing a 1+ finger light tan/white head. Falls, but gives nice lacing.  S- I get some modest hops here. I can tell this one will be flavorfull. While the smell is lighter, I get the full range, oily-hops oders, a lot of earthiness and pine-notes, even a little citrus.  T- Oooh yes, I get hops. A nice surprise I did not remember is how balanced this guy is. I can get some sweet malt on the initial taste. It's very balanced. With the taste, I don't get any citrus in the hop. Rather, there is grassiness, earthiness, and some pine. A nice change from a floral, citrus bombs I've had lately.  M- This guy is good. It has a little weightiness on the palate which is nice. Plenty of carbonation to boot.  D- This is where this guy shines. Full flavor, great mini-session beer. Feel free to pull a couple back and enjoy.  This beer is a great value.

Taste: Hop bitterness starting out, hints of grapefruit. Bitterness is balanced out by some sweet maltiness. I taste vanilla and gingerbread flavors in the malts. Then, more hops, bitter like black licorice.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth, yet kinda dry.  Drinkability: Very hoppy, but balanced. A very good beer.  Overall: This stuff is really good.

A: It poured a very deep red or mohagany.  S: Lots of malty sweetness, and a bit of hops with something sweet  T: I quickly figured out the sweetness I couldn't pinpoint. It seemed to me to be some vanilla. I read some others and nobody else seemed to get this. But I did, also, there was a touch of hops, and of course malty goodness. Not nealry the hops I had expected.  M: Smooth as silk!  D: I could drink a bunch of these but the price held me back which is fine with me.

Hazy bronze pour beneath a one-finger head that fades slowly leaving a solid cap and heavy, clinging lace all the way down. Great looking brew. Nose dominated by grapefruit-citrus hops with some malt sweetness. Balances out a bit as it warms. No real alcohol scent. In the mouth, this one is all about the citrus hops, with pink grapefruit barely balanced against a malt backbone. Oddly tasty sugary-bitter finish, finally with hints of the 7.2% ABV. Mouth is semi-viscous with low yet present carbonation keeping things smooth yet crisp. Drinkability is very good; it's great tasting but obviously packs a punch. I could probably only manage a couple of these.  Overall: I was quite pleased with my first experience with Arrogant Bastard Ale. Is it a bit over hyped?

Big and tight cream head has excellent retention and leaves a heavy lace.  S: Heavy on the citrus with grapefruit and lemon. As the nose lingers, the aromas of molasses and dark fruits sneak through.  T: Citrus hops dominate out of the gate. Grapefruit and lemon aromas carry through to the flavor. Malt comes on with a thick layer of molasses and burnt oak. Finishes tart and dry. Alcohol adds a touch of warmth going down.

Dry and packs a wallop entering the mouth, bitters, orange peel, roasted grains, verges on grassy at moments. Raisins, cherry pits, peach fuzz, the fruit is there but sneaky. It's undeniably complex and feels like it would taste different bottle to bottle. Not a beer you can drink while out gossiping with the girls.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

S: Sharp citric and floral hops, with considerable toasted grain sweetness. Loads of fruity esters and definitely some alcohol to boot.  T: Toasty caramel malt sweetness is accompanied by big floral and orange/grapefruit hop flavors. Starts off slightly sweet and more citric, but a long, riding floral bitterness takes hold. Some faint herbal notes and again, fleeting fruitiness here and there. A rough, lingering, alcoholic bitterness rides into the aftertaste. I get a bit of coffee and grain lurking around as well.  M: Medium-full in body, with light carbonation. A creamy, smooth mouthfeel with a big drying bitter finish. An oily, resiny character is well.  D: Well, as expected, this is one aggressive beer. Obviously the hops run away with this one, but there's actually a very sturdy malt backbone, which is something that many beers like this seem to miss.

Hard pour produced barely a 1-fingered head that is light tan in color, thick & creamy, and settled to a thin film on top. It did disappear quickly, though, but left strings of lace behind. Quite the ominous-looking ale!  A: Freshly-baked, toasted wheat bread type of malt, creamy caramel, citrusy hops, some wood, smoke, and alochol. Damn, this is definitely intriguing.  T: Flavor definitely stands up to the nose. I was afraid that the flavor wouldn't be as interesting as the aroma is, but I'm glad to see otherwise. Thick, toasted, bready malt covered in creamy caramel & a kiss of chocolate, wrapped in slightly woody smoke, backed by a citrusy hop attack full of grapefruity flavors that pretty much stay under the malts while still making their presence well-known. That beautiful flowers' flavor profile is considerably more pronounced in the dry finish along with alcohol. Nice warming effect in the chest!  M: Full-bodied, creamy & rich, viscious yet smooth. Perfectly carbonated for a subtle ""bite"" on the tongue.  D: Are you sure that this is only 7.2% ABV? Wow, this is kicking my ass! Don't know about anymore than 2 of these in one night.  Notes: Yet another winner from the geniuses at Stone Brewing. The signature beer in a series of brews that all possess that same bold, in-your-face type of full flavor that one has come to expect.

147,92,fingerlaker,4.57,"Quite good.  First off, if you don't like bitter beers, stop reading now. Do not try it. It's quite bitter; not IPA or barleywine levels but it's there.  The pint my barkeep handed me had a big head with large bubbles. It's a deep crimson red with little sediment floating through it unlike a porter.  The smell is world-class. The hops are so floral, it was like walking through a field. I didn't notice fruit like some others did.  From the first tiny sip the Bastard will command your tastebuds. It takes control and you're just along for the ride. There are SO many flavors from this four-ingredient beer, where do I start? Big roasted notes. Raisins. Tons of bittering hops. A wee beef(!) note.  The beer turns your tongue into a mosh pit, waking up every tastebud with a M-80.  Drinkability... It can get a bit grating after a while. Arrogant Bastard is like big fat friend you have that is fun to be around because he's low brow and unpolished simpleton. He's funny at first, but after a few hours you're left with a farting, belching, swearing heap that checks out your girlfriend's breasts a little bit too much. It was similar with the Bastard, the demanding flavor got too extreme after a while, making me wish for something lighter.  In all, I enjoyed my experience with the Bastard.  P.S.

147,92,Bootscraper,4.39,"I have heard so much about this infamous beer, and even had the privilege of sampling some a while back. Reminded me of a stout and IPA hybrid... I thought it was tasty enough for me to go pick one up for myself to review. Served a hair over 50 degrees F in Pint Glass, listening to Genghis Tron's ""Dead Mountain Mouth"". Let's just say that my mouth is not dead after this hell of a beer. The pour produced a full 1cm light tan creamy head. It shrank to just a very very thin (almost non-existent) layer after just a few lengthy minutes, but it stayed until the bottom of my glass. The lacing was patchy but there was a good amount of it, and a bit of it stuck around for a very long time. The smell is mellow, but pure hops that are slightly sharp (almost pine-y). It's also pretty ""warm"" too, in other words, either roasted or Dark fruit scents were accompanying all those hops. There may also be some flowery characteristics of a typical ale that were trying to be known in my nose. The taste, also, is translated simply as ""hops"". Now it is at the tongue , yes, they definitely are roasted. Not too much though, like, say, a stout. There may also be some semi-sweet caramel nuances in here, but if so, it just blends with the roasted/smoked flavors. It is a little alcoholic, but that is typical of a strong ale (duh), and the flavor is very consistent from sip to finish. What wins me over though, is the epic aftertaste. It doesn't matter if I already put my glass down and started writing some more notes, I am still drinking this thing. One sip, and you are tasting those hops for a good 10 minutes. In the mouth, that flavor is made amazing by the fact that this a full-bodied beer. And hey, it's also very smooth, and a just little bit sticky. Great carbonation levels as well. Love it! I like how personal the huge ass bottle is as far as drinkability goes, but I can see how it could be intimidating to some. Thankfully, they sell this in smaller 6 packs now. Not much else I can say about this beer... just a very straight-forward design executed with great brilliance and attention to detail.

Outstanding Sticky lacing for the duration.(Over 1 Hour) That being said, I did not drink this brew very quickly as it was indeed quite strong. The smell was good... hops mostly. It is a fairly complex beer in taste but the hops clearly dominate here. I will have to try again to pick up on those complexities.

Interesting aroma - Citrus, earthy, caramel, toast....overall gentle on the nose...but what a surprise thereafter! Taste is predominant bitter and woody, some spice. Bitter is not in a pale ale or IPA sort of way, and much more aggressive than smooth. Palate is moderatley thick and syrupy residue that lingers a good while. Depth and complexity that leaves you guessing and wanting more...and I will definitely need more in order to put my finger on it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

This beer is big on the malts and big on the hops. Love the balance between the sweet caramel and toffee goodness coupled with pine and hops makes this quite tasty. Great finish, medium bodied.

Appearance is reddish oak with an ivory head.  Smell is very aggressive and enticing; it's pretty much taunting at you to try it and not be a wuss.  The taste reminds one of a pure IPA; it gives the tastebuds a good kick in the ass with its strong citrusy and hoppy notes.  Mouthfeel is the same way, although it goes down smoothly.

147,92,Jmoore50,4.85,"Just to start off this is maybe one of my favorite beers of all time. I just love everything about this beer. The first time I had this brew was about two years ago and it kicked me in the face and I instantly got hard. I love the brew and I love Stone Brewery for making this brew.  The bottle has the arrogant bastard gargoyle with a pint of brew. Basically this beer tells you how it is, if you don't like beer or drink yellow fizzy crap then don't even bother buying Arrogant Bastard. I will have to agree, if you don't like Arrogant Bastard you should probably start drinking chocolate milk again because your a little boy.  The appearance is a dark red. An almost bloody brew that pours with a two finger head that quickly disappears. No real lacing that is noticeable, but just a faint spot here and there.  The smell is that of oak, alcohol, hops, and goodness. Which goes along very well with the flavor. It just yells hops and alcohol. I get this real warm flavor that is probably the hops with the alcohol. I just love the way it tastes and the overall mouthfeel. It tastes really good and goes down smooth.  I could drink a few pints of these. I will start buying them more often. BUY AND DRINK THIS BREW!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,gabe23,4.35,"A - Deep amber color with a nice creamy head. Lacing looks great and occurs all the way to the bottom of the glass.  S - Hoppy aroma with some fruity sweetness deep in the background. Some alcohol, but it blends nicely.  T - Starts sweet but citrusy hops hit you quickly. The hops flavor seems to cling to the inside of your mouth until the next drink. It's fairly dry with a nice, green aftertaste.  M - Full and substantial, but still goes down smooth.  D - I could easily put away a few pints of this fine beer. I'm not really a hophead, but this one has just the right balance that ensures the hop profile doesn't completely dominate. Arrogant Bastard is a regular fixture in my fridge.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,melagnus,4.97,"A - Pours a deep copper color with a nice foamy head. Head retention is spot-on and leaves a wonderful residue (no lacing though) on the side of the glass as it recedes.  S - Instant smell of hops (Cascadian?) Balanced well in aroma with a malty smell at the end. Hops seem to dominate, though nothing out of style.  T - A very smooth taste across the palate with a bitter finish from the hops. Malts hit your tongue in the center of the palate to wash over with a bitter finish. Creaminess completely covering the tongue with a long subdue on the second swallow. Balance strikes me as more balanced than was the case upon first sample. Third sample exposes itself to a malty finish, though quickly subsides to expose the more aggressive hoppy-side.  M - Taste is similar to the smell, though more hoppy aromas are prevalent in the smell than in the taste. Very smooth, properly carbonated and well-balanced!  D - Extremely drinkable and a beer I could easily drink into the wee-hours of the night.  Definitely a highly recommended beer and by far one of my favorites. I'm enjoying it so much I wish I didn't use some it for my brussel sprout recipe!  Enjoy!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,babaracas,4.32,"Pours a clear dark red with orangish edges, billowing cream colored head, meringue-like one finger chunk sticks around forever, thick sheet of lace all the way down. Smell: pine needles, floral, pink grapefruit, caramel, hints of cherry and plum. Taste: grapefruit, citrus rind, caramel, some leafy raw edges, roasted with a hint of dark chocolate. Given the finish, I'd swear there were oats involved. Even with all of the other amped ASAs out there, AB is still the king... brash, abrasive, but well rounded.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,SerieDNo3,4.33,"22 oz. bomber poured into a mug  A: Pours a very deep ruby. Despite being clear, it is very dark, and hard for light to penetrate. About a finger and a half of a fluffy, reddish-tan head. Decent head retention, and lots of lacing.  S: A lot of hops on the nose, as well as some dark fruit and caramel.  T: Varying hop flavors competing with some caramel, toffee, and a lot of pineapple. The pineapple flavors are very evident as the beer warms up.  M: The carbonation level is about right. The beer feels a bit oily and slick, with a little bit of a tingle on the back of the throat as it goes down.  D: It may not be as beautiful or complex as its seasonal bigger brother, but it's much more balanced. I've had nights wherein I put down several pints of this like water (only to feel the effects later). It's scarily drinkable. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden, so what remains is a wonderfully tasty beer that begs to be drunk again and again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I love the way this beer looks. S- Aggresive hop odor, very aggresive hop odor. Everytime I drink this beer, and I drink it often, I forget how hoppy it is and it always brings a smile to my face. T- WOW!! So stong and hoppy. I get a piny after taste with a bite in the back of my mouth. Yum! M- Once its in your mouth you know its a stong ale and you can definatly tell the ABV.

I recomend it to anyone who mentions they like a hoppy beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Grathan,3.83,"This beer is mainly about hops. Strong flavours of cascades type flavor reminiscent of Sierra Nevada's pale ale with plenty of bitterness to boot.

You probably won't like it.""",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,talkinghatrack,4.39,"Clearly this beer doesn't hide its intentions. So even if it isn't perfect for your tastes, you know what you're getting into.  Nice pour head retains a little foam mound after settling. The aroma is great - solid hits of freshly cut fruit (apricot?). Each sip is its own little rollercoaster. It starts with the fruity smell as you raise the glass to your nose, then you get the medium bodied mouthfeel. Next is the sweet fruit that gives way to a bitter kick that appears and mellows after each swallow. I'm not a big bitters fan but I find this one tolerable and I know it's by design. The whole package of taste and smell easily masks its 7.2% alcohol content and keeps it highly drinkable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jpaltan,4.33,"A muddy brown, quite opaque hints of copper around the edges. Head pours thick and off-white and damn does it stay. Tons of lacing around the glass. Smell is malty with essence of grapefruit and pine. More grapefruit than anything though. This is an aggressively hopped beer, though more mellow than I remember. Perhaps, the bottle is a bit on the older side. Hops come forward first, with a piney taste. A malty sweetness persists in the middle that gives way to a strong bitterness. Not quite astringent, but the alcohol is definitely there. Mouthfeel is just about perfect for this beer. Well carbonated to carry the hops and booze off the tongue. The beer is quite coating though and does seem to stick to the tongue.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Smells sweet, you can pick up the malts right away. At the same time, the hops are definitely noticeable too, great balance.  On taste its slightly bitter, with some citrus notes added. Good roasted malt also. Seems to be medium bodied and overall the perfect balance. I really enjoyed drinking this.  The 7.2 abv is hidden very well, could drink many of these. Don't let it sneak up on you though, as I picked up a hint of the alcohol near the end.  Awesome brew, highly recommend it!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,macster,4.35,"This is simply one superb ale. Pours a beautiful burgundy-amber color under a durable, wispy off-white head. Aroma is initially dominated by the sweet malt profile. Lots of roasted malts, caramel and wheat toast notes are up front supported by a background of citrus-pine needle hop aromas. Mouthfeel is just perfect; smooth, chewy and round. Flavors in turn are definitely all about the hops here, but the sweetness of the malts balance things out very nicely. Starts out with somewhat semi-sweet dark wheat bread, smokey, fig flavor, but quickly transcends into a big, crisp and bitter hoppy long finish. It reminded me a lot of Bigfoot without the big alcohol kick and with a touch more malt.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,scootny,4.15,A clear deep garnet red/brown. One finger head little evident carbonation. Good lacing.  Piney hops and light caramel malt as well. A big floral and complex bouquet.  Hops hit first with force. Malt tries to balance it out initially but it is a losing battle. As it warms the balance evens out. A nice malty core checks the effusive hop blend. Strong hops are like Sierra Nevada Celebration on steroids. Finish is complex and hoppy with roasty malt.  Mouthfeel is and the slightly lighter side of medium. Good carbonation level as it scrubs the tongue in a long drying finish.  Excellent drinkability. Alcohol is nowhere to be found until you finish the glass.

Slight hint of malt as well.  T - Sweet citrus notes, predominately grapefruit. Sweeter than one may expect. Very hoppy as well. Finishes with a slightly bitter aftertaste, but for a hoppy beer it's nicely balanced.  M - Medium body and carbonation.  D - Surprisingly well-balanced and highly drinkable for such a hoppy beer.

147,92,ncstateplaya,4.19,"Appearance: Upon initial inspection I was like, damn that is brown!!! Actually, this bastard poured a cloudy orange hued amber when held up to the light. The off-white head was fizzy and quickly receeded, leaving a sheet of head and subtle lacing.  Smell: The malts are extremely sweet, date like almost. There is a nice hoppy aroma that lends citrusy fruit zest to the nose. I also picked up hints of vanilla that was very welcoming.  Taste: This brew was very hoppy, more so than I was expecting going on smell alone. The hoppy bitterness is the underlying characteristic, and a nice malty backbone smoothes everything over. There is also a satisfying bite of alcohol on the finish.  Mouthfeel: It is full of carbonation, keeping the tastebuds honest I say. AB is definitely crisp and has a drying bitter finish, but it goes down oh so smooth.  Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. It is extremely well crafted with no quality being overwhelming.

Retention is very good and lacing is slightly impressive.  Nice, big caramely malt notes. Citrus hops notes, mostly grapefruit. Very bready. For such a 'big' beer, I expected a bigger nose.  Starts with a kiss of sweet caramel and brown sugar on top of some dark fruits. Just before you can get into that, though, it blasts you with the bitter bite of big citrusy hops. Needs to be a touch more balanced. The hops overpower everything else.  Good body. It's at the higher end of medium, on the scale. Almost gets into full-bodied, but not quite.  It's very good, but could be so much better with more balance. Not my favorite from Stone, although it is their flagship brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Notes of caramel and citrus in abundance, I took a minute to put on my wonder woman underoos at this point, and continued with caution. This is a big beer.

I'm always searching for something I haven't tried yet that will leave my mouth tingling from bitterness. Once I saw this brew said ""You're not worthy"" I knew I had to try. It poured almost a brown which was cloudy with bubbles rising from the depths instantly. I chilled it to a near freezing temperature because I love cold brew, this might have made it more stronger tasting but I loved it. I can barely describe the taste because it changes so much so fast. After a swallow an immediate hoppy bitterness congregated on my palate. A fantastic beer! And still as my pilsner glass sits it is covered from top to bottom in the thickest lacing I've ever seen.

I've heard so many good thing about Stone Brewery so I thought I'd do some prep work prior to our trip. I picket up a 22oz bottle of Arrogant Bastard on my latest trip to the beer store.  A - Ales typically aren't my thing but this one looked like someting special when I poured it into my Unibroue goblet S - The alcohol scent was a little strong and also a little hoppy but this is an strong ale afterall.  T - The tast also had a strong flavor of hops but this is the style. I could really start to enjoy this style if more beers were like this one.  D - Went down extrememly smooth.

Smell from the bottle was rather mild... from the glass a little better but still hid much of it's strength. Basic hoppy ale notes, nothing big on smell.  Poured a nice cola color, very red indeed. Nice bubbly head that faded rather fast... some small lacing.  Very hearty to the taste. Strong malt notes. Very thick and earthy. Has a nice bright bitter hop flare to it.

Nice lacing, the glass was covered by the end of the session.  Smell: Smelled a little funky, but in a good way. Strong hops and malts came through, a little bit of alcohol as well. Some fruitiness, but overall not very explosive or memorable.  Taste: This was memorable. It tasted like an IPA from a mediocre brew pub that had been filtered through a sock. Very funky, almost feet like taste covered my palate. Alcohol flavors take over the beers other flavors only hindered slightly by the essence of feet.  Mouthfeel: A little bit too carbonated, but overall not bad viscosity. Would have expected a slightly thicker feeling ale from its strong aromas and taste.  Drinkability: I can see where a lot of people would like this beer. Myself however, cannot get over the overwhelming taste of socks. It had some high points aswell, like its full bodied flavor with complexities if you look for them.

A very nice introduction to that awesome taste that follows.  Taste: I hope I'm worthy! Big taste explosion, with immediate hop presence that fades into a rush of malt on the finish. Bitterness stays on the tongue -- don't expect to enjoy many weaker beers after this one. Certainly for big hop-heads, as this beer leaves a big presence everywhere the beer has touched.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated, relatively heavy. Hope you like hops on the end!  Drinkability: Well, I could drink more and more of this same beer, but probably not many others.

147,92,KickInTheChalice,4.41,"Being from Chicago, when I was in San Diego I knew that it was imperative to try out some good local brews, especially from Stone Brewery. I saw this one at a liquor store the first night I was in town, and I read the label:  ""This is an aggressive beer. You probably won't like it. It is quite doubtful that you have the taste of sophistication to be able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth...""  Wow, I would have gotten it based on the name, the gargoyle, or the first line, but this beer is actually daring me to drink it. Ok, I said, let's get a 22 oz bottle and see if I can handle it.  Well, needless to say I was quite impressed. This beer kicks your ass and wonders why you are being such a wuss while taking your beating.  Appearance: Deep, dark amber with a thick off-white head that goes absolutely nowhere. As you sip it down the lace reminds you of every level the beer had been at previously. Wow, it's hard to make a beer look any better.  Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Smell: Strong hops, a bit of alcohol, strong roasted malt. I definitely smell and advanced bouquet of spices and fruit, with just a floral hint as well. A very complex aroma.  Taste: Bam! Arrogant bastard hits you with an assault of roasted malt, bringing a strong flash of caramel at first. The roasted malt also brings forth some chocolate flavors, with just a hint of vanilla as well. Just before the alcohol kicks in, I can taste a bite of cloves, which is a nice touch. From the middle on out, the hops clearly dominate. There is a fruit taste I can't quite distinguish exactly, but the bitterness is clearly there. Right at the end there is a slight, mild sweetness, with the hops still carrying the flavor.  Mouthfeel: Although medium bodied, this packs such a punch. The roasted malt adds a chewy aspect to the feel.  Drinkability: I only had to take off a half point because I wish you could session this one. It might take you 20 or so of these to figure out all of the smells and flavors.

An unusually nice looking beer.  S - Spicy, floral hops and a strong backbone of caramel and malt.  T - Strong, smoky hop bitterness, supported by dark caramel malt and a hint of roast barley. The hop flavor has a secondary role with spicy and floral flavors and a bit of citrus. Strong hop bitterness and dark malt characterize the finish.  M - A thick, chewy body, moderate carbonation, and a slightly sweet finish.  D - This is a pretty intense beer, but as every word on the bottle indicates, they were not trying to make a session beer. The hops are very aggressive and while the malt does its best to keep up with them, they dominate the flavor profile. Personally, I would prefer less emphasis on bitterness and more complex and subtle hop flavor, but that might also require less dark malt to let the hops shine through.

The aroma is mostly of grapefruit from the hops, followed by rich malt that is slightly sweet. There are hints of nuts, resin, plum, honey and vanilla. It is medium-to-full bodied with slightly soft carbonation. It is ever so smooth. It is well-bittered, lightly sweet and perhaps a bit umami. It starts citrusy and turns wooden. The aftertaste is on the long side and exhibits notes of oak, pine and juniper. The balance is superb. This really hit the spot. It's a great representation of how an American strong ale can be.

147,92,AMoceri7,2.99,"This is the definition I got for arrogant. 1 : exaggerating or disposed to exaggerate one's own worth or importance often by an overbearing manner. This beer seems to be far from the truth...ha.  A: Great burnt nut brown color. Nice head and lacing, looks very pretty, but maybe arrogant if I was being arrogant.  S: Nothing really, maybe some funky yeasty notes, some malt, a pinch of hops possibly. Overall, fairly un-aromatic.  T: Same as the smell. Nothing to it besides maybe some hop bitterness. I was really trying hard on the after taste to pick out some fruitiness but that might as well have been useless imagination. Some malt sweetness may seep through but really nothing going on here. Just some bitterness which really isnt all that bitter based on some bitter funky ales Ive had.  M: Quite smooth to say the least due to lack of flavor. I was actually put off by this due to the description on the bottle backing micro breweries and disgracing commercial brews with FLAVOR and UNIQUENESS as key players in this beer. None of which I found because uniqueness to me isnt a waste of water.  D: Okay I guess. Bought a 1 PT bottle. Couldnt finish it. So I guess it was pretty heartbreaking, glad it was only 5 bucks out of the budget.  Overall: If you are looking for flavor, intricateness, beauty, statements of faith for micro brews, this is not your beer. If you are hoping you'll look like an asshole buying this in the grocery line this might be for you. Dont waste your time or money and buy something else. And by all means, dont read the disclaimer on this, its definitely some of the best reverse psychology I have ever been a part of.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Jablonski,3.91,"Loved the beer the first time I had it a few months back. Still impressed the second time, but it wasn't as good as I'd remembered.  Appearance: first appears a deep mahogany color, but the edges change to a ruby red when held up to the light; head retention not great, but it doesn't disappear entirely  Smell: hops dominate the smell, but there is a alcohol smell afterwards that I usually don't notice an a beer that doesn't have an extreme alcohol content  Taste: the hops are most apparent, but there are sweet undertones; like others have said, I also sense a warming alochol as well (small bit of whiskey?)  Drinkability: one or two is nice, but I'm pretty satisfied after one",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,israel,3.93,"A- Crystal clear amber with a finger of light tan head. Not so much lacing as just a solid curtain of foam all the way down the glass...  S- Good sourness and reminiscent of a German beer house, which can be attributed to a lot oh hops. there is some nice maltiness in the background, but the hops are the star of the show...  T- Hops pierce the taste buds, but before it becomes overpowering a maltiness comes through and balances everything out nicely...  M- Resinous in its aftertaste, but subdued and not overpowering. Medium bodied without too much carbonation to get in the way...  D- Drinking my second bomber as I write my review, so I would say yes, very drinkable....",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Vendetta,3.96,"Original Rating Date: May 15, 2008  I really liked the aroma from the beginning- fruity and sweet. Looks fabulously, it's a nice dark amber in a trappist glass with a nice red tint to it. The taste is the very aggressive, as stated. This is a good, very balanced, very smooth beer. Surprisingly easy to drink for such a strong, in your face taste. It's a malty taste, a little bit of dark berry with some bitterness, but not overly bitter. A bit of hoppiness as well. Lots of flavor to this beer. The finish was the best part for me, it sticks around for a while and that's not at all a bad thing. American ales don't get too much better than this.  Update (06.28.2008) - Had this again tonight, and it's still as perfectly balanced as I remember. You really can't go wrong with this beer- super hoppy for an American ale and super enjoyable for anybody who enjoys beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Complex smell fruity, piney, burned the nasal cavities. Taste complex as well. Strong hoppy flavor lots of biterness. This is no ordinary ale. Thick texture at times thought I was drinking a delicious pint of blood. Really enjoyed one of these thats all I could handle in one sitting.

147,92,LilBeerDoctor,4.2,"Reviewed on 4/19/08. Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a small white head. Hoppier than I expected (a blend of floral, citrus, and piney hops), but blended really well with the malt base. The first time I had this was early in my beer palate development, so it wasn't anything special to me (especially since I didn't appreciate hops at that point). Having it a second time (now a time when IPAs and ASAs are becoming my new fave styles), I was quite pleasantly surprised and blown away by this beer! It was amazing and I can't wait to have some more again!

Creamy mocha head poured very big thick and foamy with a meringue like top then faded slowly to nice thickish covering... barely any carbonation... some decent lines of lacing...  Aroma - Lots of toasted toffee and caramel maltiness, strong piney, citrusy and peppery hop notes, dark dried fruits (figs, prunes, cherries), toffee apples, some booziness, toasted nuttiness, earthy, light liquorice, some overripe banana and orange, malt loaf, burnt sugar sweetness, some faint coffee traces, hints of leather...  Taste is very complex... initial blast of citrus hops and piney resin followed by good toasted bready and toffee malts, fruit cake notes, treacle sweetness, lots of rich fruits (figs, prunes, raisins, spicy apples, bitter oranges), hint of warming alcohol (traces of rum ?), butterscotch, faint metallic traces, some medicinal notes...  Feel - Smooth and slightly oily initially then a little sharpness comes through... medium / full bodied... for a big, bold and boozy brew this is dangerously drinkable stuff...

147,92,Patrick999,3.93,"On tap last night at the Titanic.  A - Clear reddish brown, a solid thumbnail of off-white head.  S - Citrusy hops.  T - Big hit of grapefruit Cascades, big hit of relatively sweet caramel malt underneath. Some alcohol noted. Comes off here to me as an extra malty double IPA, which is fine with me. No real difference noted between tap and bottle, as I'd just had a bomber a few days ago.  F - Very good; crisp and drying with a little sweet hop stickiness to accent.  D - I did a double-take, seeing Stone on tap at a local brewpub. It's good to have them here. Arrogant Bastard is a drinkable beer in the sense that you could have one or two with dinner.

147,92,superdedooperboy,3.93,"Enjoyed this on-tap at the Limelight Cafe in Augusta, GA.  Appearance is a gorgeous deep ruby with a rich, creamy half-inch of light tan froth. Head dissipates slowly and shows good retention, leaving behind nice thick rings of lace on the glass.  Aroma is not very strong, and notes are hard to discern, but citrus hop notes and perhaps some dark fruits appear.  Medium in body; carbonation is tingly and just right. Tastes very much of grapefruit and other citrus notes, with a tart sour cherry flavor discernible as well, with some bitter hop notes showing themselves in the middle. All of this is surrounding a core of fruity, sweet malt and yeast flavors. Finish is mildly bitter with a lingering tart dryness.  Not the most drinkable of brews, though the finish does beg for more. Alcohol makes itself known a little as the beer warms, but overall is well-hidden. Extremely pleasurable; the arrogance is not unfounded.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,brewmudgeon,3.97,"22 oz. bomber, about cellar temp  4 appearance. clear ruby, short head drops to a ring (a harder pour produces a fairly lasting, rocky head of one to two fingers), cascading lace.  4.5 smell. very interesting . . . tart cherries, new leather, milk choc? but predominately tropical: pineapple, papaya. and there's an underlying resiny smell, hints of deep cherry sweetness, and perhaps bubble gum. practically no alcohol odor intrudes. nice.  4 taste. deliciously complex and surprisingly reserved up front. layers of flavor build in quickly, with the sweet fruity resinyness battling a bitter grapefruit rind sharpness. for a moment it seems the rind will be too dominant then the finish tapers quickly, though certainly not completely--a bit of the tart bitterness hangs on pretty much indefinitely. the fruitiness at times seems a bit overdone, like they added essence of tropical juicy fruit. if that's all from yeast it sure is intriguing--SN said they're the only ones with the tropical flavored citra hop, so.... the acidity can detract a bit too, and there is certain palate-numbing effect i keep getting, very odd. overall still interesting and good.  3.5 mouthfeel. plenty of carbonation, but a bit thin for the abv and flavor profile. a tad on the light side of medium.  3.5 drinkability. despite the interesting flavor profile, not sure i'd want to drink this often. the numbing effect and the acidity are deterrents, but there is also something missing in the flavor spectrum that could tie it all together and leave a greater sense of satisfaction.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Started with the appearance, it pours a beautiful dark reddish, amber color. The appearance is maybe one of my favorite aspects of the beer.

The beer is incredibly balance with a huge bitterness coming through at the end, but a sweetness lingers through the whole tasting. There is a great complexity of hops and maltiness that I can't quite put my tongue on. It's like the hops and malts are fighting for the forefront of the flavour but end up having a great compromise! I think I might have to check into chinook hops! This remeinds me of a beefed up Red Ale. The mouthfeel is nice any creamy! Exactly what I'd expect! The ale is pretty god damn drinkable as well!

147,92,ThreeWiseMen,3.88,"Poured this into a ""Cheers"" (like the TV show) mug. Never reviewed a beer in a mug before, so I thought I'd give it a try. This is Wiseman Nick btw.  Appearance: Pours a dark, earthy red with 1 finger, tight, creamy, khaki head. Head is very sticky and retains well. Body is very hazy - almost completely opaque. Beautiful web-like lacing follows the head all the way down.  Smell: Right off the bat I get strong citrus and caramel. Caramel aroma is very rich, more like molasses or syrup. Nice wood and pine aromas accompany a solid hop backbone. Getting some apple and faint alcohol as well.  Taste: Wood and caramelized malts upfront. Earthy, resiny hops in the back. Citrus kick comes in about midway and hangs around into the aftertaste. Finishes very bitter, especially for a strong ale. Kind of surprised the flavor wasn't more pungent. Tastes like an above average, full-bodied IPA.  Mouthfeel: Starts off extremely smooth and creamy and finishes oily and bitter. Carbonation is pretty low and body is full. Very nice warming and good numbing to boot.  Drinkability: Pretty damn drinkable, but not very true to the style.

The head eventually subsides into a patchy layer of bubbles on top and a medium-sized ring around the glass. Lacing is decent.  Smells of caramel malt and slight pine aromas. I remember the bottle version having much more of a hop presence.  Tastes the same way it smells, lots of malt with subtle piney hop flavors and a mild bitter ending. As with the smell, I remember the bottle version having bigger hop flavors and a more bitter ending.  Mouthfeel is good. Good thickness, with the carbonation being a little on the light side.  Drinkability is good. I prefer a bit more hop presence, but it's still a solid beer.  Overall I'm a bigger fan of this from the bottle. I like the more robust hop flavors and bitterness.

T - Taste is much different than expected due to the appearance - the hops are strong, but are very well balanced with malt; pleasant. And as in your face as the bitter hops strat out at first sip, the malt seems to mellow them as you continue to sip. D - Very nice, I could drink a few of these.

Retention was better then average yielding a sparse covering with a thin stratified layering for a lacing. Visible carbonation appeared moderate.  S: The nose yielded fresh pink grapefruit with fresh green pin needles. Some sugary notes sweetens things up a bit.  T: The initial flavor was fresh pink grapefruit, pine resin, with a nice dry maltiness similar in nature to rye. Some dry booziness of whiskey cask notes with a moderately strong and pungent grapefruit hoppinesss that was flowery. Some sticky pine resin and dry boozy alcohol finishes things up here.  M: A rich, boozy nature and dry palate leaves the tongue perched from the massive helping of Chinook hopping contributing its big pungent grapefruit hoping and fade on the tongue. A nice full viscosity, oily, with a very light carbonation factor. Malty, smooth with a big boozy finish.  D: At first tasting it lives up to its name but seems to continuously get smoother with every sip there after.

Underneath you can detect a little sweetness, but the hops are king here.  Taste: Has a hoppy bite to it, kind of like an IPA.

The malts on the nose in this beer are quite powerful and mask the smell of the hop profile nicely. The thick malty syrup-like quality to this beer makes it like no other (except oak aged and double bastard).

The typical suspects were present a light piney grapefruit aroma. I guess I was expecting more, but the taste, oh the taste, mmm. Amplify the smell by at least 3X. Like licking a grapefruit in a pine forest, POW! I mean that in a good way.  Take it for a tour around the molars and you really notice the grapefruit hoppy taste with pine undertones.

The head did fizzle down after a minute or so.  This ale has a rich mahogony color to it, somewhat cloudy but not overly so.  The aroma that srtuck me was a sort of blend of malty caramel and pine; there was a strong hop presence.

A woodsy taste hits with the malt and leaves a pleasant and long lasting after taste.  M - Medium bodied.  D - Strong tasting and satisfying. This is a good beer for sure, but I might tire of the strong flavors in this one after a couple.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,donteatpoop,4.11,"The bottle was pretty badass, the info on the back made me laugh like an idtiot.  It poured a nice deep ruby red with a thick head that retained nicely and left a lacing residue on the glass.  Smelled very hoppy, vaguely funky.  The taste was interesting, difficult to describe, but interesting. The hops hit heavy first, tasted like a blend of hops; a slight bite hit the mouth, and the alcohol was a bit strong. The more I drank of it, the better it tasted, a bit sweet perhaps, but not overly so. There's a lot of depth in the taste of this one.  Smooth in the mouth, rolls nicely over the tongue.  Very drinkable despite the strong presence of alcohol.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,gory4d,4.2,"Pours into my mug with a tan three-finger head that dissipates quickly though some remains all the way down to leave thick lacing down the glass. The smell is woodsy, maybe some cedar in there, with hints of fruit (berry?) and some biscuity notes. The taste is huge from start to finish: starts off with sweet malts, moves through to diacetyls and faint caramel, then hits you hard with a hop finish that goes on and on -- big hits of grapefruit or tangelo, maybe even lemon rind. The hop finish also makes for a rather pleasantly dry mouthfeel in the end, though before that what strikes me is the smoothness of it: perfectly carbonated, just enough to fill your mouth with all this goodness. Glad to find this fresh from the keg: I prefer it to the bottled version.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ElGeordie,4.68,"The dogs bollox. I had a couple of (imperial) pints of AB at the British Beer Co in Walpole MA the other night. I'm not really a big drinker of anything 6% ABV and above, but I'm glad I made an exception. The beer travelled really well from CA to the East coast. This is a mighty pint: it looks great just the way a beer should -clear medium amber colour with half an inch of creamy head. I'm not one for smelling beer but I didn't notice anything untoward. Arrogant Bastard is an all out assault on the taste buds: hops a plenty with multitudes of malty afternotes. I'd like to try this for a full session (with a designated driver) the more I drank, the more I enjoyed it. It is a beer with so much depth and character, words can't do it justice. Go out and get some - you won't regret it - at least until the next morning.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Not really unbalanced, but definitely heavy on hops! The malt really comes out as the beer warms.  M - A bit sticky, not overly carbonated  D - more drinkable than I expected at the first sip, it's starting to grow on me  Not as good as I was led to believe, but then again I'm not really a hophead.

A: Dark, Tootsie roll burned caramel brown with slim off-white head but lace streams down the glass in delicate formations.  S: Delcious floral and fruity hops (pineapple and grapefruit) meet the nose first followed by toffee and dark fruit aromas.  T: An unparalleled combination of caramel and dark fruit flavors with a bit of spicy zing completed by a grapefruit-pineapple hops finish.  M: Body is full with fairly active carbonation for a strong ale. Aftertaste is mildly drying and malty.  D: One of the ultimate American ales: explosive flavor matched with surprising drinkability.

147,92,PerzentRizen,4,"""You're Not Worthy!"" I love it!!! I have to say I almost shit myself when I read the bottle. Everything about this beer screams hilarious. The cool thing about Arrogant Bastard is it walks the walk too! I can't believe how close this tastes to Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye Ale - only much much better. The hop character is amazing.  I poured mine into a Duvel tulip glass. A nice frothy head appeared and then reduced to a thin lace. This beer is cloudy and you can definately tell it's from the hops from the first whiff down to the last swig.  The aroma is of moutains of fresh hop resin and miles of barley and what I believe is at least some rye. Who knows the IBU count on this one? I think it's classified.  The flavor is amazingily complex. The first thing you taste is sweet grain and a biscuit mouthfeel that quickly and suddenly morphs to a mouth, nose, and throat full of hops. Weird in a really cool way. I love this ale!  The mouthfeel is full and robust. I love the fact that this ale is not fully attenuated. The 7.3% abv is just about perfect for the body and flavor. The alcohol is almost imperceptible.  I would give this ale high marks for drinkability if not for the huge hop bite. I love it and can drink a gallon of it, but I am afraid I must rate the style without regard to personal preference.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,bonkers,4.33,"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer is a toasted color of caramel. The head is thick, fluffy, and sticky. There are several layers of lacing in this bad boy. The smell is deceptively sweet with a hint of alchohol. The brew is smooth. This a very well balanced beer. The first sip is sweet and almost bready, Then a wonderful waterfall of alcohol coats the tongue. The finish is of wonderful aromatics, with hints of pear. The beer has medium body and is very drinkable. I think it would complement a steak very nicely.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

A - Deep amber body, tightly tan head that lingers and laces down the glass, perfectly dispersed carbonation that begs to be tasted.  S - Deep coniferous forest scent under the cover of a soft layer of sweet malt. Very well balanced presentation for a hoppy ale.  T - Deep coniferous forest scent paves the way to a rich piney taste that is absolutely wonderful. Malt shows itself through various tastings at assumed different temperatures in the middle of most tastings.  M - Medium bodied pine palate that feels clean going down and leaves a trail on the palate of the rich hops.

The smell is predominately of malt, with date and raisin undertones. A bit of hop smell is evident at the onset. Taste is of clove, raisin, date, fig, pine, and hop. Very complex, this is a beer to savor. Absolutely superb malt, hop balance. Mouthfeel is excellent, with just the right amount of hop finish. I'm afraid I have found a new favorite beer.

S- Served a bit cold, so the aromas were not immediately available. Piney hoppy, but noticable maltiness.  T- Fair when cold, but developed nicely as it warmed. Good balance of hops and malt. Pine type hoppiness, but subtle.  M- Pleasant texture, not oily as expected based on hop level.  D- Too drinkable for a 7%+ beer. After 2, I took a walk to test the affects. OK, but 3 would be pushing it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

A: Pours a very clear, rich amber color with a long-lasting light-tan head that has the consistency of cappucino foam.  S: Smells of citrusy hops and a bit of malty sweetness.  T: Sweet at first, and then the hops hit. Hop bitterness lingers for a long time.  M: Rich and smooth up front, aided by the creamy head and malty sweetness. Carbonation and hops take over from there, with an almost spicy tingle towards the end of each sip.  D: Exceptionally drinkable, at least if you're a hophead. The complex and agressive flavors are overwhelming, and you can easily forget this is a 7.2% ABV beer... until you try to stand up.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

That moment came and this was the supreme beer for the occassion. It pours a dark, rich brown with a velvety tan head. It smells as complex as it tastes. Notes of hops and strong maltiness, but its also earthy and somewhat bitter, but sweet at the same time. It was crazy. I was in love. Somehow all of these flavours; the honey notes, the bitter coffee, the earthy richness, and the bite of the alcohol, all work together marvelously. It has a creamy mouthfeel that makes it even better.

Hints of brown sugar & vanilla--maybe a little maple. Some malt and oak.  T - Malty sweetness initially. The oak kicks in pretty strongly with a little bitterness in the aftertaste. It gets more palatable as it warms. Some maple & vanilla flavors are definitely present. Good but the slight bitterness at the end bugs me.  M - Medium to Medium-thick on the tongue.  D - Not bad.

147,92,demcorhip,4.23,"About freaking time I got to pour myself one of these. Thanks for coming to Wisconsin. A very nice looking brew, quite dark in colour, almost brown with ruby tinged highlights. Very nice, tight, pale tan head formed on a gentle pour into my jar, got almost three fingers worth and it really wants to stick around. Mildly yet persistently carbonated. Already leaving an interesting, intricate and sticky web inside the glass as the head slowly recedes.  Prickly hops with the aroma of ruby red grapefruit greet the nose first. Creamy toffee and whole grain crusty bread follows, along with a hint of toffee and some earthy qualities.  A damn fine brew. Toffee and hints of treacle and honey make for a sturdy malt backbone that stand up to the assault that follows. The hops appear towards the middle and last long into the finish, initially clean flavours of grapefruit appear, and give way to notes of burley tobacco and an almost earthy, woody bitterness.  This is a big, creamy, medium bodied ale. Just how this got started in the warmth of southern cali is beyond me, as this is big, sturdy beer that just seems to be made for a more unforgiving climate. A touch of the alcohol reveals itself in a slight warmth, but the interplay between the rich malts and somewhat aggressive use of hops is what gives this brew its well deserved arrogance.  Pretty drinkable for what this beer is, no quarter was expected and none was given. A nice brew for taking one's time with. Im starting to see just why Stone has experienced so much success, and look forward to experiencing more from this brewery, thankfully I have a few bottles from them in my cellar. This is a beer that was brewed to satisfy the arrogant bastard within me and it does a great job of it. Highly recommended for those that enjoy bigger beers that carry a substantial hop presence.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Decent lacing.  S - Huge piney and grapefruit hop aroma with just a touch of pineapple. Something sweet and fruity lurks in the background.  T - Citrus and fruity flavors from the hops ride atop a simple, sweet malt profile with a suggestion of brown sugar and butterscotch. Late palate the brew dries out with a big piney/grassy and bitter hop note coupled with a slight peppery burn from the alcohol. A coarse, citric bitterness lingers in the aftertaste, the only thing keeping this from a 5.  M - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation.

The head starts as about half an inch of off-white froth, but dissipates quicker than I would like into little continents of thin foam. Lace, however, is the most impressive aspect of the head, and the everlasting ring around the glass paints it afresh with every sip.  Smell of citrus hops, specifically grapefruit, is present, though not overpowering. Also some heavier notes, such as caramel.  Tastes true to the aromas, with hints of pine. Something about the name led me to believe that this would be super hoppy, though the hops are actually well balanced.  Nice mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation, medium bodied overall.

I tasted sweet malt all the way, with the spicy hops dancing in and out through the middle. The finish was dry and full of warming alcohol goodness.  MF= Heavier side of medium bodied. Carbonation was present and gave a clean mouthfeel without being too sharp.  D= I've now had this ale on tap, in the bottle and also the oaked version. I have to say that I really love this ale.

Solid caramel malt base with a pine hop compliment. Bitterness is moderate. The alcohol is apparent but not hot. It adds to the overall flavor profile of this beer.  Medium body with low carbonation.

Lots of floral hops and a sweet malt at first, then as it warms up the hops turn more pine-y and the malt smooths out a bit, with more of a caramel aroma.  T: Piney hops and sweet malts from the get go, and as it warms the piney flavor is toned down a bit. The caramel malt flavor really helps provide an excellent base! A bitter kick that gains steam as the beer warms.  M: Mouthfeel is good. A bit thin at first, but as with the rest of the beer's attributes it gets better as it warms. Hops are a bit overpowering lacking a bit of balance.  D: Well, finally got the pleasure of enjoying this brewhaha and was not disappointed.

Near the end of the bottle, I guess I have acclimated a bit to the bitterness presence of hops, giving leaving me with a non-sweet citrus only taste. Kind of reminds me of grapefruit.

T: Hop bitterness, sweet caramel malt; typical North County flavor profile  M: Thick and creamy with lingering hop bitterness. Low carbonation.  D: A very drinkable brew but the alcohol sneaks up on you, so watch out  This beer has a special place in my heart. It's one of the first brews I fell in love with when I moved out to SF.

Caramel malts and cherry are present as well as some earthy malts and some cherries. Hops and a hint of yeast make this one nice and balanced.  Taste of caramel malts and hops initially, fading slowly with earthy malts and some spice coming in. Finish is dry and hoppy with a bit of spice.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, but kind of uneven.

Mild carbonation that makes this easy to drink for a heavier than average beer. Taste is malty. Tastes a tad smokey to me, but I like it (maybe I'm drinking it wrong?).

Good, thick body with a very nice, creamy head; little carbonation. This is really where this beer excels.  Overall, a very decent beer, but a bit more bitter than I would like in a beer like this; the hops are a bit overpowering.

Smells amazing, juicy, citrusy, piney hops at the forefront with malt in the background. Tastes citrusy and piney with a fair bit of caramel and toffee malt to back it up. On the lighter side of moderate carbonation with a body bordering on viscous, slick. A plethora of pleasant tastes all balanced perfectly. Rich slick mouthfeel.

Somewhat musky, with a kind of sour, mildly piney hoppiness. The taste isn't too distant from the scent. Nice hops coming through, dry and piney with citrus tones. Reminds me a bit of potpurri. Sour and woody, befitting of its name this one with a long, though not terribly complex finish. On the light side of medium in body.

The foam is intensely bitter, but the nose is only faintly of hops.  The beer lands on the palette with a big, round hop flavor. Really crisp, but also satisfyingly filling. The level of carbonation is just right to give the beer a brightness or sharpness which stops short of being acidic.  I'm used to this arrogant bastard, which may be why I find it well calibrated for American Strong Ale (i.e. not IPA). It does have that overpowering, palette-smashing bitterness to it which makes me think that a second glass would be a waste. It really needs something salty to balance it out.  Huh. The bottle (or the paint on the bottle, anyway) apparently contains Cadmium and is therefore going to kill me and eat my children.

It has a very elusive aroma profile. Not too malty, yeasty or hoppy. They all meld very well. Flavour is way hoppier than the aroma would lead you to think. Again kind of elusive. Bitter hops, some plum and then an almost chocolate like malt presence. Dry and bitter and slightly roasty on the finish. Mouthfeel is full but not heavy or oily. Carbonation is medium.

Taste is great, very hoppy and at the same time perfect malt balance. Between the smell and taste you would think you are chewing on flowers/hops...love it.

Some malts in there as well, a touch of fruit but not too much, but the hops are the focus.  Diving in gives the hops up front with malts. Not sweet malts but there are caramel and estery flavors. somewhat unexpected, but helps the balance. then more hops come charging in to finish things off on more of a bitter and dry note. Can't really catch too much of the alcohol taste even at this abv... well hidden. i like.

The head retains at a thick creamy sheet and leaves wide bands of lacing on the glass.  The smell of the drink is spicy and citrusy, with lots of grapefruit and a resinous sting.  The taste of the drink is complex and semi-dry, with toasty interjections of sweet caramel. The malt character is complex-- both sweet and dry; fruity and biscuity; succulent, but chewy? The hops onboard the drink are similarly multitalented, bringing their citrusy-tropical-fruit-hoppiness and the toasty, crispy, juicy pale-maltiness together with a spicy blast of more/different fruity hops that raises the bitterness level a bit. Earthy hops dry the aftertaste, even as a dry malty syrup lingers, sticky and soothing in the mouth. Uh, hoppy.  Exquisite feel, fullish-medium in body and drinkability off the scale for style.

147,92,pmcadamis,3.85,"A - A khaki dense foam slowly builds up to two fingers in my snifter. The head looks dense and chewy, and tons of wet lace slides down the glass. This looks dark brown on the desk, but shows clear deep garnet hues when held to the light. The purple-brown-red hue is hard to describe, but it sho' is perty. Head retention is decent, but not magical. I guess an Arogant Bastard is likely to quickly loose his head right?  S - This smells much more subdued than I would expect from a beer that touts it's arrogance. I expected a wall of nose-hair-curling hops or a sharp acidity or a heavy load of malt. Instead, this is like a mild late-autumn day. Mellow, pleasant, and earthy. There are some really nice aged hop notes here, but they are not the star of the show. This smells like a harvested corn field littered with crackling brown autumn leaves.  T - Initially mild and sweet, this begins to show it's arrogance on the midpalate, when it starts to build a nice sour lactic flavor than intensifies at the finish. This is definitely par for the course for an Old Ale...you can almost taste the passage of time in a dank moldy basement. Earthy and leafy...like a deep hole full of dead leaves. Much more assertive than the nose, with a good dose of 2XIPA level hops.  M - Full bodied and sugary. I can feel the dextrinous sweetness coating my tongue, and the very subdued carbonation is insufficient to wipe away the sugar. Fat and blubbery. Chubby even. The bitterness intensifies after the swallow and keeps building for a few minutes. That amazing level of bitterness saves this beer's ass....big time.  D - This definitely has some complex an interesting flavors, but I really don't see what all of the hoopla is about. This is a good beer, but the name has me puzzled. Arrogant Bastard makes me think of a massive 2XIPA that gives you the shivers with hop electricity, a RIS that kills you with thick motor-oil black evil, or a puckery geueze/lambic that strips the enamel from your teeth with battery acid chemistry. What is so aggressive about a mildly sour old ale? It's good, but not stellar.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Extremely well balanced, the hops come through at just the right time and leave a subtle hop aftertaste that leaves the you wanting another sip.

S- Smell is mostly sweet, sticky caramel malts with a hint of alco-hops. Light fruit profile alike a pear.  T- Taste is wonderfully balanced, but beware, all the ingredients seem to have been practically doubled to make for a powerful taste that you may not expect. Begins with sweet caramel/chocolate malts on the tongue and then starts to fill the mouth with pungent hops and more malt. Ends with a sting of alcohol and hops that leaves you wanting another sip  M- Feel is excellently medium-full bodied and makes my mouth feel alive in many ways I haven't felt in awhile  D- Drinks almost too good for how strong it is.

Some subtle phenolic tones from the alcohol give way to sweet fruit flavors as it warms.  M - Full-bodied, wet finish. My God, it's like drinking a meal!

Back then, the name alone drew me to pull it off the rack, while my second time around it was more of a desire to revisit what so many other beer friends quaff on a regular basis. Friends at the campfire got a good kick out other 'your not worthy' and PR campaign diatribe on the back of the bottle.  A: Bomber poured into over sized wine glass to display a dark amber top and coppery bottom. Tough guy one and head khaki head that laced to the moon and retain at medium level till the very last drop. It pleasure to hoist above my head and look at with true admiration.  N: Nose was roasted malts to start off with, then moving to caramle sweentess then settling in to a citrus neighborhood. Now that is what I call a true allure to the beer aficinado.  T: Clench your stomach because your about to get your pallet smashed with a library of flavors. The ABV level is a non factor in putting this fine creation down your throat. You can say it follows the nose but that's if you can keep up with the merry-go round of flavors. I would say the hops with citrus accents are what you get first off, but quickly get bumped off by the wonderul and more powerful sweet malts that probably have caramel coated all over them. The malts and hops marry each other well like any good marriage of opposites.  M: A rugged chewyness of medium to thick body, good tangy carbonation and slick third finish.

Aroma is very hearty, hoppy. Pine, orange and other citrus aromas. Smells and looks sort of heavy and dense. Medium-bodied with a bit of carbonation that balances wonderfully. Feels hearty without being dense. Despite hoppy flavor and taste, does not feel oily. Taste is strongly of malts, pine and citrus, as the aroma suggested.

A good example of west coast hoppiness. I also taste some flowers, brown sugar, hints of butterscotch and more alcohol. For only being 7.2 ABV, the alcohol presence was a bit too noticable and a bit of a bummer.  I think of this beer as one of the forefathers of the widely available American ""Big"" beer revolution.

Anyway, the beer comes with a deep mahogany colour, slight haze, with a generous head of fairly creamy consistency. Fairly pungent aroma of caramel malt and hop aromatics.

It has a subtle but full carbonation and it is very easy to guzzle this stuff. The hops sneak up on you after a while with more bite, ending up all over your tongue.

The Arrogant Bastard was pretty much what I expected... a bad ass ale with enough hops, malt and alcohol to separate the men from the boys.  A: Nice reddish-brown color with a 1"" head that dissipated quickly, leaving a medium lacing.  SM: Hops, barley, light roast smell. Nice!  M: Medium body, creamy and malty; crisp finish.  T: Good hops flavor that is balanced with the malt. A little roasty with a dry, hoppy aftertaste but not overly bitter. The flavor stays with you and makes you want another sip.  D: I liked the Bastard! This ale went really well with a grilled tuna steak with spicy habanero sauce and grilled asparagus but I could enjoy this one on its own.  One bomber wasn't enough so I won't make the mistake of not buying more next time.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,JoeMayo,4.02,"A- Pours an amber-brown color with a decently thick head. I was a little suprised at the amount of lacing left behind when I was done.  S- This beer smells unique and wonderful. It has a dark, malty smell with a clear hop presence. The scent of alcohol comes through slightly, especially as the beer warms.  T- The strong malt smell does not come through as strongly in the taste. As a matter of fact, it's way in the background. Agressively bitter hop flavors come through with notes of grapefruit.  M- Medium carbonation and medium body with a crisp finish  D- Like most Stone beers, this one should definately be done in moderation. As much as I like this beer, its bitterness is quite agressive and after one bomber, I feel something maltier or sweeter is more than welcome",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,OWSLEY069,3.63,"Pours a deep copper color with a tan head. In the aroma, a big malt presence, and a gritty hop. In the taste, hoppy, small grapefruit notes, and an abrasive maltiness. A bitter medium to big mouthfeel, and a dryer hop aftertaste. Big hops, abrasive, and a palate destroyer. Good, but an ending beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Beefeater57,4.7,"A: Dark ruby-brown, thick creme-head. It looks incredible. That simple.  S: A lot going on with the smell. I get some sweet smell, like cherries. But, I also get a ashy-smoky smell too. A hint of earthiness from the hops.  T: Quite an intriguing beer. As I was swallowing the first sip, I was thinking ""I'm not noticing the hops much"" and then it just grows in the aftertaste. A bunch of flavors just weaving in and out from sip to swallow to aftertaste. A very sweet malty start, in which I get that slight cherry taste I detected in the smell. The big flavor sits on your tongue after you swallow. I got hints of dark chocolate and the hops grow in the aftertaste. Bitter, but pleasant. Like all Stone beers, the hop flavor is just great. Love the taste it leaves in your mouth.  M: No complaints at all. Perfect body, smooth.  D: I really wish they had six-packs of this stuff. However, a bomber of this is all you need. It is quite the experience, haven't had a beer like this before. Complex, flavorful and always keeps you guessing on what you detect from it. Very malty, very hoppy - a perfect American strong ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,drxandy,4.23,"An awesome extra to find in trade from Ben4881, Thanks man! :D  Served slightly above room temperature, Bomber to standard pint glass, a heavy pour yields a foamy tan head, good retention - pours a hot amber golden shade  smells of deep good malts, caramel/toffee sweetness, hops add a herbal zest  taste is hot but very smooth, bitter, aggressive citric hop finish, sweet malts, creamy, lots of character and depth, very nice  mouthfeel is thick and delicious, the hop resins cling around forever and the alcohol presence is muted but still present.

147,92,kinger,4.55,"The back of the bottles describes this as an ""aggressive"" beer, I was curious as to the meaning of this. After one taste I immediately understood and was instantly hooked. This is one of the best ales ever to pass my lips. The flavor is so complex it was like the fourth of July in my mouth. I can't wait to try their other brews. //12-7-07: I've enjoyed a number of bombers since my initial review including one tonight. This brew is one of the first beers that really lead me to the craft beer craze and for that I am very thankful. Some additional comments in regards to this great beer to complete this review. Pours a dark, burnt copper color with a very large tan head and sticky lacing. A very aromatic hop scent is emitted into the air. Bitter citrus with caramel and sweet breads. I can't believe how well the aroma permeates the air surrounding the top of the glass. Creamy on the palate with a nice bite and puckering finish. Medium bodied and filling. Grand flavor of resinous hops and roasted, sweet malts. A touch nutty, grapefruit and spruce. The flavor sticks to your ribs and assaults the senses. Overall a nicely aggressive and flavorful ale, still one of my favorites that I look forward to returning to every once in a while. A sentimental beer that deserves it's rating.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,mcmidc,4.4,"It poured a beautiful deep amber color with a tan head that left quite a bit of lacing. The aroma is a hoppy and floral with some lingering spices. Taste is malty up front with sweet spices, some tangerine maybe also. Then there is an abundance of hops that explode in your mouth, and it finishes clean. There is slight carbonation up front, with nice creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability is fairly good. I'm on the bandwagon, very nice brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,swigger,4.01,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass (topped off twice before finished). Served at 60 degrees.  Appearance - Really good looking copper color with a tan, 2-finger foamy head that dissipates and leaves moderate lacing down the glass.  Smell - Slight floral hop smell and sweet malt. Don't smell too much in this beer.  Taste - Knocks you on your ass from the first sip. Huge hop bitterness, but fairly balanced with malt sweetness. Starts off very sweet and the bitterness comes in alongside the alcohol.  Mouthfeel - Fair amount of carbonation. Feels very, very heavy in the mouth. Hop bitterness stays in your mouth until the next time you brush your teeth. The alcohol can be felt as well, there's no hiding the 7.4 ABV in this brew.  Drinkability - Took me nearly 90 minutes to drink the 22oz bomber and there will be no more imbibing for me tonight. Definitely something you'll want to set aside some time to drink.  Overall, something I will definitely buy again. It's a bit pricey but worth it for those occasions where you want a very strong brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,laituegonflable,4.1,"Pours a deep ruby red colour with a thin but sticky head. A little bit of lacing which looks sticky and great. Very mild carbonation. Looks robust and impressive.  The brew has a sweet, brown-sugar kind of character on the nose, but brimming with potential. It's a strong and complex nose with essence of sultanas peeping through as well.  Wow, doesn't that taste knock your balls off. It's a bit of everything; sour and gritty in parts and a little bit sweet on the finish. The taste just hangs around with a powerful depth like really dark coffee. There's so much to it and it's good, really good. The flavours I can pick are hints of burnt toffee, espresso and a slight plummy character. Very gritty finish, but gritty as in a strong coffee. Mouthfeel is astonishingly smooth and creamy for such a rich, complex ale.  Overall, very impressive and venerable. Not drinkable all the time but I definitely dig this.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,KeefD,4.22,"Poured from a bomber into a snifter. Dark brown in color. Smell is hoppy, which is odd for a dark beer, but I like it. Taste is heavy on the citrus hops, backed up by a sweet roasty malt character that gives this brew an interesting complexity. Like nothing I've had before. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and well carbonated, but goes down fairly easy. We'll put this one in the medium-bodied category. The bomber is going down fast, mostly because the flavor is so big and so delicious. But the ABV, which isn't incredibly high, can be felt and tasted keeping this to a once in sitting delight.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Baileyuk,3.81,"A - True definition of exceptional. Great head that retains some of its head throughout the pint. Lacing was also exceptional. A very attractive beer.  S - little bland but still good. A sweet malt smell where a good level of hops was also present.  T - Good ale, it was pleasant drink but the whole time I was trying to figure out the style. A definate hybrid  M - heavier than I thought. As you swallow the tastes develop greatly.  D - Surprisingly drinkable for the abv but by no means a session beer and one that I would not mind revisiting but I like others more.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Gtreid,4.4,"22oz. bomber poured into a standard pint glass.  A: Vibrant, mahogony red color with one finger of tan colored head that retained well and left a good amount of sticky lacing.  A: Much more hoppy than what I was expecting. Citrus and pine hops with a very nice sweet malt that balances the nose very well.  T: Man, this is a fine tasing ale. The citrus and pine hops are balanced so well with the malts. Sweet, citrusy, and finishes extremelly smooth.  M&D: The moderate amount of carbonation makes for an increadiblly smooth mouthfeel for this medium bodied ale. Drinkability is through the roof, at 7.2% ABV I could session this. Probably my favorite American Strong Ale I have had to date. Excellent! Skal.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,lacqueredmouse,4.22,"Thanks very much to my GF for bringing this back from the States for me.  Pours with a ruby-flecked dark amber body. Shiny and clear, capped with a yellow-white head of filmy bubbles. Fantastic lacing, but minimal carbonation. Love the colour, looks like a great, strong, ale.  Amazing nose, huge hits of American hops, tropical fruits, aniseed, pineapple, passionfruit, capsicum, resin, berries. Delicious, luscious, rich. Hint of something deeper and darker as well, perhaps bourbon or strong vanilla. One hell of a rich smelling beer.  Initial vegetative hint of crushed lime leaves on the palate; that fresh, natural character, followed by quite a strong resiny hop bitterness. Peppery, astringent and robust. Quite delicious and fragrant. Pine, lime zest and lots more of the pointy end of the taste spectrum. Alcohol hidden behind the hop character. Quite delicious. Mouthfeel is quite syrupy, thick and smooth.  This is, truly, an aggressive beer. But it's a well brewed one, and it has a measure of balance to its madness. Full-flavoured, rich, robust and unforgettable.  I'm very glad I got to try it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,CaptainIPA,3.65,"P: Served on-tap @ Romans' Pub on 7-18-08 and presented in an Arrogant Bastard Ale pint glass.  A: Pours a deep ruby color with a one-finger, tan-colored head that hangs impressively.  S: Citrus hops aroma with layers of malty sweetness.  T: Citrus hops with big notes of sweet, caramel malts and hints of oak. As it warms, grapefruit and pine come into play. Bitterness buzzes the palate throughout the session and lingers at the finish.  M: Full-bodied with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Active carbonation attacks at mid-tongue.  D: An American Strong Ale, indeed. Two and you're worthy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,JRed,4.06,"The dark amber in body topped by gargantuan off-white head. Smell is of cloves, grass, plastic action figure (no joke), some pepper, hop resin. The taste is smooth and has flavors of grass, plastics, hop resin, mild breadiness, toast and roast, booze, smooth bitterness, dry grainy finish but some resiny aftertaste persists. A little smokey and medium bodied in mouthfeel. This beer can hang out in the palate for a while, light carbonation doesn't attack the tongue and it smoothly flows down. The drinkability allows for you to keep hanging out with the Arrogant Bastard, hell, he could even stay the night. But he may want a brew too.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Reagan1984,4.7,"Deep Red/Amber in color with a thick creamy head. This beer is crystal clear and there is very little visible carbonation. A mild amount of lacing remained in the glass.  I was most shocked by the rather intense hop aroma. I loved it, but was not really expecting aromas that were this much out of the hop family. Pine aroma, citrus fruit..  The taste was excellent. Very well balanced with a very smooth taste throughout. A nice spiciness and more pine/ grapefruit flavors. There was a nice malt presence that really worked well with the assertive hops.  Medium in body but extremely drinkable for a 7% plus brew. The Alcohol was very well hidden. Again, this was a remarkably smooth beer.  This is one that you must try and one that I will be enjoying again.  Excellent.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ibbjamin,4.28,"Paid $3.99 for a bomber from Monument Liquor in Concord, CA. Poured into a snifter.  Nice inch and a half somewhat frothy creme colored head that retains quite well. Very deep and dark ruby in color. Thick lasting lace.  Smells like silky smoked malts and hints of alcohol with a slight balance of hops in the background. Mmmm....  Silky smooth, rivaling some of the better Belgians I've had. Very easy to drink. Tasty. Smoky and sweet malts balanced out by some bitter hops in the finish. Alcohol well hidden. Lightly carbonated.  Big fan of this brew. Highly recommended.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ALESwhatCURESya,4.41,"A-deep chestnut ruby body with large and airy off-white head. Very nice clarity and tons of lacing all over the glass. Steady stream of carbonation. Really cannot find any flaws in this.  S-Resinous, piney, hop shot. Well balanced with a caramel malt sweetness.  T-This reminds of a big Rye IPA with some great balance. The hops a re big and aggressive yet not overpowering of the malts. This seems like a big beer with nice complexity, yet it finishes very soft and delicate with brown sugar sweetness.  M-So crisp and refreshing. Huge flavor yet semi-thin body makes it so much easier to enjoy. Wonderful hop presence in the mouth, yet not abrasiveness.  D-Really a great beer all around. Not a whole lot to complain about and this one is worth the hype - good price to boot. Drinks like a much bigger beer but there is enough room to drink more than 1 or 2.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Dalem,3.81,"Dark copper and clear in color with decent size head from a medium pour but quite a bit of lacing though out the entire sipping from the glass. It smells of smoky dark fruits (black cherry and raisin is what I'm thinking), caramel and roasty malt but for the high hop profile it has not much of 'em really show up in the aroma. The flavor is quite complex and much different from what one would think strictly based off the scent. A spicy tart hop kiss touches the taste buds first but a warming molasses & malt thing surrounds it calming down. Somewhere in the middle there's a touch of black tea too. The hops and tea thing do tend to somewhat stick to the roof of the mouth but the finish, especially in the throat, is crisp and clean with a just a slight hop burn coming up as it's down the hatch.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Spidey13,4.08,"First off, I love the way Arrogant Bastard looks. It pours a deep, rich, clear, burnt maroon with a nice tan head that leaves tons of lacing. The nose has lots of juicy, citrussy, candied hops with a bit of grassiness and caramel maltiness underneath.  The taste starts with a bit of sweetness but the hops take over very quickly with spicy notes and a lot of lingering bitterness. Some bready notes also show up on the finish. You can also start to taste the alcohol as the beer nears room temperature. The mouthfeel is nice and full. The bitterness is a bit much if not broken up with some food, which hurts the drinkability a tad.  This is a really good beer, and deserving of its status as one of the classics of the American craft beer scene.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,bound4er,3.49,"My first Stone - this is a good beer (leans towards great at times) but I was expecting more given all the hype. It pours beautifully with a thick, rich head. The nose is pretty muted - mostly a maltiness which surprised me. Nice mouth feel and some classic ale flavors but it is just a touch too bitter for my taste - and I am not afraid of a well hopped beer. Next up on my list is Ruination.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Pauly2X,4.23,"A- Massive two finger head, deep ruby in color.  S- Strong pungent hops atop a solid caramel backbone.  T- Great balance for a strong ale. The hop bitterness is the driving force throughout offset only an almost equally assertive malt backbone which does its best to keep the hops from running a muck. The finish is suprisingly soft and smooth.  M- Slightly fizzy ip front with very smooth finish.  D- Considering the overall strength of this beer it is very drinkable.  Honestly I was hoping to dispell the hype. I have to admit this is a really great beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,lapbplayr,3.85,"It is funny that this beer is labeled as an american strong, becuase I feel it is more like a red, or more exact a double read or an imperial red. Stone starting making this beer before the doubles and imperials were being applied to beer, so there was not a category for it then. I had this beer off of tap and in a 32 oz glass. It looked rather normal, similar to other beers. The aroma is through the roof hoppy and a little like honey from the malts. the taste is very strong bitter on the front end, but leaves smoothly. There is a full bodied mouth feel to this beer, where you will almost gag on it if you have had too much to drink. This is a great beer and I am thankful I live in CA so I can buy this is some grocery stores.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ectomorph,4.6,"I compare all ASA's to this beer.  Poured from the bottle into a tall pilsner glass.  A - Held up to the light, this rich deep ruby/burgundy color is quite nice. Full finger head that LASTS with the lacing that covers every inch...  S - Grapefruit? I swear I smell grapefruit and something else. Really nice, must have taken 10 sniffs and wanted more. ;)  T - The grapefruit again with a great balance to be a 7.2%'er.  M - Great body, not too rich but far from watery.

147,92,charlzm,3.18,"Consumed 07/02/08 at some place I can't remember the name of in Pasadena, CA.  Pours a dark copper/brown. Good carbonation leads to a nice white head with some lacing.  Aroma is not as strong as I remembered; almost nothing there but a subtle hint of citrus hops.  Flavor is equally subdued, with a dark malt character that submerges below a raw, green hop flavor. Bitterness comes on after, but all these flavors are more muted than I remember.  Maybe this was an old keg. And it was served pretty darned cold.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,maximum12,4.46,"Thanks to TexasStout for a bomber of this strong ale a couple of months ago.  Pours with a nice thick head that slowly dissolves into the beer, which is a rusty, murky reddish color. Smells surprisingly of fruit; I wasn't expecting that. Any swirl brings it back to the top. Excellent nose on this Bastard.  Now I see where the Oaked AB (a fantastic beer!) gets its backbone. This is very good. Hopped enough to warrant an IIPA label in my book, with the strong fruits pushed into the background.  Drinkability is high, high, high. I was going to drink this with a nice dinner, but the dinner is still ten minutes in the future & I don't know if this 1/2 of a bomber is going to survive that long.

Big laceing and great retention.  Smell is very good. Like fresh bread out of the oven, with a grain presence. Good creamy buttery sweat malty aroma's, hops are mildly detected in the smell, hop oil? Its mildly grassy.  Up front its sweet buttery cream with a grainy bread like flavor. through the middle the malt comes through with a woosh of grassy hops. So well balanced with malt grain and hops, very rich in flavor. At the swallow the hops come back with the creamy buttery thick mouthfeel. At the swallow its dry in flavor with pine and grassy citrus hops and a good thick body. Afte rthe swallow the hops linger and linger and linger. Oohhh, this one is good. And no, I'm not worthy.

T: A strong hop presence, with citrus/ pine hops up front, which is what I expected, but also bready malt flavors hit you quickly as well. almost a maple syrup sweetness way down in there. Every drink I take seems to highlight a different aspect. Although I expected it to be rather unbalanced, but I really feel it is one of the more balanced beers I've had in awhile. It's certainly well hopped, but good solid malt backbone here, that can really take it. Very tasty indeed.  M: Good level of carbonation. Somewhat thick mouthfeel, but I think it fits with the plan just fine.  D: I will definitely drink this many more times. It is quite assuredly one of the finer beers I have tried in long time. I don't know if this is considered ""extreme"" or not, but for my tastes, it's almost simple, and I sincerely mean that as an absolute compliment.

Smell: Hops are front and center, fruity and piney with a balancing bready malt character along with caramel.  Taste: The beer introduces itself with a surprising smoothness and huge maltiness that includes caramel, chocolate, and a thick biscuity/bready character. Hops then come into the picture, drying things up a bit with a piney and zesty taste. Finish is smooth, thick, and drying. Not for the faint of heart.

147,92,scottg,4.15,"Served in a pint glass at American Flatbread in Burlington, VT.  Pours a clear reddish/brown color with a 1/2 finger creamy head. Extreme aromas of grapefuit, caramel, vanilla, and malt. Complex blend of grapefuit, lemon rind, and carmelized malt with a tea finish. High carbonation, medium body, cleanses the mouth while leaving a chalky mouthfeel. Easy drinkability despite the 7.2%.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,steelerguy,4.63,"A - The beer poured a very nice and clear, dark bown with some copper hues. I could tell just by the way it looked that there was going to be some tasty toasted and caramel malt flavors in there.  S - A nice malty smell with some hop character. I was actually expecting to smell a little more hop but the malt took over. Certainly not a weakness, but I thought the smell was only good.  T - Wow! Now this is what a strong ale should taste like. Nice, strong malt flavors, that fade to be replaced by some tasty esters, and then the hops kick in. I was actually expecting the hops to be over the top, but not at all. The bold and sweet malt flavor completely balance out the strong hop character making it feel perfectly balanced.  M - I really liked the mouthfeel. The carbonation was perfect and the beer was very silky to me as it hit the tongue. Then you would get a slight ""tingle"" as the carbonation and alcohol would play.  D - An extremely drinkable beer. Although no session beer, it is so well balanced that it could almost be one. Although this would not allow you to appreciate it's complexity and could leave you feeling like you got your ass kicked.  Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I actually was thinking it was going to be over the top with all the arrogant marketing and from what I had heard. This was far from what I experienced, it was a very complex and well balanced beer. One that I will certainly be enjoying again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,elniko,4.28,"Poured from bomber into pint glass  A: Poured rich golden amber, finger of head with lacing. Very nice looking brew.  S: For a hoppy ale I did not pick on the hops on the nose. Quite mild in fact.  T & M: Great taste, Stone is an amazing brewery. Floral textures but the bitterness is what is the main aspect of the brew. Mouthfeel excellent as well, this is a brew that lingers after a drink. I am very impressed.  D: Definitely drinkable, although with high alcohol content and the bitterness I don't know how sessionable this brew would be.

147,92,AmishT,4.57,"A - Nice amber color with a nice cream colored head with good retention. Lucid. A fair amount of lacing left behind.  S - Bold dark fruit aromas that are accented by some herbal hops. Love the smell - very strong, pleasant aromas. Some caramel malts also detectable in the background.  T - Very complex flavor. Starts off with dark fruits with a malt backbone. An awesome, complex balanced aftertaste: a butterscotch malt flavor blends brilliantly with the herbal hops. It's a flavor that is really growing on me.  M - A surprisingly clean and refreshing finish. A medium to full body that is chocked full of flavor that's not goin anywhere. Low carbonation that allows the complex flavors to stand out. Great mouthfeel, in my opinion.  D - The style is an American Strong Ale, so it's no surprise the abv is on the high side. The flavors mask the abv exceedingly well...I can definitely feel it though. Like I said, the flavor has really grown on me. The refreshing finish also bolsters the drink. Medium to full body, so it is capable of filling you up, however.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

S: Very interesting and peculiar. Dark fruits (plums, raisins, dark cherries), caramel malts, and a citrus and herbal hop character. Some smoked wood-like characteristics emerge, as well. Robust, complex, and unique.  T&M: Like the smell, taste is highly complex and unique. Roasted caramel malts, barley, and citrus and herbal hops. Alcoholic spiciness adds a tinge of flavor that helps tie the bitter hops and sweeter malts together nicely. Body is medium with a crisp carbonation and a long, lightly bitter finish.  D: Arrogant Bastard is an extreme, complex, and quality beer. The ABV, flavor complexity, and bitter finish limit drinkability somewhat, but it's still a high-quality beer that everyone ought to try at least once.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Jwale73,2.79,"Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a translucent mahogany; excellent clarity. Rocky, off-white head. Good retention that eventually coalesced into a dollop of white in the center. Head was reconstituted with a light swirl and completely refreshed with each pour. Scent of hops, hops and more hops, as well as a hint of pine and citrus that lent a medicinal quality to the nose. Also thought I detected some dark-skinned fruit in there. Taste was consistent with nose and flavors seemed a bit muddled. Lingering bitterness between quaffs left a bad taste in my mouth. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and lightly effervescent with a mild burn up front. Bottle was right; I didn't like this one. Not at all what I expected.

There's a slight oxidized quality present, leading me to assume this bottles a bit on the older side. Dark fruits smelling of golden raisins. Pine-scented, woody hops.  Taste: Toasty, bready malts with a medium sweetness and taste of brown sugar. Slight dark fruitiness. Hoppy pine wood flavor, a bit of fresh mint.

It has a very nice, dark golden body with reddish highlights, and a luscious tan head that lasts a very long time, leaving good lacing on its way down. Aroma is a very pleasant and well balanced combination of malty sweetness, caramel mostly, and a fresh hoppiness that is mostly made of citrusy and piney aromas. Firm body, richly malted with a load of caramel which is very well balanced by a nice hoppy bitterness; it is still weighted towards the bittering hops, but the caramel keeps coming back for more. Fruity and earthy notes make cameo appearances from time to time. Easy to drink, another amazing Stone that it took way too long for me to try it for the first time; but certainly not the last.

Citrusy smell. Very fruity and malty. I seriously spent a while just smelling it before I tasted it.  Taste- First thing that hits you it a bit of hoppy citrusy bitterness but then it is balanced out with a really nice carmely malt taste. After you swallow it it leaves a bit of a bitter taste in your mouth, but not bitter in a bad way. Kind of like after you eat something very citrusy.  Really excellent beer overall.

Some citrus and a malty backbone with big caramel notes.  Taste is very nice, but I think I actually prefer the oaked. A bitter hoppiness that is sort of missing a distinct profile. Perhaps it's just elluding me. A strong malt backbone.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crisp carbonation bite.  Drinkability is moderate as alcohol is moderate and flavors are good.

147,92,biboergosum,4.33,"22oz bomber. I first ran into this bad boy at a gas station (!) in Sandpoint, Idaho. There it was, sitting in a standard cooler next to the gargantuan BMC offerings - the anti-marketing on the label had me at ""bastard"". Unfortunately, that first bottle was consumed out of a hotel room tumbler, with predictable results - under-appreciation and a fuzzy subsequent stroll by the lake front.  Anyways, now, poured into an American pint glass, this beer exhibits a clear, dark-hued red brick amber colour, with two fingers of densely foamy, rocky, and yet soapy-looking beige head, which disappears at a measured pace, eventually leaving some splendid roiling sea froth lace around the glass. This beer even looks mean.  It smells primarily of semi-sweet, bready caramel malt, biscuity toffee, molasses, besotted raisins, root beer syrup, and a bitter orange cream and pine resin hop essence lurking just under the surface. The taste is big and malty, to be sure - dark fruit-tinted caramel and toffee abound, but the oily pine and citrusy hop bitterness asserts itself well, aggressively, to teeteringly balance things out, over the lesser, but not forgotten brown sugar and earthy root notes.  The carbonation is quite moderate, the body a sturdy medium-heavy weight, and so-so smooth - y'know, sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. It finishes off-dry - malty, oh yeah, but still duly assaulted by a wayward hop bitterness. The elevated alcohol is a general no-show, until you're nearing the end of the bottle, and then you start to clue in.  A wonderful, beefed-up ale, one which will put metaphoric hair where there wasn't any before, as evidenced by my girlfriend ceding me her share of the bottle, in exchange for some relatively 'tame' strong Belgian ale, after a mere few sips. And due to its all around, in-your-face nature - one serving at a time would be plenty (trying not to mouth the words as I re-read this).",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The head is incredibly sticky and has great retention. This beer looks amazing.  S: Big, bold, spicy hops with a touch of floral. Caramel and malt are there too. Smells pretty good.  T: The spiciness of the hops hit you first. This beer has bite, but it is a good bite. Caramel and lightly roasted malt balance the bitterness and spiciness. There is an almost resin aftertaste with a touch of spicy fruits. Still a bit crazy on the palate but that is what they are going for.  M: Very well balanced creaminess with a medium carbonation. This beer is in no way thin. Coats the mouth and keeps the flavors lingering. A little heat on the back of the throat.  D: This is a fine beer that can easily be enjoyed.

Tastes fairly sweet and robust with huge notes of caramel, toasted and roasted malts and it finishes with a huge dose of spicy and citric pine like hops. Loads of hops flavour in this offering, very spicy hops lend a perfect balance to the huge malty start.

The beer has minor translucence, making it almost clear. Exploding to the surface is a thick, billowing, cream-colored head with excellent retention and heavy lacing.  Smell: There is a balancing act between a spicy hop aroma and a sweet caramel malt aroma. The hops tip the balance slightly it their favor.  Taste: A very smooth, sweet, and subtle flavor up front characterizes this beer. Then, out of seemingly nowhere, is a swift tongue numbing kick to the face of bitter hop goodness. The aftertaste is dry with miniscule traces of pine flavor which comfortably fade.  Mouthfeel: Contrary to the massive head, there is minimal carbonation. Despite this fact, the body is on the lighter side.  Drinkability: The lighter body makes this an easy drinker. However, the strong bitterness makes it a worthwhile sipper.

Also, the yeast peeks through, making this brew far more interesting than your average hop monster.

Backed by a interesting malty foundation... reminded me of toasted, almost burnt nuts... walnuts, cashews... just very rich complex roasted tastes... but not sweet or overwhelming.  Mouthfeel feels substantial... but not syrupy, just alot of flavor. Benefits from warming a tad bit to unearth some of those other flavors.

It is very hoppy, a little more than I like, but it didn't overpower the malt, which still came through. Fruity esters come through pretty strong, but are not off-putting at all.

Or trying to find the elusive cheap drinkable macro lager so I don't go broke. I've come to love big beers. big malty beers, or big hoppy beers, something out of the mainstream. this is a definite favorite.  Someone at Stone decided to cram as much malt and hops, and more hops, as possible into this one, with excellent results.

Other slight smells appear as it warms yet none significant enough to contend.  Taste, of course, Hops. Now its not all hops but boy does it hit you out of the gate.

Taste & mouthfeel: An utterly unique and instantly recognizable combination of caramel and toasted malt flavors and intensely bitter resiny/earthy hops.

The taste is ""one-of-a-kind""; when it first enters you think, ""heavy stuff"", and this may turns some off like a motor-oil-thick imperial stout. Thereafter, the hops sting your palette with freshness and the date-raisin-sweet malt flavors reacts to your palette, finished off with a creamy head making it smooth as is the mouthfeel; yet after 8 oz. of this, I was realizing how difficult it would be to finish it off; its a great sign of craft, but still limits the drinkability.

I might have enjoyed it more if I had not been having it with food, and if it were my first beer of the evening rather than my 3rd and final one. Appearance is surprisingly red and head is sturdy. Aroma is serious hoppiness (with some nice fruity under-tones) and a substantial maltiness that comes across as to me as metallic, caramel-y, and bitter in a non-hoppy way.

S - Immediate hop aroma followed by a little spiciness, but mainly hops hops and more hops.  T - HUGE flavor right from the start with the immediate bitterness from the hops but mellows out and the true arrogance shines through. It also becomes more complex as it warms, I don't know what the suggested serving temperature is from Stone but a bit below room temperature def. seems best as the beer opens up a lot.  M - Very smooth on the palate, kind of like an IPA, and definitely a heavy beer feel from the high alcohol content.  D - This beer promotes longevity when you drink it. I don't know if I could possibly drink it quickly because of the way it's crafted. Very easy to sip on all through the night...or day.

Now I just need to find somewhere on the East Coast that sells it on tap....",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,nasty15108,4,"Poured form a 1pt 6oz bottle into a pint glass.  A - Reddish-brown color reminiscent of strong iced tea. The pour produced an off-white head that quickly gave way to a bubbly film. Spotty lacing throughout.  S - Malty, hoppy aroma. I definitly detected pine, grapefruit and butter in there. Very complex and intriguing.  T - The sweet maltiness and good amount of hop bitterness keep this ale well balanced. The presence of citrus and the high alcohol content give the finish a slight bite.  MF&D - Medium to full bodied ale. The oiliness of the hops really coated my mouth well and the malty sweetness made this one a lip smacker.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Offa,4.45,"This is a nicely strong, slightly rough but delicious, complex, full-bodied beer.  It has a deep red body with a big, off-white head that slowly shrinks and leaves some good lacing.  The aroma is flowery pine, citrus (esp. grapefruit), caramelly malt.  The flavour is strong and rich with a lot of malty-caramelly sweetness offsetting the strong hoppy bitterness. It has citrus and pine flavours. It just maintains the balance to avoid being harsh.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,hyland24,4.45,"Poured from a bomber into a pilsner glass. Drank this with the brew crew Moxley and Pleepleus.  A- Poured heavy settling to a dark brown amber with a huge thick firm off white head with sticky thick spider web lacing that stuck to the glass like concrete. Beautiful looking beer.  S- Heavy, heavy malt. The thick malt smell is all over this one followed by delicious toffee, nutty smell with hints of pine.  T- Similar to the smell with heavy malt followed by pancake syrup sweetness. Really impressed by the flavor of this one.  MF&D- Medium to full bodied especially for an ale. Coats the mouth well leaving leaving behind a nice sticky feel. Does not taste anywhere near its 7.2 ABV so beware. Stop reading this review immediately and go out and by a bunch of these bastards.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,indiapaleale,4.23,"Pours a nice dark mahogany color with a beautiful yellowish head that quickly takes up the space at the top quarter of my glass. Its a sight to behold really, such a rich color in a liquid and such a perfectly formed head on its top. The head is tight and slowly begins to leave little islands of foam floating atop this inviting elixir.  The smell is arrogant. Well, not really. Its more like super fresh, piney hops that almost sting your nose. Its slightly grassy mixed with hints of malt sweetness mixed with the acidic bitterness of citrus, both orange and grapefruit.  First taste is sharp! Its astringent, its hoppy, its got some serious bite! It slowly becomes smoother and provides that nice hop fix that draws me to beers like this. The hop bite and the alcohol warming are a nice combo. There is not a lot of malt backbone to the Arrogant Bastard, but you know what? Who cares? It doesn't need to be a well balanced example of anything. Its supposed to be what it says it is...aggressive!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Moxley,4.61,"Enjoyed a nice 3-way tasting with fellow BA members Pleepleus and Hyland24. I'd love to get nasty one day.  A - A first time drinker of this beer may think it will over flow when pouring it into a glass, but this arrogant bastard magically forms a perfect deep amber body with a thick 1 ½ inch tan head leaving you feeling like you truly are not worthy to drink this beer. And let me not forget to mention the heavy, heavy, doily-like lacing that dominates the walls of the glass until the bitter sweet end.  This is a mother fuckin' good lookin' beer. I'd give this one a 10 if that were an option. Immediately reminded me of the way Guinness looks as its swirling, opaque-black body forms its perfect head.  S - Lots of malty sweetness with a strong maple, toffee aroma and nutty undertones.  T - Nice balanced malt flavor with a bitter sweet finish. Also picked up on some coffee nuances thanks to Pleepleus' seasoned beer palate.  M&D - Thick and creamy and seriously smooth. Minimal carbonation, perfectly balanced body. Hyland24 makes a very good observation - it's quite heavy for an ale and you certainly wouldn't guess you were drinking a beer with a 7.2 ABV.  So, unless you want to become an arrogant bastard please drink responsibly.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Pleepleus,4.17,"Enjoyed this Arrogant Bastard with fellow BA members Hyland and Moxley. While selecting a few beers for us to sample, I must admit the clever name and the Demon on the bottle played a big part in choosing this one.  Poured from a bomber into a pilsner glass, was an adventure in itself. It looked as if the pourer had made some error and the head would overflow the glass and just as it was about to get ugly it settled and came together perfectly. The heavy head joined the liquid like a Guinness pour on speed and what was foam on top quickly joined the beer on bottom. It had a chesnut brown color and a half inch of head with heavy lacing. The smell was a mellow maple malt. It had a maple fruity taste with a bittersweet aftertaste, almost like coffee but not so strong. Was heavy bodied for an ale, but in a good way. A well balanced tasty treat, delicious to the last drop. Need to keep in mind the 7.2 APV because I don't get a stong alcohol flavor and I could definately have a few of these.

They've managed to not cross a line into something offensive, instead coming out with a bold and wonderful brew. Citrus peel, some pine essence, and a little bit of a malty backbone rounding it all out  M: Great here... oily, and a little fuller than medium ody. Great to swish around through the mouth the savour the flavours.  D: Tasty enough to deserve another. A little more subtle than its oaked brother, and perhaps my personal preference.

S - Potent, dense, malty and a distant fruit taste - almost like raisins and caramel forced on top of each other. This beer wants you to know you are about to drink it.  T - Heavy and malty and dense. The aftertaste I got from it was unpleasant, almost salty. Call me one of the unworthy.  M - Creamy and heavy, it sticks on your tongue for a while.

147,92,RickSawyer,4.19,"Pours ruby brown with a mahogany heart. Tight, compact white head slides down to an atoll around the glass. Smell is piney, resiny sap with some tangerine zest and backed up by a sweet, bready caramel malt background. Taste is very refreshing. Sort of similar to a bigfoot without the creamed mouthfeel. Hits the front of the tounge with sweet, toasted raisin bread, hints of maple syrup, all quickly balanced out across the tongue with a bit of piney hop. Finishes clean and dry, not to heavy on the mouthfeel. Refreshing.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Smells of pine, maybe hints of grapefruit, and I get some grass. Not fresh cut grass, but grass you smell when your out in the field playing some baseball. Makes me think of my little league days. Nice hop profile balanced with a great malt backbone. Nice long finish. Pretty arrogant brew. Does a good job of ripping through my tongue but I am loving it. Incredibly smooth and easy to drink.

It was still more robust than a typical IPA, and it had a good, clean hops flavor with some malt. But it didn't have as much flavor, and it wasn't as well-balanced as the Rogue.

I finally found it bottled and decided to give it my utmost attention.  I smelled it first in the bottle because I couldn't wait, and my mouth is watering.  Pours a deep, dark amber with a pillowy off-white head.  Smells of huge amounts of piney hopsand bright citrus notes. If only I could find a cologne with a similar smell, I'd probably spend many a night home alone :)  Taste is sweet and bright with a powerful hops bite at the very end.  I'm in love with this beer.

The aroma is very nicely balanced with a good amount of malt to support the hops. The taste much like the aroma is very nicely balanced. The hops definitely holds the spotlight in this brew, but the malt holds its own providing a very nice backbone. Overall, this is a very enjoyable brew that is extremely well balanced but features enough of a kick to satisfy any hop fix. If this were available here, I would Arrogant Bastard by the case.

That's pretty much all I can smell at first. Then as it warms up, call me crazy, but I swear I smell raspberry. Just a hint of it. Very aromatic beer.  T - The hops smack me right in the tongue at first and my reaction is ""what a hoppy beer!"" I wasn't that impressed with my first sip because of the overpowering hops, but as the beer warms more characteristics come out. Towards the end of the glass, if I breath in my nose and take a sip at the same time I can smell and taste a little bit of the raspberry. Notes of caramel as well in the aftertaste.

It's INCREDIBLY sticky and foamy, and both the lacing and the head don't go anywhere. At all. Most excellent.  Smell: Deep, sugary fruits - plums, and mild citrus - a piney hop presence, sweet and toasted grains, and alcohol. Oy. Very pungent.  Taste: I feel arrogant drinking this beer. It's rich and full, and the grainy malts are both sweet and caramelly, as well as smoky and rustic. The alcohol is warming and pungent and its spicy presence is noticeable throughout the body. There's also an assertive, sharp, juniper and citrus hop presence. So good.  Mouthfeel: Pure heavy, rich, thick, creamy velvet. Stellar.  Drinkability: Maybe it's just the arrogance talking, but this beer is definitely a sipping beer, to be appreciated and puzzled over. I'm discovering new tastes and aromas as I take each new sip. Not eminently drinkable, if only because of it's formidable alcohol character.  A rich, complex, and satisfying ale, almost a wine in many ways. There are more flavors and aromas here than I can begin to count, and my grasp of the english language isn't firm enough to describe all the sensations this beer brings about.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

It has a slightly heavy body, but is definitely drinkable. With your first taste you get the wonderful citrus piney hop flavor on your palate and then it mellows out and the bitterness flows through leaving a nice crisp finish.

I don't know how they make a beer with such complex taste and avoid a food fight from all the ingredients. It starts with the toasted flavors, giving way to orange and lemon peels, and some mild pepper. There are hints of other fruits as well, such as Granny Smith apples. The finish is smoother, with caramel and some more bitter citrus flavors. Very intense taste yet still very refreshing.

This was a hard one to pin down but hints of floral and citrus come to mind, a bit of sweetness that is more like sugar cane than cotton candy. T. Robust hops and malt, almost felt I was taking a bite of the brew like a hunk of Squaw bread but more fruity hoppy tang as promised by the nose. M. Refreshing and comforting to swirl across the palate with warm alcohol of warmness as it went down the gullet. D. Very drinkable but not a session beer.

Lots of carbonation here - body is very clean, with a color that's somewhere between red brick, lava-lamp red and, for those Buffalonians out there, a slight tinge of Loganberry! WTF?! Looks a little more industrial-strength than expected, but a solid package nonetheless.  Aroma is soapy floral hops. That's pretty much what I'm picking up here. Not a bad thing.  The hops balance nicely in taste with alcohol and mellow, dark, caramel malt - maybe a little grassiness and sour cherries show up, too. Nice stuff.  Very clean on the mouth for a style - robust enough to sooth, tanginess from the hops and cherries for a little puckering sensation. Carbonation more present in appearance and does not detract from the mouthfeel at all.  This is probably a lot more drinkable than expected for the alcohol content.

These hops remind me of beeswax flavored with orange zest. I've noticed this flavor in a few other beers that I've had. It fits nicely you should try it on. Fresh clover, when I was a wee lad I used to pick clover and pull out the purple tops of the blossom and suckle the white ends of them for the nectar. This beer reminds me of the flavor, and I think that's pretty amazing. Today I didn't give her a five because its a bit bitter for me. But this is one of the best beers in the world in my opinion.

147,92,abankovich,4.25,"Appearance - Poured a very deep amber with about a 2 finger head that started to dissipate after a few sips. Some of the head clung to the side of the glass and a light layer stayed on top.  Smell - Caught a little sweetness among the aromas, a little caramel, but mostly smelled the hops, slightly sour.  Taste - Initial taste on my tongue was the strong taste of the hops, bitter, but they faded to a sweet, slightly chocolate, smoky finish on the back end that lingers long after it has gone down.  Mouthfeel - I wouldn't call it incredibly heavy but it's definitely on the mid to heavy end of the spectrum. Pretty smooth going down considering how aggressive (as it says on the bottle) this beer is.  Drinkability - Definitely not a beer for people unaccustomed to the style. It is strong and full of flavor but an excellent beer. Not the easiest to have multiple bottles of because it only comes in 22oz servings.  This is a great beer, as most Stone beers that I've had have proven to be. The 7.2% ABV doesn't really show through much at all. Definitely something that I try and always have on hand in my fridge.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,maddogruss,4,"A: Pours a dark brown body with a one inch, tan head. Excellent retention until the finish of the beer with solid lacing along the sides of the glass.  S: Smells like sweet grapefruit with some bitter, floral undertones.  T: A strong, hop taste with a sweet, dry grapefruit aftertaste. Slightly bitter, but balanced out by the sweet, grapefruit taste.  M: Fairly full-bodied and smooth. A little thin, but overall, still nice and smooth.  D: Definitely a drinkable beer. An excellent balance of hops and malts. The hops are more evident in the beginning, but become much more balanced out towards the finish.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,JDV,3.13,"Pour is reddish brown with a light head. Smell is malty sweetness, with some hops showing through. Taste is sweet but not overly at all, followed by a mild drying hop finish. Thich, and rich for the style, while flavors are somewhat mild actually. Nice bitterness at first, but it turned medicinal and aspirin tablet-like a bit. Not bad, but wasn't too crazy about it either.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,clayrock81,4.15,"Poured the bomber bottle into a pint glass and was presented with a 2-finger head that was very foamy and died slowly, leaving little lacings on top of a seethru ruby brown body. The smell was very hoppy and some malt characters were noticeable, and I picked up some earth tones. The smells are mostly strong and pointed also, not weak hints. To me, as hoppy as Stone Brewing likes to make their beers this was very malty. You will notice the hops and some of the alcohol (it is 7.2% ABV) in the backbite, but it still remains a heavy body that goes down smooth. However, the driving force behind this brew is the mixture of coffee, roasted, chocolate and toffee malts that blend well together. I might be missing one or adding one, but this is somewhat strong stout tasting, malt wise, balanced with hops for a strong, dry finish that keeps you wanting more. One of the few ales with a ""higher-than-session"" ABV that had me continually tilting my glass and I could've kept pounding these bad boys. The fact that they're $4 or $5 at grocery stores only adds to this beer. The label's right - not for beer wimps.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Pours a beautiful deep mahogany with a creamy off white head that dissipates slowly leaving a nice foamy cap and modest lacing.  Fairly balanced nose of caramel malt and hops.  Taste is impressive with a smooth malt profile intermingled with the hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium to full and very smooth, a lush and easy drinking brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Drinkability ok this is a once in a while beer.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Overlord,4.05,"Not my favorite from Stone, but a damn fine beer.  Pours a reddish amber. Smells like caramel malt, citrus/grapefruit, and pine hops. The taste is mostly caramel malt with a real pine hop background. The citrus is much more biting than I'm used to from ales of this type.  Nice thick mouthfeel. For some reason, I've just never appreciated this beer as much as I should. I always find myself grabbing the oaked version, double bastard, or ruination instead. Solid, pleasing product.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Very delicious and strong up front, and mellows quickly with a bit of bitterness. A nice strong beer that would be great with a solid steak.  M: Not as heavy of a beer for it's taste. Sits with nice carbonation on the tongue.

147,92,EagleAg,4.83,"I had heard alot about this beer from some of my buddies and said I had to try it if I liked flavorful beers. It certainly did not disappoint.  The beer poured a deep amber, reddish color with nice head the faded slowly and left a nice lacing down the glass.  The smell of hops was evident along with a slight sweetness. There is a fruitiness that comes through as well.  The taste is bold to say the least. The first thing that hit me was the almost overwhelming sense of hops but it transforms into a slightly sweet caramel flavor. As you drink it the hops tone seems to dissapate a little to let you get some of the more delicate undertones that are missed on the first drink.  This is a lightly carbonated and feels rich in your mouth. Very smooth and gets smoother as you drink it.  Definitely lives up to its warning that this is not for the carbonated macro brew drinkers. This will definitely be something I get again and again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Gehrig,4.45,"The label is funny, issuing a tongue-in-cheek challenge to drinkers to dare to declare themselves worthy of such a product. Upon trying it, I have to say that this beer holds up its end of the bargain. Much to discuss.  Two fingers of tan froth top a copper body with crimson tinges that's very easy on the eye. The smell brings loads of caramel to the nose, but is sufficiently complex to allow for fruit to present itself. Combined with the malt, this continues to please.  As does the taste, Arrogant Bastard sends the message that it means business. The caramel is very pleasant, but not too sweet, and combines with the fruit very nicely. I was surprised at the rather dry aftertaste, which doesn't go well with the rest in my humble opinion. Yet this is a very good and worthy brew, more than worth trying but worth its weight in gravitas. This beer has nerve and lives up to its braggadoccio. Well done.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,dsa7783,4.13,"A while back, I had sampled Stone's Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale, and really enjoyed the extreme flavor... the brewery's original ale is just as good, if not better, in my opinion... absolutely amazing dark-copper, prune-colored appearance with a gigantic frothy and foamy head that almost obliterated my drinking glass... smell was replete with caramel and bitter hops along with a tinge of vanilla... strange how the taste strongly complemented the aroma with honey flavors, caramel, strong hops, bitter florals, and slight vanilla... the flavor is truly extreme, aggressive and dominating... the strong ale flavored is extremely loaded with hops and a strong taste that completely dominates the pallate and doesn't let go... this has to be one of the most dominating and extreme American brews... definitely not for the faint-of-heart... really thick and rich stuff... if you like stronger, full-flavored beers, this one is definitely recommended...",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

T - A text book American Strong Ale. Sweet caramel upon entry. Lightly sweet flavor hops that fall into good bittering hops follow. Again, not the most complex beer I've ever had, some interesting fruit notes towards the swallow, but very enjoyable.  M - Full, enjoyable, no complaints again.  D - This goes down so well.

147,92,dnichols,3.85,I poured a capped bottle into a large chilled mug.  A: It poured a ruddy brown with ruby hues and a sticky two finger tank head consisting of varied sized bubbles. The thick head lingered and left a dense curtain.  S: There were rich aromas of floral hops and sweet lightly roasted malts that gave of ripe fruit odors and hints of brown sugar.  T: There was the signature Stone balance profile of hops and malts. The malts present a nice sweet front that gives way to a moderately bitter back. despite a healthy ABV the finish is bitter with hints of malty sweetness.  M: It was smooth and creamy with a moderate body and bitter aftertaste that does not inhibit the next sip.  D: It was a bit over hopped and bitter for my taste but great craftsmanship is hard to hide...this is a well put together brew that merits great respect.

Aromas are grassy hops with sweet malts in the background. Also a woody scent. Hint of the alcohol.  The taste is great. Very bitter and hoppy with enough malt to backbone to hold it all together. Hops are piney and also citrus. A slight chalky aftertaste, and very dry.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is good.

Lighter than expected aroma with caramel, toasted malts, and citrus hops.  Starts nice and malty with caramel, toasted bread, and biscuit flavors. Hops overtake the malt with a big dose of pine, cirtus, and lots of grapefruit. Hops are not harsh, and this beer has great complexity and depth of flavor. I really enjoy how it starts malty and fades to hoppy. Finishes dry with lingering alcohol spice.  Medium in body, rich, smooth, and chewy.

The taste is hoppy & bitter, as I expect from a California ale, but not overly so...as in a Sierra Nevada product (which for me is almost undrinkable). There is an underlying sweetness to the finish, which resembles apples & pears...and somewhat acidic as such. It's also spicy like the food region from which it originates. Some caramel & cinnamon going on here too. I can see why this ale is so popular, there are alot of different flavors going on...the bitter, sweet & spicy all complement each other.

Smooth and creamy with a burnt caramel taste and a punch of hops. You can feel the booze, but it's not in your face like you'd think. Well balanced by the malt.

Stone's label are always great, but this may be my favorite: A menacing gargoyle holds a pint on the front and on the back:  ""Arrogant bastard Ale: This is an aggressive beer. You probably won't like it. It is quite doubtful that you have the taste or sophistication to able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth. We would suggest that you stick to safer and more familiar territory --- maybe something with a multi-million dollar ad campaign aimed at convincing you it's made in a little brewery, or one that implies that their tasteless fizzy yellow beer will give you more sex appeal. Perhaps you think multi-million dollar ad campaigns make a beer taste better. Perhaps you're mouthing words as you read this.""  Perfect beer for my BA Initiation.  a: Deep and hazy reddish brown body, cream colored head and excellent lacing.  s: Caramel toasted malt makes an appearance, but the aroma is mainly hops.  t: Biscuity malts are noticeable but are quickly swept aside as the hops takeover. Great depth of flavor. The hops are raw and display notes of pine, citrus, and flowers.  m: A rich, sticky, chewy beer, though the body isn't too full. Good carbonation. Wraps itself around your tongue and invades your taste buds, don't think I'll be tasting my diner tonight.  d: Its a great beer, but being the arrogant SOB that it is, I wouldn't want to mess with more than one.

The brew looks walnut brown until held to a light revealing deep cherry red... pretty for sure.  Aroma is a good balance between American hops and caramel and toasted malts... some fruitiness.. more refined than previous years notes reveal.  Full flavored obviously.. citrus and pine hops shine but are shadowed perfectly buy the big malt flavors... bitterness is less that remembered but still very nice. Leans toward the sweet side with caramel and toasty malts... a touch of milk chocolate is highlted by the sorta creamy mouthfeel. Big and brash across the board..

I really should buy it more often... but the rational side of me always says ""the AB will always be here.. try something different.""

Still very good, but not as insanely hoppy as I thought it was.  Appearance is a nice dark brown almost reddish color with a huge three finger head. It smells great with a strong hoppy, floral and sweet aroma. This ale is clean and fresh tasting with plenty of hops, however there is less residual bitterness than in Stone IPA. The hoppy freshness is balanced with some malty sweetness and hints of toastiness. There is some fruity (perhaps grapefruit rind?) taste mixed in there as well. While there is a significant hoppy character to this brew, it is a delicious beer I could drink often. There is no need to be intimidated by the label or the name, if you enjoy Sierra Nevada Pale Ale or Liberty Ale you will probably like this one as well.

T: Very bitter, lots of hops flavors, but a pleasant sweet citrus finish and aftertaste. Definitely some alcohol flavor present as well. Not as aggressive as the back of the bottle would suggest. I throughly enjoyed it.  M: Perfect. Carbonation is right on. Not watered down but not too thick for an ale.

I want to first start off by saying the smack talk on the bottle was a little annoying and made me think it was a queer gimmick or something. Also, and I had to laugh but the bottle decorations are embedded with ""cadmium"" which is highly TOXIC!! It should be called Dumb Ass Bastard!! Any-who...  A - Pours a dark robust amber with a thick head that lasted...  S - Rich malt with strong hop presents. The strong combination made this really make a statement. Floral grains were abundant with light citrus background notes.  T - Very Piney up front with pungent hop overtones. Sort of classic comparisons to traditional ESB's but a bit tangier than most. Very nice follow with a malty finish.  M - Full bodied and a bit sticky on the palette. Not a clean finish but very tasty, almost like a meal within itself.  D - Very respectable brew, I'll look for this one more often. My buddy said it was an extreme but not so much for me.

Initial tasting gives as impression of a big malty ale with a touch of booziness and toastiness and apple. Definitely on the richer side, but dry enough to avoid being cloying, and with the hop flavour to stave off too heavy a maltiness.  I think this achieves a nice balance between maltiness and hops, and is no doubt quite a bit bitterer (objectively) than the impression it gives. Quite drinkable for such a big beer.

An aggressive pour left a 2 finger creamy light-tan head lasting with some good lace all around.  S - Bright hops, fresh. Full sweetness of pineapple, pear, and some yeast. A pretty tame and soft nose for the experience to come.  T - Intensely bitter from start to finish, masking the apparent complexity of the beer. By about the 8th sip my mouth is acclimated to the bitterness, becoming somewhat numb to the intensity, revealing a very appealing and tasty ale. Some hints of pine are met with fruity grapefruit and raspberry tartness, along with a surprising amount of roasted malt, somewhat dry and dark. the intense hops keep it bright with a lot of depth, accomplished with very little sweetness. It's now 2 minutes after my last sip and I'm still discovering flavors I hadn't noticed before.  M - Complex - slightly dry with a hoppy oil feel. Fairly medium bodied, difficult to discern from the bitterness.  D - Okay. So complex it becomes intriguing. This is one elusive beer, hiding itself beneath folds of hop and bitterness.

Here goes...I humble myself..  Dark hazy, redish amber...Frothy head looks almost like foam on a cappicino, excellent retention and lacing. Smell of molasses, vanilla, chamomile, citrus, fresh cut hay and pine...complex...yes. Taste the hops, this is what they're about and what they're good at....pine, citrus combined with a toasted malty fruitiness, reminiscent of molasses, dried cherries, pineapple, raisins, that takes this brew in a most interesting flavor direction along with a creamy but carbonated bite that makes for a inticing mouthfeel and drinkability.

147,92,Homerbag,4.28,"Murky Copper red with one the best heads out there. The head lasts until the very end. If you are into visual stimulating beers, this has to be on your list.  Nice aroma balance of strong hop and roasted grains. Some alcohol is present but burried under the fruitiness of the yeast.  Hoppy from the get go. Almost IPA hoppy. Sweet malty grains balance of the hard hop kick. Good fruity undertone that adds complexity to a very outstanding flavor.  Feel is the only place that this does not overly impress. Good carbonation and enough viscosity to let the flavor soak in but leaves clean aftertaste for a beer this strong.  This is a very goog beer and I wish it was more availible in the upper midwest. This is a very good example of the style and I hope to enjoy it again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Pours deep redish copper with a good size head that laces nicely to the glass. Aroma of bready malt and huge hop additions. Interesting mouthfeel from all those bitter hops.

Very sticky, just hugs the glass.  Very rough hops nose. Grains, and alcohol are also very present but not overpowering. Balance and lovely.  Nice full body. Very rich, very complex brew. Smooth considering the amounts of hops. Malty sweetness that immediately gets cut down by the hops. The alcohol really comes through when this one warms up. The raw hops palate is very complex, the brewers must have used a million different styles in this one. Finishes very sweet and dry but taste great from start to finish.  Just a side note: this brew is not for the faint of heart. It's big, complex, very raw, and very sophisticated. You need to know what you're getting into before you buy it. If you don't like hops don't get it, if you don't like big brews don't get... if you dare.

Big citrus and pine hops in the smell. Also present is a bit of a caramel aroma.  Taste: Sweet citrus hops lead off the sip along with some maltiness and then quickly transitions to the piney hop flavor that rounds out the swallow.  Mouthfeel: Decent thickness and finishes clean and hoppy. You get a big blast of pine hops that sticks around for a long while after the sip. Also, although there is not a relatively low ABV, you get a bit of a nice warming feeling in your throat.  Drinkability: A beer that has such a strong, long lasting hop flavor is not something you could drink a ton of.

147,92,ncvbc,4.22,"While I think I enjoy this more than the Oaked, it isn't as balanced or rounded out. Needless to say, I'm a hop head so I'll take all the bitter I can get. Basically looks the same as the oaked, pretty close to brown in color and an off white head. Decent lacing and steady carbonation. Smell is great and the hops come through much more here than in the Oaked. The smell in general is much bigger. Hops, hops, and more hops with a pretty big malty backbone that consists of caramel and toasted biscuits. Taste doesn't quite live up to the smell but tries to follow the same suit. I prefer the Oaked in terms of taste simply because the vanilla flavors help to round it out in a good way. Mouthfeel here is fairly bitter and dry. Medium bodied and a good tingle from the carbonation on the tongue but slick. I could drink a good bit of this. A couple bombers would do me good. Pretty much exactly what I remember from a tasting in Asheville and it remains a solid selection in my book.

Awesome hop aroma.  A thrashing amount of citrus and bittersweet hops make for quite a bold taste. Earthy, piney, resiny. A welcomed kick in the palate with this ale.  The mouthfeel is soft and creamy, yet still decently carbonated.

Color is a deep reddish brown. Smells of malts, hops, and earthy nuts. The taste reminds me of a strong brown ale or nut ale. I likened it to Samuel Adam's Brown Ale, but this beer is much better.

Average head of about 1.5 inches in my glass and crystal clear for a darker beer.  Smell: The best aroma from a beer I've ever experienced. Pure citrus and grapefruit with something at that trails off the harder you breathe in that I can't pinpoint.  Taste: Much like the smell: pure grapefruit. If I were given this beer in a blind taste test I don't know if I would be able to tell between this and grapefruit juice itself. Still, there is a hint of alcohol and malt but very unorthodox for a beer. It's maybe a little weak for something called ""Arrogant Bastard Ale"" at only 7.2 % alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Light and acidic. Again, unorthodox. Very tangy, but you don't get sick of it.  Drinkability: I could drink more than a couple of these without getting tired of it.

Some citric notes, mainly pineapple with a touch of hops and some sweetness too. An almost chocolate taste as it goes down.

It was OUTSTANDING. M= When it hit my mouth, it was very heady, but also very nice feeling. D= I am a lightweight, so I can only drink a couple of these at a time before I get my butt kicked.

Bitter hop on top, resinous pine on pine action, some fruity but not floral underneath, but you have to dig for it.  T: bit caramel and sweet malt stands out with the massive hop fighting for your attention. Semi-dry finish that bitter but the sweetness if trying to fight through but dying in the effort.

Won't go away. Aggressive.  D: for me, no worries. It could be a very overwhelming beer for some, and unique compared to a double red or a DIPA. Some of the integration of taste that is come along for DIPAs is completely absent here, and just big on big fighting it out, and you need to be ok with that to have it linger in your mouth. If not, lower this score.  Overall: I'm a bit nostalgic about this beer, as a draft of this in California was really my introduction to extreme beer.

147,92,MikefromDormont,4.03,"Arrogant Bastard was my introduction to Stone Brewing. We had never heard of Stone Brewing until a few years ago. At that time my friends and I spotted a bottle of this beer sitting on the shelf in Washington DC's Chevy Chase Wine and Liquors. The silkscreen gargoyle and the ""You're Not Worthy"" statement caught our attention and made this beer a must buy, just for its packaging. After tasting several bottles of this beer, I am sure happy that we decided to try this beer. It's my opinion that this beer is not for every beer drinker.  The beer poured dark brown with hints of ruby showing. There was a tan head and bits of yeast ""floaties"" suspended in my glass. I was expecting an onrush of hop flavors, but was surprised that I initially greeted with a sweet malt flavor. However, the hops soon dominated the beer's flavor and the finish was bitter. This beer was full bodied and had a smooth, oily mouth feel.

A mildly toasty character finishes it off.  T - Very robust and potent yet managable profile with an apparent alcohol flavor. A bit of hops show through in the aftertaste, and I swear I can pick up a bit of caramel as well. Mellows out a bit as it warms.  M - Full bodied yet has a surprisingly clean finish.

This is what beer should taste like. From there the hops creep up your tongue and do a little dance on your taste buds. After you swallow the bitterness of the hops stays with you for a few moments.

I think I actually lost my taste buds for a few hours after forcing the entire 22oz helping down my throat. I could not detect any hint of malt, but that could be because it was a bit overcarbonated and of course because of the hops.  I don't mind hoppy or strong beers. However, this was way too bitter. Maybe they should have shifted that huge hop addition a bit later into the boil so as to give a bit more flavor and less bitterness.  I'm no wimp.

Simply fabulous.  Mouthfeel: Near full body w/ light carbonation - very smooth with a warming finish from the alcohol. Somehow all flavors are present in the aftertaste (though again bitter hops are strongest) & the hop burps follow.  Drinkability: This one's not for children, but as long as you're a hop-head, the abv (7.2%) is the only thing that would keep you from drinking mass quantities. A truly excellent brew - and an absolute bleeping crime I can't get this in Oklahoma.

Mouthfeel- Nice mix of malt and hops. Nice full bodied beer, surprisingly easy to drink despite it's original gravity.  Drinkability- Great beer, not a good choice for a session beer, but I could probably enjoy three of these in one sitting without any trouble, just get a Designated driver. I really like this beer, and would put it in my top ten list",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,tgbljb,4.67,"Served as a very deep copper colored beer with moderate off-white head. Smell is loaded with piney and grassy hops with a light sweet malt character in the background. Taste is fantastic. I don't often give 5's for any beer, this one deserves it. The way it balances the strong hop essences with an equally strong malt presence is perfect. Take malt and hops balance perfectly at the finish to continue the presentation of a great beer. The drinkability is limited only by the alcohol content.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,americanwolfdrea,4.57,"This beer poured a nice pleasent mahogany brown color. It had a nice foamy head that stuck trough my drinking. I prefer it cold, when it got warm the taste sorta got over powering. The mouthfeel was rather heavy but pleasant. It tasted fantastic with some great hot wings!!! It finished a lil strong for my taste but when I am in the mood for a heavier beer I would definately go for this one!!!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,atrus138,4.63,"Poured this from a 22 oz. brown bottle.  Nice deep brownish red color with a thick, sticky head. Very intimidating.  Very complex smell. Definitely citrusy, hints of pineapple, with lots of hops.  Even more complex flavor. I liken this beer to watching Akira or reading Harry Potter - every time I experience it, I notice something new. Excellent.  Nice carbonation. Thick, but not too thick. Perfect mouthfeel.  One of the best out there. If you love beer, you owe it to yourself to try this. Heck, even if you don't, reading the bottle itself is worth the price of purchase.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,bradford,4.77,"POured from a 22 oz bomber Appearance was very nice. Dark amber, mahogany, ruby red Smell is fantastic. Hoppy, malty, an almost buttscotchy smell Taste is phenomenal. One of my favorite beers of all time and the beer that got me started on the journey to better beers Mouthfeel is good. The aggressively bitter hops sting the tongue a bit Drinkablitiy is almost as good as it gets. Very easy to put down and the alcohol is very well hidden",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,mnstorm99,4.44,"22oz. Bomber thanks to malthead. Great looking dark amber with a white head that hangs on until the end. Aroma is an absolutly wonderful mix of grapefruit (citrus) from the hops and a nice balance of malts on the nose. Grapefruit dominates from the hops at first taste but the balance of carmel and grainy malt comes through by the time it hits your throat. This is an extremely drinkable beer although one bomber would be enough at 7.2%, the hops are dominate but it is very well balanced.  Believe the hype, this is a great beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,sabinelr,4.88,"I bought this at Cost Plus on a special occasion (1 year anniversary at my job). I was intimidated by the commentary on the label, but after a bottle, I said to myself ""This is what beer should be."" A slight bitter taste reminding me of orange peel, but enough to make it beer and not something ghastly. The smell makes you think ""I'm getting into something dangerous."" The aftertaste says ""give me another bottle, and don't ruin this by eating anything."" This is the Owsley acid of beer. Don't ever be content with anything less unless you are cheap or poor.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BMoney575,4.55,"Sampled on 10-6-07  Pours a deep, blood red with a billowing tan head that lasts for ages and leaves ridiculous lacing.  Smell is huge, robust hops. You can almost smell the bitter. The maltiness adds a nice smooth aroma right in the middle.  Taste is super malty and super hoppy. It's a beer assault on the taste buds. Sweet, earthy malt, and big, fruity hops all at once followed by a huge bitter/alcohol kick. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel is good, creamy, but with a good fizziness to complement the bitter.  Drinkability is good, if you're a hardcore balls-to-the-wall beer fanatic.  Overall, only Stone could make a beer like this. Epic in every possible way.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,pwoods,4.28,"On-tap at The Comet during their Stone 11th anny pint night. Review based on notes.  A: I get an Arrogant Bastard pint glass full of this deep amber/copper mixture. About 1 finger worth of head, maybe a bit more. Good lacing all the way down.  S: Not getting a super strong aroma from this due to the bar but I've had it at home without trouble smelling it. What I am picking up is a very pleasant sweet malted aroma. Hops play in the background with a subtle piney scent.  T/M: Nice sweet malts with an almost smoky(?) twang to it. A little bit of citrus hits the tongue about midway, tieing directing into the piney hop finish. Finishes nice and dry and leaving the hops last and last. Moderate to high body adds an even greater depth to this. Very nice.  D: Not something I could sit and session.. mostly because it makes you want to slow down and savor it all. I would have another but the 11th ale is calling me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Taste- Wonderful malts tastes with hints of pine and nice bitterness. Had a slight hint of grapefruit.  Mouthfeel- Medium body with medium carbonation.  Drinkability- Awesome beer.

Taste: Ruby red grapefruit, pine, malty taste reminded me of the candy; Big red foot. Orange peel. Good bitterness that you can feel at the back of your tongue.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied. Lower than average carbonation.  Overall, I like it very much. I would drink it more often if it were lower in alcohol and if I could find some in smaller bottles.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,morayeel,4.77,I loved this ale. Its like Stone Brewing advertises most people would not appreciate an ale of this quality and complexity. I fond this ale to be very satisfying in taste with a nice grapefruit flavor and a very nice citrus aroma. This is one of the ales that the dryness at the end really stands out and is appreciated. Pours a nice dark amber color with a nice semi thick head. This is one of the most amazing ales I have had in a long time. GREAT job Stone Brewing.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,xare,3.97,"Exceptionally strong in flavor and ABV. I didn't get too much of a head with this ale but the taste is pretty strong and combines several flavors to create a brew with a character that pretty much defines ""Arrogant Bastard"".  It's a good thing that this is classified as a strong ale because this isn't for the weak-hearted! It also has decent drinkability for such a strong beer but may burn for some people on the way down.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ryalmighty1,4.6,"22 oz. bottle slowly poured into a pint glass (a few times to get it all)  Got this beer at the local liquor superstore. A little pricey, but they can get just about whatever you want.  Appearance: Very dark amber/kinda chocolatey in color, large head about a a finger and a half that persisted for quite a good time. Good lacing. Looks thick as pine tar  Smell: Hops, hops and more hops. Fruity, citrusy esters present, most definitely piney.  Taste: Now for the good part. This beer is stout, hoppy, citrusy and piney. Absolutely wonderful. Very warming as well. Bitter, yes, but so full of flavor it would be worthless if not for the bite it has.  Mouthfeel: Very, very creamy and a little fizzy at times. Easy to drink for how stout it is. Full bodied.  Drinkability: Rather easy for what it is, but if you are looking for a session beer, unless you like full bodied kick you in the shins ales, then this beer isn't for you. It will make you appreciate the subtleties of strong hops though.  Overall, I LOVE THIS BEER! First time I had it was at the Beer Sellar (actual spelling) in Newport, KY on tap, and it only keeps getting better every time I drink it. A definite A if not REALLY close to an A+  By the way, the warmer it got, the better it got. This beer really has it all...",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,SurlyDuff,4.74,"As with my Ruination review, I need to first say that I'm a bit biased towards this brew, having been drinking it for years now (though its sometimes hard to find), and finally getting around to reviewing it just now. It's been on my top 10 list, so its hard to be totally objective in a review like this...but here goes nothing:  Had on-tap at BendBrewfest (have also had in 22oz bottles).  Notable differences: Ontap taste has more caramel notes, was served much colder than when I get bottles.  Pours a reddish brown, dark. Beige/tan lacing and head. Aroma is a bit bready, lots of fruits (dried fruits mostly), hops and alcohol there too.  I really enjoy this at warmer temperatures. It explodes with flavors. Fruit, caramel, bready grain, good alchohol warmth aas it goes down. One of these 22's will last you the evening.  Recommendations: If this does you good, give the Double Bastard a try!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,IPAcraig,4.85,"I picked a few of these up in Nashville, now I am regretting not getting more. An excellent beer that I poured into my De Garre Snifter from a bomber.  Massive light brown head with good lacing, compliments an opaque dark ruby brown body.  Smells of sweet malt, figs, with a touch of hops. Very nice.  Taste of heavenly chocolate and caramel. It has a very nice dark fruit character as well. The hops are fairly big in this beer, but not overpowering or harsh. It has a nice slighlty warming alcohol presence near the end. The bitterness really lingers with this one. Like a slightly hoppy piece of dark chocolate. Perfect. Period.  This brew has a big body but has a nice medium carbonation. Creamy but not overly heavy.  This is one of the best beers out there in my opinion.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,bark,3.53,"The colour is deep amber; the liquid clear. The finger thick firm head is pale brown.  The smell is bitter with lots of fruity matured bitter hops. Some odd notes of metal and meat, too.  The taste is very bitter. There is some lightly roasted malt in the background. Some sour notes. The bitterness is not so extreme that I have expected. Some mild alcohol. It develops into a sour-bitter flavour with notes of citric fruits and citric acid. The aftertaste is long, fruity and bitter.  The carbonation is medium strong. The liquid is a little creamy.  I had, in fact, expected a lot more from this one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,NCSUdo,4.7,"Tasted in my hotel room in Austin, TX.  A: Dark amber in color. Clear with lots of bubbles. Huge frothy head on top. So chunky it looks like you could cut it with knife. Excellent lacing.  S: Excellent smell of hops. Malty undertones with maybe the slightest soapy hint. Citrusy and piney hops dominate the aroma, with oranges and some grapefruit being most noticable. Really nice aroma.  T: Hints of alcohol, with a bitter finish. Malty up front. A little unbalanced but still very good. Some surprising fruitiness and zestiness, with the slightest hint of banana.  M/D: Slick with little carbonation in the mouth. Full bodied with some surprising drinkabilty with will almost certainly lead to drunkeness.  It really sucks that I had to go out of my way in Austin to pick up a bomber of this excellent brew. I had some the night before at the Gingerman downtown and just knew I had to get some more and take down notes.

147,92,Thanby,4.33,"Pours a very dark, rich amber with a massive 4-finger dark tan head that takes a long time to dissipate into a half-finger cap. Lots of lacing, moderate active carbonation, generally pleasant to look at.  Smells primarily of hops with a strong note of grapefruit and tangerine, some cardamom, cloves, and even some toasted almond and wheat.  The initial taste is fronted by hops but followed quickly with a deliciously toasted malt. Nutty with grapefruit, cloves, and a mix of other spices. Clean finish with a small amount of hops and grapefruit lingering.  The carbonation is just right to make it smooth and not too heavy. Grapefruit is underneath everything, the hops are perfectly balanced to be present but not too strong, and there is a smokiness permeating the whole experience. Rich, medium-body with an excellent balance of supporting spices.  Very drinkable, especially with the right meal, and just absolutely delicious.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Jmamay22,4.2,"Pours a murky orange brown with a thin creamy head that retains well. Already I can smell the hops. Great lacing all the way down the walls of the glass.  A closer inspection reveals that classic Stone hop nose. Floral and piney, but balanced with a malt spine.  Tastes like it smells. Lots of citrus hops, but beneath the up front hops is are many subtleties. Caramel malts meld well with the citrus floral mélange. Clearly tipping the hops scale, but there's much more going on here. It is not a pure hop bomb, but a great complex brew.  Deceivingly drinkable with the 7.20% abv that is MIA. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. A classic and must try. One of the first beers to pique my interest in better beer and a great eye opening beer for the uninformed.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,sacrelicio,4.5,"Great, classic craft beer from one of the premier California craft breweries. Pours a dark caramel amber with a nice cream colored head with good lacing.

If this beer did not taste so good I could just look at it all day.  The nose is full of sweet malt, caramel and the hops come into play with an earthy citric like quality.  I cant begin to explain how happy my mouth is right now. My palate is overflowing with citrus, caramel, some fruits. Has a nice dry bitter finish but it does not linger as long as would be expected.

A - Pours a dark, deep redish brown, with a two finger, tightly pached, long lasting head. Lacing left all over the glass, lasting until I was finished. Appearance is very appealing.  S - Strong malty notes with a definite piny resinous hop presence.  T - Very malty, with an excellent balance of hoppy bitterness and hoppy flavor (citrus/grapefruit). Caramel notes with hints of alcoholic warmth. Aftertaste lingers as a malty thick moutcoating, but it isn't a bad thing.  M - Thick and oily. Mouthcoating and delicious.

147,92,KodyBrannon,4.78,"This beer was recomended to me by a friend and I have to say, he was dead on with his tip. This beer is a great beer. It pours a dark brown color, with a 2 finger head. The bottle it comes in was bigger than the glass, so I had to drink some before emptying the bottle into the glass. I couldn't really pick up on a distinct smell, It just smelled to me like an english dark ale. The taste was a little bitter to start, but as I got about half way through it, it was a very clean and crisp taste. I would definatly drink this beer agian and recomend this to anyone who wants somthing new to try. I would just say, be careful when drinking this, it is a little higher by volume than most beers and can give you a nice festive feeling when you drink it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

This is a good looking beer that borders between a n Amber and a Brown ale in color. The smell is hoppy and malty at the same time. The taste is like a battle between citrus hops and caramel tasting malt flavors. This is very good stuff fresh but if you get a bottle out of date you will not get the full experience on this one; the hops really fade. Too bad Stone can't produce this in six packs at a reasonable price.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Starts out with a slight hop bite, then moves onto a malt that features some caramel, some fruit, some figs,and finishes with a nice hoppy bitterness. Alcohol warms throughout.  M: Great carbonation and a nice smooth feel. Finishes crisply.  D: I love this stuff. Stone hits another home run with AB. Tasty, drinkable.

Initial taste reveals an explosion of different flavors: malt,sweet brown sugar, fruits,and piney finish. Amazing brew! Mouthfeel is smooth and inviting with a nice balance of carbonation. Drinkability is definately good also. 7.2 ABV is hidden well in this one, I'd definately drink a couple of these in a sitting, and many more in the future. Once again, Stone kicks ass with their brews and bottling!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,dfried,4.43,"Dark mahogany in color with ruby highlights, a half centimeter cream colored head. The malt jumped out at me first from the aroma, dark fruits like plums and figs, maybe a tad of black licorice, and some brown sugar and molasses. But not far behind the malt there are substantial hops, pungent floral notes with a citrusy edge.  The taste like the aroma has a lot going on with both the malt and hops. Fruity notes right up front plums, figs, dates, dark grapes, follow quickly caramelly malt, plenty of brown sugar and molasses, but also with a distinct biscuity flavor I wasn't quite expecting but was very welcome, and helped set it apart from similar beers for me. Some citrusy notes again from the hops, but primarily noticed the perfumy floral flavors from them. Rich mouthfeel, and full bodied, but not excessively sticky and heavy.  Overall: I have been burned by marketing before, but this bottle is hilarious AND the beer is awesome. A great blend and balance of flavors. One of the reasons I wish Stone was available here in Minnesota. A delight to drink.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,Rootdog316,4.18,The dark amber ale poured quite nicely leaving a frothy head. This ale has a fruity scent to it. The hops dominates the malt in nose even though it doesn't when you actually consume the worthy beverage. The ale is sweet and fruity initially and then turns almost sour. The sour soon turns to the hops with a burnt and bitter taste. I found nothing unappealing with this variation of tastes. You mouth feels slightly bitter and dry when all said and done. The more you drink the better this tastebud rollercoaster becomes. I found that the initial tennis match back and forth the sweet and bitter ended well balanced by the bottom of the glass.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

MF- silky smooth AND sticky all at once with exceptional carbonation levels. goes down wayyy too easy, which is a good thing.  D- the label was right, this beer is exceedingly complex. after 22 oz, my world has officially been rocked. could be the best ale i've ever had, but like an IPA, its intense and complex taste would not allow me to drink this all night long. i guess i just can't handle it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Strong lacing, thick sheets and tracks.  S - Smells great! Piny and citrusy hops excellently balanced with, rich sweet, creamy and spicy cereal malts. Malts are slightly ahead here.  T/M - Starts out very creamy and malty with a slight hop kick, then into some spicier malty flavors, coffee interestingly enough, and some sweeter hoppy bitterness. Finish leaves some spicy, hoppy and some darker chocolate flavors. Overall very minimal carbonation, I would have liked to have seen more. I'd probably classify this one as an Imperial Amber Ale, as it is very malty and yet still very hoppy.  D - This is great! Very easy to drink, and still very complex.

The head dissipated gradually leaving pronounced lacing.  The aroma was subdued. However, a piney hop character dominated.  The taste: GREAT beer with many complexities. Enjoy this one.... savor it it by letting it embrace your mouth and tongue. Piney hops is the first taste that hits you. But some roasted malty sweetness balances it very well. Tastes of grapefruit rind, pine, and, in the background, caramel and roasted malt.  Mouthfeel: Nice and rich. appropriate carbonation. A nice thick and chewy feeling for this beer.

There is nice lacing left behind as I pounded this one.  S: Very nice and hoppy. There is definite pine and citrus with hints of caramel and molasses.  T: This is where this beer shines. At first swallow I taste the pine, very resiny. Then the hops come on the scene. It finishes very malty bready almost with the taste of hops still lingering. Perfectly Balanced.  M: Medium bodied and ever so smooth and creamy.  D: I love this beer and could drink it by the growler full until I was fall down drunk.  Overall: As I said I give this beer credit for turning me into the beer geek / hophead that I am. Before trying this beer I was happy consuming BMC with an occasional micro brew on the side. When I left Alaska I did not see it again for several years. In the meantime I began to reach out to other brewers in the attempt to find something special.  Today every time I travel I keep an eye out for Arrogant Bastard since it is not yet available in Florida. I see her as an old flame, a lost love. Every time we reunite there are sparks which brings me back to my trip to Alaska, one of the greatest experiences of my life. Thank you Stone for making this beer which brought me out of my shell and sent me in search of other great craft brews. But most of all thank you for bring out the Arrogant Bastard in me.  Now go F**k yourself...just kidding...you have to excuse me I just pounded a bomber and thats the Arrogant Bastard coming out of me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,HappyHourHero,4.62,"On a whim I checked to see if I had reviewed this beer during one of the other 100 times I've drank a bottle. Turns out I haven't, but that may make this the first of the 1100+ reviews for Arrogant Bastard carried out in Germany. Thanks to the misses for brining this back with her. Enough of stuff you don't care about...  Poured an amazingly fine light-brown head that looked like it belonged on a Stout, and left strings of lace. Deep mahogany colored beer has a ruby glow when back lit. Aroma is bursting with pineapple along with candy sugar, alcohol, and rum. A half ton of citrus hop flavor rides a firm base of malty goodness. Finishes fairly bitter, but with lots of flavor to balance it out. The bitterness doesn't seem to disappear completely, and builds up over time. Innnnteresting. While the body is full the mouthfeel is soft and smooth making for a soothing drink. Boy do I miss this beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,kcillini77,4.2,"Picked up in CA and brought back with me to KS. Wish Stone would start distributing to the midwest. Anyway...  Smells of raisins and hops. Deep, rich flavor. Alcohol more evident than expected in an under eight percenter. Almost like an abby ale with a hoppy kick. Very enjoyable, and you have to love the pure arrogance all over the bottle. Great job, Stone!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Halcyondays,4.26,"22 oz. bomber,  A: Pours a dark ruby red, almost brown with a thick yellowish tan head which lasts for the whole glass, unbelievable lacing, thick and rich.  S: Dark toasty bready malts and piney hops.  T: Much of the same as in the smell, toasty bready malts start out the flavor, backed by incredibly strong piney hop bitterness.  M: Smooth, resiny, a bit oily, a good American Strong Ale.  D: As warned on the label, this ale is definitely not for a novice beer drinker. Strong flavors abound, good drinkability though, a great beer from Stone, definitely shows what they're about.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,MrMcGibblets,4.19,"there's just something about pouring a beer into it's own glass that makes it more appealing. this one is a dark, hazy, ruby-brown with tan head and lacing. pretty powerful and complex aroma of molasses, caramel, dark stone fruits, rum, mugicha (roasted barley tea), and resiny pine. taste is a lighter than expected malt sweetness cleaned out by a considerable roasty hop bitterness. a bit astringent on the finish. medium in body. this would stand up well to hearty and richly flavored foods (barbecued ribs, anyone?), and more than hold it's own with a cigar, which is this beer's next mission. definitely a sipper. note: have had much more of this in the interim. both maltier and hoppier than previously noted, and more complex. a heavy hitting, big beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,InDreams,4.45,"Let me begin by saying that this is the third time I've tried Arrogant Bastard. The first time, I just flat out disliked it. It was, perhaps, too aggressive for me back then. I then got a bottle and aged it 6 months or so. Tried it, appreciated the quality a bit more, but still didn't quite enjoy it. Now, I'm out in Cali again staying at an older brothers and I stumble upon a bottle I bought for him when I bought Arrogant Bastard the first time. It's from April 2005, and he drinks Heineken Light so I guess he was too boring to try it. Now, 2+ years old, this beers kicks ass. Seriously.  Poured out of a 2+ yr old bottle into a snifter.  A: Clutch; a rich mahogany with at least 2 fingers of tan-colored head that lingers throughout and leaves a satisfying lace all around the glass. Dark, sure, but not thick.  S: Blend of vanilla and woody malts are the first thing I get. Definitely lots of hops too; citrusy. When I take a sip I also pick up on the caramel character of the malts and, I think, an oak-like character, maybe going back to the woody observation.  T: This is where the aging made it great. Everything's become smooth to the point where none of the flavors really dominate the others. I get the caramel malts, very rich, with hints of that vanilla and oak. Brings to mind brandy and rye bread. As soon as the beer hits the back of your mouth it's all about the hops. Still very powerful but mellowed out enough that it doesn't smack you in the face. There's a moment of citrus, but less than expected. Floral and grassy notes take over pretty quickly, with that dry hop bitterness that begs another sip. Crisp, strong, but very complex. No traces of alcohol.  M: Certainly not a heavy beer, but pretty full-bodied regardless. Carbonation has mellowed on mine, but still pretty crisp. Quite pleasant.  D: Well I'll have to try a fresh bottle again to be sure, but I'll be damned if this old bottle of Arrogant Bastard isn't one of the top beers I've ever had. Complex and rich, with the age making it smooth and the body full and satisfying. Not a session beer, especially with the alcohol content, but certainly something I would never turn down.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,youngleo,4.03,"Appearance was very good. It poured to about a two fingered head. The head remained for quite a while. The lacing was very evident from the time it was poured until the time it was drank. It left a ring around the glass with every drink. The ale was kind of a reddish brown color, with the head being brownish white. I thought the taste was a bit stronger than most dark beers. It definately had a taste that had to be acquired. Mouthfeel was good with just the right amount of carbonation.After I finished my 22 oz bottle the high alcohol content was evident. It gave my a good head rush that was very enjoyable. If it wasnt for the high price I definately would enjoy this beer more often.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,kevinglin,4.33,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass. Deep reddish ruby-amber with a thick, off-white head that persisted for quite some time. Big hop nose with some spicy, floral characteristics. Taste is outstanding - the spiciness of the hops are ever-present and the bitterness lingers through the aftertaste, but not so long that I wish it had gone away sooner. The alcohol level is evident in the brew, but not overly hot. The mouthfeel is lively with a solid level of carbonation, with a clean, fairly dry finish. Overall an excellent brew to appreciate, higher alcohol content and aggressiveness of the beer as a whole doesn't lend it to being a session beer. I can't see drinking several in an evening, but I can see enjoying one bottle at a time for several evenings to come.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Monkeyknife,4.33,"Poured from the bottle a deep clear ruby brown with a thick rich creamy tan head. The staying power of the head is remarkable. Moderate lacing was noted.  Sweet malts, soft caramel and citrusy hops stand out to the nose.  The taste really mirrors the smell. Sweet caramel and malt along with the hoppy bitterness and bite. The alcohol is well hidden.  Medium body with a mellow carbonation.  This ale was everything I expected. Definitely not a sessionable beer but one to enjoy at every opportunity.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ccrida,3.68,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a shaker pint, Arrogant Bastard is clear ruddy brown, with a huge light khaki head that subsides to thick skim leaving moderate lace.  The nose is caramel malt and citrus hops, but not the same brightness as an IPA, they form an interesting combination that is more then the sum of the parts. Frankly, I'd prefer the hops unadulterated.  The taste is initially malty and grainy, but is quickly obliterated by the hops, finishes dry and bitter. I wonder how fresh the hops are, here they come across more grassy/leafy then much citrus or pine that I would expect. While the taste is pretty strong, it's not the richest strong ale, which is good because the finish quickly beckons another sip.  Light bodied for the style, moderate carbonation.  This is pretty drinkable for the style, but it's ultimately not the most memorable or inspiring ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Kendo,4.45,"A: Poured from a 22 oz bomber into the Stone Arrogant Bastard glass -- a tall, somewhat narrow glass that widens slightly as you go up. Sort of like a pilsner glass, but it doesn't taper all the way to a point at the bottom. Anyhow, a 2-finger khaki/tan bubbly head with staying power settles over a dark amber body with mahogany hues when held to the light. Rings and webs of foamy lacing are left behind all the way down the glass.  S: There's a lot going on in the nose: wet, grapefruity hops recall the 10th Anniversary IPA in many ways, but there's also a sugary-sweet malt scent clearly present underneath as well, hinting at brown sugar, berries and dried fruit.  T: Like the nose in a lot of ways -- candied grapefruit on top of big, sweet caramel malt hit the mouth early in the taste. Dry, bitter and even piney or leafy hops linger at the finish, with a hydration-sucking dry tang that makes the mouth water and really encourages the next sip. Great balance between the sweetness of the malt and the big hops, with a long bitter aftertaste lingering.  M: Medium to heavy in heft, and maybe just a tad bit too sharp and prickly in feel.  D: For a strong beer, this is pretty drinkable. It left a pretty solid buzz about 2/3 of the way down the bomber.  Notes: This bottle says it was best by April 30, 2007; I consumed it about 7 weeks beyond that, but I don't think that detracted from it at all. I recently drank a bottle from my cellar that had a best by date of September, 2005 that hadn't aged well; it had lost the hop bite just about completely. Younger, as this one was, it was a better balanced beer, smelled better and was more drinkable. I still liked it better on tap, but this is solid in a bottle too. Just don't let it get too old. . . .",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,shark262,4.05,"Slightly hazy ruby/amber color with a thick, creamy head. Nice lacing on the sides of my pint glass.  Floral, citrus, semi-sweet caramel and grainy notes come through in the aroma.  The taste comes in pleasing waves: a gentle sweetness hits the front of the palette first, followed by an earthy and gradually strengthening malt/hop combo. Perfumy hops fill the nose while roasted, almost vegetal flavors give way quickly to an aftertaste with a slight alcohol bite and lingering hop bitterness.  Medium-bodied ale with medium carbonation.  Complexity and drinkability in the same package.

Crisp, dry bitterness with a malty backbone. Somewhat bitter finish. Nothing extraordinary, but far from regular. Not as complex as I would have hoped for, coming from Stone. Medium bodied, and pretty well structured, but the alcohol is inserting itself, and I'm now experiencing the ""gummy snot"" in the back of the throat that is working its way up front which is unpleasant.

The taste is where this flagship of the Stone lineup shines. Great fresh floral and citrus hop flavors combined with caramel, vanilla and slight dark chocolate. Can taste the beginnings of some flavor components that really come out in the oaked version. Very nice velvety feel with medium-heavy body. Good drinkability although it can get quite filling as this is a hefty brew.

There is no detectable carbonation in this sample, though the head seems to have impressive staying power. The flavor is malt and herbal hop, with an intense grassy hop finish. The mouthfeel is full and round, yet also a bit astringent due to the big hop profile. All that flavor makes the 7.2% alcohol by volume a sneaky surprise. I'm not a big fan of grassy hops, but it you are that kind of a drinker, this one's for you. Impressive.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The beer smells like grapefruit and some roasted malts. The beer has a very aggressive bitterness that hits your tounge before you can discern any of the flavors.

147,92,BladeRunner,4.47,"Pours a beautiful ruby red, with a nice foamy head that stays for awhile. Lacing is great aswell.  Nose isn't too strong, and almost makes this beer seem tame at first. Though, I did get some nice fruity overtones.  Taste is very strong/aggressive while also offering complex flavors, then it kicks you in the ass when it finishes, but in a good way. I do taste slight roast grain and strong hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is a kick in the ass. First it seems mellow than right after it warms up the mouth a second later it slaps you in the face with an aggressive aftertaste that isn't for everybody. This is not a session beer by any means. This is a beer you will want to drink when you want something that is no holds bar tough, or an arrogant bastard.  I give them high kudos for the name they gave this beer. It fits it in everyway. Damn, arrogant bastard!!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BDTyre,4.25,"Finally, I manage to snag a bottle of this. And I am happy.  Dark ruby-mahogany with a sizable, mildly off-white head. Pleasant caramel malt smell with a slightly vinous character. Sweet-sour hints, with hops hiding in the background.  Old-ale, vinous malt taste with just enough hops to make it not too sweet. Rich, caramel flavours with coffee and vanilla hints.  Good carbonation, not to fizzy. Easy to drink, but a bit of a challenge with the ABV when coming out of a bomber.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,sessycuban,4.43,"Sampled this beer on tap. Poured into a half pint glass. Not the best of glassware, but it's all I had.  A- The beer pours a mahogany color. If you hold it up to the light, it also looks amber. The ale leaves moderate head that retains well.  S- The beer has a very malty nose. The hops are also very apparent. I think the beer strikes a nice balance between the two aromas.  T- The beer is very malty and delicious. This beer is very balanced. A lot of beers boast of being complex, but Arrogant Bastard comes across complex without being undefined. I think you can pick apart the various tastes more so than you can with other 'complex' beers.  M- This is a very smooth beer, moderate in body. I think it is much more enjoyable when served on the colder end, as the alcohol taste really comes out when served warmer.  D- I think this is one of the most drinkable beers you can find. At least for those of us in the western half of America, the beer is very easy to find, affordable, and of the finest quality.

An excellent light tan head forms on the brew, a nice layer staying throughout.  S: Hops are definitely in the aroma followed by the dark and slightly sweet malts.  T: The malts start out the experience. Dark, roasted coffee, and some slightly burnt flavors. Then the hops hit you: bitter, big, bold, and in your face. This beer is appropriately named, it's arrogant as hell. The finish is bold and bitter. This is a seriously big and complex brew. The flavors bounce all over the place. It's well balanced and surprisingly smooth for a beer as rough and raw as this one.  M: Medium bodied, smooth, with low amounts of carbonation.  D: God damn, I love this beer.

Pours a cola-colored ale with a frothy, light tan head that retains well and leaves sticky, layered lacing. An intricate aroma ensues, comprised of sage hops blended with spice, lemon, vanilla, and a touch of malt. Truly exquisite.  Taste is of bitter, ascerbic hops with some coffee, roasted nut, and an alcoholic note to boot. Mouthfeel is definately not shy about its bitterness, as it attacks the back of the palate sans remorse. Some might consider it a bit overwheming in relation to the taste, but it's still enjoyable.

Fairly clear but with a slight cloudiness; tons of big bubble dirty white head. In the nose it was rich and toasty, sweet caramel malts. Surprisingly, hops were not dominant and even hard to notice but a little spruce and pine were noted, overall the alcohol was quite noticeable, giving it a barleywine feel. In the mouth it starts off big, but unfocused. Some dark ripe fruits are there like plum and raisin, but its vague, stale, old flavors are very dissapointing. Despite it being passed its prime (date), I imaginged a high alcohol would have preserved its flavor better (maybe the store's storage was poor). There is an okay hop bitter finish, but nothing to write home about. Mouthfeel couldn't make up for its flavor being syrupy ; it had a ""big"" body but it also finished thin and watery.

147,92,3Vandoo,4.3,"a nice deep reddish beer in appearance with a tense foamy heavy head that let herself dissapeared by itself.  Smell is malty caramel, heavy hops, fruity, and shy spiceness.  Taste: quite light I was surprised actually since most Stone's product I had my hands on, were quite rich and extreme beers. Full, complex, at first the hops come in to tickle your palate followed by a sweet caramel and chocolate flavours of the malt.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ericj551,4.4,"Arrogant bastard pours a clear deep red with a nice thick head. Taste is bitter upfront, and lastingly bitter. The hops are citrusy, piney and herbal. Behind the huge hops hides a delicious malt character, sweet dark fruits mixed with tropical fruits. This is one great beer, brutal and offensive, but in a good way. I know some may consider it not respecting beer, but I like this one out of the bottle as well as in the glass, I find I taste the delicious maltiness more.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ndekke39,4.6,"I drank a bomber of this to celebrate passing my dissertation defense. I figured that now I've got the Ph.D., I can act like an arrogant bastard, and should therefore drink accordingly.  I've heard a lot about this beer, so I was excited to try it. I eventually drank the whole 22 oz by myself. Pours a delicious reddish-brown, nice and clear, with a thin, off-white head. Very good retention, some lacing on the pint glass. Smells and tastes of toasted malts, caramel, toffee, nuts. I thought this was a strong, chewy Brown Ale at first. Good balance with some mild hops. A bit of warming alcohol. Excellent mouthfeel for the decently thick flavors - I think this was spot-on; I've had far too many watered-down ""Strong"" Ales. Overall, an exceptional beer. Great body, wonderful balance of flavors, all the elements work together to make this a highly drinkable beer.

Just an IPA color with some malt. Looked like a winner right away.  Smelled like a winner. Nice malts, no sucker punches, american goodness. Hops were there, but nothing to cringe about.  First sip...Holy Fuck!!! This beer is worth writing home to my mother about. Arrogant Bastard has it all. Delicious malts, like caramel and honey. Delicious hops like grapefruit and earth.

147,92,sammy44,4.06,I got this beer on a vacation to Gatlinburg. I bought two bombers and polished them off while in the mountains.  This pours a beautiful looking beer. I poured it into my travel pint glass (clear acrylic cup) to enjoy. Pours a reddish-copper with a thick sticky head that laces the glass and sticks to everything. The aroma was all hops with very little malt sweetness. Taste was at first shockingly hoppy but the malt came through as the beer had time to warm. To me the second cup from the bomber was better than the first as I allowed the beer to warm on the counter while I drank the first serving. Very heavy in the mouth and the head added some creaminess.  A bit too high in alcohol and too harsh on the front end to be very drinkable.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Now that I am a little further into my beer drinking career, I think I am worthy, and I don't think I gave this beer a fair shot when I first had it. This is a complex brew with tons of flavor.  Poured in a New Belgium tulip-like, snifter-ish glass.  Appearance - Dark translucent copper red with a 2 finger head. The head dissipated fairly quickly.  Smell - Citrus and pine.  Taste - The hops kicks you in the face first, and the malt seduces you at the middle and the end. And then the hops kicks you again. Very balanced, big flavor.  Mouthfeel - Near perfect carbonation. Medium bodied.  Drinkability - Good. I personally wouldn't drink more than one bomber in an evening, but to each his own.  There is a lot of hype behind this beer, and to some people that is a bad thing. It is definitely a good brew. I have had other beers that don't live up to the hype. I think this one does.

Possibly a slight kick of alcohol in the smell as well.  Very strong bitter taste to it. A bit to strong to my liking. And contrary to the label I do not prefer a beer with a million dollar ad campaign. Quite the alcoholic bite to this beer. Very overpowering with the hops coming in through the center of the tasting.  A bit on the heavy side but not incredibly hard to drink. This is a good beer but a bit to strong for my personal tastes.

The palate features loads of bready malt sweetness (with a firm toasted note), but its exceedingly well-balanced by a fairly intense hop spice and bright, rich citrusy hop flavor. Some malty fruitiness (orange?) is in there in well.  Did a side-by-side comparison of this one with the oaked version: Arrogant Bastard is slightly richer, with a better balance, while the Oaked AB is a bit smoother, more refined and slightly more complex. Both were equally enjoyable and very drinkable, especially considering how rich they are.  Anyway, recommended",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Definite hops bitterness, but not overpowering [I'm not a hophead, so this was great for me]. Very nicely balanced.  Mouthfeel had a medium body, dry, smooth and cleansing.

T- I had a bomber of this and everytime I sipped I noticed something different. There was obviously a hoppy finish that remained on the palate. The hops all together were good but the aftertaste was a bit unpleasant. There are subtle hints of dark fruit and chocolate and of course a nice malt backing. What I liked the best about this brew was a nice spicy flavor that lasts thrroughout it. Carmel can be noticed when there is a great length between sips.  M- well done. medium carbonation and medium weight body. Feels good in the mouth.  D- it was different. Not an everyday thing for me. One bomber is enough for at least the next month.  This beer is above average overall-but a little bit over hyped. There are hoppier, more complex, not for the ""faint of heart"" brews out there. This just didn't live up to my expectations.

Appearance: The pour is ruby with a massive tan head that lasts until the last few sips.  Smell: The nose has citrusy and piney hops in front of caramel malts.  Taste: The flavor profile is about 60/40 hops. Citrus hops come in first and caramel malts enter the mix at the mid-palate, sticking around until the burst of bitterness at the finish. This one is big and balanced.  Mouthfeel: It's fairly smooth, but it still has that Stone stickiness.

147,92,DoubleJ,4.52,"From Escondido to Vendome to my house, on to the beer:  Poured into a huge Oktoberfest mug, its a rich amber orange color with a thick and everlasting head. Dextrin, caramel, citrus, and hops are noticed through the smell. The taste is somewhat enjoyable, though it leans towards the bitter side. They don't call it Arrogant Bastard for nothing! The bitter hops and citrus are more intense in the flavor than the smell, but I think there needs to be a little more malt (update: I object your honor! It's already pretty malty and sweet.) Perhaps I've been spoiled by its maltier brother, Double Bastard. Despite that, you can taste the sweet flavor more as the beer warms up. It's awfully sticky as some of it spills around my lips.  It's not my favorite of Stone's products, as this Bastard will come right after you. This is a beer that gets better the more samples you have of it (the original overall score was 3.85).",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,atsprings,4.97,"The beer poured a rich deep amber almost brown with a frothy head that slowly diminished but not completely and left great lacing on the glass. The aroma was of pine hops and burnt caramel. The taste is very well balanced between caramel and some brown malts along with earthy pine hops. They balance so well that both seem to dominate. The beer is medium bodied and although a little alcohol shows, it's not at all overbearing. This is one of my absolute favorite beers.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,udubdawg,4.48,"22 oz bomber  This stuff is a favorite, and I won't pretend to be objective.  This is a very small beer, tiny even. All soft, unassuming, puppies and kisses and cuddling, reminiscent of a Kansas grocery store 3.2% watered-down macro. Cute. ...OK, fine, I'll try to be serious. I remember the first time I had this - first sip was full of alcohol, then hop bitterness hits, and with some high initial carbonation it feels harsh and not at all pleasing. I probably cried when this brutal beast beat my palate to a pulp, what can I say.  Now I want to cry when I run out.  Pours a gorgeous dark amber, with excellent clarity and a three finger thick light tan/slightly yellowed head. Most of this recedes soon, but a cap lasts to the bottom, and lacing is excellent.  This beer smells good, don't get me wrong...but it is a little lighter than expected...perhaps this is intentional so the flavor is even more of a shock to the uninitiated. Toasted grains fail to hide behind some interesting citrusy hop aromas.  Again, the first thing I notice is alcohol. This beer, especially on first sip, could pass for a lot more than 7.2%. The initial spritziness that I don't enjoy dies down after only a few sips, resulting in a nice smooth medium-bodied mouthfeel. Complex and very full flavored - let's call it rich even. Ample grapefruit and bitterness that lasts well after the swallow. And we're not talking some sweetened pink grapefruit juice cocktail shit here - this is the real deal - yellow bitter grapefruit you choke down for breakfast cause you were too lazy to drag your fat ass over to the treadmill. Maybe even a little numbing to the palate - would you expect anything less?  Probably should be a sipper...but one can feel the beer making fun of your (lack of) manhood and you find yourself unable to stop drinking this awesome beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,tommy78,4.2,"Pouring out of a tall bottle, the appearance of the beer was a deep red colour. The smell was sweet; a combination of hops and malts with a touch of fruitiness. The taste is possible the best. It has an instant smoky taste, but it quickly settles into the palate with a smooth finish. Not quite fizzy but soft in the mouth. As for the drinkability, one bottle would be sufficient to enjoy. In an odd way, it complemented the sushi I had earlier in the meal.

Nice tan head, 2 fingers high, but it died down almost as quick as it rose up.  Smell - Sharp, fresh hops smell.  Taste - Very flavorful, but it was overpowered by the bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Don't sip this one, gulp it. Bitterness has less impact that way. Loved the flavors, just found myself trying to minimize the bitterness.  Drinkability - Bitter start, but you get used to it quickly.

Smells of roasted malts, grainy hops, and there is a sweet scent as well.  This beer just rolls over your mouth with flavor. I don't even think I can describe everything. There was a definate roasted/sweet malt flavor but there was also plenty of bitterness to go around. There was also citrus, fruit, and wood. I'd probably call it very bitter but it has such a strong malt presence it is hard to do so.  This feels creamy and tingly in the mouth. It goes down easy for a beer of its size, although I don't know if I could have more than the one 22oz bomber at a time.  Overall this is a great beer.

Element of wood and earth burrow in the back, with hints of grain and fruits lingering about.  T: Strong. Powerful. Flavors of pronounced fermented malts and full bodied grain clash against sweet, yet tamed hops and hushed wood notes. Grandfather like caramel fills the palate and permeates throughout. Nice.

On each lift the carbonation parts along the bottom of the glass as if part of a miracle. Superb mouthfeel, the carbonation expertly dissipating against the lips. Grapefruit is the dominance at the moment, both in aroma and in linger at the top of the throat post swallow. Strange forebodings of overpowering hops never impude, rather moving beyond strength and presence towards transcendence. Only with some lingering moments around the tongue do the hops truly reveal to us, bare in essence.

As expected, huge hops aroma with just a touch of malt foundation. The hops are heavy on the metals, relatively light on the citrus, but American all the way. On the palate, smooth pale malts hit the tongue first off, but the flavors move toward the back of the tongue very quickly, displaying lots of hop oils and citrus notes. Metals are toned down from the aroma. Very strong, oily bitterness is the key theme here -- from the mid-palate through the finish, my mouth is coated with hop oils. It's rough, tough, and definitely not subtle. Overall, this is the quintessential American strong ale -- big alcohol, very hoppy, not too balanced with malts.

T: Flavor is dominated by grapefruit hop flavor. Hop flavor is somewhat soapy. Tannin astringency. Bready malt hanging out in the background. Flavor is strong and aggressive. Slightly woody.  MF: Medium light mouthfeel. Bitterness/hops adds to perception of fullness. Alcohol warming.  Comments/D: A strong in your face aggressive beer. Leans a little heavily on the hop side for me.

Nice red/brown color with a big beige head that stands high and firm above the rim of my pint glass. Leaves good lacing.  It smells very good, sweetness of malt is the first assault, some hop/pine aroma creeps up and on the last whiff, alcohol.  It has a strong ale 'kick in the palate' taste and mouthfeel, taste the malty sweetness, bite of hops on the tongue and cheeks, finally the warming of alcohol on the finish. Very good taste for the style and abv. Creamy sort of mouthfeel, not overly carbinated, not too thin.  Good drinking ale.

Would like to see more carbonation in the mouthfeel. It is finished being somewhat flat. Alcohol is hidden making it go down smoother than it should being such a full-bodied ale. Strong phenolic notes noted on the finish. Long lingering bitterness on the aftertaste. It is not really balanced in the taste and mouthfeel areas. Overall a great brew and worth a repeated buy.

The beer pours a cloudy brownish-red color with a yellow colored, creamy head. The smell is of piney-citrus hops, very present. There is an initial sweetness, followed by a hop-bomb similar to the nose that lingers on the palate for hours after the beer is finished.

147,92,jmalex,4.13,"Time to revisit the first ""extreme"" beer I ever had. It was only three years ago that, at the end of the night, some friends saw this on the menu and ordered me one. Not one minute after receiving it, the group I was with announced we were all leaving, so I had to chug down a bomber of this. It didn't take me long to realize this beer was unlike anything I'd ever had before.  APPEARANCE: Pours an amber brown with ruby highlights and a sizable, large-bubbled beige head. It has a lot of staying power too - morphing into a rocky cap that doesn't dissipate. Tons of lace is visible all down the glass.  SMELL: Very modestly hoppy. With all of the insane hop profiles of so many beers, this one kind of subdues itself just enough, but still is able to let you know what's in store. The hops are citrusy and spicy and highlight a sneaky caramel malt base that lurks in the background.  TASTE: Usually it's obvious which flavor to begin describing, but AB is so balanced, the decision is tough. The beer starts off somewhat on the malty side, lending a sweetness that will soon be balanced out by some tasty hops. They come on quite strong and are predominantly citrusy and piny. The finish remains hoppy and lingers long.  MOUTHFEEL: Perhaps the one area where I feel this beer is lacking. It seems somewhat thick at first, but I can't help but find it a bit watery. I think with a beer this robust, it should have a bit more body to it.  DRINKABILITY: Excellent. The 7.2% is well disguised. It's strange how our definition of ""extreme"" has changed when one can imagine themselves drinking AB all night, but it really is the case.  After that first taste of Arrogant Bastard three years ago, I had to look it up online. A quick Google search led me to my first ever visit to beeradvocate.com.

Nose is incredibly strong, lots of hops and even the malty, fruity sweetness comes through. Definitely not your average IPA (although it doesn't look as though they even classify it as such). Taste is incredible. Amazing balance of hoppy bitterness and complex malt flavors, caramel and raisins, and about a thousand other things. Really an amazing taste. Feel is fairly heavy (I needed something lighter after to ease up on the pallet a little) and full-bodied. Good carbonation. Overall, a really delicious beer. The first time I had this one it was too much for me, I couldn't handle it (just like the bottle says). But after having a couple more this one really comes through as original and quite delicious.

T: Big roasted malts explode on to the scene and are immediately taken over by earthy almost medicinal hops that leave a nice bite on the tongue. A soft citrus presence is followed by more sweet malts that add complexity to the brew. Tea like flavor is finished off with the taste of toasted bread.  M: Smooth and rich. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Slightly dry.  D: This is the my benchmark for an American Strong Ale. Complex and well balanced. Dangerously drinkable for the alcohol content.

147,92,RedneckChemist,4.65,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into my favorite pint glass  Appearance: Beautiful orange-brown beer with light beige head. About two fingers with good retention and impressive lacing.  Smell: Nice balance here. Sweet malts are there, but there is no doubt that hops live here.  Taste: Wow! There is a lot of depth to this flavor. Outstanding! The hops, piney and earthy, are absolutely the centerpiece of this beer, but the malt comes through to give wonderful balance to this brew. Slight alcohol warming lets you know its working.  Mouthfeel: With so many flavors going on in this beer, it is a mouthful. Medium-bodied feel gives room for the explosion of flavors that lie beneath.  Drinkability: On flavor alone, I could drink this all night long. However, with the amped-up abv, I believe it best to limit these to one or two in a sitting.  Highly recommended beer! There is so much going on in this beer that it is better experienced than explained. I keep a spare in the fridge to share with any misguided friends that wonder in with inferior beer in their arms. At least for once they get to experience what a real beer is all about.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,travisd13,4.38,"This is review #1 for me!!  Whats left to be said? This is old faithful. When in doubt the Bastard will always treat you well.  Served from a slightly-chilled 22oz bomber into a snifter.  Pours a very dark red color, with a thick tan head about two fingers deep.  The smell is complex, citrus, caramel malts, and a light hint of hops.  The flavor is as good as the smell. Not an IPA. A bit of a tease to the taste buds between hops and malt. Get ready for a ride!  The mouth feel is clean and carbonation levels are first-rate. For the strength of this beer it is very drinkable!  Enjoy it if you get the chance!

147,92,sethmeister,4.23,22oz into pint glass at 50 degrees  Hard pour yields three fingers of frothy mocha colored head atop a dark red body. The head gradually falls and leaves panels of lace decorating the glass. A swirl of the glass kicks up a bit more head after it has fallen.  Strong scent of caramel and fruity citrus hops evident as soon as I cracked the bottle.  This beer is a war between malty sweet caramel and bitter grapefruit rind hops. The spicy bitter hop flavor lingers into the finish encouraging another sip. Thick bold taste which ends crisply.  Nice rich medium-thick mouthfeel with prickly carbonation.  The drinkability is very high. The alcohol is borne well and I'm wishing I had another bottle.  I've had this beer many times before but this is the first time I've reviewed it. This Bastard never fails to please.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Good retention and lacing.  Smell: Citrus, caramel, roast malts. Complex.  Taste: Delicious and interesting. Well-balanced, not overly hoppy or overly malty. Flavor profile is similar to the smell: citrus, caramel, roast.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy, good body.  Drinkability: High!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The chunky gigantic head settles to a big old pillow and leaves cobs of tanned lace all over the glass. Carbonation appears medium but quite persistantd  Nose: Caramel malts with a grassy hop back. Not very potent. Alcohol jumps out after a while.  Taste is mostly a quick sweet caramel malt, followed by intense dry bitterness. The hops are present in bitterness, but lacking in desirable flavor. A little medicinal tinge on the finish.  A nice full mouthfeel.  I found this to be an enjoyable ale, but failing to live up to its hype. Lacking the hop flavors i've read about in others reviews. Maybe an older bottle. Goes straight to the head.  EOV",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,auntfloyd,4.5,"This is review #100 for me, and fittingly enough, its the ale that started it all for me, Arrogant Bastard.  Served from a slightly-chilled 22oz bomber into an Arrogant Bastard pint glass.  Pours a very dark red color, almost black at times, with a large tan head that sticks around. Very nice looking ale.  The nose is complex; although citrusy West Coast hops are the most noticeable aspect, there is a definite component of sweetish caramel malts, especially towards the end. Fairly balanced, although tending towards the hops side of things.  The flavor delivers on what the smell promises. This is a big ale, filled with big flavors: citrus hops on hand, and sweet, caramel malts on the other. They blend and play off each other very well, although, as is the case with most Stone ales, the hops come out the winner, with a distinct bitterness at the end. Still, this is not an IPA, and the malt notes are well represented.  The mouthfeel is good; the consistency and carbonation levels are excellent. Drinkability is high, especially for an ale of this strength.  For me, and many others, Arrogant Bastard pretty much defines the concept of the Big Beer This is an experience anyone who likes beer should have. Definitely one of my favorite ales, and one of the top overall, as far as I'm concerned. There's a lot of hype around this ale, but there's a reason for it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Bitterbill,4.28,"Pours from 22oz bottle(room temp) a clear deep amber with a huge head of foam that just won't quit. Solid layer with lots of lacing.  The smell is very hoppy. I note grapefruit in big abundance.  The taste on first sip is hugely hoppy. Lots of citrus that makes your mouth want to pucker but just before it does, the malt moves in and somewhat tames the hops. No, more than that. The malt actually takes over the flavour and I'm not talking really sweet caramel malt...wait...yes I am. Wow. You fooled me. ;^) Boy, is this a treat.  Further sips in and I'm getting more of the balanced flavours but mind you, while the hops and malt seem to be working in unison, I cannot deny that the said flavours are as big and bold as the great outdoors. Like the label says, this is an aggressive beer and it refuses to let you just sit there and reach a comfort zone; when you're sipping on it, it takes center stage and all others things going on around you become mere side shows. What an egotistical brew and...I'm loving it!  Bottom line: A fantastic brew that will earn your attention whether you wish to or not. Highly recommended!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,gpcollen1,4.4,"Pours a murky and evil dark brown into my Smutty Big Beer glass. Ruby highlight made out when the light hits just right. Other than that, relatively inpenetrable. Head rises a sturdy 1/2 inch and then relaxes a bit. Hops and roasted malt on the nose. Smells akin to a hopped up brown ale with some sweet assed roasted and chocolatey malts.  Hops hits the tongue a running. It takes a bit for the roasty sweeteness to come through. You pick it up quicker as the glass empties a bit. Hints of alcohol come through as the carbonation fizzles on the tongue, drying it out with an ice scraper and then slathering some fat bittering hops on the acrape wounds.  Glad I finally got around to reviewing this. It is truly wonderful.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,AppalachianTrout,3.81,"This beer pours a nice brown color with a tan head - not much carbonation on the pour. The smell is a pleasant fruity smell. This beer is very well balanced and is just a great beer that I could drink over and over again. Great mouthfeel, excellent taste with a fruity aftertaste.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jockstrappy,3.96,"Pours a rich mahogany-brown color with a creamy tan head that leaves a soap like lace behind. Aroma is very light here, just a fruity hop note is all. Taste is a buttery malt presence up front, that smoothly transitions into a blend of citrus hop flavors, orange peel bitterness, and alcohol warmth. Finish is fairly clean with a lingering orange peel effect.Thicker body, with smooth carbonation provide a heavy, yet pleasant mouthfeel. Drinkability suffers only from it's ABV.  Good beer, but I would like to try it closer to it's source.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,kernalklink,4.17,"Poured a reddish brown with nice head retention- great fresh hop aromas cascade off the pint glass- cirtusy piney- nice. Flavors are all over the place; a somewhat spicy, fruity, alcoholic malt, with an oatmeal thickness and slight sweet character atttempts to fend off the assertive hops- no way. The finish is a sticky hop bomb with some malt along for the ride. Very nice, wish there was some on tap right now....",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,raid765,4.67,"Pours a near perfect ruby brown color with minimal carbonation.The smell is deep and rich, but not at all overpowering. The taste is a surprising combination of depth of flavor, smoothness, and pure potency. The hops and the malt stand alone on their own merits, but are delivered in a perfect balance. The mouthfeel is unusually light for beer of this nature, but not at all disappointing. As one of the best beers I have ever tasted, the drinkability is good to say the least.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,yelterdow,4.5,"22oz. bomber served at a few degrees over fridge temperature in a pint glass. Best before 05 09 07.  Appearance- Pours a crystal clear fiery orange with chestnut and deep amber tones... really quite a beautiful color. On a good pour, the head rises quickly to a full three fingers... and it stays there for minutes. Eventually the big, soapy head begins its digression... leaving craters while retaining much of its mass. The lacing is fantastic, leaving gobs of sticky sheets behind. Big.  Smell- A simply incredible balance of huge, juicy hops together with a rugged, yet bready malt backbone. The more I dive my nose into the glass, the smoother and more balanced the aroma. I do sense an alcohol presence, although in no way does it interfere. I can't wait to taste this.  Taste- A full bodied tribute to the bigness of hops and malts, with a bonus kick to the head in ABV. Wonderfully intense, it challenges the timid beer drinker for sure... these are really big flavors. Wildly wicked bitterness in the back of the mouth, carrying the malt profile somehow right along with it. There is a unique interplay of sweet vs. bitter that is executed better here than in any other beer of this type. Definitely well deserving of the big ratings.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A ""wimpy"" texture is all we get here after all this haughtiness? Surprisingly, most of the carbonation of this beer is released and spent in the enormous, magnificent head. Thin on its way in the mouth, it never develops an interesting enough body to showcase the massive character... but since the flavor holds its own, it's not a dealbreaker. With a smile, I gulp and belch the rest of this ale down, realizing that one of these is enough... but damn I'm enjoying this tasting.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,AustinBeerLvr,3.57,"Had this on tap at the Draught House in Austin.  A: Beautiful dark, mahagony, red color with a good amount of head and lacing on the glass as it's consumed.  S: Without a doubt, one of the biggest complextity of hops and malt flavors I have every experienced in a beer before I even tasted it. I don't even know where to start other than I got a wonderful array of fruity hops and sweetness throughout the sniff.  T: A huge amount of flavor hits the tongue right up front including, the incredibly fruity hops and malt all seem to blend together into one. Most of the taste seems to have kind of a cherry like sweet flavor that stands out more than the other fruity flavors. Alcholol comes through and warms the throat some as it's fairly potent, but not excessive. One good thing that Stone Brewing Company did was not overdoing the bittering hops on this brew, as they are defenitely there, but don't overwhelm. At the end of the sip, there is a huge sweetness that comes through that leaves a long sweet aftertaste.  M: The body of this brew is very good, not watery, plenty of mouthfeel, just a tad on the sticky sweet side.  D: This brew would get an good rating for drinkability from me if it weren't for the excessive sweetness at the end. In my opinion, the sweet finish just sticks around too long, and I found myself wanting a glass of water by the time I finished the pint. I know it seems kind of strange to have such a large gap between dinkability and flavor, but this brew is defenitely not meant to be a session beer. That said, the complexity of this beer is defenitely something that should not be ignored. Also, watch out for the kick of this brew, as the ABV is nothing to sneeze at.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,prototypic,4.28,"Appearance: Dark brown to a deep red color. Nice one and half finger head, which departed rather quickly. A lot of lacing. Very nice looking.  Smell: Big time malts, sweet caramel and toffee, big time pine. You can literally smell the arrogance rolling off of this one.  Taste: This initially tastes sweet. Definitely can taste some caramel and a hint of vanilla. Very nice malty taste to it as well. There's also a bitter hop hit at the end. Love it.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is a great beer. It's got a nice, sweet taste to it and evolves into a rush of bitterness. This really is one of my favorite beers. Definitely a regular in my fridge. But, one bomber is enough for me. No more than that. Overall, I highly recommend it. Truly a classic. Sure to bring out the arrogance in all of us.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

If nice clear deep amber color and rich head had me excited. The smell was very heavy on hops, which a rep from Stone told me were Centennial hops. He then told me about how the dry hopping process worked before I took my first sip. The malt I expected from the Bastard wasn't as apparent as I thought it would be, however, despite the hoppiness it was a very smooth drink.

147,92,steamingheap,4.65,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance - Deep red in the glass with a quickly collapsing head.  Aroma - Piney hops and roasted malt with the hops dominating. Strong aroma - no need to bury your nose in the glass to get a whiff of this one.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Full mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. The flavor keeps your mouth busy. Starts with malt and some sweet caramel with roasted flavors. Then for a half second, you notice that this one has some alcohol right before the hop flavor takes over thorough a dry finish and into the aftertaste. Every time I take a drink, I notice some new detail, but the general description above holds true.  Drinkability - I am not worthy, but fortunately they still let me buy a bottle and taste this fantastic brew. I wouldn't want this at a summer picnic after a day in the sun, but fortunately for me it is February. This is highly drinkable and enjoyable as there is nothing about the complex profile that isn't incredibly enjoyable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,blakesell,4.18,"Small creamy head, almost like a cream ale or dry stout.  As expected from Arrogant, very hoppy aromas, Centennial dry hopping apparent.

147,92,Bierguy5,4.17,"Pours a mahogany color, but probably a bit lighter that the original. Thick creamy, nearly white head, with excellent retention and lacing. Seems very standard for a solid cask beer. Big hoppy aroma. Centennial hops seem to be the showcase, as floral and citrus notes are present. Toffee, caramel, and a bit of fig are somewhat hidden behind a great amount of floral, citrusy, and piney hops. The creamy feel and low, soft carbonation make this treat oh so drinkable.

Well it smells like cask beer. A metallic aspect that isn't too apetizing. Hints of toffee, with a dose of hops but not much more.  Very nice. Toffeed malt leads way to hints of fig, raisin, pine hop with very rustic earthy tones. Hops are slightly resiny and sustained. Alcohol is well hidden yet is still there.

Extremely dense, slides down the side of the pint with every drink. Nice tight lace.  Smell: Big piney hops. Toasty malts.  Taste: Huge piney hops, very dominating in the taste especially the resiny aftertaste. Sweet caramel malt flavors can be distinguished as well as an understated alcohol note.  Mouthfeel: Medium in body, which surprised me due to the thickness in the pour. Soft carbonation, lightly warming. Finishes dry and biting.

147,92,PhiloPsych,4.48,"The beer looks brown as it pours from the bottle, but is more reddish/orange in the glass. It is slightly cloudy with a moderate head. The smell is hoppy and spicy. The taste is also strong on hops (with a touch of pine) backed by toasty malt. The mouthfeel is smooth and full. The biggest problem with this beer is that if you become accustomed to it, other beers won't ever taste the same--they'll always seem more watery, weak on flavor, and low on hops by contrast. For me it has become the standard according to which I judge all beers. As the beer warms, more flavor, more complexity comes through in both the smell and the flavor. It goes great with pizza.  For all its heavy dutiness it is actually quite drinkable (though I wouldn't want to drink it all the time). At 7.2% it is strong enough to provide a nice buzz with just one 22 oz. bottle, so you don't need to drink as much of this as of other beers.

Smell: Lots of piney hops combine with roasted malt. Very enticing.  Taste: Theres a lot going on here. The roasted malts do a surprisingly good job of balancing out the massive hops, which you might otherwise expect to knock things out of whack.  Mouthfeel: Excellent. The hops finish things off with a nice bitterness and leave you wanting another sip.  Drinkability: As the label (hilariously) advises, this is not a beer for everyone. If youre in the mood for a serious American ale, though (as I was tonight), you could drink these all night.

This head is going nowhere! Taste is very good....bitter hops up front give way to some glorious malts with a nice roastedness and a re-appearance from the banana. Mouthfeel is excellent and the finish is earthy and it makes my mouth water like quench chewing gum. The alcohol is pleasantly subdued for the abv%. This is seriously growing on me...even though the alcohol isn't overpowering it still gives you a little chest warmth. The aftertaste is caramel-like with a load of grassy bitter hops.

Mouthfeel- Smooth. Goes down great with lingering hops in the finish.  Drinkability- Definitely a good session, if you ca afford it. High ABV might get you as well...

Nice light brown/dark amber coloring with a slightly tinged head. Lacing all the way down the glass.  Smell is fantastic, fruity and floral hops... tons of grapefruit.  Taste is spectacular, a hoppy treat, but not offensive by any means. Oils coat your throat but they're welcomed, and beg you to keep drinking. Lots of fruit, bitterness, no alcohol bite at all. The malts are very understated, but present.  Arrogant Bastard is medium bodied and medium carbonation. Not too much, and not too little.  This was a pleasant surprise, and I'm excited to try more from Stone.  *as a side note, i've been drinking this beer a lot recently, and still love it just as much or more than when i originally wrote the review. i managed to try some on tap last night and was absolutely floored... the head was remarkable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Light toffee/butter. Mild chocolate/coffee notes. Smells like some otherworldly fruit.  Strong hop juice, significantly bitter with piney citric bouquet. Beneath there is a bed of malt, lightly sweet but strong enough to balance the heightened hop level. Light spicy undertones. Notable dry bitter aftertaste. Quite tasty.  Smooth and thick. Mild carbonation and foamation. Could have a little more carbonation spunk.  This is a brew that isnt afraid of hops, and knows how to use them. Its not over-the-top; its strong and balanced nicely.

Taste- First thing that jumps out at me is the Alcohol. The hops tingle the back of my throat nicely with a fruity kick. A nice caramel toasty sweetness that is very pleasant. Overall a very tasty brew!  Mouthfeel- A very fine carbonation that matches the beer very well.  Drinkability- Very tasty beer that deserves the recognition it's received.

The carbonation is a bit strong for my taste but works well with the tangy grapefruit notes.  Overall it is a fine example of the style. I could not have more than one in a sitting that is for sure. It is complex in many ways and is a must have for American Strong Ale lovers. I am more of an Imperial Stout man myself, but can definitely appreciate what this brew has to offer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,karengarys,3.85,"This looks great in the glass, pouring a clear mohagony and leaving a little head from my slow pour.  Smells nice and malty and sweet.  Taste is quite hoppy - lots of pine flavor, along with a bit of dryness. There is a malt behind it to balance it out a bit.  Mouthfeel is very nice and foamy - not too creamy, not too coarse, and nice and cold (somehow).  Finish is a bit edgey - this is where the taste falls off a bit to me. It is creamy at the end, but there is a bit of a bitter aftertaste - too piney for my likings.  This is a great brew worth giving a try. To avoid the aftertaste.... ...keep drinking!!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,TheSarge,3.96,"Arrogant Bastard Ale gives off aromas of lemon/grapefruit characters, with a little bit hint of spruce. I find there is also a slight smokiness that is unique to pale ales.  It tastes brilliantly balanced with thick maple syrup like malt, and strong as hell hops aroma. This beer is brilliant.  Its very richly carbonated and produces mammoth head, which lasts upwards of 10 minutes after being initially poured. The body is a richly deeply dark reddish amber in color and is somewhat translucent.  This feels very syrupy and smooth, with a moderate amount of CO2. There is a slight oilyness from the hops and a warm follow through after each sip.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Tasty, a bit reserved in the hops flavor and aroma compared to a fresh version. I liked it better with some age on it. I could imagine it cellaring a year or two longer and seeing how it comes out. While not in my market, I can see why people like this brew.

Wonderful ruby brown color with a sturdy tan head that left an appealing lace in my glass. Smell was very complex  there is a lot going on here. Hops are all over the place as well as the roasted grains the fruit esters. Very enjoyable. Complex flavor that I found to be more enjoyable as the beer warmed a bit. This beer is hard to find in my area, but it was worth all the effort. I enjoyed this beer very much and would gladly purchase more.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Conrad,3.88,"Not available in Canada, but I was lucky enough to get a bottle as a Christmas present. The label and script on the bottle is a hoot. Even if you are not a bitters fan, you should get one just to read the thing. As a hop head, I can say this ale is one of the best ESBs I have ever tried. Appearance is a nice dark ruby amber with a thick attractive head that lasted several minutes and left sparkly lacing. Smell: The hops bitters hit the nose with a punch. Then you pick up on strong malt with a bit of spice. Taste: Aggressive hops bitterness jumps on the tongue and wants to stay there. The malts are big enough to keep the hops in line, making this a well build beer. Yum. One of my favourites. Mouthfeel: Heavy, with perky carbonation as a big ale should have. Long bitters finish. Very refreshing. Drinkability: I want more! This goes down smooth and easy. Top marks. Now if only they would export this from USA to CAN.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BrewMonkey,4.1,"Probably my favorite beer ever.  Pours very dark with tons of sticky head. Even with a slow light pour you end up with a good 1 inch of head.  Aroma is hoppy but with a strong malty background. Taste follows suit. As the bottle indicates, the hop flavor is very aggressive, but the body and maltiness is perfectly balanced with the hops. Body is heavy, almost syrupy, but finishes with the hoppy bitterness that sticks to your pallete.  Only the slight heaviness keeps this beer from being more drinkable. Otherwise, it's the most flavorful beer I've enjoyed to date.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,scorched,3.41,"Served in a 1 pt 6 fluid oz bottle into a glass...  The color is quite nice. A deep amber color, which almost looks like barley wine. Unfortunately, this is not barley wine. The head doesn't stick around that long, no matter how hard you pour it.  The smell is interesting, to say the least. A very yeasty smell, with some sweet malt smell, and a definite hop presence. Not sure what the IBU is here, but its definitely high. Not quite balanced with the malt profile.  The taste like I said before, is unbalanced, and very hoppy. Hoppy beers are my forte, but I'm not sure I can get into this one so well.  The mouthfeel is heavily carbonated, as one would expect with an ale, not smooth at all.  Not really that drinkable, due to the overly carbonated profile and unbalanced profile... Just like the bottle says, I probably won't like it... well, I'll give it a ""why the hell not.""",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

T - Bitter immediately. Mostly bitter pine hops with a bit of grapefruit pith bitterness too. It almost tastes sour, but I think it is just a side effect of the bitterness.  M - Thin, a little harsh, pretty refreshing.  D - Alright. If you love bittering hops, then this is for you. I think it could use a bit more depth in flavor to be a truly great beer, but a great delivery of what I believe the brewer is intending this to be.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,halfassedjedi,3.98,"This is my first beer review, and as im not very skilled in the art of beer tasting, im kinda winging it here. Bought this beer after the chargers lost to the patriots in this years playoffs. Big bummer for me, but whatever. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beer poured a very nice amber mahogany shade. Nice thick one finger head that stayed more or less towards the end of the drink. Lacing was decent. Mouthfeel, to me, was pretty good but a bit bitter. I like bitter, but it lingered a bit longer than I would have liked. Other than that, taste was awesome. Nice and malty, with enough hops to balance it out. I would recommend this to any fan of nice dark ales.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,RobertDwight,4.38,"Waited quite a while to try this beer. Have to come right out and say that its a damn tasty brew and I wish I could have more already! This beer has a deep amber color with decent head that fades quite a bit, but has a slight amount of retention. Smell is dominated by hops, but doesn't over power it. I think they are amarillos, but not sure. Taste is wonderful, a close perfect balance between malt and hops...one doesn't over power the other. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very high. I could confidently say that I would drink one of these everyday if given the chance! Stone PLEASE distribute to Iowa!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The smell is slightly roasty, slightly sweet and a little musky. The taste is very hoppy/musky and powerful. It tastes a bit old. The mouthfeel is a little lacking, it's a bit harsh. Overall I will try this one again, but it's not my session beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,lordofthewiens,4.23,"A very pretty dark red-brown color with a thick off-white head. It had a sweet, citrusy aroma, as well as some malt. The taste was similar to the aroma. Citrus, and a good lingering bitterness. Maybe the bitterness stayed a little too long, but that's a minor quibble. This was a good beer to drink, very enjoyable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ZimZamZoom,4.45,Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass. No idea about freshness date.  This beer pours a beautiful dark amber with about two fingers of light tan head. Deep malty aroma with bold notes of citrusy hops. Much more fruity aroma than I remember the few times I had it before.  Taste is the same as aroma. Malty and high in citrus. Nice lingering bitter aftertaste.  Nice smooth mouthfeel with not too much carbonation. I like this beer a lot.  This is a nice drinkable strong ale. No too strong to down a couple but don't let them creep up on you!,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,StargherKing,3.52,"Poured thick, almost syrupy. No head to speak of. Color is a murky reddish-brown, slightly clearer at the edges of the glass. Smell is somewhat dull, definite scent of hops, a hint of spiciness. Taste is a shockingly strong orange at first, with aspects of pear and pomegranate, giving way to a spicy hop taste and mellowing out to almost a smooth creaminess. Not a real cream taste, more like a cream soda. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, very heavy. Drinkability is ok, the only real problem is the oily mouthfeel, though I could see this being a positive to some people. Overall, while I'm not sure I'd run out and buy more, if offered I would jump at the chance to drink this beer again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,KyleVick4,4.11,"22 oz bomber  A: Pours a deep red, very dark rust color. White head leaves beautiful lace along the sides. Looks a bit intimdating, or maybe I just read into the marketing to much...  S: Hop smell is dominant, with stong caramel notes. The alcohol is a bit heavy there also. Not as intimidating on the nose.  T: This is where its at. Hits with a good hoppy strike followed by a hearty malt finish. The caramel is strong and rich and you get bits of chocolate in there as well. The alcohol is not as strong a factor as the smell might have suggested, althought the malt may be just a bit to overpowring, I think a bit more hops would work wonders.  M: Thick and chewy, the carbonation is a healthy balance for a beer of this gravity. Shockingly smooth for the amount of malt, goes down very easy.  D: A deceptivly good beer. Very hearty and full of character, plus the advertizing campaign is pretty nice, ""Hated by many, loved by few"" hell I may put that on my tombstone...

Smells of some sweet fruit, caramel, biscuit, and piney hops. Lots more flavor in there, too...I expect more as it warms up.  Flavor is huge. Lots of caramel and biscuit sweetness, and a hops sledgehammer to balance them out. Awesome diacetyl/buttery notes as the hops vie with the malts for palatal domination.  Mouthfeel is awesome as well, largely because of the aforesaid buttery smoothness. The hops are hanging in my throat, though not in my mouth so much. Smooth. Does not finish very cleanly, but it's the hoppy ""coated"" feeling like what Ruination gives you, it's not a cloying (eww) or anything like that.  Drinkability is good, abv is not even too terribly high. Only downside would be that if you werent planning on Arrogant Bastard all night, you'd have to have one hell of a beer to follow this one with.

The body is a dark red brown southern style iced tea color. Mild American hop fruitiness up front, slightly floral with citrus and beets, caramel malt back ground and a tiny smokey or nutty note. The taste is an excellently balanced, sweet malt with just enough rounded bitterness. I taste caramel malts with mellow smooth bitterness beets, citrus and sweetness. My only critiques I might wish it was a tiny bit more carbinated. This is definitely one of my favorite American strong ales. I'd totally buy this again especially during the summer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,bigone4,4.2,Poured from a 22oz bottle. Dark amber color almost a dark ruby when back lit. Fluffy off-white cream colored head creating a mild lace down the glass. The head dissipated after a while. Smells of a nice malt sweetness. Mild tones of caramel and a light hop scent. Hints of a citrus scent hidden in the back ground. Nice nose with a very pleasant and distinct aroma. The taste was of a nice well rounded malt flavor up front. Roasted nutty malt flavors followed by a light sweetness on the tongue. Mild hop bitterness rounds out the well balanced flavor in the back of the mouth. This is a great full bodied brew. Great rolling flavor from start to finish. Very smooth and drinkable.

Thick frothy head about a fingers width that receded to a mildly sticky lace. Color is a solid dark brown, just the slightest light penetrates around the edges of the glass. Smell is mostly hoppy with a malt balance to it. Taste is exceptionally balanced between the hops and the malt. The hops hits you up front and then mellows out to a rich roasted malt. Mouthfeel is wonderfully full and creamy. I wish Stone beers were available in Missouri. I would have this one hand all the time.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,oakbluff,4.3,Appearance- deep red colour with a creamy white head. Smell is more sweet than hoppy which surprised me. Taste is a very balanced to me- the malts and hops are in synchronicity. I was expecting more of a hop blast- it may be that I have held on to this bottle too long and the hops has subsidided. No matter- still a classic west coast beverage. Or it the lack of hops could be due to my mouth being hammered into a submission by a Surly Furious a couple of hours earlier. Mouthfeel is rich with a medium to low carbonation. The head dissapated quite quickly in my pint glass. Overall- it would be a staple for me if I could just access it on a regular basis.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,MiScusi,4.4,"22oz bottle acquired December '06.  I love this beer as a strong ale. A rich translucent brown in color, with a tan head, the smell that initially hits your nose is fresh floral hops and citrus aromatics. The taste is a caramel maltiness up front with a long lasting intense bitterness at the end. Fresh wet hops are present throughout. As it warms, caramel is much more apparent in the aroma, and the lingering bitterness is much less than I remember the very first time I had it.

147,92,cjhofelt,2.3,"Bought a bomber of this tonight because I've heard so many raves about it. I have to say, I was afraid this would happen. It's like this whenever the hype about something takes on a life of it's own. I'm surprised by how many of the top reviewers rate this so highly. I consider this ""The Emperors New Beer"".  I will say, though, the appearance of this beer is exceptional. It's a rich deep copper color with a dense inch or so of beige head. All beers should be this beautiful in a glass. It made me very hopeful that the beer would live up to it's reputation. The head stayed a long time and left an impressive lacing on the glass. It's a very well made beer, as far as looks go.  But those hopes evaporated when I smelled it. Don't get me wrong, I love the smell of hops. But that's all this beer has. Other beers, good beers, have something besides that. This is a very one dimensional beer.  Taste? Well, there again, I love hops, but I don't care to eat them as a meal by themselves. In fact, there isn't much flavor there, just an intense bitterness that overpowers any hop flavors that I know must be there. There is no subtlety to this beer. It's a real sledge-hammer approach to brewing. It reminds me of guys who enter chili cook-offs with the hottest chili that they can make, but forget that it has to taste good, too. It's like Yngwie Malmsteen's guitar playing. Yeah, he's the fastest, but it's not a race. Play something good, we know you have the skills.  Great mouthfeel, though. It has a very creamy body. Very dry without tasting overly alcoholic (which it kinda' is at 7.2%).  Not very drinkable, though. It was a bit of a chore finishing the bomber. I did, though, it was better than the Miller High Life Lite I tried the other day and couldn't finish.  Sorry, but I can't give this beer a better rating than this, I suppose I'm just not ""worthy"". Flame away, but, really it's a lame beer with a great marketing strategy. At least it's a well made lame beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Dark copper to crimson with a smallish head of light tan that shows some retention before falling into a fat veiled ring.  Lots of grapefruit in the nose. Some malty sweetness pokes out underneath but the has hop bomb written all over it.  The taste delivers what the nose promised. Lots of grapefruit bitterness, yet it is framed by just enough malt to keep it somewhat in check. Well rounded overall.  Moderate mouth that has weight with enough carbonation to keep it lively. Very drinkable for such a hop bomb.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Gatch,4.38,"22 oz. Bottle  Pretty intense but in a very drinkable way. The aroma brings your guard down, which is mostly a citrus or tropical fruit, like mango, but once you take a sip, it throws you back. I'd say the malt is most present in the aroma, but the hops are more prevalent in the taste.  A head of about 1 inch with a deep mahogany red color. Very smooth but strong palate presence. A subtle chocolate finish that leaves you wanting another mouthful and wanting to investigate more flavors. No alcohol presence, which is good. Definitely a great beer to enjoy at any time, especially at the price. Please drink this.  1/19 - Just had it on tap yesterday at The Yard House in Scottsdale. Wow, this beer is incredible. One of the strongest yet most drinkable beers I've ever had. I needed to edit this because the taste is crazy grapefruits.

There was very good lacing that covered the entire interior of the glass throughout drinking. Smell is mostly bitter hops, with some citrusy notes coming through slightly. Taste is bitter but refreshing at the same time. Mouthfeel is somewhat astringent but enjoyable at the same time. Becomes a little cloying after a while. It's a very good offering on draft, however I think I could only drink a two pints of this at most. Would tire of the taste after that.

Thick creamy off-white towards tan colored head. Good retention with curtians of chunky lace going down the sides of the glass.  Good, fresh, pronounced hop aromas of citrus/pine even grapefruitty. The aroma was also a bit fruitty.  Intense hop flavors of citrus/pine really gets grapefruitty as the beer warms. Has an amazing crisp and clean taste even with all the hoppiness. Carmelly and chocolaty, the malt flavors start to balance as the beer warms. Finishes with a sharp,tart bite, a sweet,syrupy malt taste is left lingering on the palate. I needed all 22oz.of this beer to capture all the flavor.  A thick to medium mouthfeel,cloying and very tangy. One of those beers that just gets better with every taste. As for drinkability,I had no problem drinking a 22oz. bottle of this tastey beer. The more I drank the better it went down. Seems like one of those beers that keeps growing on you.

147,92,SteveO1231,4.3,"I decided to re-review this beer because either the beer is different or my palate has changed. Either way I will give this beer another review. Same ol' AB raised lettering, no freshness date found. Pours a dark brownish red, almost like blood with some ruby red highlights. Nice light tan head, thick and chewy. Nice spider webbed lacing in the glass. Low carbonation. Aroma of generous amounts of caramel malts along with a large American hop profile hints of damp wood. Smooth, full bodied texture. Pleasant caramel malt sweetness upfront. A refreshing juicy middle, tiny hints of chocolate. The hop is bold with a spicy/citrus hop bite towards the end. The finish has an earthy/ pine bitterness that leaves the palate pretty dry. This beer is strong yet very balanced. This sample was delicious. Perhaps my palate has matured. Perhaps the fact that I moved 3,000 miles away from getting a growler fill directly from the brewery on a weekly basis to not being able to purchase this beer in the state of CT has changed my opinion.

147,92,pavandal,4.03,"Poured into my mug from a bomber. Easily the coolest looking bottle I've ever had. beer poured a very hazy iced tea color, which I was not expecting. Couldn't see through it. a half inch head formed at the top of the glass with a creamy, bubbly look. The haze really detracted from the appearance for me...  ...But it made up for the look with the smell. I honestly smelled this for a few minutes before tasting. The smell was very citrus like, with lots of malt and hop spice.  As soon as you taste this your mouth is overtaken with hops, as I was expecting. It was balanced by a sweet malt backbone, but the hops are what this beer is all about. It had a very slight dark bread taste near the end, but again, the hops rule here.  An awesome beer to drink, it feels great in the mouth. Not super light, but light enough to make this an easy drinker.  High ABV, have a bomber and then stop.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,uabigdaz,3.83,"Upon pouring I was able to control the amount of head I desired in my glass, which is nice because sometimes beer that is too hoppy just explodes, as I'm sure we all have experienced.  Appearance is a nice rich medium dark brown. Looks like a dark amber beer. Beautiful lacing and retention. Head keeps the beer covered.  Smells strongly of hops. I detect a slight hint of something nutty and malty, but overwhelmingly hops.  Tastes pretty damn good. Wow, no wonder everyone has been trying to get me to taste this one. This is a beer lovers beer, someone who likes macro domestics will snuff this one. Stong taste of hops which is balanced nicely. Strong taste of hops again, but I'm a pale ale/ipa lover, so this is perfect. Very decent tasting beer.  Feels a little thin. Thats my only problem with this beer really. When I poured it it looked like it was going to be thick and creamy, and the head indicates this as well, however, when tasted, it is a very thin, watery sensation.  I'm not sure of the drinkability of this one. At 7.2% and a bottle that comes with more than a pint, one of these is plenty to ease my night. Poured for me about two glasses worth, although obviously not full pints, but nice enough servings to keep me happy.  If you have not tried this one, try it. If people have been telling you you would like this one, you will. I felt like it was going to be a hoaxy beer because of the name (and the price which was nearly 3 dollars for the bottle at CVS), but this is a legit beer. Try it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ppoitras,4.15,"22oz bottle purchased as a single from Yankee Spirits, MA.  Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" dark tan head over the clear burgundy red brew. Hearty holds on well, with ample lacing. Aroma is dominantly hoppy, with citrus and pine powering the experience. Taste starts a bit lacking in my mind, not as richly malty as I would expect. But never fear, the hops kick in a take over, with bursts of bitterness that impress, without making you cringe from overdoiung it. Mouthfeel is smooth for such a hoppy offering, and drinkability is dangerously good. Had this many times, just never got around to reviewing, reminds me why I keep coming back.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ByTor2112,4.08,"Poured a deep amber bordering on a nice shade of Brown with thick bubbles rising to a toffee colored head that maintained a nice solid film. Aroma-thick piney hops, a nice fruity citrus aroma, I get a nice peach note on a deep inhale. I drank one of these and did not review it back in September. First on the palate, surprise its hops! Not sharp but but a compact and fully layered taste. The malt can be tasted with a nice caramel flavor. A full spectrum of hops is tasted throughout from earthy to minty to bold to floral to a serious citrus zing! I really LIKE the AB but I find that I LOVE the IPA. Reviewers note: As I went to pour the last few ounces to my glass, I swirled quickly, foamed it up and poured it aggressively into my glass forming a huge head. I was able to drink a wonderful hops "" shake "" if you will. this is another killer way to experience the massive hop profile of this brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Beerzebub,4.25,"Dark red-orange color. With a vigorous pour, a finger of dense beige head. Goes down, but reappears with a gentle swirl. Substantial lace.  Smells like sweet malt, citrusy hops, dark fruit, brown sugar, some spice.  Big flavor, delicious. Rich sweet malt well balanced with orange rind, grapefruit, and pine hops. Some nutty roastiness. Very refreshing hop bitterness, and plenty of it. Long finish, mostly bitter citrusy hops.  Creamy carbonation, and somewhat sticky. Quite drinkable.  Great.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,MVassar,4.18,"Rich molasses appearance, with a touch of gold. An old-fashioned egg-cream head. Very enticing.  Smell: Doesn't share a lot, but some subtle caramel and malt. A hint of citrus.  Tons of flavor. Bitter hops and malt, with plenty of dark fruit and sweet caramel. A potent bitter grapefruit finish.  Very creamy, with lots of carbonation. Excellent, with a slightly rough edge.  A hearty, rich, full-bodied ale, with balance and power. Will happily drink again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The taste is very malty with a noticeable hop finishbalanced superbly. The mouthfeel is full and leaves a nice coating on the tongue that serves as a reminder of this delicious concoction. This is a very drinkable beer that is heavy enough to know you are having a real beer, but not too filling to keep it from being drunk at a proper pace.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,DrainBamage,3.91,"Pours a dark copper color and is semi-cloudy. Head is about a half an inch but settles down to a lace. Aroma is very fruity and sweet almost like candy. Goes down smooth tasting like grapefruit and is very bitter. It is pretty well carbonated also. I've got mixed feelings about this one. It says it's a strong ale, but could almost be passed off as a double IPA. I kinda like the fruity taste, but seems pretty bitter for a strong ale. This is the second Stone brew I've had and wasn't impressed with the first. It seems to be getting better after the first few sips. Maybe I'll have to review this again sometime.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,vwcraig,4.03,Had this on-tap at Rick's in Murrysville  Deep orange/brown color with big white head. Laces glass as it empties.  Smells like the Stone IPA with more intense citrus hop aroma.  The taste of this to me is punishing and abusive. Big punch in the mouth with resiny hop bite after a brief hint of initial sweetness.  Mouthfeel is heavy and thick. Coats the glass.  Drinkability varies based on tastes. Stone claims to have a brew that isn't for everybody with this one. And they are right; but that's why I like this beer. Couldn't have more than a couple of these and prefer food with this one. Will have another when I crave it.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The head is a good 2 fingers off white and leaves a nice lace.  The smell is BAM! up front hops. Piney!  The taste follows but is follows with a very nice malt to keep some kind of balance going on. I'm not saying this brew is well balanced, but the malt is big and in a DIPA if is needed.  The mouthfeel is good, nice and sticky thick, full body and very good carbonation.  The drinkability is good, could be a little better. But really a very good brew. prosit, MK",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,brewmaster411,3.03,"While American IPA and double IPA's are not my favorite style, Arrogant Bastard deserves renown for its chutzpah. You would say ""you are not worthy"" and expect the customer to drink it?  The beer is dark brown with a medium sized mostly lasting fizzy off white head, with a strong citrusy lemon lime hops aroma with some light piney perfumey hops as well, with light sweet caramel tones. Pineapple candy overall.  Taste was upfront strong grapefruit and moderate pine, with light nutty maltiness, followed by a dark breaded maltiness, somewhat bittersweet, followed by a second front of hops, this time harshly grapefruit in nature, followed by an herbal, tea-like bitter hops, licorice, and the same sweet gelatineous lingering finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, slightly creamy, fizzy and moderately astringent.  Overall, the nose is spellbinding, the appearance good. The balance of hops to malt seems such to enliven the hops, but to not let it get overly out of character. Perfect in that sense. The finish is rich with flavors, but I would have liked to see a bit more complexity on the foretaste though. Excellent overall.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,dragonofblood,5,"This is my favourite beer in the world, from my favourite brewery in the world. Hence it gets a perfect rating from me.  Appearance: Poured from a 22 oz. bottle with that arrogant gargoyle leering at me, daring me to drink his beer. The beer pours a dark red colour with a slightly off-white head. The lacing sticks to the glass like molasses.  Smell: Very, very complex. Incredibly hoppy on the first smell, full of piney notes that give way to a citrusy hop aroma. Small aromas of caramel malt and alcohol are also noticeable. The smell is layered and it takes a couple good whiffs to sort through it all. Absolutely delicious.  Taste: Wow. The first time I tried this beer I was blown away. Not as full bodied as you'd expect, more of a middle of the road body. The first flavour you experience is a massive piney, resiny hop flavour, which the nose revealed would be there, with a subtle grapefuit/citrus hop flavour playing the role of the back up band. The hops give way to a beautiful malt sweetness, full of roasted caramel flavours. The alcohol lends a tingling feeling to the tongue after each mouthful which fades rather quickly and never becomes unpleasant. Perfection.  Mouthfeel: Smooth with a moderate carbonation and a medium body with a slight mouth-coating effect.  Drinkability: I could drink this, and only this, for the rest of my life and be a completely happy and content man. I don't think I can say that for any other beer on the planet. In other words the drinkability is like everything else about this beer, perfect.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Head about 1/4"" but quickly dissipates, something that I see a lot in higher alcohol beers.  Taste is good, a little too much alcohol from my taste. Orangey and fruit.  The drinkability rates high for this much alcohol but low in general simply because  Double Bastard is way better.

M - Nice and thick. Almost creamy mouthfeel. Goes down smooth.  D - smooth drinking and goes down easy. The first few sips was a little wtf...but after half the glass, the taste really shines.

The smell featured a strong oily citrus hop with a mildly sweet caramel malt aroma.  The taste was very well balanced. A solid sweet grain was perfectly balanced by the resiny citrus and peppery hop.

Nice intermittent ridges of lacing.  Smell was malty rich, oakey and woody with some hops lurking in the background.  The taste was intense and complex. On the front end, the beer was malty and somewhat sweet, with noticeable notes of maple syrup. Quickly however, the hops took over and destroyed everything in its path. Hops were quite piney and resinous, and they crescendoed as they moved along the palate. Huge hop bite on the back of the palate. The hops at this point felt sticky. Strong, resonating, hoppy and bitter finish.  Mouthfeel was full-bodied, creamy and smooth.  At 7.2% ABV, the alcohol was hardly detectable.

147,92,CortexBomb,4.11,"Pour is exceptionally dark brown, reminds me of syrup in colour. Nice, very thick tan head on top, huge. Nose is largely roasted malt (light, not stouty) and floral hops.  Taste starts out nice and sweetly malty, then the hops show up with pine grapefruit effects on the back of the tongue. Roasted malts then show up about midway for a short cameo, and finally, some more of those hops do a nice closing routine with a hint of alcohol. Depthy and interesting. Nice lingering flavour like an imperial stout gives this one an extra 1/2 a point.  Mouth on this is good, full, creamy, good bitters. The drinkability on this one is solid, if not completely remarkable. No problem drinking it though.  Bottom line: Very solid beer, a lot of depth, and quite well balanced. It has some aggressive hop moments, but it always manages to bring them back into balance before they get entirely out of control. An impressive effort.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,SupaCelt,3.03,"This brutal little number poured out with a very nice looking colour that was crimson to purple. It formed a substantial creamy head of tan that held nicely and left gobs of lacing as the drink was drunk.  The nose is nicely arranged with fresh floral hoppiness. It is somewhat grassy and herbal, but mostly citrus bloom. The malt character underneath smells potent and mixes with a biting alcohol scent to throw some roughness on the pile. Crusty. Stinging. Astringent. But a lovely bloom of hoppiness.  The taste is not all that special. I think it is a bit abrasive for my tastes. I have no problem with the decent amount of hop character displayed here. In fact, that is the saving grace for this brew. It has a crusty and biting side to it that is not all that appealing to me. I guess I am not worthy, but this is just not my style. It just feels dirty and brutal save for the hops. This feels more assaultive than many huge brews that I've had. Astringent.  Mouthfeel is good. It has a nice body to it. It is just wasted on a sort of wild charactered brew. Coats the mouth nicely and the head throws off some creaminess.  The drinkability is average. I see no reason to drink this when there are beers that are much less offensive that have a true style to them. By far the worst Stone beer that gets the most press and praise. The strong ale catch all is just not a solid situation. I prefer structure. This is a bit messy for me. If this thing were about 14% abv, I think I would be more appreciative of it because I could forgive some of the harsh abrasiveness. As it stands it tastes like a monster only it is not really that strong considering. This beer has a great name. I wish it deserved to be so arrogant though. I think some people have been punked out by the smack talk on the bottle. Nice Jedi mind tricks. Stone's other products are much more deserving of the praise. They make some truly stellar beers. That being said, I am not feeling this one and I will not pretend to be.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,joe1510,4.03,"22oz. Bomber  Arrogant Bastard poured a deep, dark ruby with a 2 finger creamy light tan head. The moderate lacing is good and sticky. This beer glows when held to the light. The glow of this beer adds a lot to the appearance along with the lasting head.  Smells juicy. There is a great big grapefruit bitterness smell. It's strange but I also pick up celery stalk. I never noticed that in other bottles I've had. There's a solid malt backbone that's actually pretty complex. Some lightly roasted grains and white toast among other, less aromatic, aromas. As it warms alcohol fumes rise into my nose.  Oh, the taste!... Toasty grains and mild caramel make the initial appearance. The malts fades to the background as the delicious bitter grapefruit hops take over the palate. After a strong bite the hops simmer down to a moderate bitterness and the grains come back for a night cap with a stronger showing of the caramel the second time around. The bitterness lingers around for a little while after each drink. This beer isn't polished. There are a lot of rough edges that go together seamlessly. Alcohol fumes come through as it warms and they just add more complexity to this drink. Lot's of interesting flavors. Very nice.  Mouthfeel is good. Medium bodied and very smooth. Leaves with a little grittiness. Carbonation keeps it pushing through and the tongue takes a beating from the big amount of hops. Just the way I like it.  Drinkability is good for the fact of how good this beer actually tastes. I don't think I'd want to drink much more than a 22 in a sitting but it definately is good.  This is an excelent brew with all kinds of big flavors that go together wonderfully. Stone needs to get to Illinois as soon as possible. Another excellent beer from them.

147,92,EPseja,4.83,"On the eve following the first frost in Westwood, NJ for the autumn of 2006, the Arrogant Bastard finally finds its way to my lips... if only to take the chill out of the evening air.  Served from an exquisitely screen printed 22oz bomber at just below cellar temperature into a Duvel tulip -- my tasting glass of choice.  A - Medium brown coming out of the bottle, transforming into a very lightly hazed, smog-filtered sunset blazing red-orange. The airy, tan colored head explodes toward the upper flare of the glass, rising a good three inches before sitting put. The bubbles below the head's surface range from tiny to huge, and they all buoy up the rocky, fluffy and inconsistently bubbled crown. The lacing immediately sets up, leaving sticky, volcanic crags etched against the sides of the glass. If my words didn't give it away, I'll say it plainly: perfect.  S - West-coast hoppiness presented as an orange-blossom wreath atop a Cascade mountain pine tree with drippy sweet malt-sap covered pinecones. Warm and chilly at the same time, earthy and heady. Wonderful!  T - Superbly round, warm and supple mudium-toasted maltiness starts you out as it hits the tip of the tongue. A transformation then takes place that squeezes out a flowery, honey-laden juiciness as it continues on towards the back of the tongue where the hops begin their dance. A bitterness starts to grow that just falls short of ruining the delicate balance... everything remains in check. The aftertaste is that of toasted pretzel sticks and hoppy bitterness that works together to tell your brain that it's time for another sip as your belly warms and your inhibitions slip into the shadows.  M - With only a trace of tingle on the tongue, the beer flows into the mouth, like the low grade angle flow of water across a sheet of glass. It grows ever so slightly in the mouth to become a creamy, frothy delight as it slips and slides down the gullet and into my eager stomach.  D - There is no denying that this beer is worthy of every accolade it has thus received from all other raters, and now me. Smooth and delicious, but full of bold and assertive flavor -- as well as alcohol! Be careful. This beer may be good, but it's still a Bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Thick sheets of layered lovely lace.  Ultra fresh scents of sweet French burnt candied peanuts which showcase a hearty malt presence and of course, a blossoming bouquet of hops galore. The balance of these two fresh components is staggering, can't wait to taste it...  Ahhh! The slightly prickly and grapefruit rind flavored hops greet you with a friendly handshake. The sweet malt I received in the nose is a little tamer than I expected, but sturdy none-the-less. Again, the balanced components of malt & hop are expertly displayed. The gentle sweetness of the malts permit the dry and succulently bitter hops to really shine.  Mouthfeel is very nice. The slow rising visible carbonation is very indicative in the mouthfeel; restrained and fine carbonation really showcase the graceful full flavored long finish.  Drinkability is insane. I can't for the life of me think of a scenario where this beer wouldn't perfectly fit-in. I'm sad I only bought one bomber.  Overall a very graceful and gentle ale that doesn't reflect its name at all. Don't get me wrong, this ale can throw haymakers with the best of them, but I'm very impressed with its remarkable balance and pleasant demeanor.

After the chicken wings, cleaning up our filthy faces, and rinsing out our mouths, it was time to crack it open.  Poured a deep amber with a creamy beige head. Smelled of caramel maltiness, apples?, and citrus hops. Great smelling beer.  Then came the taste test. This is where it all gets a tad hairy. First I would like to say that the beer does get a little smoother, rounding out the biscuity maltiness, as the beer warms up a little bit. With that said, upon sipping the beer, you get notes of caramel, biscuity, very flavorful malty goodness with some hops poking through...then BAM! the maltiness dissapears and you get smacked upside the head with a huge astringent hop blast. Very aspiriny hop punch like that of Amarillo hops. Very dry, total hop-dominant finish. This beer is NOT smooth at all and that is it's downfall. The Bastard is too uneven and the flavors dont mesh well. Like I said, as it warms, it gets a little bit more even and smooths out a bit but not too much.  Mouthfeel is good, not overly carbonated but the drinkability isn't really there. This beer could be an EXCELLENT brew, and live up to it's hype, if it was just smoother and not so uneven -- but that's just my opinion. It's still much better than most beers out there.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,badbeer,3.65,"Poured a reddish brown color with a white head leaving a little lacing. Smell is full of piney hops, there's definately a strong malt base, but this is hops all the way. Taste starts a little sweet with some caramel, but is quickly full of piney hops. Pretty good. Medium bodied, higher carbonation. Once again, pretty good, and is worth a try.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,GimpyCane,4.47,"I really enjoyed this brew the first time I had it and I'm still enjoying it after drinking it many times. Aggressively poured a three inch frothy light brown head w/ a cloudy dark amber/ caramel hue. The head last throughout the drink and left good amount of lacing. The aroma was outstanding. Heavy malt/ caramel and a moderate piney or perfume hop. Although this brew is an American Strong Ale, the amount of hops would make you think its a IPA. (YUM). Finally, when I taste. It began w/ a moderate sweet caramel and had a long lasting heavy citrus hop ending. The bastard has a nice medium body, watery and lively feel to it. IMO this brew rocks, but it could turn many drinkers off. If your a hophead, I recommend this brew. Enjoy",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jeffjfindley,4.1,"Appearance: Deep cherry in color, with a one finger head that dissipates after a minute or two. Eventually you are left with a ring around the glass and very light lacing in the middle.  Smell: Dominated by hops, but if you look hard enough you'll pick up a nice fruity texture, and a surprisingly grassy freshness.  Taste: Sweetness is the first to arrive, exhibiting some fruitiness and a touch of caramel. The hops kick this in the ass after about 1.5 seconds. The hop profile is absolutely massive, and grows as the flavor matures on your tongue. Flavor becomes more balanced toward the fruity end as the glass warms a bit.  Mouthfeel: Satisfying maltiness and a predictably dry hop-bite at the finish.  Drinkability: I discovered this gem at Murphy's in Prescott, AZ in 2000. I saw it on the beer list, and thought the name was hysterical so I had to order one. I quickly realized that this was no mere novelty beer. This is by no means for the faint of heart, but if you're up to it, I think you'll find this to be very quaffable for a brew of this magnitude.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,TheBeerWolf,4.53,"Let me just say right now this review may be a bit biased. My beer drinking ""journey"" started with this beer and I always find myself coming back to it. And I will declare right now Stone is my favorite beer company. Thier beers are not for the timid, the gargoyle has just punched me in the nuts a few times but of course he helps you up and burshes you off. In general all of the stone beers are pretty strong and this one started the tradition I think. Well anyway on to the arrogant bastard! Pours a dark cherry with a very light tan head that stays and laces very well. The smell is hops, alcohol and citrus fruits. A complex tate the hops jump out but I also pick out peach, dark fruits, fresh bread, and the alcohol sting just in the background. The mouthfeel is pretty thick but enjoyable. Not a chore to drink at all! At least for me. I could drink this stuff all night but after more then 2 bombers I would need to take a cab. As I said before stone is truly one of my favorite beer companies and I always love trying thier special releases. And they never let me down! Thier beer is always good and strong! This beer gave me an appreciation for craft beers in general so I do owe it somewhat of a debt. Never a bad choise but if your looking for something ""lighter"" then go with something rogue and don't mess with the gargoyle!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,uberabr,4.49,"Found this beer at a local wine store tonight, what a nice surprise. Poured from bottle into a tulip. Dark red brown with some gold hues, average carbonation. Surprisingly thick, creamy head with good lace. A good centimeter of fluff lasted all the way through.  Wow, the aroma is truly amazing! Subtle for its complexity. You have to stick around and give it a chance, but it doesnt exactly have to twist your arm, either. Grassy. Clear, strong, and very fruity. Passion fruit, guava, and mango. Definitely some grapefruit, some more citrus is there, but not overbearing. Also a distinct berry sweetness, cherry and cranberry. A little pumpkin too, kind of zesty.  Tastes a bold, hoppy, somewhat bitter roasted caramel malt. Mouthfeel is excellent, bold but adequately watery with just the right carbonation and hoppy after-bite. The fruits are still there but the alcohol taste is stronger Perhaps a little too strong for this AbV, but Im already sold by this point. It really is an arrogant bastard. Good beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,msubulldog25,4.15,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a pint glass. It's been a while (more than 1 year) since I last had this beer.  A: Murky red-brown with a chunky 1/2 finger tan head. Small carbonation percolates to the top, where the head faded to a sliver of film. A velvety curtain of lace pulls the score up to a solid '4'.  S: Grassy hops get top billing but a nice balance of maltiness keeps them in check. Some hints of dry fruit and a subtle roastedness.  T: Loads of flavor. Very hop-forward but with a malty, lightly sweet caramel backbone. Some of that ripe fruit sneaks in and gives a tang and richness. Finish is mostly bitter.  M: Quite a full mouthfeel. Lingering toasted malt and bitter hops. Clingy - to the point of feeling sticky or gummy. Causes some salivation. I don't hate the mouthfeel but don't love it either.  D: A good beer...under the right conditions, a great beer. Tonight, this beer was hitting me as a little too bitter and sticky. A bomber took a long time to finish, though it was enjoyable and is definitely recommended.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,stouty1,4.55,"Ruby red pour with a nice fluffy white head whic leaves a nice fine lacing around the rim. Smells of hops and some berries. A hint of alcohol when you really get down into it.  Tastes like hops and a small bit of malt. Sweet hops with just a touch of bitterness. Leaves a nice ""you had ahoppy beer"" in your mouth.  Slight thickness in the mouth but defintely not chewy. Just enough to savor the flavor. Definitely a worthwhile brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,bkett01,3.96,"Pours a murky ruby red covered with a dusty brown head. Amazingly dark for an ale, warns of the complexity of the beer. Smell is very malt dominated, can't even detect hops. Tastes of sweet malt with hints of molasses and caramel. A brief bite of hops makes an appearance in the finish, rounding out an amazingly intense taste in every sip. I remember trying this beer years ago when I was still into BMC, and not being able to handle all the flavor. It's great to look back and see how this is the epitome of craft beer in how much really goes into it. A bastard among the rest, this one speaks for itself.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Drew966,4.17,"Arrogant Bastard Ale pours a dark reddish brown with a thin off white head. This is a really good, aromatic beer. Hops dominate the aroma, but there are esters noticeable too. Taste is definitely heavy on the hops, but the malt is doing a fairly good job of balancing it out. There is an estery, almost metallic flavor near the end. This was an older sample, I'd say it would only be better fresh, with stronger hop flavors.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,InsolublePancake,4.43,"Another classic that must be reviewed!  A- Simply beautiful. Deep ruby red with a big tan head and fabulous lacing. If nothing else, this beer is gorgeous!  S- Quite fruity. I can pick up apples, pears, and oranges along with other citrusy, hoppy aromas. Caramel malts are also present, along with a bit of a roasty smell. The smells are blended so well together that it's tough to pick out the hops and the malts, although it's obvious that both are present in vast quantities.  T- Wow, quite unique. Once again, it's tough to separate the malts and the hops, they're so well blended. The flavors meld quite well together. A fruitiness similar to the smell is apparent with pomacious fruits, a sort of apple-like flavor that is fairly unique to any beer that I've had; it's somewhat similar to a hard cider. There's also a vinous quality to it, kind of like an off-dry white like a Suavignon Blanc. Whatever, it's quite complex and quite nice. Quite bitter in the finish, which for me just adds to the appeal.  M- Full, thick and rich. Very enjoyable.  D- Based on the flavor and overall appeal of this beer I'd have to rate the drinkability rather high, but it is pretty alcoholic and complex. This is really a beer that should be drunk slowly and savored rather than quaffed. I'd have another, but probably not more than two.  What a fantastic beer! I'd had this a couple times before and thought it was good, but not this good. I guess my palate has developed enough that I can truly appreciate it. This beer is quite common in my area, so I tend to overlook it in favor of more exotic options. That's a mistake on my part. Truly a great beer that often gets overlooked due to its abundance and hype. Marketing tactics aside, this beer kicks ass! Highly recommended.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BigRedN,4.33,"Finally had an Arrogant Bastard on trip to Ft. Worth, TX. From notes.  Appearance: Poured from 22 oz bomber into a pint glass (actually more than one pour). The beer is a dark amber, close to brown in color. A 1/2 inch off white head sits atop the liquid, lingers for a while before settling to a solid covering. Good lacing as the beer is consumed.  Smell: Big hoppy aroma, a little piney and floral. Nice little roasted malt as well. Decent balance but hops win out.  Taste: Amazing balance. Rich, chewy malts followed by strong hop presence which really took control as the beer warmed. Just about the best beer of the trip.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full in body. A little chewy and dry. The high alcohol content is well hidden.  Drinkability: Deceptively easy to drink, dangerous with the 7%+ alcohol content. Wish I could get this in Nebraska. Texas BAs should not complain too loudly, as they can at least get this.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Good strong smell of malt with citrus mabey grapefruit. Smell doesn't show the true hops that are in this beer. Great ballance, this beer smells good. Taste like nectar from heaven. A good malty, piney, begining then with a sweet, grapefruit again middle. The hops are present the whole way through but especially after. A very thick coating ale by all means. Not all good things last as long as AB ale. I know I have many more beers to try, but right now this is very close if not at the top of my list. If you haven't you should ASAP.

The nose is of light grapefruit and pine (light for an IPA, anyway), with lots of caramel sweetness. The taste starts with strong bitterness and hop flavor, which fades quickly to a sweet caramel finish. Nice citrus notes. This beer is really balanced! Has a medium-low mouthfeel, with medium carbonation. Reminds me of a jacked-up ESB somehow.

147,92,vanrassel,4.32,"I brought back a 650 mL bottle from a recent trip to San Diego (three days before the strict new airline carry-on restrictions went into effect) and had a chance to see what all the acclaim is about. It's well-earned.  It poured into my pint glass with a large, three-finger head over a dark amber/ruby body. It was a little cold coming out of the fridge, so I let it sit for awhile and marvelled at the head's unbelievable staying power. The warmth also brought out an incredibly complex aroma of pine, citrus and a hint of floral hops as well. You can smell a bit of caramel, but only a whiff.  The malt backbone of this beer revealed itself in the taste, which started with a bready fullness and caramel sweetness up front. Then came the bitterness, oh, the wonderful bitterness: it started piney and citric (all at once, it seemed) ended dry, sharp and crisp. The carbonation and full body made it lively going down and it created a nice alcoholic warming in my belly.  Anyone familiar with this beer has no doubt seen the brewers' tongue-in-cheek ""You probably won't like it,"" warning on the back. What a bunch of arrogant bastards!

M- Leaves your mouth dry as a bone. *Gasp* This sure is a bastard...  D- I didn't really enjoy this beer.

Creamy and porous, lightly tan head that keeps most of its strength along the snifter's sides. Thin, webbed lacing with impressive strength.  Strong hop aromas: grapefruit, melon, lime, and apple. Very faint, underlying semi-sweet caramel malt. Hints of alcohol combined with the citrus and tropical fruit make for a pleasant tartness.  Apples, lime, grapefruit; tartness right up front. Oily with some aggressive hop resin. Very evident alcohol presence at mid-sip adding a slickness to the hops and fruit flavors. Faint milk chocolate, toffee that turns dry and nutty with an aggressive hop bite. The aftertaste is filled with alcohol, aged fruit, and bitterness.  Full in body; gritty from the hops, but slick from the alcohol presence. Well rounded mouthfeel to balance such an array of intense flavors.  A unique concoction that's both intense and aggressive to the tastebuds. This one's best enjoyed shared and savored.

The presentation is quite nice with a deep auburn color from the bomber to the pint glass. A thick head with tons of lacing that lasts forever. A very powerful and complex aroma with all kinds of components: various malts chocolate, spice, florals, with an alcohol kick and very aggressive hop finish without being overly bitter. Better than I remember. Mouthfeel is perfectly suited to the taste medium body with no more and no less than it needs. Drinkability for 1 or 2 is great but beyond that the alcohol and body limit the sessioning prospects.

147,92,BlackJeremiah,4.62,"This is very special. I've had AB many, many times, but this will be my first AB since I quit smoking--I'm curious about the effect on my perception. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into an AB pint glass.  A: Deep ruby red when held up to the light. Great head, about 1 1/2"", like puffy clouds, leaving slight lacing.  S: Deep, sweet malt with light scents of citrus and pine. Swirling brings out bread/biscuit, pistachio, and mandarin orange. A great array of scents, with a faint souciant of alcohol.  T: A crisp citric bite, but then roasty, really, really malty and smoky. Then the citrus (grapefruit) returns, mingled with aromatic floral notes that dance on your palate. The aftertaste is drying, sweet-tasting, and slightly floral.  M: Medium-bodied, goes down really easily. The hops and roastiness may assault your palate a bit, but the dry quality ensures refreshment.  D: Still one of my favorite beers, in terms of this category. The flavors are so well-mingled, it's very crisp and refreshing. It's excessive, sure, but that doesn't mean it doesn't drink well.  Personal note: The increased level of my smell and taste since I quit smoking is incredible.

There is an initial hops spicy bite to the taste but that settles into a sweet hops malt blend that finishes well. It has a creamy feel with a clean finish.

Solid blanket on top of the beer surface.  S: Malty-sweet and a copious amount of hops. Hint of celery, bit of caramel. Mostly hop resins and pineyness.  T/M: Has plentiful roasty flavors up front with some sweet, almost smoky, maltiness. Maltiness gives way to some dry grain. A hint of a citrus kick, and some caramel flavors, too. Finish is strong, bitter, and has a long, bitter tail. Lot going on here.  D: Wow. The copy on the bottle has made the rounds around here, and that was my introduction to this beer (""you probably won't like this beer""). But this is strong stuff, really bold and assertive, and is a great way to get a hop fix, even if you're not a huge hophead (like me).

I have never experienced a beer with so much hops...

147,92,dblinkhorn,4.25,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into the Stone Old Guardian Barley Wine specialty glass.  Appearance - A two finger brownish tan head that is soapy at first and slowly settles to a smooth one finger cap that remains. The lacing is full-coverage all the way down. The color of the beer is a very deep reddish amber with very slight haze.  Smell - Smells very similar to an old ale in style. The hop aroma is crisp and citrusy with notes of bitterness and a slight fruitiness (grapefruit, orange, plum, etc.). A very rich slightly toasted and biscuity malt smell ties it all together. There is moderate alcohol burn on the nose.  Taste - It opens (deceivingly) with a smooth and balanced taste of some citrusy bitter hops, a nice grapefruit flavor as well, and a rich bready malt background. Then you swallow, exhale, come into the finish and this sucker explodes with flavor and character. A super bitter hops flavor (and again grapefruit, like biting right into a fresh one) commands your taste buds, and very soon it slightly mellow giving way to some earthy and bready maltiness. The aftertaste is hops bitterness and a moderate earthiness. A slight alcohol sensation is present throughout the entire taste, but your attention is drawn away from this from the outstanding flavors.  Mouthfeel - Smooth greeting from the carbonation with a slight bite just a bit into the taste. The liquid is medium-bodied and fairly smooth (although it is difficult to fully contemplate the mouthfeel with such a powerful flavor).  Drinkability - One 22 oz bottle of this stuff is the limit that my taste buds can handle from this powerful ale.  An instant classic, that has become somewhat of a novelty beer. Regardless, it has superb flavors and a good mouthfeel. A must have!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The color is a dark amber with a plum hue. The off-white head is frothy and creamy with good retention. Substantial, sticky lacing clings to the glass.  The nose is not all that strong--can pick up traces of hops, caramel malt, yeast, and plum. The flavor is of roasted malts, yeast, and barley, plum and berry, a touch of candy, phenols, and very astringent hops. The mouth is full-bodied and dense.

Hearty roasted taste that's slightly nutty with some fruitiness to it. Alcohol taste with hints of caramel. Not a lot of hop taste. A twangy sharp finish that leaves my mouth extremely dry.

Good thing I work in a bar with great beer on tap. I actually have tried to get my friends to try this and you know the response I get.

Still, I found the stuff *on tap* at RFD in Wash., DC, and (IMHO), surely that makes a review worth more, doesn't it?  Served in a pint tumbler, its color reminded me of whiskey, minimal head. But the NOSE was oh so promising, a wonderful hop bouquet, malty with citrus notes.  As for taste, it's concentrated hop goodness, a smooth, grayish, high-octane, mega-IBU, high, loud note of beerness. Well balanced, the malts, and (super) hops all blend well, the alcohol is well concealed. It finishes persistently bitter with lingering grain flavors. Quite satisfying.  Mouthfeel is malt-sticky, massively astringent, a kind of creaminess if beer can be creamy. Full bodied, lots going on here. Drinkability: It sips great, goes down easy, but beware, it kicks.

Flavor is complex hop bitterness and flavor, then carmel like malt flavor. The hop bitterness does seem to overwhelm everything else though. Mouthfeel is medium to full with noticeable alcohol burn in my throat after a few drinks. The bitterness seems a bit out of balance for my taste, but its still an ok beer. I think it is a little overrated.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,RedChrome,4.42,"This pour produced a medium brown color with very nice vibrant red hues. A half inch eggshell colored head stayed a few minutes before shrink to slick the top. Very little carbonation bubbling. Nice wispy clumps of lacing.  A very strong aroma of roasted barley. There is a light wooded scent that reminds me of sawdust. A subtle but pleasing scent of hops was able to be deteted in a second whiff. As it warms a light citrus blend can also be noticed.  Has an initial taste of burnt bread. A finish of the first taste brought a nice hops kick. A very nice second taste had a blend of citurs and woody flavors. Flavor changes as it warms, and runs from what was mention and also includes a light butterscotch and caramel blend. A light alcohol note can be detected as this one finishes on the back of the tongue.  A very nice thick feel in the mouth. A decent kick of carbonation on the tongue helps you appreciate the multitude of flavors. Nice amount of taste hangs on the surfaces.  A fantastic offering. A friend brought me this back from a trip to California, and now, I am begging her to go back. Would go very well to start of with the appetizers at an italian eatery.

147,92,kkosmoski,4.32,"Served from a 22oz. bomber  Appearance - medium brown, bright red if held up to the light, in color with a nice thick, cream-colored head. The head settles down, but remains almost the whole way through. Great stick to the sides of the glass.  Smell - very strong aroma to this beer with many complex smells going on, but I would say that the malt is dominating over the hops in smell  Taste - bitter to start out, I think both from the large amount of hops and fraction of roasted malt in the brew. Malt definately holds up to the challenging bitterness throughout and starts to break though midway and into the finish. The respectable alcohol content also shows its face toward the end. Many different malts in the grain bill.  Mouthfeel - good level of carbonation - not over the top - very full-bodied  Drinkability - Definately do not drink this beer if you are planning on trying anything else in the same session. It is the most strongly-flavored brew I think that I have ever had. Lots of in-your-face flavors going on. A very intimidating beer for drinkers who are used to lighter-bodied and less flavorful brew. I won't be having much in one sitting, although it is a great flavorful beer to end on.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,flexabull,4.13,"The ever popular Arrogant Bastard.  Deep and dark amber color, with a 1/2 inch thick white head.  Has a smell to me that is similar to a lot of barleywines. Deep dark fig and baked bread smells with a hint of hops. The smell is just toned down a bit from a barleywine.  This beer has an excellent mouthfeel. You taste the flavors all over your mouth, and the finish is long and lingering.  Flavors of piney hops, and slight amount of alcohol, along with a matly fruity somewhat crisp finish.  Certainly a beer you can't go wrong with, but it's best to probably only have one or two.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,peabody,3.58,Pours out like ice tea with 1/2 finger of off-white foam which dissapates quickly. No lacing to speak of. Has an orange/apple peel smell with yeast and malt evident. First taste is dark and bitter. Very little alcohol is present and the hops are in rare form. Reminds me of a bitter coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is rather bland for a Stone offering. Only the hops remain in the mouth. Other than the hops it remains a very clean aftertaste. I couldn't see myself drinking too many of these at one sitting but I can see where you might get addicted to this bitterness.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BeerNutta,4.17,Arrogant Bastard  A = Poured a dark orange/brown colour with a light brown head. Kinda looks as if you mixed fanta with coke.  S = Strong aroma of hops.  T = Initial sweet sugary taste which then gives way to a strong hop taste. Then its hops all the way with a slight caramel backing.  M = Moderately carbonated to give a crisp refreshing feel. Hop bite does give you a kick in the teeth feeling. Leaves a fuzzy coating on your teeth.  D = Very drinkable. But I don't think I could drink too many of these in one session.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,rgrace99,4.7,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. Big, thick head with lots of lacing. Color was a deep red almost brown and translucent. Aroma was like walking through a pine forest. Taste was a wonderful, sweet malt taste with a strong hop presence in the back of the throat, finishing with a strong hop bitterness. Very easy to put down but dangerous to put back more than one with the high ABV. Awesome, awesome beer!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,RonfromJersey,4.63,"Review # 500.  Nice painted bomber. Great, sarcastic ""liner notes"" (what do you call the ""extra"" writings on a beer label ?).  Ah, to finally use my Arrogant Bastard glass. Bold red body, excellent clarity. Multiple slow streams of fine carbonation. Four full fingers of oatmeal colored bubbly foam.  Aoma is a thick pine forest, and at the end of the woods, a citrus grove, and down the road in the farmhouse, fresh bread in the oven. Just not as big as I had anticipated.  A stunningly deep, malty, caramelly, semi-sweet chocolate beginning lays down a bedrock foundation. Then, as it seems that last drop of sweet liquid has dropped down the throat, a mushroom cloud of hoppy bitterness seemingly rises out of the gullet, scraping away any sweetness with a gentle abrasive. The bitterness lingers long and proud, like a slowly receding tide on a late summer day.  Solid medium mouthfeel, seems like it wants to get to full but can't quite reach it.  Drinkability is flat out wonderful. Invites long pulls. Be gone in a second if i wasn't deliberately pausing to savor the hoppy afterglows.  Lived up to the hype. Big and balanced, wonderfully constructed. I'll be arrogant and call myself worthy. The beer is worthy too.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Estarrio,4.42,"Second review. This was the bottled version, while my previous review was on tap.  Appearance is similar to the draft but I found the head to be smaller, with less retention. Same dark, ruby red color.  Aroma seems to have a little less pine. Still a big Christmas tree smell with some sweet malt characteristics to balance.  This is sweeter than the last few bottles Ive had. I was surprised to find it being just as sweet as the draft version. Have they tweaked the recipe? Tastes of sweet caramel, grapefruit and piney hops. More citrus and less pine than the draft version. A little tamer in my opinion. Very well balanced.  Excellent mouth feel and highly drinkable. I prefer the draft version but this is still a very fine brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,TheLiterati,4.82,"Ive enjoyed this ale on several occasions and thought it was high time that I actually review this brew.  Pours an absolutely lovely mahogany with golden highlights, with a rich, tan, two finger high head that dissipates slowly and hangs around in a slightly diminished state for the entire time this brew sits in the glass.  Smells overwhelmingly of grapefruit, with some amazingly scorched, woodsy undertones. Taken individually, none of these aromas would be particularly pleasant, but they work quite well in concert in my glass!  Tastes of big, bad hops with all the characteristics of the aroma translated to the flavor. This is a beer that tells you what its made of right up front, and dares to deliver. If youre a hophead, you will not be disappointed.  The mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth and velvety, with just the right amount of effervescence to tickle the palate and leave you absolutely begging for more.

Head was persistent and left thick rings of lace. Easily wins a 5 for appearance.  Aroma was surprisingly subdued hops.  Taste was strongly bitter, yet sweet. Mildly fruity, with some carmel maltiness. Bold piney, citrusy hop flavors. Alcohol becomes apparent as it warms, but is otherwise well hidden. Bitterness and a ghost of the flavor lingers a long while.  Good mouthfeel and body without being syrupy. Just right carbonation.  Easily put away a 22 oz. bomber.

Taste of fruity hops, cherry malty and a strong bitter finish.  Wow, this stuff is awesome. Very complex and strong in flavor. Don't make the same mistake I did, and make it your first beer in a tasting. It put my palate in a head lock for a while, the taste was just lingering.  Definitely recommended.

The m/f is medium and very well balanced. Some Strong Ales are are way too ""syrupy"", but this is smooth and it hides the alcohol well.

Medium bodied with light carbonation. The feel is acidic, yet finishes clean. It's easy to finish the 1.6pt bomber.  Drink one, or drink five, it doesn't matter.

From the moment it hits your mouth there are several flavors that come across, malted caramel, cherries? and very slight citrus of some sort.  Where this ale really earns its stripes is the finish, with so many complex flavors, they have hopped it perfectly to allow them all to be rounded out without an overpowering hop finish.

S - The aroma is more sweet than anything - there is hop aroma there but the sweet malt is the dominant smell. Caramel, fruits, hops... it's all there.  T - It's sweet, fruity, and hoppy in a complex but very appealing way. The funny thing is I had this beer about a year ago and didn't really care for it - I've since become more of a hophead and now this tastes incredible. Funny how a palette can change like that. Sweet in the front, maybe a little roastedness in the back and as I breath out - I get cherry like fruit flavor/aroma's in my mouth. The hops are definitely there and the bitterness rounds out the sweet malts nicely.  M - Medium bodied, somewhat of a creamy texture to it. Carbonation is moderate.  D - This is a great tasting beer.

Pours a very dark crimson head with a thick beige head that slowly fades away into light lacing around the glass.  Smells of rich caramel malts followed by the bitter citrusy hops that this beer is known for.  Yes, the hops in this are almost overwhelming, but this is truly a well-balanced brew, with the sweet roasted/caramel hops just as strong. The fact that both flavors can both be so rich, yet coexist peacefully (and deliciously) with one another is what makes this brew such a legend.  Medium-bodied mouthfeel, but the drinkability suffers due to the strength of the hops. Although not nearly as bitter as the Ruination IPA, this is definitely one for the hopheads.

Dark, ruby red/brown tint with a caramel colored head that leaves uber Belgian-like amounts of lacing and never dissipates throughout being drunk. Probably has the best head retention I've ever seen out of a pint glass. The smell is actually pretty sweet, not bitter like the bottle and company suggests. Very cocoa and caramel like. The taste is the amazing part. The 7.2% is very well hidden leaving you to actually be able to scarf some arrogance down fairly fast, but why would you do that anyways?...Many, many different flavors bombarding your mouth at once. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy, but not sticky, which is perfect for me. Creamy once you get to the head. In fact, about the last 1% of the pour is pure cream. Awesome.

T - It's like a battle going down in my mouth.... hoppy like whoa, and citrus and pine, and strong caramel malts as well. A little less dry than I expected for the somewhat high abv.

Nose is aggressive indeed. Strong hop notes, piney and some sour citrus. This is balanced by a thick, warm malt character. Smells terrific and in no way simple. Palate is likewise -- both thick, mouth-coating caramel malts with biting, resinous hops darting around. Complex palate that is so very complex. What is this beer? Falls into the elusive ""strong ale"" category. In other words, we don't know what it is, but it's something to be reckoned with ... Mouthfeel is thick and both smooth and biting.

I normally keep interesting bottles for my homebrew, but I have a few of these I just keep to display. :-)  Color of this beer is deep copper, almost brown, with a bright white, thin head.  The smell has a musky, earth note that is very pleasing in small quantities. DOminating the aroma, though, is the hefty hop punch, very citrusey.  The taste is hard to describe. There's a definite malt character, but it's secondary to the HUGE hop flavor.  Mouthfeel is solid, with a malt backbone.  Drinkability is good, but I can only drink about two of the 22oz bottles of this before my tongue starts to feel funny from the hops. :-)  A serving note, if you want to really experience the flavor and aroma of this beer, serve room temp.

147,92,nlmartin,4.82,"This beer was served on tap at Eulogys in Philly. The beer was served in a pub glass.  Appearance: The beer has a dark amber nearing crimson coloration. The head was thin and off white. The beer left some streaks down the side of my glass.  Smell: The beer has a toasted maltyness. The maltyness helps bring in waves of aggressive grapefruit and pine cone resin. The beer has a good spicey alcohol aroma.  Taste: The beer produced great loads of citrus zest, grapefruityness, and pine trees. Tucked up underneath all this is a great big caramel malty backbone. The alcohol combines in the flavor to bring a spiceyness to the beer. This isnt as aggressive as I remember it; however, it is still a Arrogant Bastard.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. The beer has lingering hop oilyness. The beer is pleasingly complex. This beer was oddly very smooth on draft. This is a very drinkable bastard.

There is some light carbonation visible in the beer. Quite beautiful to look at.  Smell: This smells really good. It has a sweet aroma to it that is not at all overpowering. There is also the smell of malts in there. Very enticing smell, it really makes you want to drink deep. Probably one of the best smelling beers I've encountered.  Taste: Creamy, smooth, and full. This beer has a sweetness to it, but it is not wimpy. The flavor is quite rich, and is absolutely delightful. It masks the high ABV perfectly. It finishes with a bit of hoppy bitterness, which is a nice way to round out the beverage as a whole.  Mouthfeel: Heavy, and has a good sense of body to it. It is silky in its texture, and it slides over the tongue quite nicely. Quite a delight to swish around in the mouth.  Drinkability: Probably one of the best beers I've ever had. It is a true joy to drink this, and although it is sweet, I could drink these endlessly. You need to watch out though, as the bottle is 22oz and that ABV of 7.2% will creep up on you.

The aftertaste is bitter with some weird taste in it which I couldnt put my finger on. Doesnt have that beery taste to it (probably the style).  Mouthfeel/drinkability- Light Carbonation. Was very smooth and went down with ease. Could drink a few.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,mherring,4.03,"Pretty much the only reason I bought this was because of its name and the design that was on the bottle. I guess you could say I'm a sucker for their marketing scheme. The Arrogant Bastard poured out a brilliant dark shade of red, and I do mean dark. As far as color and appearance goes, this is one of the prettier beers I've ever seen. I could definitely smell the hops on this one, along with something else that could maybe be described as fruity, but the hops are prevalent for sure. The mouthfeel was a very pleasant sensation, very smooth, and the overall taste of the beer is like a swift kick to the taste buds. It comes on at first with a kind of sweet taste which is quickly followed up by all the hops that you got from the scent. On the whole this isn't a style of beer I'm particularly fond of, I can appreciate it for a beer or three, but not much more than that.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jokelahoma,4.77,"Can't believe I've been so remiss. I've not reviewed this one yet.  Pours a cloudy, deep reddish-orange, with a decent sized smooth and creamy head, which laces extremely well as you sip the beer. Beautiful color, and a lovely beer, minus the cloudiness.  The smell is surprisingly balanced, with a good amount of floral hoppiness followed immediately by a strong, sweet malty scent. A musty, almost dusty, earthy aroma announces the base malt presence. There's also a bit of fruitiness that sneaks in here, with hints of cherry and raspberry swirling around in my nose. All in all, this is more complex than one might expect.  The taste is initially very fruity, almost tropical punch-like, but it never sets in and grabs you, because it is followed immediately by a good firm bitterness, which in turn has a huge amount of hop flavor nipping at its heels. There's a ton of hop flavor to this... very flowery, not vegetal or even particularly citrusy. That flavor continues well after the initial bitterness fades, and yet that same bitter sensation returns almost as quickly as it left, to meld with the hop flavors, and the sneaky reappearance of the fruity malt, all combining to leave a remarkable and fantastically complex aftertaste. (I'll pause while English teachers stop foaming at the mounth over that last ""sentence""). The complexity of flavors makes it take longer to finish the beer. You simply cannot rush drinking this, as you're in no hurry to take another sip and interfere with that lovely taste combination. Make no mistake -- this *is* a bitter beer. But it's very easy to overlook that fact due to the beautiful way it all comes together. It's difficult, in my opinion, to imagine a better taste in this style of beer. This is absolutely as close to perfect as I can imagine a beer.  The brew has a fairly creamy and hefty mouthfeel to it. It isn't filling like many other beers with the same type mouthfeel, however. It's substantive enough to match the full flavor without detracting from the sensory experience. Nicely matched.  As the label humorously implies, this one ain't for everybody. It's big, it's bitter, it's bold, it's brash. But it's also so remarkably well made and well balanced that it's my opinion that anyone who considers themselves to be beer lovers must seek it out to try at least once. I don't believe I'd use this one as an intro to craft beers for a devout BMC drinker, but this is a great hook to sink into anyone already fishing craft waters. Simply put, it's beautiful. Great beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Golden2wenty1,4.27,"From notes, enjoyed a few bombers during Spring Break in Lake Havasu City, AZ.  Pour is a deep garnet/mahogany with a finger of khaki cream foam.  Nose starts with loads of sweet caramel malt, followed by fruity notes of raisin, mango, and papaya with a solid piney hop finish.  Taste reflects the nose, this time starting with piney bittering hops, then caramel malt, followed by the syrupy fruity notes and a steady alcohol presence.  Body is medium-full with crisp, hearty carbonation.  This is an intense, well-crafted, complex strong ale that deserves the credit it gets. A deal at $3.49/bomber in AZ as well. Also reminded me a lot of Bell's 3rd Coast Old Ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,roblowther,3.3,"Pours a lovely dark red color with minimal head that dissipates quickly and leaves a trace of tan lace. Smell is very floral, maybe roses and something sharp that hints at the bitterness to come. Taste is good, ALL hops. No malt within a mile of this one. The first taste is floral, maybe pine, then it rounds into a lovely, soft licorice-like roast that is not burnt at all. It sort of lulls you into complacency and then the bitterness comes on like a freight train, painting the back of the tongue with a burnt coffee sharpness. Not even something I can describe as aftertaste so much as a oral hangover. This is not my style (I suppose I live up to their ""you're not worthy"" motto) so I may be a bit jaded. Mouthfeel is very good, hits a good balance of roundness without being heavy. Drinkability - low. Low low low. I can't imagine making it through more than one in a session, just too much hops. All in all, probably a good example of a style that appeals to...someone other than me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,Elecid,4.37,"I was originally attracted to the beer by the packaging. Apparently, they hit my demographic well. I came for the packaging, but stayed for the singular flavor. I have yet to try double bastard, but I have high expectations.  A: I was half-expecting to see a mosquito fossilized within, ready to extract the dinosaur DNA. As everyone has said before, it's a dark amber. Quite stunning. The head is thick and worthy of the name. Sits there for a while, mocking you.  S: My favorite part of the beer. I was going to take my first swig, and then decided on a long sniff instead, it's *that* good. Strangely, i'd say I smelled guava & pine.  T: Hits you with sweet & then the bitter hops kick in. Like a one-two punch.  M: Nothing special, nothing to complain about. I wasn't forcing it down, but i wasn't pouring it down either. No chewiness.  D: The first time I had this beer, I thought it was overwhelming, and I had trouble finishing one 22-oz bottle. Coming back to it, after having tried some real beer, I find it an irresistable (if not perfect) brew, and it will be in my fridge quite frequently. Easier to drink than a stout, but not quite a session beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Thick light tan head that disapates very very slowly leaving lots of white lacing sticking to the glass.  S: Amazing smell. A perfect fix of sweet dark fruit, yet very bitter piney hops. Quite a sensory overload.  T: Like the smell it starts of very sweet, then quickly the bitterness takes over, leaving a very, very bitter aftertaste. The sweetness gets stronger as the drink warms and alcohol becomes more apparent, but the bitterness never goes away.  M: Thick with a perfect amount of carbonation, goes down very smooth for such a burly beer.  D: This is a very easy beer to drink for how big it is, though it's definatly not for everyone ""sophisticated"" or not.

147,92,Cresant,3.21,Pour from a 22 oz. bomber into a Stone IPA glass. Leather brown body and a tan three fingers head. Body looked like whisky--clear and refraction-y.  Sweet malt and alcohol aroma. ETOH candy.  Tasted of sweet dried fruit invaded by hop bitters. Licorice-like. Alcohol flavor increased as it warmed.  Medium bodied texture.  Complex yet not difficult to drink or enjoy.

147,92,objectivemonkey,4.87,"Holy mother of all things holy. This... wow. Pours a cloudy amber brown, a beautiful color, good sized creamy, thick, light tan head. Aroma is just fantastic. My friend said it best; ""I could simply smell this beer all night long."" As it came out of the bottle, could smell it and thought it'd be just potent, a little too much. Sat down and started with it, and it isn't actually that .... er, arrogant. Its actually just about right, between assertive and obscene. At once its heavily malty, a dark deep caramel malt thats more reminicent of barleywine malting, but perhaps thats me taking a whiff of the fantastic pine hop overtones that play center stage. If anything, this aroma is rich with subtleties that aren't subtle at all, complex, fantastic, and pretty much making my mouth drool.  Taste is what it should be, what it says it is; in your face, uncompromising, unyielding loads of hop, malt and just a little tug on the soul. It grabs you, invites you to chew on it, eat the malt, and oh ya, there are those boat loads of hops too. This is an all out war on the tongue, and mine has given up. Not as its too powerful, but its just perfect. That balance between the sizable hop load, bitter but not bittering, just a bite that lets you understand that its there, and its huge, but its not going to kick your ass, at least not yet. And the sweet caramel malt, practically making me smile, I lean my head back and say 'this is the best thing of my entire day.'  Most of this talk is rubbish. And I dont' care.

Pine, caramel, orange, and butter. I really have to strain to make out these scents. Taste is massive pine, burnt caramel, diacetyl, and pleasing bitterness. At the tail end I detect some pleasant grain. Mouth is perfectly modertate. I didn't care for this (I wasn't worthy?) the first several times I tried it. Something about the fruitiness didn't seem to mesh with the caramel. I had no such issues this time.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I had about an inch of head, and the glass remained lined with Belgian lace as I drank. The scents I detected were toffee, spicy floral, and oranges.  The taste was nice and bitter, with a complex hoppy bitterness. Somewhat similar to a weak imperial IPA. You can taste the alcohol, but it is not overpowering. A nice, full-bodied mouthfeel.  The beer is very enjoyable and drinkable, but it's heavy bitterness will probably prevent someone from drinking too many at once. A very noteable beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,krantul,4.43,"I give this beer a 5 for appearance. Sure, it's a gorgeous, deep dark beer with a menancing reddish glow to it, and it pours with a thick head worthy of Belgian beers, but it ascends to the next level with the best bottle design in the industry.  A strong malty scent is hightlighted with a floral hoppy zip; Stone is certainly one of the more masterful hoppers out there, and they really get the aroma into their beers.  To be fair, the bottle warned you. This is a rough-and-tumble, take-no-prisoners strong ale. The malt character is present but doesn't get in the way of some powerfully bitter hops that leap to the forefront of your palate. The faint alcohol burn is present, but contrubutes quite well to the character of this ale, like a good whiskey.  Drinkability? It seems wasteful to drink too much Arrogant Bastard. It's so powerfully distinct in its big, up-front flavors, that I appreciate it best in the context of other beers.

147,92,neenerzig,4.3,"This beer pours a medium to dark amber brown color with a nice tan head that doesnt stay very large for very long but lingers for quite a bit and leaves some very generous lacing in my glass. Smells are dominated by a sort of roasted musty aroma and of course hops with a hint of some dark fruits accompanied by malts. This beer is very big on the hops indeed. Lots of hops going here, yet it also tastes a bit sweet at the same time. The taste also reminds me of roasted black coffee with some malts, a touch of fruityness, and perhaps dark chocolate as well. There is of course some hop bitterness in the taste, quite a bit of it in fact, but it is not overly bitter either. This beer has a nice frothy, smooth, and crisp, and perhaps even creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Not the most drinkable beer I have ever had due to the hop bitterness going on, but I find it to be pretty drinkable overall. To me it is not quite as good as Stone's IPA or RIS, but nevertheless Stone does it again! This beer is a winner for sure!  Eric",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Malt is light-colored caramels and a bit of smoke (which may actually be a a result of hop grassy character). Thick body and moderate carbonation. Not the 'arrogant bastard' that I was expecting.

147,92,Domingo,3.93,"Well, I've been drinking bombers of this for years, but after drinking quite a bit of this on tap in San Diego, I figure it's time to review it! Comes out a bright amber color. Looks a little like a really dark amber ale. Foamy Head is present and it sticks around for the duration of the beer. Smell is of hops, alcohol, brandied fruit, and a little yeast. I think it has a little stronger smell out of a bottle, but on tap it's still quite nice. Flavors are very bold. Reminds me a little of a hopped brandy, but obviously far more drinkable. There's a little bit if citrus and pineapple in there, likely because of the variety of hops Stone's IPA also has this. It came out relatively cold, but as it warms, more sweet flavors start to come out. Mouthfeel is what it should be for a beer like this. Thick enough to retain the flavor in your mouth, but not syrupy or watered down. Drinkability is one of those things that could vary a lot. I tried this on a really warm day and it's definitely a sipper. Treat this like a belgian ale in terms of power in spite of the alcohol being much better hidden. It's got a spot as Stone's signature beer, but I personally like the IPA and RIS better. With that said, it's still a wonderful beer and one of those beers I'm always recommending for people looking to try a good beer to see what all the talk is about.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

A Deep, clear reddish amber color, with some reddish hues in the light. Thin cream colored head.* the foam is rather dense and very well retained. Holdin' on strong  Smells of poultry(due to the grain?) Big bitter hop, smokey and nutty.* Fresh dark wheat bread and caramel. Malty sweet with Dark maple syrup. Big maple syrup wih a smokey, wood fire thing.  Hops are pretty powerful here, plenty bitter. starts off with a nutty malt taste finishing bitter.  Excellent rich deep and active on the palate, very potent hop bitterness.  Very drinkable.  * So after reading my original review. I decided this Craft beer pioneer deserved a more detailed account. I just grabbed a 16 oz ""tallboy""from my local neighborhood market. So here goes the updated review: 5/30/17  A deep and lurid amber color with red and brown hues reveals itself to be very healthy in stature. A muscular, off-white sea foam tower stays high for a very long time. Bubbly and thick, the foam is impressive with long retention and plenty of lace to follow. Big, sticky lace fir sure!  A very heady, thick and sweet malty dominant aroma impresses the olfactory system. Herbal and earthy hop tones ride over a rich, brown sugar and dark wheat malt smell. Very earthyhop notes with dark amber malt combo remains in a very fine balance.  The multitude of hop flavor remains very impressive 10 + years after my first review. Very earthy, dry leafy bitter notes, resinous and pine aspects pop out, high alpha classic, minus the fruity and or citrus dominant brews dominating the current craft market. The malt also plays an equally as impressive part of the flavor spectrum. A crispy, dry and very full mouthfeel becomes evident with the amber, chared-brown sugar malt complexity. A very tasty, English-style ale flavored malt couples and mingles with the high alpha, yet earthy explosion of hops in epic fashion. My lips are sticky from the big sugar effect of big, dark malty side of this brew. Balance is righteous, Big malt and Big hops makes this a very exceptional All-American big ale.  ""This is an aggressive beer"".....fair warning! And I distinctly remember when we first got Stone here in NH. It was bustin' up taste buds, kicking ass and taking names. I still feel the impact all these years later. Holds up to some of the most heady and complex brews of 2017.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

To me it's more of a bittering hop taste and less of a refreshing citrus hop taste you find in an IPA. Much like the smell there is a small hint of malt at the end. I enjoy that the hop flavor lingers in your mouth quite a bit afterwards. Mouthfeel is unexpected. I thought it would be lighter in gravity but to my surprise it was thicker than expected. As for drinkability, I enjoy Stone's other brews more but this isn't bad. I had one a few years ago and despised it but it was quite enjoyable this time around. I think Stone got it right that this isn't for the naive palate, if you do not like it, try something less hoppy and work your way up to it.

Aroma was primarily cascade hops, and lots of them. Some sweet malt was there to provide balance. Almost wanted to say I smelled chocolate malt (!) but more likely it was Special-B. Body was medium-to-full with lots of bitterness and hop flavor. Some malt, in fact probably quite a bit, but the balance was still way to the hop side. Mouthfeel was pretty standard, though if you didn't know the alcohol content you'd probably underestimate it. Drinkability was about average; if you like hops, and I mean really like hops, you'd score it higher.  Interesting beer. One of those ""extreme beers"" that many go for. I tend to prefer mine a bit more balanced. If you threw in some more malt and maybe used a less attenuative yeast, you'd have yourself a pretty nice barleywine.

Sticky lacing lines the glass.  Smell: Big, grapefruity hops waft out of the glass, followed by a dark, fruity sweetness. Hints of dark brown sugar are also present along with a pine cone like aroma.  Taste: A big, piney hoppiness dominates the beginning, a very satisfying bitterness that all hop heads will enjoy, the middle shows a feighnt molasses like sweetness that is quickly pushed out of the way by the big hoppy finish. Big, piney hops rear there head again leaving the mouth dry and begging for another sip. The hoppy bitterness lingers long on the tongue. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Medium, very smooth and somewhat creamy. Carbonation is right on the money.  Drinkability: Arrogant Bastard definitely lives up to its hype. I've had this numerous times and everytime I have one, I forget how good it is. Those big, piney, citrusy like hops do it for me, a fantastic bitterness that only makes you want to drink more. Alcohol is very well hidden, and the brown sugar sweet malt gives AB a very nice balance. Highly drinkable for a 7.2% abv. one that I will always come back to.

Arrogant Bastard pours a clear mahogany colour, and had a one finger thick tan head. The head was creamy and lasted a long time.  The smell is dominated by the hops. Citrus, lemon-lime like bitter hops, with a raisin like malt base. My wife says she finds cherry in it, and digging in I could see where she is coming from. Lots of smell, in ways it reminds me of a barley wine.  The taste is quite impressive, nothing in it is watery in the least. The is a dark malty flavour that does its best to balance out a long lingering citrus hop bite. Alcohol is apparent in the finish, and provides a somewhat earthy heat.  The beer is somewhat oily in its body, and has a medium amount of carbonation. Altogether the beer is comfortable on the tongue and pleasant to swallow.  This one is too damn drinkable, I found myself longing for another. Even with the extra alcohol, Arrogant Bastard is dangerously easy to down.

I've looked all around and a 22oz bomber is usually $3.99 to $5.29. This is just a great beer for a VERY good price. Even at the high $5.29.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ultralarry2006,4.45,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber. Tan one finger head with good retention and nice lacing. Body is a deep reddish brown.  Smell - kilned bready malts and some piney hops. Some toasty malt and caramel, slight citrus, some woodsyness, grassy, and herbal tones, too.  Taste - much like the smell, but also more going on as well. Bready, toasty, even roasty, malts - pine, lemon hops. Amongst all that are hints of vanilla and bourbon. Slight alcohol astringency at the end, with a bready malt, and slight bourbon aftertaste, also a little bit of lemony tea.  Mouthfeel - full, smooth, low carbonation. Thick hop oil slickness. Slight dryness.  Drinkabilty - very good beer, goes down easy. Would have several of these anytime.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Orrshow,4.23,"Appearance  This beer pours a very deep red reminding me of nicely stained and varnished wood. There is a centimeter of off white head and it retains nicely. As the beer goes down it leaves bits of lacing on the glass.  Smell  Up front there is huge aromas of bitter citrus hops. I can smell caramel malts, roasted toffee, and alcohol. There are tiny bits of cherry in there too. A very nice effect.  Taste  This beer tastes wonderful. There is a complex mix of toasted grains, sweet caramel, and toffee. On top of that a slight taste of peat arises and is complimented by a pleasurable toned down alcohol burn. The finish is of crisp citrus hops which bring about a very bitter flavor. In some ways it reminds me of a Barley Wineespecially when it warms.  Mouthfeel  A little prickly from the carbonation but nothing too bad. The body is nice and heavy the way I like it. Finishes somewhat dry.  Drinkability  Very good...as long as you can handle a full bodied and hard hitting beer. For me thats no problem.  As the bottle states in so many wordsthis beer is not for the weak. I love huge beers such as this and am very glad I had the opportunity to taste this one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I've been drinking and pushing this beer since early 1999 at the latest. With that said, heres the half basd review.  Appearance: Dark Reddish/Brown  Nose: Caramel, Strong hops with light spice, vanilla pudding  Body: Medium full to full  Flavor: Sweet and bitter, a symphonic battle of hops and malt. Bitter but balanced  Some who are not impressed by this beer forget (or never knew) how important this beer was in convincing other brewers that there was a market for bigger beers. Sure, there are big beers from all over now. But this will always have a place in my heart and my fridge.

147,92,jerrymiller,3.85,"Appearance is dark reddish brown with a nice fluffy tan head that leaves monster amounts of lace behind as it slowly recedes.  Smell has hints of citrus, malt and pine. It is a complex beer.  Taste has some cherry, malt, floral hops. The alcohol doesn't overwhelm, so I guess you chalk it up to being well balanced.  Mouthfeel is smooth bodied with healthy carbonation and a dry finish.  Drinkability is good, although complex.  I don't know that ABA could possibly live up to the marketing espoused on the bottle, ie: ""you're not worthy."" I enjoy the beers Stone brewseven if their advertising smacks of elitism.

147,92,DaPeculierDane,4.5,On tap at Jupiter in Berkeley.  Pours a dark crimson into one of Jupiters hoity-toity pint glasses. Medium thickness whitish head that quickly dissipates. Heavily loaded caramel base with powerful grapefruit and juniper aromas. Blistering hoppiness that manages to not overwhelm the strong caramel body. Some nice toast and roasted character. Wonderfully balanced. Quite impressive really. This beer has a reason to be arrogant. Body is firm. Finish is mouth coating maintaining its outstanding balance. Surprisingly drinkable.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I detect some citrus aroma also, grapefruit maybe. It also has a slight malty sweet caramel aroma. This beer smells very well balanced.  This beer has a grassy hop flavor. It tastes of grapefruit also. Cascades? They wont tell. It tastes sweet. The balance between malt and hops is very good. The hop flavor might be just a little overbearing though.  This beer is full bodied. It leaves a piney aftertaste. It is carbonated well.  I dont know how good os a session beer this one is. The hoppy flavor, although good, is a little overbearing, making it hard to enjoy too many. Also, the alcohol content is just a little high.

147,92,JohnnyM2002,3.93,Beer poors a dark amber-ish color and a nice head...a good word for the color would be carmelized. Scent reminded me of a hazlenut-caramel-malt.

147,92,barknee,4.6,"Arrogant Bastard pours a deep burnt caramel color with an impressive chunky-foamy tan colored head. Aromas of fruitcake, pine, juniper, lime zest and candied fruits soar from thy glass. The taste is rich and flavorful, having a warm roasted malt and bitter hop lip-smacking interaction that is truly outstanding. Dangerously easy to quaff, the embedded natural carbonation creates the perfect atmosphere for this turbo-enhanced brew, as this active and dense carbonation carries itself onboard in a perfect way. I have tried a few of Stones products and Ive always felt that they lacked an element of profound complexity. This ale stands out as my favorite to date, having many more layers of complexity, much better in proportion, balance and just a better synthesis of its total parts creating one. This is a fantastic presentation of the style, perhaps the icon.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,normZurawski,3.55,"This undoubtedly fits into the category of an American Strong Ale, emphasis on the strong part. To be sure, this keeps in line with Stone's tendancy to brew a beer that is more in your face than it is necessarily drinkable. Some people like that, and that's fine. But when it comes to pouring a nice glass of beer on a cool spring evening on a Friday night, this beer kicks you in the flavor nuts with steel tipped boots. This ale takes out a razor blade, scrapes off the top layer of your tongue, and drags its flavor across your taste buds.  I find it an interesting beer. But really, for the hype it's just not all its cracked up to be. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy it. But not enough to do backflips as a lot of people do for this beer. So what is this beer like, anyway?  It's a good looking beer, nice and dark, rich and deep red color in the glass. Aroma is also good, portending a solid beer. Taste is good but over the top, strong in the hops, moderate in the malt, and way too bitter. Mouthfeel is clouded by the bitterness. Due to its extreme nature, this is an average drinkability at best.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,SethB2,4.26,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Looks great, deep ruby color and a massive head that leaves the glass looking almost destroyed. Perfection. Smells of sweet malts up first, but with a very pronounced grapefruit hoppiness. Very inviting and unique smell. Taste is great. The first thing I notice is a maltiness but it isn't what I would categorize as sweet. Probably because the hops come over the top and beat them back down. It's a war really. Both are there in large quantities. Mouthfeel is full and slick. Drinkabilty is also pretty darn good.  In related news, I love Stone Brewing.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Sosh,4.13,"My first Arrogant Bastard. I'm typing my thoughts as I drink this. I feel it's appropriate.  I didn't think where I lived I would find this, but I did. I've seen this beer hyped up on this site, but based on the style I never made an attempt to really search this beer out. However....there it was, sitting along 4 others of it's kind in the glass cooler. I had to check it out.  At first I was a little dissapointed when I poured it into my glass. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but seeing how arrogant the bottle was, I was hoping for something unique. Then I noticed that the head wasn't going anywhere...and the lacing is covering all sides of the glass upon drinking. Very impressive. When I hold this near light, a demon-red color emerges. Maybe I think demon because of what's on the bottle....or maybe because it just fucking is.  The smell wasn't frightening at all....rather it was enticing. I've struggled to find a beer with a 'good' smell, and I think now I realize that I need to think more on the lines of ""does the smell get me excited about taking a drink."" This ale did that.  Taste---I can detect the hint of alcohol, but for the most part it is masked. I guess this is my first ""Strong Ale,"" and I would choose this over many many other beers I have. Gotta give it points for that.  I think everyone should try this once.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

A nice ring of lacing slowly drifted down the glass each time.  Grassy hops aroma, with hints of grapefruit and pine and alcohol.  Taste was very hoppy with a stiff malt backbone and quite a lot of grass flavor and grapefruit as well. Very bitter. It reminded me of Dogfishhead 90 IPA. I was excited to try this beer, but was dissappointed in how hopped up it was. I'm not a fan of highly hopped beer, so I didn't care for this that much. It was obviously a quality beer, but not my style. To quote from the label, apparently I'm not worthy to drink it!!  Nice mouthfeel. Warming from the alcohol, which wasn't hidden that well.

The smell was elusive as I noticed a few different things but couldn't place anything precisely (i think my nose is going bad on me). The taste revealed a strong toasted malt flavor to the point where I second guessed that I was drinking a stout. But then the hops smacked me awake. Fruitiness.

Arrogant Bastard has not been one of my favorite of the Stone lineup, but it is very good to say the least. I am drinking this from a 22oz bomber in a pint glass. It pours a deep mohagany with a nice tan head that last for a litte while. AB has a very nice aroma with hints of roasted malt and and grapefruit hoppiness. The flavor is aggressive with a good bit of hops upfront and nice malt middle with a slight hint of Belgian candied sugar. It has quite a bit of bittering hops in the end and aftertaste. The aftertaste is a little harsh due to the bitterness and a small amount of alcohol warming which effects the drinkability. AB has a nice medium body and is a very drinkable beer if you are into aggressive beers.

147,92,petemorris,4.04,"I only recently returned to serious homebrewing and beer enthusiasm after close to a decade of basically settling for what I could get at the local Trader Joe's. While plenty familiar with the old-school, west-coast originals, I was thus way behind the times when it comes to the great second-generation (1990s) craft brewers, not the least of which is Stone. The whole gargoyle motif and ""arrogant bastard"" 'tude never really did it for me, but I'd read so many good things--and more than that, I'm a proud SoCal guy who'll firmly believes in thinking globally but drinking locally--that I finally had to get with the times and try this stuff.  Bottom line: good but not great. I'm just an old-school guy, and the over-the-top, IBU-flooded bitterness is just not for me. I love the fact that a Stone exists and that they're willing to push the envelope, but for me, the defining factor of a great beer is balance and harmony. While Arrogant Bastard offers that in its wonderfully inviting, strong but not overpowering, aroma--sweet and citrusy, that I pegged as grapefruit at first but then became more mango-like, with a very pleasant floral hop background--the flavor is just too bitter. As the beer warms, the complexity begins to come out in the background, but it's still dominated by the raw, even harsh, bitterness of the excessive hops--kind of like a good piece of music being overpowered by the bass being turned up way too high. If only the bittering hops were turned down, allowing some of the sweetness of the malt to come through, this would truly be a great beer. Or maybe it really is a great beer, and I'm just ""not worthy"".",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I find the aroma has more of a sweet malt character with citrus and floral hops coming in at the end. The taste is excellent! Spicy, fruity, a bit sweet in the beginning with a touch of smokiness to it. Bitterness from the hops come in upon swallowing with a smooth, slick, slightly thick mouthfeel.

147,92,trep,4.9,"Mother of God, thanks to Stone for making this delicious beer.  Pours from the 22 dark red, like beet juice. Nice blonde colored head foams up and as it settles leaves a nice bit of lacing around the top of the goblet. Dark brown and clear, with the tan head sitting atop it, it looks like some yum.  Smells of grapefruit, flowers, piney and citrus hops dominate the aroma. Alcohol in the nose, doesn't take away from the beer in the least bit. Cereal malts in the background, but very faint. Smells wonderful I really can't say enough about the grapefruit smelling hop character. Juicy is really the only word that does it justice.  Refreshing hop bite initially that lasts forever and a day. A schpeil of flavors present themselves through out the bitterness. Pine, sweet fruits, and citrusy hops are very prevalent. Sweet malts give the hops a nice backbone to hold it up. To me, the feel of this Bastard on my pallate is perfect. Not syrupy, but not thin either. A bit chewy, but you won't need your spoon to drink this. About as close as you can get to perfection.  This beer would have been all 5's if it would have been a bit easier to drink. The hop bitterness really lasts throughout and destroys your pallate. But it is worth it. Without question one of my top 5 of all time.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,RDAdams,4.32,"Appearance: The most difficult part of this review was trying to define the color of the ale. Without my 64 color crayola set, it's difficult. It's a light opaque amber brown and clear when you hold it up to the light. The head is full, beautiful, and well-retained.  Smell: The aroma jumps out at you with all its complexities. You inhale the full spectrum of the malts and the hops. My wife is my arbiter of beer. She does not care for beer that much. She took eook a whiff of the aroma of this beer and said ""Now that's a beer.""  Taste: It isn't enough that it tastes great. It coats your entire mouth and into your throat with enough that the taste lingers on for minutes. And the taste is so exceptional that you wind up sipping the beer so that you don't waste a drop of the taste.  Mouthfeel: Women claim that I chew my beer, I say I move it around in my mouth and savor it until the chill is gone before swallowing. If we eliminate the taste from mouthfeel, the beer is somewhat thin for a beer with such a powerful taste.  Drinkability: This beer is clearly not for everyone. It is not a beer you would give to a man or a woman dying of thirst or an aficionado of American swill. To me it is awesome; to others I don't know.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Budlum,4.16,"Pours with a slightly cloudy, ruby color from a well described bottle. The bottle alone is a keeper for sure. The scents are certainly lacking. It smells like beer, I think. The first sip makes you forget trying to gain knowledge by scent. Immediately malty without becoming over-bearing. Slight hop finish with some wonderful dried fig notes. Certainly a slow drink to be enjoyed on a relaxing evening. Apparently the alcohol content is moderately high but, its presence cannot be detected in the taste.  Served from a 22 oz. bomber, the second pour in to a goblet reveals a thick, deeply-colored, lasting head similar to Brasserie des Rocs Grand Cru. The hoppy finish and slight alcohol taste was also more apparent on the second serving.

147,92,Metalmonk,4.52,"Pours a nearly opaque ruby color, with a thick tan head that's foamy and fizzy and retains extremely well, flattening only very very slowly. Plenty of bubbles working their way to the top. I look at the body and think ""barleywine""...I look at the head and think ""porter""...I look at the bubbles and think ""tripel""...I wonder what this is going to taste like...  Sweet candy-like smell reminds of cherry twizzlers and caramel milkshakes. Later I get a blueberry maple syrup thing. Wow, what an aroma.  All kinds of sweet flavors come to mind once this hits the lips, but the sweetness is not at all hard to take or overbearing. Just well-balanced. I think of all the aromas listed above when sipping this fine ale. The boastful text on the bottle would make this seem like a spikey, extreme and/or high-alcohol beer, but it's none of the above. Just a complex ale with a malty profile that offers a wide variety of candy/fruit type combinations, with hop bitterness and a wheaty heft giving it more depth. I don't taste or smell the insane hops that a lot of other people sense in this beer, but that's the beauty of the Arrogant Bastard: terribly hard to pin down.  Mouthfeel is incredibly creamy, considering the bubbles I saw in the beginning. I wouldn't drink this every day, it's so unique that it strikes me as a special-occasion type thing. But wow, it's delicious. Somewhere between a malt liquor, a double IPA, an old ale and a barleywine...this is another fantastic beer from the creative freaks at Stone. Long may they brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BRoss242,4.53,"A- Pours a crystal clear ruby red color with a tight 3 finger head that lasts forever. Leave a thick lacy film from start to finish.  S- Nice malt aroma with a good amount of hops gives it a fruity floral sent.  T- Nice balance of malt and hops with a hint of caramel, plums and some pepper rolling across my tongue. As this warms it gives me the impression that they have some smoked malts in here.  M-Very heavy full bodied, warming beer almost like an Elglish Old Ale but with alot of hops added, creamy and bitter feel mixed together when its going across my tongue.  D- I wish I get this more often, but Stone hasn't arrived in Florida yet. If I can get a regular supplier of this I will buy more than 2 bottles nest time. Overall a very good beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,cproioi,3.83,"This is the first time ever having this beer and I'm reviewing it as I'm drinking it. I have high expectations of this beer I hope it doesn't let me down.  Poured from a 22oz brown bottle into a nonic pint glass  A:pours a lovely dark red with a two finger tan head that is staying up for a good amount of time andleaves very good lacing.  S: first thing that hits me is the hops however it's not a strong hops smell like an IPA but it's certainly noticable. A pine cone and spice aroma accompany this beer as it warms. Also more of an alcohol smell comes to my nose.  T: 1st sip a well balanced hop and malt blend. With a lightly hoppy after taste. few minutes later I taste more malt in this taste then I did in the first, very interesting. Leaves a maltier after taste. Now it's a balance betweem hops and malt very good. A little later I'm getting a peppery after taste. More time passed and the peppery hops flavor is coming more and more to the front of the taste.  M: Thick feel almost syrupy. leaves the mouth with a nice warming feeling. The feeling falls down the throat. Very nice.  D: I would like to have another one. I can't really tell that the abv is 7.2% so drinking one after another would be easily done. However, I predict that would have a bad result. Cannot drink as quick as I'd like seeing that I have to go to work in a bit. I can't bring myself to pour this down my throat every sip makes me want to hold it in my mouth and dissect every taste.  Final verdict: I liked this beer it was very good. I will soon be getting another bottle of this and suggesting it to my friends.  Side note: This ale's name and bottle humor me the same way Kanye West humors me. They are both just so full of themselves and I find both to be very funny.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,DaggerEyes,4.33,"22 oz bomber bottle----&gt;my trusty pint glass  Poured a lovely brown / ruby red color with a thick creamy head, a tannish color. Very vicous and sticky as hell, lacing forms all over the walls of the glass  Some buttery notes on the nose mingle with some nutty toffee scents and the faintest bit of alchohol in the background. Also detect some carmel, chocolate scents and malty sweetness  A BOLD brew that truly lives up to it's name...So many complexities exist in the smell, test and mouth feel of this brew. Carbonation lights up the tip of the tounge, the settles down leaving this medium bodied all to move smoothly over the rest of your tounge.  Very creamy... yet On the front of the tounge a bit sweet with some carmel / milk chocolate profiles, these are proceeded by the complex hop profile that are bold as all hell. The finish is relatively smooth with some sweet notes popping up once again and a somewhat dry finish. After the finish there is even a sort of Rasberry tart/sweet taste going on.  This is the type of beer that is so deep it is hard to actually pin point the individual tastes (in a good way) you almost taste something new with each and every sip.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,cubedbee,4.5,"This was my first craft beer ever back in college, and as the label says, I didn't like it, at all, because I lacked the taste and sophistication to enjoy good beer. How things have changed--now I can see that this is a superb beer, a wonderful brewing creation, far superior to anything I enjoyed in my unlightened days.  Onto the review--I served this from a 22 oz bomber into a snifter, it poured a dark deep amber, garnet on the edges, a finger of dense beige head that sticks around for a few minutes before subsiding to a scattered cap. Some decent bits of lacing left behind on the glass. Nose has a nice dose of citric hops as expected, but there is also a strong malt with hints of caramel, dark fruits and brown sugar. Taste meets expectations, starting with a nice full caramel malt, some toasted and nutty flavors detectable, and then giving way to a nice long bitter citrusy lemony hop finish Very nice, certainly hop heavy, but this beer has the malt backbone to keep up. Full bodied with a very nice smooth mouthfeel. This is an incredible beer, a huge American beer that is nonetheless tasty and drinkable if you've acclimated yourself to hops, I wish I didn't have to travel across state lines to get Stone beers.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,CAMRAhardliner,4.53,"Another incredible beer by Stone. This brewery is amazing, the hype is justified IMO.  Pours a captivating firey amber. The eggshell colored head is densely packed and never dissappears. It leaves big chunks of foam on the glass, not just lace. The aroma is citrusy and bitter with a doughy, caramel malt balast.  The taste is packed with malt and hop flavors. Pungent pine and grapefruit immediately assault my palate. Almost simultaneously grainy, mollases and raisin bread dough notes appear. The middle is like being caught in the crossfire of a Hops and Malts gun battle. There are all kinds of flavors flying every which way. In the finish, the Hops gain the upper had. Theres a resinous bitterness that comandeers the finish and makes the aftertaste long and delicious. The mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation.  I love this beer. It is the most flawlessly balanced beer Ive tried. Some might say its a little hop forward, maybe thats what makes it balanced to a hophead like me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,goochpunch,4.16,"(4-2-07) I've finally come around to this, and, as such, I'm updating the review.  Pours out an off-red leathery brown color with few bubbles to be found in the body. Head is kind of small, beige, and leaves rings of lace on the glass. Malt aromas have a little bit of chocolate and toasted grain while the hops lean towards resin. Alcohol is a little to prominent in the nose for me. Flavor is of the toasty malts, lots of fruity esters (reminding me of the their porter), and a big finish of hops: grassy, floral, and earthy, with a pronounced aspirin bitterness that lingers on for a while. Mouthfeel is smooth on carbonation, it is almost to the point of being thick, but doesn't carry too much weight in the mouth. Solid overall drinkability.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,mithrascruor,4.08,"22 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  I reviewed this beer four years ago, and at the time gave it a 'C'. Really, it was my first introduction to 'extreme' beers. Shortly thereafter, I came to really enjoy Arrogant Bastard (and other Stone offerings), but never bothered to change my review here...  Appearance: Pours a hazy dark reddish-color with a tint of copper at the edges. Some bubbles visible rising to the surface. Great off-white/tan head; dense and leaves great lacing.  Smell: Big somewhat spicy aroma of citrus and malts.  Taste: This is quite a spicy beer with grapefruit, citrus, and hop spicyness, all over caramel-like malts that try to balance out the flavor. Has a good kick in the bitterness department at the finish.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and medium- to heavy-bodied. Has some very soft yet tingly carbonation.  Drinkability: Good ABV for this type of beer. Strong taste, but if you like it, is is really enjoyable.  A really great and special beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ColoradoBobs,2.85,"On tap at Old Chicago, downtown Denver, CO.  Served too cold in a chilled mug. Poured with no head: just an off-white ring that left good lacing. Cloudy plain brown. Smell is malty front, with hop side notes. Taste is the opposite: very hoppy foreground (pine, metallic, bitter) with just a hint of malt background. The bartender sold me this by saying it was balanced and complex. Those who know me also know I'm a malt-lover, and so take it with a grain of salt when I say that I didn't find it either balanced or complex. Overtly hoppy and bitter (too much so for my taste!), with hardly any malt presence. Even after I let it sit and warm up, it was still too one-dimensionally hop-dominated. Decent mouthfeel (its best feature), and fairly drinkable. I've had one, now. Probably not again, and certainly not for $4.75 (plus tip) for a pint.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,budsboy,4.37,"Another of my favorite Stone brews. I usually keep one to three of these in my cellar.  Pours clear and a deep, rich blood soaked amber. A fat, rocky tan head sits on top.  Very aromatic. You can smell this a six paces. Smell is rich carmel malts, dark fruit, alcohol and a dominating piney-citrus hop.  Ka-pow. Taste is a powerful combination of sweet malt, bitter hops and warming alcohol. The carmel malt fades to a roasted flavor. Meanwhile, citrusy hops pound the palate.  The scent of this one is enough to love, and the flavor leaves me wanting more.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,NiceGuyMike,4.23,"Second review almost a year later and a lot more beer experience.  Appearence not what I remember (or wrote). It is very dark, but only a light tan head. Aside from that it is still awesome looking.  First scent hit me with sweet malts almost caremel malts. Very nice. Then I was hit with the floral hops, very hoppy, but lingering malts were present as well. Very interesting.  Initial taste include nice hoppy malts. Very mellow. Then, bam, smacked in the face with bitterness. That was quickly follow by more bitterness. Yikes, this thing doesn't let up. After a while you forget the bitterness and it seems to tone down, but my tonge did become numb.  This is mealy; but in a good way. Very thick and lushous.  High alchole makes this not the most drinkable, but it is much more enjoyable than I remember.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Phatz,4.48,"The bottle said enjoy by 1/06 this is 3/06 so it is not even worth mentioning its age. However I was told over and over again about how tremendously hoppy and extreme this beer is. I did not have that experience. My guess is that this years batch may be more mellow than last years. I am not into overly extreme beers! This was a fantastically perfect blended beer with a very nicely defined hop character but there was nothing cloying about it. It was balanced with a very pleasant sweet toasted malt smell and taste. Most of all this beer is so easy to drink I wish I had cases of it. In fact, my friends B-Day is coming up and I might just see if I can get a keg (or a case of bombers). EXCEPTIONAL!  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Birdiebeagle,4.18,Bottle Pours clear brown with a small creamy light brown head. The head lasts well and produces great lacing. Aroma has a strong maltiness. I get some chocolate with some cookie. The carbination is perfect. Has a full body with a good palate and a slick texture. A good duration and a wonderful finish. A very good aftertaste. This is very good. The bottle has all kinds of insults on it. Its rather amusing.

I know the bottle doesn't make the beer but it's nice to have something to read as I am sipping.  Appearance: Dark ruby some what brownish in color. Pours a nice frothy head that retained long enough for me to allow the beer to slightly warm up. Nice lacing.  Smell: Tons of hop aroma. Some grains and some alcohol.  Taste: The hops are obvious and expected when drinking most Stone brews, gotta love that. The malts help to tame the hops with a distinct caramel and chocolate taste. The taste is complex and always interesting, especially once this big beer warms up a bit.  Mouthfeel: Medium body that is very smooth.  Drinkability: A wonderfully drinkable beer. The ABV is somewhat high but not near high enough to have to stop after one bomber. If I get my hands on a case I would not stop at one.  Overall another great beer from Stone. I can't think of another beer that I could really compare this to but why try anyways, this one is simply great.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

First I love the orange head, this is the only beer I've had with a non-whitish head. It has a nice dark color, with a slight amber tint when you hold it up to the light.  This beer's aroma is great, a very warm smell... almost a little nutty.  The taste is strong at first, but after a few sips, I find it to be very smooth and refreshing. I prefer this beer in the wintere over the summer.  After a bomber of this I felt great, the effects of this beer seem to stick with a little longer than most.

Taste is aggressive hops and robust caramel roasted malt. This is a huge flavor - but amazingly balanced. Wonderfully complex. Finish is crisp. Dark fruit sweetness and bittter hops lingers on the pallet.  Mouthfeel is full bodied without being oily.  This is a great beer. What more needs to be said?

Dark Brown/Mahogany color, off-white head and lacing. 1"" head on moderate pour, lots of lacing.  Smells like the entrance to the garden of eden: citrus, cherries, malt.  Taste is hoppy (like a Christmas tree) with bittersweet chocolate finish.  Not super oily, but leaves a smooth hop bitterness. As stated with smell, very well balanced with subtle malt taste. Could be...perfect?  Drinkability: Could drink 4-5 bombers, but at 7.2% that would end my night too early.

This one doesn't let on to the big hop flavor on first sniff. The taste: more of a sensation of mouth-filling bitterness at first. Halfway through the glass and it's sharply bitter, moderately malty, and slightly sweet/caramel-like. Moderate body and only slightly carbonated in the mouth. Finishes a sticky and bitter.  Overall, a wonderful beer.

This old ale pours a deep mahogany rich color with a creamy almond head of distinction. Great lacing of coarse.  Strong hops up front, floral and spicy, with deep earthy malt tones in the background, this is a full bodied brew with flavor aplenty. The tasty-taste as always, fills and satisfies your tastebuds into beer oblivian, then leaves with a nice bitter hop finish...very satisfying and fairly strong and warming.  A very complex and tasty ale, definitely not for ""tasteless fizzy yellow beer"" drinkers, and is always one of my favorites...i'll drink to that !!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Nice hops in it, to me it's floral and citrisy at the same time. little bits of caramel to it as well as sweet chocolates.  Taste. Hops galore, well not the hoppiest of beers ever, but it is up there. Earthy flavor. Slighly floral hops, but i think im getting a lot more esters. Malts give this a great backbone. again, earthy, and i also get a grassy flavor. Aftertaste is alcoholic and on the dry side.  Mouthfeel is good. Full body, great balance. Good carbonation.  Overall i hate the fact so many people can go and pick this up at their local store, and it's taken me 2 years to get my hands on a bottle.

Gorgeous lacing  Smells of cherry, citrus, roasted malt and a lotta hops come through after you get through the malt aromas.  The flavor is a great balance of a lot of sweet malt and the hops. The sweetness hits you first with a sweet fruity cherry/citrus malt flavor on the tip of your tongue before the piney hops come in and stick to your tongue until the next sip. The hops are super strong in the aftertaste.  This is medium- to full-bodied. Thick and creamy, it coats the inside of the mouth (and leaves my lips sticky from all the malt).

On the back had the defination of the word arrogance, info about the beer, and info about the brewery. There is not just a sentence of info, the entire back of the bottle is filled with info. If you have time to kill, then you can read the back of the bottle. One of the better looking bottles.  Appearance: When poured into my Samuel Smith pint glass, it was this deep dark brown color with a 1 finger head of white foam. That left a moderate amout of lace, but plenty of rings around the glass.  Smell: When I popped the cap this big aroma of bitter hops came gushing out. When I poured it, the hops were still there along with a massive helping of citrus friuts. I should also mention that when I swirled it around, the citrus fruits had turned into a pleasant juicy fruit aroma. Excellent aroma!  Taste: Up front there were plenty of different kinds of citrus fruits, with the grapefruit being the most predominate. Behind that was of course the usual Strong Ale taste of strong bitter hops. After that I also detected a slight sweetness to it. Bascially this beer offers to what you would expect from a Strong Ale. Very good!  Mouthfeel: What I didn't care about this beer was that in the back of my throat was this strong bitter hops taste that doesn't seem to want to go. You have to drink a glass water to get this strong bitter taste out of your mouth. Besides that it was medium bodied and couldn't detect that 7.2% ABV.  Drinkability: When I first had this pre-BA I couldn't even drink this, it was too strong for me at that time and now I can drink this once in a while if I wanted to.

Taste is a great mix of thick sweet toffee malts with a strong piney hop finish.

147,92,Oxymoron,4.49,"The story on the side of the bottle is ever so clever.  Poured out a cloudy amber color with mahogany highlights when held to the light. A ample head with very small bubbles and good lacing throughout the tasting.  The smell is big with strong complex malts and ample hops. The malt is hard to pick up, but notes of toffee and caramel are noticeable. Some burnt but not quite astringent smells are noticed. The hops have a citrus extreme twinge that boarders piney or grapefruit notes.  The taste is well balance and hoppy for a Strong Ale. If the stronger notes from the malt were less or at least lighter, this could be a DIPA. To start the hops are aggressive but not to the point of oily. A more specific grapefruit taste where citrus meets tart. The bitterness has a good kick that stays ever after you finish your taste. Over time you adjust to it and more of the finishing hops come out with a earthy piney taste to them. The malt is big with a full body and flavor. A good mix of caramel and molasses. The ABV is not as noticeable but as it warms becomes more apparent.  Overall a good beer. Very smooth with good taste.

147,92,John1985,4.23,I finally tried Arrogant Bastard and at $6/bomber I waited for a special occassion (birthday) to treat myself. I have to admit this was TREAT!  Poured a brown amber with a beautiful white head. Aroma has a spicy hoppiness. Powerfully flavored with smashing hops upfront which slides into deep rich malitness. The sweetness/bitterness combination is amazing. Aftertaste is pleasantly bitter. An excellent strong ale. With an abv at 7.2% it is alot easier to take than Bigfoot but with all the flavor you could want. I wish this came in six packs!,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,WaffleSauce,4.57,". This is the beer that started it all for me. The first time I had ABA was the first time I saw the light. . .  Poured from a bomber into my trusty Stone pint glass. Nice, frothy head, about 1"" - 3/4"", an eggshell brown head, Hardly any bubbles to speak of, and not a whole lot of lacing action.  I could sit and smell this beer all day. The nose just beckons you to jump in. Very sweet, and tart, an almost prune-like hint.  Strong tart taste up front which hangs on to the front of your tongue, and quickly rolls down the throat as a spicy, piney taste. Its damn near impossible to keep up with how quickly the profile of this beer changes on you. I know there were some deeper fruity and coffee flavors in there between the upfront tart and the rolling spice, but its worthless trying to track them all.  This was (and still is) my favorite beer to watch a movie with. As your glass mellows, and the beer changes temperature, youll get a slightly different taste down to the last drop. Call me a wussy, but I dont like to drink these one after the other. Generally following an Arrogant Bastard, I like to move to some sort of hoppy IPA. This bear is definitely heavy and complex, and tends to leave one with cottonmouth reminiscent of high school days. Definitely recommended for any fan of strong ales. If youve never had it, read the back before you buy it. It aint lying!  Cheers!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The flavor is much the same, loads of bitterness, loads of complex hoppy flavors, and tons of hop aroma. Only the slightest hint of a malty caramel flavor develops on the end palate, but is quickly overtaken by bitterness.  This leaves your mouth feeling dry and begs for another sip.

147,92,edskirk3,4.4,"Bought myself a big-ass 22oz bottle the other night. It's screen-painted (you know, like a Rolling Rock bottle) with a cocky gargoyle on the front. At the bottom it says I'm not worthy.  Very faintly etched near the bottom: Enjoy by 04 13 06.  Poured into a pint glass: Looks a little syrupy. Deep, satanic shade of amber with an off-yellow, tightly beaded head that does not stick around too long. While the head exists, the aroma is sweet with hoppy undertones. The two seem to be fighting for my attention. When the head dissipates, it's hops. Big time.  The taste at first tongue contact is BITTER. Aggresively so. ""This is an aggressive beer,"" it says on the back label. It's the first sentence! I keep smelling and tasting and it's all HOPS. ""Aggressive hops,"" like I was warned by the bottle. Hops just attacking my senses.  I pour more of the bottle into my pint glass and the head rematerializes. The aroma is sweet again, until the foam goes away and then it's back to the onslaught of hops.  My lips start to feel stickier with each taste. And I can't get over how deeply red this beer is. This is the beer from Hell. Like something that would be served to you in Hell's Ironic Punishment Division because you drank too much beer when you were alive. But I'm really enjoying this.  The aftertaste is something I've never experienced with beer before. It's kind of gassy. Not grassy, I actually meant gassy. Specifically it reminds me of when you eat a hard pretzel that has too much salt on it. Salt vapors.  I look at the label again, at the gargoyle snarling and hoisting a mug at me (should I have used a mug?!) like he knew this would all happen.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,phishgator,4.43,"Wow! ...this poured into an imperial pint glass allows the head to foam freely. Impressive aroma of grainy malt, much like a scotch ale. The flavor is unique. I find it hard to place my finger on it, but thick, sticky-sweet malt mixed with a bit of roated quality. Very close to the taste of a scotch ale, whiskey-like upfront bite. The taste is the highlight of this brew (one of a kind)! The mouthfeel is full and sticky, not too many of these in any one sitting. The drinkability suffers from the same and the fact alcohol isn't light. I enjoyed this brew and will look for it in the furture. I was also plesantly surprised by the taste.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,PeatReek,3.75,"Appearance: Pours with a huge tan-beige head, very deep copper/brown body, but still crystal clear enough to be see-throughable even at this deep shade. Looks yummy.  Aroma: hops! Citrusy and a bit grassy. Lemon, with nutty undertones (but in a good way!). I can smell a nice, deep meaty hop flavor coming on. Mouth watering.  Taste & mouthfeel: A little hoppy up front, though not quite as I was expecting from the nose. That's OK, though. Initial hop flavor gives way immediately to a huge round sweetness and thick, chewy body. Sweetness is more along the lines of caramel; not as bready as I had expected. Sweetness is well-balanced by a smooth bitterness late in the sip. The alcohol flavor is very pronounced; I've had smoother 7.2% beers. Unfortunately has a somewhat sour bitterness in the aftertaste.  Drinkability: Hoo mama. So conflicted. The delicious aroma keeps me chugging this bomber, but I'm pretty sure I won't be having a second.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,RJLarse,4.11,"I picked up a 700 ml bottle of Arrogant Bastard to taste and review. I love the silk screened bottle and witty label. I poured this beer into a pint tumbler.  Pours a brilliant red/brown color, clear and appears mildly effervescent. The head is a rich three fingers of foam, with an orange/tan head. The head is quite resilient and produced maximum lacing on the glass. I had to get a fresh glass for the second pint.  The smell is quite strong, sweet and sour at the same time, and has a very hoppy aroma.  The taste is complex and there is a range of taste sensations with each swig. The initial taste is of sweet malt and a hint of citrus, grapefruit and lemon. On the swallow is turns sharply bitter, and tastes strong like a barley wine. The aftertaste is also a combination of sweetness and bitters. Very difficult to describe. The taste of alcohol is also present.  Mouth feel is moderately heavy, not really thick, but certainly not light. It may be somewhat syrupy, but that sensation is short-lived due to the bitterness.  This is a moderately drinkable beer. Certainly not an everyday kind of beer, and I wouldnt want to have more than a couple in a session. It is a very complex and challenging beer. I would certainly have it again, and probably will.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ghostwalker,4.21,"Ruby red body with a nice solid finger of white head.  Scent is tart malt with distinct hop presence.  Flavor is intense with more of the tart maltiness and some fruitiness, with a sour hop finish. Like the label says ""This is an aggressive beer"". It is, it has good, solid strong flavoring that is remarkably well balanced.  Mouthfeel is medium and highly carbonated.  Drinkability is very high. AB is far too easy to drink, always a joy to have.

147,92,drumstik,4.25,Pours dark amber with an off white head that slowly dissapears.  Smells of sweet toasted malt and very up front hops.  Big malty sweetnes and roasted/toasted malts up front. Then a surge of hop bitterness and a little bit of alcohol.  Goes down smooth but it is very complex and agressive. This one is very complex and more flavors come out as it warms up. Too bad this is so hard to find near me because I would love to make it a regular.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,Citadel82,4.32,Purchased at New World Beverages on Chrystie Street here in Manhattan. What a treat!  Poured a dark amber color with ruby highlights and a large off white head. The head receded down to a 1/2 inch and stayed around for a good while. Left some moderate lacing on the glass.  Smell was good some grapefruit pith and a toasted malt. For  I like others was expecting a hoppy over the top brew. The dominant taste is malt. Sweet caramel malt with some citrus/piney notes. Overall this beer ended up being balanced.  The mouthfeel is medium and smooth.  This is a very drinkable and tasty beer.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,JayQue,4.53,"Poured a dark ruby/amber color with a large off white head. The head shrunk down to a 1/2 inch and lingered for a good while. Smell was good some citrus but mostly a malt/toasted malt smell. For some reason I was expecting a hops blast from this beer, but I must have missed something somewhere. The predominant taste is malt, but not a chalky strong malt taste. This is a somewhat sweet caramel malt taste, very balanced and very nice. The mouthfeel is rich and smooth. I did not taste any raw alcohol at all. Left some moderate lacing on the glass. Knowing this was 7.2 ABV and served in a 22 oz. bottle, I would respect this and drink slowly. However I would have no problem accepting a second one. (48 oz of anything is about my sessions limit anyway) This is a very drinkable and tasty beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,gbarron,3.77,"Served from a 22 oz. 'bomber.' No dating or other notations on the bottle giving it's age.  A - dark ruby. Slight protein haze, it appears. Head is off-white, beads up about a finger width's, then dissipates. What's left is a little, muddled pool of bubbles. Nice lacing.  S - strong, citrusy, grapey, piney hop smell. Not sure of the type, probably cascades or another NW american hop variety. Sweet malt aroma in the background.  T - grapefruit! Strong, NW american hop flavor - citrus, grapefruit. Strong bitterness evident and dominating malt flavor. Slight malt sweetness in the background, but hops are upfront. Not only very bitter, but very strong hop flavor as well. Impossible to dissect the malt bill here due to the hop dominance. Some toasty malt flavor. Bitterness strong, but not overwhelming to me.  M - medium bodied, low cabonation. Mouthfeel a little sticky, don't know if its from the hops or malt.  D - surprisingly drinkable given the bitterness, mouthfeel, and alcohol content.  Overall, a tasty brew, but I'm a little surprised at all the really high ratings.

147,92,Optimat0r,2.81,"appearance - comes in a big 1pt6oz bottle. the bottle is plain but has lots of fun writing on it. it also informs me that i 'probably wont like it'. color is a deep reddish-amber.  taste - when Stone hops go bad. i love Stone's IPA, their hops are the best. but here they go waaaay overboard. this beer tastes like a copper metallic penny. tastes like metal. gross, horrible aftertaste. i first tried this as a total novice so i thought id give it another shot, but it was even worse the second time around. i cannot make it through the bomber, i still find it hardly drinkable. i guess im not worthy.  drinkability - terrible. its a quality beer for sure, but just too relentlessly hoppy bitter. should maybe be called Bitter Bastard. certainly a must-try, but i dont think ill be having this again. unless you like the taste of metal, you probably wont take it past your first try. good for the experience though...what novice beerfan could resist that bottle's appeal?",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Finally, after multiple bombers of this over the last couple years, I've gained a real appreciation for this strange brew.

Very well rounded despite the earth-shaking hops and notable alcohol content.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Thin off white head falls quickly to light lacing that sticks to the glass as I drink. Aroma is sweet and malty with some floral and citrus hoppy notes present as well. Smells of caramel/molasses and slight hints of alcohol sting the nose appropriately. Tastes rich and hoppy, nice malting holds it all together, very well balanced with a bit of a bite present in the tail from the 7.2% abv.

147,92,Shovelbum,4.15,"Pours a thin yet dense and creamy off-white head over an amber mahogany body. The head recedes rather rapidly, but leaves some delicate bands of lace behind. Aromas of sweet malt and ripe vinous fruitperhaps a hint of floral hops as well. Sweet vinous fruit are up front in the taste, but quickly give way to a wave of grapefruit-like hop bitterness. Warming alcohol presence combines with a spicy character from the hops to make this a welcome source of heat. Medium to full-bodied and moderate carbonation. Crisp and drying mouthfeel.  This drinks a lot like a barleywine with a little less mouthfeel and sweetness. The hops play a lead role, but the subtle malt is still detectable and has quite a bit of complexity.

The bottle has a humerous warning on the back, telling how no one is worthy of this arrogant brew. Fantastic appearance, deep ruby red in color. Awesome frothy two inch thick, clumpy head. Lots of sticky lacing, that lasts forever. Very strong aromas, lots of citrus fruits, mostly grapefruit and lots of piney hops. Also, I noticed a slight bubblegum smell. This brew has a well balaced hop and malt taste. Lots of flavor, with a slight bitter alcohol burn as it finishes. Unbelievably smooth brew even at 7.2%abv. Easy to drink.

Unabashedly cocky, an in your face profile that matches the name of the beer. That being said, there is so much going on here it is hard for me to distinguish distinct flavours.  Moderate thickness in the mouth with a hop kick to the tastebuds... moderately carbonated.

147,92,TheManiacalOne,4.63,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. The bottle tells me that I'm not worthy. Let's find out.  A: Nice deep brownish-crimson color with thick, even tan head and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: Strong hoppy smell that lets you know your drinking a beer that doesn't mess around. There's also some malt and a bit of sweet fruitiness in the smell as well. Nice combination.  T: A heavy, bitter hop flavor hits you right off-the-bat, but it's not the ""Eew, this beer tastes awful"" kind of taste that you get with some beers. It's more of a ""Yeah. This beer is hardcore!"" I'd call it a ""kick"" but it stays throughout each and every sip and in the after-taste as well. So, by definition, it's not really a ""kick"" it's more like a ""strangle-hold."" The strong hop flavor is complimented very nicely by the same malt sweetness that you get in the smell.  M: Crisp, smooth, medium-bodied. The carbonation is just right.  D: This beer is most certainly drinkable, but only for one who appreciates good beer. I could go with this stuff all night long, but that wouldn't do the beer justice. After a couple of 22oz bottles, I would switch to some other ""buzz maintainer"" that I won't need to taste.  If you're used to drinking the common beers of the big 3 (Miller/Bud/Coors) don't try to broaden your experience with this stuff, because it will probably turn you off, but if you're reading this review, you'll be fine.

147,92,Tupperwolf,4.63,"How did I take so long to review this beer? Pours from a 650ml bottle with no freshness date (not like it's necessary when buying 30 miles from the brewery) into my nonic glass that characteristic Arrogant Bastard color - darkest scarlet, quite clear, with a fantastic very tan head that hangs around to the last dregs and leaves lovely, thick lacing.  The smell is a one-two punch, very speedy - a whack of sleek, sweet, high-quality malt followed by the knuckles of grapefruity-bitter hops. Very Arrogant indeed. I always love the smell of this, because I know what comes next...  Mmmm... The taste... So much character in this beer. My preference is to take a couple of nice sips and then just relax. So many interesting things happen during and after swallowing that just make this beer. You get the mild taste of malts, followed by an oily smack of hops, but once you swallow, the beer's real flavors come to life. Sweet caramel tingles the tip of the tongue, hop oils cling like velcro to the rear, and the throat is glazed with a gorgeous caramel. All the flavors just cling and cling and combine into a harmony of flavors - sweet, bitter.  Mouthfeel is spot on. Carbonation is there without getting in the way of those flavors - it conspires to simultaneously soothe and tingle different parts of the tongue. Medium body that leaves behind a heavy, delicious aftertaste. The alcohol is present, playing a fantastic supporting role.  One of my absolute favorites, and not just because of the marketing (though I am a whore for Stone's attitude). Hopefully this will be available everywhere soon enough, converting the curious into the truly Arrogant.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Then, on the first sip, the hops take hold of the tongue and stick to it, very slowly fading away.  Quite carbonated. Nicely warming. ABV is apparent, but this is not the big scary beer it makes itself out to be. Next to a Big A IPA, for instance, it faints away. Still, it's one I drink on a fairly frequent basis. I ordered another one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

This is my dad's favorite beer and he always has a case of 22oz. bottles out in his beer fridge. After trying this again today, I am so glad I have the palate to appreciate what Stone is doing here. Poured into what Stone calls their ""Way Cool Glass""....it is pretty cool actually. A deep rich caramelized amber with a lingering sticky head and amazing staying power. Nose is very aromatic and complex with the expected sweet caramel malts and over the top hops, but unexpectedly a distinct fruity profile as well, strawberries? Taste is intense and as the label warns, not for the faint of heart or the macro swill drinking sissy....the over-the-top hop profile will definitely weed those folks out, however this is actually a fairly balanced recipe. The malts are very well done and full of sweetness which is present up-front and then are blown away by the fruit-juicy fresh hop taste and texture....only to come back again for the finish which leaves you smacking your lips with a slightly cloying sweetness.

Arrogant Bastard pours a deep ruby amber with an impressive chocolate milk colored head that slowly fades into a fine lace. The nose picks up alcohol and citrus. Grapefruit and pineapple (yes, pineapple). It smells incredibly warm and inviting. The taste is hard to describe. A full frontal attack on the senses. Alcohols warms you going down. Bitter finish.  Perhaps I'm not quite ready for Arrogant Bastard. It is highly recommended by the reviewers at BA and I figured I'd try it. I will continue to try the beers recommended by BA.

It's aroma about knocked me over; plenty of hops and sweet fruits, piney, caramel, roasted malts. The taste was much of the same, but balanced excellently, with a barrage of sweet caramel and roasted malts up front, fading into a spicy, bitter hop finish. I can not emphasize enough the complexity and balance of this beer. Since I had it in the larger bottle, and the ABV is decently high, AND the tastes are in your face, I wouldn't try to polish off more then one or two of these in one sitting.

Strong hoppiness is tasted immdeiately, but wait, there is a nice carmel sweetness on top of it to balance it out. The finish is crisp and bitter, but not overdone.

Taste is nice. Strong cherry flavor early is smashed by hoppy bitterness at the middle. The bitterness lasts throughout. It's a strong bitterness, but not a bad one. It's enjoyable despite the marketing telling you otherwise.  Medium bodied. Light carbonation. A bit slick actually. The finish is long. Not necessarily an impressive mouthfeel.  This wasn't my first one and it won't be my last, so it's pretty drinkable. I do usually tend to switch to something a little sweeter after one of these though.

147,92,longarm,3.43,"Rich and deep brown color with a thick yellow-brown head of foam that generated excellent lacing. Good consistent carbonation.  Aroma dominated by combination of flowery and piney hops. A strong malty backbone brings a little sweetness to the nose as well.  I was expecting a super-bitter, bad-ass brew. Not that I'm disappointed, but it's a little more balanced than I expected. Undoubtedly the hops play a leading role in this beer, delivering a healthy dose of bitter pine. The bitter burn fades a little in the middle, only to appear again at the end for a big kick, if perhaps a bit hot.  The mouthfeel of this beer falls apart. I guess they warn you with the name, but I can't say that I like it. The bitterness takes over too much and scrubs the lining off of the inner part of my mouth.  Somewhat drinkable beer in spite of the name. Don't be afraid, just a little skeptical. I've heard great things from Stone and this might be the first brew of theirs that I've had.

Fruity but not sweeet. The clean and large hop bouquet is crisp.  Taste: Boom! This is what seperates the IPA fans from everyone else. Smooth and sharp with a slight oak which has leveled out to much of a bite.  Hops dominate bit the balance of this brew allows a complexity that makes it more than a one-trick pony.

Dark amber, about a cm of head, lot's of lace. Faint hops with some complexity in the nose. This beer is all about the taste. I get immediate sweetness, good natural honey like sweetness. Then some citrus hop taste capped off by some intense hoppiness. It's the hops that make this beer. I don't know enough about hop types to distinguish the types, but I know that I like them. I like them a lot. No, No, I love them. This is an aggresive in your face, kick your ass beer.

147,92,Hagbard,4.6,"Arrogant Bastard is easily one of my favorite beers. When I realized I've never gotten around to writing a review, I thought it would be fitting that I'll most likely earn my mug with this review. This bastard is a deep amber. It has fairly good clarity and a thick tan head forms from the pour. The aroma is powerful, resplendent with piney hops and an overriding maltiness that seems easily to be the equal of the hops. The taste is a wonderfully complex interplay of malty sweetness and hoppy biterness. The hops provide a piney oiliness that coats the tongue and creates an almost mouth puckering effect. This is cut rather quickly by the huge malt base that exists and all of a sudden I can't figure out whether the overriding taste is bitter or sweet. During the swallow, the alcohol provides a bit of a burn down the throat and warms the stomach. This beer is truly an experience. The aftertaste, mostly hops, lasts well after the swallow due to the mouth coating feel of the beer. Very sticky and chewy. The drinkability isn't great due to the stickiness and intense flavors. The 22oz bottle is plenty. Still, it's a beer I would never turn down.

Be careful if you are not drinking this at home.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,xoqx,3.8,"Appearance - This beer pours amber-red with a tan, two finger head exhibiting moderate retention and heavy lacing.  Smell  There are heavy, dark citrus smells coupled with spicy, honey, fruity, and even herbal scents.  Taste - This beer tastes bready, with complex caramel, fruity, and herbal tastes. The hops are fruity, but not Belgian-tasting. There is a long, dry, spicy finish with wonderful bitterness.  Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is alcoholic, chewy, and somewhat creamy.  Drinkability  Its high ABV% makes it slightly less drinkable, but its complexity and taste make it super desirable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,SwillinBrew,4.82,"One of my favorite brews so i thought i'd finally review it. Had on tap at Heroes in Fullerton.  A - a beautiful rich mohogany copper with a solid finger of bone white head. Nice lace down my glass. Color is really fantastic. S - Mmmm, you will salivate. A wall of crisp grapefruit hit your nose then leans over towards a sweeter malt on the end... but the grapefruit is still present. T - More grapefruit and you definitely know the hops are still here. Citrus grapefruit invade your tonge leading towards a milder sweet plum or dark fruit flavor. A great taste for damn sure. M&Dr - Mouthfeel is solid with perfect carbonation that is ever present like scrubbing bubbles, not harsh but smooth if you can believe. I can drink this until i fall like a fresh cut tree.

147,92,Terp96,4.69,"On tap at the Flying Sauce, Addison, TX for $2.50 a pint.  Pours a deep mahogony with a slightly off white head. The one finger thick head has excellent retention as evidenced by the extensive lacing down my glass.  Smell is ridiculous. I mean this in a fantastically complex way. You know from the first whiff that everything is there. A citrusy hop aroma with ripened, dark fruit. Bitter and sweet all wrapped up in one glass.  Taste is equally as fine. A syrupy sweetness of plum, raisins, fig??, followed by the hop bomb finish. This one is punishing but you come crawling back for another sip every time.  Mouthfeel is excellent as well. The syrupy sweetness lingers throughout and changes as you move down the glass. Very sweet at first but more finished and refined at the end. Conversly, the hop bitterness remains the same throughout. One of the most complex beers I have ever had.  The drinkability of this one is the only fault. This is a big beer and you get reminded of this often. I would say it is too complex to have as your regular beer. You want to savor this one and revisit it occassionally because I guarantee it will seem different everytime.  ""Thank you sir. May I have another!!!""",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,clabaugh,4.33,"Appearance: Pours a deep reddish amber with a french vanilla head. The head is full, creamy, and extremely encouraging. The lacing coats the glass thoroughly, leaving remnants as thick as the head itself.  Smell: A hoppy aroma with some floral esters. Malts distinguish themselves with their sweetness: brown sugar, plum, and clove. A wonderful sensual experience.  Taste: Prolific hoppy bitterness accented by some sweet, malty fullness. Nicely balanced, as the floral hops blend effectively with what strike me as wheaty malts. Clearly some grape flavors, along with brown sugar to enhance the sweetness. Excellent taste.  Mouthfeel: Wonderfully full and rich. A little chewy, mildly bitter, and well balanced. An experience not to be forgotten.  Drinkability: Hides the 7.2% abv well. I could easily imbibe several of these in an evening. Thoroughly pleasing, massively hospitable, and pure in its flavor and smell. A fine drinking engagement I would recommend to anyone who fancies a fine beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Appearance: The beer pours a deep brown color with almost not head.  Smell: Flowery, piney hops dominate the smell. Not much else was present.  Taste: Hops dominate the taste, but in a good way. Roasted malts make up a strong backbone that appears after the beer warms up a bit.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is very good. Chunky hops and malts give the beer a lightly chewy feeling.  Drinkability: Don't know how much of this I could drink in one night, but I would definetly come back to this beer in the future.

Appearance: Dark amber with a bunch of bubbles floating up toward the middle. Really small champagne-like bubbles. Nice sticky lacing and a head that stays at about 1/2"" after it's 1"" head dissipates a bit.  Smell: A fantastic and singular combination between big, juicy fruits, and big, oily hops, with piney and grapefruit and citrus notes. Dark berries, slight strawberry. Dark bread and thick yeast. Ultimately dark dark fruit too. So complex it's hard to pick everything out.  Taste: Damn this is tasty, and yes, it's not for the untrained palate probably. Huge presence of malt and hops that are coming together very, very well. Huge notes of bread and yeast too. The finish is huge oily hops and resides on the tongue for a long, long time: specifically, the dark berries, and the oily and bitter hop presence. Some how a near-perfect and creamy meld of the delicious notes of malt and hops. Even more complex than the aroma, and there's much to be discovered as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Amazingly and unexpectedly creamy. Carbonation is perfect, providing the feeling of velvet at the finish. Also makes the body seem less huge than it is. Certainly deserves a perfect score.  Drinkability: In my opinion this is one of the most complex and tasty brews that's very widely available in the U.S. It can certainly kick your ass, so it's not something to mess around with, but with a good meal or as a sipper it's tough to beat this brew.

Hardly any carbonation visible.  Smell: Smell is sweet carmel, toasted malt, and some alcohol.  Taste: Hops, there are a lot of them in this beer. Burnt malt flavoring, slight carmel sweetness. Hops are huge, juicy and satisfying. Unique and assertive. Slight coffee flavor, also.  Mouthfeel: Full and creamy, perfect.  Drinkability: Listed as an American Strong Ale, but what does that mean? This is a big dark ale, very hoppy and pleasing. So if the ASA designation is a catchall for strong ales that can't be pigeonholed, this is what I would want from one of those beers. Thanks to Px2Grafx.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,thesilverhand,4.48,"Thanks to Naerhu for recently bringing this across the Pacific. You've brought so many good beers into my life -- thanks!  It pours a deep dark garnet red capped with a finger-and-a-half of yellowed parchment foam. A beautiful beer.  Coniferous hops...a veritable forest of hoppy aromas assault my senses. Sweet (?!) sap-laden spruce cones and grapefruit. A thick aroma, with a good malt underbelly. Sweet despite the near-overwhelming hops.  The first taste is juicy. While I expected nothing but hops, this beer has so much to offer. Yes, it's hoppy, but it maintains a very nice balance, with a great malt base that is almost sweet. Hops are definitely the main attraction -- not a bad thing! -- and they lead to a long, bitter finish. I can taste deep, green spruce forests long after the beer is gone. Mmm.  It is extremely resinous and bitter. This is not a problem, but when coupled with carbonation and a bit of alcohol heat, it feels somehow ""sharp"" on my palate. It's certainly not unpleasant, though. Just a bit less impressive than the other aspects. I can feel lingering hop oils coating my mouth. Nice.  While it does a decent job of living up to its own self-professed aggression, it manages to still be a well-balanced, highly drinkable beer. Obviously not something I would drink all night (unless the ability to stand was not a priority) but...wow.

Alfalfa-grassy, grapefruit-citric, and rose-floral hops. An undercurrent of caramel malts comes through, but you have to really sniff for it. This has a a lot of what I'd describe as ""va-voom."" A very alluring nose.  Taste: Much more malty than the smell (but still predominantly hoppy); a well-balanced ale. The hops are mostly grapefruit pith with a grassy character. Finish could be a bit cleaner, but on the whole, this is one yummy beer.  Mouthfeel: The beer's finish is ultimately crisp, dry, and hoppy, but it starts off strangely sticky and cloying. Other than that, no complaints. Smooth mouthfeel.  Drinkability: I should have bought the six-pack instead of just the bomber.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Mouthfeel- thick, oily, slight alcohol presence, a pleasent aftertaste but a little rough at first.  Overall- my 2nd time having the Arrogant bastard and it was better this time around.

Then my non beer drinking little sister moved to Brooklyn, bless her heart and it's like I've been reborn with all the good beers that are suddenly within my reach. Today enjoyed the famed Bastard on tap at the atlantic Chip Shop on the Avenue of the same name in Brooklyn Heights and I can say without exaggeration that with this one, you can believe the hype. Served in a proper imperial pint glass, this Bastard is dark brown with nice ruby highlights and an attractive but thin head that didn't last. The smell was bursting with hops and shadowed by mild bouquets of metal and alcohol. I can't explain it so well, but it smell's better than my description. The taste is again showered in delicious hops with a nicely bitter aftertaste that gives way to a mellowness that stays in the mouth long after the swallow. This beer is very pleasant to your mouth with a smooth, crisp bite that breaks at the right time. This is a beer that is so meticulously crafted that it's brilliance makes it seem simple and is truly a satisfying drink. Maybe a bit too much alcohol and kamikaze hops for binging but I can attest that having one with lunch is close to nirvana.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,EStreet20,4.7,"22 ounce brown bomber bottle with rather Arrogant looking Gargoyle telling me I'm not worthy. Poured into a Brooklyn snifter.  A - A deep, deep red color that approaches brown but still lets quite a bit of light through. A very nice looking bubbly two finger head forms and stays around very well.  S - A nice hop aroma complemented by a nice alcohol kick with a ton of a fruity smell. Perhaps like a spiked fruit punch.  T - A nice smooth flavor that begins with a nice hop profile. After that the fruity flavor kicks in with a very assertive roasted (almost burnt) flavor coming into the mix. The hops come back big in the finish, but meld with the roasted flavors more than dominating.  M - Nice and smooth on the tongue. Feels full and refreshing upon each sip.  D - Really makes you come back for more. Not one to pound all night but one to relax and enjoy, if you're worthy that is.

147,92,chOAKbarrell,3.58,"I hate to say it, but I am just not blown away by this beer. I guess all the hype just sends your expectations far too high to be met.  Arrogant Bastard pours the darkest amber color with a creamy, almost Guinness-style head, that does not die away.  The smell is a lot like a barleywine, with a lot of malt & hops, and a strong alcohol scent underneath.  I find the taste to be very similar to a barleywine as well. Very strong alcoholic finish that I am not into. You can taste strong hop characters after the alcohol flavor washes over your tongue. Dry and bitter.  The mouthfeel is very smooth and full, which is nice. A pleasant creaminess is found as well. Very strange how smooth the mouthfeel is, when the actual taste & finish of this beer is rather harsh.  I don't think I'd be too interested in drinking multiple bottles of this in a row. It's just too rough, alcoholic, and pricey.

147,92,becktone,4.88,"This beer looks great and also looks very appetizing when poured out of the bottle and into a glass. It has a dark brown reddish color and is crystal clear. When held up to the light the nice red color comes out very nicely. It froms a beautiful large head when poured that never gets smaller than about a 1/4 of an inch. The creamy head also has a good amount of lacing which adds to its appetizing look. I don't think that they look much better than this.  The aroma of this beer can be characterized by one word, hops. The aroma of hops is overwhelming in this brew, it dominates not only the smell of this beer but the flavor as well.  If you like really hoppy beers then I think that you'll love this one. There is almost no hint of any malty or sweet flavor in this beer. There is a small malt flavor but it is really unbalanced by the amount of hop flavor this beer has. Other than that I can't really describe the flavor of this beer. I taste something that lingers in my mouth afterwards that reminds me of wood, like I have been chewing on a stick or something.  This beer feels good on the palate. It is a full bodied beer and feels heavy on the palate. The level of carbonation is low, which is in my opinion appropriate to the style. It is not a beer that can be chugged, rather it has to be drunk over time. Its a great brew to sit down and enjoy. This beer is really a gem, one of the best brews I have ever had, I'll always respect the bastard and will always find myself coming back to this brew again and again. It is definitely worth the money and a try. Go ahead and see if you're worthy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

A 3/4"", off-white head forms, then slowly collapses into a soapy ring. Moderate carbonation; layers of delicate lace forms. The aroma is delightfully complex. To begin with, the sheer smell of the hops is dominating; this beer smells like fresh hop leaves. Wait a little bit, and the aroma elements come through - several fruit/citrus smells (grapefruit, pineapple, apple) along with a slightly sweet aroma from the alcohol. A slight hint of caramel rounds out the mix of smells.  This beer tastes amazing. Initially, the taste is fairly bitter (but not overpoweringly so); after a little bit, a fairly intense citrus flavor comes through - in particular, that of grapefruit. A slight toasted malty and alcohol-infused sweetnes. Everything comes together so very well. The mouthfeel is thick, yet light. Moderately dry, finishes very crisp, with a very pleasant acid citrusy bitterness.  Overall, Arrogant Bastard has lived up to the hype; it is one great and incredibly tasty beer.

Like a combination of a barleywine and an DIPA. There's a roasty sweet character at the beginning, but then the hops come in to give your tongue a nice beating. Taste is malt and apple, and then sweet hop oil. Oh my word! This is quite enjoyable. My first Stone brew in fact. I have been wanting to try their beer for over a year now. I like it. This is a fairly simple beer, but even the complexity of the flavor change from sweet to bitter give this one a fine score. I look forward to more fine Stone brews. I can't wait to try the IPA that is in the fridge.  Mouthfeel: Mmmm. Smooth and coating, but the carbonation does a great job of keeping the beer from being to syrupy. Excellent.  Drinkability: Very good. There is a good amount of alcohol in here to give you a warming sensation, and the hops, oh the hops are just so tasty. I can't wait to try double bastard or ruination.

Hops are readily apparent right up front, but I could be saying that because I'm midway through the bottle and the hop aftertaste reminds me of an IPA.  As far as taste goes: woah. A firm, sweet, roasted malt texture hits first, followed immediately by a brutal blast of bitter hops. It takes most of the bottle to detect all the flavors here, especially across the temperature range.  This is one to hand your wine nerd friends to prove the legitimacy of us BeerAdvocates.

It pours a cloudy tan head with a deep amber color- with a tinge of orange. This beer smells bittersweet. It has a very deep floral scent and multiple layers of hops. The hops definitely do not match the color of the beer. The smell prepares you for the hoppy bang you get from your first sip. It has a fantastic kick on the back of the tongue with the malt gently balancing it at the tip of the tongue. The tongue is lightly coated before it kicks you. This is a very hoppy, very potent beer.

It went nicely with the Pride Fighting Championships PPV I was watching while drinking it. As far as the PPV goes I'll just say the Shamrock v. Saku fight was stopped too early - Shamrock was not out. Now back to the beer.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and full-bodied. I really like beers like this. They feel 'big' in your mouth.

Dark red, brown rust color with sticky lace most of the way through the glass. Nice light khaki up top, almost like some stouts.  Smells great, all fruity hops, oranges, pears, green apples with a lingering maltiness somewhere in the back there.  Great taste, citrusy, fruity, above all else, holy crap hoppy. I understand this is a beer that tries to be overbearing, but I don't think it's remotely unpleasant and never is it just too much. (Although Double Bastard may be another story, never been able to get it, so I'm excited for Monday.) Can't taste the alcohol until maybe the last little bit of the glass, but it's also not unpleasant at all. Kind of how you can taste the alcohol in a tripel, as opposed to something like how you can taste it in Old Rasputin.  Slick, but really well carbonated, smooth, with a nice twang from the even, steady carbonation.  Drinkability...well, this a huge beer, big alcohol content, really bitter. I am not worthy...of more than 2 or maybe 3 in a sitting.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,LPorter33,3.73,"22oz bomber from Martignetti's  Appearance = nice looking dark red, rust brown with just a speck of transparency. Good 1/4'' head which took awhile to fade. Noticable carbonation. Impressive lacing.  Smell = Great fruit like scent detectable - plums & pears. A definite sweet malt presence along with some powerful hops. This smells like it will be very well balanced.  Taste = This definitely packs a punch. Quite bitter upfront but ends with a toasted coffee malt flavor and a tiny bit of sweetness from the malt. Hop kick initially is decent. It's slightly too rough though - I wish they could hide the alcohol just a tiny bit more. It's still an impressive beer with a lot of flavor. I do think it's slightly overrated.  Overall = Definitely try it if you haven't. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out again but would certainly accept one if it came across my path.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,les1721,4.5,"It's appearence is a dark reddish brown with an incredible frothy white lace that doesn't leave.  The smell is very complex. Sweetness from the malts (caramel, nuts, fruit, toasted malts), intense floral and bitter hops and alcohol.  The taste in my opinion couldn't get any better. It's so complex that it is hard to describe. It's very bitter at first but then you start to notice all the flavors coming from the malts, then hops again, alcohol and then a sweet aftertaste.  Because the beer is so strong the drinkability isn't to high. It's better to just drink a 22 of Arrogant Bastard then go to something a bit lighter like an I.P.A.  This beer has definetly brought beer to a new level and changed my whole way of thinking about beer. It's in my top three.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,hero27,4.28,"22oz bomber is a work of art from Stone. Gotta love the words of wisdom on the bottle, ""This is an aggressive beer. You probably won't like it."" Well, I did like it, but they may still be right about me not being worthy.  Pours a dark, rusty ruby color. Leaves uniform lacing around the glass. The aroma is devilish..smells like there are plenty of brutal hops just underneath the surface of this one..with a toasted malt aroma lingering as well. Taste surprised me, though..much more balanced than I would of expected..the toasted caramel malts really shine through in the taste, but somehow leave a lingering bitterness on the tongue that may take days to wear off. Very reminiscent of a barleywine, actually..somewhat reminded me of a cellared SN Bigfoot..the hops more subdued, of course. The malts & hops really do blend together nearly flawlessly in this brew. To be honest, a little more bitterness wouldn't kill this beer. As it is, it's an extreme hop fix, but it's so balanced, there isn't that ""bite"" associated with most overly hoppy beers. Credit the ridiculous balance of ingredients for that. If they should add anything to this beer, it should be this written on the bottle, ""Let this brew warm up to you.. cold it's good, but at room temp, it's divine.""

Flavour has some woody spice right up front, then a quality very similar to the aroma kicks in....still the hops and oranges, with some molasses underneath. There's a slightly different flavour evey second, with a great spicy finish.  The carbonation is not so apparent it puts you off...but it does pop up its head and say hi. What's more noticeable is a very smooth liquid that's not too thick.  I like this one more than I thought I would. Could I get it here, it would be a new session beer in my stable.

147,92,andjusticeforale,3.37,"This poured pretty nice out the bomber bottle, and was a dark amber brown color.  The first thing that hits you is a bitter grapefruit taste. This lingers and lingers and envelopes upon sip after sip and is bitter and never complex or sweet.  There is no real true malt that can be distinguished, because of the bitterness.  Admittedly I am not the biggest fan of hoppy beers, but this is pretty crazy. There is a distinct lack of balance. When you drink a saison you can get sour and sweet, or a well crafted IPA you get intense bitterness and sweet or malt or heft to balance but not. here.  Oh yeah; I read the bottle; I have tried numerous beers from all over the world, and I wouldn't rank this one very highly, or as outstanding, despite the bottle.

The smell is a little odd, but in a good way. I guess I was expecting the heavier hop aromas (which are definitely there: herbal, juicy and piney) but I wasnt expecting such a huge malt presence. Its lightly medicinal without being off-putting. The taste is huge but excellently balanced. The chewy, sweet malts are counterbalanced by the stinging bitter hops wonderfully. I love the caramel flavor in there, and the finish is very long, very bitter and lightly astringent. It has a medium-full body, slightly oily texture and a soft carbonation. Very good all around. And I really enjoyed FINALLY getting to try this, thanks to Ds in Pittsburgh. The great balance and true arrogance of the beer make it quite memorable.

Taste is in your face at first very strong with a grapefruit like bitterness as an aftertaste. After the initial shock to the taste buds you can taste the complex flavors of this beer. There is a carmel like sweetness to this brew that ends in a bitter hoppyness. Mouthfeel is smooth and warming.

Only the first sip and I can already claim it as my best friend. But it's like a best friend who's a real jerk. Bites hard up front with a complex bittersweet hop and doesn't really let up.

147,92,Melchizedek,3.58,"Deep ruby with a solid tan head that dissipates rather quickly but hangs around as a nice sticky lace. Sexay.  The aroma's fruity, sweet and tart at once, with some raspberry/blueberry scent, maybe grape too. In the mouth the fruitiness is subordinated to the aggressive sweet/bready malts and yeast character, not to mention harsh, strong hops. A bit of anise, resin, and some vanilla and cinnamon-apple flavors join in the fun. The body's not heavy, and the carbonation's solid; the bitterness of the hops and spicy alcohol all create a rather harsh mouthfeel. Caramel and bready flavors come back stronger in the end, though the bitterness from the hops is most lingering.  This lives up to the excellent text on the back of the bomber. It's complex, and while I appreciate it, I don't see myself making this a real fridge regular. It's definitely got potential to compete with the IIPAs in my diet, though, and as a sort of indulgence to my inner geek, it succeeds quite well.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

S - Not a very powerful aroma for something as this should be, you can smell the hops and malts but it's a little hushed. It could be due to it's age, but no matter.  T - ""Strong"" ale describes this very well. Hops and malts hit you in the beginning and the end. There is fruit, and a touch of spice, but they last for a very short time in between the hops and malts.  M - Very thin and smooth, one of the smoother I've ever had, no bite on the carbonation, but there is a slight alcohol burn at the very end.

The beer poured a very deep reddish brown with a thick foamy of off white head that peaked up a little over the top of the glass. The head retained incredibly well, and it left plenty of fine lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of huge a huge hop character and also some fruity scents. The taste is big too: big hops and big malts. Everything flavor-wise bounces off around the high alcohol content, which oddly enough is a part of this beer: an integral part of the flavor. A medium to heavy mouthfeel comes with this too, and although the alcohol is high and registers on the palant its still highly drinkable.  The ""Arrogance"" of the gargoyle who adorns the bottle, which I've had but not reviewed, and the tap handle is appropriate, and it's true throughout this beer. Not just the taste but everything that really goes along with this beer. Arrogant Bastard is not for everyone; it's probably too big to for many tastes. But I would recommend this to anyone.

Foremost was a piney hoppiness. There were also a caramel sweetness and a tosted grain scent. Quite a lot going on!  Taste is glorious. The big piney hoppiness in the scent is here, but it's equal partner is a big, almost crude maltiness. This beer tastes big. It IS big.  Medium bodied, with an oily mouthfeel.  This is a great beer.

Wonderful, then the hops step back a bit as the malt makes itself known with a hefty yet subdued caramel flavor. The hops and malt and traces of diacetyl meld into a nice long, somewhat bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium full and works with the medium low carbonation to create a very creamy smooth assault on the palate. Alcohol is present throughout but well integrated. Really terrific, unique.

147,92,waldowin,4.15,"Hitting a hefty 7.2%, it's not a lightweight, and in a 22oz bottle, you better not have plans for the evening. The bottle has a wonderfully emotive sketch of a smug demon leaning out of the print, leering at your inability to comprehend his brew.  It pours a light red, becoming a medium amber in the glass. Develops about a finger's-worth of head which sticks around for a few minutes, shrinking to a ring which clings to the glass all the way down. You can definitely taste the alcohol in this brew, as it adds a bit of an astringent quality to the taste, however this tends to hit at the very end of the swallow, as an aftertaste, giving you all the more reason not to stop swallowing. The initial hit is very smooth and subtle, with a definite malt presence (with some caramel?), but closely followed and neatly balanced by some pretty harsh hops. The overall taste of this ale is somewhat sweet though, which is surprising considering just how harsh it can be when sipped timidly, allowing the aftertaste to dominate. This beer was meant to be drank outright. Somewhere in the middle of the taste is a background of nuts (almonds?), and maybe some raisins. All in all, the taste comes on strong and syrupy (with a definite strength of hops), and fades quickly, with a hint of smoky/bitter showing up later to bite you. It'd be hard to drink much more of this beer than the 22oz serving (I have a hard time almost finishing the 22oz bottle), as the aftertaste of bitter smoke keeps growing. A definite recommended brew, but as far as the rule of ""Is it worth the money"" goes, this beer stays strictly as a ""Man, I really want a harsh Ale tonight"" beer, as it clocks in at $6 for a 22oz bottle.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,SkeeterHawk,4.28,"Appearance: Pours a clean and clear almost blood-red color with about an inch of tan foam at first pour. The head maintained for quite some time. There is quite a bit of lacing on the glass when this beer gets done.  Aroma: Through the foam, all I really get is hops. As the head settles a bit, you can pick out some roast malts and some caramel. The aroma is so hoppy that it is like potpourri.  Taste: This is an aggressive beer! It starts out oozing with hops, and then it somehow ends up being a bubbly malty mess across your palate until it fades into a residual bitter dryness on the back of your throat. Eventually the alcohol will start to show up to try and burn the residual hop oils from your palate. The mouthfeel is right on for a beer this aggressive. It would be practically unpalatable completely flat.  Opinion: OK, here is where it all comes down...what did I think of that all out assault on my face. For the record, I don't really care for really hoppy beers...especially heavy Chinook, which this beer reeks of. Even still, I have to keep trying them because I respect a well-made hoppy beer. I just don't brew any. This beer along with DFH 90min IPA are ones that I frequently enjoy because they are very well crafted beers.

A - Poured a dark ruby brown, with a thick rocky head that slowly settled down to a patchy lace, and continued to leave lacing down the glass.  S - Smells of roasted malts and dark fruit . . . raisins and maybe a touch of licorice. Oh wait, and alcohol - which is a tad astringent.  T - More dark fruits and roasted malts, a touch on the burnt side, but not as burnt tasting as a stout or porter. There's a solid hop kick going on here, but the bitterness seems pretty controlled by the malt flavors. The hops definitely show up in the aftertaste, which seems to linger for a while.

M - This is definitely a full bodied ale. This is one your mouth will be talking about for while. The carbonation is nicely controlled and works well with the alcohol, malts, and hops.  D - This is a juggernaut of an ale. Big bottle. Big Taste. Big Alcohol. A beer this big just can't be consumed in quantity. Ah, if only . . .  This is a fierce ale. One to be treated with respect. I'll reach for Stone's IPA first but this is still an excellent beer. And I think my favorite part is the note on the bottle that reads ""Keep Refrigerated Numbskull!!""

147,92,revdrjbob,4.2,"Finally! I get to taste a great American cult beer in Oz. I'd read soooo much about this beer, managed to work myself up, got all flustered, and was pleasantly suprised with the outcome. Thanks to David Logdson, pres. of WYeast for the brew, plus a few others. You rock! Shared with ScottDog and Tits.  Firstly, I must say that I love the packaging and design, etc. of the bottle, awesome. The Arrogant Bastard poured into oversized wine glasses a dark amber red, with a thin (1cm) lacing of foam that hung around nicely. The glasses were probably a tad warm and dusty... Worked well, plenty of carbonation, a little yeast cloudy. Beer was probably a tad cold too.  Aroma: the AB smelt of a slight hop, a huge malt, a rummy, fruityness, that followed with more hops that became slightly piney. A great aroma, hints of crystal malt and some roastiness.  Flavour: This is what I've been waiting for for sooo long. I gently lift the glass to my lips, and bam! Malt! Hops! Malt! Yum. Evident alcohol, an enourmous malt backbone that carries the 60-odd (?) IBUs along nicely, yet not as hoppy as I would have expected... A piney hop flavour, a slight gummy viscosity in the malt profile. Awesome. There's a lingering of crystal malt in the back palate, alcohol warmth and more definate hop bitterness. Great charachter, loads of body, and definitley worth the wait. I sadly thought there'd be MORE of everything, more of a Double IPA feel, but I guess I'll have to wait for the Ruination for that.  I just wish there were breweries in Australia who have the balls to produce a beer like this. A great beer, I am worthy.

147,92,mushroomcloud,4.2,"Arrogant Bastard is a deep amber color, sort of a mahogany or cherry wood shade, with some bright highlights at the bottom. There is a 1"" beige creamy head with great retention and perfect lacing all the way down.  The aroma is toffee, nice fresh hops and a light roasted malt. The hops smell great and the aroma is very rich overall.  Arrogant Bastard has a wonderful hop bitterness from start to finish. The flavor is complex with caramel, toffee and some fruity banana character thrown in there. There is not much of the roasted character that I usually associate with beers of this color. There is plenty more going on here though. Very well balanced and gets better as it warms up closer to ""cellar"" temperature.  The beer is very full-bodied and rich. As much as I would like to make it a session beer (just split 6 bottles with my old man), be careful, this one is capable of knocking you on your ass!!!

Warns you right off the bat that you probably won't like it- which is why I had to try it. To prove them right, or, hopefully, wrong.  Beautiful looking beer. Deep red/ruby color, lots of tan head that balances perfectly with it. Lacing all down the glass. Almost too pretty to drink. Smell is hoppy, with lots of burnt/roasted scents coming through. A bit of floral scents as well. Intriguing, to say the least.  Taste is just amazing. Lots of coffee and roasted flavors. Espresso. Bitter. Hoppy- and these hops aren't shy, either. There's a subtle sweetness in there, a bit of caramel. The sweet, bitter, roasted flavors all harmonize perfectly- a complex flavor for those who can handle it.  Mouthfeel is chewy, smooth.

Color was red, maybe cherry red? and the contrast of the reddish brew, off-white head was pretty damn appealing.  Smell is slightly alcohol, some malt with hoppiness, and.... man this smell is a bit complex. I guess I picked up on some plum, apricot and maybe oatmeal? Smells great, looks sexy, time to have a taste.  Ok, this is hard to describe. I think the strength of the alcohol taste is masking some of what I was smelling. I was actually quite surprised that this is a 7.2 as I'd have put it around 8.5 based on the flavor. It's also slightly more bitter than I had anticipated, but not in a bad way, it fit's this beer perfectly as it goes down quite smooth and there is a nice light bite after gulping down.

147,92,Quaffer,4.08,"22 oz. bottle. Not available here in Wichita. Thanks, Bruiser81!  Appearance: This clear pouring beer was more red than any other color, though there were some hints of copper. The peach-tan head rose up easily to three fingers, even with a careful pour. It dissipated very slowly, picking up hints of fluffiness. The foam was very sticky and the side of the glass was covered with lace when the beer was gone.  Smell: A great aroma, though I've always thought that the sweetness comes across as sickly. Kind of like how rotting things sometimes have a sweet smell to them. Plus, I've always noticed a certain quality to the aroma that I can only describe as dirty. I just can't quite come up with a better descriptor than that. Oh, well . . . I still like it. :-) Heavy on the sweet malt with hints of raisins, especially right after the pour. Lots of bread, crackers, and lightly roasted malt help to provide a solid base. Oddly enough, I pick a good dose of bubblegum as well. The hops are rather subdued, but are definitely present and are probably being masked by the huge amounts or malt in the aroma.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and very smooth. Slightly buttery on the tip of the tongue, becoming fuzzy in the back of the mouth. Lightly chewy.  Taste: No other beer tastes quite like Arrogant Bastard. Thick sweet malts, sharp dark fruits, raisins, and light caramel hit the tongue first. Underneath was a bready malt component and a husky, almost astringent, quality. Then on the finish, the hops rose up big and their dry, herbal bitterness dominated, though the malt was strong enough to still be present. There was a definite numbing effect from the alcohol, though its flavor was just barely detectable in the aftertaste.  I've had AB numerous times in the past, from bombers to 3-liter bottles to tap. This is the first time that I have gotten to sit infront of my computer, analyze it, and review it. It's a great beer that I will always seek out.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Derek,4.62,"I had this draft at Collin's, near Pioneer Square in Seattle.  Lots of depth to the flavour of this big brew.  Excellent bitter/sweet balance, spicey undertones, moderate-to-heavy mouthfeel.  Very drinkable... it takes time for your taste buds to decipher the complex flavours.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ommegangpbr,4.11,"Just about time for a revisit for this brew. This was one of the first beers I tried at the beginning of my beer advocacy and at the time this was too big a step for me to take in order for me to enjoy it. I do consider myself lucky for having stumbled upon this so early on in my sampling career as it makes for a good road marker of the evolution of my tastes. As to the bastard himself- there's no getting around the appearance of this beer. It's beautiful in the glass and the bottle is kick ass. It is very at home in my Chimay goblet as it looks very much like a dark Belgian brew; deep ruby color with a tan head that stays for a lengthy period of time. No lack of lacing to be found. Smells good. It's in a style that's so broad and varied that it's difficult to criticize it in that way so I'll just go with what my nose tells me. Floral, a little pungent, a little roasted, definately hoppy. This brew makes solid first impressions. The taste is somewhere between an ipa/barley wine and a stout/porter. Definately a fusion of styles going on here. Deep, dark, roasted to burnt flavors. It is a challenging flavor. The mouthfeel is right up my alley. There is softness there, as well as a reminder of espresso. I can definately drink more of this now than when I first started on my high quality beer path. Arrogant Bastard is necessary in ones beer resume... though I still think Bear Republic's Red Rocket ale is better.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,blackie,4.7,"Produces a quarter inch off white head when poured into the snifter. The initial head soon recedes, altough some bubble-fed atolls of carbonation remain. A simple swirl or two is all it takes to revive the head. A small amount of this carbonation clings to the sides of the glass as it is drained. The color of the beer is a very dark amber or mahogany color with quite an amount of red showing through.  The first thing I notice is not only the wonderful abundance floral hops, but how well they are balanced with that sweet, toasty malt. The odor progresses from more malt character to more bitterness over the course of a single sniff. Plenty of sweet fruit aromas linger in the background...including pineapple, plums, red bananas, and tropical fruits. The hop characteristic is great...pleasantly bitter and fragrant all at once.  This one is medium to medium high in carbonation. The bubbles of CO2 are small and delicate and do not impart the effervesence usually associated with this level of carbonation. The body is medium with a slight slickness.  The hops and the malt do their work on the tastebuds at the same time, but the hops are unquestionably at the forefront here. That is not to say that there isn't enought malt to counter the hops, however, because there is. In the background are flavors of tropical fruits. The hops behave somewhat strangely on the tongue. After the initial hop rush, they subside considerably...revealing more of the malty and fruity flavors present. Then, coming out of nowhere, the hops again make themselves known in the form of a very long and bitter finish with some toasted malt hiding way in the back. The long lasting hop bitterness eventually kicks the proverbial ass of everything else to become the last remnant of this formidable liquid.  An extremely complex beer. Resinous, piney hops abound on both the nose and palate...but with a nice malt characteristic as well. A must-try. I'm feeling a little loose after the entire bomber...though the alcohol is not otherwise evident. This one sat in the 55 degree F cellar for slightly over two months after I purchased it. If hops are as good a preservative as I think they are, I'd like to be embalmed with this stuff when I kick the bucket.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,JackTheRipper,4.5,"A: Poured into my new favorite glass (oversized wine glass) a dark brown with some amber highlights. Nice 1 inch head that gives way to a thin layer of clingy, sticky suds.  S: Sharp note of grapefruity hops just smacks me in the nose. Underneath the hops is an almost sweet smell of malt. Very nice.  T: Hop Bomb. Blissful bitterness. Nice taste of a bread crust flavor supporting the hops. Big bold flavor. No excuses. In your face attitude that I love dearly. As it warms a bit the hops seem to mellow a bit and let the other players join them on the stage, melding the flavors oh so nicely.  M: Sharp. Medium body with just above moderate carbonation. Alcohol is deliciously warming. Perfect after a day of frustration at work.  D&N: Almost makes me want to wax loquacious and write some back of the bottle stream of thought. This is just a damn fine beer, and far from scaring me, I've come to see the gargoyle as my guardian against the world of mediocre beers. Fire up the Ronnie James Dio CD, grab my D&D dice, and let's go slay the dwarves of average and their craptastic beer catapult of crud!

147,92,mmmbeer,4.42,"22 oz. with no freshness date - served slightly chilled in an oversized wine glass. Pours a nice ruby brown that kinda looks like red wine when light shines through. It's topped with a thin tan head that leaves minimal lacing, but I was swirling it constantly, thus removing any possible lacing. Smells very fruity - pineapple juice, tropical hops, and some sweetness and bitterness. Tastes like pineapple and mango with piney and citric hops (predominantly grapefruit) that are very bitter but complement the flavors nicely. It has low to medium carbonation with a smooth body that is oh so thick and feels wonderful. This is a great beer for the price and a great beer in general.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

What I did get was caramel/fruit punch aromas with very little hops. The taste was very sweet, also with the fruit punch and malts that ended up with the ever slight tangy-ness of hops. Slight alcohol presence in the end. The hops are there but not strong enough. The mouth feel was thick and creamy ( a high gravity) Overall Not a ""session beer"" but one to enjoy and move on.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The nose has is slightly hoppy with a phenolic twist (slightly band-aid). It's a good aroma, I like it. The taste is malty sweet with a generous hop bite. The hop addition is just right. Good mouthfeel. Full bodied beer with moderate carbonation. This is a good drinkable beer. I can't wait to get my hands on some more of this. I highly recommend.

147,92,tomthumbsblues,4.7,"I have eyed this beer for a while and almost bought it once, but finally decided to give it a try. I definitely wasn't let down. This Arrogant Bastard appeared as a three-finger tannish foamy headed beast atop a deep rich reddish brown beer. Aromas of hops--earthy and grassy--were detected along with a hint of cinnamon, brown sugar or possibly maple syrup. A caramel smooth sort of taste yields to quality savory hopping in the aftertaste. This was a smooth and balanced beer. The best I've had in a while.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,RenoZymurgist,4.03,"Poured a beautiful clear crimson brew with brown highlights and a sticky tan head that was very thick and left nice belgian lace on the pint glass. The aroma is of a nice mild yet spicy hop aroma which has tinges of pine but not much. The flavor is very nice as it begins with a smooth rich malty flavor that is a touch toasted but more carmelized which segues into a delcious hop flavor that combines the spiciness of the aroma hops with the grapefruity, sharp bitterness of high alpha hops and finshes in a lingering bitterness. Smooth bodied this beer is a pleasure to drink and the rich mouthfeel complements the hops but the high alcohol is hidden quite well until you stand up.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,chrisms86,3.9,"I had high expectations for this beer after hearing so much about it from other beer drinkers. Had a pleasant malty flavor. Added hops make me think that this beer is what would happen if one mixed the spices of an IPA with a syrupy stout. The 7.2% alcohol goes unnoticed in the taste.  My complaint with this beer was its mouthfeel. I liked the thickness, but it was too the syrupy nature of this brew is not a positive attribute.

Not too sweet like some chocolate type beers just a nice bitter hop and an added bitterness from the burnt malts.  Notes: Once again another winner from Stone Brewing. I get the sense that they trial run beers for years because when they release a beer it is refined. Winner. Very complex offering with a nice malt depth alongside bigtime overhopping.

I was surprised by the smell, I really think it resembles rebarber pie. A sweet sugary vegetable odour. The taste is (luckily) less overpowering than the Stone IPA. It does have some similar elements. The taste of the used hops for example. It has a very strong dry caramel malt experience. No trace at all of yeast, spices or fruits. Just the peculiar vegetal flavour. The aftertaste keeps a very strong hop bitterness and malt taste. That is preceded by a striking vegetable juice tone.

This tastes wonderful. First I notice a treacle/liquorice flavour and then a sweet berry rush fills my mouth and the carbonation seems to make it explode in slow motion before giving way to the treacle malt flavour and then leaving a subtle, but acrid liquorice infused hoppy aftertaste.

T: This ale starts off sweet and finishes with a wonderful bitter flavor of hops. Just before the bitterness hits, you can detect its alcohol on the palate. The initial flavor matches the aroma quite well, but that aftertaste was unexpected and definitely makes this beer. If you like hops, this is one of those must tries.  M: For such a bitter beer, it is very smooth.  D: Very drinkable, but be forewarned; its 7.2% alcohol could definitely turn you into an arrogant bastard, if overdone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Litterbean,4.5,"Gotta say, I love this beer. Have had it many, many times, and it always satisfies.  It pours a deep ruby red, with a tawny head that looks like it's sprinkled with cinnamon. Great head retention, it looks pillowy.  The smell is inviting and powerful. A blend of deep, warming sweetness with a twangy hoppiness that both intermingle and form an extreme yet balanced aroma.  Taste is rather malty at first, a sort of bready warmth to it. Some medicinal flavors in there, along with a noticeable alcohol heat to it. The hops are bitter and very abundant, but not in a way that it will offend you. If you are offended by this, you are not worthy, as the bottle states. Grapefruit is the most prominent flavor I can pick out, but there is also a good amount of sweet syrupy goodness. Other fruits and other sweets are also in there, but this brew is very complex and I'm sure this beer has different meanings for different people.  Good smooth mouthfeel, a bit of carbonation, and a whole lot of a punch for your tongue. Very easy to drink, despite the high alcohol. I'd love to sip this all day and get slowly buzzed. A real warmer but still refreshing on a hot day.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,NolanGTI,4.11,"UPDATE: I have now had this about 5 times since my original review and have found the beer to be much better than my initial review (which had a few 3.5's in it). Funny how a few more sittinggs with a beer and you can catch a lot more of it's subtleties.   Wow, I am really torn on this beer. I hadn't had it in awhile and at first I was in love, it looked so incredible coming out of the bomber, truly a work of art. More (sustainable) head than I was expecting and a great amber ale color.  The smell let me down some, I was waiting for something more than what I got here. It was just sort of flat, not a ton there. (edit: I should note that I think I drank this a t a bit colder temp than I should have which probably inhibited some of the aromatics of this beer)  My second letdown was the taste. This is a beer I really liked, but I think my expectations were a little out of whack based on the rep. I have a bit of trouble scoring this beer based on that initial reaction. All in all, this was a nice bold hoppy beer that did not bowl you over with alcohol taste or smell.  I classify this as a very good, but just short of great beer. I may need a few more bombers before I can say for sure, but I think this will be put into light rotation for me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,blitz134,4.28,"A very nice thick off white/light tan head which bloomed quite voracisouly upon pouring. A nice 1/4"" layer stuck around for the entire session and left the thickest lacing I have ever seen on any beer. Body was a transparent deep garnet red. I was gonna give a 4.5 for the appearance, but I'm really amazed at the lacing and head retention on this.  Smell has a fairly strong hop presence which includes a good deal of grapefruit. Also included was a good bit of caramel candy sweet malt backbone. Subtle hints of fresh fruits were also present including tangerine.  The taste is hard to define for me. It definately finishes well with a bitter hit of resin hops. There is a good spiciness from this as well. Malt plays a fairly prominant role with bready sweet nuances. This is a very balanced brew. Not as complex as I was expecting, but good overall. Somewhat of a mix between a west coast IPA and a good barleywine.  Mouthfeel is fairly full and coats the mouth well but doesn't linger for too long. A decent amount of carbonation leads to a nice crispness. Drinkability is very good with this one. Flavors are crafted together nicely and the alcohol level is low enough to where two bombers could be enjoyed at a reasonable pace without getting sloppy. A nice refreshing mouthfeel add to making this a highly drinkable beer.  More bottles will be coming home with me in the future.

147,92,BEERchitect,4.73,"I have always said it, Arrogant Bastard is the best invention in beer that has borne a true American Signature.  Malt!...Hops!....I might have given it back right then, right there if the bottle had not taunted be so. Bold aromas of caramelized malts, sweet dark fruits. Toasty and complcex. Waters the palate.  Deep mohogany in color. Ultimately clear. Dense tan head falls to about 1"" and remains. Very nice lacing. A thick pour with medium carbonation.  Imediate assault of an aggressive malt and hop blend. Sweet caramels, figs, dates, a bit of licorice, vanilla, cherries....and a kitchen sink. (it's all in there). Agressive hop flavoring quickly rounds out this full-to-thick bodied delight. Bittering is well within balance of the malt. Complex through the body and gaining through the finish with the higher detection of alcohol. Viscosity to the mouth is not as great as I had expected from the appearance. Finishes nicely, not too drying or tacky for a high gravity or high alcohol beer.  Bittering hops dominate and mask subtle sweetness left in the background. Flavors of those dark fruits linger for quite a while. Well attenuated, melanoiden laiden, yet creamy and full-magical!  The malt bill seems characteristic of a bold Dopplebock, yet hopped with a ton of Chinook- much like an Imperial IPA. A monster yeast gives a complex and rich fruit flavor. It's not a sipper, but we won't be doing keg-stands with this one either. A beer that has won my respect, regardless what the bottle might say.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,danielharper,4.31,"Purchased from Midtown Wine and Spirits, Nashville, TN.  I honestly didn't think I'd like this beer. Perhaps I was swayed by the ad copy on the back of the bottle, but I was thinking that this would be a super-hopped monster that I would personally find very disagreeable, as I am not a big fan of overhoppy beers. Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty hoppy brew, but it's not so far out of whack that it's intimidating; in fact, the hops and the fruit flavors actually work pretty well together. This beer deserves its high ranking among beer advocates, and now I only wish I'd bought a couple more of these when I went up to Nashville a couple of weeks ago.  Appearance is, for me, the best part of this beer. Forget the fantastic printed bottle, forget the clever ad copy on the back that informs the potential buyer of how intense this beer is, and just give this beer a nice solid pour into a pint glass. Pours a deep, deep, red color and forms a fantastically creamy head that sticks around for the entire length of the beer, even when topping off the glass from the bottle. Looks almost like a ruby stout, it's so thick and dark -- I was totally impressed by the appearance of this beer, so give it one of my very-rare fives.  Smell is very nice, with a hop character that is very present, and beneath it a nice fruity ester. It made me think of a very bitter apple juice, actually, but I mean it in the best way possible. I didn't get a lot more complexities off the nose, but it was a very nice beer to sniff and I enjoyed it a lot.  Taste is very similar to the nose -- I didn't get any suprises here. Again, reminded me of a very, very bitter apple juice, pleasant as far as it goes, but nothing that knocked my socks off. The beer tasted good and finished clean, leaving little aftertaste, so I'm giving it high marks -- very pleasant.  The mouthfeel was a very nice thing about this beer, as the one real shock I had in store was just how thick this thing was. The beer coated my tongue admirably, swishing it around in my mouth made me realize that the last word I'd use to describe this beer was ""watery""; this beer almost felt like syrup going down. Still, it was a cleansing kind of thickness, and left virtually no residue behind. Again, made me think of a nice stout in terms of consistency.  Good high score on drinkability. The clean finish and good taste make it a very easy-drinking beer, but I can't imagine finishing off more than one 22oz bottle of this beer, and probably couldn't even do one if it was very hot outside at that particular moment. Drinkable, enjoyable, but I'm going to stop at just one, thanks.  Next time I'm in Tennessee I'm absolutely going to buy a few bottles of this to keep on-hand. Too expensive to really drink everyday, but it's a nice beer to have for when it's needed. Until I can lay my hands on it again, I guess I'll get buy on Rogue American Amber.  EDIT 06-18-2005  I bought another bottle of this in Fayetteville, and upon another tasting, I've decided to up my ""taste"" rating from a 4 to a 4.5. Really fantastic taste, nicely balanced between hoppiness and sweet tartness. I only wish this stuff didn't cost six dollars a bottle, and I didn't have to drive forty-five minutes to get it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,TheLongBeachBum,4.5,"Sampling an ABA tonight and surfing BA.com before I hit the sack, my mind wandered and I got to thinking what my original Review made of this monstrous brew when I tried it some 3+ years ago..oh-oh, where is it, Im utterly shocked and I simply cannot believe that I have never reviewed this brew, or at least if I did it got deleted LOL!!!  Others come and go, but Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale is *the* one and only staple brew that always has had a place in my fridge since I moved to the USA in September 2001.  The demonic gargoyle looks as good now as it did the first time I did a double-take when I clapped eyes on the Bomber three years ago. The screen printed bottle will stand the test of time for sure, and it is no understatement to say that the iconic design of the Arrogant Bastard Ale bottle is to the modern day craft beer scene what Warhols Campbells Soup tin was to Pop Art.  Its all been written before, by those who can wax lyrical and are a lot more eloquent & knowledgeable about beer than I, so I wont even attempt to add anything differential to the staggering amount of nearly 600 Reviews already written.  After you try this, and move onto bigger brews, and of course clash swords with its copy-cat followers, it is all too easy to forget what a simply marvelous big-ass raw & complex, yet balanced & refined, brew this really is.  Not a perfect 5, but no complaints here and pretty much a perfect brew for me, well actually, I would add that it is only improved IMVHO when Oak-Aged and dispensed from the Cask I feel.

147,92,necoadam,4.03,"Poured out a dark ruby/brownish color with a good looking head. Left some lacing on the glass, but not that much. Smell was mostly hops, with a faint aroma of malts and a touch of barley. Taste was almost like the smell, but the malts made more of a difference. Hops explode on the palate at first with a heavy dose of malts and barley coming in the middle and balancing out everything. Hops linger in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was full bodied with a creamy texture, but the hops really linger for a long time. Not for the weak, that's for sure.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,TongoRad,4.28,"Pours a saturated dark copper color with a tall, finely bubbled tan head. This beer's appearance holds the promise of richness.  Aroma is a nice balance of dark caramel, spicy/citrusy hops and some fruit (hints of fresh fig and blackberry), though ultimately the caramel rules all. Underneath it all is a suggestion of alcohol. Overall it could be more potent, though.  This beer tastes great- lots of potential for cloying here but there is a significant bitterness and alcohol presence to save it. Those qualities from the aroma are here as well- the caramel comes out early but the fruit creeps in at the end and lingers with the very long hoppy finish. Very well put together.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,karst,4.97,"Breaking into this style for the first time I checked and found it is a ""Catch all style category for beers from 7.0 percent alcohol by volume and above"" As I worked my way to the bottom of this beauty it felt like 7.2 % ABV but far from the high end of the style's range of 25% abv.  American Strong Ale is said to have similarities to Barley-wines and Old Ales (recent discussion comparing these 2 separate styles rages on the forum while I enjoy this badboy) I searched my back issues of Zymurgy looking for a recipe from the brewers - No doubt a White Lab 007 yeast and Chinook hops in ~70 IBU dose - a little less than Ruination IPA(100+IBUs). But the grains that support such a hop dominate brew were what I was looking for. (# 11.5 pounds pale two-row malt and # 1.5 pounds crystal 120 according to a recipe provided by my friendly local Beerguide) - thanks MJR  Alcoholic taste comming to the front after the taste buds throw in the towel (after the first pint) and the carbonation reduces. Keeps a medium mouthfeel till the end and although finish is dry the bitter Cascade hops give a good aftertaste inviting you back for more. So yummy that I may have 2 bottles tucked into my coffin. So hoppy and still drinkable! Hummm . . . wonder how it would work as imbalming fluid. Maybe a little note tied to the bomber saying: ""Here's to ME and more of Stone's Good Stuff"" Carpe Diem!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,HogHill,4,"Appearance: A deep darkcopper with ruby highlights, the small tan head quickly faded to lace.  Smell: a lively west coast hop aroma backed with some sweet malt.  Taste: A caramelized malt flavor is primary here, with a big hoppy bitterness on the finish. I would gues this has over 50 IBUs. I think this could be characterized as a double IPA without too many complaints.  Mouthfeel: Kind of juicy and cloying, but the carbonation does a good job of wiping that out.  Drinkability: At 7.2 % it can be challenging to drain a 22. But it is very enjoyable beer to drink all the way to the bottom of the bomber.

It looked so pretty, I almost didn't want to ruin it by drinking it.  The smell was just as robust as the taste. Overwhelmingly malty, but not as hoppy as I expected after reading these reviews.  The taste was like an explosion. I first felt the power of the alcohol and the malt. After letting it sit in my mouth, the hops started to take over, that left a residue in my throat for a few minutes. A very complex beer, but very tasty.  Much more drinkable than one would think for a beer that has a warning that it is not for the faint of heart.

Pours from a nice bomber with into a chalice- That color is truly beautiful; brownish, reddish, almost tawny port like, with an off- white head. The smell has a coarse citrus background with clear bready/ malty/ grainy smells in there as well... nice. Taste is good; has a nice roast/ toast malt background, with a firm bitterness back there to smack you around; A little harsh, but I'm not sure if that's the hops or the alcohol. Feels smooth in the mouth, and tingles going down almost to the point of a burn that sticks around a bit. Nice complex aftertaste. It would be real easy to pop more than one of these guys open. Not sure it's an everyday beer for me, but damn tasty.  Overall, very interesting and complex. Definitely aggressive and a little unrefined, though. Lacks the smoothness of some other of my favorite ales, but I think that's part of the draw here. On the 'must try' list.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Appearance- Opened to be greeted by a volcanic erruption of beer all over my counter, sink and floor. Damn glad I didn't open in over the carpet. Probably lost a good 4oz or so of quality brew :( Pours a very red-copper color with a large bubbled head which disapates fairly quick. About average lacing.  Smell- Very hoppy with a dark caramel malt scent as well.  Taste- Gee, what a suprise....hops, in a Stone brew? I never expected that! This one is both hoppy and malty at the same time. Like drinking a barleywine with lots of hops, then tasting a sweet caramel on the finish. Very woody flavored hops. A bit of citrus, but mainly pine.  Mouthfeel- More carbonation than expected. Took a while to finish the whole thing. Fairly heavy mouthfeel as well. Very mouthcoating.  Drinkability- Was excited to try this brew for the first time and it held up pretty much to my expectation. I was expecting a bit more of a ""spiritual awakening"" from it, but, nonetheless, it still is an excellent brew that I'm sure I will be having again in the future.

147,92,bceaglejoe,3.75,"Presentation: This beer poured a very dark amber color into a traditional pint glass. There was about a finger-thick head that had reasonably good retention. It looked moderately carbonated. A floral hop aroma was the most prevalent scent on the nose. It wasn't overpowering, however. There were slight hints of malts in the nose as well.  Tasting: As expected, the hops were very strong on the tongue. The bitterness was not unpleasant, however, because the taste was balanced with some malt sweetness. Ester characteristics came across. This was a medium to heavy-bodied beer with slight tinges of alcohol on the tongue. This is a little harder to drink in succession due to the higher alcohol content.  Overall, this was an enjoyable beer, and I would pair it with heartier foods.

Smell: For a relatively old sample (bought ~10 months ago), the smell was quite fresh. Sugary and resinous hop aromas made me think of a cross between a Barleywine and a Scotch ale.  Taste: It came down like an easy drinking Barleywine, too, having the complexities I like, but with restrained cloyness and not too boozy, which gives this Beer extra drinkability points from me. It's malty, chewy and has a light, almost crack caramel flavor. The aftertaste is an interesting amalgam of sensations on my tongue; it's candi sweet on the tip, the bitterness bites you on the sides and on the gums, and the back is bone dry. Nothing takes command, nothing overpowers, no nerve endings get scrambled. I've scarcely encountered an american Beer over 7% with this much balance.

Taste-A big bold beer containing citrus and hoppy overtones along with a milder taste of carmel and coffee hinting the balance of hops and malt.

Woody notes, and the cocoa, and vanilla notes. Very complex, with a fickle and variegated smell, very inviting. At the taste, a shot of hop, more resolute than in the nose. Very malty, with woody notes, cocoa, liquorice, rhubarb. Good! Smooth. Fruity again (plum), and vanilla.

Sure it is hoppy with lots of course rough hops that give way to a little fruityness and while I like the hop combo the much bragged about malt complexity it two dimensional, sweet caramel meets grain. The alcohol gives it a good body and rounds out the flavor of the malt but sip after sip the malt complexity is just not there and since they brag about it, points are shaven off the taste.

It's like the fruit bowl decided to have a party in my mouth, but then the hops show up and say: ""Okay, everybody go home!""  There's a lot of sweet malty flavor up front with notes of five or six different fruits that I'm probably imagining most of. Tastes great.

Sporadic light tan head holds for awhile. Decent lacing along the sides. Aroma is very bitter and sharp. Quite acidic as well. There's some alcohol notes in there too, which I liked. The flavors in this beer simply did not work together. A very sweet caramel/butterscotch taste comes at first but then is soon drowned out by an intensely bitter, slightly piney hoppiness. The hoppiness holds and brings some alcohol fusels in with it and then on the finish the malt comes back with a sickening cloying syrup texture. The finish is horrible. I feel like I need to wash my mouth out with water. This beer is on the thin side and the body can't hold the flavors together. It seems like Stone just threw a bunch of random ingredients into the kettle and this was the horrible result.

I taste the hops along with sweet caramel, brown sugar.  For me, this is very drinkable and could take me through a session although I don't think I'd be able to stand up or see straight after only a few.

The taste is very complex...bitter sweet, caramel, earthy and floral hops, a touch fruity, with a piney and bitter aftertaste.

Strong aromatics - hops, esters, permanent markers and lots of nose stinging alcohol. The hops are earthy and piney - similar to sticking a pine branch and needles up your muzzle.  The taste is a punch in the mouth. There are oodles of malts and a slew of hops. Trying to balance these monsters must be a tough job but those arrogant pricks did it! Sweet, sticky and downright bitter as hell.

A solid, thick head sits on top and disappears at a good rate, leaving bits of lace and foam along the edges.  A very earthy, evergreen smell. Also, some straw smell. Damp straw, even because there is a slightly sweet smell.  Taking it in and holding it, you get the caramel of the malt, very unique and different than most of the malts I've tasted. In the back of the mouth and as you swallow, the hops come out and you get a bite. My first few swallows, the hops were definitely evident, no way to miss them. About half way through, they mellow out (or I'm mellowing out with the alcohol content). A bit of a smoky flavor, like a burnt marshmallow but not as sweet.  This beer will make you cough if you aren't careful when sifting out the flavors. It feels good on the tongue but the bite of the hops and the carbonation get to you after a bit.

147,92,DrJay,4.45,"Clear chestnut red/brown colour topped by a dense tan head. Thick lace was left on the sides of the glass and the head retention was excellent. Very nice to look at. Great combination of malts and hops in the aroma. Hops consist of a raw grassy smell and a light floral aroma. Caramel and toffee come through fairly strong, and there's some very nice ripe fruit in there as well as very light alcohol.  There's a big malt flavour that starts it off closely followed by a pine resin bitterness that lasts all the way into the long, bitter finish. As it warms, the malt becomes more pronounced, with a hint of chocolate showing up. This really helps the flavours mellow and balance very well. Remarkably well balanced, actually. Very full body with moderate carbonation. Bubbles were on the small side and added some smoothness to the slightly creamy texture. Slightly drying at the finish with a bit of alcohol warming.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer. The strong flavours and aromas make it quite distinctive, while the craftsmanship keeps it very balanced and sinfully easy to drink.

My last attempt met with failure when Vintage Cellar was temporarily out of stock, but here it is today. 24 ounce bottle with the devil on the front and a lot of talk on the back...  I love the cranberry red color of this beer. The cappucino head was not something I expected (I would have guessed white or off-white) and didn't stick around too long. Smells much sweeter than it tastes; the hops cut the sweetness just enough. A little hop bitterness and a little alcohol warmth. Almost a vodka-like quality when I swallow (not so much the alcohol but the flavors). Fills the mouth with just enough body but not overly much.  I'm not sure this beer lives up to the hype on the bottle, though.

Smell: Crisp, clean, smokey, pine and orange.  Mouthfeel: The smallest sip (full)fills your mouth. Nice follow thorough from front to back.

The bitterness is lingering and stays with the pallate for some time. The alcohol makes sure its presence known towards the end. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, great for the style.

Served a bit too chilled, so not all of the flavors were emanating form the pint...mostly sweet malt and a subtle aroma of fruity hops coming out. I have come to realize that AB combines all of the qualities that I have learned to appreciate over the years....a nice burst of sweet maltiness up front, with a nice blend of fruity hops with no real sense of the alcohol present. Finish is bitter, but does not linger on the pallet. The mouthfeel is not thick, but is by no means thin...the perfect carbonation makes this brew totally drinkable for its style.

147,92,Joey7F,4.43,"Arrogant Bastard Ale is one of those beers that you hear about and if you are lucky enough to not live in Tampa Florida, you can buy it at your local liquor store.  Fortunately my friend from Colorado brought 6 for me. I paid a premium for it, it was worth it because having 6 large containers of liquid surrounding a video card with a few usb cables hanging off scares the NSTB people...he practically had to drink the beer to prove that it was not dangerous.)  The head on this beer lasts forever, and pours a dark orange (thing of beauty) It has a strong smell, but you can only really smell it when you are on top of it. It tastes like an ESB and it is good chilled, it is fantastic at room temperature. The mouthfeel is like that of a good stout and the drinkability is good, but at 7.2% abv you probably won't want too many.  --Joey",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,whartontallboy,4.45,"Huge frothy head crowns a nice brown pour and leaves lace all over my snifter. Smell is hoppy and alcoholic with some malt straining to sneak through. The taste is hoptacular, but it's balanced well by a malty sweetness and candied fruit taste. The sweetness hides the alcohol pretty well, and then a nice hop and caramel interplay starts on your tongue. Quite entertaining. I'd label this one as medium-to-full bodied, and the complexities really shine through as it warms up a bit. Not just a clever bit of marketing, this one kicks ass, like all the other Stone brews I've had.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,dgallina,4.55,"Pours a clear ruby with a mammoth and rocky off-white head. Leaves a foamy layer and very solid lacing on the sides of the glass. Smells thickly and sweetly malty, with strong piney hops and an undercurrent of grapefruits and slight banana-like tropical fruits. Smooth and quite creamy, with powerful and chewy resin-like pine flavors. The initial hop kick is followed-up with chunky sweet caramel malts, which are interwoven with the hop flavors through the drink. Chewy, smooth, and very satisfyingly creamy in the mouth. A really good American-style strong ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Knuckles,2.08,"I just don't get the accolades this beer gets. This beer is, to me, a very simple but oddly discordant brew. So at the risk of getting flamed, here goes.  Appearance: The color, initially, is attractive. I was able to pour a nice head with little effort, and it's a fairly deep ruby, and not unappealing.  Smell: Fairly malty, but in a cloyingly sweet kind of way. Then, in the finish, there's this weird whiff of hops that really doesn't seem to belong. What in the hell is going on with this beer?  Taste: Malty at the start and in the middle, but not in a way I would view favorably. Almost a brown sugar (dark corn syrup?) kind of sweetness to it, that then has this complete non-sequiteur of a hop finish. Don't get me wrong, I love hops (and when used wisely in an stronger beer, they can be impressive as hell: Pike XXX Stout, for example), but these just don't belong. Are they the wrong type, or just work poorly with the malts? I don't know.  Mouthfeel: Initially, upon seeing the color, I thought this would be a warm, velvety presence in my mouth. Disappointingly enough, it wasn't. Very thin, and just not what I expected.  Drinkability: This beer is comprised of individual elements that simply do not work with each other. The aroma doesn't work with the taste, the malts don't work with the hops, the taste doesn't work with the mouthfeel. What I found, in this tasting, is that the colder the beer is served, the more coherent it is. As you allow it to warm to proper temperatures, the various elements seperate themselves from each other and become even more discordant. Damn thing can't even warm up right.  I've now had this twice in my life (Christmas of 1997, right after it came out, and just now). Both times my impressions were the same, so I won't be having it again. Arrogance is a great marketing tool, I just wish they had a beer that was worth being arrogant about.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,allengarvin,4.25,"Appearance: Dark, ruby-tinted brown. Impressive head of yellowish foam.  Smell: Rich, toasted malt and a huge hop aroma.  Taste: Very toasted, nutty malt with a bouquet of hop flavors that alternatively remind me of grapefruit, dried pine needles, lemongrass and peppery basil. Finishes lingeringly with a bitter dryness.  Body: Crisp, surprisingly light mouthfeel.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Shultzerdugen,4.53,"Poured a very dark jewel like amber with tan and rowdy head.  The first thing I got from this beer was big piney hops, followed quickly by sweet grains and alcohol.  The hops with this beer are massive, high alpha oil tough guys, but they fit quite nicely with the huge malts and ABV. Great caramel flavor.  Good C02, slick and dry finish.  A beer to be reckoned with. I'll usually take a dare, and dares are rarely this pleasurable. Thanks to karst for the treat. Yee-oww!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,IrishMike,4.02,"'Tis a shame, living in Jersey; no bottle of Stone can be found at any store within this state. Ah well, thanks to the wonderful resource of the online trading forum, i was able to grab a nice 22oz bomber of this. Many thanks to mntlover for the help!  Appearance- Pours a deep copper with a healthy, but not excessive, amount of carbonation rising up from the bottom of the glass. 1"" off-white head with excellent retention and small sparkles of lacing all about. Barley-wine esque, with better retention and more carbonation.  Smell- Very nice, i'm a big fan of caramel and this seems to slap on plenty of it. Nice hops round out the nose as well; background floral notes fight, but eventually give up, a losing battle with the strong malt character. Tiny roasted character hiding in there somewhere.  Taste- Ever feel like you've just been slapped after taking a sip of beer? This is only the second time this strange feeling has occured with me, and the other time was with the wayyy wild Old Crusty. Sweet upfront, excellent caramel/toffee/nutty taste that seems to be relatively mild and even ""normal"". The beer then makes you apologize for ever thinking it was normal for even a second. Hops come in, citrusy/grapefruity, but they are still nice and somewhat subdued. After-taste is a solid slap to your jaw. Pure brutality. I love it. I read other reviews stating that this beer lacks a certain balance, and it's true. But it's polarizing in that sense; a love it or hate it taste if i've ever seen one. I happen to be one of the people that really liked it.  Mouthfeel- Thanks to the brutual bitterness that comes from this brew, the taste will stay in your mouth for a LONG time. That's not a bad thing at all (consdering it tastes great), except after drinking a large amount of it the after-taste does seem to wear you down a little. Very thick and oily.  Drinkability- i could THEORETICALLY see how someone could make this a session brew, but it just isn't my type. Beats me up too badly. Grab a glass here and there, though, and i'll be a happy man. Great taste, just a bit too rugged to be making a frequent trip to.  I read the back label, and Stone made it a point to say that ""i probably wouldn't like this beer"". Well, i loved it, but i can see how the average macro drinker (the same macros that advertise ""say goodbye to aftertaste"" these days) would hate this brew with a wild passion. Strong, brutal, and arrogant. What a nice way to start off my experience with Stone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,rousee,4.13,Caramel brown with a lush thick 4mm head that holds extremely well. A good tiny-bubbled lace is left on sides of glass. Malty-earthy smell--fairly non-descript--does have some buttery elements not diacetyl-ish though. The taste is a full-on malt assault and quite lovely. Has nuttiness of cashews or hazelnuts. There is little to no bitterness but it does finish slightly too syrupy and sticky. The mouthfeel is fuzzy and syruppy but still quite pleasant. AB on tap is too damn drinkable (7.2abv) --very smooth but maybe a little too sticky--so have water with it. Much better on-tap than in the bottle.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jed,4.55,"Presentation: Comes in a brown, 22 oz bomber with the infamous Stone gargoyle on the front, and a hilarious blurb questioning one's right to consume the beer on the back. No freshness date. Poured into an imperial pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a dark, rich chestnut brown  almost amber. Uniform, opaque color throughout the glass. One finger's worth of head w/okay retention. As the head disappears, it leaves behind tons of lacing, uniformly coating the sides of the glass.  Smell: An excellent blend of citrus, hoppy aromas contrasting sweet, caramel malt. Also a hint of light fruit in the aroma.  Taste: A wallop of initial hop bitterness gives way to sweet, malty flavors  almost buttery caramel, and more fruit sweetness. I realize it's the yeast and the malt, but I swear that there's a hint of pineapple in this beer. Throughout the pint, regardless of the dominant flavor, the hops provide an underlying dry bitterness. Finish is dry, with lingering hop flavors and a touch of sweetness. This is one balanced bastard of a beer.  Mouthfeel: Solid mouthfeel, could be a bit smoother but still strong.  Drinkability: I really want to say that this would be a great session beer, but the 7.2% alcohol suggest otherwise. Still, it's rare to find a beer boasting both strong flavor and strong drinkability.  I approached this beer, my first Stone, with trepidation: the cult of the bastard is strong on Beer Advocate. Happily, this is one beer that easily leaves up to the hype. The hops are well balanced by the malt, resulting in a beer that's accessible while packing a huge flavor. We're not worthy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,beersarang,3.33,"Hilarious bottle. Love Stone.  Pours a beautiful amber with a voluminous tan head.  Smell is of floral citrucy American hops and lightly toasted malts.  Taste, now I love Ruination, so I'm not afraid of hops. I felt that this beer was out of balance. The malt is strong, alcohol character is strong, and hop character is way strong. ""This is an agressive beer."" but not well put together. Something feels a little wrong with this, the aftertaste is rather intense and mildly unpleasant. I guess I'm just a little dissapointed with the ""flagship"" beer of stone. All around a good beer, but get the ruination instead.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriate carbonation.  Not particularly drinkable because of the harshness and the ""off balanced-ness""",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,mynie,4.48,"Wonderful bottle. The little gargoyle man is holding up his stein with a smug look on his face like the guys I hated in high school. Fuck this, I&#8217;m being challenged. The back of the bottle contains a hilarious little spiel about how I will hate this beer because I am not sophisticated enough for it.  Pours beautiful. Dark red mixing with ruby hues and a perfect, two finger head. The head lasts too. Wonderful.  Smells of deep hops, varied from floral to zippy, with a distinct zing of alcohol in the mix.  Great balance. Wonderful. Floral and fruity hops up front, followed with a glimpse of alcohol, followed by a great balancing of malt sweetness, and finished up by a dull, lasting bitterness. It&#8217;s like getting burned, but in a good way: intense feeling, cessation, a disoriented clam, and then a lingering reminder of the beginning. This is an incredibly complex mix of intense feelings. Very nice.  Not nearly as hoppy as I had thought it would be. But this is a different beer, a better balanced beer, and truly a beer that everybody should try.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Pours a deep copper color with a fluffy off-white head. Some caramel malt sweetness mixed with a tree bark-like earthiness with a lot of piney and citrusy hops in the aroma. Malty and hoppy, balanced rather nicely. The hopping is piney and aggressive and the malt comes across as caramelly, biscuity and a little sweet at times. I wonder how many times this beer has just bitch-slapped some die-hard SNPale Ale drinker in the face.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Sycodrummer,4.38,"Poured from the 22oz. bomber into a 12 oz. toulip glass. Formed a dark brown color with a think and frothy 2 finger head and slight translucence. Color fades a bit to a ruby red when the light gets at it. Decent lacing lined the glass for the entire length of the sample.  Smell is slightly floral and malty. A faint smell of alcohol is present but not enough to let on to its 7.2% ABV.  Taste is quite good. A sharp maltiness to it that finishes nice and crisply. Rather bitter but well balanced so as not to overpower the taste. Rather complex with a lot of flavors mixed but also balanced well. The alcohol kicks in when swallowed and packs a punch. Not over-poweringly alcoholic but a definite punch to let you know its there. A very slight imperial stout character taste to it.  Moderate mouth feel. With slight carbonation coming thru when left for a moment on the palate.  Very drinkable though not something I would have with the main course. Great to have before as an aperitif of sorts. 12oz sampling would be perfect size before a meal. More than that in one continous sitting and the ABV and ""arrogant"" taste of this beer will takes its toll.  All in all: very well done. I will be having it again soon.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Troyone,4.5,"Poured with a two inch head with staying capacity and some lacing, the color is a dark tea with an orange hue, and the carbonation action is moderate. The smell is a slightly nutty caramel malt; herbal pine, and lime hops; and hints of bubble gum and licorice. The taste is a heavy sweet bitter with a slightly burnt, nutty, and caramel malt; the herbal pine hops has a finish of grapefruit and lime; and this has hints of bubble gum, butter, vanilla, and licorice in the background. The mouthfeel has a light to medium feel, a dry minimally syrupy texture, and soft almost flat lively carbonation.

Smells hoppy, herbal, and piney, almost like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but more piney. Tastes strong--piney, bitter, hoppy, alcohol, and goodness. Has a medium-bodied mouthfeel.  Can't say too much about this beer--everything's been said. A kick-ass beer to say the least.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Appearance: Color is reminiscent of dark amber maple syrup with red legs if held up to the light. Abundant creamy head that lasts a long while, leaving impressive lace behind.  Smell: Pungent citric hops aroma coupled with fruity alcohol esters and scotch-like malt sweetness. Like the Double Bastard, this combination brings pineapples to mind.  Taste: Very complex. Massive piney hop bitterness mingled with dark malts bringing a wide array of flavors to the party. Orange peel and dark fruit seem to dominate, but this brew's all over the place. There is a touch of alcohol and perhaps a faint smokiness near the finish. Bitter hop resins linger on the the lips.  Mouthfeel: Velvety in texture with medium carbonation. Luxurious.  Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable to those who appreciate it, and I certainly do.

Nice powerful smell. Hoppy characters dominate - plenty of citrous and pine, yet balanced with floral qualities. Some caramel and a dose of alcohol in the nose as well. Taste is oh-so-bold! Aggressive hop profile gives your tongue the boot, but is delicately balanced by sweet caramel and some smooth malt. Full mouthfeel leaves you satisfied. Finish is citrous and sweet at the same time, backed by warming alcohol. Cheers to Stone for quite the ale!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Beer has a malty sweet taste to it with hints of toffee and roasted grains. The malt is balanced with a citrisy hop flavor, and there is a hint of detectable alcohol. Nice thick bodied mouthfeel, a drinkable beer but not something you'd want to have all night long.  If you don't like this beer, you are not worthy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

A little pine smell is in the mix too. The taste is big on malts and hops. Very complex. Caramel malty sweetness is balanced by citrusy hops taste. Hop flavor lingers of the tongue long after a sip is finished. Arrogant Bastard's taste smooths out even more after it has warmed up a little. There is so much going on here it is hard to describe, but one thing is certain this is a world class beer. However, if you don't like west coast hopped beers, you probably won't like this.

The aroma is full of intense hopiness, lots of floral hops. Seems to be just a hint of rubber or plastic in the nose.  The taste is also intensely hoppy with just an underlying malt sweetness. Just a bit of dark fruits but lots of piney hops. A little more malts would be nice to balance out the hops...maybe i am just not worthy! Again the finish is...hops, hops, hops!

I could smell the hops when I opened the bottle. It reminded me of opening a sealed package of hop flowers at brew time. It poured a reddish brown color, with a perfect tan head. The head held till the end. Lacing means nothing to me, but if it did, this beer would be the definition of 'nice lacing'. This beer tastes great. It goes in smooth, and finishes with a dramatic hop bite. I sampled it at about 58°, and it popped. I think I will call that aunt, and tell her I love her.

147,92,DFN,3.65,"Arrogant Bastard pours a nice coppery red in color, somewhere between the color of iced tea and Coca-Cola. The head is thick and creamy, tan in color, and lasts a long time.  Overall, the taste is nicely balanced, although more on the hoppy/bitter side than the malty side. Since I prefer a less-bitter brew, this is not a strong point for me. Mouthfeel is good, but there's a ""puckery"" quality to the beer that I do not find appealing. Overall, I'd rate this about 3.7 because I can tell it's a quality brew, but I won't buy it for myself again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The aroma was deeply malty with dark caramel and citrusy grapefruit aromas. The fruity aromas also contained some complexity of dark fruits.  The flavor was more even that anticipated. (This was most likely a somewhat aged bottle). The maltiness and caramel came with a nice hop backbone but not as assertive as with a fresher bottle. The grapefruit and citrusy flavors and bittering were well aged and interestingly complex.  The finish was not quite dry with a nice caramel impression lasting long into the aftertaste.

The aroma was fairly malty, with a good hops edge to it. The taste, however, was much heavier on the hops than the maltiness, but both were present in good proportion. The result was fairly hoppy, but nothing like the typical highly-hopped-so-it's-almost-an-IPA we've all grown used to. The result is fairly smooth, with a nice touch of sweetness to round out the flavor. Very nice, and very drinkable---I'd probably drink more of this if I could actually get it easily in my area.

147,92,neonbrown82,4.87,"Wow! I could swear that every time I picked up my class for a sniff or a drink, I was drinking a different brew. The first sips were quite hoppy, though not overbearing. The next few drinks contained caramel and toffee, and the next few drinks after that contained orange and other fruity tastes. This is a very complex brew. It is a shame that the text on the label is true for the majority of beer drinkers, at least in the U.S. I particularly loved the following: ""Questions or comments? If you don't like this beer, keep it to yourself -- we don't want to hear from any sniverling yellow-beer-drinkin' wimps, 'cause this beer wasn't made for you.""  Anyways, back to the review... the beer poured a dark nutty brown color. The head wasn't nearly as impressive as the Stone IPA I sampled the previous night, though it seemed to leave at least a quarter inch of foam throughout the whole 22 ounces, so the beer was at least protected from the O2. The lacing was unlike any I'd ever witnessed, however. The smell, as I mentioned earlier, seemed to change from time to time, though it always kept a pleasant hoppy aroma.  The taste was so dynamic I couldn't not give it a 5, along with the complexities of the mouthfeel as the brew is swished to different parts of the palate. Although I wanted another one immediately after finishing, the drinkability isn't quite perfect for such a heavy and complex brew, but it is damn near. I only wish I didn't have to order Stone brews off the internet to enjoy them from home.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,watermelonman,4.15,"This poured to a great glowing dark red with a nice big head that lasted fairly well. The lacing looks good too.  In terms of flavor, this isn't one to disappoint.

Definitely nice when both flavors come through at once, when one doesnt linger longer or overpower the other. Very rich in flavor, complex but very drinkable nothing bland about this brew. A definite beer to have on hand for any occasion.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Dithyramb,4.03,"Had the big bomber bottle with the uniquely arrogant creature on the label. Paid just $5.99 for it in PA this last week. Has an interesting description on the back, with a definition of arrogance. No born on or freshness dating, but the top of my bottle top had 8 years on it. Pours a thick and cloudy dark brown with a dark tan head formed by slow rising carbonation. This would epitomize what my macro friends would call dark beer. Smells like a caramel covered pinecone. This is a chewy beverage. The initial rush of hop residue is subsidized with a thick caramel maltiness. Coats and smoothes as it flows down, finishing hoppy and sweet. The great flavor is held up with an excellent body and mouthfeel. I wouldnt have too many, but drinkable nonetheless.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BrewMaster,4.65,"Poured from the usual 22 oz bomber into an Arrogant Bastard flute-like glass. It has a nice creamy head that cascades beautifully down the sides. The color is a mild reddish amber with a very slight orange tint. The aroma on this beer is simply beautiful. Very sweet with an abundance of floral hoppiness and some earthy, pine scent from the hops as well. Very inviting. The flavor is splendid with a sweet hoppy bitterness from the start. It is very aggressive on the palate with the pine flavor of the hops leading the way. It is not offensive, but strong in a good way. The malt is very clean and crisp with notes of cherry, caramel and berries. The beer is very well hopped but it is not overdone. There is definately a great malt/hop balance that makes this beer splendid.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Globetrotter,4.17,"Sure wish the arrogance would stretch all the way to Moscow. Procured in Tennessee, shipped to Russia via air, opened on 12/8/04, my bomber looks and feels just like the picture - pure attitude. Label professes ingredients purely in conformance with the purity law. If there is freshness info here, I'm not smart enough to find it. Not worthy!  Pours a clear dark copper/pale brown under a 1.5 finger off-white head that fades fairly quickly to slightly chunky film leaving some OK lace. The nose is flowery hops, mollified slightly by some sweet grain. The mouth is very prickly and fairly heavy, with asyrupy consistency I'm not sure I like. Pretty complex taste profile, with plum and grain prominent early, followed by lots of truly aggressive hops, coming on flowery, then coniferous, drowning out the malt and burying the fruit. The finish comes on espresso bitter, completing the survey of hops flavors. I'd say the arrogance is justified.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

On the nose are the ever-present left coast hops, some fresh fruit to include grapefruit, these are sinus-cleansing aromas. The taste is more of an experience  thick and chewy off the cuff, rich and massively hopped up; caramel and licorice are noted up front. The citrus hop offerings come to life as she warms, just a touch dry, the body is very sweet and oh so smooth; the palate is cleansed by this massive brew! In addition, some sugary and cotton candy tastings left to graze the palate, add some raisin and oak flavorings  yeah youll find them all. Roasted malts and were hops mentioned?

147,92,HochFliegen,4.08,A nice redish brown color with a good tan creamy head. Smell was dominated by the spicy hoppness with a clean citrus or pine like scent in there as well. Nice carmel sweetness of the malts as well even some toast or bread like scent. The taste was full of malt flavor right off the bat. Then the hops hit and mellows the sweetness. Its sort of a rough transition when I first had the hop taste but it mellows and adds a degree of complexity to the beer that is amazing. This beer was very complex and full of flavor and body. Just hope I can find some more.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,garymuchow,3.93,"Jeez, I'm only the 490th review. It's about time I showed up. And that is only thanks to Gueuzedude who so kindly provided a sample for me. Thanks to a great BA. Aroma is a wonderfully spicy hoppiness with a shot of citrus and more grassiness. A bit of sweet malt and oxidation with a hint of alcohol. Pours clear amber of reds and brown. Large tan heaad that recedes slowly to form a rocky cap. Leaves lots of lacing and that cool line of foam after every drink. I served this a little warm which I think ended up being good. Hop intensity noted first and throughout the drink and a very long finish. The malt forms a base, but isn't all that flavorful. It improves in time with an ever increasing sweetness as it warms. This is pleasing. There is an oxidation taste that hints at sherry flavors. Really nice ale smoothness that helps buffer the sharpness of the hops bite. Adequate carbonation to create some fullness. Medium thickness. This is really quite good. I'm to sure why this isn't a double IPA. The slight oxidation seems to be the only thing that makes it a strong ale, but it really is slight. Nonetheless is deserves the accolades and the high BA ranking. A hop lovers delight. ""I'm not worthy."" As an addendum, the intensity of the hops seemed to have a negative effect on my well-being the next day. It's different than a ""hang-over"" from the alcohol. I've had it with other highly hopped beers before, but this one seemed the worst.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,KroMagnon,4.48,"The beer has a nice head, a rather unusual shade of yellow - almost like a butterfinger bar, and it looks particularly striking over the very dark shade of amber for the beer itself. The head lasts and subsides lightly. The aroma features a heavy dose of malt along with some caramel notes and a slightly cooked syrup note - strangely I had trouble detecting much in the way of esters or hops. But flavorwise, I get a great thick maltiness coupled with a huge hop flavor, and a great complexity with nuances of cherry, chocolate, and toffee blending with clear malt presence and sharp bitterness. Again, though, the beer surprises me because I don't get quite a strike of bitterness at the end - overall the flavor is much more balanced and the hops seem more for flavor than bitterness. Awesome!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,GreenWBush,3.94,"Hmm ... it appears that I do not have logged my original review for the Bastard, so I guess there's nothing to directly compare against. Alas:  Amber with tan creeping-vine lace. Settling quickly to wee carbonation with large, interspersed bubbles.  After a year or so this beer still reeks with malty-booze but the hop presence is clearly less at the forefront. The leafy, herbal qualities of the hops have quelled down to a harsh, weirdly scotch-like presence amongst the notably high prescence of alcohol. The citrus, grapefruit qualities are gone too, replaced not with any real rounded qualities except for a slight butteriness that was not there before.  This now seems kind of like a smaller, hoppier, strong ale. Slight metallic flavors abound, with no to little sweetness makes it lose points. Any bready or doughiness is burned off by that almost stale hop-kick.  Still, pretty smooth on the palate. Each sip gives you a nice little warm buzz in the stomach, and I could imagine how this on-tap would get really addictive. I'll stick with it fresh though, thanks.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,clvand0,3.82,"This beer is quite different out of the bottle than it is on tap, so I feel compelled to write about it again. Comes only in a 22oz bomber. It pours a dark amber color with a large white head that doesn't ever go away and leaves lots of pretty lacing on the glass. The aroma is very strong with the pine hops, but has a caramel malt backing it up. The flavor is much more 'arrogant' from the bottle than from the tap. Less smooth. Very aggressive hop flavor that masks most of the malts. It's still really good, but if you can get this on tap, try that version.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Maestro,3.58,"This beer is heavy. The head is quite thick and tan and stays for the whole pint. The beer is a dark red. Smell is fruity with lots of biscuit and toast. The beer is very malty. I would say that the hops are almost subdued, a nice change for a Stone Beer. There are hints of berries and slight dry wine characteristics. Mouthfeel is very chewy and a bit sticky. Drinkability, we'll just say pace yourself.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,trancefishy,4.3,"Pours a dark nutty brown colour, with a thinish off white head. Smells like toffee and nuts, hardly an hops in the nose. Taste is many things coming at you at once. Youve got caramel, fruitcake, and some oily hops. Quite the blast from the past. Good complexity. Balance is there, but its still very hoppy. The malt is a bit underrepresented, but, thats what this beer is all about. In your face action. Really lively taste, lots of busy flavours teeming about your palate to create some sort of bastardly tapestry. great mouthfeel. Good beer, no kidding.

Increadibly sweet upfront, honey, brown sugars and molasses followed by a rush of hoppy spice rolling over the tongue. Very complex and very well balanced brew. Aftertaste is lingering sweet then a hoppy sensation. Full body leaving some coating.

147,92,nogoodreason,4.5,"Clean, clear amber. No chill haze. Head is fine white, without much retention. Breath in, and your nose is filled with clean malty goodness and heavy raisin presence. Another inhalation brings piney, citric hops presence. Smells sweet and strong, with a gorgeous, ragged hop presence.  Medium bodied, with smooth light carbonation and a sweet caramel and raisin taste with some alcohol apparent. At first, the hop bitterness is subdued, keeping the pleasing brown ale-like maltiness at the forefront. As it goes, the hops become more intense, floral slightly, citric and piney. It gets harsher and more aggressive, finishing with an easy-going rasin and a lingering piney bitterness around the edges.

Big sweet malt flavors up front. Pineapple and candied fruit set against a caramelly background. Huge hops come in midway to balance out the sweetness. Pine resin with deliciously spicy notes. Finish is bitter, with lingering sweetness. Big, bold body; chewy feel. It might destroy my palate (even though I think Im worthy), but I dont care.

Its not a New Belgium LaFolie or a Southhampton Grand Cru, but man do I luv this stuff.  Mahogany brown with a white head. Aroma is malty, alcohol, citrus, hops, bubblegum.

As it is, this is a supreme brew, a just king, who wisely judges the imbibers from his throne...if thou art not worthy, tarry not 'round these vessels, seek a softer, sadder brew for you..let only those who can claim worthiness hoist a chalice of this finest ale! Got to be one of America's best barleywines, bar none!!! I could rant on some more, for the bottle is not yet finished, but let it be known, that this ale has powers over me, bewitches and bewilders, and all in the best sense, for I leave the normal earthly realm to visit sublimer planes, all courtesy of this bottle!

147,92,RedwoodGeorge,4.3,"I was almost afraid to try this brew - considering it's held in high esteem here on BA I figured it was likely to be a bitter hop monster. Thankfully my apprehensions were unfounded as this was a delightfully well balanced brew.  The beer pours a wonderful orange brown with a thick tan head. The head lasted for quite some time and left plenty of lacing along the glass.  The smell was very inviting - lots of warm malt notes, a sweet hint of alcohol and a subtle spicy note reminiscent of nutmeg. The taste was perfectly balanced - plenty of sweet malt notes to start and a very slow blooming hop aftertaste. After every sip I'd think ""gee, hardly any hops"" only to find ten seconds later a strong (though mellow) hop echo. There was a very pleasant nutty flavor that complimented this brew's brown ale heritage. The alcohol burn was a bit much and probably the only detraction from the taste but then again it is a 'strong ale' so that's to be expected. The taste was bold but far from overpowering and as complex and rewarding as any zinfandel.  Mouthfeel was fine though not outstanding. There was a pleasant overall smoothness to the brew that was quite enjoyable. Drinkability was very high - now that I've tasted this Arrogant Bastard I'm going to make sure there's always one in the back of my fridge waiting for a good friend who appreciates good beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Skidz,4.34,"Bottle obtained by my bro in a collaboration. Part 3 of the 4 part Stone tasting.  Pours out burnt sienna and sits dark orange-red in the glass with a large foamy tan head.  Smells of citrus fruit (grapefruit, orange), sweet malts lie underneath. Peppery and woody with a bark-like aroma. Hops cover everything. Very unique aroma. I said, ""summer strawberries in a hay field,"" while my brother said, ""Watermelon Bubblicious.""  Bitterness comes up strong on you, but sweet malts enter soon. Quite hoppy, nutty and very bitter. More sweet citrus fruits come out in the mouth along with a hint of caramel.  Clean with good carbonation; tickling but not overbearing.

The ""thing"" gives off some bitterness, yet it's almost bittersweet in smell.  Taste: This beer's slogan really says it all: ""You're not worthy."" That's really true. I didn't review this beer until I'd been drinking it for a long while, and I'm glad that I waited. It's not really sweet, but somehow it can be. All the while you are bombarded by bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Not that thick, but thicker than most ales.  Drinkability: If for nothing more than people asking, ""What is that?,"" replying, ""Arrogant Batard,"" and then the inevitable, ""No way!,"" this beer is certainly worth drinking.

147,92,poundboy,4.06,"I give this beer my first five in any catorgory. Appearancewise, this one just can't be beat. Split the Pint 9 oz bottle between two pint glasses. Dark copper to amber in color, with the most interesting head I have ever seen out of a bottle. It was less than a 1/4 of an inch think, but dense and creamy as if it was poured draught or from a nitro can. Left traces of lace all over the glass. This is a very well crafted beer. In most heavily hopped beers, all I taste is the hops. But with this one, I could taste the hop bitterness, the hop floweriness, tons of aroma, plus the malt sweetness. In terms of taste, this one falls somewhere between a barelywine and an IPA. No real unusual or extraordinary tastes for the style of beer that it is. It is just a fine example of a hoppy American Microbrew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,bultrey,4.79,"When this beer is fresh and served at the right temperature, it is a revelation. It is, quite simply, the most flattering reflection of the few quality ingredients that go in to making this beer. I feel like I'm at the brewery when I smell this -- fresh amber-roasted barley, and fresh picked hops flowers collide to make an incomporable aroma. The taste is more of the same. Do you want to know what high-quality, unadulterated roasted barley tastes like? Drink this. Do you want to see what pure, concentrated hop flower oil tastes like? Drink this. Oh, I suppose I could go on about nuances of vanilla, and hints of peatiness, and blah, blah, blah. But in a world that is full of beer that cuts corners and utilizes cute gimmicks and eventually loses sight of the goal, Arrogant Bastard reminds us: give yeast something great to work with, and it will produce something greater.  10-25-04 -- Re-reviewed after tasting this on draft at O'Brien's in San Diego last week. Just a totally different beer, even better. Hints of maple and a little whiskey peatiness come through. Hops and malt seem even better balanced.

147,92,claytri,3.91,"It poured a great clear amber with a nice tan head. The aroma was very strong and consisted of hops over burnt malt, it was simple but effective. It had a strong hop taste with burnt malt in the background. The feel was oily with an extremly dry finish. I happened to be in Irvine for a few days and decided to take the opportunity to find an AB and sample it. I found mine at the Yardhouse, and it was worth the effort. The beer definately was well put together and would be a hallmark for it's style. The amount of hops would always put this on my alternate list though.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,gbontrag,4.54,"Thanks for the putdowns on the bottle. I like the sarcasm and in-your-face ""are you down with craft beer, or are you pussy?""--attitude.  Take a sniff...Spruce resin, orange flowers, malty malt, WOW! This is like taking a hit from a 6 foot bong! It's an aromatic orangatuan climbing up my nose, and playing my ole-factory like a jungle gym. The dryness outta shrink my head fast enough to make a headhunter cry with joy as he decorates his tent post with my shriveled, devil-puckered up mug. Astringent but not aseptic; this brewed creation has plenty of expression. In a Barry White voice this beer says to my taste buds, ""Hello taste babies, I'm gonna make love to you."" The taste babes are passing out all over my mouth. What a hit! There's a little smoky, and a lot of sweet malt. A citric rind-like burn on the top of my mouth. This brew is so warm, feels stronger then it says. Man it's taut in the mouth like a live wire with all those hops. There's enough malt to fill your mouth though. Don't be worried about being bored with this munster. The beautiful thick, velvety, steamed milk froth is clinging all over the glass like sex juices after intercourse. What happened in that mug?  Sip and chug your way through 2/3 of a bomber, then kick back and let it warm up. As it warms up you should find yourself contemplating all the naughty things you want to do to satisfy your lover. Sip the last third of this brew saying those things with your eyes.

147,92,IronDjinn,4.65,"Picked up while in Las Vegas. Brown 22 oz. bomber with the typical silk-screened Stone label, but the gargoyle looks meaner on this one. The blurb on the back is priceless, reminds me of The Great Gazoo off of the Flintstones, dumb dumbs. ""Perhaps you're mouthing your words as you read this""--classic.  Definitely not a beer for the general masses, but what do they know, I love this stuff. Pours out a clear chestnut hue, a rich garnet when held to the light, damn sexy! Thick creamy off-white head, impressive retention with a tight cap almost all the way down. A tight wall of lacing also forms down the glass. The nose starts off with intense grapefruit rind hops, the malt gasps for breath as it quickly surfaces, only to be drowned in the hop goodness once again. Almost a bready malt presence, as fleeting as it is. The flavour is initially a smack-down of intense hops and grains, wrasslin' with one another, and you get so caught up in the action, it becomes pointless and far too distracting to begin breaking down the action into an anal play-by-play, you are simply swept along for the ride. A rich meaty malt becomes more apparent as the beer warms up, nearly toasted and caramel, making the gladiators easier to distinguish. Farther down the glass the flavour becomes more complex, but you get so caught up in the action that it takes a micro-biologist to create a spread-sheet for you to break down all the subtle moves and combinations into a discernable mode of operation. After a quick glance at the spread-sheet you are impressed, but proceed to throw it over your shoulder, in order to fully appreciate what is going on without being beaten over the head with the details. The flavour is duelling it out enough as it is. The mouthfeel is rich and velvety, and very inviting considering the extremes of the flavour, a plush welcome mat that you want to use as a bath towel after stepping out of the hot tub with a few frisky members of your preferred gender of attraction. I want more of this stuff, and I want it now, I was a total mud-skipping retard for only grabbing one bottle of this in my travels. Like that annoying dog in the Taco Bell commercials, it's time to make a run for the border.

147,92,orbitalr0x,4.23,"This one pours for the bomber a deep opaque red with some orange tones as well. A small head forms on my glass but doesn't stick around very long. This is a very nicely colored ale and it looks good in the glass. The initial smell is of rich caramel malts and floral hops. This one smells bitter on the nose...there are some alcohol and fruit tones (plums/raisins) as well.  After waiting a few minutes, I take the first taste. Wow..this packs a punch. A nice malt profile hits first and then a wonderful melding of bitter floral hops follows right behind it. The sweet malt flavors and the bitter flavors bring the ale together remarkably well. The biterness lingers a bit but you don't hear me complaining. A slightly roasted, fruity flavor comes through as well...quite a bit going on here.  The mouthfeel is just the way I like it. Wonderfully smooth body with just the right about of carbonation so it goes down easy. Drinkability is good on this one as well...I could see myself having a few Bastards with no problem!

The beer pours a nice bronze with a decent head and excellent lacing.  The beer smells of slightly roasted and smoked malts. Hints of pine and citrus round out the aroma.  The taste is finely balanced and fairly complex. The initial impression is sweetness followed by a medium hop bite. Hints of caramel and smoky molasses. The beer becomes bitterer as it warms and I get a little bit of background fruit (plum) taste. The taste just coats your mouth, which is ok by me.

Just kidding, of course I do. Tastes good, not exactly what I was expecting for some reason. I thought it would be more ""arrogant."" The hops are defintely in full effect, with a mellow malt backdrop. A little piney/grapefruity taste to it. As it goes down I can pick up on the alchohol and there's a likeable bitterness to it, maybe that's the arrogant part? Mouthfeel is pretty standard (for good beer that is), nothing exceptional, but it's a good feeling. I could definately drink this beer all night, it's very good. I think I was expecting to be shocked by something out of this world judging by the other reviews... This is a sturdy, tasty beer, worthy of enjoying for sure.. but I won't be craving it like I do some of my other favorites.  Edit: I've since changed my mind about the Bastard. It's bumped up from ""good beer"" to ""kick ass beer"". I think maybe I was looking for some sort of crazy intense taste when I tried it the first time and therefore overlooked the fact that this is an incredible awesomely balanced beer, with a bite.

Head thinned to thin film fairly quickly but never went away entirely. It also left generous lacing for 3/4 of the beer.  I've had this beer many times, so I knew to leave it to warm up for a couple of minutes before I started drinking it.  Smell is a combination of deep malt and light citrusy hops. Heavy alcohol in the nose as well.  Taste is incredibly intense. Starts off with a heavy 1-2 punch of sharp malt and very bitter hops. Other flavors come in the middle, Fruit (mostly plum) and floral. Strong alcohol flavor in the middle as well.  Finish is very strongly bitter, but not unpleasant.

147,92,oxmasterscream,3.93,"This was my first Stone beer and I finally understand all of the comments about how extreme they are. From a 22 oz. bomber bottle, it poured a beautiful mahogany color (one of the best looking colors I've seen), very clear, with a small head that remained in some capacity throughout the drink and left nice lacing as I drank. From the fridge, the aroma was slightly sweet with a big citrus punch and the smell of new carpeting (anyone else get that - beermail me). As it warmed, more malty aromas became evident - raisins, brown sugar, fresh bread. The taste at first nearly knocked me on my ass. I wasn't ready (and mabye ""not worthy"" as the bottle suggests) for what I experienced. The first taste started out slightly sweet and all of a sudden, my tongue was blasted with a bitterness I've never experienced before; it stayed with me for longer than any other bitter taste in my life. Cold from the fridge, this thing is a hop monster and seemingly nearly out of balance. As it warms, it really starts to come to life though. It gets sweeter and fruitier and either the bitter hops begin to fade or you just get used to the punch they pack... I'm still not sure. Either way, this is a very complex and balanced (but to the extreme) beer. Mouthfeel is medium carbonation, medium bodied, smooth and creamy - really nice. I knocked it down a notch on drinkability because the flavors are so extreme that it can be challenging to drink and the high ABV starts warming you up pretty quickly. I drank the second part of this bomber alongside a bowl of really spicy, cajun (no tomatoes) jambalaya which contained andouille sausage, chicken, peppers and onions, drenched in hot sauce and it stood up to it and complimented it extremely well.

The aroma is reminiscent of warm pumpernickel bread ... and a good bit of honey. A stout flavor, with strong overtones of yeast and hops. Just the right amount of smooth and creamy. A very hearty, well-made ale. I quite enjoyed it. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys darker beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Jacobier10,4.31,"Great appearance. Pours out a ruby color with a light tan head. A slight amount of lacing left on the glass, but great head retention. The aroma was full of caramel and molasses combined with citrus hops. Reminded me mostly of grapefruit. This is a full bodied beer with a creamy/chewy texture. Lively carbonation with a light alcoholic finish. Very heavy on the palate, but it coats your mouth very well. I would definitely want to try some more of these. But be careful, this beer will leave you a little tipsy!  Overall, a superb domestic brew with a lot of complexity. A must try! ---------- Edited on 3/20/2015.

147,92,thecoldesquire,4.43,"Presentation: 22 oz bottle poured into a 20 oz glass.  Appearance: Mahogany colored beer with nice amount of head. Excellent clarity.  Smell: Grapefruity hop aroma with some malt creeping through.  Taste: Wow! This is hoppy. If you love big citrusy American hops (and I do) then this is for you. Hop flavor dominates, but there is some sweet maltiness as well. This beer has an aggressively hoppy taste.   Overall impression: If you love high alcohol, heavily hopped beers, this is for you.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Phyl21ca,4.02,"Bottle: Poured a deep opaque brown colored beer with a medium head with standard retention. Aroma is very powerful and consist mostly of what I think to be hops, a sweet and bitter type of hops though. Taste is quite unique for me (I think this is my first foray into the strong American Ale type) and consist mostly of some strong bitter hops and underline by some very subtle sweetness. Wow, this is like being hit on the head with a brick  plainly lots of malt and hops are included in here. The alcohol is a subtle but complement very well.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Pours a beautiful dark clear amber! nice head, with some retention Smells of malt hops and fruit,quite complex and lovely. taste, is fairly well balanced, but a big wallop, of both hops and malt, if you want a big taste, this is it! and it has the best of both worlds(hops&malt) dueling it out! Mouthfeel is very pleasant, well carbonated, crisp with a bit of creamyness also. drinkability, I'm not sure?,...

147,92,doho95fu,4.72,"This beer has forced me to begin reviewing again. Finally got my hands on a load of west coast brews and my taste buds have been resurrected. This beer is great to look at, but the real treat is the taste.  Smells hoppiers than it tastes. Hints of fruit, but that does not seem to figure prominently in the taste department either.  Thick, in a malty way, with some hops in the background. Really not your typical ale. Undertones of brown sugar and some spice. The taste stays with you for a bit - but that's a good thing. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth considering the ABV. Would love to get a try of this tremendoous brew on tap. Keep it up Stone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Surely enough, curious people ask to try... and the reaction is usually priceless... especially from girls sipping on malternatives. I think one of them actually gagged. Nevertheless, I had to bite my tongue from declaring ""YOU'RE NOT WORTHY!!!!"" And now no girls will taste anything I have in my hand, it is glorious.  If that doesn't give you an idea of this beer... I'll continue. Aggressive, wonderful, hoppy, spicy, caramel, creamy, fruity at times, alcohol comes through just a little bit.

Head retention is great and laces the glass nicely all the way down. Smell is rich and inviting. Heavily roasted and malty aromatics fill my nose. Flavor opens up bitter and spicy, and then the rich and roasted character appears again with a nice layering of hop flavor and finishes with a malty sweetness. This beer is so unique, the flavor profile is really unlike any other beer I have ever tried. Mouthfeel is medium to full and leaves a slight sticky coating on the throat, warming as it goes down. Arrogant Bastard is incredibly tasty, drinkable and in my opinion a nice session beer... cause frankly you can't drink much else after the havok this wreaks on your pallate.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,sacfly,4.68,"Dark ruby red color. Made me think of blood for some reason. Wonderfully sweet, fruity smell. Sweet beginning rapidly becomes an intense (but not too intense) bitterness. Nicely balanced. This place had a great selection of beer on tap, but I every time I looked the beer list over, I found myself ordering another Bastard. Goes down very easily. Maybe due to the slightly lower ABV for a IIPA? Hope it is as good in bottles.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Imagine my surpise when I checked the ""Dorkmaster 9000"" (i.e. my Treo300 with my beer reviews downloaded into it...I know, I need help but it's very handy when out and about and acutally quite discreet) and noticed that I'd not sampled the Bastard on-tap. Time to fix that oversight!  Still the same amber darkness with a tight tannish-colored head. Aromas are complex. Lots of hop notes with a firmly established malt base. This carries into the flavor. At first the hops lie dormant, lulling you into a false sense of security. But they quickly rise up and pounce upon your unsuspecting palate. This hop bitterness isn't going anywhere and it stays entrenched on your palate all the way through the finish. Delightful. Excellent mouthfeel and carbonation. A fixture for me from now on whenever I visit the Ale House(s).",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

A very smooth and well balanced beer though somewhat on the hoppy side - tart citrusy taste and hops you can really notice, but then again it's also got a notcieable sweet and malty flavor. This beer goes down really, really easy with a clean crisp finish. I would probably go so far as to say the Arrogant Bastard is the Great Wallenda of balanced ales (well, before his tragic end anyway.) Super refreshing, I don't think it's as strong with the hops as some people, maybe it was the tap, or the beers I had beforehand....",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The aroma is fruity, green grapes and dried apricots with a nice chocolate aspect thrown in. A bold minty roasted malt initial flavor remains to the finish. Chocolate and bitter, herby hops join in at mid-taste and continue to the end.Fades as a bread-like flavor rounds out the taste. Leaves a lingering minty chocolate taste on the sides of the mouth.

147,92,niknar,4.41,"Nirvana. Pure and simple. This wondrous beer pours out a deep, cloudy, reddish-brown with a decent head of almond color. The bottle alone is worth commenting on. Etched glass instead of the typical stick-on label. This is a collector's item bottle. The smell is strong with tons of sweet malt and maybe some honey. Quite nice. Taste is a complex mixture of overwhelming malty sweetness that is quickly extinguished by a huge bitterness. The finish is strongly bitter and fairly dry. The bitterness lasts several minutes beyond your most recent swallow... if you can wait that long that is! Mouthfeel is exactly what I like... it is something akin to eating a sandwhich. Carbonated to just the right amount...not even close to flat, but definitely not overly carbonated. This is not your average beer by a far stretch. I actually attempted to homebrew a batch of beer that tasted fairly similar to Arrogant Bastard. The difference? Stone Brewery got it right and I really screwed it up! This is one for the books... drink it alone, with friends, at a movie, in the park... you can't go wrong with this one. But a word of caution... this isn't for everyone (just like the bottle says).

147,92,oggg,4.23,"This is quite possibly the most gorgeous beer I've ever had from the bottle. Rich luxurious dark amber, topped by a copious solid tan, super thick and chewy head. The head is amazing. So dense. Just beautiful. The nose is full of sweet malt and vinous alcohol, with the earthy hops taking a secondary role. The taste begins with a smooth mild carbonation, then a rich malty, caramel and sugary beginning. It then shows its vinous alcohol, like whisky. The bitterness is heavy but the hop flavor is restrained to let the malt shine through. So smooth except for the whisky part. So chewy. Full bodied.  This brew is so thick and rich and chewy... I can see how it led up to the Double Bastard, which I still like better. The whisky taste is appropriate for the style I suppose, though not exactly to my taste. I had the Oaked Bastard at the Real Ale festival and didn't like it, and perhaps part of it was because it was so unexpected.

Well, it's a Friday afternoon and I'm ready to dig into this beer.  I grabbed this beer out of the refridgerator and let it sit for about 15 minutes. The appearance is a full colored dark red, borderline brown. Marvelous head on top.  This is a super hopped and rich ale. One of the smoothest 7.2% ABV beers that I've tasted yet. Nicely complex with so many different flavors hitting your palate at once. I taste sweetness in the beginning and bitterness at the end.

147,92,chriscolby,4.3,"The bottlecap told me I wasn't worthy, but I plowed ahead regardless.  Amber-ruby colored beer with nice, creamy head. Solid, American-style hop nose supported by malty aromas and sweet, crystal malt aromas. The aroma is balanced towards the hops, but the malt isn't completely overpowered.  To me, the flavor seemed more balanced than the aroma, with the malt making a bigger impression. The malt is big and chewy, which helps to hide the substantial amount of alcohol (7.2% ABV) in this beer. The initial bitterness is big, almost punishing, and hop character follows through into the flavor and aftertaste, which is a bit coarse. The beer is full-bodied, with a mouthfeel that seems to me to be a mix of creamy and prickly. Very substantial without being cloying or satiating.  This is a big bruiser of a beer. Everything about it is upfront and in your face. It has a nice three-way balance between the hops, malt and booze, which to me are all at their maximum for a drinkable (as opposed to sippable) beer. A little more of any one, and I'd have to slow way down. My highly subjective impression is that none of the elements (hops, malt, booze) seem integrated into the other elements, but rather are simply opposed to each other in near-perfect balance -- or as if all three were trying to get through a doorway at once and were hindering each other's prgress. Or maybe it's just the booze talking. Or maybe it's true -- I'm not worthy! Man, now I need another one of these.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Scents are reminiscent of a Barleywine.  A rugged balance of malts and hops duke it out with the vigor of a boxing match. Back 'n forth. Sugary thick body and malts ending with a compact yet pronounced long hops finish. Almost taste like a pancake with Aunt Jemima. A she warms, the awl-kee-hawl essence is clear.  Thick syrupy sizzle and body to this heavyweight. Due to the big 7.2 % ABV and thickness, this is not an all nighter. One 22 oz.'er does me in for some ""You're not worthy"" Arrogant Bastard.

Apperance: Pours a deep, muddy brown with an ample head.  Smell: Lots going on here. Bitter hops, with perhaps some chocolate, cloves and coffee on those. Not easy to figure out all the flavors floating over this.  Taste: The first sip pulls in a good solid wall of hop bitterness. It's a wall you have to chew your way through before finding the some slight fruity hop flavors and caramel malt background on the midsip. The hops aren't gone though, and come back to leave a dark, musky bitteness on the palate, taunting you to take the next sip.  When I first tried this, I would have said you were crazy if you thought it was drinkable. Well, I don't think that anymore, but this is sure a beer you'll want to build up to.

There is a good deal of Belgian lace that clings thickly to the glass throughout.  The aroma is subtle and hard to pinpoint, but is very pleasant. The first taste, full of creamy foam is wonderful. The abv is somewhat apparent throughout with a strong alcohol flavor, but definitely not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is tingly on the roof of the mouth with ample carbonation and hop flavor.

Hey, that's what I tasted at least!  A real nice beer! As I stated earlier, I'm really starting to like these beers.

Nothing else I have ever had tastes quite like this.Very, very hoppy, and being that I am not a hop fan, I did not care for that taste like I thought that I would. Poured a dark garnet copper red colour with a dirty sand-like head. The head faded away to a thin film quickly.

Taste is wildly complex and aggressive with spicy, citrusy and piney hop bitterness balanced by substantial malt with flavors of caramel and dark fruit and just a touch of cocoa and a healthy dose of alcohol esters. Mouthfeel is very nice and smooth with perfect carbonation. Drinkability I rate a little less because of alcohol content and aggressive flavor, although thats what this beer is all about.  This is a highly recommended beer that I would probably buy more if I could get it easier. Picked this one up at Kclingers in Hanover.

Aroma of hops, mainly citrus and a nice malt sweetness to round it out, more so than I remember from the bottle. The taste seems much more smooth and less rough.

Tangy sweet toasty malt upfront gives way to caramel and spicy hops. Finishes with a juicy hop bitterness accented by grapefruit, pine resin and citrus rind. Excellent! Awesome mouthfeel.

Hints of more estery compounds...raisins or prunes, maybe.  A very complex flavor. Seems like it turns the corner into something different 5 or 6 times within a single sip. Moderate malt, something between a brown ale and a red. Walks the middle ground between sweet and dry, with a bit of nuttiness to the malts as well. There's a sort of muted softness to the mouthfeel, airy even. 7.2 ABV is very well hidden; citrus and mildly floral hops make themselves known without causing a ruckus. Faint hints of tangy orange and raisin echo in the aftertaste. There's a yeasty, bakery-fresh note as well.  For all the propaganda and swagger, this isn't that beastly of a brew...Ruination (or even the ""other demon beer"", Maudite) would be a better WMD against the unwashed fizzy beer hordes.

Smell: Immediate wave of citrus hop/green apple yeast. Levels off with a dense malty sweetness, with strong cherry and caramel notes. Some grassiness.  Flavor/Mouthfeel: Whoa. You'll notice the mouthfeel first, a thick, creamy, slightly milky wonder with enough carbonation to keep it interesting--kicks ass.  The flavor is huge but, despite all the Ronny James Dio devil heads and whatnot, it's actually quite balanced and nice. Chocolate and carmel malt hit first, with nice hints of cherry and dark fruit. There's some smokiness later on, and the bitterness and drying of the hops show up to finish. All of the flavors blend and linger in the aftertaste, and a bit of a Chambord liquor taste emerges. It becomes peppery much later. It's quite something and a bit similar to SN's Bigfoot, although not nearly as hoppy fresh and raw.  Drinkability: Huge, but really enjoyable. I couldn't drink it all night, but I'd could handle another bomber, for sure.  Wow. I think it's actually more of a barleywine than an ale, but whatever it is, it is one tasty mofo.

147,92,HardTarget,4.59,"Enjoyed on-tap at the Flying Saucer, Ft. Worth All comments made in comparison to bottled Arrogant Bastard Aroma: Much more pleasant and hoppy. Juicy (Im guessing Cascade) grapefruit hops on a more subtle malt base. Appearance: Dark amber, clear, with a beige head that left a few lace marks. Flavor: Much more mellow and blended flavors than the bottle. The hops just pop out, they taste fresh and aggressive, but not as, well, arrogant. The malt base just seems to fit better in the overall taste. Except for the fresh hop aroma and flavors, I would guess the keg had aged a bit, which is not out of the realm of possibility. Mouthfeel: Medium-heavy with a little hop pucker and chew. It just seemed creamier. Overall Impression: Extremely enjoyable. I may have to learn to age a few bottles to see if they mellow out to where the kegs seem to be. Where the bottles seem like a full frontal assault on every sensory organ you own, this is more of a controlled takeover, an authoritative, methodical full Swedish massage of every sensory organ you own.

147,92,Hunter,3.26,"This brewery, and this beer, have quite a reputation here, so I avoided as much as possible others' reviews before sampling it.  Beer pours out a lovely ruby color, almost like brandy, with thin carbonation and a lasting tan head. Coffee, strong hops, and dark chocolate in the nose, with a back scent of fruit. A wine-like essence emerges as the glass warms to room temperature, along with - dare I say it? - a hint of beefsteak. The astingency is the first thing to hit the palate upon drinking, but it quickly mellows to a smoother hit of hops and sweet malt. The taste of alcohol is predominant. Chimay does a better job in their product of sublimating that high alcohol under other flavors...but given the name of this one maybe that's the whole point. Aftertaste is heavy in smoke, not pleasant but bearable. That smoke hangs around in the mouth for some time between sips. My impression of this beer got progressively more positive as I drained my glass (and at 7.2% ABV, that's no shock).  If beer was wine, I'd classify this as a port. Something to be sipped slowly, savored after a gourmet meal, but this is not a thirst-quencher you'd slug down. Frat boys with bongs need not apply. Certainly a beer to include in your regular rotation. I'll be reviewing it again in the future.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,WesWes,4.12,"The beer pours a dark ruby red color with a thick off-white head that slowly fades. The aroma is great! It has a rich malt scent which is enhanced with the presence of beautiful citrous hops. The taste is good. It has a complex malt core which gives it a dark, yet very bitter flavor along with some intense flavoring hops. This brew is truely fantastic. It goes down easy and has a lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great sessions brew. It has great flavor; a good drinker.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Southernbrew,4.28,"Ah, my last Stone brew after a quick jump to Chattanooga. Hopefully this will be in Georgia after July.  Medium-dark brown, nice light tan head.  Nice hop aroma, but sweet maltiness is present too. Light caramels in there and just a light hint of alcohol.  Full body, fairly smooth. Tons of flavors here, am I unworthy? Very pleasant hoppiness, very balancing malts as well. Light caramel. Light fruit flavors show up in the middle. An assertive but not overpowering alcohol finishes it up. Nice lacing the whole way down.  Awesome brew, I'm sure there's things I'm missing, but this is really top notch.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,nixhecks,4.32,"Presented in a 22oz bottle with quite a humorous description on the backside and a cool pic on the front, all painted label. Poured a deep, dark ruby brown color with two finger off white head. Pretty good retention on the head and leaving sticky lace. Aroma is spicy citrusy hops, sweet fruit, with a background of chocolate maltiness - really a pleasant unique aroma. Taste starts as a malty cocoa, toasted grain flavor, and finishes with a really spicy kick from the hops and a bitter, warming alcohol effect at the very end. Excellent beer, and still very drinkable despite the aggresiveness that the back label describes. While it is aggressive, if you like a hopped up strong ale this can't be beat. Very balanced and unique.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Gasp100,4.52,"My first (and currently only) Arogant Bastard Ale. Pours a dark, cloudy mahogany with small head and medium lacing. The smell is overpowering Hops - piney, citrus Malts - sweet, smokey, dark ripe fruits, etc.... Man, a little bit (or a big bit) of everything in this here beer. The taste knocked me on my ass... I really mean that. At 7.2% this is a serious brew but man the deep chestnuts, smokiness, ripe fruit, pine, citrus... very serious brew. The initial taste reminded me of another brew ""Black Douglas"" which is actually a Scotch brew where the alcohol was very prevalent, but the malty sweetness really balanced it out --- the big difference with this brew was the intense hop bitterness that just kept on coming but never overpowered the other flavors. This is no hype, no lie, on my top 5 of best all around brews. I think a case of bombers is warranted... and just think, I've still got Double Bastard hanging out in the cellar.... sweet! One last thing -- for all this beer is offering it's still drinkable... no poundable, but definitely more than one if you're lucky enough to find singles.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,moulefrite,4.4,"Wow, what a beauty of a beer right out of the gate! Pretty mahogany with bright orange and ruby hues. The head lays thick, and creamy, unflinching, begging to be tasted. The stick is solid all the way. A complex aromatic brew featuring sweet, grainy, breadlike aromas followed by inticing hop bitter. In the mouth this baby is thick and rich, bordering syrupy. A taste delight, once past the lips, the beer drips with flavor-toasty malt, a wonderfull fruitiness mid-palate adds a kiss of sweetness. A well balanced, while never delicate brew. A twangy, peppery, highly assertive hop bitter prevails on the mile long finish. A mouthfull of un-apologetic goodness, and a great way to cap off a fine day off here in Chicago, courtesy of the downright, upright, Jackndan! Thanks for the treat my friend!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jazzmac,4.4,"Love the ""You're not Worthy"" story on the bottle. Pours a nice copper color with beautiful lacing of the head. The smell of hops is overwhelming, but not in a bad way, very balanced and enticing. On first taste the hops assault your tongue awakening your taste buds for the rest of the glass. Finishes with hops lingering in your mouth. The beer has lived up to hype and is worth seeking out if you can't get it locally. The intersting thing is the beer seems to change as it gets warmer, the hops almost seperate themselves into different flavor categories as the temperature increases. It would be an interesting test to blind taste the beer at 40 degrees and at 50 degrees to see if anyone could tell if it was the same beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,merlin48,4.55,"I could've sworn I reviewed the Bastard several months ago, but must not have been worthy. Served slightly chilled in a St Bernardus goblet for the 130th running of the Kentucky Derby. Pours a regal dark orange, almost opaque, body with a three finger, beige head. Sticky sheets of lace appear all over the goblet. Impressive appearance!  Aroma: Citrus hops hit the nose first, with orange and cantelope aromas, followed by grapefruit, then pine. Some no-nonsense hops here! Dark fruit aromas, highlighted by raisins, emerge as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Hops resins coat the mouth thoroughly, and a pinecone hops bite tingles the tongue. Nice, medium body.  Taste: Pine and grapefruit are up front in the initial taste. Winesap apple flavors come on as this nears room temperature. Much smoother at room temperature, as plum and raisin flavors emerge, and malt tries to climb onto the palate. Alcohol is cleverly disguised by the amazing complexity. Finish features the brashly assertive, Cascades hoppiness again, with pine and grapefruit in the aftertaste.  Comments: A wonderful elixer, deserving of its hype, and perfectly drinkable. I was surprised by the aggressive hop character, and expected a more assertive malt presence for what is classified as a strong old ale. But, certainly not disappointed in this modern American classic. Wish I had a few cases of this in the cellar!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,rdrummer,4.55,"I have been waiting a long time to get my hands on some Stone Brews. It was worth the wait.  Start with the hilarious bomber with ""You're Not Worthy"" on the front, and ""Refrigerator this, numbskull"" on the side. On the back of the bottle, Stone actually says that you should forget trying the beer because you probably are sophisticated enough to enjoy it. The experience just keeps going from there. It pours a dark mahognay color with a beige head with tremendous white lacing. The lacing is so thick, I found myself mesmerized by it.  There is a smell of the toasted malt with a bit of hops kicker. I liked the fruity undertones, almost grapey. But the taste is why I was there, and it is unbelievable. A very rich and complex brew with plenty of maltiness, yet with much of the creaminess I associate with darker brews. There was a bit of caramel, fruity undertones, an alcohol kick, and a hops bitterness that came on at the end. This is a very complex, wonderful beer.  It is fruity and smooth in the mouth but that bitterness lingers. It is full-bodied and good from first sip to last drop. And Stone was right, ""I am not worthy.""",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,wailingwench,4.8,"Foam factor: Poured a beautiful crimson brown with a white billowy head that entertained me untill the last drop. I could stare at a pint of this all night, it's that pretty.  Skunk Factor: Big, bold, and complex. Floral hops with malt undertones gave way to citrus.  Tongueland: Mr. Tongue danced for joy. It is amazing to see a tongue do the Electric Slide. Anyways, the comlexity of this beer was amazing. Started off similar to one of my favorites, Wailing Wench (my namesake!!!). Bold hops overpowered with malt kicking in, and finally hops again. It felt like there was a boxing match in my mouth. Arrogant impressed me as if finished like an Ellicotville Pale Ale, all grapefruit. This fools your pre-frontal cortex into thinking that you are merely drinking grapefruit juice, and thus, can drink as much as you want.  I feel like a crack addict. I know that Arrogant is on tap not even 2 miles from my house. Arrogant is so good that I had to hide my wallet and car keys in order to avoid a bender.

Great beer overall.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,david23,4.75,"Pours a reddish brown with a billous head that never went away. beautiful lacing to the finish. Aroma of hops and a roated malt that is oh so inviting. Although it has a high ABV content I never felt this got in the way of the superb rich malt that receed for a while to be replace by the hop flavoring only to give way again for more rich malt. Defintely one of the best of it's style. As this will now be distributed locally, I am looking forward to enjoying it when the mood strikes me to just relax and take some time to enjoy a really great brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Pours a nice reddish brown with a thin caramel colored head that is very light in froth and not too much retention. Lightly hop scented and light carbination. Very hoppy beer with good bitterness. Tastes of toffee and caramel, burnt toast, little bit of licorish. Very hoppy and great tasting beer. Good and strong and full of flavor like i like 'em! May not be a good session beer due to the 7.2%, but wonderful and a good staple in my home!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,AllThingsNinja,4.28,"Poured into a tumbler from a 22oz bottle, the beer developed a fair and retentive head. The deep reddish brown liquid is quite enticing. The aroma is dominated by the intense hops, with strong citrus notes - grapefruit, and hints of pine. The taste is surprisingly well balanced. There is a big malt presence which is almost bigger than the unquestionably intense hops. The flavors roll between caramel and grapefruit. The beer was well bodied, and quite drinkable - but not exactly, a session brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Zorro,3.88,"Pours a clear very dark ruby brown ale.  Smells sweet and hoppy as hell, it's a hop monster.  There might be some complex flavors in here but the hops obliterates everything else. Bitter in the extreme.  Mouthfeel is ok.  Not really drinkable. Might be able to choke it down.  Flushed the rest of the bottle down the toilet.  RE-REVIEW, yes I am the guy who gave this an overall 2.0.  4.5 2 1 2 1  The first time I reviewed this.  Appearance is still a ""Pours a clear very dark ruby brown ale.""  Smell is sweet and malty with a banana scent that is rather nice. Nice malt and tutty fruity scent to this.  Taste is still super hoppy although I can taste the other good points mainly the malt and fruity flavors from the hops. Still this is a mighty bitter brew.  Mouthfeel is good.

I actually took a pic with my digital, I know...  smell - smelled nice, fruity/citrusy with a sharpness to it is my best description.  taste - first sip hits with some refreshing sweetness, citrus and sugar. It was almost cherry like to me, but I am new at this. Went down very smooth with a slightly bitter aftertaste to it(didn't like that part too much) but it was overpowered by the beginning and middle of the taste.  Mouthfeel - pleasant, smooth  Drinkability - I could have had another very easily, but I was too interested in the 75 or so other beers I had to choose from.  Overall a great beer, and I was not disappointed by the hype, it doesn't make the top of my list but I would definitely drink it again, whether on tap or not.

147,92,FormatKid,4.77,"I purchased this 22oz bomber at Ziggys in Chattanooga. Ive had it before so the intimidation tactics from the label dont work anymore.  This beast pours out a rusty, murky, reddish-brown. I think sticky, craggy head rolls up a bit more than two-fingers height. Not a lot of carbonation to be seen, most likely due to the hazy nature of the brew. Lacing grabs on tightly in big globs and slides its way down the glass.  The smell is lovely and complex. Big grape-fruit presence up front, pine and floral aromas make their presence known as well. This however is backed up by a solid as a rock malt background, lightly sweet, and powdery fine. Maybe one of the best smelling beers I have ever encountered.  The taste is all there too. Damn, its just so fine. Juicy grapefruit practically explodes across my tongue, revealing a chewy caramel background. Brings to mind a caramel coated hop concoction on a stick, just awesome. Mouthfeel is perfect, lightly-heavy if I had to categorize it. The carbonation is light and playful.

147,92,DaveGood,4.71,"This has got to be one of the finest strong ales! The bottle alone, not to mention the warning on the case that it was pulled from was enough to get me to try this fine beer.  It poured a deep brown with a ruby-like tint to it. The two finger head was light tan and stuck around for a while before giving way to a nice lace. This is the way that a beer should look!  The aroma was was filled with hops. I distinctly detect the scent of grapefruit before giving was to some sweet malts.  The taste was very complex and hop-filled to say the very least. It begins with a sweet toasted malt taste before giving way to a citrus/grapefruit like hops taste. The tail end is a little bit bitter.  The mouthfeel was surprsingly smooth, given the higher alcohol content. Very well balanced between the hops and malt.  Overall, this beer is definitely one of my favorites. I will be drinking this one fairly regularly.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,RootedFool,4.7,"Bomber purchased at the North Coast Co-op in Eureka, California.  Pours reddish mahogany. The head is a lovely, frothy orange-tinged pile.  The nose is a hefty pillow of bready malts and an incisive jab of citrusy, spicy hops. Going deeper, I pick up in some very sweet, bubble gum notes -- but the raspy hops keep the sweetness on its knees.  Taste opens with a juicy burst of toasty malts and serves as a stable background to the firecracking hops that waste no time making their presence known.  The hop presence is dense and broadsides my palate, as opposed to a more shrill, narrow stab of bitterness found in many other hoppy brews.  The finish is close to dry, pleasantly bitter.  Mouthfeel is creamy and palate-massaging.  More than a hint of carbonation.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,99bottles,4.2,"I finally got to try this last night at KClinger's Publik House. When I saw it on the board, I almost fell off my stool. Finally, I get to try this West Coast marvel, and on tap no less. Appearance: AB is a really deep reddish brown color, like mahogany. There is a small off white head that disappeared on mine. Smell: There's a lot going on here, but the predominant smell is of sweet malt. Some hops come through, but mostly sweetness. Taste: The first sip is very intense. The heavy malt reminds one of cane sugar or carmelized sugars. Very sweet and full. After that, an angry bunch of hops assert themselves, and meld with the malt. There is quite a bit going on here, good interplay of flavors. Mouthfeel: Not overly heavy, but rather just a good full drink. Leaves slight coating on the tounge from its higher alcohol. Drinkability: Good. I could have another. This really is an intense beer though, so I doubt I could toss them back in succession. Nice to have had it though. I'm going back for a growler.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,govtmule,4.6,"I had my first AB at Monk's in Philly. I have to say that is a good beer. It was too dark to really get a good look at the appearance, but from what I could see it was a nice cherry or mahogany wood color. Nice frothy head. The taste is the best part of this beer. I'm still working on how to describe beers, but all I can say is that this beer is pretty intense. Lots of flavor.

147,92,smcolw,4.34,Cascading full head that poured three fingers thick; this is something I expect only from the nitro-can stouts. Unfiltered cloudiness with an orange hue from a bright backlight. Maroon-brown in normal light. Very impressive sticky lace on the glass sides.  Grassy dark malt aroma up front; strong molasses-like smells. Sweet like caramel candy or maple syrup.  The flavor is rich and complicated. Strong carmelized sugar flavors in the beginning of the sip. The hops crecendo slowly and powerfully. I am fascinated with the experience after the swallow: the molasses sweetness returns followed by an intense IPA-like hop bitterness. This beer has a body like light cream. The higher-than-typical carbonation provides the perfect foil to nearly overwhelming flavors.  This beer offers one of the best carnival taste rides: malty to hoppy to candy sweetness to dry hop bitterness. I'd love to know how they made this beer. It's like drinking a symphony.

It seems that my ratings are proportionate to the length of the review.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Head retention is good with a head remaining for a long time. Smells hoppy. First taste reveals a strong bitter hoppy presence. Tastes like an IPA. Very in your face hop presence. Aftertaste remains for a long time. I'm searching for anything other than the strong bitter hops taste. I thought I got a little citrus undertones on the first sip but that doesn't seem present in the second. I'm probably drinking a little warmer than ideal serving temperature. I prefer something a little better balanced. A decent selection but not one I would travel miles for.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Foxman,4.28,"It pours a dark muted amber, with an impressive three fingers of light tan head that sticks around a good long while. Fingers of lacing wind almost maniacally about the inside of the glass.  The aroma brings a mad rush of dry citrus, like flowery grapefruit juice, but a companion caramel malt presence disavows one of that notion. A smooth, gentle vanilla air keeps the edges rounded.  The first sip delivers a smooth toffee malt sweetness frolicking with a dry perfumed grapefruit bitterness. The alcohol provides a soothing warming sensation as a partner. The citrus plays again in the middle, almost delivering pulp to the palate. A lightly baked biscuit presence graces the stretch run before a dry hops bitterness lingers and slowly fades. The elemental balance is, simply, a fun taste experience.  Roughly medium bodied, it coats capably and takes its time slipping away. The palate glows with a dry tingle at the finish.  While a bit less beefy than some of its brethren, it's arguably more artfully balanced. It's also simpler than some Stone offerings, but that is in no way a down note. It's malt, it's hops, and it delivers both in a smooth blend. And there is just no way that one is enough, no matter the sign on the bottle. It's likely that arrogance never tasted so good.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The beer is ruby in color, very cool to look at. Smell is very respectable and bold, malty and yeasty, with a hint of sweetness. Taste is very complex. Lightly carbonated, this beer is semi-sweet with a subtle bitter aftertaste. I discovered flavors such as the bitter of grapefruit (which I didn't really like since I don't like grapefruit) and the bite of baking chocolate. Thumbs up to this brew.

Smell comes with a heavy malt and hit of grapefruit. Slight touch of phenols detectable also.  Flavor, so rich and complex, it's taken me two bombers to even start expressing the flavors of this beer. Initially it's rich and complex maltiness. light caramels, and a mild roastiness are also detectable. As it hits back on the tongue, the hops slap you across the face.

The taste is not nearly as bold as I was expecting. I'm not normally a hop-head, but this is hops well done. Some sweetness and citrus up front, but the hops really dominate the flavor. The citrus, grapefruity twang really helps to balance the bitterness and keep it in line. It packs a bitter aftertaste, but not overwhelmingly so.  The mouthfeel is very smooth and pleasantly bubbly.  Overall, a very smooth drinking beer.

Lace is also quite minimal, and the beer has very still appearance in general. Aroma is on the sweetish side with flowery hops and malts that smell like honey. I can also detect a fair bit of grain on the nose with hints on vanilla and oak. Malt profile is very Scottish with sweet caramel, plum, cherry, vanilla, and a bit of smoked grain. Hops are quite detectable, and become more pronounced as the beer warms some. The hops add some dryness to the aftertaste due to their spicy, woody character, but they are not really bitter. As the beer gets warmer still, the malts that had been subdued by the hops make a big comeback with very fruity esters. Silky smooth mouthfeel with a nicely warming alcohol content.

The pour was incredible, dark copper-red with a beautiful foamy head an inch thick that fell to a creamy thin line that stuck to the sides of the glass throughout the drink. The smell was full of strong hop spice with a hint of malt and a slight floral overtone.

There is a strong raisin taste in this beer which yields to a strong hop profile. The smell hints at more malt than the taste would have you believe.

But I shall review nonetheless...  It had a nice appearance, good color, but not too much of a lasting head. At least for me. The taste was strong and hoppy. The malt would break through, then recede. That was a nice touch. Very hoppy. It mellowed a bit as it got warmer (or maybe it was due to just sitting).

It's very fragrant, sweet raisin and sharp hops rising to each breath.  When I drink, I find a big alcohol warmth and tiny bubbles.

147,92,Stimack,3.79,"Ok, finally got my hands on one of these brews. As it seems to be one of the most discussed brews on BA, I was very excited to give it a try.  The brew came in a 22 oz brown bomber, which has a nice different look to it. You have to read the back of the brew, very funny! The brew pours to a deep red color with a nice inch high head that will not break down! The brew has left nice heavy off white lacing on the sides of the glass.  The aromas of this brew are heavy on the hops that give a floral smell, also can notice hints of a fruit essence. Hard to pick out the malt as it seems to be over powered by the hops.  The taste is quite complex, even though it seems to be quite smooth. Can sense some caramel and roasted flavor up front that go nice with the brew. Has a bit of an alcohol taste to it, but not overly strong. The brew finishes with a very noticeable hop punch that smooth out to a somewhat sweet taste? Over all a nice brew, not one of my favorite styles, but I can see why it has the (much deserved) hype.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

With a two finger head, the head stays for quite some time and gives way to a nice, sticky, off-white lace. This certainly does look like it deserves the reputation this beer has garnered.  Smell: not to thrilled with the smell actually. Nothing too special, some malt, fruitiness, and a little bit of alcohol.  Taste: Nice, very malty, a little hoppy and very smooth. There is a slight hint of alcohol heat.  Mouthfeel: This is one of the best that I have experianced of the style, it's smooth but not so smooth it feels like oil. This definitely has some bite, but nothing too overpowering.  Drinkability: This is by no means a session beer, with a 7.2% abv, it's not the kind of thing you can drink in bulk, but I'm sure glad that this is one I got to try.  Notes: Still not sure if I'm worthy, but at least bottles can't be the judge.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Billolick,4.28,"on tap, fresh and tasty! pours a regal dark auburn, tiny bubbles lifting a moderate head and leaving some killer lace. This brew oozes HOPS, citrus, grapefruit, resins.

147,92,BitteBier,4.65,"Um...wow. My beermate and I raved about this one from start to finish. Some beers are interesting in a novel way; others are simply good and balanced. This one is both and then some. Pours a unique ruby-brown color with a respectable amount of head and some active carbonation. From the moment the beer hits the glass, the smell bloodies your nose with a barrage of grapefruit. As the beer warms and the citrus hops scatter a bit, some pleasant malts are detectable as well. The grapefruit notes carry over to the taste, but the flavors evolve nicely over time. By the time I was done, the hops were fading to a dry Scotch-like malty flavor. In between is something of a caramely balance of flavors. Resins cling a lot at first though not unpleasantly. As the taste gives way to malts, the mouthfeel likewise gives way to a richer, softer texture. Despite its intensity, this one is very drinkable. This will be one to savor in the future, as well as to expose my yellow beer-drinking friends to what an assertive, creative brewer can do.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,silenius,4.17,"I had to go all the way to Ohio (from Chicago) to get one of these since Stone brews are not available in Chicago at this time.  Served from a 22oz. bomber at fridge temp. I popped the top and I could smell the hops immediately. It pours a dark reddish brown that looks just like Lipton tea that has been steeping for a good long time. The head was about 1cm thick and quickly gave way. It laced my glass nicely.  It smells like that Fruit Stripe gum along with some malty sweetness. That is all I got off of it.  It has a wonderful dry sweet taste (not cloying in the slightest) that makes my mouth water. The hops lived on my tongue and invaded my teeth for an eternity.  The beer feels light in my mouth and undistinguished, but the taste is anything but light.  By the end of the bomber, the bitterness overwhelmed my palate and muscled out any nuance in the beer, therefore the 3.5 rating for drinkability. I wanted the sweetness to last and not be overwhelmed by the bitter.  Do I think Stone products are over-hyped? Yes, a bit. Will I have another Arrogant Bastard? Certainly.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,travolta,4.25,"I drank this AB from a regular glass. It was easy to pour and smelled wonderful coming out. Color: Rusted Amber. The Tan head was minimal and did not last long(not for five bucks anyway). Nose: Hoppy, fruity, crisp. Taste: Initial hoppiness, fruity, syrupy after taste. The first sip begs you to take the next. It is very easy to drink. The after taste ""feels"" foamy... Is that a description, ""foamy""?

147,92,twilight,4.78,"Who says you can't buy hoppiness?  Shall I compare this beer to a summer's day? I usually don't like people who are bastards, or arrogant, but this one has deserves the moniker. Beautiful red pour with a thick, enticing creamy head, that retains very well. Lacing is amazing, beautiful. Smell is of slight alcohol with a wafting of hops to warn you that this beer is not to be messed with. My nonick pint is still trembling from the pour. Taste- Taste is- thick, not quite chewy malt goodness overtaken by serious hoppyness, with alcohol mixing in with the hops before giving way to a pleasantly bitter aftertaste. This begs to be sipped again. Not too quickly, though, as seven percent is more than most mere mortals can manage. Slight carbonation, not overpowering at all- heck, it's there, but with beer this good, you're going to be concerned with other hoppening matters. A good introduction to the hoppy and malty potential of beer. Let the masses drink their tasteless macro yellow junk. They're not worthy. I raise my pint of the Bastard to them. Bwahaha!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,sulldaddy,4.06,"HAd this brew at Kclingers today with some PA BAs. The brew came to me in a pint glass with about 1 cm of soft beige colored head. The head retention was incredible as there was always some throughout my sampling. The color is rich dark ruby and amber. Aroma is mostly pine hops and some earth scents as well. Surprisingly mild aroma overall. The brew has very soft mild carbonation like a cask ale should and the body is fairly thick but not quite chewy, but slightly creamy. Flavor, oh yea this is good. I get a hit of sweet caramel up front but this is quickly overshadowed by a wave of piney hops through the middle and the finish is dominated by these same hope. Some grapefruity flavors come through as well. This is a very crisp brew. There is a hint of alcohol on the finish as well which adds to the bitterness and definately increases the warming factor. Cant believe this was on cask!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jtfest,4.3,"I am not worthy.  The bottle warned me that I would not like this ale. LIES! It poured a beautiful dark amber with a substantial, lasting foamy brown head. Big hop aroma with malt undertones and hints of freshly cut grass. The mouthfeel was full and creamy with a light carbonation. Sweet malt up front, hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste, this is an ale that says ""you're drinking me and you're liking me or to Hell with ya'!"" Not being one who wishes for Hell, I choose to enjoy this brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ViveLaChouffe,4.57,"Pours a hazy ruby-brown, almost opaque. Has a lacy tan head. the smell is big brown malt, caramel. Hints of hops and spice in equal amounts.  Wow. Big malt but a very very hoppy taste comes right after. Wouldn't have expected it to be this big from the aroma. Very full bodied malt with an extremely assertive hops profile. It would sound like this beer is just a one-dimensional big beer but it's actually very well balanced and complex. There are alot of strong flaovors in here (sweet malt, caramel, hops and spice) and they all complement each other wonderfully. On top of all that, it's just one ass-kicker of a beer, in ABV and big taste. I am always suspicious of ""gimmicky"" ad campaigns but Arrogant Bastard is a perfect name for this brew. Lives up to the hype.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,palliko,5,"I finally got a gallon of this brew this week! A local pizza parlor had my favorite beer on tap, and Oh my Lord. This is so awesome. The color is a deep brown - thick creamy head that lasts - the aroma of pungent grapefruit rind comes just short of overwhelming the senses - you want hops? HOPS in three foot high letters. Alcohol fumes drift up and are overcome by the sweet malt which is in turn over come by a killer dry, bitter aftertaste, redolent of black coffee. This beer has become a local favorite. You gotta try this!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Rastacouere,3.08,"Deep copper body with a thin light brown head, dark and taunting. Aroma contains a truckload of bold hops, one of those beers that smell thick, probably due to abundant crystal malt? Light citrus character and a suggestion at leather. Taste is very crystal malty with a weird hop profile leading to a untypical dry finish (chalky, dusty, ashes and slightly smokey). Very bitter aftertaste. Body is typical Stone, very full, thick, almost syrupy. Not my favorite Stone, but I gotta recognize the attitude.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Aroma is brash and bold hops with grapefruit, dark caramel, a bit of chocolate, some darker fruits, some cinnamon and nutmeg notes. First, a bready biscuit enters your mouth. Flashes of tingly fruits appear and disappear, seemingly battling the malt inside your mouth. Thick and slick feel Alcohol makes itself known in the finish, where it stands alongside the fruity bitter hops and a sugary mouthfeel.  I found traits of many styles in this brew. While looking/smelling/drinking this, I thought - this is an amber ale, no this is an IPA, no this tastes a bit like a porter, but a bit like a stout. This is great.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BuckeyeNation,4.23,"My first Stone beer (IPA) was quite an experience, so I'm approaching Arrogant Bastard Ale with a great deal of anticipation and some pretty high hopes. The label attempts to frighten me off, but fails.  Dark coppery orange with a pale toffee-colored crown. The beer looks slightly menacing, if that's possible. I think I hear an intermittent growling sound, but decide that it must be my imagination. The head is not as generous as it might be (ultimately a barely-covering film), but does leave behind some nice, dense sheets of lace. If my first two are anything to go by, Stone beers are uniformly gorgeous in the glass!  The aroma is interesting. I can't say that I've smelled a beer quite like it before. It's a sort of sweet, caramel-like, roasted maltiness infused with citrus zest. If this beer smells like it tastes, I'm in for a real treat. Arrogant Bastard is not called a strong/old ale for nothing.  The flavor is strong, assertive, aggressive and in-your-face. The label does not lie. I find myself sipping this beast, not because of the alcoholic strength (a relatively tame 7.2%), but from the sheer taste bud swamping, gustatory overload. If it intensifies as it warms, my tongue may throw up the white flag.  Citrus fruity hops are on full display. However, because there's such a huge, caramel-like, toasted maltiness, they aren't as upfront as in the IPA. Malt-hop balance is achieved... a remarkable feat since each one threatens to crush its side of the overburdened scales. Wow! Boatloads of malt and hops slammed together, yet coerced into a unified whole.  Stone has impressed the hell out of me again. While I don't believe that it rises to the heights of their beloved (in my case) IPA, I can recognize Arrogant Bastard Ale as yet another superb example of this brewery's brilliance. Am I worthy? Barely. Just barely.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Jables,4.2,"Pours a hazy mahogany with a thin off white head.  The aroma is citric hops, grapefruit, and dried fruits, dates and raisins.  Taste is big with slick piney hops, citrus fruit also some sweet caramel malt.  Moutfeel is full and heavy but perfect for the style.  Despite being apparently different styles, the entire time I drank this I was comparing it to Alpha King. Three Floyds and Stone I see as two premiere microbreweries in high demand. AB and AK are the two flagship brews so I subconciously was measuring the two against each other. While I really enjoyed this and would definitely buy it again, AK is better IMO.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,stewart124,4.5,A very dark copper color with a rusty head that is frothy to the extreme. The lacing is also very thick and entrancing. It's a very nice looking beer. The smell is almost more than one can handle with an aroma that smells of fruity hops and a malty alcohol scent. The taste is like nothing else with a huge hit of hops and malty character that blows your mind. This beer only gets better as it warms. Something that every beer lover must try. Not for the faint at heart.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,BeerBuilder,4.12,"Pours mohogany in color with a tan head. The aroma is citrusy, grapefruity, with a nice malt backbone. The flavor has a smooth maltiness throughout, with a citric grapefruit hop flavor. It has a somewhat creamy, oily mouthfeel, and it finishes dry and bitter.

147,92,Beervis,4.18,"Pours dark brown with a foamy off-white head. As the beer warmed up, the flavour really came out. I have my beer fridge set too high, and this is definitely a better beer when you drink it at the proper temperature. The aftertaste has a very strong hop presence, and has almost a grapefruit bitterness.  To add to the fun of enjoying this very drinkable beer, the writing on the back of the bottle is great!  What a great beer!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,filabrazilia,3.8,"Appearance - A cloudy dark carmel poured out of the bottle into my glass and formed a nice tan head. Excellent lacing was present throughout.  Aroma - Light malt and strong floral hops greeted the nose.  Taste - The hops absolutely dominated the flavor of this beer and had very little malt balance.  Mouthfeel - Lightly creamy in the mouth and fairly smooth. The hops obliterated the taste in the finish and left me with a slight pucker.  Drinkability - You want to keep drinking this one because anything else may seem bland after it. As I kept drinking, I suppose my taste buds got used to the flavor because it seemed to get better.  I liked this beer but not as much as the boasting on the bottle. I would definitely try this one again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Long lasting white head with a sticky lace that clings to the glass. Exceptional looking beer.  The nose was full of prunes, vanilla, alcohol, floral hops, citrus fruits and a malt undertone.  Sharp hops at first followed by flavors of prunes, apricots, caramel and light toffee. Hops are dominant but the malt presense is very high too and balances well. Hops still take over this beer and make it very bitter. Excellent mouthfeel as well.  All around an exceptional beer!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Medium-bodied sweet and toasted (even some smoke) malt to start, warm alcohol and crisp bubbling tingle at the top...then BAM!!, bitter-dry/citrus-crisp hop finish. Whew... incredible balance. Mouthfeel: Rich chewy, creamy malt. Carbonation is perfect size and level to compliment the taste. Soothing alcohol warmth. Drinkability: This brew lives up to the hype... thank the maker (ha ha) that this is now available in my area.

The nose is very malty/caramel, with some hints of hops. Taste contains some caramel and brown sugar, with some hops in the middle and a malty aftertaste. I remember this being more hoppy the last time I had it. What happened? This beer really reminds me of is a stronger version of Smuttynose Old Brown Dog. Maybe I'm just weird...

Its extreme hopiness, married with liberal alcohol, a nice sweet mid-taste. Pours dark brown with a sticky tan head. Hop aroma is evident as soon as you open the bottle. Toasted malt character, with a malty undertone. Theres a lot going on in the beer, but you have to pay attention and work through the dominant hops.dark, ripe fruit (cherry, plum), Oktoberfest sweetness, soft toasty-doughyness, and spice.

The head was good and it had a rich dark colour. There was a moderate malt aroma.  Had a moderate mouth feel.  I can not quite place the malt flavour and I am not sure of the hopping.

Nose is very well-balanced mixture of rich bready/caramelly malt and piney hops. Some earthy notes develop as it warms adding more complexity. Very nice.  Less well-balanced on the palate. The malt is there, but its fighting for its life against the hops. It holds its own into the midpalate, but then the piney, citric hops take over. The finish is very long and bitter, but its a quality, smooth bitterness.  Very good slightly creamy soft carbonation helps keep the hops in check. Surprisingly drinkable for style.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Weissenheimer,3.79,"My pint has a small head which leaves absolutely no lacing on the glass. The color is a dark, slightly reddish-brown. I hold it up to the light, which intensifies the redness and transforms it into a coppery amber. It smells strongly of very sweet grapefruit, even from an arm's length away. The scent carries another association for me, and eventually I drudge up the memory. I double- and triple-check. Yes, I most definitely smell those fuzzy navels of which I drank so many in college.  I take a swig and the fuzzy navel association ends. Pretty much all I'm tasting here is alcohol and grapefruit. I have lots of ideas about the other tastes, but it's almost impossible to listen to them over the shout of the grapefruit. So the following is mostly conjecture.  At first there is simply a strong acidic blast. The alcohol content is apparent at this stage. I keep wanting to say ""nutty"" but I believe it's just my tongue's astonished reaction as it reels from the shock of citric acid. Once it gets its bearings there is a huge grapefruit wallop followed by a tingling, acidic finish that's identical to what you'd get after taking a bite of - you guessed it - grapefruit. I think that there are some hops lurking in the background, but I'm not sure. And perhaps a little bit of... smokiness? Mesquite???  What's truly astounding here is that I like this beer. Despite my unending loathing for grapefruit, I like this. I've enjoyed drinking a few 22-ounce bottles of this and I know I'll do so again, but it's too strong for me to want to drink more than that at one sitting. Overall it's an enjoyable novelty, but in my opinion it's a bit more gimmicky than the bottle, with all its bragging, would like to admit.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Very good color and carbonation. The smell puts me off a bit, a little too fruity. Similar to a sweet wine. The taste and mouthfeel follow suit, a bit too fruity for me. Also a little rubber and Soy?  This bier gets very high marks and I will try it again at a later date in case I got a bad one. But as of now, I think it's a little overated.

This beer is hoppy, yet has a slightly sweet aftertaste. It definitely packs a punch. Not for the faint-hearted, for sure. I enjoy the taste so much I could drink this beer every day!

147,92,byrd,4.37,"Dark copper-brown in color with a very nice frothy, 3/4in head that has nice retention. The head is quite sticky, and holds to the sides of the glass. Slight haze is noticeable, but its tough to tell through the fairly dark color. Lots of malty caramel notes are noticeable during the pour. Once in the glass, the aroma of malts is still apparent, but hops stand out more - citrusy, grapefuity hop aromas that are quite clean and somewhat sweet. Nice smooth caramel maltiness up front. Then a bit of citric hops picks up with roasted notes being more noticeable towards the end. Roasted notes linger in the back of the mouth after the finish. Some sweet hop notes are also noticeable towards the end. The body is medium to full with not much carbonation, but the hop bite seems to make up for that. A slight hint of alcohol is noticeable, but doesnt hinder the flavor any. Nice brew, well balanced, and quite drinkable. Definitely lives up to its reputation.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Itlan,4.36,"As few months ago I would have rated this beer a 3.0 based on the amount of alcohol. What I've found over the summer is that this beer is extremely cravable. It does look great in the glass. You can always spot your Arrogant Bastard (ABA) in a crowd of beers.  The smell is distinctive and strong but not overwhelming. So far, just by sight and smell, you know it's going to be good. Taste, well on a hot day when you want to cool off, the taste is perfect. A strong thirst quenching ale. On a cold day, the first sip comes off as strong and it takes a couple to get re-introduced to the beer. In fact, you almost need someone to introduce you to your first ABA in order to fully appreciate the beer. I have found that ABA goes better with friends.  Mouthfeel - ABA hits the mouth hard at first. You know it's there and it sends the beer senses tingling. After the first sip, it just feels right.  Drinkability - well I'm a light-weight drinker but even I can power down two of these. Now a word of caution, ABA goes down well after drinking other types of beer but if you drink it first, other beers don't always work as followers. I find that ABA on tap is more drinkable than out of the bottle. It does pair well with food, especially the finger food sort.  My conversion came after attending the Stone 7th anniversary party this summer. After a few of these in the hot sun, I was converted to ABA. Enjoy!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,saltydog,4,"Appearence: Reddish amber color, very clear, big, foaming head when poured, which took quite some time to fade, leaving lace behind. Smell: Massively heavy hops. Some caramalt malt aroma is in the background if you look for it. Taste: a malty sweetness battles with a heavy resinous hop soup, and eventually loses out. Mouthfeel is tingly, with hop bitterness finishing out. Drinkability: An aggressive, memorable beer. I'm not really a big hophead, but this is very well-made and succeeds at what it aims for.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

While back in the day I loved stone IPA, but saw arrogant bastard a bit over the top and not quite as balanced, after picking it back up I must say I was wrong. If your pallette has been broken in to good IPA's, you will find the bitterness of this beer very refreshing and not overbearing. For you people who are thrown off by the bitterness, I asure you, there are other flavors here. A dash of caramel, a bit of fruitiness near the end, and the hint of spice interlaced with the hops that you come to expect from a good stone brew.

The aroma was good, with some hoppiness being the strong effect on the nose.This has a fantastic malt and hop balance that has your tastebuds wanting more.

Taste: Sharp, juicy hops at first, followed by dark, rich roasty malts. Finishes dry with a lingering hop bitterness. Alcohol is evident in the finish, nicely tying things up. But the hops, the beautiful hops, they linger . . . .   Notes: I first tried this about three years ago, and I definitely was *not* worthy.

147,92,faernt,4.58,"I just opened this beer and sat down to read the forum. I've had it before and bought more because it tastes good. Well I have to stop and review it now. It's an IPA but it's more. I went through a hophead phase and am now into the malt. the IPA scene doesn't speak to me. But this Arrogant Bastard does. This beer is hoppy! It's also sweet and bitter and thick. It smells bittersweet. OK it's the bittersweet taste that makes this beer so beguiling.  It's well-made. It has a beautiful head that, if poured roughly, becomes somewhat rocky. The small bubbled head creates irregular lace down the glass. I am using a chalice. The dark copper color is very clear.The smell is hoppy but then the bittersweet comes into play. Is this one playing with unfermentables as a primary influence? I'm no homebrewer but it makes me want to know why this beer works this way. There is body here. I suppose I should call it mouthfeel but it is so substantial. It is attractive. I bought it again because it continued to remind me of how complex a beer can be.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,beernbbq,4.5,Probably one of the best of its ilk. Delicious all the way around from the hops on top to the sweet malt and the heady alcohol. Sort of a HopDevil on steroids.

147,92,cerevisiaephilus,4.23,"This beer certainly belongs in the ranks with SN's Celebration and Rogue's Santa's Special Reserve. It is a large beer, bigger than either of these two I think. Huge hops that sit solidly on a massive malt edifice make for a very enjoyable beverage all around. However more than a couple of these from the 22oz bottles make appreciating them fairly difficult.  Very cool bottle as well.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Aroma consists of citrusy hops, malt, some dark fruit, dark rum and has a sweetness to it. Medium-bodied mouthfeel. A firm bitterness is present throughout. Nice caramel malt background. Hop bitterness and malt flavor seem to balance each other out rather well. Warming alcohol effect is noticed as the ale goes down. Excellently crafted.

Aroma: Largely of thick, toasted malts complimented by citrusy, piney hops.  Taste: Fierce, toasted, caramel malts upfront and throughout; heavy, aggressive hop bitterness in the finish; sweet; notes of toffee, grapefruit and pine; faint overtones of cherry-like fruits. Medium thick body; smooth-to-chewy mouthfeel.  Notes: Absolutely delicious. Great beer worthy of me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Somewhat small head, though it has beautiful lace and quite remarkable retention.  Smell: Hops, hops and more hops. fantastic smell, with many beautiful estery notes and a trace hint of the alcohol that lies within.  Taste: Medium bodied, with a very nice mouthfeel. The malty sweetness is quite inviting, and then overthrown by the aggressive hops. Slightly dry finish leaving hints of grains and malt sweetness, and of course the unforgettable hoppiness on the back of your tongue.  Overall: Fantastically complex brew, and quite fantastic overall. I can't imagine drinking a ton of this beer, it's certainly not a session brew.

Taste is wow some fruit, definetly has hops, chocolate or carmel malts, a smokey taste as well and a hint of alcohol. The mouth feel was smooth with a slight carbonation, medium bodied but very good. I could drink a sixer of this stuff but after 3 I'll probably be shit faced to the max, very good stuff.

The aroma is rather mild, it has some spiciness to it, but is fairly unimpressive. Nice complex taste--some spiciness, but also tastes of sweet malt, bitter hops, and fruit. Becomes more flavorful as it warms and the complexity really comes out. A very good tasting beer.

147,92,BrewDoctor,4.04,"After a nice 5 mile run through Central Park, I decided to head over to the Gingerman for a few new beers. Unfortunately, no buddies were around so it was a solo trip. After reviewing the menu extensively, the Stone products caught my eye as I have a hard time finding them in CT.  After all the hype, I settled on the Arrogant Bastard for my introduction and man - it was like a surprise party! I didn't have a pen and paper so this is from memory... which may have been altered after 20 oz. of this beast.  Bastard has a beautiful deep amber color dominated by red highlights. The appearance is smooth and the modest, lightly colored head fades quickly.  After 3 attempts to seize the aroma of this brew, I came up with a blank each time. I simply didn't smell anything. Hell, maybe I was a bit stuffed up that day, but usually the sniffer is pretty good. Either way, I prefer to drink a beer through my mouth.  Wow ... Hops! Tasty, fresh, lovely, hops! At first, it takes control of your mouth and leaves little room for other flavors. Be patient, the caramel malt flavor creeps out to balance the hop explosion. Overall, the flavor and mouthfeel are wonderful.  This beer is definitely not for the weak. Its powerful and aggressive in taste and ABV. After 20 oz and a 5 mile, run  this brew went straight to my head.  A great brew that I look forward to enjoying again in the future.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,RoyalT,4.73,"Appearance  Simply gorgeous. The deep, shiny brown flavor held some ruby coloring, and the brownish head built well (not overly so), and went down sensually.  Smell  The hops come out right away in this one. They are raw and aggressive, as if they are still in the ground. Theres a hint of something fruity as well, although I wasnt able to make it out. Its very sugary, like a carrot or maybe something man made (perhaps highly refined table sugar).  Taste  How did I not pick up the malt in the nose? I assumed that I was in for an unbalanced hop attack, yet the balance is amazing. This is unbelievable!  This one is a perfect mix of hops, malts, fruits, and sugars, and boy are they big. Theres a ton of fun in this bottle. The aromatic floral hops are evenly complimented by quality malts, sugars, and about a hundred different fruits. You could spend all day calling these ones out.  Mouthfeel  Little carbonation but a fine, smoothy foaminess on the cheeks. This one is very lively, yet not overpoweringly so.  Drinkability  I cant stop drinking this beer.  Comments  Im sure that itll label me the green newbie with his eyes caught in the headlights, but Im falling all over myself drinking this beer. This will replace my cocaine/crack/tobacco/heroin/pot/obsessive-compulsive knuckle-cracking habits all at once. Why would I hit the pipe when I could tap the Bastard?  Seriously, this one is astounding. These guys have to be Stone crazy. The oak-aged Arrogant Bastard reviews certainly have my interest at this point.

147,92,brakspear,4.85,"What a beer. Not for the faint of heart, but the label should have scared timid beer drinkers aways anyway. This beer poured a dark amber and brown body with a chewy thick tan head. The nose is a blast of thick dripping malt, toasted, caramel, biting, smokey, with a nice citrus hop snap. The flavors are full bodied, roasted malt flavors with a nice balancing faint sweetness, which is then slammed by a slicing hop bitterness.

147,92,Boilermaker88,3.63,"Served on tap at Heroe's Bar & Grill, La Verne, CA  Really good-looking beer - deep, dark amber color with sticky tan head and nice lace.  Smell: pretty good blending of sweet caramel maltiness, hints of plums or raisins, and a citrusy, piney aroma.  Taste: Initial taste is a sweet...holy crap!...hops, hops, hops! Just like my pint glass and the bottles say, this is an aggressive beer. I had about two seconds to try and sort things out before the hops booby-trap exploded on my tongue. I was immediately seized by a strong citrusy - grapefruit, peel and all - blast of hops. There was a vague pine taste also and an alcohol astringency that showed up as I swallowed. Long on bitterness, short on sweet.  Feel was medium bodied, somewhat slick.  This beer is best as a sipping beer, IMO. Rather unbalanced taste will appeal to hops-lovers. The alcohol content is pretty well masked and could really sneak up on the unwary drinker. This is an intense beer that really grabs you by your tastebuds. Arrogant Bastard Ale fires a veritable artillery barrage of hops at the drinker. Not the first beer I'd aim at a person who only drinks macros.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Capped with a dense off white head, perfect two fingers in height. Amazing head retention.  Yes, as a matter a fact I do smell some hops!  Down the hatch. Notes of caramel, toffee, and a touch a plum. Astringent hop loaded finish, with pine flavors wraping it up tight. Enough malt sweetness is left to keep the hops from running completely wild. But it clear that the hops are definitely in control.  Medium - full bodied. Unique, and enjoyable.

A thick malty sweetness with touches of smoke, caramel, milk chocolate, hints of meat, and even some slight citrus smells.  The taste was full bodied with a huge sharp citrus peel hop punch. Almost astringent and metalic. But a very tight hop bitterness with touches of a spicy soft black pepper. Very bitter. Lots of dark roasted bitter malt flavors. Coffee, caramel, wood, earth.  It then ended with this very very very long bitterness that took it's time to finish.  Basically the label says it all, this is an aggressive beer. So very bitter and complex.

The brew poured a ruby red with a nice one inch tan head. Lace was very nice. The aroma was of light hop, grass and malt background. Taste is a surprise hop overtone bonanza. Very slight malt to balance this very smooth and drinkable brew. The mouth is left tart but moist, not a dry beer. Hop lingers on in the aftertaste. A very well-done, well-crafted brew.

The scent is strong malty dark caramel. Some fruit bite and a toasted finish. Soak in the scents. Many to be had.  Flavors are numerous and bold. Burnt chocolate and roasted dark coffee. Caramel and then if that is not enough? Here come the deep floral hops to grab your taste buds and take them for a spin. The flavors of this ale take you on a journey. There is an alcohol essence but it only ads to the ride.  A nice medium bold mouthfeel. It drinks well. There is a bite feeling to this ale. I truly enjoyed the bite.

This is very hoppy & very malty all at once. Hops dominate the taste but there is definitely a nice & tasty strong malt backbone holding everything up and somewhat balancing things, which is pretty amazing considering how hoppy this brew is. There is also a very welcome alcohol warmth here. This is a hop lover's meat & potatoes beer. Nice silky mouthfeel and incredibly drinkable.

Holy smokes, this beer looks good. A deep, coppery red colour with a thick head. Smelled very hoppy. Whoa. Also detected some floral hops, pine, a little citrus and barley malt. Tastes great. When this beer enters your mouth, the tongue is hit with a complex mosaic of malts, citrus, smoke and alcohol. When it leaves through the throat, that sweetness becomes a bitter taste, as if the hops are making their final stand. Heavy mouthfeel. It's a bit thick, sort of like watered down syrup. For this beer, that's a good thing. Drinkable in that yes, I shall be drinking this again. And again. And again. But at one sitting, any more than three would seem too much.

Maple and brown sugar malts, an almost scorched pine Chinook-style hop turns up the juice mid mouth to close -- with alcoholic punctuation. Very well done medium carbonation and mouthfeel.

147,92,cokes,4.65,"A blurred cherrywood river rages through its channel, spitting ample khaki froth. Rich toffee malts and pine hops scents accompany the rushing water. Black cherries and rum-soaked pineapple provide fascinating olfactory flourishes.  The dam bursts as a massive wall of liquid caramel rushes forward. Coating and blanketing sweetness, but not sticky. The tsunami rushes past orange groves, stripping the peels clean off the fruits. The wall of malt-laden water gains speed and attains a buttery diacetyl within its depths. The wave consumes pineapple plantations and ravishes cherry orchards. In its wake resides a sense of twisted, charred strawberries.  Down the road, the civilians pile hop-sandbag after hop-sandbag, in preparation for the ensuing blast. Pine boards are hammered up against all windows and doors. Resinious anticipation.  It works.  The fluid malten beast smashes against the hoppy barriers and is pushed back. At the crux, lightly roasty nougat clashes with a pink grapefruit bitterness . Neither one giving way. A stand still. No advances made. No property lost, and just a few alcoholic ripples reach town.. An upswell of vanilla-tinged celebration ensues.  A complicated situation, it was. A test of malt heft versus hoppy assertion culminating in perfectly heavy, splendidly carbonated, and ultimately consumable collision.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,FranklinPCombs,4.31,"this brew pours a beautiful deep reddish brown, with a thick tan head. It leaves a nice thick lace which remains at the top of the glass by the end of the pint. The smell is immediately fruity, mostly pineapple, with just a hint of hops and malt to complement, and a strong undertone of pure alcohol. The smell, I soon learned, was no indication of what the taste was to be. THe first sip was wonderfully smooth, with a smaller, yet fitting, amount of carbonation. the first taste sensation was a sharp alcoholic bitter, which although hoppy, seemed to include something more, which i find myself unable to pinpoint. the bitter immediately reaches a high point, and there it plateaus, remaining for a long time, while more subtle flavors begin to appear. a burnt earthy flavor lingers behind the bitterness, while a general hint of fruityness makes itself apparent. as the pint progresses, the bitter simply refuses to abate, and after finishing this glass, i think i could rightly call myself an Arrogant Bastard",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Mitchster,3.93,"Clear dark-mahogany in color, forming a whipped, sticky beige head atop small bubbles with superior retention and lacing. Aroma is spicy with citric hops, big-time apricot, deep amber malts, deisel exhaust, black permanent marker, and methane (?!). Carbonation is mild to moderate with a suprisingly smooth mouthfeel and heavy, syrupy body. Taste begins with intense piney hops. The malts are rather soft and a bright, acidic moderately bitter finish of resinous hops is offset by a large amount of dryness and retained vanilla. Alcohol is briefly noted with some mild residual sugars and very slight fusels in the finish. I was expecting some dark fruits here, but didn't find any. The initial taste is very pleasing, but the longer you let the finish hang in your mouth, the more bitter and unpleasant it becomes, hampering it's drinkability.  A spicy, well-crafted brew, but lacking of enough finesse to make it very drinkable. Still, when you're in the mood for a Stone brew, you can rely on them like a hammer to the head.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,vitesse,2.04,"the beer looks nice and the bottle tries hard to stand out, but that's about all i like about this beer. the hops are just so overbearing that it left me with a muddy/earthy flavor in my mouth. have you ever smelled plain ole raw hop pellets before used for brewing? that's what this beer tastes like. there's absolutely no malty sweetness to balance it out either. yeah it masks the alcohol well, but so what? this beer is just so gimmicky to me. hops are great for adding bitterness and aroma, but this beer uses way too much of them.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,hotstuff,3.3,"Yikes! Talk about hops! When this brew was poured into my glass, it poured with a large tan head that was fairly long lasting and there were fine-large bubbles. The body hue was dark brown and there was a little bit of carbonation observed. The first whiff of this brew reminded me of pineapples. From the first taste to the last taste of this brew it was constantly a strong bitter tasting brew that I did not enjoy very much.

It pours a nice reddish brown with a two finger, off white head. Very strong nose full of hops, pine needles, fruit (pineapple?), and malts. Truly awe-inspiring!  The hops in this one hit you over the head like a runaway tractor trailer. NOT for the weak! Excellent, full bodied, highly potent flavors just as bold as the hop character, but very enjoyable. Alcohol is noticeable, but not unpleasant. It should A smooth drinking brew, but rather strong for an extended session beer, unless you don't mind crawling on your knees!

147,92,assurbanipaul,4.32,"Pours a tawny brown with a healthy moderate tan head. Aroma is rich and caramelly with a sharp orangey hop bite already.  Taste is immediately a rush of malt and hops, filling the whole flavor spectrum. Malts are dark caramel, roasty, strong and a little on the sweet side. Hops ride proudly alongside the malts, not bright and happy like an IPA but smokey and dark with hints of citrus and chipotle. Finish is dry and grainy, almost cigar-like.  Mouthfeel is medium but drinkable with an acidic bite on the tongue. Not quite quaffable due to its strength -- not just alcoholic strength but just strong, pushy, aggressive flavors. This one makes you sit up and notice it.  Edit: Rating upgraded on draft sample. The freshness really comes through in a long-weekend hop-fest in your mouth. I felt the sides of my throat pucker like sucking on a sour candy. Not just hype or a gimmick, this beer really does make you stand up and respect it.  Mixed emotions about the drinkability, though.

The taste was quite hoppy like an IPA, but somehow much more than that. The mouthfeel seemed a bit heavy, but not to the point of a stout. As for drinkability, I would gladly have another, and another, and another......  This was served on the hour, every hour, and without fail there was a line 5-10 minutes before, even though most had had the beer before. The Bastard had fallen off the Top 50 for a while, but I'm glad to see it back as this is truly one of the great beers of the American microbeer revolution.

Play on words there to describe what the head does to the glass, ""sticks"" & ""hangs"". Over the top scent of hops, over the top taste of hops. Hops with perhaps toasted malt and caramel and some spuce-like undertones. A very strong malt backbone holds this beer together and it does a damn fine job. This is a aggressive beer, somewhat of a bittersweet symphany.

Overall a great beer that kinda makes you want to be an arrogant bastard.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I could just sit here and smell this all day were it not for my desire to drink it so badly.  It poured a very dark brownish amber with a creamy tan head that's still slightly present halfway down the glass. Mouthful is substantial. Smooth yet aggressive, rich malt flavors followed by extreme bitter hops and a nice alcohol warmth. A little on the harsh side with raw hops, but I can't say I wasn't warned..",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,PhantomVodoo,4.12,"Dark amber in color. This pint had very minimal tan head. A better head and appearance would have scored 4.5. Nice aroma mostly of floral hops. Malts and fruitiness underneath.  Nice level of bitterness to the taste. Big, sweet malt backbone with a toasty, caramel character. Floral hops chime in nicely. I'm torn between giving the taste a 4.0 or 4.5. Depends on my mood I guess. Sometimes I really enjoy this beer, while sometimes I think the taste is a bit too bitter.  Good mouthfeel. Plenty of body. Good drinkability.  Overall, a good beer with lots of character. I'm puzzled why I hadn't managed to review this one on BA yet.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

I was suspecting an overpowering hops aroma and taste, but was pleasantly surprised. The hops were in the forefront in both the nose and the tongue, but the malt characteristics were not left out. The bitterness started the taste and clung to the tongue a long time after the beer had been swallowed. The mouthfeel was moderate with a fair amount of carbonation. It was probably the hops and not the bubbles that tickled the tongue.

Because the bottle told me that ""You're not worthy"" and well, I really like a challange!  This thing pours a dark red/brown, with a nice head that slowly recedes. The aroma was very malty with very noticable hops mixed in there. After the first taste, for a minute there I really though that they were right, and I wasn't worthy, but then the flavors really started to came out.

After an initial smell and taste a few people readily came to mind that fit the description of this Ale. Bombastic, arrogant, however all of those people are lacking the intricacy that Stone Brewing has accomplished with this beer. The head was thick, foamy resembling the color of coffee with cream just added. The only clear part of the body of the beer was right at the base of the glass. The rest had a substantial, murky, red cloud hanging. The smell was infinitely complex with such varied aromas as coffee, HUGE hops, grapefruit and toffee interweaving. The taste watered my mouth, leaving me wanting more. It was super hoppy with a big robust citrus flavor and some more subtle smoked notes mixed in. Although the appearance was not as spectacular as the Bigfoot the taste was far more refined, truly being able to claim the name Arrogant.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,jlervine,4.18,"A few weeks ago, I drove from Atlanta to Chattanooga to obtain some &gt; 6% abv beers - a few trappists, some Stone Brewing Co. beers, and basically whatever else I could find and possible afford. I went up there with a $50 limit to my purchases, and came back with $150 worth of beer. What can I say, I am weak. Nevertheless, the 5 hour trip netted a few choice brews. This is one of them.  So I finally get around to drinking an Arrogant Bastard. I figure, a beer named after what people tend to call me has to be fantastic, right?  AB poured a nice crystal clear amber with a thick creamy head. Bready aromas and hops - almost a piney or cut-grass smell - rose up from my glass. The taste followed suit - very piney and green - methinks I should have aged this bottle for a few months. Big on hops. Big on malt, once you look past the hops.

This ale poured a clear, red-amber color with tall, creamy, tan foam that left lace on the pint glass. The smell was biscuity (bread) with citrus, malt, floral hops aromas. There was a crispness to the smell. The taste was dominated by malt sweetness, but with floral hops, oak, grapefruit, pine, some aromatic tastes, and a bit of caramel thrown in. The mouthfeel was smooth but crisp with a hoppy astringency. The body was medium and so was the carbonation. This is a very drinkable strong ale.

Medium-bodied and tart, with flavors of citrus, caramel, malt and pine.

147,92,Dantes,4.47,"Presentation: ~10oz. from draught in a tulip glass at The Blind Tiger&#8217;s Stone 12 event. Cost: $5.  Appearance: Hard to distinguish from the Double Bastard and lighter than the oak-aged version. A beer that shows its lovely red-amber color very nicely in the glass. Capped with a medium-thick ½&#8221; of foam, which lasted very nearly through the glass.  Smell: An aroma leaning more heavily toward the hoppy end of the spectrum, while still displaying a nice fruity, malty scent.  Taste: The alcohol seemed more prevalent in the AB than the DB, which surprised me. Perhaps it was the thinner body and more dominant hops. Somehow avoided becoming medicinal as some highly-hopped beers sometimes do. Less well-balanced and sharper than the DB, but exhibited a greater degree of spice.  Mouthfeel: Not as creamy as the Double Bastard, it is still a warming, smooth beer that fills the mouth with a nice effervescence that carries the wide range of flavors.  Drinkability: Nicely drinkable. Clean, hoppy, and refreshing; while providing a boatload of flavor and deeper, malty notes.  I hesitate to call this &#8220;Double Bastard Lite,&#8221; but in a sense, this is what it is. This by no means is intended to be derogatory. The AB sacrifices some body and malt in the interest of providing a lower ABV. A noble goal that! I go back and forth as to which one I prefer and have decided that I probably lean toward the DB, but I wouldn&#8217;t turn this down. I do find the hops a bit more oppressive here, but this only results in a more refreshing, cleaner beer. I urge you find out for yourself! This is one of the few highly-hopped beers I truly enjoy, falling closer to the Sierra Nevada Celebration than Rogue&#8217;s 60-Minute IPA or Stone&#8217;s own Ruination.

This color is just breathtaking. The pour gives a good 1 finger of head, that fades away to a small line very slowly, and leaves a fair amount of lace down the glass as I drink it. The smell wasn't what I expected. It had a sweet fruitiness to it, which was very pleasantly mixed with hop aroma. The taste starts off sweet, with a bite of citrus, grapefruit I'm thinking. The finish is all hops, but not too bitter. This is a beer that is in perfect malt/hop harmony. I really love it. The mouthfeel is a little soft for a strong ale though.

147,92,JohnnyDuvel,4.15,"Well, I finally got to try my first Stone beer (thanks, Ron), and it was, at the same time, predictable and unpredictable. Predictable in the sense that every overly hyped micro ale I have tried is way too hopped (ie Rogue, Victory). Unpredictable in the sense that it is darker and maltier than I expected. Wonderful, citrus smell entices you (much like the Rogue IPA). Pours beautiful. Dark, mohogany hue, nice head, and impressive lacing. Then you take a sip. Hops. Hops. After a while, the malty notes appear. It is certainly a complex beer, but the bitterness just is too dominant to let any other characteristic (particularly that nice citrus taste that's hiding in there) truly appear. It seems that the only way an American micro-ale can get attention these days is to go nuts with hops. I followed this (and the Rogue IPA) with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, and I don't care if people lined up from here to California to swear on the Stone and Rogue, the Sierra is a better beer (IMHO).  (1/2/09) Oh, how foolish we are when we are just learning! The Bastard is one of the best (and most unique) American ales I've had - and I like the Oak even a little better.

This is my kinda beer. Big, rich, full, dark, and flavor packed--especially in bittering qualities. Notes of grapefruit, lemon, bittersweet spices, etc overwhelm the taste buds. Mellowing carmel malts take some off this bastards bite, but it is still one mean beer. Warming yet fitting for a nice spring day...one bomber is all thats needed to take the stress of four classes off my mind. With that in mind Im gonna cut this review short.

As I quaffed this nectar plenty of sticky lace was produced. The nose is a magnificent blend of sweet caramel malts and very assertive hops. The aroma has great potency. The invitation of the bouquet accurately portrays what awaits the palate; plenty of critic/grapefruit notes, pleasantly harsh, bitter. Oh yeah the hops govern or so it seems! The sweet caramel malts are not forgotten. The alcohol stands alone, stark naked, and imposing in its manhood. The forwardness is well conceived and adds tremendous complexity and enjoyment. The lingering acidicness and bitterness begs your senses to take another sip and I gladly did. It is almost full-bodied, ideally firm carbonated. This is a perfectly powerful quaff.

Hops of course are the dominant flavor, so tart and bitter, but they also become fruity and bolster the caramel sweetness from the malts. Still if you don't like bitter beers you probably won't enjoy this. I like them generally, and enjoyed this beer, but a growler is perhaps too much of a good thing. Also the hop bitterness aroused my appetite (as hoppy beers are wont to do), but when it came time to eat something my taste buds were completely stripped from the beer.

In short, you know that this shit will take the paint off the side of your house.  The taste is like a piece of some crazy candy that a lot of kids eat -- extreme! With kids, it might be a sour gumball that starts sweet and then destroys you with overwhelming sourness. In the case of this beer, it starts malty sweet and then just LEVELS you with hop bitterness. Frankly, I don't think the flavor is terribly complex. It's just an intentional exercise in extremism, which is fine -- but almost by definition cannot really be exceptional.  My friend and fiancee, both beer drinkers, couldn't stomach their portion of the 22oz bottle. And they're both pretty tolerant (even loving!) of beers with a lot of flavor. In this case, however, they couldn't drink it. It's a bit extreme to be drinking in significant quantities.

Nose was of cherries that settled into grapes, a faint floral hops scent almost near pine, and some small notes of oak and cedar. All was softly blended together.  Taste was a little complex, or at least hard to make your way through - Stone hops are often a jungle that hides all other flavors. First things first, the hops were lightly salty and a little bready, and then turned grapefruity. A calm, quiet, but solid barleywine malt body came through as the beer opened and my tongue adjusted to the high IBU level.  Had a moderate length finish, with a surprisingly quiet aftertaste for what is, at first taste, an aggressive beer. The mouthfeel was oily, but soon after the swallow the hops went to work coating my mouth with a very soft dryness.

The spicy aroma lept of the top of the glass to my nose and I think my nose actually puckered. The taste is great, a little bitter to consume too much, but the variety of flavors that mix with that definite hop make it an experience to not pass up. A fairly strong beer, which is detectable really in the taste.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,ElGuapo,4.67,"The bastard and I enjoyed a 6 hour ride home together. We then sat down, both tired and a little cranky at 1:30 in the morning after a great long weekend with a total of 12-13 hours of driving. I poured the bastard into a glass, and he punched me in the face with an intense hop aroma. His deep dark amber appearance covered in a pillow of off-white foam was not quite as tough as his bite.  I take a swallow, and the bastard hits me again. This time right below my rib cage in the kidneys. It appears that this bastard is herre to make an impression and give me a beating. A load of hops comes with the blow. I am engulfed in masses of body and flavor. He is up in my face as I unleash a burp, and he then realizes his own strength. I breathe out and have a grassy, spicy taste, almost like chewing on hops. The bastard backs away thinking that I possess the intense hop character that he does. It gives me time to shoot in for another gulp of the delicious nectar. Another blow from the bastard nearly knocks me out of my chair with flavors that are out of this world. On and on the battle goes until I eventually finish this wonderful brew.  I cannot really call it a battle because it was wonderful to drink. However, a beer like the bastard may want to remain unopened and untasted to just stare down those who wish to consume him.  This is simply one of the finest brews I have ever had. It is so intense with flavor and aroma. Very full of body with hops that could make many men cry. I cannot wait to meet with this one again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jeffboo,4.26,"Hops...check! Malt....check! Flavor for days....check! This one's got em all. A beer for all occasions. This one pours dark amber with big,thick tan head bursting with citrus hops- grapefruit rind and ripe oranges with a touch of earthy hop resin for good measure. It has a thick, heavy texture that is surprisingly easy to drink. The hop/malt balance is nice, sweet malt with a citrus hop flavor that finishes toasty with a smooth hop bitterness. It doesn't have a very complex malt flavor but more a base to hold complex hop flavor and bitterness.It is a bit heavy but enough fun by itself to quaff a few with snacks. A great beer to have around year round.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,stirgy,4.73,"I finally get to try the bastard. I was surprised when I found a case of this. (Bells Beverage in South Philly) I was a little worried of this beer because it seemed to be a bit hyped up. (catchy name and packaging) To my surprise this beer wasnt overrated at all. Its excellent! It poured out a bright and clear ruby-orange and had a very dense and cream-like head. Nice malty aroma comes through right beside a beautiful citrus and lively hop note.  I found this a very drinkable and tasty ale. Alcohol comes through in the aftertaste, but doesnt overwhelm. Bitterness is very pleasant and appealing.  Excellent  and dangerous  Im halfway through this beer and I am feeling it already. Nice! =)",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Reidrover,4.55,"Ok at long last I get around to reviewing this beer..I have had it before but never in front of the computer..were I tend to do all my reviews. I bought it in the ubiquitous 22 oz bomber""You're not worthy"" we shall see about that!! well with the look of the brew I am already impressed somewhat..nice dark ruby red colour in the light ..a large tan head forms and disintigrates into a lovelly thick clinging lace. MMM great aroma here..its really complex though the malts and the hops do go well together in the ""bouquet"".. i also smell coffee ..chocolate.. very well done. Takes a big gulp well my goodness this is some mouthful of flavour!..the malt is present..but is overwhelmed by the hops..in between there is a bunch of chocolaty , coffee flavours..with a touch of liquorice here too..yet in the background there are more fruity accents..great stuff indeed. Fells 100% right to my palate.. cant think of anything wrong with it.  For a 7.2% beer this is exceptionally drinkable..but be careful\  Well i took the challenge..but somehow I doubt that i am worthy!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Scooter77,4.42,"This is one helluva great brew. Pours a deep orangish/reddish/brown color with a moderately frothy off-white head, which leaves a thin, sticky lace. The aroma is definitely not for the faint of heart. A healthy punch of hops attacks the olfactory senses, leaving them begging for mercy. Slight aromas of fruit and alcohol are also detected. The bold taste of hops will beat down your taste buds and have them screaming Uncle. This is one vastly complex brew, I didnt think that anyone could put that much hops into one beer. Am I worthy? Why, yes I am.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Shiredave,4.8,"Damn this stuff is good! For a hop head like myself, this beer approaches perfection. Slightly hazy, deep ruby color with slow, lazy trickles of carbonation. Frothy, pale tan head that left thick, clumpy lace at the top of the glass. Strong aromas of citrusy hop and fresh wort sweetness and ....more stuff. Initial flavors of juicy plums and cherries with maple and brown sugary grain that quickly blends easily with intense hop flavors of fresh oranges and ground pepper. This beer is aggressivly and arrogantly hopped yet still achieves just amazing balance. The strong, bitter finish is softened by left over roasty sweetness that makes you suck at the roof of your mouth to suckle every drop. I can honestly say I enjoyed this bottled version just as much ( tho, side by side taste test would be cool) the draft I sampled at the now infamous Blind Tiger 12, 12 @ 12 NYC Stone event. Now... the oak aged Arrogant Bastard.....that was a special thing indeed.  17 years later....... another 22oz bomber. L: 4.75 S: 4.25 T: 4.25 F: 4.25 O: 4.5 = ? (4.45) Looks amazing - deep red -amber color , super clear with a dense, nearly tan head of foam that completely blanketed the inside of the glass with thick lace. Aroma was more molasses and stone fruit with some C hop pine and a touch of roasted licorice. Taste was arrogant and less balanced than even recent examples- bittering is harsh even for an AB. Still tasty with hefty dark and caramel malt body and richness. Still the King and Gatekeeper of Worthiness.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,cretemixer,4.43,"Cola colored with a thick, light tan head. Hangs in at about 1/4 inch leaving a clingy lace. There is a resinous pine aroma that is trying to drown out the earthy sweet malts. Taste opens up with a deep roasted maltiness with caramel characteristics. These are joined by an incredible hop bitterness. The resinous pine aroma is no fluke...It's there in the taste too. Awesome balance. Slightly sticky full body that just forces you to drink more and more. I'm so thankful to Gusler for the trade and even happier that I willl be seeing this in stores near me real soon. What a beer!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Mick,5,"This is one very good beer. Raw and unleashed. Stone seems to making a splash in the NY area. Had this one on tap at dba recently. Great copper/red tint color. Thin white lace followed-up the quickly dissipating head. Did I mention raw and unleashed! Real hoppy, sound malt presence. A unique beer definitely. I look forward to having this one again as well as trying other Stone products. If you are a fan of strong beers you must add this one to your list of regulars.  Yes, it does earn a five.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Lightly carbonated and smells of a hint of spicy fruitiness. Bold sweet maltiness balanced out well with a hop bite that's like the smell, fruity and spicy but realllly bold. Mouthfeel reminds me of a liqueur. I loved this.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

147,92,MJR,4.6,"Appearance: Pours a pretty reddish color with perfect clarity. A tan head starts out big, shrinks to a respectable cap, and leaves lots of lace down the side of the glass.  Smell: Incredible aroma of fresh hops...it's raw, spicy, and pungent with lots of grapefruit and pine. A touch of sweet malt hides deep underneath the hop blitzkrieg.  Taste: This brew has a solid backbone of malt that comes across as caramelly, fruity, and slightly roasted. But that foundation gets beat down by a huge bitchslap of bitter hops. Flavors of pine, citrus, and grapefruit commit 3rd degree assault on my tastebuds, and I love every precious drop! There's a nice dose of alcohol in here as well. The hop flavor turns into a faint, burnt character on the tail end. Amazing...  Mouthfeel: Very full-bodied with a slighty, syrupy mouthfeel. Finishes with a dry edge from the alcohol.  Drinkability: To be honest, I'd love to drink this all night, but I'd really pay the price in the morning.

147,92,Denali,4.63,"On tap at Mug&#8217;s Ale House in Brooklyn, NY.  Appearance: Beautiful clear mahogany. Off white head.  Smell: Strong hops and citrus.  Taste: Hops, citrus, hops, more hops. Also tasted some hops in there as well. Did I forget to mention hops? Glorious hops flavor. I also tasted an outdoorsy leafy taste in there as well (hop leaves, or maybe just the character of the hops themselves?). But a beer cannot live by hops alone. The hops are extremely well balanced by the malt flavors. Wonderful bitter aftertaste. Very strong tasting. Outrageous! Yowsa!  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated.  Drinkability: Extremely drinkable. Definitely packs a wallop but so good. I would drink this till the end of time.  Comments: Life is good. Stone is now available in NY. Oh those hops.

147,92,Darkale,4.4,"Others have commented on the marvelous images and smart-ass comments on the bottle; what's inside is even better.  Beer is a dark orange-red in color, with a full, deep, thick tan head that doesn't want to quit. Very resilient; the most tenacious lacing I've ever seen.  Aroma is sharp grapefruit with a background of general citrus tones; and the taste brings out a nearly automatic, ""Wow."" A burst of fruit, a slightly gritty yet very creamy mouthfeel. Great hops in the middle of your mouth, then sweet, malty, with a hint of chocolate and roast coffee, and ending with citrus.  Every sip seems different, and the 750 ml size allows you to experience the different tastes as the beer warms up.  I have been told that this is similar to Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale, and I love SN Celebration; but, to me, there is no contest. If SN Celebration is a cottage, this is a mansion. More complicated than SN Celebration. More demanding. A glorious beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The beer itself is a beautiful garnet color. The nose is piney hops with underlying sweetness. The front is a slap-in-the face, bitter piney taste but this gives way to a full, sweet, malty middle (not that the hops go away, mind you). The finish is a lingering, strong, bitter, alcholic hop dream. Major cream and chocolate push through at temperature. This is just an amazing, hoppy, malty, creamy, classic concoction.

The hops are more than throwing themselves at you in the aroma, in addition to the full, reddish brown malty body. There is a subtle carbonation that makes the effect of the alcohol stand out more. A full bodied malt backbone hold up the powerful addition of hops, and a bit of a caramel sweetness that accompanies it.

147,92,scottum,4.68,What's better than a 22oz bottle of Arrogant Bastard? Finding Arrogant Bastard on tap! Sunset Bar and Tap in Allston had this on tap. I actually did not see it on the menu the first few times I looked because it is in the Amber Ale section. This is not an amber! anything that is a redish brown can not be an amber. The bartender told me that they stuck it there because they couldn't figure out where to put it. This beer is too good for clasification! Gotta love them hops!,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,SamuraiJack,3.96,"Wow! This is a SERIOUS ale. Huge, almost overwhelming flavours in a large bottle - a beer to share or a beer to drink when you need something beyond, over the edge - almost coarse in all ways. Arrogant is right. First pour shows a gorgous burgundy/ruby brown with a creamy and yet frothy lace that perfectly coats the glass. Bringing your nose over the glass exposes you to a blast of bananna, alcohol and rough grains and hops. It's almost enough to cause the eyes to water! The flavours are huge, with sweet malts fighting it out with the toast, caramel and fruity esters. The alcohol rises up in a burst of hops to bite back. While the malt is dominant, it is balanced by the sweet caramel and grains. This is a beer that you're either going to love or hate. It's uncompromising in all ways.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

On the nose the aromas of toasted grains, fruity esters, and the alcohol is evident as well. Mouthfeel is smooth.

The aroma is filled with an agressive hop aroma, some sweet maltiness, and a great aroma of figs or other fruits. The beer has a great fullness to it and the first sip is nice and thick almost chewy. A very upfront somewhat abrasive bitterness is complemented with the sweetness of the fruit flavors and malt. An awesome brew very well done, in fact it is a go to. This beer complements food better than most beers, the Bastard is amazing. My complements to the brewers at Stone!!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,beernut7,4.5,A thin lace sits upon a deep dark brown body. The aroma of heavy hopping is very inviting and reflects well on the brews name.

The distinguishing characteristic of chocolate malt pushes through the hoppiness and is supported heavily by a smooth thick body. Very complex and powerful.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,kunzbrew,4.5,"WOW, this brew pours a rich copper color with ruby red highlights, with a tan creamy head that reduces to a creamy collar, leaving a sexy lace in it's tracks.

147,92,zerk,4.7,"As I sit here pondering this work of art, the bottle calls out ""You are not worthy.""  Pours a chill hazed deep amber with a thin but persistent tan head. There is a little bit of lace left on the glass. Aroma is a blend of sweet caramel malt, spicy and floral hops. Flavor bursts in the mouth... coming in all directions... I can't even detect what comes first - it's an all out palate assault. Caramel, pine, citrus, pepper, bread dough, and a bitter spicy finish - incredible balance. Has a thick and full body, and a velvety mouthfeel. As I finished this beer, I wish there were more in the bottle... did I leave even a drop behind?  This is a truly outstanding brew... and I find that I'm one of the few... I am worthy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,paceyourself,4.31,"This is my second taste of a Stone brew and so much better than my first(Ruination IPA). The tan head disappeared slowly to show the clear copper-red color. The aroma was very odd, a soft chalky pine smell like no other i've had before. A sweet caramel taste sticked to the inside of my mouth and then the hoppy bitterness took over in a big way. Damn i love this brew! A very enjoyable almost oily bitter taste lingers for a long time. I do think i'm worthy of drinking Arrogant Bastard on a regular basis, so PLEASE Stone bring your brews to conn..

147,92,WanderingFool,4.28,"The bottle ain't kidding when it say's ""this is an aggressive beer."" Lots of flavor found in each sip. The beer pours a coppery color in the glass with a nice tan foam head that dissolves to a sheet of lace on the surface. A nice malty aroma with hints of caramel and orange peel hovers above the beer. Each chewy sip begins malty, then moves to caramel, pine, and what I would describe as orange peel, before finishing off with a bitter hoppy flavor. A sticky slighty bitter taste lingers after each sip.  This is a very good well balanced medium to full bodied beer. I find it to be very filling which leaves little room for another bottle. Definitly a beer not for beginners (i.e. macro beer drinkers!)",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Dmann,4.92,"Wow! After all of my friends hyping this beer up I took the plunge and and I ever glad I did! This has got to be the best smelling beer I have ever had. After I poured it, I let it sit for awhile and warm a bit and took in the aroma that had hints of pine and carmel. The beer bursted with flavor once it hit my mouth and just opened up, dominated by hops but I could taste the malt sneek in there before the great hoppy finnish. I'm glad this is a year 'round brew because it will be a regular in my fridge from now on.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

There are some beer-like smells too: caramel, copper pennies, bread etc. But the hops are so oily-strong that it veers into the household cleaner realm. Flavors are similar but with a rewarding finish of hot, buttery caramel. Not sweet. Bitter. Not subtle. An extreme style, I think, as opposed to poorly executed, which keeps it in the top quartile of beers. An impressive display.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Very fragrant hop aroma and plenty of other scents to keep the nose busy. Among them were toasted grains and fruit, mango I believe. The bitterness was huge at first, but after the first sip it seems appropriate due to the thick, dark malt flavor. The toastiness of the malt was certainly complimented by the lime-peel hop flavor. I noticed faint smoke somewhere in this complex brew. Somewhere towards the end of the extremely long finish, some retro-nasal coconut and diacetyl were noticed.  This was my first experience with the beer and the brewery. Im glad to say that it all lived up to the hype.

147,92,StevieW,4.73,"22 oz bomber bottle. Silkscreen demonic looking bastard on the front. He's been looking at me everytime I open my beer fridge since last May. I have been saving this bastard for a special occasion.  Dark copper to mahogany in color. Rich creamy tan head. Huge hop bubbles bust through. Initial smell was striking. Heavily hopped, but somewhat acidic and very harsh. My first instinct, was that the beer had gone bad. Not so. The smell eased off a bit, and made the beer more inviting.  Taste is a tongue grabbing experience like none other. Super, super, smooth malty goodness. Some toffee, carmel malt sweetness is present. Full rich malty presence, super smooth, and rich. Also some slighltly roasted fruit, plums, figs, earthyness. Reminiscent of a strong belgian ale, but slightly different more subtle flavors. Then the super charged hop kick strikes your taste buds, and doesn't ever let go. Bitterness lingers, and lingers, puckering your cheeks toward the end, but begging you for another drink. Perfectly carbonation, medium to full bodied. The flavors never waver one bit. Despite the strong flavors and mammoth hop burps, this beer had me unconsciously reaching for the glass again and again. It had my elbowing aching from tilting it, and sending rambling beermails to JohnnyP for unknown reasons. Well worth the wait, and worth seeking out again and again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,johnrobe,3.93,"Well I finally worked up the nerve to pop the cap off the Bastard. It pours a gorgeous deep mahogany in the glass with a massive, rocky, light tan head leaving a whole lotta lace. The aroma whacks you in the nose with brown sugary malt, fruity esters (some pineapple) and citrusy hops. In the taste, Malt and Hops are nicely balanced, though the ostentatious bitterness is a bit overwhelming at first. It's best to let this brew flex its muscles (i.e. breathe) for a few minutes. Huge caramel and fruit show up in the taste (like caramel coated apples) with plenty of citric hoppy bitterness to keep the brew from being cloyingly sweet. It loses points in drinkability just for being such a hugely rich and heavy brew. I'm full and content, no need for another.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,49degrees,4.5,"An exceptional dark amber ale fully of character and a striking amount of hops. ""This is an aggressive"" beer says the label, and I'll vouch that it doesn't lie. I had this beer on tap several weeks back and really enjoyed it but found that it was surprinsingly close to Mac & Jacks African Amber Ale. Being able to sit back and relax with a bottle in hand and the time and place to actually take some better notes to review it, I'm guessing my notes were wrong, or I was poured the wrong beer. (As such, I've resubmitted my review for this beer).  From the bottle, Arrogant Bastard doesn't look, smell or taste like Mac & Jacks, it's far superior. AB pours a deep reddish hue with a big white rocky head. Glass lacing is extensive.  Aroma wise, this one carries a very enjoyable hoppy kick, hints of fruit, and complex malts. It doesn't carry the pine hit that the Ruination IPA offers, which helps to make this a much more rounded ale which can be savored in more than one serving per sitting.  On the palette, the hops and malts are creatively balanced, providing hints of fruit, toasted malts and a slight peppery smokiness to it. Despite its edgy hoppiness, the malt factor kicks in to really make this an exceptionally well rounded ale that can be enjoyed again and again.  Great balance worth a closer look for those who have yet to venture into the grip of the Arrogant Bastard.  (ADDENDUM: 12/27/02 I had the opportunity to visit a place called Fogg & Suds on the outskirts of Vancouver, BC the other day, and to my astonishment this place is ""trying"" to fetch $30.00cdn for a bottle of this stuff. Buyer beware. Arrogant Bastard is great stuff, but it should be obtainable for less than 1/3 the price being asked for here.) &lt;sigh&gt;",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

The aftertaste lingers for quite awhile with a nice balance of carmel malts, floral hop bitterness and touches of alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is smooth and enjoyable. This is a great ale.

Still and all Arrogant Bastard induces just such ""irrational exuberance"". The hops would be over the top if it weren't for all the supporting complexity. This beer is a workout for the tongue because every taste bud gets to participate. There is a very faint malty sweetness in the background. And a bit of effervesence. Also some interesting herbal and vegetal notes. The alcohol is clearly distinguishable (though not distracting). And by the way, did I mention the hops.  I'm drinking this on draught and intend to find out if the bottled version passes muster.  It's even a pretty beer. Dark copper color. Moderate head and a nice cascading, layered lace as it goes down in the glass. And it does go down. Much too quickly. Almost perfect.

The promised ""arrogance"" is disguised a bit by a deceptively woodsy-sweet nose, and a luscious, creamy texture. The nose also suggests an aroma of apple. The flavor is assertive and hoppy, with a forceful, lingering bitterness in the finish. For the style, the hops could be toned down somewhat for my tastes.

147,92,aaronh,4.55,"I was comletely shocked by the amount of malt flavors this beer produced! This beautiful red-amber beer was served with a nice head that failed to ever fully subside. It left a nice lace on the glass as well. The aroma was very potent, with hops florals, citrus, and pine notes. The first taste startled me not because of the hops, but because of the excellent balance of maltiness and bitterness. Strong caramel notes were followed by an intense hop presence that left a lingering mitterness on the aftertaste. Every taste followed the same malt - citrus - bitterness trend, from beginning to end of the glass. The mouthfeel was very full, but yet somewhat refreshing with the heavy hop finish. The drinkability was good, as I did not realize the moderate ABV of this beer while drinking. This was a better beer than I had anticipated, and I plan to buy some arrogance again very soon.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,AtrumAnimus,2.8,This is definately a hop head beer. Very hoppy with a bitter finish. Rather ropugh on the pallate too. I love their logo though. Just not a very clean finish either. Drinkable but definately not on my list of favorites. The aroma is deceptive. Perhaps that is the real problem with this beer. You get the aroma of Hops and are probably expecting more than you get from the taste. Also tastes a lot like it was allowed enough fermentation time. PErhaps if they bottle fermented this beer it would smooth out and be excellent then.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

""And you are?"", I thought. It poured dark amber with a nice head. The first sip was exhillerating. I was not quite prepared for this. Mega hops and a BOLD taste. I thought, ""this will soon subside."" It didn't. The last drink tasted just like the first. I killed the bottle an about an hour and a half. A 22oz usually lasts me 30 minutes if it is my first. Not this time. I enjoyed and savored every gulp. When I finished, I could drink no more.

The smell was a definate precursor to the taste, this is hop heaven. The malt is a fairly passive backdrop, consisting of a mild caramel note. There is also a particular nuance of alcohol. Otherwise, this is hop-feast galore. This is not a meager ale. No compromises and no apologies. It is flavorful, bold, and well, arrogant.  Hop heads, embrace!

147,92,brewdlyhooked13,4.47,"The first time I had this beer, I was not ready for it. I was very new to beers outside of the mega scene, but willing to try. All I remember is bitter and unpleasant. Since then, I've done a lot of tasting and wanted to try this again. Good thing, too, as I realized why the first tasting wasn't so great.  To start out, ABA pours reddish brown, it looks like iced tea in the glass. A one to two finger head which really gives a strong citrus aroma on the nose like maybe orange peel. Don't be too easy on the pour, you want that head to be substantial. Stop halfway to see how the head is forming up and if you've been too gentle and need more foam, pour into the center of the glass instead of down the side.  Okay here's something to try: Once the glass is filled with a nice head hat, lick the foam so it just gets the tip area of the tongue. While some of the hop taste is there, you almost can get a straight fruit taste of what you are smelling. The taste is very citrusy and to me all orange.  The hops certainly prevail once you get past the head, but the citrus stays there also, right through to the aftertaste, which finishes warmly if you'll let this beer get above 55 degrees before you start, which leads me to the point I was alluding to at the top. I think the first time I had ABA it was too cold and the citrus was masked too much. Like night and day, much more enjoyable this time around.

Nose is malt, some what toasted, hop floral tones.The start is malt, the middle full, robust, the finish is devastatingly hopped, potently acidic, and the aftertaste malt dry.

The body was apple red colored and slightly cloudy and left drink marks down the side of the glass. Fruity aroma of grapefruit and pineapple lifesavers. The first few sips were like a multi layered flavor explosion. At first it seemed too sweet, too grapefruity, and too bitter, then after a few sips all these flavors seemed to join together as a cohesive unit that was in awesome balance. After about a half a pint I realized what all the hype was about since this was a very drinkable, full flavored beer. After a while I didn't even notice the bitterness of the hops.

147,92,hyuga,4.78,"I must say, this one starts to impress while it's still being poured! Burnt amber color topped by a huge sticky tan head that stays almost endlessly. Leaves tons of lace as the glass is emptied. Grand aroma of ultra-citrusy hops, as well as piney hop character. Just a little sweet malt backs it all up. The first taste is a war between malt and hops, both in full force. Rich and sweet maltiness comes on strong, along with sharp spears of citrus and rind-like hop bitterness. Hints of spicy alcohol. Grainy malt and bitter hop finish. It's usually hard to find that complexity in the finish of a beer. Tingly yet smooth mouthfeel. Not one part of the experience of this beer lacks flavor. Yes, that means a full body, this is one of the most full-bodied beers I've ever tasted. An aggressive beer that doesn't even think of holding back. Most are not worthy of this brew.

The brew smells very hoppy with a slight spice hint. The first sip leaves the mouth exploding in hop flavor. then suddenly the mouth is overwhelmed by a fruity grapefruit flavor mixed with clove.

Pours an deep, angry red that looks like the glow in their gargoyle's eye. Anf if the message on the bottle wasn't enough to warn the weak-kneed quaffers off, the aroma ought to be. Sure it's got a nice sweet malty undertone with a fruity boquet, but this beer doesn't keep its 7.2 ABV a secret.  Things don't get any gentler once this beer gets in you mouth. A medium body, which starts off with a mix of caramel malty sweetness and rind-like edginess, followed by the warming feel of alcohol and a big (what about this beer *isn't* big?) hop finish.  Another great beer from Stone. And you're surprised?",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,mophie,4.8,"Oh baby, this is a fantastic beer. Beautiful rich copper/brown with a frothy tan head; luscious. Exceptional fruity aromas, almost tropical, with some grapefuit balanced by some caramel sweetness. Taste is also fruity (guava?), grapefruity, slightly piney. Huge malt backbone in this beer gives it a sweetness that envelopes your tongue. But in the end hops rule, and the beer finishes with a bitter hop twang that makes you wonder whether you're worthy. I am, dammit.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,jreitman,4.5,The first thing I noticed was intense pineapple and grapefruit smells.

147,92,marc77,4.23,"Creamy, thick light tan sticky head tops a dark ruby hued brew w/ excellent clarity. Countable rings of bubbles interconnected by lace is left down the glass. Quite attractive. The aroma is a combination of a citrus hop nose and dark caramel malt, biscuit malt and a hint of diacetyl. Mild hints of roasted grain are present as well. Assertive hop bitterness hits the palate initially, but quickly gives way to a fairly rich malt profile comprised of deep caramel and toffee, buttery malt, and mellow dark fruity esters. The piney chinook hop flavor is not obtrusive, and melds well with the caramel malt and hints of darker roasted barley. Overall the flavor balance is skewed towards hop bitterness and flavor, but only slightly. Full in body, w/ well calculated smooth carbonation that helps accenuate the malt profile. Finishes w/ toasted malt quickly fading and clean hop bitteress lingering. Arrogant Bastard is an aggressively hopped brew with a rich malt foundation. It's not unlike Red Rocket ale, albeit with less roasted barley and a slightly higher hop bitterness. Very tasty.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

First off I like this style of Ale so I have tried a number of Strong ales. So I go to Mr G's in Plano and pull that 22 oz bad boy out of the cooler and read the lable and was cracked up!!. Said to myself this has to be good. Put it in refrigerator untill the next day. Friday I pour it into a pilsner glass and witness a beautiful glass of beer. The color was a nice copper, the head was thick and foamy with tight small bubbles and the stayed on and didn't dissipate at all. The taste was so smooth I couldn't believe I was drinking 7.2 % ale.

Tastes much different than I expected. Upon the look, it looks like it would be very heavy but it actually isn't. Don't get me wrong,this beer is strong and very bitter and hoppy. It is one of the most perfectly balanced beers I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. I much prefer it alone because food tends to alter the great taste. Brilliant! Perfect!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,NeroFiddled,4.5,"Easily one of the best beers I've ever had. A really unique beer utilizing a heavy charge of dark crystal malts and hop flavor. Highly hopped and luxuriously malty. The balance is clearly toward the bitter & hoppy side, but the malt balances perfectly! It's this razor sharp balance that allows the beer to finish clean and dry - not too flabby from alot of malt, and not too grating from back-of-the-mouth hop bitterness. Precision!  The body is a hazy orangish-copper with crimson highlights, and its full and foamy tan head holds quite well. It drops to a thin 1/4"" that remains throughout the first half of the glass, and it leaves dense, clinging rings of lace.The beautiful colr and head make up for any distraction that the haziness might cause the inexperienced taster. The bouquet wafts from the glass loaded with fresh hops (somewhat earthy and leafy, but also clearly citrusy... Goldings and Cascade?) over rich caramel malt. The firm body is accentuated by an exceptionally fine carbonation and it's smooth and creamy in the mouth. The flavor is rich and fairly complex with a sweet caramel and lightly fruity malt note up-front that combines with earthy and citrusy hop flavors as it crosses the palate. It finishes with a firm, drying bitterness and residual earthy and leafy hop flavors. If there's anything that hinders it's drinkability (apart from the fact that it's a full-charged malt & hop attack!) it's the 7.2% alcohol by volume. I may not be able to drink more than two, but I want to drink more than two! Well worth seeking out!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92

Came equipped with a big, frothy head (which shrank to a lasting, thin layer, but only after quite some time) and excellent lace. Nose was real strong on the hops, which I enjoyed mucho! But it wasn't all hops. Some malt and caramel notes were present as well. Pretty good body, and passes verry nicely over the tongue! Had a tasty, chewy maltiness to start, with some caramel there, but then you get blown away by the hops. It's a big, floral hoppiness, with a very long-lasting aftertaste. The finish is a tad dry, and the aftertaste sticks for a bit, with that caramel/hoppy combo.

Starts out with an assertive citrusy hop bitterness that's almost immediately joined by roasty toasty chewy malt - again, very complex. There are a lot of different flavors going on, all of them slapping your tastebuds around for kicks, and finding them all is a LOT of fun. The brew maintains its flavor balance throughout the sip, leaving the alcohol content well in the background. The roasty, bitter, and citrusy flavor contribute to a kind of ""rough"" mouthfeel that suits the beer well. It finishes as it started, with lingering roastiness, bitterness, hoppiness, and toasty maltiness and you heading back to the keg for another.

A unique aspect about the aroma is the scent of pineapple I pick up and it doesn't seem like the citrusy hoppy type of aroma. The first impression I get on tasting is alcohol. But not overbearingly. Then come the piney hop accents. Hops impart a nice bitterness. Pretty well balanced (but tipped in the favor of hops) and very tasty. Ranks right up there with some of my favorite ""Winter"" strong ales. There's a pretty complex fruitiness in this one. Great brew.  Stone is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries.

I detected a strong taste of grapefruit in this brew coming from the hops yet has a strong malty backbone to balance it out. Did I say ""balance"" in an AB review? . It has a very nice appearance of caramel color brew with a 3 finger head that shrunk down but lasted to the last drop [maybe I drank it too fast ;-) ]. I also liked the bottle for the size, the content and the label. Maybe they are using a little reverse psychology on some unsuspecting peeps. It was however, a fun experience.

Mellows a little as it warms, but maintains the oily raw hop intensity with only a hint of sweetish malt underneath.

Almost no carbonation. From the first sip the alcohol makes its presence known. Bitter throughout with a nutty-bitter slightly astringent aftertaste, which really lingers. A faint mustiness can be tasted, which seems odd and out of place. A real hoppy kick in the crotch.

My appreciation for the bitterness in beers is a recently aquired taste and still subject to occasional setbacks.  rerate 8-29-02: It's only been a few months since my original rating and already the ""overwhelming bitterness"" has changed to easily palateable bitterness. Nice creamy foam pitted head this time. Too dark to be called off-white. Body is reddish brown, nice but not exceptional. Aroma is some sweet malt and a slightly pine-liek hop bite.

147,92,Brent,3,"I guess I'm ""not worthy"" of this beer, as the bottle states. It had a lot going for it, a distinctive citrus note at the front and an assertive hops finish. For some reason, however, this beer did not win me over. Maybe I was just intimidated.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
147,92,Todd,4.7,"Presentation: 22 oz brown bomber with a silk screen painted label of the ""Stone Brewing Gargoyle"" which wards off impurities that would otherwise taint the sanctity of the brew. Though this gargoyle is a bit different ... he has an arrogant look to him, basically saying you are not worthy of this brew. The back of the label is freagin' halarious! More arrogance, teasing. No, double dog daring you to try the beer.  Appearance: Deep reddish brown in colour with an appealing off-white lace. Really frothy, sticky and retains remarkably well.  Smell: Coarse hop are all over the nose, as are toasted grains, fruity esters and alcohol. Very aromatic.  Taste: Medium bodied, yet rich, full and complex. Smooth, especially as it warms. Big malty sweetness with caramel, chocolate and toasted/roasted flavours. Alcohol prickliness teases the palate then the brew kicks its ass with an assertive hop profile. It's raw, coarse, a bit prickly itself, mildly rind-like. Helps to balance the huge malt flavours. Finishes with a lingering sweetness, caramel, roasted coffee. A bit grain/dry too.  Notes: Hugely complex. Its arrogance is indeed correct. As stated on the label, if you do not have the ""taste or sophistication to be able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth"" then you may not like it. Or rather, go drink your safe beer wimp. It's rather aggressive, but oh so damn good (in an evil, not worthy way). Just beware before you drink. This beer is not for the faint of heart.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,92
