345,1010,jdhops,3.79,"Canned 5/23/22. Best by 11/23/22.  L: Pours a clear gold with a medium fluffy white head that thins to a sticky film. Irregular and thin lacing.  S: Bready aroma, with a bit of lemon and just a touch of dank.  T: Bread up front, followed by some earthiness. Finishes nicely; dry and slightly bitter.  F: Medium mouthfeel and carbonation.  O: Well-made, if not exceptional. The earthy/musty/dank element seems a bit out of place, but not unpleasant.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Coronaeus,4.29,"Pours a bright golden hay with a moderate head that dissipates slowly. Lacing is on the lighter side.  Lots of grassy hop notes touch the nose. There is a herbal quality there too.  The sip keeps the grassy and herbal notes going. A light grainy character sits in behind. It’s all punctuated by a crisp almost spicy finish.  Light bodied, well carbonated and very enjoyable.  This is an excellent American Pilsner. Up there with my favourites from Suarez, Live Oak and Olde Mecklenberg.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,dano213,4,"12oz bottle received as a gift from a friend. This beer is often available in mix-a-six packs for $2/bottle. Says Best By 12 Apr 22; it's about 5 weeks past that date.  Look: Golden light straw color with a very small white head and lots of tiny bubbles rising up. Has the slightest chill haze.  Smell: Smells lemony, spicy, and earthy. There is a nice bready malt backbone with a good amount of sweetness too (think apple juice). I think there's a bit of skunkiness here too, and I'm okay with that. After swirling the glass, I get green bell pepper notes on the finish.  Taste: This is a very traditional German pilsner style. It's very light and slightly sweet on the palate up front, and the finish is crisp and bitter. This beer is very hoppy but it's not resiny at all; the hop character is slightly floral, but mostly citrusy and the finish is rindy / pithy without being juicy at all. A lot of spicy character also...lingering on my palate is an almost peppery, earthy flavor. There is a bit of skunkiness, but it's my own fault for not drinking and reviewing this sooner. That being said, I don't really mind it so it's all good.  Feel: Light to medium mouthfeel. Crisp and refreshing. Carbonation is appropriate. Very easy drinking.  Overall: This is renowned to be one of the better American-made Pilsners and I would say that it lives up to the hype. It's very easy to drink and fairly enjoyable without being boring. I just wish that it was easier to find this beer fresh; even though I live just outside of Philadelphia, it's not so easy to find and when you find it, it's often not so fresh. I think that's because so much of America is suffering from IPA-itis, a lot of beer stores are not having high turnover with beers like Victory Prima Pils so it tends to sit on the shelves for a while or a lot of stores have even stopped carrying it. I also with that Victory would brew their Home Grown Lager again, but that's a discussion topic for another time.  From the bottle: A crisp yet distinct Pilsner brewed with German hops that bring vivid notes of floral and spice with citrus and lemon. This is truly brilliant, bringing nuanced complexity together with smooth, easy drinking.

345,1010,jonphisher,4.53,"I have never reviewed what is probably my most drank beer of all time so here we go…  Pours beautifully light straw color, crystal crystal clear. Vigorous pour leaves a nice big fluffy white head with good retention and some nice lacing to.  Smell is so much grass, spicy and floral hops and a bright snappy maybe grainy malt aroma.  Taste leans into the hops as well, the floral hop bite show more in the taste than nose. Grassy and cracker like and spicy hop finish.  Super super clean and easy to drink, dry and nice bitter finish. Grassy like bitterness that lingers well after the sip is gone, the dry finish enhances this aspect in a very nice way.  If you haven’t drank this beer go try it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Singlefinpin,4.15,"Drinking this at one of my favorite tap rooms, Tapped Craft and Drafts in Greenville NC. Poured from a tap into a pint glass. Looks golden yellow with a nice white foamy head that dropped quickly to a thin cap. Smells lightly crackery, flora, grassl and sweet. Taste follows the nose nicely. Mouth feel is medium for the style. Overall a very nice example of a Pilsener that I would definitely order again.

345,1010,miwestcoaster,3.27,"Labeled German Style Pilsner. Look and feel is pilsner and acceptable within the style. But, all I taste from this beer is grassy hops. To call it a German pilsner, this falls short by Victory. They need to sample Warsteiner, Wernesgruner, Spatan, Bitburger, Paulaner, Kulmbacher, etc. Mexico made Bohemia Pilsner is a far better German pilsner than Victory Pils.

Sweet cracker malt, mowing sweet grass, and a whiff of sulphur.  The initial taste is corn and crackers. That sweet corn remains an undertone to very floral, sweet grassy hops that carry me through to a slightly herbal, crisp finish.  Rather a full body, but crisp with plenty of carbonation.  For some reason I had always thought this was a bohemian pilsner, probably because it’s hoppier than most German pils, which is also what makes it more to my liking.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,datstankadank,2.87,"Pours very golden, 4 finger head. Nose is overpowering European hops. Taste follows, a bit too much hoppyness to be considered balanced. Nonetheless, it is still a good beer.  Edit: Having had this side by side to other pilsners, this falls far short. Overly hopped, not nearly enough malt in the base to balance the absurd amount of hops. Simply too hop forward to quench the thirst or even simply enjoy. This drinks more like a pale ale or india pale lager. The high rating on this and other sites simply means the reviewers around here just like overly hopped liquids. This is not a good example of a pilsner, let alone a german pils.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Steve555,3.89,"Appearance, is yellow and fizzy with a large white head. Strong aroma of floral hops. Taste is unusual, fruity hops that are strong and insistent, like a hope taste in a pale ale rather than a pils, body is thick, mouthfeel is smooth and dry. For me this is too much like a lagery IPA for my liking, possibly more like an IPL but I wouldn't describe it as a proper pils. Whilst it's a nice enough drink the hop bitterness takes away from the refreshment aspect.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,PathofChaos,3.69,"Appearance: The head shows up big, foamy, and white as a Colgate smile. Below it is a column of translucent marigold. Retains and laces like a champ; that is to say, in an unbroken curtain that can stretch a boastful 3 inches down before fraying.  Bouquet: Herbal spiciness peppered over fresh white bread, chauffeured by a mild breeze of lemon grass.  Feel: A medium body that’s compellingly crisp. Each refreshing mouthful releases a confetti burst of tiny, edgeless bubbles. Wraps up with a dainty, citrus tang.  Taste: Bready malts, lemon rind, and tastefully attired herbal hops that reveal just enough floral spiciness to entice you into another sip.  Special Note: it's best cold and straight from bottle. Drinking it on tap or in a glass weakens the citrus and floral aspects by putting the malts too far forward.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,CDBeerDisappear,4.35,"Look: Clear golden yellow with plenty of foamy head. An abundance of fast rising bubbles. Good retention and some lacing. Smell: Smells like an early summer morning in Bavaria. There is herbal, floral and spice from the noble hops. Taste: Tastes and looks best when enjoyed from a pilsner glass. Taste is slightly malty with plenty of German bitterness from the noble hops, Tettnang, Saaz, Hallertauer, and Spalt. The taste of this beer makes the Lager-God smile! Feel: Medium mouthfeel with a crisp carbonation cleanup. Finishes clean but dry. Overall: I could drink this again and again. It’s everything good that I remember from beer in the 60’s and 70’s but it still stands up to the modern palate. I always have this in stock because it is THE standard for pilsner IMHO. This truly one of the best German style pilsners on the market.

Mouthfeel seems medium and a slight crispness. Completely dry with some heft to it. I've been meaning to have tried this for a long time but it seems to be languishing on shelves when I've come across it. Saw a fresh pack and picked it up. Solid pilsner brewed in the US of A.

No head to speak of, just a thin film leaving an even dotted coating on the ‘glass’ more so than a lacing. Nice sweet grassy nose with a touch of spice. Taste is dry, vegetal and grape-like with good bittering. Smooth, creamy, buttery mouthfeel. Lingering finish of dry malt, celery seed, and light floral hops. True to style, a fine American Pils.

345,1010,Squire,4.09,"Light clear gold color with world class white cap and lacing.  Aroma of rich malt and herbal, floral, spicy hops.  Taste is a bit hop forward with rich malt quickly following. The hops posses an herbal aspect that's a little more pronounced than I usually get with a Pils style which I suppose is an American brewing touch. Otherwise the hops are bright, spicy and have that firm hoppiness often found in European Pilsners. Malt remains like a percussion instrument providing a bass line while hops sing merrily along.  Medium texture with balancing carbonation.  I was looking forward to trying this one and was certainly not disappointed.

Is it a coincidence that I'm reviewing this now while the scene moves in favor of lighter, more flavorful lagers? Mayyyybe. It's just a solid, reliable, traditional Pilsner with a slight American twist with the addition of a tame but noticeably floral hop profile. Delicious!

345,1010,SHDoyle,3.54,"Description: Appearance is bright with a light, straw color and white head that quickly dissipates. Smell is malty and bready as might be expected but is also rather muted and unexciting. Up front, the taste is similar to the aroma in that there isn't much there, but it picks up a little on the back end and has a decent finish that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Unfortunately, it's not the ""good"" kind of bitterness you expect from hops. Instead, it's almost an acrid, burnt type of bitterness and it lingers. Feel is crisp with high carbonation and medium/light body.  Overall: 3.5 (This beer is average and I would not likely drink it again) Maybe this beer is standard for the style, but I've never been particularly fond of pilseners.

345,1010,Alieniloquium,4.22,On tap at Das Biergarten. Clear golden yellow. Smells of spicy and grassy hops. A hint of bright tropical fruit hops. Tastes of grassy and spicy hops throughout. Aggressively hopped and immediately bitter. Malt flavor is slick and full without being sweet or bready. Medium light. Absolutely delicious.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Spike,3.97,"355ml bottle. L: Hazy, pale gold colour with a thick, white head that lasts and leaves many rings of lacing. S: Some dry lemon. T: Follows the nose plus lots of hoppy bitterness. Not crisp, almost wheat-like. F: Smooth, dry, tongue-coating. O: Drunk 3 weeks before BBD. Has a dusty quality that I wouldn’t typically associate with a pilsner. However, it results in a smooth, extra dry brew. Very good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,RaulMondesi,4,"Well, my peeps, I think it’s safe to say that I have finally found my Pilsner! Prima is glorious and delicate like Audrey Hepburn shopping for a new clutch.

Just goodness here, my peeps.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,moodenba,4.11,"Victory Prima Pils single bottle purchased in Feb. 2018. The beer was chilled to about 45 F and poured into an undistinguished glass. There is a thin white head and pale, slightly cloudy body. Possibly a little over the hill? The flavor is quite nice, with a traditional hop flavor leaving a nice aftertaste. I'd prefer a little more malt body. i tried this beer a few years ago and I was somewhat dissatisfied. After trying many northern European style beers, I've decided that this is about the best one available (in early 2018; see below). I think some of the Great Lakes lagers are excellent, but no longer available to me. Also, some of the recent local Blue Point (AB Inbev) draft-only German style beers were good, but likely only one-offs. Update 2019: I've discovered Brooklyn Pilsner, and it is by far my favorite pilsner; I prefer it to other domestic and imported pilsner brews available on Long Island, NY.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,deleted_user_995920,4.52,"Looks about a 3 on the SRM beer color index. Smells like wet crackers, hops, mild ethanol. Tastes is full bodied, nice hop bite and the delicious malts. Feels almost dry, but it has a final hop burst. Very delicious. Overall one of the best,if not the best American German style Pils I have had. I would not dismiss Brooklyn Pilsner as one of the best also.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,kevanb,4,"12oz bottle, enjoy by date was smudged but known to be fresh, poured into a Victory snifter glass. Enjoyed on 8.2.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a bright golden color, nice clarity with just a hint of chill haze and a tall white head with good retention and soapy lace. The aroma is great, bright noble hops with a nice crisp earthiness, mineral water, pale grain, lightly floral with a bit of citrus. The flavors are nice, crisp hops, cirtrusy with a nice grassiness that offers light bitterness with plenty of grain and mineral water and a touch of grapefruit peel at the finish. The mouthfeel is good, crisp, light, delicate with nice a dry finish.  Verdict: A very good pilsener from Victory. Perhaps the quintessential example of the style brewed in America, nice balance, so refreshing and easy to drink.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Stout_Hunter,5,"The only beer I will ever give a 5. It is truly the perfect beer when fresh and slow poured. 6 pack cans Best Buy date of 05/01/2018. L: Slow poured into a Pilsner glass. Looks amazing perfect rocky white head and crystal clear light gold color. S: Smells so lively of earthy hops and some subtle pils malt sweetness at the end. T: The sips are consistent in flavor. Perfectly simple and complex at the same time. The bittneress is absolutely perfect and although this pils packs hops,44IBU, it still tastes well balanced. Each gulp is delicious and my taste buds want more and more. Easily crushable. F: This pils is perfectly crisp and has a light body but not super light, wouldn’t call it medium either though. O: I am not a hop head by any means but this beer is perfect. Hop forward; yes but still balanced well. Some heavy hopped pils just taste like an ipa mixed with a miller lite but not this one. I have been on a huge Pilsner kick and I can’t really say I have found a better crafted Pils out there accessible to me. IMO you can’t beat a fresh can of slow poured Prima. I would really love to find this on tap somewhere in the summer. If you haven’t tried it definitely DO! And if you aren’t slow pouring your Prima DO any slow poured Pils is amazing. YouTube it if your unfamiliar it will give your pils a whole new taste!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ExtraStout,3.9,"This is one of the better Pilseners I have tried (along with Schell), and leads me to wonder why so many other ones are so bland and tiresome. The beer is a lightly cloudy pale gold color with medium white head that lingered quite awhile. Lots of small bubbles and thin lacing. The aroma is zesty hops. Light-bodied and crisp with a peppery hops flavor throughout. Some malt is evident as well. The finish is dry and hoppy. The Pils style is nowhere near my favorite but I can see this beer being the standard by which to measure others.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,drexeldan,4.28,"There are certain types of brews that Victory does very well. These are almost invariably British or German-styles (don't bother to order a Victory Belgian-style offering.) The main reason for this is that Victory is a hop=forward brewery. Their brews are almost always heavier on hops than most other craft breweries. Pilsner is a style that is right up their alley, given the requirement for a sharp finish.. Prima is one of the best brews they produce. The abv (5.3) is higher than most pilsners - a direct result of their fascination with hops. Of their flagship group. Prima Pils and Hopdevil IPA are the two that stand out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,SmashPants,3.16,"Format: a standard 330mL bottle with - for a boutique, expensive beer - one of the worst labels I have seen in a while. Hopefully the beer delivers more than the package.  Appearance: poured into a pilsner glass - a fairly clear, light colour with plenty of bubbles across the profile. A thin head on top that fritters away. Not brilliant-looking.  Aroma: a decent mix of grassy hops and light malts. Nothing special, but a good, solid nose.  Taste: the flavour follows the nose - grass hops and malts. Okay.  Aftertaste: more of the malts than the hops, with some astringency.  Mouth feel: a light body with a fair old amount of carbonation. Pretty standard for a pilsner.  Overall: a standard pilsner, nothing particularly special. Add a price of AU$85 a case of 24 x 330mL and you cn definitely find better for near half the price.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Though not my preferred beer style, Pilseners are one of those styles that in my mind I should like more, but I don't, and I'm not entirely sure why. But this pils, holy crap, this is a pils I can get into. Though not much to look at out of the can - much of an also ran yellow-ish beer color, it does have a nice frothy head and a tiny bit of lacing. The smell has a malty character with orange undertones, which contrasts the crisp (is that lemongrass I taste) lemony flavor sloshing around in my mouth. Mouthfeel is very light and has a dry finish as advertised. Again, quite possibly the best pils I've had, and I'm glad I have a few more on hand to partake.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

S: Sweet, sulfuric, and crisp. A metallic tang amongst the fruity-malty grain. T: Clean and lightly sweet. This is an excellent pilsner. But there's not a lot going on. The grain isn't sulfuric in the taste, unless that's the lightly bitter bite on the endtaste, but I think not. The mouthfeel is moderate, with some fizz and some heavier sugars. O: Lightly sweet, balanced, clean. But aside from a mild floralness, a perfectly balanced bitterness, and an interesting whiff of fruit, I might as well be drinking fizzy wheat tea. Very mild. But sometimes that's what you want.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BeerBobber,4.11,"Not quite so clear of a golden color topped by a finger and a half of a thick white head. Color actally leans more towards a hazy lemonade.  Smell is very floral and grassy.  Taste is very pilsner in quality, floral grassy and a bit hoppy on the end. Even picking up a bit of a salty bready note on the flavor.  Mouth is light yet a bit wet on the back end. Not quite getting a crisp finish on this pilsner.  Overall this pilsner is very nice on the taste. Seems to have that traditional grassy, herbal, floral flavor that rolls into a bit of skunk if you let it warm. Yes even from a can I can pick up some odd skunk notes. Seems indicative of the style. Overall a damn good beer for food pairing. Would love to slam some tall frosty glassses of this at our local pub while me and the wife enjoy a happy hour pizza with lots of spicy toppings.

However! That is behind me now - I just put down a sixer over the course of the week. I'll be short and sweet with my review since there are so many on here that go to impressive levels of depth: clean, crisp, perfectly carbonated, refreshing, golden body, floral, spicy hops, mild bitterness, crackery malt.

There is also a touch of hop spiciness and the finish is bone dry.  Feel is light and crisp with moderate carbonation. Very easy drinking.  Overall a very good pilsner.

The beer is entirely translucent.  S: Biscuity, bready, and earthy: everything that I look for in a good pilsner. It is clear why this is a staple within the style.  T: An unexpectedly nice hoppy flavor on first sip followed by some of the more traditional pilsner flavors. Sweet, doughy finish, albeit a little light.  F: Good body for it being such a light beer. It finishes a little bit on the light side, but it is nice otherwise. As mentioned earlier, good carbonation all throughout and no alcohol burn whatsoever.

345,1010,cjgiant,4.19,"Bottled BB end of March, 2017 Pours with a little more chill haze than it ends up with when it is a straw yellow/white. The body is mostly clear and you can easily see laconic bubbles rising to the surface.. The head doesn't grow too large, even with a fairly vigorous pour. The head has a foamy soapy look and provides nice lines of lacing.  The nose has a grassy/crackery note to it. The pilsner malt comes out nicely, and the bittering hops are not rushing at my olfactory sense. There's perhaps just a little citrus - a sweet-tart little spritz in the mix as well.  A medium bodied beer, the up front notes come mainly from the malt, a thick cracker-like taste. A grassy background grabs my palate's attention as it focuses on it. As the hops come forward, there's a brief note of cardboard. Fleeting, the grassy hops some forth to shake my tongue. There is a decent little effervescence here that is mildly distracting to me but might be considered refreshing to others. The lingering notes sometimes seem to have a little unripe grapefruit pith to it.  A classic beer that was one of the first beers that turned the tide for me on desiring a hoppy, more bitter beer.

Pungent grassy/grainy hops, sunflower seeds, black pepper, and when I get my nose into it, some lemongrass, and a nice biscuit malt. With the flavor, black pepper, grassy, slight citrus, nice bready/cracker malt, and a subtle but present, building bitterness. Very very dry, a little too dry, for me.

Crisp malts and honey on the nose, light oat.  Very tasty, very clean. Lots of grain flavors to start, with a pleasant fruity banana aftertaste. This is not devoid of hops however - as lots of czech influence comes out to play with sharp biting hops thoughout. Bready finish.  Feel is crisp, smooth, clean. Exactly as a pils should be.

345,1010,thebeers,3.9,"Slightly hazy yellow gold with two fingers of dense, bright white head that leave rings of lacing. Bready aroma with typically-floral pilsner hops and a hint of tropical sweetness. Medium bodied with strong carbonation that adds or accentuates a little spiciness in the taste. There's an herbal flavor and just a touch of malt sweetness for the style mid-palate, while remaining relatively dry and bitter in the aftertaste. Revisiting this after a long hiatus, I can see why people love this beer, but I still prefer a more traditional German pilsner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,CO-Bloom,4.11,"I have been exploring pilsners more and more and this is one of my favorites.  L - Crystal clear, light straw yellow. With a big white head with billows of rocky foam. S- grassy, herbal and spicy hops hit the nose (not as big on the nose as some NW hop varieties) . Faint cracker malt profile. T- I am first hit by the grassy, herbal hops which are actually surprisingly bitter. This is one of the more bitter pilsners I have had (which isn't saying it is all that bitter compared to other styles.) I can't tell if it brings the beer down a little because it might distract from the subtle cracker, breadiness of the pilsner malt that I look for - I think gets a little overpowered. But I love hops so I still very much enjoy it. F- A little fuller feel than some other in the same style, but between the overall lightness and bite of hops this is very crisp and refreshing with some slight dry bitterness on the back end. O- Great american take on the style, I have really enjoyed what I have sampled from Victory. Prost!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

The nose is pungent with Noble hops; very herbal and spicy, green pepper, leaning towards black pepper, fresh cut grass, khale and spinach, earth, flowers, then biscuit and lightly toasted graininess.  Upfront, you gets tons of herbs. Chives, khale, spinach, green onion. In the middle you get biscuit and toasted graininess. There's a touch of orange peel. Then there's a lingering hoppy finish, earthy at first, then peppery, then with an herbal arugula/khale/spinach bitterness.  The mouthfeel is a little fuller than most pilsners I've had recently; I'd say medium-bodied, smooth, well-carbonated but not overly so, crisp and clean, but with quite the strong bitter aftertaste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,FBarber,3.54,"Revisited blind 5/22/2022:  Pours a crystal clear golden color. Two to three finger white sudsy head forms on the beer, lingers then completely dissipates. No residual head and little lacing. Aroma has notes of crackery malts, light grains, a touch of sweetness, with a very light hoppiness on the back end.  Taste follows the nose with notes of crackery malts, some light grain, strong hoppy notes bringing with it some dried grass, a bit of musty hay, and spicy, peppery notes. Feel is light, crisp, easy drinking. Semi-dry on the finish.  Overall this seems to be an American pilsner - it has got the crackery malt backbone with a really strong hop presence, although the hops do not appear to be American. Its a solid beer, but not my favorite profile for a pilsner.  _______________________________  Pours a clear crisp golden color with a thick frothy white head that quickly dissipates. No lacing or residual head to speak of.  Smell is of wheat, fresh grain, and malt. Undertones of a slight honey scent and some subdued floral hops.  Taste was of a slightly sweetened bready malt initially. Very subdued floral and grassy hop flavor on the back end with some ever so slight bitterness. I wasn't quite sure how old this bottle was and given the subdued and grassy hop flavor, Im guessing pretty old.  Feel was very nice, crisp and refreshing. Perfect for a pils. Medium carbonation.  Overall this was probably the best American interpretation of a pils I've come across. I tend to really not like Victory, but they hit a home run with this one. Even with an older bottle it was wonderful. In cans, this will be a mainstay in my fridge.

345,1010,josiahschlender,4.14,"Heard about this brew a long time ago, and finally noticed a six pack of it out here in the west. Too bad it's not easier to find in Oregon.  Prima Pils pours a rich golden yellow with a brilliantly white foamy head that fades too fine ring around my glass.  A nice hoppy aroma that reminds me of a hayfield and something mildly herbal and mixes with an unsweetened malt aroma like crackers. It's past the freshness date, so I might be missing on some smells that dissipate with time.  Flavor is distinctly light lager but are more intense and complex than any light lager/pils I've drank before. It has a surprisingly long finish that ends nicely bitter without punishing. Feel is perfectly clean and crisp with substantial body to match its full flavor.  Overall, a beer very high on the drinkability scale for me while being a versatile pair with food.

345,1010,Beginner2,3.87,"OK, a very popular beer here. Let's see why. Maybe because American innovation/palate brings in more hops than the German version. At 44 IBU, it is more; but still balanced. I note that I enjoyed in more as it warmed and as I ate appetizers and cheeses.  MJ's 1999 edition gave Prima Pils 3 of 4 stars and praised Victory beers as ""well-balanced and very expressive in their hop and malt character"" and note Prima as ""notably Saaz-accented"".

Freshly crushed black pepper on the nose, spot-on, plus pungent wafts of that classic pilsner smell. Seriously, was black pepper a part of this recipe? The flavor steps back from the spiciness and instead focuses on herbal hops and bitterness with that robust pilsner malt laying a foundation, with nuances of lemon spritz and tartness, slight melted butter. Dry. Mouthfeel is light with plenty of fine carbonation. One of the sexiest looking beers I've ever seen. But watch out, just like hot blondes, this beer is also high on the crazy scale. The black pepper on the nose was so realistic and upfront I had to double check to see if there were little black specks floating around. I half loved it, but ultimately wasn't appetized by it. Gladly, that note's strength didn't carry onto the palate, which was evenly distributed between hops and malt with other fun side attractions. It would have been outstanding if not for a nagging buttery note. Feel was great, perfectly bitter and dry and quenching and light. Thanks for an actually memorable pilsner experience, Victory.

345,1010,Kuaff,4.41,"Cellar temperature in my tulip.  Pours like crystal-clear liquid gold, with two centimeters of white, fleeting fizz.  Quite a bit of lemon in the scent, along with some pretzel-like yeast. There's an earthy herbal component as well.  Refreshing, zesty, juicy lemon strikes my palate first. Then it beautifully dries into a crisp, clean bready finish. Moderate noble hop, herbal bitterness lingers a bit. Not a lot else to mention, but a truly great balance of features.  The feel is fittingly light, with an ideal level of carbonation that makes it spritzy and sprightly without going overboard.  Fantastic, balanced intensity of citrus and bread and of fruitiness and bitterness. This is honestly one of the most refreshing beers I've ever had. It would be KILLER as a post-excersize refreshment.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Skywave,4.55,"Pours to a creamy white head and ample lacing. Bright gold color. Aroma is biscuity malt and clean grass, spicy, floral hops. Flavor is well balanced with all the flavors in the aroma with a soft, pleasing alpha acid bitterness. Mf is to style. Worthy of its accolades.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

There are some light hops that give off citrus and a bit of pine. The malt smells a touch sweet and earthy.  T: 4 Like the nose, the taste pretty mild, but well-executed. A bit sweet up front , moving on to very clean flavors, and hops adding the similar elements from the nose. The finish is like a classic pilsner with the addition of some bitterness (a bit too much for the style).  M: 4.5 Crisp, clean feel with good carbonation. The finish is a bit dry making this beer very refreshing.  O: 4.25 Excellent pilsner with great flavors and aromas, if a little mild. It would be nice to get a super fresh bottle as I imagine it would be spectacular.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,JPowell712,4.02,A true classic Pilsner. It was clean and refreshing and still had a nice hoppy bite to it and a slightly dry finish. Definitely a drinkable beer for the warmer days. Once opened it poured a nice golden straw color with a white head. The hops and malts were definitely captured in the aroma. You still get a full flavor of hops and malts and it goes down smooth. Very good beer!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Cure_Tap,3.75,"An all around solid brew. This beer strike a good balance between floral hops and a mild, grainy malt. Finish is dry and you are left with a mildly bitter aftertaste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,SSS,4.04,"A-Very light yellow, with a nice thick super white head S-For me this is a 'yellow beer' smell, like cardboard...maybe other can pick up nuances like biscuit or something, I can't M-Light, very light and crisp, not overly dry. Carbonation is light and smooth as well T-This beer is relatively light and soothing, not harsh at all, very drinkable. O-I was expecting a little more from this beer, but was still grounded by its simplicity and I accepted that it was a classic pilsner, it does that well.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,craftbeersweden,3.73,"Victory Prima Pils As a part of Variety of Victory I got this Pilsner from Victory Brewing.  It's a clear, yellow, beer with a one finger high, white head.  Nose: Floral, grass, spice, biscuit and yeast. Taste: Biscuit, caramel malt, white bread, hops and hay. Body: Medium, creamy body. Medium, soft carbonation. Dry finish and a great bitterness. Smooth taste!  Really good, balanced pilsner!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Buck89,4.21,Beautiful clear golden color with a two-finger white head that dissipated quickly. The nose was a nice subtle floral spiciness followed by biscuity notes. The taste was wonderful - spicy herbal hops with sweet maltiness and a lingering slightly hoppy finish. Nice light feel. A great German Pilsener.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,TH28,3.81,"12oz bottle. 6/15/15 code date. Appearance: Light golden and probably the clearest beer I’ve ever seen. Nice thick white frothy head that lingers. Aroma: Floral, grassy hop notes on a light crackery malt base. Taste: Light crackery malt sweetness, with a subtle but strong hop bitterness to balance. Slight spiciness to the hops. Mouthfeel: Light bodied with a moderate, crisp carbonation. Finish: Spicy and herbal hop bitterness lingers. Overall: Beautiful looking pilsner with nice floral and spicy hop characteristics. Maybe slightly subdued bitterness for a German Pils",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,maedhros09,4.35,"Look: Light gold with pretty average white head, little retention/lacing Smell: Classic pilsner aromas of cereal and grassy hops Taste: Smooth lightly sweet maltiness with the herbal hops lingering behind until the maltiness fades and then a long bitter finish. some fruitiness is present as well. light to medium body, pretty typical pilsner carbonation, perhaps slightly less active.  Overall: Prima Pils lives up to the hype - it is a very full flavored bohemian inspired pilsner. Nicely balanced, it is lightly sweet with a pretty good hop kick to back it up. There are times when I want a milder pilsner in which this won't be my first choice but for a full flavor kick it's a great option. The palate has some complexity as well, which can't often be said of pilsners. Great stuff!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,tillmac62,4.38,"EBD 9/16/15. Pours a clear golden. Normal head volume and retention, outstanding lacing.  Nice, but light, nose of herbal and spicy hops over a mild biscuit with lager yeast.  Heavy light body with a smooth texture that has a subtle creamy aspect at times. Perfect carbonation with a nice effervescent burst in the middle and a rollicking prickly finish.  The flavor profile is world class. It is intense (hop flavor), somewhat complex and well balanced. It begins with Saaz hop flavor (not as pronounced as Urquel, unfortunately) that flows into a mild bitterness in the middle. As the bitterness asserts itself, a biscuit sweetness arrives to provide a tasty balance. The finish is a bit dry, not quite clean and a nice Saaz hop flavor lingers over a subtle sweetness coupled with a mild bitterness. THIS is what a German pilsner should taste like.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,OldManMetal,3.27,"This is a crystal-clear, slightly sparkling straw-colored lager that could be a real eye-catcher if given a nice thick creamy white head rather than a brief rocky scree. The nose is pleasantly malty with alcohol undertones and hints of spicy hops. On the palate it is hop-forward, with a significant bittering hops presence that dominates the pilsener hops flavor and lagery grain notes; the finish is the same, with the bitterness lingering long enough to overstay its welcome. The texture is a bit thicker than the light body would lead you to expect, and the carbonation is nice and prickly.

345,1010,fscottkey,3.26,"A: [4.75] Forms a full 3 fingers of head. The head is bright white and made of small to medium bubbles. The head has some staying power. The beer itself is a transparent light straw color. The bottle lists the ABV (5.3%) and there is a best by date (06/09/15).  S: [3.00] Yeast. Mild apple scent.  T: [3.25] Sweet fruits on the front. Very sweet with a hint of yeasty breadiness. The sweetness has a bit of a caramel flavor to it. The finish has a tart apple hint to it,  M: [3.00] The finish is dry. The carbonation is low to medium.  O: [3.25] The sweetness and the fruitiness surprised me on this one. It is a decent beer but I think it could get cloyingly sweet after more than one. The nose was really weak which made the flavors on the tongue a bit of a surprise. Visually this beer shines! The taste is decent. I would choose a lot of beers before this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,DaverCS,3.79,"Poured into my generic pilsner glass, the beer poured 1 finger of quickly dissipating head. The beer is extremely clear with a pale yellow color.  Aroma is slightly skunky. I get a mild hay or grain characteristic. Very little to no hop characteristic on the nose.  Taste is primarily the hay, followed by a slight smokiness. It's almost a stale taste, even though the beer is rather fresh-- perhaps it is slightly irony. The beer is nicely crisp but rather non-descript in terms of any flavor besides the hay. It reminds me a lot of Stella Artois. The beer is nicely dry as is expected with the style.  Overall, this is a good, basic summer beer. Nothing spectacular in my opinion, but I also do not drink pilsners all that much. It beats any BMC beers for sure, but it still doesn’t provide any differentiating qualities/characteristics that truly make it fantastic or unique. This beer would pair well with just about anything, I could definitely see sitting down to a fried chicken dinner with this beer. It gets a 76/100.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

The layers of hops were interesting.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,GrahamDN,4.47,"Beautiful gold color topped with a fluffy white foam. Sweetly doughy and floral, the nose is a great tribute to a classic German pils, and even more inviting than many good German examples. Prima is hop-forward on the palate, showing grass and flowers against a doughy-biscuity malt backdrop. The carbonation and bitterness keep it lively on the tongue and lead into a dry finish that begs to be refreshed with another sip. Top notch.  Absolutely will buy again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Poured into a pilsner glass - decent white head, nothing to write home about  S - initial smell is somewhat fruity, with that raw malty finish you'd expect from a Pilsner  T - fairly similar to the smell but the hops are much more prominent, moreso than the average Pilsner. Definitely some fruity undertones, grapefruity  F - light and crisp, refreshing  O - a nice hoppy Pilsner, which is not surprising when it comes to Victory. As a guy who usually swings towards IPA, this is definitely a solid beer in my book. I love the hops, but always enjoy a lighter beer like this, especially when it's on the hoppier side.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,Redneckwine,4.06,"12oz bottle into tulip  Appearance - Pale, golden, and crystal clear. 1 finger head dissipates quickly to a wispy cap, some spotty lacing.  Smell - Nice snappy Pils malt: raw, grainy, biscuity and fresh. Kick of sweet/sour green apple skin. Hops have a nice combo aroma of grassy/spicy/herbal.  Taste - Much like nose, but hops are kicking much harder than you'd sense from the nose - grassy and herbal with a lemony citrus snap. Malt is raw and grainy with a touch of much needed honey sweetness. A bit of that apple/grapeskin peaks in, then this brew dries out real fast and a moderate grassy/herbal bitterness lingers.  Feel - Light/medium body with a nice and light feel, carb is active but not overly so. Smooth yet crisp.  Overall - Pretty much hits the nail on the head for the ""hoppy pilsner"" style: crisp, hoppy, and very drinkable. It might go juuust slightly overboard on the hops for my taste, but I could see myself knocking back a few of these any old time.

Mouthfeel: Mid-to-lightweight body; a touch less carbonation than I typically associate with the style.  Overall: This is lightyears better than the last bottle of this I had. That one was clearly off (always check bottle dates, and thank you Victory for having them). Still, if the goal is a clear, crisp, easy-drinker, this is off the mark.

345,1010,ThePaintedGrey,3.85,"12oz. bottle poured into pint glass.  A: Nearly transparent pale yellow hue with a bubbly bleach white head that quickly fizzles down to a small cap, but leaves some lacing in its wake. Good for the style, I would say.  S: More hop-heavy than I was expecting. A nice floral aroma atop a platform of pilsner malt. Not much according to my nose. Short, sweet, and to the point!  T: Oooh, this is nice and hoppy, by pilsner standards. A lovely floral profile meddled together with some bready sweetness from the malt. Perfectly balanced from the start and through the middle, but the finish fades out with a hint of bitterness that's just really hitting the spot for me.  M: Pilsners aren't known for their ostentatious mouth presence, but Prima Pils clocks in towards the upper-end of the spectrum for the style. Solid medium body with the perfectly level of carbonation. Crisp, smooth, and refreshing. Drinks like a goddamn champ.  O: I'll admit that I'm a few steps away from a pilsner hater. They're just not my thing and I've accepted that I'm not going to like every beer style. I picked up Prima Pils for two reasons, honestly. First off, my pop is a huge fan of pilsners and lagers and this is one of the most praised (American) German pils around. And secondly, Victory is a local brewery that offers several beers that I adore, so I felt obligated to at least entertain their pilsner offering. I'm almost reluctant to admit that I love this beer. It's not one of my dearly beloved IPAs or stouts, but this beer, quite frankly, is effin' delicious. It's light, yet flavorful. It's top-tier, yet available. And given that summer is only midway through, you can bet this will be the beer of choice in my family BBQ coolers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Fellysmarts,4,"This is my first review. A - I poured this bottle into a Pilsner glass. Slight head, had a decent carbonation and a wonderful clear golden liquid. Head was thin but remained there for awhile. S - The aroma was that of what you would look for in a good pilsner. Citrus, biscuit and a nice slight hop aroma. T - The taste was balanced. Citrus, malt, biscuit and a piney hop taste right at the end. M - Carbonation was right on point. Well balanced. The balance of malt and hops was really good. O - Overall, I am very pleased with this beer. I don't tend to like pilsner as much as other styles but this one got my attention. I wouldn't turn one down. Thankfully they are offered year round and Victory is located in the state I live in.

345,1010,malvrich,3.47,"brown bottle poured into a pilsner glass a: Clear golden yellow with fine light to average carbonation. A gentle pour yields a finger of white head that dissipates after about 5 minutes leaving a decent amount of lacing which holds nicely to the glass. Pools of foam also tend to remain on the surface of the beer.  s: Nothing sticks out. A little biscuit balanced by a very subtle floral hop aroma.  t: Again, well balanced with a slight but noticeable hop bite. Smooth maltiness provides a hint of chewiness to the beer. Hops on the finish which is appealing as it lingers however I'm not getting floral as in the nose. Not nearly as hoppy as some have opined and definitely not citrusy. Maybe slightly more piny or herbal.  m: Very light body with the bubbles providing a slight tingle. Again I notice a ""fine"" quality to the bubbles. Doesn't look like much but I kind of like it. I think this works nicely against the malt too, tying the flavor profile together. I would like a bit more more carbonation in this beer.  o: Have to say I'm a bit disappointed with Prima especially after reading that it is among the absolute best in the style. Same as with Sierra Nevada Summerfest which is nice of course but also fails to impress me in any way. Certainly nothing bad to report but while interesting, also a little underwhelming at its price.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,kflorence,4.29,"A: Pours a crystal clear, golden yellow in color with a half inch of thick, creamy head atop. Carbonation levels look average. Head retention is excellent and there is noticeable lacing on the glass edges as you drink. A beautiful, classic pilsner appearance leads me to believe this one will be smooth and refreshing.  S: Sweet grains and grass dominate the aroma with notes of floral hops, light fruits and a tiny bit of cream corn. I suppose you could say a bit soapy. A truly classic pilsner aroma, I could use a little less grass/astringency on the nose, but spot on otherwise.  T: Spicy, floral hops up front with some grass. Sweet, pale malts and cream corn dominate the middle. The two eventually marry in the finish which is crisp with bitter grass and sweet grains. The bitterness remains on the tongue for some time, but is pretty tame.  M: Light bodied with prickly carbonation, this one goes down smooth and easy with a slight amount of cream and chewiness. Crisp, dry and sessionable.  O: Picked this up on a whim and was not disappointed. What I found here was a classic European pilsner done American style with a slightly amplified hop profile, though if I were to complain I'd say the malt profile was a bit lackluster. Still, you could do far worse if you're looking for a good American pilsner. This is the first brew I've reviewed from this brewery and I'm pretty impressed thus far.

345,1010,boddhitree,4.01,"Appearance: Again, looks like a regular Pils, deep golden straw under a snow white head.  Aroma: Smells Pilsy, lots of sweet Pils malts, quite nice, just like a German Pils, with Noble hops lingering in the background.  Flavor: Up front: Nice bitterness, quite hefty but not overpowering. I get a good deal of tartness/astringency here, too, with a typical German bittersweetness.  Mid: Again, same as up front, but even stronger. Not much Pils malt sweetness on the sides, as I'd expect in a German Pils; rather, it's really tart to bitter here, going into citrusy.  Back: Here's more bitterness and tartness, but still not much Pils malt sweetness. mmm... this is more a typical Märican Pils if I don't get any Pils malt sweetness soon. Still, it's laden bitterness, which I like, but it's really just a one-note wonder.  Aftertaste: Bitter bitter bitter, bitingly so.  Mouthfeel: Perfect like a real Pils, nice and thick, but still crisp and biting.  Overall: This beer really isn't much better than any of the others I've had. It's got lots of bitterness, astringency and a tad of citrus, but not much else. It's powerfully bitter, which I like, but I keep waiting for a sweet PILS malt to show up and tell me it's something more than a hop-sicle, that it's a PILS with a enough Pils malt to be a balanced beer. Hate to say it, but I'm not terribly impressed, except with the amount of Noble hop bitterness they packed in without making me feel totally overpowered, though it's nearing that limit the more I drink it. But wait, I'm getting now some pils malt sweetness somewhere, but it's in and out and not a major component of this beer.  Again, it's kinda like playing tennis, having a killer forehand,... and not having a back-hand. It ain't gonna get you far as a tennis player without being balanced. I'm sorry, Jack, I really wanted to wow this beer, but it's not nearly as good as the best from Kneitiner, Faust, or Mahrs, or whichever I said I loved. It reminds me a lot of the beers I reviewed from Franken and said were hop-forward, but even they had Pils malt lurking all over the place to keep my interest. This bitterness of the VictoryPrima Pils is hard to take after I get to the end of the glass and I keep waiting for the sweet in the bittersweetness that is wonderful Pils to rescue me. Sorry, a 4 of 5, though maybe the best I've had here this go-round.  Maybe the solution is to make a new beer style, the Märican Pils, defined as being super Noble hoppy and virtually no Pils malt sweetness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BeerFMAndy,4.83,"12 oz bottle poured into a Pilsner glass. Enjoy by Jul 20 2012.  A - A dense cloud of white foam rests on top of the crystal clear golden straw yellow beer. Fantastic retention keeps the pile afloat, lightly applying collars of lace to the glass.  S - Enticing, crisp mineral sulfur traces flow through out the beer while a hint of lemon citrus comes from herbal and floral German hops. Crisp overall, a sweet pilsner malt base brings Prima Pils, one of the closest-to-classic American-brewed pilsners to a close.  T - Intensely crisp, Prima Pils abandons the majority of the pilsner malt sweetness that was in the nose for a plain pale malt that bows to the hop additions; herbal and floral with back-end citrus zest while plenty of sulfur still carries through into the flavor as well.  M - Bone dry, Victory's Prima Pils has a balanced but bitter finish that briefly lingers on the tongue before subsiding to faint sulfur and citrus. Light-bodied with moderate-to-high carbonation, this beer is easily quaffable.  O - Victory's Prima Pils arrests nearly all malt interaction, focusing heavily on the German noble hops and their delicate floral and herbal characteristics.

T: Based of smell I wasn't expecting anything special from this beer. I thought it was going to taste like a plain, boring AAL. Once you take a sip you are flattered with this surprise burst of hops. Very simple flavor profile. Nothing really upfront, but a nice bitter blast on the backend.  M: Great carbonation aiding in that crisp, easy-going feel. Doesn't coat the mouth or throat and just slides on down. Perfect.  O: Maybe the six pack I bought was old, but if the beer actually left some lacing and actually had a head this would be an A beer for me.

Fresh with a great blend of citrus and grassy hops & light pilsner malts. There's a hint of sweetness & floral notes and overall the beer is light and refreshing without coming across as weak or bland.  Grassy hops & citrus initially, alongside some spice & refreshing lemon flavors. A light malt base & hints of sweetness followed by a subtly bitter finish.  Smooth & light bodied with good carbonation with a light bitterness. There is a good balance throughout & the beer was incredibly easy to drink as a pilsner should be.  A great pilsner & definitely up there with some of the best of the style I have tried, in fact it could very possible be the best of the style I have tried.

Bready malts, caramel, a touch of lemon and grapefruit with wonderful notes of pine and floral and fresh hops. Slight touch of roast as well. The hop flavors are delicate, yet powerful somehow.

345,1010,bushwik,4.08,I'll have to echo many of the other reviewers that this is certainly not a German Pils by any stretch of the imagination. It is however a SOLID offering from the always consistent Victory stable. I liken this to a consistancy of a Zwickel actually although it is not unfiltered is has a much more syrupy and hop forward flavor then a crisp and clear German Pils lager would. It is however highly sessionable and incredibly flavorful for a lager of its kind and I could put down a few of these easily on a warm day.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Beer poured pale gold with a nice white head that is hanging around nicely.  Nose is sweet cereal malts.  Taste is sweet cereal malts with no hint of cloying, lemon, and pepper. Malts and hops work together harmoniously with the peppery hops lingering in the end.  Mouthfeel is light and the beer is well carbonated. Strangely enough there is a nice smoothness to this brew.  Overall this brew rocks! I enjoy the Gordon Biersch Czech Pils before attending Coyote hockey games and it has been a favorite until now!

345,1010,felsenpils,2.43,"Prima Pils is rather dark for the style, yet has a nice fluffy head when poured into a glass. What hits you first is the hop aroma. The taste is also hop-accented to the point that I cannot appreciate the malt body. I am not sure why dry hopping has invaded every beer style on the planet, since it was never intended for most of them. Prima pils is a solid American micro pilsener, but certainly not a ""German Pilsner"" as they say on their website. It is way too far out of balance. I taste great potential in this beer, but it lets me down in being just another blast of hops like a run of the mill west coast IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,fps_dean,4.05,"Pours a nice golden color with little head. Has a very grainy, malty aroma, with a hint pine and lemon. Tastes very much like it smells, with a malty flavor initially, and some floral hop and lemony taste that comes later. No overwhelming taste of alcohol, and it goes down very smoothly.  Overall, a very good German Pilsner and a great session beer. Will certainly become a regular in the warmer weather.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

The head persists fairly well before dissipating and leaving lace trails about the glass. The liquid is a pale golden or blonde, clear and doesn't show much carbonation. It looks crisp.  There's a pretty big aroma on this beer, so much so that I was catching whiffs the moment I opened the glass. It's heavy on sweet, honey-like maltiness, with a bitter tartness beneath. There's also a bready quality to the aroma.  I'm liking the lightness on this beer. Feels very delicate on the palate. There's a lemony zest and tartness, with some lingering sweet, breadiness. The finish is dry and bitter and I get some grassy and floral hops. Interestingly, for me at least, I notice a slight yeast feel that reminds me of a Belgian beer. It's subtle though.  Prima Pils is really easy to drink yet there are subtleties to the beer that suggest this isn't a beer to be pounded, despite how easy one could do just that. There's a nice medley of sweet, bitter and yeasty all at play here and I enjoy it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Would definitely use as a session beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Taste matches the nose, with delicate white bread malt perfectly balanced with peppery, slightly citric (lemon) hops. Flavors are full. Clean. FRESH. Tastes like it was bottled yesterday.  M - Light bodied, with a dry finish. Slightly fizzy carbonation. Perfect for the style.  O - Simply the best pilsner I have ever tasted. It's not only about what's there, but also about what's NOT there; no stale, skunky, or ""off"" flavors, just clean pilsner taste in a richer package than expected.

Smell- Bready but still has a definite floral aroma coming through with citrus.  Taste- Has some of the classic biscuit-like maltiness up front but quickly develops into a sweet citrus with notes of orange. This develops into a great taste of hoppy spicy flavor. The great punch of hops lingers for awile.  Mouthfeel- Medium in body and has a great amount of carbonation. Dry finish.  Overall- I was impressed. This was refreshing and very drinkable. The reason I was impressed was because the appearance had that of a lager, but did not taste like one. Had a nice amount of complexity as well.

It must be a chill haze because this is supposed to be a filtered beer but it does not look like it.  The aroma is of grainy malts, husks, grits, yeast, citrus, and a clean hop note on the backside. It echoes most of what is to be expected from a German pilsener.  Medium body with a smooth texture.

Appearance - Pours a towering golden crystal clear body with a steady stream of bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass to replenish an ample stark white head. The foam is two fingers thick and fluffy, like cotton candy. Retention is excellent and it leaves nice sticky residue and rings as I drink it down. A prototypical looking German Pils.  Smell - Bright and clean, with light biscuity notes blending with subtle hoppy bitterness and herbal grass notes and lemon zest. Bready and light, like fresh flatbread and butter crackers, with just enough acidity to keep it sharp to the nose.  Taste - Much like the smell, light malts and bready tones dominate alongside a bouquet of faint floral tones and lemony essence, but no sourness. Perhaps a hit of tart, but that could be my perception playing tricks on me from the non-tart zest characteristic. On the finish is a pleasant bitterness that provides a counterpoint to the softer grain notes. There is a faint amount of sweetness as well to bring the flavors all together.  Mouthfeel - Crisp, light bodied, with ample carbonation and a slightly sweet finish. Significant tingling effect from the carbonation to offset the softness of the flavors.  Overall, an outstanding German pils. Although I must admit to a sweet spot in my heart for this style, this one is an exceptional example that hits all the notes one would expect from a world-class lager.

Huge carbonation coming up from the bottom. Great lacing as the beer is drunk- laced all the way down the glass.  Smell: Bitter floral hops. Very clean. The hops are assertive, but down beat you over the head. That being said, you can't smell much else in the nose.  Taste: This is where this beer is special. There is a powerful, upfront hoppiness about it that ushers in a bready, bitter pilsener aftertaste. This is an incredible blend of flavoring and bittering hops, and both compliment each other quite well. The different phases (hoppy up front, bitter/bready on the back) was most pronounced when starting the beer, but by the end, the tastes had converged into a masterful hopped up pilsnery bready bitterness. This beer finishes dry. A phenomenal, complex taste.  Mouthfeel: Excellent carbonation for the style leads to a crisp ""erfrischende"" mouthfeel.  Overall: This is a phenomenal beer. It looks like the internet suggests that this gem has an IBU in the low-to-mid forties. This is not unlike hoppier German pilseners from Germany, such as Jever, Waldhaus, Alpirsbacher, or Rothaus. Rothaus Pils (Tannenzäpfle) is one of my favorite all-time beers, so that this beer comes close is extremely exciting. A fantastic brew, and one I am planning on buying in greater quantities.

Spotty and stringy lace stick to the glass and a swirl effortlessly revives a finger back to the surface.  The aroma is very grassy and herbal. Faint lemony appeal with zest and pith. A bit of grainy sweet undertone but the aroma is mostly dominated by a noble hop grassiness.  Taste is much more aggressive with grassy and herbal bitterness than you might expect. Almost a lemony zest quality hints towards a feeling of perfume and minorly fruity alcohol that is oily and pithy. Very subtle suggestions of straw-like grain that is fresh.

345,1010,Wyattldavis,4.33,"Great beer! Not overpowering. Golden appearance, with a clean finish and very refreshing. Definitely not too sweet/not too much alcohol content. The hops are just right - present but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is extraordinary - big, clear crisp carbonation that isn't fizzy and feels just right. I could see this being one of my standards - especially in the summer. One of my favorite beers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

A - a shade below gold with a fluffy mousse like head.  S - clean with lots of earthy and noble hops present.  T - for a pilsner, this has some great depth. Big spicy and bitter hops were found but the malt was still present.  M - not much in the way of carbonation.

Streams of micro bubbles rise from the bottom. I would have given this a 5 if the head was bigger.  S - Scents of mellow grassy and earth hops. Grains and biscuit malt, followed by spicy hops.  T - There is quite a bit of taste going on in this Pils. The combination of German malts and hops yield a very flavorful beer. Grains, grass, earth, spice, and bitterness are waking my palate.  M - As others have noted, the carbonation was a bit lacking for the style. Light bodied with a slight soapiness.  O - My review may not seem to show how much I enjoy this Pilsener. It is a very nice take on the style.

The nobel hops really shine through adding some spicy/herbal character. The carbination is just right with a nice dry finish.  O - Extremely drinkable beer, yet there is nothing that blows me away.

I'd like to taste it blind vs other top pils like Oskar, Urquell, etc.  Victory is a top east coast brewery, consistent, clean, and surprising without wobbly out of balance brews. Bravo! You must try them!  A: Poured into pint glass, luscious white head, faded fast not much, but a little dotty lacing, the tiny bubbles I recall from my Dad's first beers when I was a kid rising in a tall glass.  S: Hops and citrus, but so much more subtle than our hoppier beers. Perfume, lemon, grass, herbs. Crisp, floral, ""the smell of a woman in the sunshine"".  Taste: Very appetizing and dry. Starts refreshing fresh bread crust; grows into a tingle of hoppy bitterness with grassy and herbal over tones, finally a super crisp, clean finish. Lovely arc, lovely appetizer and with food: Oysters, clams, sausage, brats, fish, crabs.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied with lots of carbonation, but that oh so subtle pilsner tingle and finish, light and airy and summery, also a kissing kind of beer. Your mouth just feels good all over.

There's citrus and yeastiness. Three thumbs up. M--Creamy & fulfilling. Excellent feel, not ""refreshing"", but you'll want more. O--Another win for Victory.

Slight hops  Taste: Fairly dry. Probably due to the hops that make this finish very bitter. But it's such a thirst quenching bitter my mouth waters for another sip. Slightly grainy. Maybe like a dry crackerbread.  Mouthfeel: Light but assertive.  Overall: One of the best pilsners I have tried. That being said I haven't had a lot. I'm fairly new to the lager scene in general.

This beer is to Pilsner what IPA is to Pale ale. I didn't get enough balance of malt, in fact the hops kind of drowned out the flavors of the pilsner malts in this one. The final reason I didnt rate this beer higher was the ABV.

Really highlights the noble hops with spicy, slightly piney flavors. Malt bill keeps it simple with lightly toasted malts. Fairly bitter finish. While this beer has a very developed, excellent noble hop flavor, it stays simple and refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Light, crisp, extremely refreshing. Highly, highly drinkable.

345,1010,Stevedore,4.18,"12oz bottle, no clear bottling date found on the bottle. Got this from Matt from Pennsylvania; would imagine this is relatively fresh. Poured into a New Glarus pilsner glass today, 7/28/2013.  This beer pours a lovely clear golden colour with a ton of fizzy noise and a fluffy head that builds up instantly, and slowly dissipates over the course of five minutes. It is an absolutely gorgeous, clean looking beer. The glass's Wisconsin etch at the bottom does a nice job of releasing more bubbles to the surface, forming a bubbly film once the head is gone. The lacing is sticky and soapy where it sticks.  Just smelling this beer is refreshing. A good bit of lemon zest and grassy hops. A spicy and grainy sweetness permeates the nose. Not a complicated nose, but definitely does what its intended to do- smell refreshing.  It tastes like a sweet lemon zest with a clean, refreshing grassy bitterness that makes my tongue shiver. There is a bit of underlying spiciness to the flavour which is a great addition.. but for the most part this is an aggressively hopped lager. Tastes deliciously clean and hoppy. The feel of this beer is about right for the style- lighter bodied, very well carbonated, clean tasting and refreshing. Aftertaste of spicy grassy hoppy bitterness that sticks for a good while. Again this is clean and refreshing.  A very nice example of an American take on the German pilsner style. Delicious, refreshing and not expensive. Would recommend to anyone who wants a good, easy to find lager.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ryan1788a5,4.18,"12oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass.  A: Dull straw color. Great clarity. A big rocky head retains very well at two fingers in the narrow glass. Foamy clumps or lacing.  S: Grainy, doughy malt base. Leafy and herbal hops with a bit of fruit thrown in- lemon and lime leaf. Lightly spicy. Aromatic and pleasant.  T: Stiff punch of herbal and spicy hop bitterness latches onto the palate on the attack. Oily, leafy, and spicy. An aggressive use of Noble hops. Perhaps a touch of sulfur beneath the bitterness. Suggestion of lemon pith, lime leaf, and grape leaf far in the background. Doughy and grainy malt base. Very bitter, spicy, and oily on the finish.  M: Light in body with a sharp, crisp carbonation. Slight firmness from the malt and a moderate oily and astringent hop feel.  O: The pilsner style can be known for its sharp herbal hop bitterness, but this one pushes the envelope further than most. Not sure what we're looking at for IBUs, but the perceived bitterness is very high. This is easily the biggest, boldest pilsner I've come across (discounting some ridiculous 'imperial' pilsners). It's damn tasty, and the bite really wakes up the drinker, like in old movies when someone smacks a hysterical person in the face and yells ""Snap out of it!"" ""Thanks, I needed that,"" would be my reply. Pairing options are interesting. Perhaps a fishy ceviche, or some herbal Mediterranean dishes. Spicy Italian sausage is a no-brainer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Lovely, vibrant yellow with barely a finger of lacing at the top. Looks excellent in the glass.  Spicy and herbal on the nose. Hops really come through. Well rounded smell to compliment the bright appearance.  Mouthfeel is awesome. Heavier than I expected for a pils, but balanced. Hops really come through and make the brew come alive. Yeasty, bread flavors come to mind first. Then you get the herb that we saw in the smell. It finishes with a spicy hop punch and lingers... In a good way.  Overall, this one is up there on my list and I'm not a pils drinker. This will be my go to for grilling from now on. Refreshing and very drinkable, but with lots of character.

Pilsners aren't my favs - I lean heavily to IPAs and bigger bodied beers, but Victory - a brewery I very much admire - has produced a lovely beverage that any beer lover of any style should enjoy.  The abundant head was thick as shaving cream but rapidly dissipated in the standard pub pint into which I'd poured it. Modest wisps of lacing. Light, bright, clear amber body.  Nose was fresh, for me predominantly malty, noticable hops, but clean, lively, eniticing.. ""Drink me. Soon.""  What struck me first and hardest was the dryness, followed by the full foamy mouthfeel and full but elegant body. Then the slightly tart to bitter finish. Citrusy notes, lovely balance, and overall impact of ""I'm sorry I bought only two in a sixpack sampler. I'd like some more, please."" Others have mentioned a somewhat sweet attack: my palate didn't discover this. Again, the flavorful dryness of the beer is why I'll stock this regularly.

The head recedes quickly, but the carbonation maintains some bubbles that lead to very light lacing on the glass.  S - Mostly grassy qualities, some sweetness. The aroma is stronger than I would expect from a pilsener, but right in line with what I would hope for.  T - Follows the nose. Grassiness up front with a little bit of light malt. Hesitate to call it sweet, but it clearly shifts away from the grassy taste. Next transition is to very round bitterness. Very nice finish.  M - The best part of this beer, and the part that accentuates some of the nice flavors. It's pillowy up front, which allows the full flavors to bubble throughout the mouth. It feel medium-bodied. Then it moves on to one of the cleanest finishes I've seen in a long time. My mouth waters for a considerable length of time.  O - This compares favorably against the best pilseners I've ever tasted.

345,1010,falloutsnow,4.05,"From: Binny's, Champaign, IL Date: Best by 2013-06-24 Glass: Ayinger willi glass  Prima Pils is an enjoyable German-style pilsner with a solid continental hop presence in both bitterness and flavor, which still lets some of the German pilsner malts to peek through as well. Easily drinkable for those who enjoy a bit more hop presence in their pilsners, this is an easy-go to for any time of the year.  Pours a brilliantly white-colored head, composed of small-sized bubbles that are packed densely together, giving a very frothy appearance. Retention is slightly above average, lasting about 1.5 minutes, fading to a thin cap of lace atop the body of the beer. Lacing is fairly good, consisting of small patterns and webs clinging to about a third of the glass' interior. The beer's body is a hazy (25-40% opaque) golden-orange color, light changing the hue to a bright, though pale, golden-yellow color. Carbonation is visible rising from the depths of the glass, sparse in number, but fairly quick to rise.  Aroma of notable continental hops right away, lending modest lemon, herbal and floral qualities, while the pilsner malt is not discounted either: the graininess and malty sweetness readily detectable in the background (perhaps a bit easier here since the bottle is nearly a month after its best-by date).  Front of palate finds pleasantly grainy and fresh pilsner malt flavors with a bit of light caramelized sugar sweetness (from Maillard reactions during the boil?) and hints of floral and lemon-like hops. Mid-palate of notable continental hop bitterness with attendant flavors of light lemon citrus, floral hoppiness with a slightly woodsy and herbal presence, and an underlying presence of grainy, slightly hot cereal-like pilsner malt that also contributes enough counterbalancing sweetness to make this work. Back of palate finds continued strong, clean (sharp? clear?) continental hop bitterness with undertones of herbal and light lemon citrus hop flavors and grainy pilsner malt. Aftertaste is of substantial hop bitterness, with herbal and floral qualities not far behind, along with hints of citric tartness and residual, slightly caramelized sugar sweetness from the malts.  Beer is of medium weight, with low to medium-low levels of carbonation, leading to a beer that softly, gradually foams up on the palate, then quickly settles to a smooth and slightly placid existence as it moves across the tongue. Never watery, but a bit more carbonation would suit this beer nicely. Closes very dry, with light stickiness remaining on the palate.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Light to medium body with good carbonation. A hoppy pilsner with character and superb flavor, in my opinion superior to most German and Czech pilsners.

Lemongrass, herbal leafiness, and some earthy richness. Extremely clean, toasty malt provides a nice backdrop to the hops, and there's nary a hint of sulfurous lager yeast to be found. Crisp, aromatic, and well-rounded. Truly remarkable.  T: Opens with a balance of bready malt and leafy hops, with more lemony citrus building in midway through. Delicious bittersweet earthiness toward the finish, and a supremely bitter, grapefruity aftertaste. The aftertaste is a little harsh, but other than that it's terrific.

345,1010,SerialTicker,3.69,"Best by October 9th 2013... since that's five months away, my assumption is that this beer is probably very fresh.  Appearance: It looks like any other pilsener would -- a crystal clear yellow color. As many would affectionately refer to it as, it looks like piss. Not much lacing small white ring on top. Looks pretty ordinary.  Smell: A lot of hay, and also grain. As there's a big hop on the logo of this beer, I was expecting a pretty nice hop presence, and there *is* one. It's not so big that it morphs this into some sort of pilsener/IPA hybrid, but it's more than welcome -- especially in the taste.  Taste: Yeah, probably the best pilsener I've had. It has that typical flavor you'd expect from a pilsener, but the hops lift it up a little bit. This is the most bitter beer I've had from the style, but it's not extreme, which I wouldn't expect. The amount of hops here compliment everything nicely. This is definitely a pilsener for hopheads. The mouthfeel is relatively thin, but has a nice body, given the style. A very good choice for a summer beer.  Not a *super* interesting beer, but it's above average for a pilsener.

Plentiful large-grained head with little retention. Almost no lacing, some visible carbonation.  Very pleasant aroma. Opens up citrusy, slightly metallic, than broader hop aroma with mild floral yeast showing.  Same citrus (lemon) front in the mouth. Followed by a mild but complex hops kick of pine, laurel and licorice. All flavors remain in the finish balanced by a light sweet malt note. After 2 minutes, I can still taste the complex hops blend, including citrus and aromatics, yeast and malt. More complexity than most Pilsners.  Very light-bodied front, but then tastes deceptively creamy with moderate carbonation. One side effect of the light body is that it betrays a boozy heat note, however, without being overly dry.  A well made Pils with a lot of balance between all elements, with hoppiness matching of exceeding the classic fresh style.

The aroma is of sweet, lemony malt, some sweetness, and an off, wall paper glue scent. Taste is the same, with lots of bitterness and that unpleasant glue note. I’m also picking up aspirin. Mouthfeel is medium, and Victory Prima Pils finishes mostly dry, citrusy, and off-kilter. Maybe I got some of a bad batch, but I can only say that it is acceptably good, and that’s being generous. Well, one can’t say it’s not interesting.  RJT",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,finstadp,3.54,The Prima Pils from Victory Brewing Company was a pleasant surprise. The beer had a light yellow appearance. It had a smell full of hops and floral notes. The beer had a lighter body mouth feel. The taste was light and earthy with hints of hops.

It smells almost too thick/sweet. A slightly nutty aroma comes out with a swirl, tending towards almond. A slight biscuit is way in the back. The flavor starts with bitter grass then moves to a nutty white bread. There is a nectar like bitterness from noble hops, then it gets really bitter and slightly piney. Definitely out of the style, as it lingers for a while. Feel is very slightly watery with a balanced finish.  This is just too grassy and bitter. Chlorophyll comes to mind.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,Sam21,4.05,I've had this beer many times and it is a standout in the field of pilsners. The clear golden body sits beneath an thick sudsy white head. Excellent retention and nice lacing. The aroma is filled with herbal hops that exhibit a touch of citrus. Bready malt. Clean. The flavor follows suit. Bready malt and a blast of cutting bitterness. No sweetness. Nice sharp bite to the finish. It's really nicely structured and has plenty of character.  A wonderful anytime beer - and a more heavily hopped pilsner.

345,1010,ChugMan,4.55,"Important note: Make sure not to drink this below the recommended serving temp, otherwise the flavor will be utterly ruined. If anything, err on the warmer side rather than colder!  Food Pairing: Beef bulgogi with spicy kimchi paired beautifully with this Pils. Being a sweetish soy/ garlic sauce, Bulgogi is an odd one to pair, but the spice of the kimchi along with it created a terrific foil for the honey, floral & strong hop traits of the beer. A - Pristine light yellow. Moderate head settled to a thin but even froth which left some fine lacing. S - Some clover, sugar cookies. Very nice. T - An amazing abundance of fresh honey and a faceful of clover - love at first sip! Light creamyness leads to a very clean finish. M - Crisp, spicy hops dance around the mouth like fireworks.

Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, floral, grass, cracker, pepper, light pine, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with a good balance of hops and fruity lager esters. Taste of big lemon, orange zest, apple, pear, pepper, pine, floral, grass, cracker, bread, hop earthiness, and floral spiciness. Good amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, floral, pepper, grass, cracker, bread, hop earthiness, and floral spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance with good complexity; with a very hoppy flavor profile; and nearly zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish.

There's some floral and citrus in the hops along with the hay like hops from pilsners.  The flavor has a familiar pilsner grassy taste with a bitter finish. The floral and citrus hops as well.  As good as it is, it still doesn't blow my mind. I don't really have it miles ahead of other pilsners like other reviewers have.

Previously I had multiple ratings of this beer due to serving types (bottle, tap). I'm just having this in a bottle now and it's just as damn good. Highly recommended. Almost hoppy pale ale in character, but with the pilsner touch.  On-tap at Stone Brewery.  Yellow and very pils-looking, don't know if it was a careful pour or not but there wasn't much head, however there was some lacing and plenty of rising bubbles.  Had a lemony and grainy accent to an overall crispy hops aroma.  Taste wise it was plenty of citrus, toasty bready malts, lots of smooth and tasty hops, and plenty of lemony citrus.

Not a lot of corn or honey flavor in this one. lingering hop bitterness in the aftertaste maybe because of the whole hops ?  Mouthfeel- dry with a good carb level although the hops in the end really do linger.  Overall- I maybe shouldn't have tasted this before work, The hops really stick around.

Notes: This beer follows the style guide very well, and so I score it high accordingly. But I guess Pils just isn't my thing.

345,1010,Jugs_McGhee,3.44,"Was in the mood for a good pils and I'd seen the high ratings on this one so I picked up a sixer here in SoCal for $10.99. Reviewed live. Expectations are high.  Not paired with food.  Served straight from the fridge and side-poured into a Samuel Smith's conical pint glass.  A: Pours a one finger white colour head, fairly thin, with some light cream. Retention is above average. Body colour is a predictable clear light yellow-copper. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Decent lacing as the head recedes. Typical of the style; this is standard fare so far.  Sm: Fresh full clean barley and pale malts. Crisp and refreshing. A bit of floral hop character. No yeast character. No alcohol is detectable. An above average strength aroma. Par for the course. It's appealing.  T/Mf: Ah. Now we're getting somewhere. Fresh full-bodied clean barley and pale malts. Complementary floral hopping gives it a bit more depth. Some crystal malt. The softness of the mouthfeel is a highlight, and what sets this beer apart from other pilsners in my opinion. Smooth, wet, and refreshing, with a bit of dryness and a dash of lemongrass on the climax. A bit coarse in the second act, bringing out the flavour. The mouthfeel is the best aspect of this beer and feels carefully balanced with the flavour profile; it's very nectary but I'd stop short of calling it sweet or cloying. It's disappointingly simple, but it's also got more depth than many (German) pilsners. I do like it. A refreshing pleasant pilsner. Very well balanced and executed, though it's a bit too bitter for the style (likely from slight overhopping, which also gives it a bit more floral flavour). It lacks subtlety, but there are some more refined notes here.  Dr: As easy to drink as any pilsner out there. Would pair great with food. I wouldn't get it again with Pilsner Urquell so readily available, but it's a good offering from Victory, and it's nice to see craft breweries attempting lighter easier to drink styles. I'll easily kill my sixer, and I think it's well priced as an East coast import.  High B-  *** 05/20/18 impression from a can:  ""Malt: Pilsner. Hops: Hallertau, Tettnang, Saaz, Spalt Select. ABV: 5.3%""   Assertively hopped, drinking more like a Noble hopped IPL than a pilser proper. Still, the use of all 4 Noble hop varietals instead of American hops keeps it somewhat traditional and some drinkers will find it more flavorful than rigidly traditional expressions of the pilsner style.  I'd sooner go for a Czech pilsner since this seems to crumble under the weight of its unchecked bitterness (particularly in the 3rd act and on the finish), but I can see why many regard it as one of the best American-brewed pilsners out there. For those who have adjusted to the extreme hop bitterness increasingly showcased by popular beers in the U.S.A, Denmark, and the like, I can see how this would seem mild.

345,1010,spoony,3.83,"From a 12 oz bottle into a pils glass.  A-An average pour produced about one finger of shiny, white foam that settled pretty quickly. The beer was straw-yellow in color and clear. A few big, chunky bubbles of carbonation were visible. Pretty true to style.  S-The brew gives off whiffs of biscuity malts, a touch of dry yeast and some spicy, grassy hop notes. Nothing crazy here, but nothing bad, either.  T-The taste is grassy and slightly hoppy up front. The mid-palate is grainy and biscuity, and more pils like. The finish is slightly bitter with a hoppy bite to cap it all off. Definitely more hops than a typical pils, which makes for a unique flavor. The beer loses a point or two for a slightly soapy taste that never completely disappears.  M-My bottle was a touch flat for the style. The feel was lighter to medium bodied and easily drinkable.  O-Its January, but the sun is out, so I figured I would break up the stout/strong ale parade with a pils, and this was a good choice. It wasn't the best beer I have tasted, probably not even close to the best pils I have tasted, but the little hoppy kick keeps this from feeling like just another light, fizzy beer.

I was expecting more hops like an esb based purely on smell but it is a hoppy pils or a weak esb. The mouth feel is medium but I am not a huge pilsner fan. I like bigger body beers.

A touch of malt sweetness and clean yeast, but the hops steal the show.  Taste: Strong bitterness up front followed by a strong spicy and herbal hop character with some citrusy notes on the finish. The malt helps cut some of the bitterness by adding a sweet, peachy breadiness and slight toastiness, but the hops are incredibly intrusive. The hop character is explosive!  Mouthfeel: Very thin, as with all in the style, but does have a nice carbonation pop that dries out the mouth and lets the hop flavors linger.  Overall: A truly epic lager, an absolutely huge noble hop character that has gone unrivaled by anything past my taste buds. The balance is way off, and many will find it off-putting, but if hops and sessionability are what you want, then this will do the trick.

Smell - Aroma of strong citrus hop notes, slightly grassy, and with hints of grain.  Taste - Starts grainy and with a moderate citrus hop, but by mid-taste a high hop bitterness, evoking thoughts of grass and Rio Star Texas grapefruit peel, takes hold and sky rockets this pilsener into pure hop bomb territory. Finishes with that lingering grapefruit bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Light to medium body with lively carbonation. Finishes crisp and somewhat dry.

345,1010,JamesMN,3.8,"Appearance: Translucent neon yellow with visible carbonation. One finger soapy white head.  Aroma: A little skunk from the hops (in a good way). A touch of grain.  Taste: Pretty clean. The grain and hops work really well together here. The grain flavor comes through at first and smoothly transitions into a clean hop bite in the finish and a lingering bitterness. There is an nice sweetness in there as well but doesn't last long. There is a slight lemon peel/citrus taste from the hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Decently smooth and a little above average drinkability.  Final Thoughts: The overall smoothness of this beer caught me by surprise. BMC beers tend to give Pilseners a bad name, but Prima Pils definitely restores that style to how it aught to be considered. Would I drink it again? It's likely, at 5.3% ABV it's even sessionable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Theheroguy,4.25,A light copper colored and well carbonated brew. Prima pils has a wonderful hop aroma very enticing. The hops flavors are very noticeable and at the forefront of this beer. I think that this beer is almost too carbonated which detracts from the mouth feel in my opinion. For this style I would appreciate a little less carbonation in order for the beer to flow more smoothly. A crisp dry finish makes the perfect end for this brew.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Darkmagus82,3.73,"Poured from bottle into pint glass  Appearance – Pours a golden colored brew with huge white head. The head has great retention, eventually fading to give a lighter level of lacing.  Smell – The smell is a mix of a grainy and a light grapefruit citrus. Beyond that there is a small amount of a pine hop smell.  Taste – The taste starts out of a malty grain flavor with some light sweetness. As the taste advances, some lemon and a grapefruit hop flavor come to the tongue. These two tastes (grapefruit and lemon) intensify as the taste moves on, although they never get too strong. In the end the hop, combined with the wheat and a newly arriving bitter earthy and grassy hop flavor, create a dry, bitter, wheat flavor to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer was on light to medium side with a carbonation level that was on the average side. Both were quite nice as they suited the dry flavors and transitions well as well as made for a very drinkable brew.  Overall – A nice refreshing, bitter beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Tastes refreshing and crisp as it looks, with an impressive distinct taste I can only hope to compare with other renowned pilsner styles as I eventually try them. I've had this as a go-to session beer for a few years now simply because it's refreshing and original, with a grassy/ spiced flavor that's as tasty as I could hope for. It must help that I love hops, as apparently this is quite bitter even for German pilsner standards. Again this beer shines as far as mouthfeel goes. Smooth carbonation, perfect crispness, finely balanced drinking here. Due to the hops usage here, I suspect if I try every other example of this style, I'd still come back to this one as my tops.

It's not an exotic aroma but at the same time it makes me want to gulp this thing down. I mostly fast the malts from this with some herbal hoppy notes and a hint of lemon. This is thin bodied, very crisp and dry. It leaves a herbal like aftertaste. Prima Pils is a very tasty thin bodied beer.

Scent is mild with hops, wheat, yeast, and hints of citrus. The taste is initially a sweet wheat tone that turns wet and slightly dry on the palette. Texture is smooth and refreshing as the beer is fairly complex for a pilsner. Leaves a slight chalky after taste. Not bad at all.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BryanCarey,4.23,"Prima Pils pours to a yellowish- straw color with a nice, white head of foam and an aroma that is one of light pepper, biscuits, grassiness, and lemons. The body of the beer is just slightly hazy and the beer leaves some decent lacing as you consume.  Tasting this beer proves even better than the appearance would lead you to believe. The flavor of this beer is a delight to the senses, offering tastes like biscuits, dough, bread, pale malt, citrus, and herbs. The spiciness in the finish is evident, but it doesn’t overwhelm and the taste is actually rather balanced overall with an aftertaste that returns to that of biscuits and dough.  Victory Brewing makes many fine products and Prima Pils is one of the finest. I find myself sipping, evaluating, and continuing to find more and more complex flavors. Everything from the initial sip through the aftertaste is memorable and quite remarkable.

345,1010,Kurt_Boss,2.47,"My score is way off the norm, but notice how the high ratings tend to agree that this beer is a breed of its own. It makes for a difficult review because it doesn't taste like other pils. Should we treat it as just a beer, or as a particular attempt at the style? I fall on the side of judging to the standard, so please take that into consideration. This receives only a 2.5 (below average!) from me, but it gets this score as a pils. Without regard to style, it's easily a high 3's to low 4's.  This is a pils for an IPA fan. I happen to be a big fan of double IPA's, so this particular beer suits me--but, my take away is it is far too bitter for a pils.  This is a tasty beer, please don't misunderstand me. The problem is that this beer style is supposed to be an easy drinking, low ABV, refreshing brew. A good pils, in my book anyway, is clear, crisp, and thirst quenching; however, this beer is more inline with an experience such as you'll find with a good IPA.  With all that out of the way here's my take.  Served from bottle. I don't care about glass type, so I'm not noting it.  The smell is citrus, hops, and a faint hint of what many will consider skunk. (Don't worry it's not skunked, lagers are aged...a tiny hint of skunk is not a fault!)  Appearance is below average for a pils. It should be clear enough to see through, while the Prima, as many have noted, is cloudy for quiet a while. The carbonation, head, and lacing are perfect examples of what a pils should be--in this regard of appearance Victory has done a great job. Too bad for the clarity!  The mouthfeel is too think and creamy for the style. While no porter or malty bock, it simply is a little too thick. As noted previously, the carbonation is pleasant and what you expect from a pils.  The taste is the real downfall for Prima Pils as a pils. While the style should be refreshing and crisp, low enough ABV to tip several back in a session, the hops will just stick with you. This tastes like an IPA. Not an overly hopped IPA, but it's bitter, and the bitterness does not leave the back of your palate for quite some time.  Overall: This falls below average for a pils. I'm sorry to say, a typical macro pils is simply superior to this for the style.  Final words. Try this beer if you like IPA's. You may just find the lager you've been looking for. You get the hoppiness of a good IPA with the great head of a true pils. Taken in this regard, you'll find much to enjoy, just don't judge it as a pils.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,NardiByNature,4.35,"Longtime favorite, first time review. Biased? Probably. I'll try my best to be objective.  Pours very yellow with a small white head. Retention clings throughout the duration of its stay in my glass. Leaves behind some soapy lacing. Nice clarity, nice color.  Usual suspects permeate the nose: fresh cut grass and a little lemon zest. It’s lack of “spiciness” stands out a bit when I think about other pilsners.  It tastes ultra fresh: probably a lot to do with the hops. Earthy, grassy, crisp. For a pils, there’s plenty of hop action, which suits me well. As in the nose, there seems to be subdued spiciness but it does make a nice appearance in the aftertaste. The malt profile makes me think of rye bread. Not too dry, not too slick.  Really very good. I went into the liquor store yesterday (Choice Mart on Mass. Ave.) and spent some time perusing their selection – dece for a liquor store.

The hops take center stage over the pils malt backbone.  T: Plain and simple, this is a pilsner that thinks its an IPA. Lots of hop flavor and bitterness abound. Grass and earth are the initial flavors, before giving way to black pepper, grapefruit rind, lemon zest, and pine notes on the finish and aftertaste.

T - Same as smell, touch of sweet apple or pear then some pretty good hop bitterness that is quite enjoyable.  F - Needs more carbonation imo, just a tad would make this awesome, will try another, maybe this had a bit of carbonation let out of it.

345,1010,thecheapies,4.2,"Prima Pils. Best before July 20th, 2012. Poured into my recently acquired Founders pint glass (thanks Mad Mex Robinson and Pittsburgh Craft Beer Week!).  Bright gold in color with tremendous clarity. Some rising bubble action. Fluffy off-white head with a mottled top. Sticky and clinging despite leftover water from the glass rinse. Looks fab. 4.0  Citric hops and earthy hops provide a sweet and spicy hop aroma. Some mustiness from the grains with little or no yeast character, in other words, very crisp. Hints of orange peel, lemon, and fresh herbs. 4.0  Big zesty hop burst at the beginning. Parallels with a spicy finish, as well. Very dry in the middle-to-end. Husky grains, citric fruit peels, and herbal notes make for one avant-garde, but tasty pilsner! Love the spice from bittering whole-leaf hops. 4.5  Easy to throw down. Would have like a little more carbonation to keep it sudsy and amplify the spiciness of the hops, but this is just fine. Full-on body for a pilsner. 4.0  Possibly my favorite domestic pilsner, and one of my favorite domestic lagers. One of the best finishing beers I've ever had. Great stuff. 4.0",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Aroma of freshy cut grass and lemon waft up from the glass. Also some flowers with a little grain.  The flavor starts out with plenty of bread and a little bit of biscuit. Grassy hops quickly swoop in along with a stronger bitterness than I was expecting. This leads to an very dry, clean finish with lingering bitterness.  Wow this really is an amazing beer. It is extremely refreshing and an awesome thirst quencher. The bitterness might be a little high for a pilsener but it works very well in this beer.

A: Straw, yellow color with a touch of haze, unimpressive retention and lacing in the soapy white head. Maybe a touch darker than you're standard BMC.  S: Crisp pilsner malt and bready sweetness, hints of orange, lemongrass, touch of an herbal hop oil, very faint. Decent crisp citrus zest hop presence for a pils.  T: Lots of crisp pilsner malt, a bit biscuity but there is malt sweetness as well, a touch of honey...lemon zest, grassy hops, floral, crisp, light, and clean.  MF: Light body, clean, moderate carbonation, crisp mouthfeel.  O: Pleasant, maybe a go to beer in the summer but I can't see myself searching it out again.

S - Lemon, grass, hops and some light biscuity notes.  T - Initially, this is as if I am biting into a biscuit. A number of malts really characterize this beer. The other notes are much more subtle. Some hints of flowers and a presence from the hops, but not overly bitter. Not really my cup of tea, but well done.  M - Beautifully done in this category. A nice medium body and superb carbonation. The beer makes its mark and then recedes leaving a nice thin coating behind on your palette.  O - This is not a style I traditionally enjoy but this is the best I have ha in the class.

T - Pale malt, lots of lemon, grass, herbal, honey and a nice finish of tartness and lemon zest bitterness, which lingers long into the dry aftertaste.  M - Light-medium body and medium-high carbonation. Lightly chewy at first then crsip and refreshing.  O - I like enough to make it part of my beer rotation. It's refreshing, has a lowish ABV but also has a lot of flavor, especially the bright lemon citrus and dry, spicy finish. Bolder than a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (another one in my regular rotation) but not quite as well balanced. I like this better than the Sierra Nevada Summerfest or the Stoudts Pils after tasting them side-by-side. Also, while this has a 1% higher ABV than my #1 session beer, 21st Amendment's Bitter American, as of late, this is capturing a bigger portion of my beer budget than in previous years.

Not too bitter, just more assertive than with most pilsners. The finish is quite dry and flowery with a nice lingering herbal character, leaving the palate ready for more.  A nice distinct pilsner. I have had a few in recent days and this one definitely tastes different. I can see why it's rated so highly in its' category.

I'm not sure how people can call this a pilsner with a straight face. for the style, the bitterness and profile are way to extreme/off. It's getting really annoying how americans add hops to every damn style of beer and then rave about how awesome it is. nuking beers with hops does not make it better.

A little fruit on the nose and some more later. I like the sourness at the end as well, and the little bit of burnt toast - just enough to detect, not enough to throw the flavor off.

This pours a clear yellow with a steady stream of bubbles rising. On the nose there is the characteristic wet grain nose but also a good deal more noble hop presence than other beers in the style. In the mouth there is a clean grain, dry, mixing with floral and earthy hops. The body is perfect medium light, and this is hugely drinkable.  Overall this is a fine beer in a style where the brews can tend to run together. The slight extra hop character really makes this stand out, and the drinkability would keep me coming back if I had regular access.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

A small amount of pine in the background but the hops are mostly earthy/floral. The malts have a nice cereal smell.  Taste: A nice amount of bitterness to balance out the very tasty malts. A bit of honey noted in the taste as well. A tiny bit of soap quality to the hops, like I enjoy in pilseners.  Mouthfeel: Medium to thin, but this one should not be thick.

Yellow gold color and brilliantly clear.  Aroma: Initial slight sulfer smell (appropriate for style) in the nose that gives way to floral hop aroma. Light sweet grain smell. No diacetyl. Can detect a hint of floral soap. No esters.  Flavor: Light sweetness gives way to floral hops. Lingering bitterness on tongue and roof of mouth well after swallowing.

The beer has a finger tall white head that reduces to an extremely thin layer covering the entire surface of the beer with some thick patches and an even thicker ring at the edges. Significant lacing is observed.  S: Lovely aromas of pale malts with some noble hops present - these give the smell some grassy and floral notes with just a hint of lemon zest as well.  T: Very much follows the smell, starts with the pale malts but then the hop flavors take over - grassy, floral, and just a hint of lemon peel. There is a nice pleasant light bitterness in the finish which lingers but is not overpowering.  M: Medium bodied with very heavy carbonation. Crisp.

Both in the nose and the taste. A pils doing what we all probably wish more of them would do - be refreshing and super drinkable but without being boring. Lovely hop presence - floral, lemony, grassy/herbal sitting atop a bed of crackers and bread dough. A spot of honey, perhaps. Longish bitter finish. The hops are definitely in charge here.  Light-bodied, fizzy and ridiculously easy to drink. Crisp, just a little creamy. This is pretty much as good as people will generally tell you it is. The embodiment of Summer.

It's just a delicious smell. I want to drink the smell of it by itself.  T - more of that floral note and some sweetness. I'm not getting much of that welcome grassy note you sometimes get in pilsners. There's a bitterness that at first blends very nicely with that floral note but in the end bites you in the soft palate and lingers in a not great way if you're me. There's also a faint sweetness that lingers, which is nice.  M - somewhat soft, yet with some carbonation tingle on the tip of the tongue.  O - This is a very well made pilsner targeted at people who appreciate hop bitterness. The other elements of the beer are lovely. I think this beer would be fantastic without so much bitterness at the end of the swallow - just a bit more balance. The bitterness does give it some identity, but I don't think it would blend in with every other pilsner if it lacked it; its floral nature and accompanying sweetness are bewitching all by themselves. I'd give it a 4.5 on taste if it weren't for the overbitterness. So instead it's a 4. I'd give it a 4.5 overall if not for the bitterness, so instead it's a 4.

Nice lacing left behind. Smell is a well-balanced mix of malt, hops, citrus (orange & lemon) and wheat. Taste is very similar with malt, hops, citrus, wheat and pepper. Very nice balance and amazingly complex for what is, to me, a very simple style of beer under most circumstances. Smooth, full-bodied for the style with a gentle, flowing effervescence that doesn't take away from the flavor, it enhances it.

345,1010,bogus564,4.12,"12 fl. oz., poured into a pint glass.  It’s been an interesting day, to say the least. Time for some relaxation, guitar playing, sports on TV, and a beer or two before hitting the rack and starting the whole crazy cycle over again.  A: It has a nice color to it – much more yellow than amber or gold. An aggressive pour produces a 2 cm head, the color of straw. The head is quite bubbly, and dissipates in less than a minute, leaving almost nothing on the sides. It’s more or less what you would expect from a beer of this type.  S: It’s not a powerful aroma – I would opt to call it subtle, or understated, or, perhaps, nonexistent (kidding). Subdued might be the correct descriptor. I’m reaching for it, but I’m picking up hops, grass, lemon – the usual suspects. There’s a very slight malty note behind it all, but you really have to be looking for it.  T: You are rewarded with a nice hoppy flavor; along with it, you’re going to pick up some pine, some grapefruit, some grass, and a tiny bit of malty sweetness. The proportions aren’t too shabby, and the flavors play well together. There’s also a wee bit of breadiness to it, certainly not disappointing, a nice discovery. It’s rather tasty indeed.  M: This beer has a nice mouthfeel if you’re into hoppy beers; lucky for me that I am. It’s light-bodied, fairly well-carbonated, plays nicely over the palate, and leaves a nice, dry hoppy finish. It’s a good solid choice.  O: If you’ve read this far, you won’t be surprised to find that I really enjoyed this beer. Good color, the aromas were enticing, and the taste was quite good, with well-balanced flavors. Mouthfeel was on point, and this is one that you can enjoy with a multitude of activities. It’s really good with fried chicken, by the way. Cheers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Very clean malt bill with a spicy hop finish. Good hop showcase with no real malt body . Bitter dry finish while still wetting the palette. Floral hops linger in the mouth.  Unfortunately though the beer just kind of drinks like a hopped up light beer. Light and fizzy with a big bitter finish. The lack of any sort of balance ruins the drinkability that a pilsner should have.

Tastes good as well- a lot of bitterness up front which mellows out a little into some pale malt sweetness, but stays bitter throughout. Maybe a little too much for the body.  Mouthfeel is interesting- not as quaffable as other pilseners, but certainly lively.

Smell is hoppy with floral tones dominating, hint of grapefruit as well. Taste is nice and hoppy and spicy with a nice assertive bready malt to back it up. Moputhfeel is smooth, medium-light bodied, and prickly due to the fairly high carb and spicy hops.  This is not a slave to its style and definitely shows some American tendencies.

Well balanced.  Taste: A very good blend of malts and hops. Upfront taste of bready biscuit pale malts with good hints of lemon. A fairly big hop presence for a pilsner. A good mix of grassy, herbal, and even some citrus hops. Some Noble and Saaz hops in the mix. A fairly robust and rich taste for the style.

Great, noble bitterness against an incredibly nice crackery backbone. Beautifully clean lemon zest and evergreen bitterness really kicks into gear in the end. Hop heavy for a pilsner, but without being unctuous or unbalanced. Long bittering dry finish.  M: beautiful carbonation helps keep the bitterness light and crisp.

Spicy, floral, grassy, this packs a lot of flavor from the hops, but not so much that it's overpowering. Very dry finish with the grainy and grassy flavors lingering.

Smell: Crisp and grassy aroma with some hints of spice and lemon peal. A faint malt was in the background.  Taste: The taste certainly was of a quality pilsner. First was some grassy citrus with a well pronounced lemon peal note in the middle. Finish was a quick hit of malts and then into a slightly bitter-sweet aftertaste of the grass and light citrus.

Nose is awesome grassy, fresh, snappy, bright hops.  Taste and feels: amazing. I think they should have an American Pilsener style created based off of this wonderful take on the central European classic. It's much more hop-forward with a crisp bitterness that almost steals the show, as compared to German or Czech styles. So fresh feeling. Lemon-like acidity and citrus combines terrifically with the crackery/grain/bread malt --malt is very delicate as compared to bready backbones in other styles. Drinkability is off the charts.

Taste - 4.0 Sweet, slightly powdery, bready Pilsener malt backbone, followed by herbal, slightly spicy hop flavour, a fair whallop of bitterness and finishes bone dry. The lean body really lets the hops punch above their weight in this assertively bitter beer. Alcohol becomes apparent with increased temperature.  Mouthfeel - 4.5 Light bodied and moderately carbonated, fine bead ensures a smooth, near creamy mouthfeel.  Overall - 4.5 An excellent example of a German Pilsener and a very enjoyable beer.

Light pilsener malt has just a hint of sweetness. Spicy, earthy hops and a bit of fresh cut grass add even more depth to the hoppy aroma.  Taste: This flavor impresses me at first and only gets better as I am able to analyze it more closely with each sip. The malt is quite dry, with just a hint of honey sweetness. A grassy bitterness starts to take hold. As the hops become more noticeable, a mostly earthy flavor comes through with a bit of spice on the tip of the tongue. The finish is firmly bitter with more grass and a bit of ammonia skunk.  Mouthfeel: At first I notice how grainy the front end is, along with how dry the mouthfeel is. The body feels a bit fuller than the average pilsener, but not by much. The carbonation is crisp but a little bit on the light side. There is a light residual hop oil after each sip.

S: Freshly poured beer smells of lemon rind, some sweet malt, and some herbal spiciness.  T: First thing I notice is citrus/lemon forward hops up front, and just barely a hint of sweet caramel, perhaps a bit of pine, some honey, and some general herbal spicy notes.  M: Not just a nice hop numbing, and the expected high carbonation that comes with the style, but an elegant creaminess that coats the tongue.

345,1010,matttttYCE,4.17,"A little late on posting this because it was reviewed with pen and paper and forgotten about. Thank you yet again Tom! Yet another brew I was ever so happy and excited to try!  Appearance - Poured into a regular pint glass, this beer has a nice 1 finger high foamy head that fades to a thin film after a little while, and a color of slightly hazy light straw. Lace is moderate.  Smell - Smell is very grainy, hay and wheat, light malt/caramel malt, sweet, a bit bready, with a nice presence of what I assume are noble hops. The hop aromas are present but not over the top and are very lemon citrus, floral, herbal, and maybe a bit of spice as well. Really enjoy this aroma.  Taste - Follows the smell pretty closely. Citrus, floral, herbal hops, and a bit of spice jump out from the start. Hoppier than most pilsners, but not overpowering. Just the right presence. Malt backbone is light but nicely done, with grainyness/hay and wheat, & caramel sweetness The hops are more center stage in this beer. And rightly so, they're done well, but not overdone. Gotta love a hoppier pilsner.  Mouthfeel - Mouth is really light, crisp, and refreshing. Consistency is crisp, carbonation is light, body is light, and finish is clean and smooth.  Overall - I would consider this among some of my preferred session beers. This is also pretty high up on my list of favorite pilsners. Very well done, Victory!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,WoodBrew,3.76,"Victory Pils available at the Boulevard in J'Town, PA. The beer's appearance is clear golden color with decent white head and carbonation which led to a good lace. The smell was typical of hay, barley and hint of hop. The flavor is dry strong presence of saaz hops. Mouthfeel is very good...there is enough flavor to keep the beer interesting and tasty. Great for sessioning. Overall it is a very good pilsner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BBP,4.28,"This beer pours a white gold color with slight, but withstanding head. The color was especially gorgeous during the pour, as it almost looked like it sparkled. Perhaps the effect of the first beer after a long night of work.  Slight amounts of hops and slight amounts of skunk were the first prevalent aromas I detected. Slightly grassy with a bit of bready malt.  The taste definitely surpasses near every pilsner I've ever had. It almost tastes like a hoppy pale ale, but it's classified otherwise. To give an idea of the hoppiness, it's somewhere between an EIPA and an AIPA. The taste is mildly zesty, and the hops are leaning slightly towards pine with some citrus. It has a good share of grassiness as well.  The body is a tad thin for the style, but carbonation covers it up pretty well. The finish has only the slightest dryness and overall the mouthfeel is quite unintrusive.  The drinkability of this is exceptional. Reviewing the one single I got was definitely tricky since it was disappearing before my eyes. It goes down like a very light beer, but packs the punch of something bigger. At 5.3%, it tastes like a 6%.  Highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,JDM02370,4.37,"This beer has a hoppy enough taste that one might confuse it with an india pale ale. Ignoring that aspect, the quality and flavor are top-notch and it is hard to think of a better variety that is on the market. The problem is that it appears to be one of several newer twists on the tradition of brews that originate in the Czech crown lands of Bohemia: it attempts to redefine pilsner by marrying it to something characterized by an abundance of hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Solid and mounting bitterness with a slight sweetness behind it.  Low-medium body with very high carb.  Definitely an enjoyable pilsener. If it was available at a similar price point to Noble Pils, I'd probably opt for it because of the bittering hops.

Lots of hops, hay, wheat, very bright. Hints of German lager yeasts with a little tinge of rust.  The taste is fresh and pleasant. Easily the hoppiest pilsener I've ever had, but it's a perfect blend between an American Ale and German Lager. A little bit of grapefruit, especially in the finish which is pleasantly bitter.  This is not a complex beer, but it is refreshing and wonderfully unique. I am admittedly not generally a huge fan of the pilsener, but this beer ranks among my favorite summer session beers.

Pretty hoppy, with candied grapefruit, tangerine and some mild grassy notes. Floral honey melds with the mild lagery grain character that I can never describe. Banana becomes increasingly prominent as it warms.  Taste starts very clean, before delivering a spicy, bitter blast of citrus pith and garden waste, which is tempered somewhat by a light caramel and boiled candy sweetness.  Light and benign, but with surprising length courtesy of the lingering Saaz bitterness.  Well constructed and with definite charisma.

Given that I have Odell’s, Great Divide, Breckenridge, and New Belgium to choose from, just to name a few, I will be hard pressed to sample all of their offerings in any reasonable time period, but it will be fun! So it was a 12 pack of three different Victory beers on a good sale that tempted me to go outside of Colorado. The Prima Pils pours with a clear sunshine yellow body and white even head. The head lasts, but does not lace. The aroma lets you know that some bitter is coming, and it does. While there is an underlying carpet of sweet malt, it is piled high with a dry bitter flavor, from start to finish. I did like this beer; it goes down well and has a balance to it. Better with food than for sipping alone.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BarryMFBurton,4.26,"Finally, a bottle of Prima Pils that didn’t expire six months ago! I was so happy that I found this on the shelves of my local bottle shop – I’ve heard a lot about it, but was never able to find it in its prime. Fortunately, this one still has a few weeks before it “goes bad.” Here’s to fresh beer!  A: Hazy, pale yellow body – seriously, I can’t even see through it. Chill haze or normal color, it doesn’t look very appetizing. The head is very nice, though – it’s white, foamy, and very sticky. Lots of lacing is what I like to see from a beer like this, and it’s exactly what I’m getting.  S: Oh wow, that’s much more German than I was expecting! I was anticipating a hopped-up American-style pils, but this has some glorious European scents. Banana esters are very big, with a mineral water scent beneath. It’s an aroma combination I almost though wasn’t possible from a US brewery. There’s a ton of fruity sugar, too, accompanied by a faint wheat husk hint and light, earthy hops. Excellent, excellent nose.  T: Starts out with a big kick of lemon tang and mineral water: sharp, earthy tastes. The hop profile is very enthusiastic for the style, coming in with a huge, bitter grassiness. German yeasts prop up the palate in a mostly doughy manner, as the taste moves towards the finish. Lemon zest and a dry wheat leave lingering effects on the tongue, which is surprising for such a low-ABV brew. This is one delicious beer.  M: Smooth, superbly drinkable. I could sip this all day, or gulp it down.  O: What a great pilsner! Now I know why it’s so esteemed by beer lovers. Victory has the right idea here – European flavor with a uniquely American element. This is my new favorite session beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Especially with the nice hop profile (which my beer style purist friends find horrifying).  Mouthfeel is light, crisp, dry.

Pours a clear, crisp light golden with a half finger of white foamy head, tons of carbonation bubbles rising to the top. Nose is wheat, European yeast, big on Nobel hops. Taste is carbon of the smell; big bitter flavours of the caramel malts and sharp distinct Nobel hops. Certainly an excellent tasting and exceptional pilsener. The bitterness lingers well into the finish in the mouthfeel which is well rounded and medium bodied. Overall, a top class craft beer for summer, even if it officially ends tomorrow.

Very refreshing, but very bold... could be more inviting.  T: Lemon flavors come out in force, sweet and sour alike, as well as earthy tone and a strong general drying bitterness. Malt is also not in short supply, being of the buttered biscuit variety from the nose. It's a very potent flavor experience, but I don't feel that it's blended all that artfully. Finish is dry and slightly sour.  M: High carbonation keeps the ample body from becoming too heavy. A fine grained texture.  O: Makes a statement, but kind of a crass one.

The flavor likewise features a combination of musty, earthy, and lemony hop characteristics, with a light biscuity malt presence adding some subtle sweetness. The fine, soft carbonation is pleasant and helps to make this one go down easily.  Overall, although this bottle was only about a week away from the end of its suggested 'best before"" date, it still provided a bright yet earthy flavor profile that was a bit unexpected but quite nice.

Mouthfeel is initially quenching and refreshing, but leads to an astringent finish as the hops and yeast meld on the palate.

Not over the top, just a beautiful accent that digresses from the style but really compliments it nicely.  Great medium bodied pils with wonderful carbonation and uber drinkability.  This is my go to beer for the near future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Merkur,3.67,"Beer poured into a pint glass.  Beer pours surprisingly cloudy. Rich yellow color, with a half finger of white foam that dissapates.  Beer smells slightly of citrus and hops.  Beer tasts slightly hoppy and of pine initially, with a nice crisp and clean finish.  Overall a very nice pilsner",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,beagle75,4.04,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tall goblet.  A: Clear, pale golden color with over one finger of white foam head. Light lacing remains on the glass.  S: Prominent zesty spice and dried grass is complemented by husky raw grain. Faint carbon dioxide and cardboard complicate the smell but take little enjoyment away.  T: Begins dry, with fair but bold pilsner malt and hop aromatics that evoke herbaceous flavors, centering on grassy but also include a floral touch. Moderate acidity helps to keep flavors bright into the middle where a thread of honey flavor emerges amidst prevailing dryness. Husky pilsner malt is re-asserted in the finish, where bitterness is substantial and tastes of green plant stems.  M: Medium viscosity, wet on the palate but also slightly acidic and astringent at times, with moderate carbonation.  D/O: This bold contribution sets the bar for American craft-brewed pilsner lagers. It leaves no doubt in the mind of the drinker regarding its all-malt pedigree, while also giving a clinic on Noble hop flavors and aromas. While authentic, the flavors struggle to match the smell in intensity. It would seem peerless, if not for the existence of Green Flash's Fizzy Yellow beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,WastingFreetime,4.42,"Transcribed from my notebook.  Pours out a clear pale yellow color, filled with bubbly carbonation and a large frothy head, some medium levels of lacing left behind with each sip. Body is light and fizzy as it ought to be, smells very strongly of herbal and tons of grassy hop family bouquet, I'm honestly kind of pleasantly surprised to find such an intense nose on a pilsener! The flavor contains a small burst of lemon and peppery spices on top of all the herbal grassy notes from the nose, and stays focused through the sip until the end, which is when the basic gentle spice bitter is left alone in the finish simply because the other components happen to all die back at the same timing! It's too well organized to have been anything but deliberately brewed that way...  This is a hell of a great pilsener, even though it pushes the style envelope for boldness and nose aggression, I love it all the more for it!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,BerkeleyBeerMan,4.42,"Nods to Beer Revolution in Oakland, CA for carrying the Victory line.  Appearance: The beer exudes a slightly hazy golden yellow color. The head pours a bubbly 1/4 inch though it dissipates quickly. A ring of foam remains on the side of the glass throughout drinking time.  Smell: Bright zesty floral smells. Slightly citric and a bit acidic. I note grass and hints of hay.  Taste: This beer is sweet and snappy. There are hints of wild yeast funk. Grass and hints of hay The taste is the same as the smell. It finishes slightly bitter. This is a pleasant drinking experience. Very refreshing and cooling.  Mouthfeel: Lightly carbonated. Good body for a Pilsner. This is a finely balanced beer.

345,1010,Chris585,4.05,"Purchased 8/23/11 from Bottle with Best Date of October '11. Could have been sitting for awhile, but I didnt notice much aging.  A - Cloudy Pils color with thin white head.  S - A bit metallic but floral and sweet aromas.  T - This is where it gets interesting...from the first sip I realized this was an exceptional tasting and well crafted Pilsener. With all the buzz about this beer, and that it has been around for some time, I am extremely pleased that I can once again drink a German Pils without worrying about the born on date, or drinking a stale skunk. Great job Victory, even though it has been around for awhile, for allowing me to explore the sessionable beer once again.  M - A little on the metallic side, but it subsides into a plethora of floral, piney, bitter, dry feel that I enjoy.  O - If you have ever been scared away from German Pilseners, or Pils in general seek this one out, you will be quite fond as I was.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BB1313,4.4,"Best before date printed on the label. 12oz bottle poured into a pilsener glass. Pours a hazy straw, not a typical pilsener color, but looks fine; not much head and lacing. Great aromas! At first it smells like your typical pils/lager, but with a short amount of time you'll be picking up on complex aromas. Smells like a flower bouquet. The aromas a very sweet; I'm also picking up some apple, pear, and maybe some white grape. All of that can be found in the flavors too, thankfully. I'm also picking up on some caramel malts, maybe even a touch of cocoa. This one finishes pretty bitter, the hops are noticeable but enjoyable. Mouthfeel is awesome, extremely smooth and has the perfect amount of carbonation; finishes dry.  Great beer, easily the best I've had from Victory. At my stage in the craft beer game, I should've tried this beer a long time ago. Shame on me for taking this long to try this beer. This is definitely in my top two favorite pilseners I've had to date, maybe the best. It doesn't really get much better for the style. This beer is an eye opener!

345,1010,output01x,4.17,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle (Enjoy By 12/06/11) into a pilsener glass.  A moderate pour yields a 1/2-finger cream white head that dissipates after a couple minutes to a thin dusting and thin foam ring. The body is a slightly cloudy pale golden straw color with a decent amount of slow-rising carbonation bubbles. Little lacing can be seen throughout consumption.  Light and sweet bready malts are complimented by fresh floral hops. The nose is not very strong nor complex, but well-balanced and enjoyable.  There is a lot more flavor here than the malts lead you to believe. Delicious malts start each sip like sweet and buttery bread. As soon as the beer is swallowed, an amazing and unexpected hops strike assaults your palate. Grapefruit and grassy hops overwhelm the malts, allowing a decent bitterness to accompany the hops flavors. As the bitterness subsides, a dryness sets in at the back of the mouth.  Light to medium bodied with decent carbonation, this beer is very drinkable. The body is easy-drinking and refreshing. The carbonation is not overly apparent but just enough to help this beer's drinkability. The dryness at the end of the taste beckons another sip.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

T: Light citrus with a strong bitterness at the end. Tasty. M: Thicker than I would expect from the look. Nice smoothness.  O: Here's the deal... this is a good to great beer for the style. I would come back to this day in and day out for a drinkable summer beer. It's very refreshing. However in the grand scheme of beers, this is more on the good level. Absolutely worth a try though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,afksports,4.11,"Thanks, Mom. I received a Victory 12 pack for my birthday. What a cool mom. Prima Pils is just the right beer to have to cool off on a summer day. She doesn't have the same beer-memory that I do, but this was also the beer she and I shared at a dinner celebrating my Dad's birthday. So even though pilseners are not my style of choice, Prima has a lot going for it.  But the beer can stand on its own. It's got a golden body, tons of fluffy white head and lace that stick around the glass, tiny bubbles shooting up from the bottom, and a wonderful aroma of actual hops. It smells wet, like a field of hops wet with dew. (I haven't even been there, but ... artistic license...). There's grass, and some bitterness there too. Not much to the malt presence, but that's appropriate.  The taste is drying, bitter at the start, crisp and light, features grapefruit and grass. As I drink it, I tend to want water, and that's a drawback. It's definitely drying.  Still, it's a nice light to medium bodied beer that's one of the tops of its style, it's got great carbonation, and it came from my mom.

I get fresh malts and a little hops around the edges. What a lager should smell like.

This pilsner boasts lovely light Grape Nuts cereal flavors in the malt, and a neat layer of light grapefruit hops that lingers on the tongue in a dry finish. Sugars are well-balanced, and emphasize the grain flavors, rather than mask them.

The nose is nice, revealing dry grainy notes, some herbal-grassy hop and a tinge of mineral.

Carbonation bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.  S: Tempting. I can smell this one while it sits on the table a foot from my face...and its tantalizing. Sweet Grain smell with very noticeable hop aroma (noble hops?).  T: The taste is light and refreshing. There is a biscuit-like sweetness that also tastes of lemon and grapefruit (from the hops no doubt.) The hops also leave a lasting bitterness that is light yet very tasty and appreciable.  M: The mouthfeel is medium bodied yet refreshing feeling. Everything here seems good.  O: I love this beer and drink it often. I think it is one of Victory's best beers and a great summer beer.

Slightly bready malt note, but definitely overwhelmed by spicy and herbal hop aromas.  Taste. Right up front there is a beautiful herbal, kind of medicinal, hop flavor complemented well by a light bready malt. Bitterness then takes over, weak at first but building until it reaches the level seen in some IPAs. Hop flavor is not completely taken over by bitterness, though. Rather it is complemented by a nice earthy, grassy hop and a pleasant malt sweetness. The finish is dry with a lingering, slightly sweet, bitterness.  Mouthfeel. Thin body, not surprising for a pilsner. Not as much carbonation as I expected, possibly due to the fact that it was served out of a growler.

The beer also laces well.  The beer smelled fresh, like spring almost. It had very floral notes on the front end, the hops come through like a beer potpourri. There was also a light malt scent, masked by the hops.  This beer tasted like a classic pilsner should. The hop flavor was dominating, very zesty, herbal, and posessed a fine bitter tinge. The bitterness lingers on your tongue for around 30 seconds after each drink. Just like in the aroma, there is a smooth malt taste that hides behind the powerful hops, adding to the drinkability.

This is like a classic German Pilsner aroma, but beefed up a bit. Clean floral hoppiness on the palate with a decent malt backbone.

Fruity and perfumey and yet with potent citrus (lemon) and herbal hops. One of the best smelling beers I am have come across.  T - Herbal hop oil right off the bat. The hops presence is bold for the style but it works--and then some. Hops bitterness plays with the citrus zest and they fade into a lasting spicy (and very dry) finish. The near white wine sweetness has a harder time remain present in the flavor as opposed to the aroma but it is still there. Smooth and refreshing wheaty malt sweetness lingers throughout, giving this hop heavy take of the style proper balance.  M - Medium. Lush for the style (as it the taste.)

S: Nice firm noble hop aroma – grassy, floral, herbal, and softly spicey. Doughy malts in the background with just a touch of grainy sweetness.  T: Rather hoppy and bitter for a Pils. Opens grassy and herbal with a fair bit of spice and quite a bite. There is briefly a splash of mildly sweet doughy malts. In the middle hops transition to spicey, earthy, and strongly bitter. A clean, scraping, cleansing bitter. Only well into the finish do some resin and hop oils come out. There is also a hint of lemon throughout and a slight astringency poking though.  M: Enough body to let you know there are some malts here. Despite the slightly narrow and thin taste this appears to be a frogs hair over medium body with CO2 pretty well matched. Start semi-dry and goes to quite dry. A bit palate cleansing. A touch astringent and even puckering.  D: More like, “A bold pilsener beer.” Very firmly bitter & hoppy. Almost unbalanced.

The head is 1/2 inches of rocky snow and lace clings in spots in a wave pattern. The smell is musty and mineral from the yeast with a pils malt scent and the German origin is apparent in both hops and yeast with slight grassy vegetal and herbal aromas from the hops. The malt and hops with the yeast delivers a mild sweet scent which compliments the earthy elements well. I get a bit of grass, probably because it is so fresh, but mild grainy feel with high carbonation and spicy, peppery middle and mild sweet tinges throughout. The light grainy texture in there with a pretty resinous hop texture and highly dry semi-bitter finish.  The tast is light toasted pils malt with a mild floral hop flavor and some spicy grassy tastes that aren't harsh, yet still gives the impression that this pils is highly hop flavored with a very mild yeast mineral quality and light pilsner malt sweetness. The finish is dry and spicy with a nice yeasty tinge. I think this is a great American take on the German Pils style, with a pretty hop forward taste, yet it is still within range to be considered traditional influenced with nice noble hop character and high drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,VncentLIFE,4.75,"One inch head that sticks around. Bright golden color that I expect from a German Pilsener.  The smell is the best Pilsener I've smelled in my days. Floral and Piney hops come through straight away, and are intertwined with the malt backbone.  Taste wise, I got a bit of a light smokey flavor out of my nose. The hops are a little more subdued than I expected, but the overall taste was really good. Best Pils I've had.

The taste, wow, I'm used to pilsners being real light, almost water like with some hop bite, but this is a full on hoppy pils, sort of like I remember SA Noble Pils being fresh, this is very good stuff. I get a tone of noble hops up front, a lemony, citrus taste, then on the way down some grassy, biscuity, sweet malts quickly followed by a load of bitter hops.

I love the stylised hop cone on the label.  Poured into a Sam Smith's pint glass. A hazy pale straw colour with medium carbonation and fine visible sediment. Yields a large head of white foam that lasts for a couple of minutes before subsiding to a surface layer. The aroma is fantastic; a huge hit of lemony citrus and grass with undertones of pale malt and yeast.  Tastes of bitter noble hops with plenty of citrus. A dry lemon flavour dominates, accompanied by a mild herbal quality. Underpinned by light grainy malt and subtle notes of yeast. Mouthfeel is smooth, with good body for the style and crisp carbonation. An astringent, bitter finish with an aftertaste to match.  Excellent; the best pilsner I've tried. The hoppy citrus flavour is great - distinctive but light. If only I could drink this every day! Too bad it's a bit pricy over here for regular consumption.

The sweet tastes are tart, pineapple might be the best thing I can come up with.  Mouth is as a Pilsner should be. Bright, light and refreshing.  Overall I didn't hate or love this one.

Beer is an attractive sunflower gold with very active carbonation streaming from the bottom.  Aroma: standard German Lager smell of sour and grassiness.  Mouthfeel: for all the carbonation the mouthfeel is a little flat and lifeless.  Taste: hard for me to get past the astringent herb bitterness followed by a soapy aftertaste. Beer improved slightly as it warmed but it really seems like this a beer that is over-hopped, but not with Cascade or Centennial but rather with German Noble Hops. The bitterness overwhelms my taste buds completely.  Notes: I've had 5 bottles of this and has not grown on me. Stoudt's Pils seems immediately more enjoyable.

Very drinkable, hoppier than an average pils, good carbonation levels, very quenching. However, I have to question whether it's true to the style. Perhaps not all that traditional. And more than that, I have to question whether I really love pils in general. After all the incredible APAs and IPAs and German wheat beers I've been drinking lately, the pils taste just put me in the mind of the old BMC crap.

But after reading about this, and hearing it compared to Miller Lite it might change my thoughts on it. Oh, probably not. It smells good, it tastes good, and has SO much flavor to it.  The beer smells incredible, and has a wet, yet dry nose to it. Beers like this make me think of walking the streets in Europe. The beer in Europe is better, but perhaps it’s because it’s Europe. Now, what’s this beer taste like?  The beer starts smooth on the front of the palate, and slides down the back of the throat smooth, and crisp. Then, after all that a VERY dry aftertaste hits you. Going back to this, comparing it to Miller Lite, it’s not even in the same category. The bad thing about this beer is I could chug it! I just can’t get over that aftertaste and how dry it stays.  The beer doesn’t have a very big ABV, but that’s okay. It doesn’t need one. The beer is just so good. Plus, the aftertaste sticks around forever. I just love this beer.

I loved how the carbonation really cleansed my palate and finished dry from all the hops present. Wow, really nice.  O- Probably the best pilsner I have had.

345,1010,leschkie,3.11,"Normally, when I write these beer reviews, I like to try to create a picture for the reader so he/she knows exactly what I'm visualizing and knows exactly those thoughts that are going through my head. Regrettably, however, I just don't think this beer is worth the time to do that. So, instead, my review will be succinct and exactly to the point.  Tasting notes from 6/16/11. On tap at Stone and poured into pilsner glass.  Appearance: Pale gold with some turbidity consistent with partial filtering. Turbidity gives the beer an added and attractive peach-like element. Traditional white-colored head that poured about 3/4 inch thick to start but eventually receded to half it's original thickness; head remained full and intact across the entire surface of the beer throughout the tasting.  Smell: Short-lived scents of lemon, floral, and grass that eventually gave way to one of stagnant well-water. Reminded me of the kind of scent one experiences when touring an unsanitary working microbrew. I ended up having to close off my nostrils for a majority of my sips.  Taste: Luckily, the sudden transformation was not immediate, so I was able to enjoy (albeit for a short while) the delightful flavors of lemon, earthly grass tones similar to oleocanthal in an extra virgin olive oil, hops, and orange peel with first few sips. Then the beer began to taste exactly like that stagnant water smell described earlier, and, to put it delicately, that's all I'm going to say about that.  Mouthfeel: Light-bodied and a little more carbonation than I would have liked though. Never did like the taste of well-water rolling around in my mouth while growing up.  Overall: This one will probably come out to about a 3.2, and I'm actually being quite generous here. I'm sure by now you know what I thought of the beer overall, so I need not say more. Pity because I actually enjoy this style quite well. However, I am going to give this beer the benefit of the doubt and will promise to revisit it...just as soon as I finish off my mouthwash and give the scars left behind some time to heal.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

That being said, I try to approach this with an objective mind and rate it based on it's quality and not just based off my own taste preferences.  It poured a hazy straw colour, with a white head that dissipated pretty quickly, leaving very limited lacing (alliteration!)  The smell is light and hoppy, with a citrusy backbone that finishes almost a little sweet/floral.  Drinking it follows the same theme from the nose, with the hops leading the way with a light spicy/citrusy undercurrent. The flavour is primarily in the first swish through the mouth, though the second act gives way to the faint floral notes from the nose, while the finishing aftertaste is the hoppy bitterness that sits with you for a little while.  It's a lightly carbonated beer, which goes down pretty smoothe, but nothing particularly notable.  Overall, it's a beer that I can enjoy drinking if it happens to be around the house, but I would not seek it out.

A nice combination of citrusy flavor and hop bitterness to go along with a fuller than normal body and a crisp, dry finish.

Malty flavour, the hops add some grassy, slightly earthy flavour to it and give it some depth.  Perfect body for the size, finishes with some nice, balanced but ever-present, bitterness.  Overall a complex pilsner, well executed, drinkable as well. Wouldn't mind this as a go-to lager.

Not to be mistaken with the likes of a BMC lager, as this has a much cloudier and thicker appearance despite being such a light beer. Smell is of faint grassy hops, pretty muted for the most part. However, after checking the date on the bottle, this is a good bit past its prime. My fault for not checking the bottle. Oops. It holds up surprisingly well, the pleasant grassy hops are still there, just much more muted. I've had this fresh and it is a delight to drink on a hot day. Very refreshing. Just wish it was easier to find fresh around here. Victory bottles always seem to be a good bit past their prime. However, it's still very drinkable and I'm enjoying it.

Color is a very, very pale yellow to gold.  After the relatively light aroma and color, the taste is surprising. Definitely a nice floral hop bite, but well-balanced - although this is a full-flavored beer, it is still a pilsner, and as such is a crisp, clean drink. Taste finishes pretty clean, with some leftover maltiness and hop bittnerness that stays.  Mouthfeel is light and a little bit creamy. Pretty highly carbonated.

345,1010,Hayward,4.08,"Excited to try this one out as I've recently been getting into Pils style beers again.  Pouring it out, it looks great, as a pils should, a pale golden crystal clear.  Smell gives off a little more floral/citrus hops oils than would be found in a traditional Pils.  Taste shows off more of the American style of hopping (dry hopping maybe?), with citrus and light grapefruit notes coming to the palette firstly. The after taste is a bittery/spicy hops.  Good carbonation, glides down the tongue in a nice way, a very drinkable beer.  Overall I thought this was a great tasting beer, but in general it is more of an American foral hops style Pils and should maybe be in a different category than that of a Czech or German style pils, which would have more of a crisp grassy and spicy hop body.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

The taste starts sweeter and bready, almost like a biscuit, but quickly moves towards a nice spicy flavor. Good black pepper flavors as well as earthy tastes.  The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with nice stings from the carbonation. The spiciness also adds a good tingle to the tongue with each sip. Overall, this is a great beer.

The head is thick and white, leaving ringlets of lacing around the perimeter of the pilsner glass.  The aroma is of lager malt, a slight funk (positive), floral notes / floral hops.  The flavor is quite tasty and refreshing. This is one of the better examples of a German Pilsener I have had, especially from an American brewery. The flavor leads with a malty, biscuity character, then gracefully transitions to a light hop bitterness in the finish. Personally, I would prefer the hop character to be slightly less pronounced, allowing the malt component to shine through a bit more, but I can't deny that this is done artfully.

Transitions directly into this very interesting and very pleasant floral flavor that seemed to wash away the bitter notes that hit the palate upon first tasting. Finishes clean.  Mouthfeel: Very light and somewhat thin, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  Overall: Quite good overall, and the flavor is well balanced.

345,1010,Kegatron,4.1,"On tap @ the Victory Brewing Company (Downingtown, PA) on 4/23/11. Served in a Pils glass.  Pours a clear copper, with a rich looking bright-white head. This retains with a thin frothiness that skims the surface, leaving back sticky swathes of foamy looking lacing. The aroma smells fresh, floral, herbal, citric, and a bit spicy, with a light underlying bready sweetness from the malts.  The taste has a leafy and spicy bitterness to it that stretches the whole way through. This just has a bright hoppy pop to it in the mouth that is supported by those Pils malts, which while giving off some balancing sweetness here, mostly have a grainy stiffness to them. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a crisp, clean, and all-around assertive feel in the mouth.  Ah, this is a classic from Victory and I never turn down a pint or bottle if it comes my way. That mix of German and Czech hops lends this a distinct kind of herbal or earthy spiciness that I really dig and that close to 5% ABV keeps this right there at that approachable level where you can have a couple of these without taxing the palate a whole lot.

345,1010,jampics2,4.47,"On tap at the Winking Lizard. Served in a pint glass for around $4-$4.50.  The beer looks alright, but there's not enough head to gain any better score. Sure, that could be due to the bartender's pour, but I'm guessing the head retention on this is just a bit short of greatness with or without Johnny Badpour. The brilliant gold color has just a hint of cloudiness, and the white ring of foam leaves its mark on the side of the glass.  This is classic American Pils here. The nose is all grain and flowers. The malt is pale with hints of crackers and just enough graininess. The hops add earthy and flowery notes, giving depth and character. Just a touch of tropical (pineapple) and citrus (lemon) round things out.  The taste is exceptional. This is easily one of the best American Pilseners in the world. The experience starts with sweet malt with some Plisen graininess and just a touch of toast. A bit of honey sweetness launches things into the hoppy portion of the tasting curve. There's a touch of lemon from the hops, then floral and earthy notes that provide great depth and compliment the malt perfectly.  The mouthfeel is crisp and medium-bodied. Probably more body than your typical American micro pils. This doesn't seem out of place, as the flavor backs things up. The flavor ends in flowery hops and sweet malt with no hints of booze.

Bready malt aroma in the background.  Tasty blend of flavors featuring the aforementioned hops. The hop flavor comes across a little more piney and bitter in the flavor than the aroma might suggest.

I get grassy hop characteristics but not too much, and It smells like it would taste a bit dry. Some muted grain underneath, very simple.

It finishes with floral and dry hop flavors that linger on the tongue. Bitterness is low and lingers a bit as well.  M - Moderate-high crispness and lite-medium bodied.  O - I can definitely see why there's so many people that like this brew, and it's sparked my interest for the Pilsner style. To me this beer is easy enough to toss back a few or more over some BBQ or anything really, very drinkable.

Light bready notes of malt, slightly toasted, grassy hops, lager yeast goodness on the nose. So far so good.  Woh, floral hops dominate on the taste. lemon rind follows. bitterness takes over towards the end. Melts away into bready malts.  Mouthfeel is light with hefty carbonation.  Knockout pilsner. The only downside is it might get a little too floral/citric/bitter after a few of these, IMHO.

Big grassy, earthy hops greet the palate and come off cleanly, dry, and bitter. Wow, has a nice big green apple snap to it, something you only get from a fresh, hoppy pilsner. Jeez, you know I wonder how different the WORLD would be if people learned how to appreciate what a real pilsner style beer tastes like. Peace in the Mid-East? Maybe. Racial harmony? Possibly.

Bitter finishes with citrus lemon and orange peel. M: Crisp dry bitter finish. O: Overall this has opened my eyes to the fact that a bright yellow beer can be full of flavor.

The color is a pale yellow and slightly hazy.  S: The most prominent smells are grass and pine. This is somewhat balanced by the scent of malt. As it warms, the yeasty smell of alcohol becomes more noticeable.  T: The taste is clean, crisp and refreshing. It is herbal and almost flowery with traces of citrus. The hops are minimal but very clean and balanced by the malt. There is a bitterness to this beer that lingers long after you have swallowed.  M: Light and refreshing.

345,1010,chicagoabbot,4.02,"On-tap at Old Town Social Club here in Chicago. In fairness to the appearance, it was a pretty sloppy pour on the part of the bartender, he was looking away until the glass spilled over onto his hand. Not sure if he was trying to look cool or what.  I like the body of this beer, very clean and clear, very neat. What a pilsener should be. It has a good lager funk in the nose, with some small depth to the malt and a very clean and small but super clean hop aroma.  It exemplifies the qualities of a pilsener on the tongue. This is so different from an American adjunct pils, it's not even funny. Rich and crisp on the tongue, Prima Pils is a joy. Excellent mouthfeel. I recommend trying this pils, it is one of the best around.  As far as value, it's a little light. For example, this runs me $8.99 a 6er vs Radeberger at $5.99 a 6er and Noble Pils or Urquell comes in at $12.49 a 6er, which are all also excellent examples of the style (and corn free!)

Smell: Yeasty malt smelled combined with piney hops but the balance seems to favor the malts more than the hops but just barely.  Taste: A combination of piney and citrus hops with the balance in favor of the pine hops rather than the citrus. Malts balance out the hops enough to take some edge off of the hops  Mouthfeel: Dry. None to little carbonation.  Overall: I'm not fan of hopped up beers (Heresy!!!) but this is definitely an exception.

Also smells watery, hopefully that won't be what it tastes like.  T--Watery hops is the first thing I taste. I didn't expect this much hop flavor in a pilsner. It was a nice surprise. The aftertaste is grassy and piney. Really bitter flavor that I wasn't expecting.  M--The feel is light, crisp, and carbonated. It certainly has a water feel to it, but that doesn't hinder the enjoyability of this brew.  O--This is a very good pilsner. Actually, probably the best one I have ever had.

Smells a little like watered down hops if possible, or maybe I'm just reminded of other pilsners I've had by the smell. Hops are the most prevelant item in the smell.  Tastes like a hoppy pilsner. Which, may I say is nice to have. I was hesitent to even buy this beer because it was a pilsner and my experience with pilsners has been mostly BMC kind of beers, none of which I've enjoyed too much. With this beer the hops hit you right away, followed by that crisp, refreshing spring taste of grass. Great beer that's on the lighter side to have on a hot day and still get a nice dose of not-overbearing hops.  Mouthfeel is crisp on the front and a little creamy in the finish, creating a nice balance of both. Overall a good beer. Freshness date on this bottle is almost a month ago however and I wonder how that affects the overall taste. I understand that good pilsners are complicated beers that have a limited time to be enjoyed at their full potential, so I wonder how much this one is affected.

Three full fingers of head are quick to disappear into a sea of golden straw yellow. This was one of the most beautiful pours I've ever gotten. Once settled, it is a slightly shrouded but mostly transparent yellow. Reminiscent of cider.  Smell - Smells heavily of wheat and natural earth tones. Slightly hoppy, crisp and inviting to the nose. Some light yeast and spice as well.  Taste - Slightly bitter on the tongue at first; but otherwise rich in spice and citrus. Not nearly as malty or hoppy as expected. Come to think of it, this beer tastes like Lucky Charms. Slightly bready with a soft sweetness.  Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Extremely light bodied and refreshing. Quite a crisp and dry finish.

345,1010,ScottUCF84,4.32,"Picked up a single from Total Wine here in Orlando. They don't have too many rarities, but with that vast of a selection I have yet to try them all. Prima has been on my list for a while and I figured it was time.  Anyway, I didn't think before grabbing the bottle... but the freshness date was labeled: ""Enjoy By Feb 7, 2011"". Damn. Oh well, time to give this a shot. The Prima poured a surprisingly cloudy gold; it could have passed off as a wit-bier, suspended particles and all. The white head contrasted beautifully; picture the cream on the top of a lemon meringue pie, in beer form. Unfortunately it dissipated quickly and there wasn't much lacing to keep me company. Still a great looking beer.  I don't have the most trained nose, but I immediately detect note of citrus peel, spices, pine, and grass. Definitely not like any pilsener I have smelled, once again I pick up characteristics of a Belgian white (an authentic one, not Shock Top).  As I sip the beer I finally get hit in the face by what I think is a well crafted pilsener! I'm not really going in order here, but what really stands out is the bite and lingering bitterness from the ""whole flower European hops"" that Victory used in this one. The wit-bier characteristics I was speaking of are nowhere to be found here. I quickly learned that these attributes were due to the hops, as their acidic nature nibbles sporadically throughout the experience. The sweet malty flavor of this style is definitely there, but simply not as long as others I've tried. The hops quickly take over in this fine example. Hops don't always mean instant win in my book, but here they give the pilsener a balance never before seen...err tasted.  Prima takes it easy on the tongue with moderate carbonation for a pilsener. The hops give the tongue a good beating but it's nowhere near overwhelming.  All in all, I'm upset I didn't grab a sixer (with a later freshness date to boot), as I'd like to see how sessionable this brew is. Either way great pilsener, probably the best and most unique I've had! Lived up to the hype!!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Wow, this is by far the best pilsner I've had and a clear winner above them all. Starts with cracker like malt, nice and sweet. This transitions sharply into the hop notes, which are prominent.

T: Spicy bitter hops with some lemon and cereal flavors. A nice dry grapefruit juice flavor at the finish. There are many particular flavors in Victory's lagers which I can not put my finger on. However, I could pick one out blind anyday. Unbelievably refreshing and complex.  M: A nice light body with rather strong carbonation which I prefer for this style.

The bubbles in my mouth make it an exciting but not a session beer. Good pilsner!!!  D- Not high, but a good beer non the less! Victory never disappoints craft brew heads. Always fresh hops and some citrus. I enjoyed but wouldn't drink more than one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Aroma is of earthy and spicy noble hops, but there is something odd going on. kinda musty and smells like spring yardwork, kinda odd im getting that in here, but the bottle is well within freshness dates.

Moderate body and enjoyable all around, will probally only buy this in the summer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,veinless,4.15,"Pours a clear, rich gold, with not much lacing, but lots of good foamy white head and lots of tiny bubbles that stick to the side of the glass.  Nose is very refreshing and clean, with lots of floral aromas and lemon zest. Malt is bready and light, but nicely weighted.  Taste follows with great balance, as it starts bitter, has plenty of lemon citrus, and a bit of leafy hops, but the biscuity malt comes in well to keep it smooth the whole way through.  Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and refreshing as it should be for the style, but the citrus in particular aids the mouthfeel quite a bit. Drinkability is fantastic, although the malt gets a bit strong near the end, it is really well balanced for the most part.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

S - Very wonderful light bread aroma, wheat/grain is subtle and the zesty spiciness of the noble hops shines through very well.  T - Don't drink a lot of pilseners but this one has a great combo of hops/grains. The hop flavor isn't overbearing at all and it has just the right amount of alpha acids and peppery zest to compliment the light and sweet malts.  M/D - Medium-light body with lots of carbonation that can be felt on the palate. Finishes with a neutral amount of dryness, not too dry not too sweet. Not the most complex style on the planet but this one is easy to drink especially now that the weather is starting to warm up.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Light aromas of grain mixed in with a good light floral bouquet and hints of pineapple. Some light banana way down in the back.  Crisp, and refreshing. A light wheat like grain base was cut by a nice orange rind like hop flavor that was quick to turn nice and bitter on you. Hints of banana flavored yeast and a nice finish that was full of fresh cut grass and a wet hay flavor. This was a nice medium bodied pilsner. Much thicker then you would normally see from the style, but it worked very well. An outstanding session ale, this was one I would have no issues in repeating any day. It was light, crisp and clean with a nice profile and low ABV, all things making this lean hard towards being very seasonable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Would like more retention, but nice look for the style.  The aroma is a nice balance of deep toasted malt, and earthy, grassy notes with a touch of lemony citrus. The taste follows the nose. Fresh hay, grass, earthy elements and a touch of lemon. Underneath is a nice light toasted malt. Slightly on the bitter side, but the flavor is awesome for the style. Nothing was overdone.

Aroma of a good lager and sort of grassy hayness with a slight bit of noble hops.  Taste is great. A crisp pils with a good flavor. Although I like the hops and malt in Noble Pils better. This one is solid as well.  Mouthfeel is nice and crisp and dry. Nice high carb.  Overall a very solid pils.

Hops come through strong near the end, and the finish has a touch of bitterness. The aftertaste is leafy, earthy and dry. M: Medium bodied, ample carbonation and a dry mouthfeel make this go down easy. D: The quantity of hops in this are unlike any other pilsner I've had.

Minorly hoppy, certainly a strong scenet of pilsner (herbal).  The tongue is where this beer lost me. Got almost a moldy flavor with the beer. I'll admit I'm not a huge German been fan, but this brew really didn't do much for me.  And yes, I know I'm in the miority on this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Lots of good stuff to taste here, but in my mind it's too bitter. If they'd ease back on the bittering hop additions, this would be one for the ages. Still, the most flavorful American lager in recent memory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

It had a nice sudsy lacing that remained as the brew was consumed.  This brew has a great aroma. Its a nice a grassy, lemony aroma. Hoping that this is a prelude to the taste of this brew. There is a bit of a yeasty/bready aroma as well. This is not the smell of a normal pilsener, so I am very interested on how this will turn out.  This brew has tons of hop flavor at the front, giving it a great backbone to this brew, with a bit of a light malt taste. It has nice grassy/lemony bitter aftertaste which is great. This is a great flavor that I haven't really ever expected from a pilsener.  The mouthful on this brew is very light bodied, with a very nice carbonation. Its nice and dry and super crisp.  Overall this is one of the best examples of the style I have ever had. Its was super refreshing, with a great flavor. I could surely sit and enough a sixer of this without a problem. This could be a great session brew for myself. I would have to say the heavy handed hops in this brew, some people might say its to much.

S: Grassy hops, yeast, and green apple.  T: Doesn't have the the super grainy pilsener taste that I am used to. The hops are very assertive in this beer and define the taste. More bitter than your average Pils. A grassy and grapefruit hop flavor combination. I think the taste fits the style more than most highly hopped pilsners. The flavor isn't 100% there though and the beer drinks a tad too watery.  M: Light and borderline watery. Dry finish.  D: Good but not great. I'd probably forget about it if it weren't made by Victory.  Overall I am a huge fan of Victory, but this one fell a bit short. The hops and color are good, but everything else is lacking.

Pours a completely clear, golden yellow color with a minimal, thin off-white head that is gone as quick as it shows up. Tiny wisps of lacing cling to the glass.  Smells of yeast, spice and hops. Yeast is first and seems to ride along underneath some spicy aromas in the middle and some bitter hops at the end.  Taste is clean, pale malt up front with equal hint of sweetness and spiciness. A sharp dose of bitter hops come through at the end and cleans out the other flavors leaving a lingering, sticky bitterness at the finish.  Crisp and clean. Light bodied with ample carbonation. Very light mouthfeel without feeling thin at all. Great dose of hops gives it a good bite and feels lively on the tongue.  Excellent drinkability. Crisp and clean. Light and flavorful.

Just right body with a lime hop tangyness in taste. Mid palate lemon but this big citrus lemon/lime and hop play on taste and finish making the beer almost like an Italian cafe soda. Crisp and tangy.

345,1010,StoutHunter,3.86,"I bought a single bottle of this today at the lager mill for $1.59. I have heard good things about this beer but have I have never seen it around till now. Best buy date of December 19 2010, hope this one held up. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a pilsener glass.  A- This beer has some a nice label, I like the simple hop cone against an emerald green background. This beer poured a nice pale golden color with two fingers worth of fluffy white head that died down to a thick ring that stayed the rest of the time and left lots of nice lacing.  S- The first thing that hits me in the aroma is large amounts of yeastyness and bread crust. I also get a mix of grassy and citrus hops at the end. The aroma of this beer is pretty different from your average pilsener.  T- Pale malts show up first which makes for a nice back bone for this beer. Then the hops show up sharply imparting a grassy bitter after taste. I can tell the hops have died down a bit but I can still tell that this is a very hop forward pilsener.  M- Light bodied, great carbonation, dry, and very crisp.  D- This is a pretty drinkable brew that goes down smooth and is quite crisp and refreshing. I could definitely take out a couple of these in a sitting but the abundance of hops in this brew may be too much after a while.  Overall I though that this was one good plilsener. I enjoyed the fact that this one had a little more hops then your normal pilsener which helped make this beer pretty unique for its style.

Not really the kind of color I like to see in a beer, but spot on for the style.  S - Yeasty and dry, almost a bit Belgian in character. There is a slight slight touch of bitter hop hidden in the back. Also present is a sweet citrus (orange or tangerine?), but only a bit. Almost smells like a Belgian wheat beer crossed with a Pils. Unique.  T - Sharp initial sip. Very crisp pine and floral hop flavor. Malty and perhaps a bit of toasted bread. I really really dislike the (earthy? certainly very bitter, but in a bad way) aftertaste, which is a shame since I like the rest of the profile.  M - Light body with some nice carbonation. A bit dry, which I like.  D - It takes a lot of getting used to for me. I enjoyed it half the time, and half the time I felt like I had to force it down.

Smell: Very floral with some orange and cut grass thrown in. Quite fragrant for a pilsner.  Taste: Quick tea+honey like sweetness up front, then moves into a sharp bitter finish. The bitterness becomes more pine-hop like as an aftertaste. Very hoppy for a pilsener.  Mouthfeel: Good crisp carbonation on the tongue, with the beer going down easily after that. Some lingering sensation on the teeth.  Drinkability: It's good, but I would need to pair another one of these with the right meal to enjoy another.

Smell is quite intriguing; something quite sharp in there is balanced by yeasty dryness of highly attenuated beer; most memorabl to me is the slight stinging effect of the vapors in deep snorts. Alcohol? Pungent hops? I'm not sure, but it is a good thing, and very unique in my limited experience with pilseners.  Taste is altogether pleasurable, but the sharpness of the taste is new to me. Again, new seems good here, but the dryness is intense. Tannic effect on my tongue.  Mouthfeel is notably distinct by dryness and tannic feeling that seems as much a flavor of taste as it does a sensation of texture. Dry, sharp, slight tannin, quick, intense burst of flavor and texture. Maybe everything that a Pils should be, but I'm not an expert.  A good experience.

Folks rave about Prima Pils on BA, but I read through my evaluation here and nothing has changed. I'm going to name this one my ""Blair Witch Beer"", because that movie just didn't scare me like it apparently did everyone else.  Poured into my only pilsner glass, of course. Nice clear pils with a white, thick (yet temporary) head--could have read this typing through it.  The smell doesn't tell me much about how this beer will taste, which I don't expect too much from pils. It does seem very fresh and grassy, though, reminding me of garden vegetables--cucumbers, kale.  The first thing I taste is pine, which I am very leery of in beers other than IPAs--this tends to mask the alcohol taste, which shouldn't be necessary in a 5% ABV. I think low ABV pils should be a showroom display case for hops--I want to be able to really taste and try to identify the hops, but I can't (hey, there's a picture of a hop on the label). There is a floral taste at the finish of a drink that is kind of nice, but is quickly snuffed out by that pine-alcohol thing.  It's not bad and I could probably drink another, but I'm surprised that it is at the top of the list for this style.

T - Pilsner malts are still the base in the taste, but theres another note coming through that I would imagine the yeast bring into the mix. Fairly complex for a simple beer. Floral hops are the initial taste but don't come forward to take over the beer.  M - Thin bodied, good amount of carbonation though it wasn't visible initially. Finish is slightly dry with some lingering sweetness. Finish is my favorite part of this beer. It doesn't stay around too long and it adds a nice complexity to the beer.  D - Overall, love the beer. Great sessionable beer with the ABV and body. While it's complex, it isn't complex enough to keep me coming back for another.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

This is a drinkable and enjoyable beer but I don't ubderstand why it scores as highly as it does.

345,1010,jbphoto88,3.65,Golden lemon in color with gobs of thick bubbles feeding a white spongy head. The beer is mostly clear but does have a slight foggy appearance.  The nose is simple but very complete and well done. Fresh malts with lemon and floral hops. Very nice and a perfect example of the style.  Taste is like the nose but slips down the scale a bit because of an overall mustiness that I believe to be from the hops. They taste almost powdery and it's hard to get over. The good news is that the malts and the lemony floral flavors do materialize and make it enjoyable. Its just not as clean as I would like.  Mouthfeel like the taste is just above average in my book. The powdery taste also translates into a dryness that I just don't dig. The carbonation is spot on and light body really makes this one an easy drinker. All in all no real badness here. Its a satisfying brew and one that you can drink again and again.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,weizenbob,4.5,"12 ounce bottle poured into a flute. I received this in a trade with RamsFan81. Thanks Kurt! Enjoy by date of March 1, 2011 printed on the bottle. Two fingers of bone-white head sit atop this brew. Retention is moderate. The beer is a soft pale golden haze. Lacing is spotty down the wall of the flute. A small amount of carbonation can be seen through the glass.  The aroma is crisp and sharp. Big lager fragrance jumps out of the flute. Sweet hay greets the nose. Some floral hops are detectable. For such a delicate style of beer it is surprisingly aromatic.  The taste is very interesting. Hops sting immediately, coating the mouth with a soapy bitterness. Sweet grassy notes subtly emerge to be replaced by a more grapefruit-like bitterness. As it lingers in the mouth, the hops develop into something more floral in nature. These floral flavors combine with the sweet grassiness to form the aftertaste. It's strange to think of a pilsner as a hop bomb but that's what Prima Pils is, for better or worse.  In the mouth, Prima Pils is light bodied and crisp. Carbonation is moderate and appropriate to style. I could wish that it finished a little cleaner, but that is a mild complaint. 5.3% ABV goes undetected. Drinkability will depend on your taste for hops and European-style lagers. Personally, I'm not a hop-head but despite the strong hoppy bitterness I still found this beer to be incredibly drinkable. It's a very cool twist on an age-old style that I would recommend to fans of pale ale and traditional lager styles alike. Prima Pils is very well done.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,gskitt,4.05,"This was the best of the night for me. Pours a pale, hazy, unfiltered yellow, nice stick. Smelled of hops and lemons and flowers.

345,1010,AlexanderSelby,3.13,"Not as big a fan of this beer as everyone else on this site seems to be (or of the brewery in general), but that's what this is all about: people talking about their own experiences and going with their individual palate. First off, the the color is an opaque yellow which I feel should be reserved for unfiltered wheats. This appearance seems out of place. The nose is definitely this brew's highlight. It has a nice noble (earthy, dirty, subtle) and spicy hops. The taste is where things go array again. Off the bat, I get lemony flavors, again as if this were some type of summer wheat. It then seems to try to finish dry like a pilsner should, but the bitterness is a touch too weak to pull it off.  Overall, this is not what I am looking for in a pilsner. I want crisp, hoppy, refreshingly drinkable, not muddled, citrusy randomness with an wheat-like, dense mouth-feel.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Some citrus as well. Taste is not you average pilsner. Sweet malt with a bit of dough. Some yeast based breadiness. Firm and spicy hop finish with a bit of grapefruit and a lightly sour dryness. Crisp light feel is softly carbonated. Super quenching and drinkinable. An excellent session beer and anything else you may have in mind.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Carbonation is not present throughout the body, which is disappointing, but a great aroma makes up for any shortcomings in the presentation. Very clean malt profile with light floral hops. Just a touch of lemon zest and sweetness in the background. Lager yeast and breads in the bouquet take center stage.  Very bready in the flavor. Biscuit present. Definitely yeasty with a bit of astringency. The light citrus in the nose doesn't show up in the taste at all but instead this brew is more and more malt forward as it approaches room temperature.

Somewhat cloudy yet still transparent. Pale straw yellow in color. Thick lacing.  Simple yet effiective pale pils nose; lemon, grassy hops, and pleasant bready yeast.  Bready yeast, grains, and lots of citrusy hops. Taste is full, especially for a pilsener.  Medium body and quite sessionable. Perfectly carbonated with a lasting finish of the lemon/yeast combo I now know as Prima Pils.  To me, this is going to serve as the benchmark for all pilseners out there.

345,1010,JednoPivoProsim,4.32,"Been looking forward to trying this for awhile.  Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Enjoy by Feb 7, 2011. Big, inviting hop nugget on the front label.  Appearance: Head is a thin white layer. Beer pours almost Mountain Dew-ish yellow from the bottle, but settles as nice light golden color in glass. This beer is fairly cloudy in the glass, not typical for the crisp, clean German pils versions I am used to.  Smell: Fairly clean with faint citrusy hop smell.  Taste: What strikes me immediately about the taste is how dry this beer is. As far as trueness to style goes, the folks at Victory are dead on with this German pils. The hops are noticeable, but by no means overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Again, very dry with crisp carbonation. This beer almost finishes like champagne.  Drinkability: No problems here. Definitely a refresher for the summer (yes, I realize it is Jan 17).  Overall: My humble opinion here, but taste and mouthfeel-wise, Prima is an extremely fair representation of a beer style that is popular nationwide in Germany, but has few accurate imitators here in the States.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,HitokiriNate85,4.92,"A - Straw gold with a bright white cap. Plenty of carbonation streaming up the sides of the glass. Great clarity. Leaves nice sheets of lace down the glass.  S - Herbal and grassy hop notes lead the charge, along with some lemon. Tons of grainy pilsner malt fills the background to make up the best smelling pilsner I've ever had. It's clean and smells so delicious that it's intoxicating.  T - Sharp hop flavors are the first thing I can taste, and on such a clean base it the earthy herbal and grassy flavors don't have to compete with much. The grainy pilsner malt comes in after that, countering the hops and really riding into the finish. What's so good about Prima Pils is that it has a sharpness to it that makes the beer so lively instead of falling flat like some others do.  MF - Light body that dries in the finish that still manages to be lively.  D - If it weren't for the powerful, fresh, grainy pilsner malt, the hops would overwhelm the beer and make it feel like too much. As it stands, it's incredibly refreshing and one of the best beers in the country.  I could and have drank copious amounts of Prima Pils. I'd love to drink a better pilsner than Prima Pils, but until I make a pilgrimage to Europe, I doubt that'll happen.

I've found that I tend to be a bit more partial to ales, however this is one Pilsner that I was able to enjoy more and more with each sip. When I poured Prima into my snifter, I first noticed the cloudy straw color that was that became very inviting. I've had quite a few terrible Pils. that came out very champaign like and almost as clear as water. I was disapointed that the head of the beer disapated rather quickly.  The smell was probably what the minimum should be for a good Pils.  I very much enjoyed the crisp hoppy tast which lingered in my mouth for a bit.

M: Light in body, and the carbonation seems to be lacking a bit.  D: Meh overall. Seems like it is a miss on the noble hops, the bitterness is too much, and it lacks the clean crisp flavor I expect for this style.

Dare I say I smell that yeasty Victory smell? Thats in the best possible way of course.  This is everything you could hope for in a Pilsner. Bright hoppy overtones over a subtle malt background. The two ingredients are perfectly merged.  Nice clean dry, yet full bodied (for a pilsner) mouthfeel. A bit of sweetness lingers on the finish.

Taste is a great crisp balance of the pale malts used and a aggressive hopping style, there is a pretty hoppy pils. But it never becomes too much or one sided, the malts are always there to mellow it out. Distinctly bitter finish with a slight resiny lingering.

Sparkling fine bubbles keep coming up the glass like a good champagne.  Aroma is pretty much all hops. Blooming flowers, citric/fruity and grassy notes. Faint biscuity malts are very discrete in the background. I feel like I'm smelling a bottle of perfume.  Taste starts with bready and doughy malts but it is soon overpowered by an avalanche of aromatic hops: lots of citric orange and lemon upfront, followed by floral, grassy and earthy notes. Bitterness then ensues and it is pretty strong for a pilsen. It finishes very dry with bitter aftertaste.  Body is on the heavier side of light and carbonation is high. Overall this is a very well crafted beer with lots of complexity. It's main flaw (or maybe not!) is the lack of balance between malt and hops, obviously favoring the latter.  Without a doubt the hoppiest Pilsener that I've ever had, and perhaps the best.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

A bit earthy and mild pine.  T- Same spicy hops, not too bitter but very assertive. Dominates the bready malt underneath. A bit grassy/grainy as well.  M- Good carbonation, clean finish. Pretty dry.

Appearance: Very pale golden color with a tight, fizzy head that dissipates quickly and leaves some spotty lacing.  Smell: Has a spicy, herbal hops aroma backed by a bit of sweet maltiness.  Taste: Aggressively bitter up front with strong noble hops flavors. Towards the back it gains a little bit of sweet maltiness and finishes dry and bready. Very good.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and refreshing with a dry finish. Like a pilsener should be.  Drinkability: This is a highly drinkable, highly enjoyable pilsener. This may be the best pils I've had outside of Europe. It definitely has all the qualities that one looks for in a German-style pilsener.

Aroma-Low grainy malt sweetness, almost like graham crackers. Medium floral hop bouquet with big herbal/spicy/noble notes with subtle undertones of light citrus. Slight hint of some yeast character (green apple/fruitiness), though not enough to be off-putting.  Flavor-Simple grainy malt backbone-hops are the star of the show here. Hop bitterness begins medium low, but grows to a moderate bitterness and lingers on through the finish and well into the aftertaste. Hop flavors are earthy, herbal, spicy, and noble. Aside from hops and malt, the flavor is quite clean.  Mouthfeel-Medium light body, medium high carbonation. Well attenuated malt leads to a crisp and refreshing finish.

Drinks very smooth -feel the pinch of hops on the tongue with a lingering grapefruit-like bitterness with a not too wet or dry finish. Overall, a spectacular pilsner with a surprisingly high dosage of hops and honestly, in this category, I think holds its own or surpasses the German counterparts.

The freshness and yard-work come through strong. Hoppy, piney and lemony.  Bitter and strong, that has a biting character of hops. There's an underlying fruit character that's similar to grapefruit. Crisp, dry and sports a long aftertaste that is kind of hit or miss with me.  This is a rather good German beer that I would rather have than a Budweiser; it's sessionable.

Aroma is a medium intensity hops smell, and some biscuity malts smoothly blended in. Taste is...wow. A light hops bitterness comes to he forefront, with a strong backbone of malt. Citric fruit is also blended in, with grapefruit especially standing out. Mouthfeel is light bodied, but it works very well with the citric taste. Drinkability is outstanding, this beer goes down easily and quickly, and I could toss these back allll night.

Biting herbal hops are beautifully meshed with semi-sweet malt. Dry finish brings back the hops again. Tantalizing carbonation and somewhat oily mouth-feel is very pleasant. This is a fine pilsner. Probably the best I have had. An uncommon hops signature with a traditional biscuit malt character. I can't believe how good this goes down.

The taste is tangy, a citrusy bite, but not sweet at all. Hops bitterness is present in the taste and a bit strong in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thicker than the pale color led me to expect. If you like the type this may be a good beer for you, but I don't care for the bitter aftertaste that hangs on the tongue. I won't be going back to this one again, but that's just my taste.

Nice amount of floral hop character up front. The bready malt backbone comes through nicely as well.  M: A nice hop bitterness is left on the palate. There is ample carbonation with this beer.  D: This is a very easy to drink Pilsner.

Head was 2 fingers, pure white and had great retention.  S: Big hop profile here - fresh, floral, piney. Slight bready balancing malt hidden in there.  T: Big on the hops at first glance, but also with fresh light fruits. Balancing malt character in the middle shortly makes an appearance. Finishes very hoppy and slightly dry with grapefruit and floral.  Great, eminently drinakable beer with a big flavor. This is a pils? I'm not so sure.

But it's a fine beer still, Victory knows this style well.  Bottle. Pours a fairly clear straw color with a nice white fizzy head. Nose is fresh wheat, gentle grassy hops and a bit of lemony. Crisp, highly refined flavor. The hops are gentle and meld perfectly with the bright, citric qualities. Has only a bit of lingering bitterness.

There's a lot of carbonation bubbling up from the bottom of the glass; you'd swear there was an aquarium aerator down there! The head recedes fairly quickly and leaves a thin white film on the surface of the beer. Pretty decent lacing as well.  Smell: Nice balance of grainy malt and hops. Aroma is a bit on the funky side (almost like sour bread dough), with some citrus notes brightening things up a bit. Smells bright, fresh, and satisfying.  Taste: There is quite a bit of pleasant bitterness in this one. Flavor is sort of a grassy citrus, with enough malt backbone to lend a smooth, creamy texture and slightly sweet finish. Definitely more hops than I was expecting, but I think that's a good thing!  Mouthfeel: Pretty light-bodied. The hops + carbonation combo make this one zesty and refreshing.

The fruitiness and lavender notes extend to the flavor, creating some interesting notes over the standard pilsner base.  M/D- Smooth, but with a nice, prickly carbonation. Fairly drinkable as well.

Pilsners are usually rather mundane, and even though they are suppossed to have a little more spice hoppiness than a lager, I don't usually find that to be so evident, but in this case it is.

Lots of carbonated bubbles make the exodus from the bottom of my Perfect Pint to the thinning head. Some icicle-esque lacing.  S - Smells quite fruity. Getting a mix of grapes and grapefruit with just the slightest hints of malt and alcohol. Intertwined with all of these smells is an airy, floral tone. Very light and refreshing smelling.  T - With such a crisp nose, I was taken aback by the taste of this one. Rather than getting a crisp taste, I received a fairly bitter brew here. I'm a bit underwhelmed at the moment because I came in expecting a German-styled maltiness that is completely overshadowed by the hops. Tastes more akin to a lighter, more floral IPA. Besides that, the profile does mellow out as it warms, but there's always an overbearing presence of hops.  M - Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. A bit creamy due to the head on this one.  D - Drinkability is moderate. A bit unbalanced for my liking and caught somewhere between a pilsener and IPA without getting the finer features of either.

I'm a self proclaimed master at judging this style and to start on a good note, the malts could not be anymore perfect...well done, really a nice grain bread in the malts without being sweet, only the best of this style can accomplish that. Without argument, this is a super beer but as a German Pilsner, it falls short of what this style is supposed to be.  I can quickly smell and taste the fatal flaw in this beer....HOPS!!! Americans can never seem to get this right. Too much hops and not the proper hops to work with the malts. Good German Pilsners have a spicy and grassy, bitter hop backbone that compliments the malts. This beer has a citrus rind bitter hoppyness that overpowers the malts and leaves the sting of cheap hop pellets in the aftertaste. It's supposed to be a German Pils, not an IPA!  This is slightly paler yellow than other Pils, with a white head that leaves little lacing. Not true to the style but still a tasty drink and one would have no trouble drinking quite a lot of these. This is only so highly rated because so many Americans are hopheads. If one wants a real German Pils, grab a Radeberger!  Still quite pleased with this beer but would not buy it to satisfy a craving for a German Pils.

The hops come through the most in the smell though with a pretty pungent sharp, fruity, herbal note. The taste is fantastic with the pilsner cake malt taste in the beginning then the hops come in pretty sharp and adding some fruity overtones and then the malt comes in again to balance out some of the bitterness. The hops prevail though and leave you with a sharp dry bitterness. This is seriously hoppier then some IPA's I've had. This could almost pass for an IPA because of the dryness bitterness and the fact that they use a light malt to showcase the hops more. You can tell they use German hops instead of American.

The aroma is mild in nature, but hints at being a spicy lemon pepper flavor. The smell has a biscuit like smell almost combining into an aroma that is akin to lemon curd. The taste however is decidedly less exciting. It's a solid pilsener, but lack any depth whatsoever. It's still above average flavor, but not by much. There is a dry crisp lemon and grass flavor spiced with coriander. The saving grace of this beer is that while there is some bitterness to it it drinks really very smoothly and goes down nice and easy.

Taste- A heavier pilsner than I thought, maybe not such a pilsner but more a bitter? It was quite bitter at the finish. Has a lot of hops in it but not quite the noble I was expecting. Tasted more like a small IPA IMHO.  Mouth- It was crisp. It left a small aftertaste. I did like it don't get me wrong I wonder if a fresher bottle maybe at the brewery would have been that much better or if I am not such a pils fan?

Unfortunately, I detect just a hint of booze.  T - LOTS of hops (awesome), sweetish malt balanced by spiciness up front. Very bitter in the back of my mouth and very clean on swallowing. No hint of the booze I smelled. More malt becomes apparent as it warms, and the hops take on more of a tobacco character, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

A: Hazy golden yellow, small bone white head comprised of tiny bubbles, about 1/2 inch tall, settles quickly into a small ring around the edge. Not bad.  S: Cracker like malt, some light grapefruit/citrus hop notes, along with a floral and spicy hop note. The spicy hop reminds me of Hop Devil. The yeast is subdued, but it's there slightly, almost a peppery note. This one smells decent.  T: Wow. This is the best pilsener I've had to date. Very hop forward for the style, with floral and herbal hops, along with a slight bitterness. Very dry, cracker like malt stands up to the bitterness though, and some very slight sweetness works its way into things near the finish. A little bit of the peppery quality that I got in the nose. Very nice flavors here.  M: Light, somewhat thin body, good carbonation, and a dry finish. Not bad.  D: Wow. Just plain drinkable. This one is easy to just drink. The bitterness/hoppiness is counter-balanced by the malt in this one so well, that the bitterness never overpowers it, and allows you to keep drinking without putting you off of it.

The hops linger for a while after the swallow with a aspirin bitterness.  The bitterness is a bit much for me for this style, although I like the flavor on the body quite a bit. I'm not sure if I'd reach for this one when I'm in the mood for a pils, but it's certainly decent.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,Dougal,2.21,this was over hopped to my palate and had a strange aftertaste of bitterness that was not enjoyable. the normal bitter refreshing characteristics are gone and the overly bitter exotic tastes come through in a way you do not want to drink them. This made Urquell's taste seem amazingly more refreshing and enjoyable.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,RRoeb1123,4.45,"Poured into a pilsner glass.  Appearance, Pale yellow, with a quick forming head, about a finger thick. Settles down somewhat quickly to a small head that hangs around.  Smell: First thing that hits your nose is a slight malt scent, with hits of citrus, and a cut lawn scent. A very very slight sulfur scent comes through, but it's not offensive at all.  Taste: The hops certainly come through very quickly! Slight notes of citrus also come through, and the malts quickly sweep up, for a pleasant finish, with a bit of hops coming back at the end.  Mouthfeel is like many other pilsners, but it has its own distinct quality that I can't put my finger on. It's very smooth, and goes down easily.  Drinkability: VERY drinkable, this would make an awesome session beer, and is even a great beer to introduce others to great beer, without throwing them out of their comfort zone too much.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

The hops are extremely flavorful and pungent. Fresh cut grass and herbal. It has a long finish that includes bready malt.  Mouthfeel is thin and crisp, well carbonated.  It's an extremely drinkable beer. It's loaded with flavor, not filling, and refreshing.

345,1010,shand,4.77,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pilsner glass, best by May 2, 2010 (if this is old, how good must a new bottle be?!).  Appearance: Pours a centimeter of head that quickly dissapates with just a few wisps of head retaining. A wonderful slightly translucent straw color.  Smell: Hops! Very hoppy smelling, a bit spicy, with just a bit of grass hanging out in there too.  Taste: Screw Miller Light, this right here is the real ""Great Pilsner Taste"". Hits you right in the face with hops, but they don't stick around. Goes down very smoothly with the citrus and grass flavors sticking out a bit, with a very smooth malt ending. Outstanding for the style.  Mouthfeel: Feels good going down. Crisp and fresh. All there is to it, what more could you want from the style?  Drinkability: Why yes, I'll take another!  I'm very impressed by this beer. It is an outstanding example of the style, and is a great signature beer for Victory. Not too many craft breweries do styles like this, and it's great to see a brewery great at both lighter and heavier styles. One of the best brews I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy poolside with great company. Now if only the company weren't drinking Michelob Ultra...  REVIEW EDIT 1/29/11! I finally, finally, finally found a fresh bottle of this! This has me enjoying by May 3rd, 2011. Much better! The hops are more pungent that I remember, and the taste is super crisp and refreshing.

A big bold beer none the less. Drink well my friends",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,angusdegraosta,4.05,"First review. I figured since I'm drinking this, I might as well start here. I've read some reviewers who describe this as a typical American micro-brew taste. I agree, but we're still dealing with excellence here. The hops are overdone, perhaps, but it's the right kind of hops and the right overall balance.  A good way to experience a well-crafted hoppy beer is let it linger in the mouth a while. Then you taste additional characteristics of the beer. It's been a while since I've had Urquell, and I don't know all there is to know about the style, but I can tell you a few things I observed about Prima. The color is great. I'm having trouble describing the smell, but it's distinctive enough. As far as body and taste, it's not a one-trick pony. Mouthfeel is fantastic - quite enough carbonation, good balance of malt and semi-dry taste.  I'm thinking this would go great with some wurst and red cabbage. Though only 5.3% ABV, it packs a wallop. Savor, don't pound. Tastes just fine as it warms to room temperature.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

M: Thin, smooth, drinkable dry beer with good carbonation.  D: I could drink this all day.

345,1010,greengorilla,4.42,I had this in a pint glass poured from a bottle. It was a nice golden color with a thick white head.  The smell was really good and very hoppy.  It has a crisp pilsner taste. It may be the best pilsner that I have had.  The mouthfeel is quite good. It is very drinkable.  I would definitely recommend this beer. It is a great value. It would be a good beer to keep on hand.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Strategery,2.59,"Reviewing this beer as I'm drinking it at an upper west side bar in NYC.  Appearance- It looks just like a good Pilsener should. Crystal clear gold, with a 1/2 inch head and decent lacing. Certanly looks the part.  Smell- Not bad. A little musky. A friend of mine picks up some smoke, which I don't. We both agree it has a bit of stinky cheese as well as a distinct sour apple smell. Interesting.  Taste- This is where this beer just constantly disappoints me. It is apparently the highest rated German Pilsener on planet earth, and it just seems like the point is lost in this beer. It almost always tastes like Victory added some liquid skunk to this beer. Which I'm sure is from the whole cone Saaz hops, but it just isn't a good example of the style at all. Radeburger, Jever, Bittburger, and even Great Lakes' Prohibition Pils are much better representations of what this style should be. The flat bitterness on the back of the palette is the most disconcerting part. When it's I've cold, it's fairly refreshing, but loses any sublety of flavor once it warms even te slightest bit.  Mouthfeel- Crisp, light. No complaints.  Drinkability- One and done. Which is disappointing for supposedly the best Pilsener on the planet.  Overall- I absolutely love lagers. I'm a contrarian when it comes to most people on this sight in that regard. I've just been constantly disappointed by this beer. The Gaffel Kolsch (an ale I know) and the Radeberger I had prior just showed so much more craftsmanship and subtlety that this beer ultimately just fell short.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,decadance,4.22,"A nearly perfect example of the style. A bit under carbonated for my taste. Smell and taste are dead on with a touch of hoppy bitterness.

Love this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,zhanson88,4.12,"Appearance: Slightly hazy yellow. Head is egg-shell white and only about a finger despite some pretty vigorous pouring. Retention is minimal.  Smell: Crisp and clean, with a hint of pale malts, hops and citrus. Not overly impressive.  Taste: Wow. After the smell I am very surprised. Pale malts and citrus are fairly strong up front, and quite a bit of hoppy bitterness comes at the end. It's probably the tastiest pilsener I've tried.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp with a clean, slightly dry finish. Carbonation is moderate and seems to be about right.  Drinkability: It's not filling and low ABV, so it's very drinkable. Definitely a great substitute for some BMC crap if you're looking to put down quite a few brews. If I had drank this straight from the bottle I would have thought it was unbelievable for a ""lighter"" beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,mklinger,4.03,"Poured into a pilsener glass. Golden yellow, very clear with tons of visible carbonation. Nice billowy head that sticks around really well.  Aroma is bread doughy with some earthy & grassy aromas. Very much a classic noble hop aroma. Smells like a good pils.  Flavor is more complex and better than the aroma. Some pils malt toasty bready character that is quickly overwhelmed by noble hop flavor and a rock solid hit of bitterness. Nicely assertive in the bitterness; it just lasts and lasts. Once of the most intensely hop flavored & bitterest pilseners I've ever had. Maybe a touch too bitter for my tastes but overall a nice beer.  Mouthfeel is light and slightly thin as it should be. Very well carbed which fills it up a bit. Very solid beer. This is an intensely good pilsner. Nice beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Earth, honey, with a hint of black pepper in the finish.  T - Holy Hoppy Pilsner!!1 German hops provide ample bitterness and flavor here. Light spicy, woody, grassy hops are balanced nicely with a biscuit maltiness. This is truly a hophead's pilsner.  M - Light bodied, effervescent, crisp.

M: As light as a typical pilsner. Very dry.  D: I bought this because I've only heard good things about it. I gave it a pretty good review, but I also don't really see what all the hubbub was about.

M- Very dry palate. Refreshing though.  D- I could drink a few of these. Recently had a couple playing a round of golf. The abv is not that high, is pretty smooth. Just not my style though.  Notes: This will probly be the highest I rate a Pilsner. Pilsners are my least favorite type of beer, dont know why just think they're very bland.

Smell - Wow.. what an inviting fresh scent. Pine nuts, hops, lemon zest, apple juice all come to mind. Probably one of the cleanest freshest smelling beers I've come across.  Taste & Mouth - The beer has an absolutely amazing moth feel. It has the perfect amount of carbonation to fit with the flavour of the beer.

Big bitter hop bite to start off that stays prevalent throughout the entire time its in your mouth. Follows up with some maltiness and some substantial floral flavoring that lingers into the aftertaste. Just lots of hoppy bitterness all around. Unexpected, and I hope it's not because the beer is past the date. Mouthfeel is only average, with a lot of carbonation and a lightish body. Finish is quite dry.  Drinkability is average.

The color is straw with a fizzy wet head that dissipates quickly, leaving a nice ring around the glass and thin islands of fizz on the surface. Quite attractive pilsner.  The nose is mostly pale malt with subtle minty German hops. Reminds me a lot of fresh wort coming off the stove, which I feel is a pungent aroma for the style, but in a memorable positive way.  On the palate, the menthol of the hops comes through to the forefront immediately. They are a little harshly bitter at first, but then warming and pleasant, if somewhat medicinal, especially as the beer warms in your mouth. The malt aroma doesn't carry through to much in the way of flavor, but I would not expect any sweetness from this brew. The texture is thin but mouth coating, it has pretty good legs for a low gravity beer. At the finish, the hops can be a little one-note and overwhelming.  This is my last in the six pack, which I have drunk slowly over the course of the last week or so. This beer has grown on me a bit, the more I sat and lingered with it.

Perhaps that is a poor descriptor-- but most beers do not fell like water to me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,berkey,4.15,"12 oz bottle with listed best by date of 11/08/10. Poured into a Pilsener flute and reviewed 08/07/10.  Highly delicate carbonation can be easily seen against a very lucid golden blonde body. The beer is crowned by a well retained, thick, and rocky head that really does the style proud.  Aroma is very hoppy with floral, herbal and spicy notes dominating. I'm having trouble thinking of many beers that showcase European hop aroma as well as this one. Malt sweetness seems also turned up slightly from most other beers in the style which actually helps maintain the pleasant balance that helps define the style.  Hops take a bitter and grassy turn on the entry but the flavors even out mid sip. This beer seems to turn up the volume on the hop character that make a German Pils great without losing the easy drinking appeal.  Not exactly the same as the versions I tried in Germany but excellent in it's own right and covers enough of what I look for in the style to make it a likely go-to if it were locally available. Highly recommended, probably top five domestic versions of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,PantherLightning,4.43,"Pours bubbly, white, beautiful one finger head. Light straw color. Smells very floral.  Tastes light, crisp and hoppy. It is very delicate and yet assertive in flavor. Very clean finish that leaves a floral taste far back on the pallet. Mouthfeel is very crisp on the first few sips and smooths out as you drink through the beer. Leaves a nice lacing around the glass.  I could drink this beer all day everyday and never get sick of it. Prima Pils does every single thing right that all BMC pilsners do wrong, and it shows. This beer is beautiful.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,grittybrews,4.44,"Poured a rich straw yellow into a tulip with a quick-fading film of head. Slightly soapy, hop-forward aroma of lemon and grass.  Moderate carbonation and a very smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Mild overall flavor with a touch of citrus hops and a stronger presence of bready malt. Nicely hoppy and ever-so-slightly metallic finish.  Really well-balanced and so easy-drinking. I didn't care for this beer the first couple times, but I'm fairly sure the first one was old/flat, and the second time around I was just plain wrong. Really enjoyable brew!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ryanmac06,4.45,A - Golden straw with a finger of light head. I wish the froth on this one could have been a bit thicker. Suitable carbonation that rises throughout the entirety of the whole beer.  S - Not overly strong but it does the trick for a pils. It's earthy and hoppy.  T - This is about as good as it gets for being a pils. Starts out malty and ends with a medium hoppy bitterness. It's perfectly balanced and refreshing.  M - Coats the mouth perfectly. It stays on my palette for a while after finishing the drink. It's buttery and the carbonation helps crisp this up.  D - I could drink this all day. It's one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. It's balanced without being overly bitter and can accompany many different foods.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Ring around the glass with some lacing.  S- Malty and herbal aromas start a pleasant smell that reveals the hop aroma almost from the beginning of the beer. A certain bread and earthy aroma is also available as the hops continue throughout the beer.  T- A sweet grainy taste approaches for a moment before being pushed away by a dominating hop presence. A spicy hop presence picks up in the middle of the beer as it is complimented by an earthly and grassy flavor. The earthy flavors continue into the aftertaste along with a slight bitterness and some sweetness.  M- A nice medium light body with a smooth crisp feel. Beer finishes slightly dry to create a refreshing mouthfeel.  D- Nice, smooth and easy to drink. Clean pilsener that is quite refresh",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,steveh,4.08,"Always liked the Victory beers, just difficult to find them in N. Eastern Illinois.  Enjoy by Nov. 21, 2010.  A -- Clear, golden color with a dense, off-white head that settles slowly.  S -- Vaguely lemony esters up front, betting more from hops than fermentation. Some mild biscuit malt following.  T -- Wow. Sweet, bready malt up front, mild spicy bitterness in the finish. A good balance of both breadiness and spiciness lingers in the aftertaste. More great malt character than I've had from a Micro Lager in a long time.  M -- Body is light to medium light and mouthfeel is crisp and dry.  D -- Very good, but suffers from the cloyingness I often get with highly hopped Noble Hop beers. I could drink a couple, but they'd get heavy on the palate after that.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,IronLover,4.47,Pale yellow in color with a light haze. Nice white head that leaves behind wet lacings. Light floral aroma with hints of grain and grass. Refreshing carbonation and buttery smooth feel to the body. Light malty-biscuity flavor with hints of spice and butter and a nice bitter hoppy dry finish. A great pilsner on a hot summer afternoon. Very refreshing and extremely drinkable. The 22oz bottle did not last long.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,detlefchef,3.25,"Classic clear and blond color with reasonably thick, white head.  Super fragrant with aromas of citrus (grapefruit) and, actually, agave nectar. Some peach as well.  There's a quality about several victory beers I've had of late (well, just this and the Helios) that I'm not that into. That is, a somewhat caustic bitter end. In this case, it dominates so much that I have a hard time enjoying the rest of the beer. You can tell it's good inside, but for this quality. And the bitter taste lingers. Not your typical hoppy bitterness, but a caustic quality.  That sort of knocks down the final 3 grades.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

I'm embarrassed to say I can't pinpoint the herb. I want to say either basil or rosemary. Right now I'm in a very green forest of herbs. It's hard to tell what they are but they are all very dry. They herbs taste like dried herbs. I've had herb beers before but this is a whole new level. Overall I love it. Because it's a pilsner I thought it would be very mellow but the hops and malt are perfect and the herb flavor...I don't know where it comes from...maybe I'm crazy...but its amazing M - PBR D - If I was stranded on a desert island and I could only have three things...,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Bravo!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jwhancher,4.8,"An excellent delicate tasting and smelling beer. The noble hops reign supreme. Clearly a great tasting summer beer but just as much year-round.

345,1010,Bouleboubier,4.82,"A truly unique pils.  Bright, antique canary or icterine yellow. Kind of like the color of absinthe (a stretch?). The head pours at least a half inch thick and as much as 2+ finger width. It has a compressed soft cotton texture and a silky snappy feel. Very purdy and elegant.  The aroma is unlike anything I've experienced. Effervescently hoppy and aromatic. Soft lemon accents the pungent, electric, herbaceous kick. Fresh, biting, and reminiscent of sage.  Full of amazingly vibrant flavors. The lemon comes out more - in essence and not acidity or sour. The hops are up front - grassy, shrubaceous, vaguely peppermint. Just enough malt character to carry the recipe. Softly sweet.  For all the zest and spice, the beer knows when and how to drop off. Packing a refreshing dose of carbonation and finishing crisp, dry, and faintly tart, a grassy, citrus sweet flavor does linger long after the last sip, awakening the mouth and cleaning the palate.  The beer is distinctly a pilsner but exudes a majestic and sophisticated construct that sets it in a class of its own. Brilliant work. Phenomenal beer to pair with a wide variety of light fare.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,TMoney2591,3.66,"Served in a flute glass at ChurchKey.  Wow, how has it taken me so long to drink and review this beer? It pours a clear pale straw topped by a half-finger of white foam. The nose is faint (as I've come to expect from these pilsners), comprising only some wheat and light florals. The taste follows, a bit stronger, with notes of floral and citrus peel bitters and a very light background bit o' biscuits. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a solid pils, but nothing to get all that uppity about.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Appearance: Slightly hazy golden color with a very small white head that leaves more lace than expected when it's gone.  Smell: For the most part, distinctly European hop aromas- flowers and grass. Light buttered sweetness.  Taste: Begins with a sweet tea flavor, finishing with a pleasant herbal hoppiness. Mild sweet butter notes. When it's gone, a sweet, grassy flavor is left in the mouth.  Mouthfeel: Light, crisp body and a slightly dry finish.  Drinkability: A faithful interpretation of a German style, well-balanced and enjoyable. Definitely a beer I wouldn't mind drinking again.

I love the taste of this beer - the grains from the nose carry over nicely to the palate. Very smooth and clean going down with just the right amount of hop bite on the back-end. Light bodied with good carbonation. This is infinitely drinkable and one of the best pilseners I have ever tasted.

Butter, grain and corn are the most prevalent scents on display, followed by hints of sweetness and a bit of alcohol. This is a more enticing twist on the ""usual"" beer smell.  The taste is a pleasing blend of buttered biscuits, slight hopping, a little spice and mild dryness. There is no skunkiness or bitterness on display, which I think is the downfall of most American lagers. There's also the tingle of carbonation, which acts a nice counterpoint to the smooth and buttery mouthfeel.  You just can't deny how easy this is to drink. It might be one of the most drinkable beers on the planet and it has definitely provoked an interest in the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Has a nice barley malt smell, like a typical pilsner. Mild hops in the smell as well.  The mild smell belies a very flavorful beer. Starts crisp, with some hopped bite that hits you mid throat. Some pleasant astringency supported by grassy flavor, with a little bit of tobacco.  Has a crisp, lighter mouthfeel.

Lemon zest, skunk, yeast, grass appear in the nose. Nothing dominating, all of the smells blend together.  The first taste is that of a grassy nature. This blends into lemon and a bit of yeast. The aftertaste resembles the bitterness of grapefruit with grass. Plenty of hops hold the pils in place.  The bubbles play games while it rests in my mouth. It is relatively thin, but normal for a pilsner. The aftertaste is clean and crisp, quite refreshing.  A wonderful session beer, I would be happy to drink multiples of this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,mzrebiec,4.38,"Let me start by saying that I do not enjoy the Pilsner style.  That being said, this is delicious. Prima Pils pours a light golden color with an average head that sticks around for a bit and laces nicely on the pilsner glass. The flavors are crisp and consist of citrus and pine. The hops are obviously dominant in the flavors although a bit of light malt comes through. Definitely a great pilsner to enjoy on a hot summer day.

Average head retention with minimal lacing.  The aroma was of noble hops with the likes of Saaz? Along with this I get pale malt and earthy herbal smell. Some sort of grains also play a role which I can not just put my finger on.  The taste was that of slight sweet upfront with hops. Alongside some pale malt and slight caramel maybe?  Mouthfeel is light bodied and very crisp and refreshing.  Overall this is a great example of a pilsener and this beer actually taste quite like Sam Adams-Noble Pils, except this being slightly better.

The nose is complex with several notes distinguishable. Earthy notes from the hops and fresh bready malts come through.  The mouth is crisp and mostly dry with a hint of sweetness at the very last moment. Definitely has a good malty body for a pils.

Very dry and bitter as well, in a good way true to the style. Also getting a hint of lemon flavor. Very drinkable, goes down easy, great for a warm summer day.

There was a ton of carbonation during the pour that moderates as it settles. A bunch of sticky rings were left on the glass.  S- Classic pils. Sweet, cereal/bready malt combined with grassy, herbal/spicy hops.  T- I thought it was really well balanced. Plenty of doughy/grainy malts in the background with a good dose of hops that came off as grapefruity, spicy, and grassy at different points. There was some berry-like sweetness through the middle. The hops come through in the end to clean up the finish. My wife thought it was ""too hoppy.""  M- Moderate carbonation. Slight, spicy tingle. Clean throughout with a dry finish.

Aside from a lack of head, it is a nice looking beer.  S There was a little light struck aroma at first, but faded with time.

Slow bead trail up the glass, looks like a pretty awesome quaffing lager.  Nose is a sponge-cakey malt affair with a nice crisp, dry bitterness coming through as well. Some light sweetness and fruitiness blends with the bitters, hints of gooseberry, lemon and maybe some passionfruit on there. Bitterness is crisp, slightly metallic. A pleasant lager smell indeed.  Taste is funny, actually. Very rich and astringent throughout, with an odd, heavy maltiness playing prominently as well. Slight fruity sparkle on the front, a hint of green grape skin and lemon, then oddly sweet with a pancake batter maltiness and a hint of currants or something as well. Bitterness is metallic and alkaline throughout, noticeable mostly on the back with its astringency not cleaning up as well as it could, but not being overly strong, just most noticeable on the back. An interesting drop that I think suffers from lack of substance on the front, leaving it unprotected and unbalanced on the bitter finish.  Not bad feel though actually. Noticeable texture and malty body with a smooth feel, not sticky and no trace of carb sizzle. Some sizzle would be expected from a lager but I'm not very disappointed to find it missing.

345,1010,appenzeller,3.75,"At the outset, I'm a big pilsner fan, my favorite style.  Appearance: off the mark for a true pilsner. Pours a thin head with minimal lacing, the beer lacks clarity and has closer to the opaqueness of a weissbier, a real no-no for pilsners.  Smell: Good, floral aroma of Saaz hops but overpowering.  Taste/Mouthfeel: This beer has a good taste, I love hops and heaven knows there's plenty of it here--the quality of the hops is evident, too. Tastes strongly of bitter citrus, refreshing and light. No maltiness evident. I could drink this anytime, for sure, but it lacks the complexity, balance and subtleties of the world's great pilsners. This is a standard American take--good tasting, but focusing on aggressiveness and overpowering taste over refinement. That's off the mark for a pilsner.  I rate this beer well, it's a nice brew. It's just not really a pilsner--Victory should market it differently. For contrast, Trumer is another American brew that fits the style better. But this is still a beer I wouldn't turn down, a real nice brew and it's too bad this is tough to find here on the West Coast.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

It was surely a good beer, considerably better than I recall Trumer or St Pauli, but I cant say it is a style I would go back to often or purposefully.  Overall, I was disappointed most in the smell, which for me at least, was fairly underwhelming. Flavor-wise though it was surely a vast improvement. You can tell these are quality ingredients, and I enjoyed the earthy and lemon zesty hops.

It started out with a thick, bright white foamy head but settled down to a thin covering within a minute or so.  The Noble hops really come through in the aroma with a bold, spicy, grassy, earthy flavor. A crisp lemony, citrusy flavor also comes through pretty well in the nose.  The nose suggested the hops were going to be bold, but the taste really surprised me with just how bold they were. It has a huge earthy, grassy and spicy noble hop presence to it. The citrus comes through a bit in the finish but not a lot. The hops leave a lingering spicy, moderately bitter flavor in the finish.  Mouthfeel is light with a little above average carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it definitely showcased the noble hops very well.

Delicate but prominent bitterness comes through on the finish; it's mostly clean on the finish, with just a hint of a rough, grassy edge.  Mouthfeel: Light  Drinkability: I've yet to find lagers with high doses of Noble Hops to be particularly drinkable, but this would be good for one or two.

This is the essence of beer  I could drink this beer all day long, for years.  12oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass. Perfect clarity below in the blonde golden body. Up top there's a two finger, crema head composed of larger bubbling. It recedes within a quick minute, leaving a thin ring and some decent lacing.  zesty orange on the top of the nose, with a wide backbone of honey wheat bread. Honey-dipped orange is an apt descriptor, especially as the beer begins to warm, a sweetness emerges. The beer loses a bit of it's crispness at this point...  On the tongue: It's a dollop of honey sweetness at the start immediately starting it's dance with a zippy citric bite. Quick crisp flow across the tongue with striking carbonation. Never 'arcs' per-se... just travels right through. the traveling is nice though as a light honey kiss continues to mingle with the carbonation and now the emerging hop presence. Refreshing bite as the carbonation reaches your throat. The bubbling unleashes a tinge of slightly metallic/copper hoppiness on the tonsils. This lingers as the rest of the beer washes away...All that's left now is a strong presence of floral-like noble hoppiness. A loong finish contineus to spread into an earthen echo. Musty in the throat, satisfying and reminding you that another sip is needed now.  Great job on the mouthfeel - light and almost effervescent, but still providing an anchor of body. The effect is a great sense of refreshment, while still feeling like I've imbibed a substantial beer.  It does not get any more drinkable than this beer. Fantastic interpretation of the style. A great beer for my 100th review.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,czfreeman,4.42,"On a recent visit from my Dad, he brought me a few bottles of Victory Prima at my request to see how it stacks up after drinking only German beers over the last year. On the pour-Picturesque Pils. Light, highly carbonated, solid 2 finger head,medium bodied, lasts for a appropriate amount of time. Smell is where the American influence comes into play. The crisp German malt quality is there as a solid, light bready backbone, but the hops come into to play in a big way. German Pils rely on the crisp light Hallertau in a slightly more restrictive way, this on displays a slightly more aggresive hop profile with a nice Saaz spice as well. I like the peppery aspect, and the slightly sweet rounded tone on the finish, a difference from the slightly mineral dominated not in many German examples. Excellent Flavor is such a welcome change from the norm. Tradition and innovation from a new era in one sip. The light bready malt backbone is there as foundation, then followed by a light apricot, pepper, piney hoppiness that is definably American. The brew finishes with a light tongue tingling spiciness and nice hop bitterness. It replaces the normal mineral finish with citrus and cleansing spice. I appreciate the classic German style immensely, but this really opns my eyes to the American craft breweries range of even the most simple styles. I always appreciated this beer, but never really noticed the intriguing complexity or how much the subtle differences really make in it from the German Brewers. Sometimes you have to be away from something for a while to really appreciate. A real treat, and very enjoyable.

A: Served into a pilsener-style glass, this beer pours a clear yellow-gold and had a tightly cropped 1 finger head that faded rapidly. Lazy carbonation bubbles meander northward. The lacing decorates the glass with relatively thick tree-notch residues.  S: The aroma of this beer is quite biscuity and also had some corn, and Granny Smith apple notes. I faintly smell spicy hops. I wonder if this has faded because the bottle is older.  T: Mmm, quite tasty. I taste a nice, spicy hop balance to the pale malts, a quality I really appreciate in a Pilsener. The malts lend a sweet, creamy, almost buttery taste. The flavor somewhat reminds me of spicy apple.  M: This beer displays a good balance between crispness, refreshment, and creaminess. The hop presence lends a satisfying drying feel at the end of each pull.  D: Nicely light and refreshing, but with enough complexity to really expend some brainpower examining its merits. Very drinkable and I'll be going back to this beer when it actually warms up in the great state of Michigan.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,EbPhrygian,3.92,"This is my fifth bottle of a six-pack that I've been working on for probably a couple of weeks. Was kind of hyped about this one.  Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: A rather translucent honey color. Leaves minimal head, even when vigorously poured, and what there is doesn't retain all that well. No lacing to speak of.  Smell: Lemony citrus notes strike first, followed by a piny hop character.  Taste: Bitter and hoppy, especially in the after-taste. There just isn't much going on here, simple and to-the-point, although I wasn't expecting a great deal of complexity in the taste.  Mouthfeel: Pretty carbonated, doesn't stick to the teeth, tongue, or throat.  Drinkability: Wrong place and time for this beer? Sitting indoors at home in the early evening on a 50º cloudy spring day. I never wanted another, though it would not be a laborious endeavor whatsoever. This smooth, crisp brew goes down with minimum effort.  Notes: I have a lot to say about this beer. First of all, it should be enjoyed cold, like right out of the fridge at 37º. The reason for this is it can't be enjoyed fast enough to prevent that unpleasant sensation that your drink is too warm. Second, I like Sam Adams Noble Pils much better. Finally, it just doesn't have anything going for it. It's a Pilsener with more of a hop taste than a strong malt profile, and as such I just can't recommend it over most of the ales I've enjoyed. Just wished there was more to it, something to further separate it from the mass-produced BMC products that boast ""Pilsener taste."" If this is how a pilsener is supposed to taste, then I'm not sure it's my favorite style.

Wonderful and light, it has all the flavor that a well-built pils should exhibit. Just a hint of malt and hops; it's the crispness that stands out.

Tempestuous whirlwind of carbonation obscures the clarity of the body for quite some time. Eventually it begins to shine like stained glass - a light very pale pear color with a solid finger of ivory suds which persits very well and laces in ornate yet compact tendrils.  Floral aromatics, suggesting roses and a hint of alfalfa. Slightly cracker-like (not quite vegetal) pale malt as well, but not ""pissy"" at all.  Quite grassy on the palate with rosemary and wildflower flavors as well. A pleasing bitterness from noble hops along with an almost sterile cleanliness from the malt. Vague hints of green apples and white corn (not DMS, not ""grainy"") in the finish as well - though it concludes very dry.  Smooth, heavily carbonated, medium-light bodied.

This is a chilly rainy May day--not the sunny summertime I often associate with a Pils--but I had a taste for this one, and I'm glad I went for it.  Prima poured into my pilsner glass with a nice inch-and-a-half collar that settled down to a fine wreath of foam around the beer. The color is light-medium gold. The beer has a slight haze--reminds me of the hop-tannin haze that is often found in a Pilsner Urquell rather than the stark crystal clarity of a German pils. For that, I downgraded it, because everything else about this beer--including the name, says ""Pils.""  The aroma is clean, grassy-hop-and-malt. Light, but just right. The flavor is very pils-appropriate. Nice sweet malt balanced--in fact over-balanced--by crisp, clean grassy hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium full, dry, crisp, but not as crisp as it would be with slightly less (and less ""oily"" hop bitterness). Nonetheless, the flavor balance is very typical of the style. The carbonation is just right: a bit more bubbly than ""medium,"" but certainly not ""gassy."" Lots of little pinpoints on the tongue!  This is a very drinkable beer. It's refreshing, but substantial in flavor. I could have another (and I might), but one is quite satisfying on its own.

The beer is mostly clear with a billowy head of sticky foam that left copious amounts of lace down the sides.  The smell assures you that you have indeed poured a pilsner. Czech hops and crystal malts merge perfectly into what this style should smell like and that most American-style lagers can only aspire to.  Very flavorful, very Czech, with grassy aspects. The malt is there, but the dryness brought on by the hops (I'm assuming Saaz) leaves no sense of sweetness.  Bitter acidity in the back of the throat, but crisp up front. Not my favorite experience, but what is standard for the style. This is not a ""neutral"" pilsner and expect it to assert its Czech roots, despite being brewed in Pennsylvania.  Goes exceptionally well with pizza and when drank ice cold is very refreshing and crisp.

Ii liked their Golden Monkey and Hop Devil better, since I thought they had more complexity in their flavor. But, this is definitely great for a warmer day. Not too many notes on this one, just something I jotted some impressions on after a long Saturday.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jjboesen,4.12,"Snowbound during consecutive blizzards, I needed to survive. Rather than cannibilizing my children for substinence, I opted to crack a few bottles of this fine German pilsner.  The initial pour creates a thick foamy gusher, one which is soon to settle. The color is light gold, a translucent body that welcomes a bright sheen of natural light. It is clean looking; there is a quick moving school of carbonation bubbles within, all of them racing to the top. The nose receives a thick slab of wet grass that finishes with a subtle teasing of lemony furniture polish. The palate cannot decide which is more potent: the sweet malt tease or the pleasant hoppy blast. Perhaps, they balance out one another? The beer is crisp - as a good pilsner should be. This is an excellent pilsner, one that makes up for a quaff that occurs in snow choked Maryland instead of the beautiful cobbled streets of Prague.  A wonderfl summer beer ... yes; but one that makes for a pleasant quaff even in amidst the doldrum of winter.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

T-Citrus hops (lemon predominantly), some spice and buscuity malt. Its not terribly complex at all, but its very well done and balanced.  M-Somewhat dry and crisp. Clean finish.  D-Very easy drinking. This would be a great session beer.  I'm not one who is quick to reach for a pilsener, but this one pleasantly surprised me. Good job by Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,voteforgoat,4.34,"Got inspired by the BAs for this one. First time I saw it, so I picked one up. Had a bad experience with Victory before, but BAs convinced me to give the brewery another try. I was not disappointed.  A - average blond, clear lager color, mild carbonation - at least less than expected.  S - delicate hops  T - Great! Very refreshing. Floral, bitterness from the hops, more than any lager I remember drinking.  M- Thin, less bubbly than expected. I'm satisfied with it.  D - Excellent. Would work well with BBQ or any hot summer activity. This is a beer that easily qualifies as a ""thirst quencher when mowing the lawn"" for the BMC crowd, but it actually tastes good! Kinda like SNPA meets crisp pilsner, to put it in broad terms.  GF stole the glass from me and liked it. She says "" Whoa..taste like tecate, but weird..with..like a bitter honey taste??""  I'm not sure how the hops would work with Korean or Japanese food, but it might be a good candidate if you're cooking korean ribs instead of Hite.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Drazzamatazz,3.6,"Poured into Sam Adams Perfect Pint, review compiled from notes over multiple drinking experiences.  A: Interesting color, mostly due to shape of glass. Goes from almost clear at the bottle where it's thinnest to hazy cornstock at the top. Produced a slight head that faded quickly.  S: Lemon, slight lime, peppery, yeast tang.  T: Thin to biting. Initial taste is all from aroma then comes a mouthful of Saaz hops. Pepper lingers for a bite until lemon washes it all away.  M: Thin but quite carbonated.  D: For me this is a style I need to drink while I eat. Not quite interesting enough to want to keep exploring, but sharp enough to want something to balance it with.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

S: The aroma isn't that strong but it's a good mix between floral hops and malts. T: There's a lot of hops in the flavor, which lend some bitterness, but there's plenty of underlying malt so they are not overpowering. It has a very bold and assertive taste for a pilsner style. M: It feels light-bodied, crisp and a bit dry on the palate. D: Drinking this is a breeze; it quenches your thirst and is a good sessionable beer with a big taste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

The aroma is a light hoppy scent with some nice zesty citrus notes. The flavor is of more zesty citrus hops, with some very light but pleasant grassy and herbal notes. The mouthfeel is enjoyable, though the carbonation is a bit strong for my liking.

345,1010,wspscott,3.83,"12oz bottle in Sam Adams glass (best by May 25 2010)  A: Very pale gold or yellow color with a two finger white head that drops quickly and leaves a lot of lace. S: Lemony citrus hops with a little bit of floral hints. Grainy, bready, husky bits under the hop aroma. T: Very hops focused, lots of spicy, floral, lemon flavors. There is a definite sharpness to the hops combined with some grainy character from the malt. As it warms, the hops get a little more sharper, but the aroma doesn't get stronger. M: Very crisp, lots of big carbonation bubbles. D: An excellent example of the style, very easy to drink and an excellent change from APAs. Highly recommended.  * Note: I had this immediately following a Stoudt's Pils. Here are some things that occurred to me. The Prima Pils seems to be a little less crisp, slightly less attenuated with a little more grain character. The aroma hops seem more present in the Stoudt's. Both are very good pilsners, if you like one, you should try the other. Tomorrow, I will edit my Stoudt's review after I start with the Prima Pils.  * 2 days later, I just started with Prima Pils and my impressions/rating doesn't change.

345,1010,SpdKilz,4.1,"Appearance - Pours into my SA Perfect Pint with a relatively clear, mellow, light yellow color. About two fingers of head is achieved, which dissipates rather slowly leaving decent lacing.  Smell - Hops, lemon, slight skunky smell (hopefully not a bad bottle?), and sweet malts.  Taste - A rather spicy note is tasted up front which is followed by plenty of hoppy goodness and lots of different bitter citrus notes such as lemon and orange. A slightly bitter overall taste, however, this is not was I was expecting going into it. I've only had a couple other Pils before, one of them being the new SA Noble Pils. I didn't particularly care for the SA version (it wasn't bad by any means, just not my style) and I had heard so many people stating that the Victor Prima Pils was better. I saw a single and snagged it to give it a try, and honestly, it is better. The tastes are more subdued and mellowed, yet there is plenty of complexity with the different flavors showing up at different times, then a nice semi-malty/sweet backbone finish. This is a pretty darn good beer.  Mouthfeel - Lighter mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation that prickles the tongue, and finishes relatively dry.  Drinkability - High. As stated, I was not expecting to particularly like this going into it, but honestly, I could easily see myself picking up a six pack of these during the summer months. This is a perfect summer beer, with it both being sessionable and crisp/light. Not bad, not bad at all.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Turbansurfer,4.18,"a traditional german pils with a bit more flower than you might expect.  The brew is always crystal clear and pours with a slight head that usually hold together fairly well. A very smooth start, middle and finish with a tinge of bitter in the in the middle.

It pours a very pale golden, yellow color, I had a fine thick head. it smell is mellow, you get hints of its hoppy & bitter nature. It taste complex. The taste is reminiscent of a IPA, yet its not. Its slightly spicy, and not to bitter. Its moutfeel is very crisp, a lot of very active carbonation. Drinkability, this is quite a nice beer. I could easily put several of these down in a row, however, I might tire of its hoppy nature over time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ReadyFireAim,4.17,"Purchased locally; freshness date of July 19, 2010.  Aroma: Man! These hops just punch you right in the face -- and I'm OK with that! It's all about the hops, with this Pils. Citrus-like zest and spicy hops being carried by the strong carbonation. Very well done.  Appearance: Straw yellow and pretty much clear. The head shrunk pretty quickly and formed a half-finger halo that helped carry some of the aroma. Highly effervescent. Good lookin' brew.  Flavor: Again, all about the hops, here. Up front it smacks you with some spicy, floral and citrus notes, and slowly reveals a light grainy backbone (with some slight DMS in there, I picked up).  Mouthfeel: A bit too astringent for me to have more than a couple, but per the style it was pretty well done. Bitterness was high, but not over the top. What really helps highlight these hops is high attenuation from the yeast. Aside from a slight maltiness on the back, you get mostly highly-carbonated hops. It's a great thing but I think it could quickly become a bit annoying.  Overall: I could see sipping on a couple of these in front of the grill on a nice summer evening. A good rendition of the style, with some nice accents on the hops. As the bottle says: Prost!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,tronester,4.57,"Pours a hazy yellow, with a big white head and lacing that does not go away. Smell is of freshly cut flowers and a hint of clean yeast. Taste is an herbal, grassy flavor up front, with a hint of malt in the middle, and a bracing, super hoppy aftertaste. The bitterness clings to your tongue, and wont go away. As a huge fan of hop bitterness, this is wonderful. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, nice medium carbonation. Super drinkable, this is 'true pilsner' taste. I would love to get this again, but it will be difficult as it is not available in Oklahoma.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BigIrishman,4.77,"Appearance: Ever so slightly darker than a straw golden color. Nice big fluffy white head sits on top and is fuel by tons of bubbles coming from everywhere throughout the brew.  Smell: Lemon and sweet saaz hops jump in after the fruit.  Taste: Herbal spices start off strong and that smooth lemon comes in right after. The whole brew is completely balanced by a very light delicious malt character. This beer just doesn't let you just have one.  Mouthfeel: Light and crisp with a clean finish that leaves the mouth with a tingly feeling that is just plain awesome.  Drinkability: This is Pilsner for me, the start and the finish. Victory has crafted this unbelievably drinkable beer into what I believe is one of the finest renditions of a really classic style. When someone is just starting off drinking craft beer (or beer in general as well) I not only recommend Prima Pils I'll go and pick it up for them.

345,1010,zoso493,4.28,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle that is reaching its best-by date in about month. Let's hope it kept up well.  Appearance: Pours a bright yellow that contains only minimal traces of orange to it. It's hard to say a beer of this complexion is hazy, but it's certainly more difficult to see through than a lot of other pilseners. Atop the beer, is a sheet-white, two finger head that dissipates quickly, leaving some small traces of lacing behind.  Smell: The smell is mostly of grain, with some herbal, grassy hops playing a nice secondary role. I fear this beer is faded, because I bet the hops usually play a slightly larger role. It's got a bit of a barnyard scent to it, as well, which is more than fine by me.  Taste: The taste pretty much follows the scent with the graininess playing a predominant role, but the hops are more than adequately present. This is not a hugely complex brew, but is extremely satisfying and a great take on the style.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is decidedly medium-bodied with a higher amount of carbonation, as you would expect. The grainy hops give a nice bittering finish that make this beer exceeding crisp and dry.  Drinkability: Prima Pils would make a fantastic session beer on a hot day as it's low in ABV, on the lighter side and exceptionally refreshing. This is a great beer to buy in a six pack and use as a thirst-quencher on a scorching summer day.  Overall, Prima Pils is a very good example of the style and a very good beer. This bottle is a little old and I suspect it might be a little hoppier as a younger beer, but the hops definitely still let you know they're there. This is a great summertime brew session brew and I highly recommend it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Doesn't leave much lacing, but head stays intact nicely. Aroma is quite hoppy, light lemon + orange, still a bit of macro-esque lager smell which I'm not a fan of. Taste is really hoppy, definitely holds it own against many IPAs. Flowery hops, fruity apricot-like zest, nice warm bread aftertaste. Tart, fruity finish. Mouthfeel is good, not watery thin at all, lots of carbonation but fits well for this beer. Admittedly this is not my favorite style but I can appreciate it for what it is.

M: Crisps slightly, a little watery/thin and satisfying on a warm summer day. Spicy finish from both hops and carbonation. lingering bitter hop dryness. Perfect for the style again.  D: yes...Pils = drinkability and this one delivers. Keeps you enamored, more than enough to keep you interested in persuing another one. Perfect style, perfect beer for drinkability.

Taste - Starts with a translation of the smell into taste...sweet with no bitterness. I really like the way the bitterness is built into this pils. It comes on middle to late in the sip but then vanishes cleanly, leaving only a little on the back of the tongue. Sometimes its not just how good the flavor is, it is how it comes and goes that can make a beer unique for me. It ends a bit spicy.  Mouthfeel - Just right for pilsener. Feels just like a certain famous Czech pilsener in the mouth.  Drinkability - This is a solidly drinkable beer. All the elements are there. It is perhaps a bit strong tasting to have more than one or two in my opinion.

Visible carbonation coming up from the bottom of the glass. One of the clearest, lightest colored beers I've ever seen. The head could have been a little taller, it was really kind of weak looking compared to other pilseners.  Nose - Grainy with a spicy hop aroma. Very good display of the Noble hops. Not really earthy at all but very spicy.  Taste - The hop spice comes through but it is also a little flowery, the combination comes off a bit soapy to me. Bready after taste.  Mouthfeel - Thin body, lots of carbonation and a dry finish.  Overall - I would drink it again but only when I can't get Noble Pils. The flavors don't blend well and that soapy flavor is kind of weird.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Aroma is of sweet grainy malt, straw and, zesty hop aromas. Taste is even more zesty with wonderful lemony citrus, herbal and grassy hop notes. The beer has a firm bitterness that makes it nicely thirst quenching, though not as smooth as some other examples. The malt is definitely there, but is light and subdued. This pilsener is definitely showcasing the hops, but at the same time it is quite balanced. Light bodied with a perfect finish, this is a great session beer and one of America's finest examples of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Smell: Quite hoppy with grassy aromas.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Very crisp. The hops are there up front and in the back. Not overpowering at all though. Quite delicious. A good balance of bitterness to me.  Drinkability: Well, the easiest way to put this is that this is my 5th one tonight. I would pull the trigger on the 6th but I wanna save it to savor at a later date. Good beer. Very enjoyable. I'll definitely pick this one up again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Medium to light body with perfect carbonation gives it a mouthfeel typical of the style with some roughness provided by the strong dose of hops. Nice crisp finish.  Some spicy malts and yeast help to balance out the tastes of citrus/herbal hops.  Feels a little out of place drinking this in a snowstorm, but this will make a great refreshing summer drink.

I know some people get their knickers in a knot over this statement, but for me, this is a great summer time brew. I'm a hop head who also loves a big stout, but not so much on the warmer days.

It's great to finally get an offering from Victory here and one of a poorly beer style here in Ontario.  Golden with an ever so slight opaque haze to it, I'm excited already. A bleached white head froths forth in all its rocky glory crowning the golden elixir beneath. Minimal lace traces the glass as the magnificent retention of the head is reinforced by the beers suitable carbonation.  Zesty lemon aromas with a tinge of sulfur dissipate from the foamy froth tickling the nasal passage. Sweet rose honey and artisanal white bread give balance and backing to the hoppy bouquet. The floral hop aromas abound, fruit blossoms and young spruce buds, just wonderful. Everything is very clean and concise.  Bitter chestnut honey puckers the tongue leading to a grassy herbal hop character. Crisp pilsner malt provides perfect contrast to the bitterness, also providing body. In the finish hops are king again, a resinous lemon zest finish lingering long in the back of the palate. The flavours are not complex but well balanced and crisp. Refreshing with a light thickness no doubt attributed to the high hop content, it coats the mouth nicely while still managing a excellent thirst quenching nature.  What an outstanding beer fits the style to a T.

The one finger head dissipates quite quickly. Minimal lacing.  Nose: The aroma is nice, but seems a little weak in the Saaz hop area. It's a strong, spicy, even earthy aroma, but not as good as I'd expect.  Tongue: A lot more complex here, but just a bit short of the perfect Pilsner. Quite piney, and most certainly has that ""noble"" hop character, tasty overall, with a very high level of bitterness.  Mouth: A good clean, crisp feel. Refreshing for sure.  Libation: Very drinkable and tasty. This is a very good pilsner, but not the top of the food chain. In my opinion the flavor falls a shade short while delivering a shade too much bitterness, but these are small nit-picks.

This beer pours a slightly hazy medium straw colour, with one finger of creamy white head, which leaves some spotty lace around the glass in its wake. It smells of floral citrus hops, and biscuity white grain. The taste is crisp barley grain, and floral, piney, and grassy hops. The carbonation is average, the body decently round, and full, but a bit clammy, and it finishes clean and crisp.

345,1010,DrDoitchbig,4.18,"Appearance: Poured a crystal clear, extremely light straw yellow. If it wasn't for the tight, bone white two and a half finger head I may have mistaken this as an adjunct lager. Some minor lacing is left behind before the head all but disappears.  Smell: The aroma is a bit weak here. I am picking up on some floral, spicy hops. I just wish they came through stronger. Perhaps I've been spoiled by IPAs in this regard.  Taste: Now this is what I'm talking about. The vague smells from the aroma explode here. I was not expecting this at all. This no question has IPA levels of hops. The flavors come through as in the smell. This is dominated by crisp floral and spicy hops. Nice and bitter, extremely refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Low to medium bodied, but that's to be expected from the style. Fairly high carbonation, but it doesn't detract from anything. As mentioned in the taste it's very crisp and also slightly drying on the finish.  Drinkability: I finished my glass so fast I think my review may have ended up a bit less detailed than I would have liked. This stuff is tasty. I wish I would have bought more than one bottle, because I'm ready for another.  Overall I honestly didn't know what I was getting into with this pils. Having grown up in the good old US of A it's hard to shake the bastardized image of an american adjunct lager being a pilsener. But I think Prima Pils has got the message across.

Smell - A slight tang dances with the spices and herbs. An inviting aroma.  Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is clean with a soft cream-like feel; creamier than Sam.  Taste - The hops start things off but then give way to the herbal qualities of the beer. An almost Wit-like back end to the taste.  Drinkability - The is a sessionable beer.  A solid pilsner.

345,1010,Reaper16,4.15,"12oz. bottle (best by May 2010) served into a Sierra Nevada nucleation pint glass  Pours a pristine, crystal-clear shade of yellow that is most accurately (but not most beautifully) described as similar to urine. Really, there is no difference between the color and translucence of human piss and this beer. But it is all about context, and sitting in the glass this beer is very nice looking, especially with the two fingers of white head sitting on top. The head is composed of tight little bubbles that don't cling to the glass very well. What lacing there is happens to be spotty and soapy.  Prima Pils has an outstanding aroma profile for the style. I immediately get lured in by the hops. They are bitter smelling in a medicinal way, with spritzes of lemon peel and basil, maybe thyme, livening things up. Getting past the hops you can smell the purity of the pilsner malt. It smells singularly doughy and sweet.  On the tongue, the flavors don't quite live up to the promise of the aroma. The hop flavors are less distinguished on the tongue; a bit of a muddled medicinal bitterness. Disappointingly, the lemon isn't as prevalent. The soapy tastes of the hop profile do provide solid support for the clean, airy pilsner malt. The inherent bready flavor isn't allowed to be perceived as one-note. This is a damn nice session candidate.  I am iffy on the mouthfeel. On the one hand, its light body is great for the flavor profile. On the other hand, the carbonation is not nearly active enough on the tongue. I'm not sure why that is; I hope that it isn't an unintended consequence of having the beer shipped to me. Regardless, this beer is a prima candidate for a session. You can happily spend the entire Super Bowl on Sunday, say, with a six pack of this pilsner.  Best American pilsner? Maybe.

Pours a bright glowing yellow with a thick ring of white head and several dots of lacing on the shaker glass. Rich nose imparts bready and sweet pilsner malt, fresh cookie dough, barley, and a bit of lime. Fragrant and inviting. Taste is lemony and citric hops upfront, flowery, herbal and grassy flavours clash with honey and white cracker mid-palate, big Noble hop bitterness kicks in with some herbs and sweetness in the aftertaste. Super refreshing. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, medium-bodied, lightly bitter dryness to finish. A thirst quencher no doubt.

345,1010,Pahn,4.1,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Decently aggressive pour yields a 1/3 inch head that sticks around longer than expected. Pours semi-opaque yellow.  Smell: Grassy, herbal hops and some lemon. A faint breadiness and sweetness emerge as the beer warms. Aroma stays bright and inviting for the entirety of the bottle.  Taste: Grassy and creamy up front, followed by a building soapiness/bitterness that turns into a bready finish. Interesting how the strong herbal character gets overwhelmed by soapiness that transforms into a rye bread-like malt flavor. Good balance. Lots of flavor in those few moments before the bitterness sets in. As I get through the bottle, the distinct hop and malt characters don't get dulled as they do in some other lighter beers I've had in the past.  Mouthfeel: Light- to medium-bodied but still creamy. Well-carbonated without being overwhelming.  Drinkability: Good flavor, refreshing, no noticeable alcohol, and a balance of subtle and aggressive flavors that remain expertly balanced.  Definitely an impressive beer; easily comparable to or better than Pilsner Urquell. This isn't really my style of beer, so I don't think I'll return to it that often, but it's both excellent when evaluated to style and solidly good even if it's not your preferred style.

More hops than a normal pils, but not by a whole lot.  Mouthfeel- Light body, medium carbonation.  Drinkability- Easily a session beer.

345,1010,Mistofminn,4.28,"Pours a straw yellow with about two fingers of frothy white head. Retention isn't the greatest, but it does manage to leave some lacing behind. A very lively carbonation is fueling the foam.  The nose starts out with floral and herbal hops, almost spicey. Biscuity malts are there to back it up, giving it a sweet character. Subtle, for sure, but dang good too.  Like the nose, the taste is dominated by herbal and floral hops, with a solid biscuity malt backbone there to balance it out. Spicey hops dry the palate while the malt sweetens things up a bit. Excellent balance.  Medium to light in body, with a crisp carbonation. Light lingering bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is excellent. Be careful, it is too easy to drink multiple of these without realizing it.  Good pilsners are harder to come by than one might think.

345,1010,TheJollyHop,4.18,"A good pils is hard to find, but luckily Victory has created a brew that has enough body and flavor to stand on its own, and isn't so substantial as to detract or interfere with a good sandwich.  The pils is pale straw in color and the pour created roughly an inch worth of fluffy head. Comprised of rather large bubbles, coupled with the vessel being a shaker pint, the head, not surprisingly, fades rather fast. However some scattered lace is left behind, all the while a flurry of bubbles ascend from the bottom of the glass.  The nose is rather subtle with faint scents of herbal hops and bready malt. Very faint yeast notes as well. Very light and indicative of a refreshing beverage rather than that of a substantial meal.  The bitterness profile really shines in the taste and accentuates the crispness of the beer. Mellow herbal hop flavor with some subtle bread malt and a nice, dry finish that lingers faintly after the swallow. Some lemon and grain flavor is noticeable as well. Slightly astringent but not in a bad way. Definitely not a watered down beer for sure.  The body is rather light, as to be expected, with low to medium carbonation, however the weight feels great on the tongue.  As far as drinkability is concerned, I split a six pack and if there was one more left I would have drunk it!

Smells are very nice pilsner yeast, bread, herbal grain, anise and butterscotch. Very complex and full, a bit like a baby brother version of a Belgian golden ale.  Taste is tangy, slightly bitter, pine, and citrus. The bread and yeast are greatly subdued. Aftertaste is bitter lemon-peel.  Mouthfeel is crisp, light and very dry with good carbonation.  Drinkability is good but not stunning. I think it is just a bit over-dry and not intriguing enough to compensate. - I totally disagree, this beer is awesome and I could drink it into infinity.  I rather like this beer. The nose is really deep for the style. Taste is quite good, if a bit bitter and slightly flat. Mouthfeel is a bit over dry for the drinkability to be stunning, but as a pilsner it is quite drinkable anyway.  As a final note I recently tried the new Sam Adams Noble Pils...

The scent is very lemony with a mix of sweet-smelling bready malt and touch of wheaty, yeasty note. The flavor is very clean, not so hoppy but the lemon zest is retained well. A smooth sweet malt profile with a light but balanced flavor. Abit of tang and spice at the end, leaving a drier bready aftertaste.

The taste starts of in a malty sweet undertone but finished with some bitterness from the hops. Just like the smell there is a nice flavor combination that makes this a very drinkable session beer. Overall a nice easy drinking beer that takes little trouble to polish off a six pack. I first had this as a tailgating beer in the fall and decided to have this again. A very easy drinking quality beer. I will definately be getting this again.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jzeilinger,4.05,"Pours a clear, straw yellow color with tons of active carbonation. Nice creamy white head that sticks nicely to the glass.  Smells of astringent, spicey, floral hops with light bread. Tastes grainy, florally crisp, spicey, and an all out bitterness attack. Expresses a little grassiness and has a little bit of bready malt underneath.  Is prickly on the tongue, very crisp, and finishes extremely dry with a hop bitterness that lingers, and lingers, and lingers... This is a very drinkable beer and one you could have several of in one sitting, especially on a hot summer day. This is what I would consider a little more extreme version of a pilsner and it's quite good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,boatshoes,4.13,"Brought over to the apartment recently by my buddy CharlatanSin. Having gone to college in Philly, it isn't the first time I've had this one but figured it'd be a good time to give it a review.  Appearance- Pours a brilliant golden straw color into my pint glass with a puffy three fingers of white head. Lots of sparkling carbonation, great head retention, and a solid amount of lacing left as I drink. Quite a looker.  Smell- Very hop-oriented pilsner with lots of grapefruit and fruity citrus coming through on the nose. A touch of hay and a little bit of bread coming through as well.  Taste- Again, a very hoppy pilsner. A good punch of fruity, juicy hops initially. This is followed up with a pleasant grassiness and some hay. The malt shows through as well in touch of fresh bread and a tad bit of sweetness.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is well carbonated, light, and dry. Very appetizing and drinkability is extremely high on this one with lots of thirst quenching qualities.  Overall, a great American pilsner. Hoppy for sure but in a great way. A classic and a worthy example as to why pilsner is often an underrated style. If you haven't had it, do so.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,nickd717,4.32,"12oz bottle from K&L Redwood City. Should have reviewed this earlier, but oh well. This beer is an old buddy of mine from my real home state that I will happily go back to anytime I get tired of -bal aged imperial stouts, sours, imperial IPAs, strong Belgian stuff, etc (which is pretty much never, but oh well, it sounds good in theory, doesn't it?).  Pours golden-yellow color with a slightly fizzy white head that dissipates, as it should for this style in my (not BJCP certified) opinion.  Grassy aroma with nice sweet malt. Nice and hoppy for the style, but not overly so to the point where the ""to style"" purists will crap on it.  Flavor is pale, grainy malt with just a touch of sweetness, some honey notes, and a great grassy and herbal hop profile.  Light, crisp, dry, and hoppy on the palate. Somewhat fizzy carbonation, as I have always thought a pilsner should have.  Extremely drinkable. This is a great session beer. * Tomato bombardment from hardcore ""session beer &lt; 4% ABV"" fanatics.* A very nice example of a style that, quite frankly, isn't one of my favorites.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Smell: Nice hop spiciness comes out in the nose. A little bit of biscuit-like malt with some subtle herby flavors.  Taste: Starts out quite mellow. A little light, sweetish kind of pleasant bready malt, then followed immediately by zesty spice. Finishes out bitter with a lingering and surprisingly strong bitter aftertaste. It's nice though, it helps to cleanse the palate for the next eager sip.  Mouthfeel: bright and bubbly but not too harsh. Just enough pop to really complement and bring out the spicier side of the brew.  Drinkability: Very pleasant beer with a lot more assertive flavor than I was expected (it was welcome).

Understated grace.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Note: my bottle was past the best by date by 7 months, so it's possible/probable that this would have been even better if it were fresher.  Has a nice citrusy nose. Small but nice rim of head. Mildly cloudy (unfiltered) looking. Smells obviously like a Pilsener but with more pizazz than usual. ""Mmmm...mmm"" were my first comments. This is very nice and refreshing and certainly not boring. Nice amount of hops but not overpowering. I like this quite a bit, usually this style is terribly boring to me, this is definitely not. In general the taste is very light with a mild citrus. Noticed an interesting earthy flavor in the finish for a minute which was kind of nice. I'd be very happy drinking this beer on a hot summer day. I believe this is definitely the best Pilsener I've ever had.  Just a side note, this is an excellent pilsener but in general I prefer Stouts, Porters, Barleywines, etc. which I find to be much tastier and more my style, so while this is one of the best Pilseners I have had this is nowhere near my favorite beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Some pine needles in here as well  M - Medium bodied, nice carbonation. Dry in the finish.  D - Very crisp and refreshing, like a good pils should be.

Some bitterness builds mid-stream, but I would call this a malt forward beer. Finishes with a strong bready pilsner malt flavor.  M - Strong carbonation bite. Full bodied beer. Leaves behind a light oily texture.  D - Very drinkable beer. ABV is manageable. Flavors aren't overwhelming. Not filling.

345,1010,JohnnyBarman,4.35,"Gotta love the singles selection at the LCBO. Been meaning to try this, but the 6 pack is fairly pricey so I've been hesitant.  Pours a light golden hue, slightly opaque. I initially thought that the beer had gone south, but other reviewers have noticed the same effect so it's all good. One inch of fluffy head, dissolves into a thin layer. Lots of sticky lacing, good retention.  I have a bit of a headcold (hence drinking), so my nasal capacity is a bit compromised. No matter, because the nose is quite strong and detectable even in my sad condition. Very hoppy, with lemon and other citrus coming through. A bit of bread too.  Wow, this is one hoppy pilsner, but man is it good. The hops come through a bit later, as it starts off a bit sweet (honey), but then the bitterness takes over. Very crisp and refreshing, with lemon and rich, juicy hoppiness.  About right mouthfeel for a pilsner, well-carbonated. The bitterness sticks around on the tongue for a minute, but doesn't overstay its welcome.  One of the finest pilsners I've had in years, which is saying something because generally I find pilsners to be rather uninteresting brews. This one certainly inspired me. I'll definitely be back for a sixpack in warmer weather. A great patio brew, I'm sure.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Lacing is wonderful and just sticks around forever. It's about 5 minutes after my first couple sips and it is just stuck to the glass. Hasn't even slid down an inch.  S - Very fragrant. As soon as I poured it I was hit with a lot of citrus. (Grapefruit and Lemon) Also some honey.  T - Grassy malt is the first taste. Leans a bit more in the sweet department rather than bitter in my opinion. The flavor from the hops actually has way more bite than you would think from the smell. Definitely didn't think it would taste this way at all. Really hoppy for a Pilsener. After the original hops taste begins to subside I found myself left with a lemon taste. A lingering grain taste sticks around for a decent amount of time after a taste.  M -Medium-bodied. In my experiences with pilseners this seems to be a bit more bodied. Very well carbonated but not to the point it's bad.  D - Very refreshing, and crisp.

Aroma is pleasant - a bit citrusy and grainy. I have to confess - I didn't notice the hops in the aroma, but boy, I sure noticed them in the taste. The immediate blast of hops was a big surprise, but a pleasurable one. They're not overwhelming, but definitely a surprise for the style. Behind the hops there's the zesty citrus and malt. You get the bitter, and then you get the sweet. Makes for a very crisp and refreshing taste. There's also that bit of a ""chemical"" taste that I tend to get in pilseners - almost like cleaning fluid. Mouthfeel is nearly spot on for the style - thin body and generous carbonation.

I am starting to get excited about trying this beer  The hops are definately evident from the first sip. Slightly sweet, mildly bitter, maybe a hint of grassyness. A little weak on the malt presence. Very refreshing, crisp, I am pleasantly surprised.  Light, crisp, a slight tingle of carbination on the tounge. This has the right mixture of flavors and is easy enough to drink that it keeps me coming back for more. I would like to see a slightly larger malt profile, as there is just the slightest hint of bready malts. Just a little too hoppy for me to consider it a traditional example of the style, it seems like alot of American breweries tend to over hop thier pilsners.

After paying $9.50 for a 6 pack I thought that this had better be damn good for this price, wrong. Although a decent beer it is far over priced and over scored by other reviewers. Prima Pils was far to carbonated, its carbonation was that of Busch Light which does not boast flavor only drinkability. For the style it has too much hops. To me it tasted very similar to Summit Pisener where you can get 12 for this price. All in all not that bad but why people rate it so high for this style??

My first real pilsener (aside from Miller Lite's claim to fame), this is pretty impressive. Plenty of citrusy and floral hops up front balanced out by some paler malts, all balanced awesomely on a backbone of crisp, dry, smooth body.

Notes of passionfruit, resin and sweet citrus, with a really pleasant, but very underplayed grain sweetness. It's clean and fresh and more pointed than, say, the hop explosion you'd get from an IPA, but it's bang on for this style.  Taste is also clean and fresh, with a nice sharp and direct vector of hop bitterness through the mid palate. Finish is extremely dry, which is just what you want, leaving a refreshing bite of underripe carambola or kiwifruit.

345,1010,sgoodship,4.15,"I've been enjoying the Hop Devil so much that I wanted to try more Victory Brews. I have always heard great things about this pils.  This beer looks so refreshing. In a pils glass, it was light lager color with a slight haze that I wasn't expecting. The head was big and craggy and the lacing was good.  The nose is a lager aggressiveness with a good amount of underlying malt. There may be a hint of banana there. This pils has a hint of fruit (maybe some sweet pear). It's got malt breadiness coming thorugh but quickly falls into a sharp pils bite. The end becomes more malty again and that leads to a dry bitterness.  Light body that was fuller than expected with a heavy carbonation.  It feels like this beer could have been crisper in the finish but generally I really enjoyed it. It makes me want to spend more time with non IPA brews. It's worth dropping my addiction to enjoy a wider range of beers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

AROMA: Pilsner like herbs/spice also citrus with a hint of Belgian like spice (coriander). FLAVOR: IPA Citrus flavor and pilsner like herbs/spice. I actually think this tastes more like a funky IPA then a German Pilsner. Not a bad thing just hard to catorgorize. MOUTHFEEL: Medium body with crisp mouthfeel. Lively carbonation.

The lacing doesn't cover the insides of the glass, but it does clump together in large chunks, rather.  My nose picks up zesty citrus hops with a slight hint of pilsner(duh) malt. Initial tast is very zesty citrus hops that rolls off bitter at the end. As it warms up, the light toasted barley reintroduces itself as the hops start to mellow out a bit.  Very refreshing; crisp and dry. Medium bodied beer; carbonation is just perfect. This is my go to beer when i want a light taste of citrus hops when I want something a little more subtle than APAs.

345,1010,Daniellobo,3.88,"An intensely hopped US pilsner. Crispy, refreshing and with a bite. A nice nod and defiance to the style.  Presentation: 12 oz bottle. Simple and somewhat pop design around a green color palette and an image of dominant hops with subdued grain in the background. Short narrative on the side, noting the name their history behind the brew and briefly the ingredients. Notes beer freshness drinking by date (Semi-erased blur and the year 2010) but lacks any other info. Poured into a tall pilsner glass.  A - Pale straw and faintly hazy color with a generous head, that fades leaving great lacing.  S - Very fresh and hoppy aroma, first hint of citrus and grassy bitterness.  T - Hoppy bitterness with a citrus range and a soft malt base.  M - Light bodied with generous carbonation, and a smooth bite.  D - A very drinkable brew that makes a truly attractive pilsner.  Notes: Not being a big fan of the style and noting that I like it quite a bit, this may not be for most pilsner lovers, at least those that may not be very open to the assertive hoppy profile. In that sense something more subdued like the Brooklyn version might be a better transition to craft brews, although this is by far the more attractive brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Poured a light golden color into my St. Louis pilsner glass. Nice finger and a half of bubbly white head. Plenty of lace in the head that stuck around throughout the drink.  Can definitely make out the Euro hops in the smell. Grassy, grainy with a hint of citrus.  This has to be the best tasting Pilsener I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. Hoppier than any other I've tasted, but in a very good way. Taste transitions from the bitterness of the hops to a fruity, spicy finish.  Mouth feel is light body, crisp and refreshing.

345,1010,BierFan,3.27,Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass.  Big off-white head. Hazy yellow. Weird that a pilsner would be hazy. Looks like a witbier. Grassy and flowery aroma. Apparently this beer has been infected with brettanomyces. Definitely has a bit of a sour twang. Not really like a pilsner at all.

T - Initially very hop forward, pleasant bitterness and hop flavor but also very well balanced with pils malt sweetness. Very niice.  M - light, not quite medium bodied, smooth and very drinkable.

345,1010,t8000shx,4.48,"Poured from the bottle to a 16oz tumbler, at appropriate serving temp for a pils.  Appearance - Looks like a glass of honey. To test this, I poured some honey into a shot glass. The beer genuinely looks like a glass of honey, just a touch more pale. Just what a pilsner should look like.  Smell - Honey (it was actually the aroma that inspired me to bust out my Honey Bear). Not much of a hint at the hops in the flavor profile, interestingly. A little grassiness, barnyard smell, but only slightly.  Taste - Some good hops and mild malty sweetness hit quickly, but don't hang out long. They give way to a dry, crisp middle and finish with some residual bitterness from the hops closing down the party, lingering longer than I'd expect. Finally, after I thought the night was over, I noticed some minerally after taste on the back of my palette. It's ok, feel free to hang around. I liked it.  Mouthfeel - The perfect weight for the style. Not in the least bit sticky or chewy, lively small-bubbled carbonation, slides across the tongue and sneaks down your throat, which leads us to...  Drinkability - Get out of town. Get right the F out of town. On a summer day, hell, on a fall morning at 2:30am, such as right now, I could probably toss back a good half dozen of these bad boys. It's one of my very top session beers. Won't fill you up, never let's you down... or something along those lines. Great flavor, great thirst quenching, reasonable price, excellent accessibility.

345,1010,Cadyfatcat,3.32,"The high level of hop flavor and bittering in this beer is uncharacteristic of a German pilsner. If anything I would say it is like a normal IPA (not any double IPA or anything like that mind you) in terms of hop characteristics, but with the body and malt profile of a pilsner.  This is a great concept - many times, often in the summer, I will be swilling down a cool, crisp, and drinkable pilsner, but yearn for something more with which my taste buds can play. Yes the concept is spot on for me, but the execution is a little bit off. This beer leaves an unpleasant bitterness in the mouth due to the weak malt profile holding up such a strong hop character. This is not conducive to drinking more than one or two at a time; pilsner's can be drunk by the gallon. I think the hops should be toned down a little and perhaps weighted more in the aromatic/flavor department rather than bittering.  I am being very critical - yes, but this is a good beer, and an interesting one for it's foray into previously uncharted territory for a pilsner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Fruitiness comes through the most... lemon, apples, and others.  T: An extremely refreshing, fruity taste that finishes with a nice, crisp bitterness. Just awesome.

Interesting, this looks good. A quickly dissipating head gives way to nice lacing.  S - A nice, piney/lemon hop scent, with a grainy, caramel malt background. This reminds me more of an American pale ale than a pilsner, but very enjoyable nonetheless.  T - Not what I was expecting for a pilsner, but it is good, and very refreshing. A malty forefront is quickly greeted with assertive hops (for this style of beer anyway). Bitter, dry aftertaste leaves you wanting more. This reminds me more like an APA in taste.  M - A bit on the medium bodied side for this style. Not that that's a bad thing though! This is a lager with some more depth and character.  D - Highly sessionable. Each sip leaves you wanting more, and it's quite refreshing. A great choice for summer drinking.  Overall - A very American take on the European Pilsner style, at least to me.

Bold for the style, and quite pleasant.  Taste is a bit more grainy and earthy that the nose would have indicated. I'm not able to pick out the particular styles of hops, but definitely recognize them as being German. Very grassy and herbal, some faint clove-like flavors still present, very subtle but flavorful.  The mouthfeel is quite good for the style. The carbonation levels are high but they are so soft it actually makes the beer feel nearly full bodied, even though it is probably much closer to medium-light.

Smell: A perfume of German malt that is pale and sugary sweet. Mild hop aroma displays lemon, grass and orange. Subtle biscuit aroma underlies.  Taste: A smooth, sensual flavor profile consists of those great German pale malts and a balancing bitter aftertaste. Biscuits, bread, lemon, orange and shortbread all make a buttery flavor profile.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth to quaff and bitter resins dry out the finish to make you go back for more. This is about as pleasant as a beer can be in the mouth and throat.

I prefer a nice balance in most styles, so bear that in mind as you read on. Taste also is dominated by hops, to me, almost to the point of distraction. Hop fans will probably enjoy this, but it left me wishing for a stronger malt presence to even things out. That said, this beer showed classic hops spiciness/bitterness that some others would probably quite enjoy. Good, smooth mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation for a decent level of drinkability. While I certainly didn't dislike this beer, IMHO, it lacks the balance to be a top representative of the style, in fact, reminding me somewhat of an IPA&gt; That said, those with more of a fondness for hops would probably enjoy this beer immensely, and I think this conclusion is certainly borne out by several other reviewers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Pretty much on the nose as far as the style goes for taste. Grassy lager and grain flavors with an ample dosing of european hops. A good dryness on the finish and spicy hops linger on in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is ideal. Slightly high carbonation is perfect, but this one is just a tiny tad more viscous than i would like.  Drinkability is top notch. Abv doesn't play any factor at all, and the extra hops in this one make me want to slam it all day.

S- As far as a pilsner goes, this is the best so far. It has a fair amount of noble hop character to the nose. Its has a slight pine smell then a good spicey hop finish. There is a pilsner malt backbone behind the smell.  T- There is a very good hop presence up front, quite tasty once the sweet pilsner malt takes over. Then there is just enough bittering hops on the back end to have a very good dry finish.  M- Light body, lots of carbonation.  O- This is an awesome pilsner. The Hops are not overwhelming by any means to the pilsner malt. Very pleasing taste. Will by again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,MunchkinDrinker,3.7,"A - Slightly cloudy straw yellow with a fizzy head. Bubbles away to leave some lacing.  S - Bitter floral and lemony aroma. Nice aroma, some latent lagerish yeast/malt on the back.  T/M - This is where it loses me. There is a huge grassy lemon-rind punch that fades into a very light malt background. Just really unbalanced to me. Great hop flavor, but there is absolutely nothing behind it. Maybe it's the style, but I just can't find anything to balance out the hops. Mouthfeel is nice, juicy and not sticky.  D - Low alcohol, but the bitterness builds on you.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,EatsTacos,4.35,"Pours a pale straw yellow, clear, with a moussy thick head. Good lacing  The nose is restrained, grassy, hoppy, citrusy, and some light spices.  The flavour of this beer is really where it shines. The hops are spicey and dry, not a lot of the citrus or grapefruit that I'm used to from so many IPAs. The malt is balanced well and the overall impression is a great balance.  Good body to this beer, and the carbonation is sharp. The drinkability is very high for myself",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,lstokes,4.38,"Best pilsner out there? I don't like pilsners as a rule (they're like IPAs with muzzles!) but this made me understand the style.  Golden with a fluffy full head, nose of soft citrus hops and a bit of grass. The taste is pretty awesome--medium body and carbonation supporting bold lemon and spiced floral hops and a full malt profile. Finishes with a nice bitter zing, very sessionable.  Victory blows by the competition once again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,rfgetz,4,"Pours a golden yellow color with cap of dense white froth, decent retention and minimal lacing. Scent is clean and fresh with notes of grassy, lightly lemony, faintly spicy hops blended with fresh dried grainy pils malts. Taste follows suit, highly hopped for the style, but those notes don't interfere with the fact this is a very solid pilsner. Medium bodied, fairly full for the style, lightly buttery on the palate, finishes dry. One of the best American pilsners out there.  Note: Recently revisited for a formal review after many casual samplings. My palate has advanced where I can appreciate the subtle notes a bit more. Other pilsners like Sam Adams Noble Pils have out hopped this beer, but this is still fantastic. Score adjusted upwards accordingly.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,MaxBrews,4.23,"Presentation 12 oz bottle poured into a fluted pilsner.  Appearance: Pours with a 3 finger width fluffy white-head. Clear golden yellow in color. Appears not to be overly carbonated. Lacing clings to the glass.  Smell: Hoppy with a herbal & citrusy-lemon zest. You might even say a blend of every citrus fruit. If you can get past the hops you may smell a very pale malt.  Taste: Brings forth the citrusy hops on the first sip and follows through on sips after with a fine blend of pale malt and citrus fruit. A really herbal and citrus blend of hops. Fantastic hoppy after taste  Mouthfeel: Less carbonated then you would expect. Most of the dryness comes from the hops. Does have a higher hop bitterness. But overall a crisp clean brew.  Drinkability: I'm no pils expert. Infact I'm lager-phobic, but this one had more flavor then I would ever expect. Its a bit like an american pale ale but with that lager crispness. Can't say if this is dead on for the style but, a clean hoppy brew for when you get tired of those Pale ales. Because its so clean and hoppy this is a super sessionable beer. Your mouth may end up a bit dry but you'll love every bit of it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,mikel52588,3.37,"Appearance: Light yellowish gold, 2 finger head  Smell: almost lemony citrus, its also pretty sweet, but its kind of faint  Taste: it has a soft bitterness followed by your creamier citrus with some floral qualities  Mouthfeel: its light, still softly bitter, not too bad of an aftertaste. After a while you kinda get the aftertaste of cheddar cheese in your mouth (not necessarily a bad thing)  Drinkability: Not much to say about this, its light, citrusy, and bitter, if you're a fan of those qualities you'll be all over this one. I like beers that have a little more malty flavor which this doesn't provide, but its not bad. It'd be good with a lighter but spicy meal and maybe cheddar cheese.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,craftaholic,3.62,"Appearance: Pale bright gold with a thin white head that leaves behind a few rings.  Smell: Some grain with a hint of honey and lemony citrus that binds it all together.  Taste: Lightly toasted hops, somewhat grassy, basically an American version of Pilsner Urquell. Has some sweetness but is bombarded by the grassy grains and hops off the bat. The aroma is on par with the scent, nothing that creeps up and everything's spelled out.  Mouthfeel: Crisp medium bodied brew with a smooth start and a bitter finish  Drinkability: Could session no doubt about it  Overall: A lighter brew from victory not my favorite by them as a whole but in the pilsner class its a-ok.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ThatWineGuy,3.88,"Newly available in Ontario. Yellow, white half finger head. Moderate carbonation, medium large bubbles, some ribbon lace. Smell of fresh cut grass, soda biscuits. Taste is bitter at the outset, malty middle, tea biscuit dry finish is a bit tart with earthy tones lingering. Quenching mouthfeel, malt presence felt. Satisfying, refreshing yet substantial. Everything you expect in a lager and more, I would pick this up again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,pmccallum86,4.22,"Pours a yellow golden color with a slight hazy appearance. Medium sized head which dissipates quickly, lots of lacing with great retention.  The smell is of citrus floral hops with a bread malt note as well.  Great taste, probably the best pilsener I have had to date, yummy. Floral hop taste with a small malt presence in the finish.  Higher carbonation and a thin smooth mouthfeel, very nice and refreshing.  This is quite a drinkable beer, very well done pilsener.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,organicbrewer,4.88,"A-Perfectly gold. Huge cloud like head. lots of bubbles coming up through the liquid  S- Crackers. Earthy hops. Slight Citrus. Very nice  T-Firmly bitter but not over the top, just assertive. More earthy hops. Light crackery malt.  M- Fairly dry, which is good for style. medium-high carbonation. Bitterness leaves you ready for another drink.  D-Great version of a pils. Seems more like a bo pils than a N. German, but who am I to argue. This is what american lagers should taste like!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,StJamesGate,4.17,"Pours palest bright gold with a thin tight white head that fades fast but rings. Big lemon sorbet and nettle nose. Stingy twig and cinnamon malts, hit of sour citrus, then tight spice on the finish. Tart and complex linger - hops last forever! Light feel but pretty sticky.  Probably the best hop finish I've had in an American take on pilsener.  2nd tasting: Hazy lemon with clingy white froth that rings, a big lemon rind nose (you could tell me it's Citra and I might believe it), gentle crackery pale malt and grassy, leafy, slightly anise hops that linger forever.  My go to beer when I can't peruse a list.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Misfit138,3.85,"Poured into pint glass from bottle  A- Bright yellow with a generous two in head  S- Mostly grain and honey followed by citrus hops  T- initially pretty smooth and maybe a little sweet which gives way to a bold citrus bitterness you will notice.  M- Medium bodied with fair carbonation.  D- I must say I am impressed with this. I wasn't all that excited about it since they style is similar to a mass produced domestic lager, but it really has good flavor. Maybe has more flavor than Sam Adams Boston Lager. I believe I will buy this again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,dismal,3.68,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clear pale yellow color with a one finger white head. The head slowly goes down but sticks around and leaves some lacing down the glass. Smell is almost kind of grassy, don't know what else to say as I can pick up some other smells but nothing really sticks out. Taste has a bit of a lemon or zesty hint. Like the smell I'm not completely sure what else is there. It's not really bitter but it isn't too sweet either. Goes down pretty easily though. I've only had a few Pillseners before and I think it really isn't my style. I can drink it though I just don't dig it. I'm not going to rate it down because of it though. Overall it isn't bad, this one is better than some of the other Pilsners I've tried.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,washburnkid,4.35,"A little over a finger of white froth over a relatively clear light golden. Good sticky rounds of lace on the glass and a thin cap of head retains. There's a huge hop aroma out of the pour. Fresh cut grass and a bit perfumey. It's really clean on the nose. Flavors are the same. This is a really straightforward and delicious pils. Fresh cut grass, and a grainy characteristic from the malt. No steel or skunked flavors, which is nice! Crisp and medium body. I appreciate not drinking a watery pils. There's some bready malt, honey, and even lemon citrus. I'd have many of these in one sitting.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,bret27,4.07,"Smell: Clean light soft hops, malts.  Appearance: Pale gold, very clear, good white head in pilsener glass.  Taste: This is the pleasant surprise. Caramel and honey at the start but quickly followed by a hoppy bite from middle to end.  Aftertaste/mouthfeel: Full malt and hops from start to finish. Bitter hops lingering well after the finish. Finishes like a well-made pale ale. Very refreshing and drinkable.  Overall: Very nice. Fuller mouth and hoppier than most classic pilseners, but that's a good thing. Whether they're hop deviling or hop walloping, Victory knows how to use their hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,vikingmike,4.85,"This is the best Pilsner I have ever had, bar none.  Beautiful golden colour. Aroma of floral, spicy hops. Elegantly simple taste with lingering hop bitterness.

345,1010,jbro434,4.7,"Bright gold with just a bit of head. A small amount of lacing appears with each sip. And sip I did. One glorious sip after another. Clean and full of hops. There was great joy in finding that classic pilsner taste that I love after cracking this open. The hops are potent, not over the top. The mouthfeel is crisp and tangy, balanced with a nice malt warmth. The finish is a hophead dream. The taste buds tingled with joy, allowing for a nice pause between sips to savor the flavor. Good stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,kingcrowing,4.42,"12oz Bottle in a pilsner glass.  Pours an awesome golden color with no head. Slightly hazy but very nice for a Pilsner. On the nose is light and hoppy, smells awesome for a pilsner.  Taste is amazing. Very smooth and hoppy. Basically it's like a Pilsner Urquell with some extra hops, really a good lager in the age of American Ales. Worth seeking out, and worth keeping a bit colder than most ales.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,number1bum,4.47,"I can't believe I've never reviewed Prima Pils...  Pours a clear straw yellow color, maybe a bit closer to golden actually, with about two fingers of off-white head. Head settles to a thin but full lace and leaves a splash of stick here and there on the sides.  Smells of grassy, spicy hops along with some lemon zest. There's a nice, soft sweetness to the beer as well. Very nice.  Taste is boldly hoppy and very smooth. Hops are grassy and citrusy with the lemon zest that was in the nose, and some noble spice as well. There is a light sweetness that serves the beer well as the hop bitterness is quite aggressive for a pils. Bitterness lasts long into the finish. Some juicy citrus sweetness is also left on the palate. Very smooth and tasty.  Mouthfeel is a crisp medium body, quite smooth yet sharp in the finish with the hop bitterness. Quite refreshing.  This is probably my favorite of the PA pils, although Troegs, Victory and Sly Fox are all outstanding as well. This one just has so much hop flavor that it's hard to beat. A great beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,popery,4.52,"A fantastic pilsener from the United States, an all too rare feat. Prima Pils pours bright yellow with a big white head that leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is fresh grain and strong, sharp, spicy hops. It smells like a wet barley field with a strong whiff of lemon peel shavings and apple slices. The flavor is fairly hoppy for the style, but there's a wonderful malt presence. It's a thirst-quenching beer that doesn't cut corners. The flavors are strong and crisp. This beer doesn't quite measure up to Moonlight's Reality Czech, but I'd bet the contest would be extremely close if I was working with fresh kegs of each. In the interest of science, Moonlight and Victory should each priority ship me fresh kegs.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

T - that's a smack of hops in the mouth! quite bitter and complex. initial taste is an almost sweet hop presence, like tangy apricots; quite interesting. again, as in the nose, the hops prove to be quite dynamic: bitter grapefruit rind, pine, a whole range of flavours. there is a sweetness that sneaks in amongst all the bitter complexities, which makes the taste quite phenomenal and the high point of the initial. the finish is a piney-grapefruit. the afterstaste s a slight citric sweetness, like sweetened canned grapefruit, as with some of the malty sweetness.

This beer is nearly clear, like water, it was impressive, amazing really. I stared at it for a while before drinking it. There is little to moderate carbonation, big head that fell away quickly. Smell is a little skunky, proabably not the best descriptor because the beer was not skunky. I can see why people use this as a good example of a pilsner, but I did not enjoy it. Sweetness classic Pils aroma developed or became more obvious as I drank.

345,1010,eat,4.33,"I reviewed this beer about a year ago and after just trying it again it's hard to believe it's the same beer in the bottle. Somehow I had come up with a 3.25 rating and given the renown of this pils felt like I needed to give it a second chance. I don't know if my palate changed or what, but I enjoyed this beer significantly more this time around.  Bottle at The Magpie while watching some jazz music; traded the bartender for a Half Pints Black Scrapper after hearing him talking about the brewery. Good deal for him but I had no cash on me and got a free beer out of it. Always good to spread the Half Pints love around...one of Winnipeg's only redeeming qualities!  Pours a bright white head with good retention and great lacing. Hazy straw coloured body. Great looking pils.  Smells of noble hops with light malt underneath and a touch of stinky cheese somehow, but not in a bad way. Different.  This has to easily be the best pilsner I've had. Tons of noble hops. Very much an American version of a pils in the amount of hopping here, though the character is all Czech. Quite bitter but very well-balanced. Light malt underneath but the focus is on tons of pilsner hops. Very well done.  Good feel. Slightly viscous medium body with medium-high carbonation. An appropriately lively feel.  Hell yeah. This is great stuff. Extremely drinkable, this is a pilsner I would buy a sixer of to have around, especially for friends who aren't into the more out-there stuff that I enjoy.

345,1010,wl0307,4.07,"Purchased at the BSF Bar, GBBF 2009; BB 04/10/2009, served lightly chilled in a 500ml straight pint glass. NOTE: No indication of alc. strength is provided on the label.  A: pours a very pale straw hue with sporadic streams of medium-size bubbles; the fluffy white foam settles slowly to a thin cap to last. S: clean/fine straw-ish lager malt makes its way into the nostrils first, but the fruity backbone from lightly citric (almost grapefruit-ish) and breezy-floral hop aroma stays staunchly behind; a close sniff would reveal more aromatic citrusness and a clean, sour-doughy note as of a well lager-ed beer, but not quite pronounced as its genuine German counterparts. Overall, refreshing, and very pleasant, thanks to the fulsome fruitiness on the balance. T: the flavour is lightly fruity and immediately bitter from the very beginning, but quickly the bitter grapefruits ensue and leave clean lager malts way... behind; the aftertaste is really chewy, zesty-tannic and bitter, much more so than most (if not ALL) German Pilseners I've tried and, simultaneously, the hop flavour and aroma are both more assertive as well. Sip after sip, the bitterness intensifies and renders a tongue-plucking impact throughout. M&D: moderately carbonated and medium-bodied for the reported strength (5.3%abv.), this lager is in fact more like a well-hopped blond ale - for, the lingering bitterness and chewy palate in the end is more like that of a blond ale, which comes with pronounced hoppiness not usually associated with a German Pilsener, while the typical clean dough-iness is rather suppressed in face of the hop components.

Nose is grassy, a bit floral, touch of crisp grainy malt underneath, a lemony bite alongside, with just a hint of sulfur in there.  Taste is rather aggressively bitter for a pils. Sharp hop bite up front is grassy, spicy, dry, followed by a lightly-sweet, cracker-dry malt note that pokes its head out briefly as it heads into the moderately bitter, spicy finish. Adore the noble hop character in this one, the tongue tingles with spicy bitterness after every sip. Finish is just a bit lemony as well, with a bit of the malt sweetness carrying over way down underneath.

345,1010,Ralphus,4.27,"Prima pils has finally arrived at the LCBO after many months of anticipation. You see, the LCBO shelves are clogged with boring pilsners from every corner of the world, very few of which are any good. When something different comes along that is known to be good people get interested.  Prima looks ok. It's a fairly generic looking pilsner. A light golden colored lager with a small white head that sticks around providing a bit of lacing and a small white cap.  The smell is nice though. Sweet malts with some lovely floral hops greet your nose with every sip. Tastewise this beer has a quite sharp, clean hop presence initially followed by a slow smooth sweet aftertaste. It's just what you need in a pilsner and it gets better as the beer warms up.  Mouthfeel is refreshingly carbonated and this leads to excellent drinkability.

Nice clean and crisp flavor followed up by a nice bittering hop presence. More bite than your typical pilsner, but adds a ton of character and favorable flavor.  Heavier part of light bodied. Very smooth and a slight creamy texture. Not expected from this style.  Great drinkability. This would be a good beer to have on hands at all times.

The hops jump out of this one. Nothing harsh, just delicate grass seed with some faint fruity-grainy notes letting you know that the malt is there. Wonderful.  Taste does not disapoint. A large helping of noble continental hops gives the beer an admirable up-front crispness which is followed by some very drying bittering hops. A very herbal beer with plenty of fresh grass and hop spiciness. Only reason it's not scored 5 is the shyness of the malt, I get very little grain.  Could be a bit chewier, seems awful thin, but that only adds to the awesome drinkability.

345,1010,biegaman,4.24,"Prima Pils reminds me of a brand-new gold plated trumpet. It is brilliantly resplendent and its well-polished glisten is without even the faintest of blemishes; I dare not stain the glass with fingerprints. In contrast, its head is almost unattractively scuzzy and its retention concerningly feeble. Luckily, the orchestra of bubbles entertain with their own concerto of jostling movement and hypnotic rhythm. This definitely belongs in the symphony.  The aroma is of the perfect match for a pilsner- sassy, soapy, spicy, it has all the characteristics of Europe's most popular style beer. And I am speaking of a *real* pilsner, not the bastardized mass-produced yellow lagers that are often labeled 'pils', but rather of the fragrant, fiery variety that is rightfully the pride of every Czech (and German). Successful execution is owed to whole-leaf Saaz and German Northern Brewer hops.  And despite the bottle being three-months old, that lemony, green, grassy pungency of the hops is still hugely discernible in the taste as well. It's almost gritty earthiness is mellowed out by the sweet, lightly grainy taste of bready pale malts. The sweetness of malts and the bitterness of hops is one of nature's true ying and yangs - a testament to the inherent balance of the natural world. It's hard to say what aspect I like better.  Actually no it isn't - I like the hops. And that this pilsner uses a good amount of them makes it wholly gratifying. This style of beer is notorious for disappearing in gulps rather than sips, liters rather than millimeters and Prima Pils' quenching, light bodied mouthfeel, complete with the clipping hop bite, is no exception to the trend. Discounting all this brewery's other notably solid offerings, Victory can rightfully be called such just on the basis of this beer.  Prima Pils being a great pilsner should shock you as much as water being wet. Not only is Pennsylvania renown for making some of the best German-style beers outside of Germany, but Victory is right up there amongst the best of that state's many great breweries. Besides, this brewery makes a whole variety of insanely highly rated pilsners, one of which, Braumeister Harvest Pils, is probably the best example of the style I've ever tried.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Light citrus notes, acacia honey, and lightly pungent hop character work well together.  T - Not boring, as many German-style Pilseners can be to me. Lightly hoppy, with both pungent/bitter notes and sweeter citrusy notes working well together.  M - Light in body, high carbonation, what did you expect? Pretty true to style, I'd say.  D - A very well-crafted and tasty Pilsener. A great option for anyone looking for a cold, crisp brew on a hot day.

Aroma is excellent, with pungent Saaz hops dominating the nose. Really hoppy!  Flavor is also really hoppy, but almost too much so for a pils. I know the malt backbone is there because I feel it, but I need to taste more of it. The pilsners I tend to like the best are a little more biscuity, a little sweeter, but still bitter. A minor quibble however. Mouthfeel is creamy yet light. Extraordinarily drinkable for such a hoppy, flavorful brew.

T- I don't know if I can describe a taste as ""bright"", but that's the first word that comes to mind. I'm getting a little sweetness off of this, fresh cut grass, and a refreshing blast of Hallertau for a dry finish.  M- This beer is very carbonated, but it works. The carbonation compliments the dry and lemony attributes of the hop. Definitely a fuller body than I would normally expect from an American Pilsner.  D- So refreshing and yummy.

345,1010,bobsy,4.33,"A pour of this amazing clarity is something to behold. A bright and shining yellow with a steady stream of bubbles and a rocky white head, prima pils is textbook. Lacing is decent, leaving concentric rings on the glass, and the head never completely dies away. A sweet, grainy and floral aroma mixes in with lemon to produce a clean and enticing introduction. Pale sweet malt leads off the flavour, before the hops make their presence felt with notes of grass, lemon and pepper. A dry, crisp, saaz-dominated finish brings matters to a close. The body detours slightly from the traditional pils model, with its slightly heavier weight, while its high, but soft carbonation cleans the palate.  Previous reports had led me to believe that this was a highly hopped pils, and while it is, the accompanying bitterness never exceeds moderate limits. The lack of balance I feared going in was simply a chimera, and this is a great marriage of hops and malts.

Prima Pils pours a crystal clear golden straw color, with a bright white fizzy soap suds head. I got scared that the head would overflow, but luckily it stopped rising just in time. It fizzled away rapidly to a thin white ring, leaving behind some sticky lace.  The smell is just what I am looking for. Grainy. Mildly sweet. Some faint floral hops. This is what I want a pilsner to smell like.  What a refreshing taste. Good balance between dry graininess with a bitter edge. The dry, biting finish makes this one easy to drink.

A light lemon and earthy blend upon the initial taste, which gives way to bread and pilsner malt in the mid-flavor.

I'm looking for an Old World (read German/Czech) pilsner. While a good, fortifying drink, Prima Pils does not come close to being a true Pilsner. It's more American ale than even a lager, let alone a pilsner.  This beer's potential is most likely in its water, as PA is founded on limestone, like northern Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. However, Prima's yeast does not convince me that this drink is bottom fermented. Nor does the thick yellow color convince me that this is a pilsner: it's too malty; it's too strong.

A 4.0 -&gt; 4.5 S 4.0 -&gt; 4.5 T 3.5 -&gt; 4.0 D 3.5 -&gt; 4.5  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OLD REVIEW 2-8-2008  clear, light straw color. fluffy head fades to a thin layer. moderate lacing.  some typical noble hop aroma, with a hint of lemon zest and pepper.  the bitterness seems to get in the way somewhat of the other characteristics in the brew. it's almost like the bitter part of a citrus rind. not exactly a ""crisp"" bitterness, even in the aftertaste. it really coats the tongue and lingers.  mouthfeel is quite smooth with a lively carbonation.  that clinging bitterness is just a tad too much, imo. cuts down on my wanting to have more than one in a sitting.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Mardukk,4.17,Pours a hazy golden with a small white head that retains well.  Nice hoppy smell.  Piney and grassy hop taste with a small amount of malt to balance.  Medium carbonation with a light to medium body. Just right for a pils.  Quite drinkable with the lower abv and malt to balance out the strong hop taste.  Overall one of the best pils out there. When I'm in the mood for hops and drinkability I pick this up.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,oss68,4.75,Nice gold color with decent carbonation Wonderful earthy hop fragrance; the real payoff is in the taste and mouthfeel: hoppy in an herb-like way with a nice touch of sweet malts. This is not your average pils by a longshot. It's scary how much of this stuff I could drink. Best pils I ever had.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ngandhi,4.47,"Is this the world's best Pilsner? Probably. And thank God. Victory changes the game with this beer, making something so exactly like it should be that no one, save a few old men holed up in their basements in Prague and Anytown, Germany hiding from their wives, otherwise would dare.  Nobody makes lager like this, mellow in malt but as grainy as whole rye toast, mellow in hops but as citrusy as a field of yuzu and Buddha's hand. It even acknowledges its creamy yeast.  It redefines an otherwise neglected sort of default style of beer reserved for chugging or skunking. This is how beer--all beer--deserves to be made.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,tone77,3.25,"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a gold color with a 1/2 inch head. Aroma is good, hoppy smell. Taste is alright but a bit to hoppy for my liking. Strong bitter aftertaste. Feels o.k. in the mouth, and drinkability is pretty good. this is not a bad beer, but I didn't think it was near as good as the reviews here.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,mltobin,4.27,"I heard many good things about Prima Pils in the past.  Poured into a pint glass, it is yellow color with a thin white head. It smells first sugary, then like you are standing in a big corn field. Taking a sip, it tastes crisp, not too dry with a basic earthy taste to it. Swishing it about the mouth, the mouthfeel is miles ahead of other pilsners with flavor. It leaves you mouth tingling with a light sweetness and all around goodness. Prima Pils is highly drinkable and well worth your time this summer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,bamadog,3.98,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a light hazy yellow; looks a little ""wheaty""; comes with a 1/2 finger head this very white and fluffy -- starts to fade pretty quickly into a full and uneven skim; there is loose and slightly oily lacing that holds lightly to the sides of the glass; very strong carbonation bubbling up from beneath.  Smell: A very mild citrus aspect comes through between some wheaty scents and cracked grains.  Taste: Comes across with a nice mild bitter aspect from the hop presence and holds a very slight lemony/orange peel citrus; a wheaty grainy flavor is mixed with just a very slight hint of yeast, but there is something else and it reminds me of barley.  Mouthfeel: Very lively carbonation compliments a crisp and refreshing body that is light, but not overly so and even holds a very slight stickiness to the roof of the mouth. This is an especially crisp brew.  Drinkability: Quite high. I could easily drink this one in sessions. I've tasted it on tap before, and I think I actually prefer the bottle as the flavor just seems stronger to me now. It's got a nice flavor that is refreshing and body that doesn't weigh one down at all.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,caddybuyer,3.53,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle.  A-Straw colored with filtered clarity and a decent foamy head that laces nicely.  S-Wow..a pils with real hops. Hops and grassy..decent.  T-Clean, crisp, refreshing and hoppy, for the style. I'm not a huge fan of pils, but trying to be objective here. A decent effort.  M-Well balanced overall.

M - medium mouthfeel, light to medium carbonation. T - Wonderful malt and citrus from the aroma with a pleasant hop bitterness in the back. Slight bitter aftertaste. D - Great pilsner. Enough body and flavor to be interesting but still clean and refreshing like I expect from a pilsner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,petroos,4.07,"A: Cloudy, golden yellow with a greenish tint to it almost. Really thick persistent head with large airy bubbles. Carbonation is lively, with large bubbles.  S: Zesty hops and citrus with almost a hint of apple. A bit of flowers.  T: Hops hit nice and hard upfront with lemon zest underlying. Yeast and savory notes on the middle to the bitter spicy finish. Very refreshing.  M: Nice mouthfeel with the carbonation supporting the spicy hop character. Crisp and tight.  D: Love the hoppiness. Refreshing without going overboard. Beautiful example of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jwheeler85,3.78,"This was my attempt and breaking my preference for complex dark beers and trying to get into the whole clean pilsner thing.  A- Light gold in color with about 1/4 inch of head  S- Some astringent hop scents with a floral or grassy background  T- Balanced malty sweetness and bittering hop notes that got stronger as it finished. Very clean tasting.  M- Light and refreshing... almost water-like, but in a good way.  D- Very drinkable. Good example of the style, although I personally prefer pale ales that will give me more flavor an complexity. Tried to keep in mind while reviewing that pilsners were all about being clean and crisp... so in light of that, this was pretty good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,kylesobrien,3.95,"Appearance: I poured this one aggressively, and it responded by rewarding me with a giant dollop of brilliant white foam. There's some nice lacework around the edge of the glass, now that the head has settled a bit. Color is a clear golden yellow -- just what you would expect from a pilsener.  Smell: A very pleasant noble hop aroma. I might be mistaken, but to me, it has the classic Saaz scent.  Mouthfeel: I'm not wowed by the mouthfeel. It's a bit more full-bodied than I'd like, which to me seems out of step with the crispness and otherwise delicate texture.  Taste: This is one of the better American interpretations of the pilsener I've had the pleasure to taste. There's a crisp, hoppy bitterness up front which finishes with a smooth malty taste. This seems inspired by a German-style lager, and the flavor is in line with what I would expect from a beer of this type. I'm not overly impressed, but I am pleased.  Drinkability: Tasty. I'd definitely recommend this among my favorite American examples of the style. I did have to shell out about $12 for a six-pack, though, which strikes me as somewhat ridiculous. Six bottles of Lagunitas Pils can be had for less than $10, and are at least as enjoyable. For me, a drinkable lager should not break the bank. I'm on the opposite coast from Victory, however, which may have something to do with the increased cost. Overall, this is a fine lager, and one I would love to try on draft. At home, it's not hard to finish the first, but it might be difficult to avoid having another.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,TLove,2.41,"I definately do not understand the hype about this beer. If this is the ""golden chalice pilsner"", I'd be thrilled to scratch any pils off my list from now on.  Appearance was clear, bubbly and watery. Not much going on at all. Smell was mildly enticing, perhaps reminiscent of a watered down light lager, but nothing notable. Not much fullness. Watery, full of unattributable light malts and a touch of hops in the mouth make this beer average, but not much more than that.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,thekanna,4.03,"A: Nice golden yellow with about 1 finger of head. After settling, head becomes a thin film that clusters into rings, figure 8's, and alphas resting on the body of the beer. Interesting.  S: Somewhat of a strange belgian yeast funk, mixed with hops, horse stall, and just-mowed lawn.  T: Somewhat more like an IPA than anything. Typical pilsner-like body gives way to fruity esters and a sharp hoppy bite (hop flavor is like a tamer version of the Stone Ruination IPA). The bitterness in the aftertaste is acidic and citrusy, and definitely stays around for a while.  M: Well-rounded body; crisp and refreshing. Finishes dry.  D: Probably the most drinkable Pils I've ever had. Great stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,MusicmanSD,3.18,"Not impressed. Tastes a lot like a pilsner homebrew I dispised. This beer definitely isn't decocted so it's missing that malt sweet-note. Quite hoppy, although not spicy, but tastes very mild in all honesty. Definitely a clean beer, but I think I'll stick with Pilsner Urquell and Budvar. I was expecting the mother of all pils, but I don't think this one adds up to the hype. Good to drink, just not top-line.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Jwale73,3.23,"12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Poured a pale yellow-gold with a two inch off-white head composed of tiny, tightly layered bubbles. Copious tiny bubbles present in solution and effervescing to the underside of the cap. Delicate strands of lacing were revealed as the head receded; good retention. Clarity was translucent. Nose was very subdued; perhaps some grains and a hint of citrus. Taste is predominantly cereal grains, but I get a bit of skunk in the mix, as well as a kiss of hops at the finish. Mouthfeel was light-bodied, effervescent and a little prickly across the middle of the tongue. Pilseners are pretty hit or miss for me, and this is a bit of a miss. Didn't hate it, but wasn't a fan either.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,originalsin,4,"Wow. This is an 'imperial pilsner' if I've ever had one (and a damn good one at that). It pours a light hazed yellow with ample head that laces really well the whole way through. The bottle design really gives you a good idea of what you're getting into here: A great tasting pilsner with an awesome hop profile both on the nose and in the mouth. It smells vaguely of floral hops and some light sweet malts and grains. Prima Pils is incredibly crisp and refreshing with an enjoyable dry, light mouthfeel. It tastes of floral hops and sweet malt but, additionally, you get hints of honey and fruit. This is a really great pilsner worthy by just about anyone's standards.

Very dry tasting. Malts are not very distinguished here.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and dry. Highly carbonated. Light bodied. Not something I am liking. Leaves a super dry aftertaste.

345,1010,IceTrey9785,4.75,"I got this beer on tap at Victory's Brew-pub a few months ago...  A: Nice champagne color -- pale bronze, almost pearl, with a nice head and excellent froth.  S: Hops, hops, & more hops. Herbal undertones (mint, sage, rosemary) and perhaps a little pine sap. Overall, really pronounced, and rather intense (maybe some clover honey too?)  T&M: Upon smelling the beer, you'd think it might be ""heavy"" -- wrong, what an excellent job. This beer is light, crisp, and refreshing. The hops are really there, but the subtle malt balances the bitterness, creating a dry, but friendly brew. There is a hint of lime zest on the finish that really adds to the refreshing nature of this pils.  Overall -- fantastic. Probably my favorite beer on the market. I like to see a hoppy beer that isn't too thick and gritty. Good job by Victory. The bottle is nice, but having this one on tap makes a world of difference.

Lemony and citrusy in the nose, and also very lightly spiced with pepper (?), leading into a mouthful of fizz that feels great on a summer day. Hops are quite present in the taste but not so much that we enter grapefruit territory. A nice line of malt stays present throughout. Definitely a summer beer, and one to keep on hand.

Beer was poured from the bottle into a glass with a nice, light one finger head. Beer was a nice, clear yellow, maybe a bit bolder looking than most pilsners on the market. The nose was the nice, light floral scent of hops backed by a little pale malt. Taste followed closely behind this. The floral notes of the hops and the bitterness that lingered took center stage but there was also some nice sweetness from the malt, but it was not that noticable. Mouthfeel was light with a good bit of carbonation. It worked well for the beer. Drinkablility was out of this world. I could drink these all night thanks to the great flavor and low ABV. A very sessionable brew.  Overall, the best pilsner I have ever had. Also, as a side note, my friends equally enjoyed this.

Appearance: Pours an extremely pale yellow/straw color with only the slightest hint of quickly fading white, watery head and no lacing. Lots of carbonation runs through the mostly clear liquid.  Smell: Malts are almost powdery in the smell and very lightly roasted. Hints of grass, citrus and floral come through.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Taste is very mild and balanced - lots of crunchy, light malts and sweet, almost juicy citrus. Feel is bright and carbonated, filling and slightly drying.  Drinkability: Very high - It is really mild overall, which is really pleasing in this style.

S: A little musty, floral. The 'straw' parallel is still true here, I don't know what to call it other than 'rustic.'  T: This is really my favorite German pilsner, and one of my favorite beers of all time. It hits first with a little sweetness and that little pilsner 'funk' you expect from the style, but then it rises to a new level of amazing as the hops fill out the flavor, bring it all together in an amazingly crisp, light, dry solid -beer- taste. I look at all the other yellow beers out there and say -this- is what you should taste like.  M: Medium-light, good carbonation, nice long finish, hoppy and dry.  D: Fantastic session beer. Great on a hot day. Great on a warm night. Really damn good any time. It's flavorful enough to keep it interesting, yet it's easy to drink many at a time.

A good dose of the acidic bitter hops, again the grass showing through. There's not much to balance it out, but it doesn't feel like it needs much as its very clean and dry on the finish.  A fair bit thicker than I thought on the body, with a solid amount of carbonation.  Easily drinkable, only slight points deduction here for the extra bitterness. Overall I'm extremely pleased with this one, and in fact all 3 from the mix pack. I had seen it in stores, but had been reluctant since it had this pils in it... but then I checked out the reviews here.

345,1010,OnThenIn,4.36,"Appearance: a nice white finger of head with perfect pilsner color. I mean this is basically the perfect appearance for the style. There is even some lacing.  Smell: Some floral and grassy hop smell with a definite malt armoa.  Taste: Very clean with a great balance between hop and malt. There is a hop bitterness that permeates throughout each sip I take. I cannot stress enough how perfectly this beer matches the style.  Mouthfeel: This is a very crisp beer. It is closer to light bodied and finishes a little dry. I personally prefer a heavier body, but considering this is a pilsner I think the body of the beer matches the style perfectly. I would say that the carbonation is very solid in this beer.  Drinkability: Wow, this is a great session beer. At 5.3% and the light body I could easily see myself drinking a sixer of this over the course of a nice long day of relaxing and grilling. The hop forwardness of this beer really makes it stand out from all of the other pilsners I have had.

345,1010,jpkoch1962,2.64,"Hate to be a spoil sport, but I was expecting better. This is advertised as a German Pils, but it came across more as an American lager with essientially an American character. If it was a Bitter or Pale Ale, I would have graded better.  It poued more of an orangey/amber color instead of the pale blonde one would expect. Plenty of biscuity malts sweetness in the nose, which mixed with an assertive citrusy hops.  The taste was essientially malty with a full body, but it was dominated by what appears to be either Cascades or Centennial hops. Perhaps they used Saaz hops; however, the overpowering citrus quality indicated that they either used American Cascades, or spoiled European hops. German Pils feature noble hops, which give a totally differnt taste. The high alcohol alone, puts this beer out of style. There was also a rather sweet chalky texture to this Pils. A typical German Pils features a decent malt body, and an assertive noble hop bite, but overall, a German Pils is very clean and dry on the palate. Prima had none of these attributes.

Wonderfully bracing pilsener taste as a wave of bitter lemon rind asserts itself right away without completely getting in the way of a biscuity malt. Some caramel malt comes out as the beer warms.  Light and dry with a nice hoppy finish and just enough carbonation to be almost *too* refreshing.

This is a real earthy smell and little hops. I do smell some funk with this though as well like tire rubber or something...I can't put my finger on it.  T- This is real earthy tasting with grassy, light pine, and spices in the forefront of the taste ending with a nice malt background and a slight taste of the alcohol.

Smell is of sweet white grapes and faint hops.. maybe a little slight skunkiness but only to a nit picker.  Taste is just about perfect for the style. Sweet white grapes, very light and refreshing... finish is hops but just enough to keep the beer honest. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Drinkability is perfect.  One of the few beers I routine buy in six packs still. Great light summer fare and ultimate session beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Nice pour, smells familiar, but that ends it right there from the norm. Nicely hoppy, not over done, spicy, but drinkable for nearly everyone. This is one great brew, a session beer, a beer for spicy food, a beer for BBQ ribs. It just gets it done.

The taste is almost all hops from the start to the finish. It starts off with some sweet malt and spicy hops that give way to some bitter grapefruit rind hops in the finish.

Smell: Nice mix of yeast, hop, and a tiny amount of spice.  Taste: Good for the style. Beyond your standard Pilsener, the beer adds small amounts of hop and some spice as well. Good amount of character for the style.  Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation with a spicy dryness to it. On par for the style.  Drinkability: This make for a good session beer.

Smells almost cloying in sweetness.  Taste is hops up front. Hops are bitter, but at the same time carry the fruity and floral notes of the aroma. The flavor is most surprising when you pair it with the aroma. Hops are biting and earthy at the end. Clean malt flavor with a slight hint of alcohol esters on the finish.

Pouring it with a ""top pour"" to maximize the head I got a good 2-inch head that lasted more than the German standard of 10 minutes. The head had a ton of protein that suggested a good amount of 6-row barley. Smell of grass.  Taste was quite dry and the dryness emphasized the bitter grassy hops, which were front-and-center in the brew but NOT overpowering. Pilsners are about balance, and I feel that they got it dead-on.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Poured with a half-finger of white foam, which quickly collapsed. Nice lacing on the glass. Interesting note - looking at this beer in front of my laptop created an eerie fluorescent glow effect from the beer, almost like dropping a highlighter into a glass of water and then lighting it with a blacklight bulb. Weird.  Smell Strong floral hops and lemon on the nose, with some faint light malts backing it up. Slight hint of caramel and lawn clippings.  Taste Bitter, mild citrus up front and then a strong attack of bittering hops toward the back of the tongue. Not much in the way of malts in this one, save for a faint sweetness that rolls right to the back of the tongue as the other flavors announce their arrival.  Mouthfeel Thin, prickly, and dry.  Drinkability I'd say this one is middle of the road. It's not a beer I could down quickly, and not one I'd call session. It's also not a sipping beer or one I would want to leave sitting for any period of time.  Overall I'll admit, I'm not a pils guy. It was good, but not my choice of style to begin with. But, in the name of all that is just and good, I had to pick it up because I haven't had it yet. Will I finish the 6-pack? You bet. Will I buy it again. Probably not. But that's just me.

Taste is true to style; some hops in the house for sure, but there's no missing that malty backbone. Starts with the former up front and fades to the latter.  I feel like this was somewhat crimped by the time of year I had it; I liked it, but I could see it really being a homerun in July or so.

Lines and dots of lacing pepper the inside of the glass.  A nice floral bouquet with lemons and crisp, bready malt. Hops are big and everpresent in the nose.  Taste is more lemons and citrus with pale, bready malt and a punching hop bitterness. The hop bite is crisp and really leaves a dry, grassy flavor in the mouth.  A fuller than normal body for a pilsner, but is very welcomed. Carbonation is right where it needs to be.  Drinkability is fantastic. Perfect year round, but especially on a hot day while mowing the lawn.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

The beer is a hazy pale, almost pastel yellow, quite a lot of bubbles rising from the bottom.  The nose is yeasty, biscuity and floral. The taste falls in line with the smell but with a hint of lemon, too. It becomes more caramelly and floral as it warms. The smell focuses more on the malt, and the taste is slightly more on the hoppy side. This beer is the definition of well-balanced and perfect for the style. It's light and refreshing, yet very flavorful; hops and malt are both well-represented and complement each other superbly. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, which lends to the drinkability.

Grain, hops and some grassy floralness, some spice character too in smell. Seems promising. Has a clean pilsner taste. Occasional citrus evident, and slight lemon and bready malts noticeable, but kind of unbalanced with hops dominating.

The carbonation in this beer is very high with a cascade of bubbles rushing to the top, it's appearance reminded me of a Duvel.  Smell: The smell is piney hops up front with some pilsner malt present in the background  Taste: The taste is very piney, bitter citrus, and German styled pilsner malts in the background, I keep thinking Duvel as I drink this beer, it's probably the pilsner malts.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp and light, typical pils.  Drinkability: Very good, it's nice to see an American micro brewery doing such an underrated yet great style, probably because it is such a challenge to do.

345,1010,Buschyfor3,3.9,"Received a 12oz bottle from a fellow BA after a day of beer hunting around Louisville and Southern Indiana. Poured into a 14 oz clear mug (all my pilsner and draft glasses are at college and I'm home on break... go figure)  Appearance: poured a cloudy, golden straw color; foamy, bubbly white head about 1.5 fingers thick that quickly dissipated.  Smell: hoppy herbal zest excites the nostrils; slight bready/malty hints present when I opened the bottle; a faintly sweet, almost grassy hint presented itself as the beer warmed.  Taste: strong, herbal hoppy note hits first, then fades into a mellower, bready finish that faintly reminds me of the taste of clove honey; I can begin to pick out grapefruit notes immediately following the initial outburst of hops. Overall, the taste seemed balanced between the initial sharpness of the hops and the slightly malty mellowness that rounded out the finish.  Mouthfeel: solid carbonation creates a prickly feeling on the tongue that quickly fades. Moderately crisp, but maybe not so crisp as other pilsners I've tried.  Drinkability: I didn't mind the abundance of herbal hops at the start and actually enjoyed the fact that this beer finished off smooth. In fact, I felt it finished smoother than other Czech pilsners like Pilsner Urquell and Czechvar. Only 5.3% ABV and no real warming kick to the beer - I could easily drink a couple of these in a setting.  A decent, hoppy pilsner, but I'm not sure whether I can say I prefer this over Pilsner Urquell, especially since I can get 12 packs of it on the cheap at school.

Smells of herbal, grassy, citrus hop. Light grain.  Light malt under heavy herbal, grapefruit spicey hop. Mild lemon flavor here and there. Much smoother and less crisp than many pils. Intense herbal hop drying never leaves the mouth. I don't like intense herbal hops.  Overall, a good hoppy pils but I just don't like the overabundance of herbal hop which gives the beer an ointment-like flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,YesFest,4.35,"A blonde supermodel, known for her handsome winking in your general direction.  Smells like not too many lagers I've whiffed. Juicy, citrus hops, pseudo-ale fruity esters.  Tastes like it's trying to over-compensate for the modern pilsener, which is no problem with me. I heard that this was ""over-hopped"" and I have to say it's a nice bitter bite for a golden session stock. A citrusy hop gives way to that quintessential german bitter bite. The barley along for the ride would be super smooth, the smoothness comes out with slower long sips.  Makes the mouth feel comfy like one of those cushions that's soft but it's got rough fabric that you just have to get used to. Doesn't take too long!

A: Straw yellow with 1/2-finger nearly white head with decent retention for the style and a smidge of lace.  S: Much more grassy than the bottle version with more herbal qualities. Light pilsner malts still come on strong to complete a very good nose.  T: The flavor is also more haylike and grassy than the bottle version, showing the greater hops emphasis in the draft product. Pale and pilsner malts lend the typical mineral quality.  M: Body is firmly medium with very lively carbonation and malty, more noble hops aftertaste.

A few minutes after the pour, loads of bubbles still rise from the bottom of the glass, and head retention and lacing are remarkable. The smell, a spicy hop combo of grassiness and lemon zest, is sharp and enticing. Upfront, I taste the same flavors as well as some grapefruit, while a small, sweet backbone just appears in the otherwise quite bitter finish. This drinks very light and leaves my mouth clean and hydrated, all of which contributes to great drinkability.

Carbonation has a lively presence. The smell is earthy, citrus hops before a light malt makes its presence known. An herbal undertone is detected as well. The taste is primarily pure herbal hops with a pronounced malt taste. Earthy and citrus tones present themselves as well to add to an excellent balance of flavors. The finish is dry and lingers with a hops bitterness mixed perfectly with a hidden sweetness. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth with a medium body. This is what it seems like the macro posers would be aspiring to. Absolutely drinkable. I'm not as familiar with the pils style as with some others, but I can tell this could easily be a standard-setter for it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Crisp and bitter, noble hops (likely), good finish with just a hint of sweetness in the back. Very refreshing, and a nicely crafted pilz.  Side note: I usually don't care for pilseners.

A: Straw-like gold color with a huge 3-4 finger head that has suprising staying power and leaves a good amount of lacing.  S: A big blast of of noble hops that will clear out your sinuses in a hurry.  T: Dominated by the hops (appropriately enough, given the label art). But it's balanced out quite nicely by the sweet bready malt. Outstandingly thirst-quenching.  M: Effervescently light. The high carbonation has a rather bloating effect.  D: As far as I'm concerned, this is THE session beer. It's basic enough to knock back and enjoy on a hot summer day, but at the same time, it's interesting enough that you don't have to turn your mind off to enjoy it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

The brew tastes of nice hops, with a crisp bite to it. Nice.  The drinkability of this brew is high - could easily get a case of this and drink all night.

Sorry but the skunkiness is just to nasty to ignore here. It just gives the overall experience a really sour ending.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,CHADMC3,4.32,"Pours a straw colored, hazy golden yellow with a vibrant foamy white head of big carbonation quickly dissipating leaving little lacing in the glass.  The fresh, pleasant hop aroma wafts from the glass featuring floral scents and citrus zest. Also a hint of straw or grass, and just a touch earthy.  Big floral hops, wheat & yeast, perhaps just a hint of pepper, and lemon or similar citrus flavor.  Generous carbonation, light to medium bodied, and a great palate.  This is a great beer for everyone. Enough flavor for the true beer lover, but no so aggressive it turns away the novice. Also, extremely easy to drink a few. Enjoy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Kromes,4.11,"Very light straw colored beer that poured a nice head with good carbonation. Slight sweet hoppy smell. Taste is bitter and citrusy and the feel is very light to this beer. The bitterness lingers for quite a while. Reminded me of an IPA, but way more drinkable than an IPA. I can only have one or two IPAs before I get sick of them, but this beer is very drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Terrific stickiness... Completely translucent pale straw color... Clean...  S - European hops... Crystal malt... Lemon... Orange zest... Cut grass... Faint floral aromas... Mildly sweet... A hint of muskiness...  T - A generous amount of maltiness upfront... Biscuit... Sweet citrus... Then the hops rise to the top and never go away... A hint of pepper emerges as part of the aftertaste...  M - Crisp, clean and dry are the first three words to come to mind... Slightly aggressive, yet smooth... Medium bodied...

Grassy, citrusy hops mixed with a hint of alcohol.  T: Zingy, almost tangy, spicy hops on the front, finishing with a peppery bitterness. Very light malt flavor. Amazing amount of hoppiness for a Pils.  M: A light weight dry beer with a lightly astringent bitterness.  D: Overall a very nice beers. For a pils, this beer displays a lot of character and I'm a fan of the assertive hop character.

Sweetened notes of grapefruit pop out mixed with a clean grain flavor. Finish is paired with a breif citrus tang that disapates quickly. Light bodied, possible slight over carbination apparent from thick head that resulted from a easy pour. Plesant offering from victory however very forgetable.

Malty with a spiced fruit (citrus) quality and grassy hops.  Aroma is more malty than the flavor. There's a quick flash of malt to start, then a transition into a mild fruity (citrus zest) hop flavor with a touch of pine. It's the finish where the hopping really asserts itself. Looong bitter finish which goes grassy and drying.  Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp; a touch creamy.  Not bad overall; drinkable, though overrated in my opinion and certainly overpriced.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

No lacing whatsoever, but nice bubbles throughout.  S: Smells of slightly citrusy hops which I like, but the Pilsner bitter is there too which I'm not as large a fan of. The smell is the best I've encountered for a pilsner though.  T: For the style I think it's the best I've had. The hops are present, but I wish more so. The bitter pilsner flavor takes over when this beer is cold. As it warms the taste improves (for me at least) and there is a slight citrus here as well. I wish there were more and less bitterness. More malt would be good too, but earns high marks for creaminess. Finishes clean.  M: Extremely good. Very creamy and coats my mouth in a way I like.  D: For the style it's highly drinkable, this just isn't my favorite style of beer.

Really nice Belgian Lace on the side of the glass as the head dissipates slowly. It is a little more opaque than others in the lager line, and if judged, this would likely be a mark against it.  Aroma: There's a strong hit of hops here, even a bit of floral-ness along with it. (Hey, is floralness a word?)  Taste: It'd be a little arrogant of me to say that this is what a pilsner should taste like. Let me instead say that this is what I imagine a pilsner should be. Stong hit of bitterness right up front that slowly fades away. Then the essence of the hops comes into play, with the bitterness intermingling with some floral tastes and some orangey-citrus hints in the background. If there's a malt or grain here, I'm not finding it, but I don't think that's the point of pilsners. I'm not a fine of bitter beers, but this one has a nice complexity about it which I find intriguing.  Mouthfeel: Brighter than most pilsners, but the effervescence quickly fades. Probably the weakest part of the beer. But still better than most.  Drinkability: If you're a fan of pilsners, this might be one which needs to be sought out. It's complex and far more interesting than other pilsners I have sought out. Not watery at all.

Head pours thick but dissipates quick.  S - Hoppy and fresh on the nose, but also smells slightly musty.  T - A nice, slightly bready, clean pilsner taste; hoppier than others I've had. My only gripe is that the hop bitterness is stronger than the hop taste.  M - Fizz is light and body is thin but not too watery. Good for a refreshing pilsner.  D - I could drink these all friggin' day. goes down easy and finishes clean, making it all too easy to have drink after drink.

S= bold, robust, very nice hops-dominant florals, citrus, sweet malts with a very laundry-starchy nose.  T= I'm a bit put off by the grapefruit-skin bitterness; nice hops bitters aside from that; modest sweet malts, spicy hops notes. This isn't your typical clean Pils- definitely a modded-craft beer. Several times I had to wonder if this beer was skunked, both in the nose or the taste but it isn't. It's been that way with every experience over the past number of years.  M= residual citrus-skin bitterness that for me is a detractor; nice sweet malts, florals. A bit tart on the tongue.  D= I guess if you love this stuff, you love it.

The taste of the beer is one of the best that I have tried for a beer of this color. Really nice flavor with the malt and hops dominating the flavor. Really well done.

345,1010,marvin213,2.37,"It's very light. For what it's worth, I love Victory Brewing Company. I'm concerned that this beer might be the most challenging I've encountered in regards to keeping in mind its style. It's a Pilsener, so it should be light.  Truth is--I've had it before and not really enjoyed it. Objectively, there's basically no head. I'm biased by my preferences (obviously), but this beer doesn't look that good.  For Victory's reputation alone, +0.5 on appearance. The smell is good. It smells like high-quality keg beer...which means, of course, you associate the smell with high-quality keg parties. That's good.  I hate the taste. I knew it coming in, as this is the last of my sixer bought near the end of '08. I didn't like any of 'em. Is it the style? Is it a bad batch? Seems like the smell would be worse if it were. The smell though, independent of the taste, is good. Is it just the brew's nostalgic properties? I basically hate the taste.  I admit noticing the ""A"" BA rating, so I'm trying to figure out what might be wrong with me:&lt;) This is the worst taste rating thus far in my reviewing life, but the BA description is accurate--I'm simply ""not impressed.""  Mouthfeel isn't much different for me. Maybe I don't like this style of beer? I should get another reputable German-style Pils and evaluate. Maybe it's too carbonated for me. Does that vary much among bottling sessions?  The drinkability is what gets me. I followed the thread about how great this beer was to kick back on a day like the Super Bowl. I had one then...didn't like it. I'll certainly consider an update if and when appropriate.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

S- Is pretty simple with a bunch of European hops and German malts. This one has a very floral appeal to it and maybe some spice character.  T- Very earthy with the hops and malts blending very well with one another. Getting a touch of citrus flavor as well as some spiciness. Bready quality's throughout. Some yeast in there to add.  M- Thin to semi medium in bodied with just the right amount of carb to go with it. A nice crispness to begin which fades with some warming.

The one finger white head retained nicely as a cap and left streaks of lacing. The aroma was very appealing, lightly spicy hops, big floral hops, biscuity malt and generally a semi-sweet character. The flavors were very fresh and 'bright.' It started with big floral hops, then went to dry biscuity malt and some sweet malt, light spices (cloves?), lemongrass and a bitter, crisp finish. Pleasantly sweet but not in a heavy-handed way. Marvelously complex for a generally boring style and excellently balanced. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation medium/soft and the body medium. I have no problem say that this is the best Pilsner I have ever to date had (02/21/09), it would be an amazing summer beer and you have to check it out.

Slight citrusy and floral notes on the nose, but apple esters seem to dominate.  Taste is defined by just the right amount of malt, followed by a clean and crisp slight hop finish. I generally don't like pisners, but this is pretty darn good.  This beer does not seem to get better as it warms.  Mouthfeel is, again, clean and crisp, with a medium amount of body. Carbonation seems just a tad bit light for the style.  Were it more available, this would likely become my mow-the-lawn, fix-the-car beer. Very, very drinkable.

The change of pace from the dark ales is refreshing now and then. And what a pleasant surprise this one is. Beautiful bright yellow (slightly cloudy) in the glass with a rich body and decent head that disappeared quickly but laced a bit all the way down. Subtle carbonation visible. Smell was a hint of malt with a nice fruity/floral hops scent, something that continued with the first sips. Rich mouthfeel and malty body with a refreshing fruity (as opposed to piney or spicy) hops flavor behind it. No ""mystery"" tastes (as with some craft-brewed ""German Pilsners""). Tart, dry finish that leaves you smacking your lips for more. Something you could down quite regularly (and frequently) and never grow tired of.

Really earthy, mineral type notes in the smell as well. The hops dominate the palate at first taste as well, but start to share the stage with the mineral and earth tastes as you continue taking sips. This one really grew on me, it has to be one of my favorite renditions on a pilsner. Typically a pilsner is going to struggle to get and hold my attention, but Victory did the job.

Taste is of a lot of Saaz hops to me (not sure if they were actually used), very European taste to it... but also a little hoppier (I'm guessing it was Americanized?). Nothing special but a decent beer to give a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,cpn920,3.53,Had on tap and it poured a straw like color with a foamy haead that was gone quickly. Smelled hops and than more hops. Taste was not what I was expecting and maybe that is because i'm not well versed in the style. My problem was the overwhelming hop flavor. Sometimes hops are over done and IMO this is one of those instances. Finish was almost metal tasting. Beer was light and well carbonated. Not my favorite beer. Probably won't come back to this one as there are too many other beers that I like a lot more. But I still think this is a great brewery...just not this particular brew...maybe the style isn't for me???,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,TheDoorman,2.88,"Mostly clear yellow body with a faint white head that dissipates quickly and minimal lacing. Has a distinctly sweet pale malty aroma. I'm not a big lager drinker, esepcially nto pilsners. This smells like a somewhat refined version of Heineken. More going on with the taste, though I am afraid not in a great way. Some nutty and tartness, but also a real medicinal feel. A good amount of residual biterness for the style, though lacking any definable hop-like citric, floral or earthy flavors. Light, effervescent, watery on the mouth. Very dry. For me, maybe the problem is the style. This is probably a great pilsner, given the ratings, but not for me. The flavor profile is very limited, and the bitter dryness, without any real hop or malt burst just gives the beer an unbalanced and unappetizing feel. I won't be back.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,drtth,4.52,"Poured into a Duvel glass cold from the fridge and given a couple of minutes to take the edge off the chill. Glass of cold water on the side to rinse mouth occasionally. Best by dated 25 March.  Appearance: Pours a bright gold color with the head being close to half an inch. The head begins to thin almost immediately leaving behind a rim of foam around the glass, a bit of froth in the middle and some thin lacing on the sides of the glass.  Aroma: Grassy, bready/biscuity with balanced malt and hop aromas.  Taste: First the malt then the hops, bouncing back and forth. The strong hop presence does not overwhelm but spreads through out the mouth as a counter balance to the malt which sometimes dominates and sometimes does not. Although the hop seems a bit strong the malt comes back in to establish the balance. The long aftertaste is predominantly malt with hints of hop bitterness emerging and then fading again. The hops are clearly not dominating this Pils but rather making it more complex. As it warms the malt presence becomes more pronounced but the hops are still there. I find this one truly ""Prima!""  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is medium, smooth, crisp and dry, with plenty of carbonation.  Drinkability: With the balance of mildly sweet malt, its mild hop bitterness, and its overall freshness of taste I could drink several of these. I keep wanting another taste and find this Pils fresh and refreshing any time of year. Note: I find this one a bit temperature critical in the sense that consumed too cold the hop bitterness is strong. As the beer warms a bit the balance becomes better and it is hard to tell if you are tasting malt or hop or both.   6/14/19  Victory recently reformulated this beer with a slightly reduced bitterness. To me the new version is actually a bit more enjoyable in that the balance of hops and malt works well and easily leads me to want another to follow the one I'm currently drinking.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,AlcahueteJ,4.8,"A - Pours beautifully into a pilsner glass. Golden yellow body with tons of carbonation, streams and streams of bubbles flowing from the bottom of the glass. Rocky white three finger head. Great start.  S - Sweet, bready malt in the nose, very inviting. Balanced as well, as the hops pull through after the malt. Very hoppy for a pilsner, but like I said, very well balanced, not overpowering at all like some IPA's can be.  M - Medium mouthfeel, not too thin as some pilsners can be. Loads of carbonation in the mouthfeel, extremely crisp and dry.  T - Sweet malt hits the tongue right away and lingers for a bit...then all of a sudden my palate gets smacked with citrus and grass. I even burped up hops after the third sip. The balance is ridiculous for a beer that is obviously much hoppier than the typical lager.  D - I'm glad I reviewed this five years into my craft beer experience. I can appreciate a world class lager such as this so much more. I'm thinking Victory should replace Bud Light in the drinkability commercials because this is a beer I could quaff all night long.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Tastes of peppery bitterness up front followed quickly by a melon like sweetness. Finishes with some residual bitterness and peppery dryness. Fairly sweet but nice and crisp in the end. Nice carbonation that complements the finish.  A fantastic pils, especially from this country. Great value for the price and easily can hold up its own against the european pilsners.

Aroma is of hops -- very floral, quite pungent. Over the top hops pervade throughout the tasting of this brew. Initial hoppy spiciness gives way to a moment of mild malty breadiness and then floral hoppy finish. Hop bitterness sticks around on your tounge for about a minute.

Kind of a sour aroma in there as well.  Taste is of hops up front, then a sweet malt taste, some spice-with a bitter bite near the end. Pleasant refreshing aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is very light.  Drinkability is great-one of the most sessionable out there. Very delicate flavours.

Smell- much more interesting smells than I was expecting. Hops aromas flower out of the glass, along with a nice rich light malt scent. Nothing out of the ordinary for a pils, but more than you get with many of them.  Taste- crisp light flavor, melds into a wave of hops, with some malt sweetness also present. Swallow is rich with malt following malt, and fading into a lightly hopped aftertaste.  Mouthfeel- light, crisp, clean. Exactly what you expect from a pils.  Drinkability- good. I've been wanting a good pils for a week now, and this is a very good one, so I could go through half the pack, if I'm not careful.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,StarlightSeraph,4.13,"My first foray into the non-BMC pilsener world. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pilsner glass.  Appearance: Incredibly transparent yellow-gold, with a frothy, white, three-finger head that lingered for quite awhile. Left a good amount of lacing.  Smell: Grassy hops, some citrus. Earthy aromas dominate.  Taste: Sweet, slightly lemony-citrusy flavor with a hop bite that was not nearly as pronounced as the aroma would lead me to believe. Very well balanced, as no one flavor stands out, but all three blend together. A smooth finish, with a slight bitter aftertaste from the hops, and a slight tang from the citrus. Very good.  Mouthfeel: Thin and very smooth  Drinkability: I really, really enjoyed this beer. Despite the popularity of extreme and more complex beers and flavors, it's amazing how satisfying something so simple can be. Nice and refreshing. It's very easy to put down a few of these, and it's a beer I'll definitely buy again. It'd probably also make a good 'transition beer' into the craft world.

345,1010,yesyouam,3.88,"Victory Prima Pils is a sparkling, intense and clear light golden lager with a slowly dissipating small white head. The lacing is thick and persistent. The aroma is fruity, soft and wooden. There is a faint bright citrus note. Light grain provides the backdrop for these noble players. It is tender to the tongue when wet, but leaves a chalky feel. It has a nice, filling medium body. The hops burst onto the scene here, fruity and wooden. It is a loud and bright flavor that persists with the rumble of peppery alcohol and bitter juniper. Wow!

Immediately after swallowing you get a tremendous dose of mandarin orange juice comming through. Its really amazing how much its aftertaste is like mandarin oranges in the can. Moderately strong hops but definately not over done.  Mouthfeel: Perfect carbonation. Great viscosity and very nice texture. Its similar to a Bass ale on the mouthfeel, but a little bit fuller and thicker.  Drinkability: Its very very powerful on the taste factor. This beer needs some food with it for sure if you are going to session this beer. Its got moderate abv so you can have a couple of these bad boys but its a diverse and complex beer that deserves to be savored and appreciated.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,NHGrafx,3.93,"Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle.  Pours a nice semi hazy straw color with a 2 finger head. Not much lacing in my glass.  Aroma at first is very floral from hops. Grains and malts come through, a bit of yeast is present. Some grassy aromas are there too, almost like fresh cut hay. Touch of citrus too.  Taste starts off a bit sweet which quickly yields to bitter hops. Can taste some citrus as well. Some malty flavors come out as well. The hops seem to dominate. Moderately bitter hop finish. Pretty good mouthfeel, smooth and crisp. Drinkability is good.

The taste is crisp with a pleasant amount of hops. Nothing is overpowering-crisp, clean , and hoppy. Prima Pils has a dry finish. The beer is light bodided and easily quaffable.

Produces a sturdy 2 finger head which fades before too long leaving some absolutely gorgeous lacing in the glass. As far as the smell of this lager, there's not much to go by... it's very faint but whole flower hops start to come though, fresh grass, etc. The taste delivers a very crisp, tart bite to it. Some malt sweetness lingers in the back of the mouth. The good carbonation balances the hops and malt and creates a light easy drinking quality in this brew. Mmmm...

Pale yellow color with just the slightest haze, thick white head bubbles up past the top of the glass but is too sticky to overflow.  Good clean smell, citrus and light floral notes. I can't wait to take a sip!  Clean flavor too, all-malt with solid floral and grapefruit notes.  Light body with good crispness, perfectly to style.  One of the better pilsners out there - clean, crisp, and fantastic.  I didn't notice until after I finished it that it was past its ""best by"" date (6/22/08) by about 1 month.

A nice clean smelling beer.  T: Very nice tasting beer. Hops come through very nice but not to harsh. A little spice in there too. But the hops is dominant, and the hops give a nice floral after taste that stays with you. Very nice.  The best Pilsener I have had to date. Nice clean taste. Nothing really exciting about this.

345,1010,Spidey13,3.23,"Prima Pils pours very clear and a very pretty bright yellow color and has a fluffy, white head. The nose is very nice, with lemon zest and noble hop aromas dominating.  The taste has a bit of sweet malt, along with more lemon notes and grassy hop flavors. A harsh hop bitterness shows up on the end, which quickly dominates the flavor in a way that is not very pleasant for me. The mouthfeel is about right on for the style; medium/thin with a fairly high amount of carbonation.  Overall, though I appreicate what Victory is probably trying to do - make a hoppy, craft pilsner - the bitterness is just a bit too harsh and out-of-balance for me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Bartender there intentionally (imo) poured the beer all of the way to the brim, not allowing me to see the head if there is one. I appreciate ""getting more beer"" I suppose but again it would have been nice to see the head if any.  A Negatively affected by the pour at Taco Mac but the body is much like a Budweiser. A basic Pils. (3.0)  S Not much smell. Some distant hops. Reminded me of a Bud really. (2.0)  T Not much taste here. Some grains, distant hops, not happy with this taste. It was just sort of ""not there."" (2.5)  M Thin, dissapointing. (3.0)  D Good but I don't think that I will order this again. (4.0)  Notes: I suppose that it is true to the style but I don't think that I like this style. I love other Victory offerings and so I was looking forward to this one and (as you can tell) I was dissapointed.  Addendum 11 23 08: Alerted by ububru, I may have actually been served a Bud. If so, this would have been the second mistake by the watiress that night. I will keep my comments and my ratings here but pick up a prima pils soon, drink it and rate it (with an open mind) and of course it it is different, I will disgard this review and add a new one.  New review 12 8 08 after re purchase the other day at World Market. Poured from a bottle so I am sure that this is actually a Prima Pils. Freshness date of 12 19 08 (whew!).  A White, bubbly head and a nice but cloudy yellow body. Good look for a Pilsner.  S Kind of typical Pilsner smell but much more scent than say a bud. There might be a sweetness there too. Really nice.  T Oh, this IS a Prima Pils and it is NOT what I was served at Taco Mac that night. The taste is mostly a basic Pils but there are nice grains, maybe even some distanct spices (?) that can be tasted. Really nice Pils and clearly dominate in the style. I burp and get that same Pils burp (you know, the slightly acidic Pils burp) but the taste is so much more interesting than any macro that I have tasted. There might even be a sweetness (?) to it. Really great.  M Nice and light but certainly ""bigger"" than the macros.  D Great. My favorite Pils to date.  Notes: Thanks to ububru for prompting me that I was served the wrong beer.

Taste is malty with a hop bite in the finish. I get some honey and some bready flavors throughout. Medium body, sweet almost sticky mouthfeel, crisp carbonation. Great pilsner I could see a few of these in my future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Offa,3.62,"This is interesting, very hoppy and bitter for the body, but clean, tasty, and light at the same time.  Bright gold, it has a medium, lasting white head, slowly shrinking and leaving a little decent lace.  The aroma is very nice and very German, bready very herbal with a little lemon and a hint of pine.  The taste is lightly malty with a a little honey and a strong herbal-citrus hop flavour with bitterness starting off softly but then taking over quite strongly to dominate the character. It has prominent herbal-citrus hop flavour and bitterness, and is clean and dry in the finish, with the hop taste and bitterness lingering strongly.  I like it, but it is a little too bitter for me, especially considering the light body, and it takes the hop emphasis a little too far for this style. At the same time, the actual flavour is rather light and almost one-dimensional, without the nice play of malt and hop flavours that I like in the style. I definitely prefer a little less bitterness, a little more balance, and more flavour. That said, it is very, very clean, somewhat tasty, interesting, and different. Additionally, although the bitterness brings down the drinkability for me, it is not so bitter as to bring it down too far and I still find it fairly drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

S- Nice honey graham, graininess, nice hop presence with notes of pear, light orange. Nice.  T- Starts out with some nice maltiness with light citrus notes then quickly transitions to some nice dry hops with a residual feel of pear and apple notes. Nice!  M- Low medium carbonation. Nice balance of hops and malt.  D- This is an exceptional german pilsner. I would call it a czech/german hybrid.

Smell: Amazing, pils malt and continental hops, in perfect harmony. No esters, fusels, diacetyl or other flaws.  Taste: Clean grainy taste, followed by lingering bitterness. A tad more bitter than most German Pilseners, however this is probably closer to traditional style than modern german pilsners. I am going to give a 4.5 here.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and lovely.  Drinkability: Jesus, I am not sure I can think of a beer that is this drinkable. I could have 50 or 100. Ok... 5 or 6.  Great Pils.

Smell - Mildly hoppy, with malt and spice notes. Almost a ""grassy"" quality...but in a good way.  Taste - A bit hoppier than your typical pilsner...get a lot of hops with a malt base. Grain taste as well. Leaves a slight aftertaste. Very excellent if you like hops.  Mouthfeel - Huge amount of carbonation. Very light body.  Drinkability - Could easily drink a bunch of these - very smooth and light.  I'm not the biggest fan of pilsners but this is an excellent beer (as a hops fan)...definitely recommended.

345,1010,DavoleBomb,3.95,"Poured into a flute.  4.0 A: A tiny bit hazy. Straw colored. Very nice head retention and steady stream of bubbles from bottle of glass. Leaves plenty of lacing.  4.0 S: Hoppy for the style. Grassy and herbal hops. Balanced well with sweet and spicy malt character.  4.0 T: Hops manifest themselves in the taste as much as they do the nose. Quite bitter for a Pils. Earthy first, then spicy. Hopheads will love this. Though I love hoppy beers, I really don't want my Pilsners to be this bitter. Still, it is done really well if you accept that it's out of the ordinary.  3.5 M: This is the low point of the brew, but it isn't terrible. It could be a little creamier, but that's about it.  4.0 D: Not a boring Pilsner in the least. This Pils thinks it's an IPA.

The aroma is pretty nice for a pils. A bit of citrusy lemon peel provides a relatively hoppy nose. Not a ton going on, but for a pils it's certainly impressive.  The taste is pretty good. Again, a good bit of citrus up front only to finish slightly bready and very clean.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, full of lively carbonation giving a really cleansing crip feeling.  Drinkability is high. It's a solid pils from pour to finish. The first time I tried this beer I didn't like it, but I've since developed a better appreciation for the style.

Floral hops dominate, with a little bread dough in the background.  Taste is the spicy hop bite you'd expect, with some citrus notes. A grainy bread element is there too, and has a bit of sweetness that is a nice counter balance to all that bitterness. Nice craft here.  Mouthfeel translates into a level of drinkability. Fair carbonation keeps the flavors from being too cloying, but you know what you are buying here (look at the label!). My drinkability numbers come down as this is very very good, but in the 2-3 in a row range. I just personally have a hard time heavy sessioning super hop-saturated beers. Not a negative, as it is intentionally off balance and heavy-handed in the hop department. Try it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Smelled strongly of hops as I emptied the bottle into the pint glass, but as it sits the smell settles to a spicy hops and sweet malt.  MMM pils. exactly what you expect. hops up front and in the finish with a little bit of tasty malt. It's just what you expect, but not amazing like a few pils imports I've tried.

345,1010,jdg204,4.35,"One of the staple brews from one of my fav PA breweries, how can this possibly go wrong??  A: Deep, clear yellow, with a big, lacy white head. Nice retention and great lacing.  S: Sweet hop aroma, resembling freshly cut grass or flowers. Some malt is present as well, with hints of citrus.  T: Hops are obviously the standout here, and they are incredibly complex. There's a big bite of bitterness initially, then a lingering spiciness. The hops gradually become rather herbal and earthy. Malts are present but subdued in relation to the hops. They leave a nice touch of sweetness near the finish and give the brew enough of an overall balance to avoid becoming overwhelming.  M: Moderately smooth, the finish is certainly a bit dry. Body is medium, with very active carbonation.  D: Another superstar in the Victory lineup, which comes as no surprise. By far the greatest Pilsner I've had yet, these guys make an awesome big brew out of a style that is usually pretty straightforward.

Smells like thin orange juice and beer. Maybe a sour note.  Light citrus taste. Like an orange squeezed into a glass of bud light. Not so much to my liking.  Very thin bodied. Gonna chug this and move on because I'm not really enjoying it.  I'll most likely read some of the other reviews and try some other pils and maybe come back to this one for a second try. Maybe not.

345,1010,beerthulhu,4.1,"A: Poured a clear, buttery-gold with a 1finger dull white head that was foamy. Retention was short with a strong vibrant showering of macro carbonation bubbles.  S: The nose was fresh lemon juice with a touch of grassiness and fresh grains.  T: The flavor opens with a sharp flowery citrus and dry pale grains. Slightly bitter, more so per style, with grassy notes and flashes of sweet husky grains occur in the middle of the palate before finishing off with a tartness of lemon peels. Overall this was very hoppy for a pils. A mixture of traditional fine german malts and flowery hops combine with a aggressive American influence of west coast hopping gives this a new twist with great results.  M: sharp with a lively tingle from the carbonation. Slick feel with a dry tart finish.  D: Good drinkability and good enjoyment.

345,1010,cameraman,4.5,"A bright golden color, with a white three inch thick head, that kaces slowly down the glass. A grassy, spicy scent, that is followed by a malty biscuity fragrance. A light bread and biscuit flavor starts out the taste. It then blends to a grassy and mild citrus bitterness, that lingers on the palate for some time. A watery thin feel at the front, it then gradually gains weight as it reaches the back of the palate. The scrubbing sensation of carbonation finishes it all out at the end. This is a fantastic session beer, easy to drink, great flavor, strong aroma, the low alchol level, means I am drinking several before the night is over.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Peppery, zesty, herbal. Lots of bitterness on the tongue. Perhaps a touch of grains.  Fast, clean dry finish.  Drinkability is fantastic. Really sad I only have one bottle of this.  I'm not a pilsener fan overall but this one is fantastic.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,GratefulBeerGuy,4.45,"Thanks to Amy and Ryan at the blue Trout Grill in Keene, NH for bringing Victory to New Hampshire first!!  A classic looking Pilsner, pure golden color, great carbonation and a rather fluffy, well-retained head. Classic look.  The nose has mildly sweet malt, nearly buttery with a massive herbal effect, mildly spicey with earhy and great wheatiness, the yeast is big time effct! mucho hops pop out later on.  The balance is sublime, this crispy pils malt is snappy, yet smooth....a good amount of heft to balance out the wonderfully robust earthiness, which inludes, mild pepper, zesty wheat and a massive earthy and tangy hop right at the end. The hops are very bold in the finish, but that is what makes this Pils unique is the complexity of the hop...it might be a stretch from the classic European styles, but it totally works! It's a dry, clean feel with a smooth finish....very high on the quoff factor.  The drinkability is SICK, this is my ultimate session brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Magpie14,3.93,"Appearance: light yellow hue...a touch of gold in it. No head and lacing  Smell: hops, big floral hop smell. Not to much else going on...seems like a good burly pilsner overall.  Taste: big burst of flavor and hops to boot. Spicy and bitter throughout, goes down very smooth. Aftertaste hangs around and makes you crave more. I am getting some grains in their also.  Mouthfeel: smooth feel and medium body. Great stuff! A six pack would be gone in heartbeat in my fridge. Nice brew!  I have always been a fan of the Victory's beers",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,seaoflament,4.38,"Picked up this single bottle yesterday at South Bay Drugs and Liquor.  Pours a straw, very pale, yellow with a decent two inch foam.  The aroma is of pale and nutty malts, slightly grassy but mostly spicy hops. It has a very delicate flowery aroma that comes through rather nicely...a bit of sweet corn too. I'm also getting some hints of caramel. A little buttery as it warms up.  Tastes very similar to the aroma, a wonderful nutty malt profile with a flowery and spicy hop finish...really well balanced. Finishes with some earthy bitterness and a little dryness which makes this absolutely drinkable. I also get a blast of citrus near the middle.  Pretty full bodied for a pilsner with medium carbonation...extremely drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,TerjUGA,4.84,"A-Poured a golden straw color, nice size head with good lacing.  S- smells a bit sweet, hints of hops and maybe a little citrus.  T- Taste amazing, hoppy all the way through but not to much, a little malt to it. very sweet in the middle, a bit of honey to me. hints of grass and citrus. great balance.  M- perfect feel for a pils, nice and crisp. great feel.  D- great drink, i love this beer, my favorite beer from victory so far. great brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,roadhouse,4.33,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pilsener glass.  Appears a somewhat hazy pale straw yellow with a one inch bubbly white head. It quickly sinks down to a thin skim. Leaves a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma is nice and hoppy - the earthy/herbal type, with a nice grainy, slightly sweet malt backing.  Taste has an initial burst of aforementioned hops that last all the way through to the finish. After the initial sensation some sweet maltiness is detectable for a short period before it is quickly taken over by the hoppiness. Herbal hops linger long after the swallow.  Mouthfeel is medium-light, crisp and smooth.  Enjoyable pilsener for sure. One fine session beer. Victory is one of the better American brewers of German lagers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,stoutman,3.6,A quite hoppy pils. The aroma is a sweet malt scent. Color is a light bright gold with good carbonation and a white head that drops down thin. Taste is somewhat bitter. Starting with a light body it goes down with a crisp feel. Finish jumps out as hoppy with some sweetness and then a bold bitterness with just a hint of malt.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,aquatonex,4,Had this on tap at Maxie's in Ithaca.  Pours slightly hazy pale yellow with a few fingers bubbly head. Very carbonated. Nose is crisp and slightly citrusy from clean hops. Taste follows with a great balance of citrusy bitter hops and crisp light maltiness. Goes down easy and makes you want more. I'd have had more if I wasn't full from dinner.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,nasty15108,3.97,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pilsener glass.  A - Poured a hazy yellow/straw color. The pour produced a thin head of white foam that gave way to a spotty film.  S - Floral/herbal with hints of fresh cut grass and citrus. Malt presence also detected.  T - Malty up front with definite herbal notes. Finishes off dry, with a slight hop bitterness.  MF&D - Medium bodied and pretty tasty. Definitely not your typical Euro Pilsener. Give it a shot if you haven't already.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,trbergman,4.63,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into pilsner glass. Freshness dated November 5, 2008.  Appearance - The beer is between straw and amber in color and a bit hazy. It has an attractive collar of pure white foam.  Smell - A touch of malt, perhaps, but mostly noble hop aroma. Floral, herb-like.  Taste - God, I'd almost forgotten how much I love this beer! Hop bitterness dominates the flavor profile but without the hyperaggressiveness of a DIPA. There's a smidge of toast flavor from the malt, but it's nearly crowded out by the grassy, citrusy hop flavor.  Mouthfeel - Perfect: dead-on for the style. Light-bodied and crisp, with fine carbonation.  Drinkability - Only halfway through I was ready for number two. Very sessionable. I could drink a few of these while watching a game or grilling outside.  I first tried Prima a couple years ago and it was one of my first ventures into craft beer. With a lot more drinking experience, most of it limited to ales, I'd put this beer forth as a challenge to anyone who tries to malign lager as somehow inferior. Prost!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Herrbrokt,4.6,"Real light golden Hay. Real nice head that sets an example for lace.  Smells like hop paradise.  Prima indeed. Wow. A hop cascade finale. Fine woods, pine, dough, little lemon citrus. But Completely mild and relaxed.  dry but not overdone in any way.  I'll drink the lot! This is how I want my pilsener.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,danielocean03,4.2,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pilsener glass.Appearance is a transparent golden straw yellow with a thick two fingers of bone white fizzy head that slowly fell back to moderate lacing. Active carbonation slowly builds up a light cap of white foam. Aroma is classic pilsener, crisp and clean with that skunky hoppiness and maltly earthen undertones. Hop profile is more pronounced in the aroma than most of this style. Taste is more of the same, crisp and refreshing, grassy/floral hops, malt and wheat. Finishes dry and smooth, nice light skunky aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little rough, but expected with a lighter bodied brew with moderate to high levels of carbonation. Drinkability is outstanding, clean and refreshing beer with great flavor, excellent session beer. Highly recommend, will seek out again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,currysage1,4.37,"Pours a crystal clear goldenrod with a fine textured 1.5 finger rocky head. Lots of sticky lace all the way down, with a layer of head staying lightly all the way down.  Aroma is of very bright and inviting, plenty of hop pungency coming through, citrus notes specifically grapefruit, dried hay, earth after it rains.  Taste is very earthy in the beginning almost like dried hardwood, then moves right into the hop bite, definate pine resin, and peppercorn, nicely bittered for a Pils.  Feel is spot on, silky and easy to go down, very refreshing, carbonation is very pleasing and with the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Doomcifer,4.75,"Pours a clear bright golden color with a small head that fizzles away with lots of bubble action. Smells very german. German malts, noble hop spice. Tastes of more noble hops, doughy german malts, extremely crisp, light, good carbonation, ridiculously sessionable beer. Terrific easy-drinker and highly enjoyable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Phillyduke,4.42,"12 oz. bottle with a Best By date of Sep 08 2008 poured into my Prima Pils pilsener glass.  A: Beer is a pale light gold color with a slight haze. A huge three-finger head of foam threatens to crest out of the glass, then very slowly recedes leaving gobs of sticky lacing down the side of the glass. A thick white cap sticks around throughout the drink.  S: Aroma is a hop assault on the nose. Loads of spicy and herbal German noble hops.  T/M: Hops abound in this one. Herbal and spicy hops dominate the taste, but never become completely overwhelming. A doughy malt base underscores the spiciness and the crisp carbonation tingles the palate. Clean-drinking and light-to-medium bodied with a long, dry bitter finish.  D/O: This Pils is a hophead's dream come true. A sublime beer that is both over-the-top in terms of hopiness and yet understated in it's effect on the palate. You could drink this all afternoon and never become fatigued. I've not much experience with true GERMAN pilseners, but this one is certainly the best-of-breed among many fantastic PA offerings.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,biggred1,4.45,"Beautiful hazed almost white blonde with a medium bodied head. Minimal lace. Nice hoppy smell with hints of fresh doughy bread.Tastes like a good euro pils on steroids, delicious, fresh and a nice dose of hop bitterness that doesn't overpower the flavor.

345,1010,KeefD,4.28,"200th review! Pilsner glass. Three fingers of bone-white foam sit on top of a bright golden yellow body. Plenty of carbonation bubbles make it glisten. Aroma of big grassy hops, a bit of lemon rind, and husky pale malts. Flavor wave of bitter, grassy, spicy hops, backed up by a crisp, dry dose of pale malt. Slightly herbal in the hop flavor, slightly grainy and cereal like in the malt profile. Bone dry on the finish, refreshing, smooth, full-bodied. A wonderful example of a Czech-inspired, American Pilsener.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,SPLITGRIN,4.15,Three fingers of very active off white bubbles fade in minutes leaving dots of lace. Body is a glowing pure golden yellow. Nose is crisp with yeasty wheat and a lite hop profile. With first sip you get a clean fresh balance of hops and wheat. Very crisp and refreshing while carrying a balance of hop bitterness and yeasty sweetness. Smooth drinking. Carries a mouthfeel that is slightly thick and really invites the next sip. Super drinkable.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BravoTwo,4.6,"A - Nice clear yellow hue with decent head, that fell quickly back into the beer. Good carbonation.  S - Nice floral hops aroma, very beautiful smelling. Clean and crisp.  T - Nice hops taste here. A very clean tasting, uncomplicated pilsner which makes it a really pils IMO.  M - To style, and not bad just an average clean mouthfeel.  D - Way drinkable. A great summer pilsner (or any time for that matter) an excellent example of a great beer from Victory  EDITED on 6/4/09  - pale straw yellow color, with really nice foamy head and strong lacy retention clinging down the glass as it drinks.  S - Floral, spicy hops character in the nose with fresh lightness. Good smelling pils.  T - Hops.... Starts bitter and slowly the floral earthiness progresses forward. Slightly chewy malt at the backbone. Lightly fruity notes are present as well. Overall taste is exceptional and well developed.  M - Crisp and clean, well carbonated in the mouthfeel.  D - Exceptionally good drinking pils and really well designed beer, definitely worth your while as a great example of a nice hoppy pils.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jdubjacket,4.4,"Bought a six-pack of this at Green's this past week. I normally pass by pilsners, macro and micro alike due to the stamp that AB has put on pilsners. Anyway, I saw the reviews on here, and thought I should get over my view of pilsners and try this one out. I am damn glad that I did! Poured from the bottled into a DAB mug (running out of clean glasses). Pours a hazy yellow color with a good head that remains about 1/8"" thick throughout the beer. Smell is grassy, natural, and with German malt. Taste is much more complex than any pilsner I have had to date. Sweet - honey maybe?, grassy, malty, and finishes slightly bitter. This would make a fantastic session brew, and it might have to be a standard beer in my fridge.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,JamesS,3.65,"Pours a nice golden color, although with a ton of carbonation and it's a bit cloudy; has a nice bit of head with some good lacing. Nice malty scent, slight skunkiness. It has a good crisp malt flavor, with a bit of pepperiness at the end. It's not the smoothest going down from teh carbonation, but not overly rough.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,glid02,4.18,"Got this on-tap at the Corner Tavern on Edgewood in Atlanta.  Pours a good golden color that's completely clear. One-finger white head that diminishes quickly into a wispy layer of bubbles on top and a small ring around the glass. Lacing is alright.  Smells pretty grassy. There are also hop notes in there, and a slight sweet smell. Not bad, but certainly not great.  Tastes like one of the best pilseners I've ever had. Decently sweet flavor with spices and hops. Spices are not very strong, and the hops add mostly bitter taste. Everything works very well together, and it's very complex for a lager.  Mouthfeel is good. It's not very thick but that's not to be expected. Carbonation is good, it really helps bring out the flavor.  Drinkability is good. Something else brings itself to the forefront on almost every sip. I'm not a huge fan of pilseners, but I could drink a lot of this one.  Overall it's a very solid offering. I wouldn't buy this a whole lot, but only because I like ales better. If you haven't tried this give it a shot, it's pleasantly surprising.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,palmdalethriller,4.42,"The pour leaves a great inch or so of head that leaves a decent amount of lace that typically falls back into the beer. The liquid is a very bright, very clear golden yellow with lots of good sized bubbles floating up to the top. The Prima Pils smells wonderful. It's a spicy, flowery smell that tastes wonderful. After smelling the beer for an inordinate amount of time I decided to finally taste it and wasn't disappointed. The hops are definitely right out front, but it's very nicely balanced with a smooth and crisp finish. The feel is somewhat average - although it's not overly thin there's really nothing memorable about how it feels to drink it. It's to style certainly, just not overly remarkable. This is incredibly drinkable. I think that for my first sunday football get together this year this beer will play a major role.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,dancinwillie,2.7,"Pours a lovely shade of gold. Has a dense, tight white head, which drops pretty fast, leaving no lace.  Smells of spicy hops, and malt.  I taste mainly spicy hops, with a restrained malt flavor. Somewhat earthy as well, grassy flavor coming through. Decent flavor, although not really my cup of tea.  Good full mouthfeel. A little chewy, which I wasn't expecting, but it seems to work.  Overall, I wasn't impressed, although I would drink this over just about any mass marketed lager. It's not that it's bad, just not what I enjoy. Maybe my palate hasn't evolved to this level of subtlety yet. I'll try it again down the road, and see.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Stonebreaker,4.2,"Appearance: Very light yellow, according to style. Decent head.  Smell: Sweet and hoppy.  Taste: Hops up front fruity, and spicy and bitter in the back. The hops in this one are not simply abundant, but also abundantly flavorful, my first time having sweetness seemingly from the hops.  Mouthfeel: Can't remember due to bad notes, only the score.  Drinkability: Very drinkable, my first brew from Victory and it definitely lived up to the hype. I'll be grabbing a sixer of this one soon.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,swizzlenuts,4.3,"The beer is poured with a copper colour and a nice inch head. Quite good retention on the head and a lot of carbonation. The pilsner smell definitely comes through in the nose with subtle hints of fruits. The taste of the beer is quite surprising, the general pilsner flavour doesn't come out, but a lot of more subtle fruits come out. The aftertaste is slightly bitter, it makes a great addition to the beer.The flavour is some lemon mixed with a pleasing sweetness. It's a bit watery on the mouthfeel, but incredibly drinkable.  This is probably the best pilsner I've ever had; I'm not a fan of pilsners at all really, but I find this one doing a great job.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Reanimator,4.35,"Wow. I was completely surprised by this pilsener style from Victory. Enjoy by Aug 18 08 printed on the label.  Pours a hazy, pale straw color with the characteristic musky, grassy, malt aroma. Very delicious, with lemon-banana grassiness on the front, characteristic muskiness in the mids, and ending pleasantly with a unique and long lasting hop bitterness on the finish. Very crisp and light mouthfeel, practically perfect for the style.  Overall, this is one of the best pilseners I've had the pleasure of tasting - hugely drinkable, refreshing, and surprisingly unique.  Thanks to swizzlenuts for this one!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Murchmac,3.5,"Nice head, nice carbonation, good looking pilsner.  Aroma you can smell a couple feet away. Sweet floral smell.  Bitter hoppy taste at first, followed by sweetness.  Full bodied for a pilsner, stingy aftertaste.  This is a lot like the moonlight lunatic lager.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Chinon01,4.2,Appearance - Golden metallic color with thin clinging head.  Smell - Good noble hop aroma. No malt (appropriate for style).  Taste - Grassy and lean with a hint of malt. Some floral and pronounced hop bite.  Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Hop bite makes it a little less than very good.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,unionturf,3.1,"Had on tap for $1.50 at Brixx.  Clear yellow color with little smell. Taste was surprising considering the look of the beer, not bad but not great either.

345,1010,MSchae1017,4.3,This beer was tasted in a pilsner glass from a bottle.  This beer poured a bright gold with a big foamy white head that holds for a little bit but fades leaving a thin film the whole way down and lacing some. The smell is a nice mixture of barley malts and agressive hops. The taste is very similar to the smell with the hops coming out more as the beer warms. The beer has a good body and carbonation. Overall a very drinkable beer one that I would love to stock the fridge with in the summer.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,thisisshsas,4.13,"A- Light yellow coloring with a large foamy head, very clear and indicative of the style.  S- light crisp smell, it could be a little stronger to be better.  T- nice and light, flowery side flavor with a slight crispy hop taste thats extremely refreshing. Carbonation gives a slight burn of the tongue. One of the best lagers I've ever had.  M- unlike some lagers, the prima pils has a strong enough flavor that it doesn't fade after a few few seconds. You can swish it in you mouth and get more flower style taste.  D- extremely drinkable, a beer for the usual bud drinker and the beer connoisseur as well. Not my favorite style but you have to recognize good when it shows up though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,kinger,3.78,"Aroma is crisp with a friendly bite to it, sweet and hoppy could be more pronounced. Poured a very pale golden yellow with an enormous white pillowey head that left some impressive lacing down my glass. Clean mouthfeel that is wonderfully smooth which teams with the flavor to make this beer incredibly drinkable. Flavor falls right in line with a nice crisp and snappy profile. The hops (I believe saaz are commonly used) round out a lightly malted base creating a nicely balanced flavor. There is a beautiful easiness to this pilsner ( I don't want to call it simple ) which is what makes it so very good and easily enjoyable. Not my favorite style and for the price I will likely not re-visit this too often.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,youngblood,4.4,"A - Beautiful gold coloring, sparkles when held up to sunlight. Poured to a two finger head into an imperial pint glass. Head retention was about one minute. Leaves some pretty lace on the glass.  S - Smells of a mixture of sweetness and bitterness, hops come up a little bit in the back in the scent.  T - Very interesting. Has a strong pilsner flavor at the opening followed swiftly by the freshly cut grass bitterness of hops. Well balanced.  M - Smooth on the tongue, very light.  D - Low ABV lends itself to being a session beer. The hops and pilsner style make this quite a refresher!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Smell is faint, but there's some lightly toasted grains and some noble hops: very grassy and floral.  Taste is toasted grains, and grassy, floral hops, with a crisp, bitter finish. There's a very distinct petroleum characteristic, much like a good viogner.  Light-bodied, very crisp and clean.  Wonderful drinkability.

345,1010,bluemoonswoon,4.6,"12oz brown bottle poured into a pilsener glass, best before date: 10/8/08.  A: Pours a clear and clean looking light golden straw with a nice inch thick and rocky egg shell white head that leaves just as thick a lacing down the sides of the glass. Nice little ropes of carbonation doing their best to support the head. Hard to think how this beer could be improved on any more, just give me a tiny bit more carbonation throughout the session, otherwise perfection in a glass.  S: Grassy and sweet with a mild floral hop spiciness. Germal pils through and through.  T/MF: Very grassy, haylike and floral, lemon zest and comes to mind and backed by a solid malt grainiess. Mouthfeel is mildly coarse and leaves the slightest of drying sensations on the tongue. Feels full bodied for a pilsener if that makes sense. I mean it obviously doesn't drink like a dopplebock but its not yellow fizzy water either, I suppose I could sum this up by saying it has a solid chewiness to it with a mildly lingering hop profile, nice nice nice.  D: One fine beer! Who says pilseners can't be flavorful. Insanely drinkable, good any time of the year and a wonderful American take on the style. I was worried that hops would dominate this beer but they play a well defined role in this beer, wonderfully paired with the malts. Tasty tasty stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

A deep but clear golden color, with a lacy white head.  Floral, not particularly bitter, hops on the nose. Good, crisp, but pretty standard.  Clear and nicely noticeable malt graininess and nuttiness compliment the foll bodied hop taste. Very crisp and refreshing feel. Leaves behind a perfect, slight twinge of hop bitterness on the palate, inviting you to drink more. Maybe a lot more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,ATPete,3.79,"12oz bottle  best by date is unreadable but i have reason to believe this is a fresh bottle.  Prima Pils pours a slightly hazy yellow/orange color with a monster foamy white head that leaves some sticking. The nose is very impressive and surprisingly large, lots of big fruit esters and (Belgian?) yeast. A metallic note surfaces as the beer settles. The big fruity/grassy character of the nose really transfers into its flavor, over all balanced, decent pale malt backbone and a dry hop profile, it sports a rather bitter but not offensive aftertaste. Spicy and farmhouse funky, this reminds me of a 'light' saison rather than a true pils. Light/medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation on the tongue. Its fairly drinkable, and would be great in the hot months.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Generik420,4.63,"New to the state of Indiana is beers from Victory Brewing Company based in Downingtown, PA. I have had a few of their offerings and have yet to be disappointed. So it is with great pleasure that I can review the Prima Pils and gleefully say I didn't have to trade to get this, it is now here in Naptown!  One of my bigger complaints with the craft beer industry is the lack of pilsners. It's almost like the industry as a whole has seen what the big 3 have done to the style and they are content to let them get away with it. Well Victory has decided to fight back with their Prima Pils which is an outstanding pilsner that can stand shoulder to shoulder with some of the finest from Europe. Prima Pils pours a bright golden yellow and in the right lighting, it almost gets a neon glow to it. It is really something to behold, with a gorgeous bright white and thick head gracing the top. Eventually that head will slow drop out but continue to leave lacing all the way down the glass.  The first thing you notice when you raise the glass up to your face is the hops aroma. Very distinct noble hops layered on top of fresh cut grass.. oh so inviting! Taking a sip and you realize that the flavor lives up to the aroma. The beer has a clean and crisp hop bite that really demands that you to take another swallow. The hops are somewhat grassy in nature and leave the beer with an outstanding balance between bitterness and malt. On the tail end, that bitterness lingers lightly on the back of the tongue to remind you that you still have more in the glass.  This is an absolutely world class pilsner beer and would compare well with brands from Europe like Stiegl, Warsteiner, Radeberger, etc. So for those of you out there that have shied away from that pale pilsner style, either because of what the macros have done to the style or because many times imports have that 3 months in a cargo hold taste, give this one a try.

345,1010,gunnerman,3.95,"Recieved in a recent trade, thanks Adam. Poured a pale yellow with a fluffy foamy head. Smell is very citrus, sweet grass and a bit of crisp lemon goodness. Taste was where this is at, I was so thirsty and craving a beer, boy this went down well and quickly, taste is very mild highly carbonated sweet on the toungue with light malt and a bit of hop bitterness not overwhelming. This is one good summer beer it goes down so smooth and really quenches the thirst.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,NolateM,4.48,"""Best by"" date is about a month away, so I'm in the zone...  Yellow, slightly hazy pilsner with a perfect lingering head.  Crisp flavor, reminiscent of corn nuts, bready malt, hint of yeast, and with a pleasantly bitter, zesty hop finish. Hoppier than your average pilsner, which if you ask me is a good thing.  Lively carbonation, easy to drink plenty of this. This is THE quintessential pilsner, and a tried & true favorite summer beer.  About $8.50 a six-pack",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,FtownThrowDown,3.85,"Pours a very light, pale yellow in color. A nice half inch head forms on the pour. Smell is malty with some underlying floral qualities. Taste is much the same, but with more of the underlying floral hops coming through. The taste is much better than the smell. Clean and non-cloying on the mouthfeel. This is a good pilsener.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,chrisny4205,4.72,Straw yellow. Bone white head that kept me company most of the testing. We became close friends.  Smell got better the more I tasted the beer. Earthy to piney smell.  This beer went from good to amazing after the fourth sip. A great example of a German pilsner. Such a delicate beer that lets its flavors come at you one at a time. Sweet maltiness then erased by the bittering hops. The flavors are light and very well balanced.  Sat well. Not a big body. This is a delicate brew.  This beer could be drank at anytime and all the time.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Seanibus,4.6,"This is what a Pilsner should be. It is one of a handful of American-made pilsners that simply set the standard for all the others.  Pours radiant yellow and perfectly clear,with a big fluffy head and streams of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The head fades slowly to large, luxurious lacing. The aroma is powerful, bright and grainy with a slight lemony tinge and subtle, smooth floral hops. The flavor is honey-like, with a powerful pils grain backbone and a surprisingly strong hop bite on the finish. The mouthfeel is thin and pleasing with a good carbonation bite and a bit of bitterness developing and clinging on the back of the mouth.  This is a superbly drinkable beer, light and crisp enough to win over Macro fans, but complex and subtly hoppy enough to win over craft-beer-only purists. It's hard to do better than this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,xare,3.18,"Appearance was a nice golden color with a thin lacy head. It was very inviting and nice to see but a bit disappointing with the small head (looks like soap scum, that's it).  Smell was of malt and hops - better than average but nothing memorable that made me salivate.  Taste was average at best - could taste malt and hops and wetness in general, but again, nothing that really distinguished itself and made me want to have it again.  Mouthfeel was a surprise. It definitely was very full and had some meat on its bones but didn't go down very crisp or clean. That kind of balanced out for an average sensation.  Drinkability was decent - finished it pretty quick but I doubt I'd search out 6-packs of this beer simply because I have so many other options I'd go for instead of going to the trouble of finding this beer. If it was readily available without a struggle, I'd buy 6ers for sure but as is, its availability limits its drinkability for me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,oaktown,3.95,"Here's the thing... this is a good Pils... but it suffers from what I call JD Drew disease. It's a good Pils but for the price I pay for it, it better knock me off my chair and it does not.  As good as it is, is it really all that much better than other (read: cheaper) beers of the same category? Maybe, maybe not. And for two dollars more, I'll take the cheaper. Still a very good Pils.  A: Great golden appearance.  S: I enjoyed the smell. Nice and crisp. Smells take you places, and this one brought me back to Central Europe (the good parts).  T: Good and crisp. Nice kick to it. Not as complex as I would like, but for a Pils this one has some good meat on the bones.  D: A little disappointed, actually.

A: Hazy yellow with one finger of pure white head, that receeds to a thin rim and leaves moderate spidery lacing.  A: Grassy hops and wheat. I beleive there is a touch of lemon in this as well. The grass hop aroma is balanced quite well with the strong malt backbone.  T: As expected from the style. Very crisp and clean. Spicey. Malts win the battle, but still a well balanced brew. Beer finishes slightly stingy, and somewhat dry.  M&D: Light body and suprisingly little carbonation, I would have thought that with the crispness of this beer, there would have been more.

Light yellow in color, it had a light floral and hoppy smell. Tasted nice and nutty/maltly wit ha sharp hop bite finish. Reminds of european pilseners - very flavorful but not overdone. Good carbonation, light and refreshing. What you would expect from a pilsener.  Of the three victory beers I have had, this is my favorite.

A: A light yellow-gold with a relatively thick, creamy head that retains well and produces some nice rings of lace all the way down the glass.  S: An intense, rich aroma with some faint grainy malts and loads of herbal and grassy hops. Some light lemony aroma, too.  T&M: Sweet grain malt backbone with a huge herbal, lightly spicy hop flavor. The finish is pleasantly drying. Body is medium with an astringent feel.  D: Definitely a quaffer. This beer is tasty, zesty, and refreshing.

Bitterness is a combination of lemon and pepper with a hint of grapefruit that tastes out of place. Malt is biscuity with a dash of ripe banana. Finishes dry with a lingering pepper bitterness.  M: Medium light body with the right amount of fizz. Feels a little oily.  D: This didn't do much for me. Seemed too bitter for the style in my opinion. Good session beer nonetheless.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Some yeast, malt and spicy hops are all there up front.  T. Very well balanced pilsner here. The malt is evened out nicely by some bitter earthy hops.  M. Light and crisp. Quenching.  D.

345,1010,pittvkyle7,4.55,"A- Clear and pale yellow in color with an inch and a half white head with nice retention, a touch of lacing  S- When you pour it you get a blast of some bright fresh citrus hops, but that fades to a sweet malty aroma  T- this is some good stuff here! It tastes very authentic and very similar to other german and european pilsners. I love the way Victory makes this American by increasing those european hops. It is very hoppy but not overly so. The pilsner malts are biscuty and cracker like and sweet. The hops blance that sweetness nicely and leave some bitterness for the finish.  M- meadium light body and alot lower in carbonation than other pilsners  D- very tasty and very drinkable.

Very clear but this is as it should be.  Smell- Saaz hop sweetness and two row light malts a hint of honey grahams. This is shaping up to be a fine pilsner. A light hint of feet on the nose. I guess I'll see how nice it is.  Taste- Saaz is through the roof. Saaz hops and light malts, creamy and highly carbonated. Some Hallertau earthy spiciness, Munich malts in abundance. Quite acceptable. Crisp, somewhat bitter and drying.  Mouthfeel- Light and fluffy. Light-bodied and well carbonated.  Drinkability- A wonderful and well made pilsner. I was surprised by Victory on this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,clayrock81,4,"A yellow, almost seethru straw color with great carbonation that keeps a constant head. A hoppy aroma dominates the nose, with hints of grass in the background. A medium-bodied beer which holds well since this beer is all about the hops. Has that dry, crispy sensation with a bitter backbite but goes down smooth and tasty the whole time. Some sweetness derived on the sides from some sweet malts, and unlike some pils that are spicy this is more citric/earth-toned based. I'd have another one anytime.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,johannasclimacus,4.3,"To sum it up very briefly, this is an outstanding, crisp pilsener from Victory. The mouthfeel is light and smooth, and the beer isn't very filling at all. The taste is somewhat hoppy, but I didn't find it to be aggressively bitter. I thought it was more of a smooth and subtle bitterness, which makes this a perfectly drinkable brew.  Highly recommended. I've only had a handful of pilsners but so far this is my favorite.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

S- Smell was all hops wih an herbal/grassy bite.  T- Aggressively hoppy for a pilsener. The hops were refreshing and spicy. Citrus/grass/earthy flavors. Nothin else here, straight up hops!  M- Perfectly carbonated and decent body.  D- This one could be drank all night long with no problems. Perfect session beer IMO. Also good introduction beer for many.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Appearance - beautiful straw gold slightly hazy color with moderate carbonation activity.  Smell - lots of spicy citrus hops on the nose with a detectable biscuity malt scent underneath.  Taste - initial flavor is of bitter hops, followed by a nice mellow biscuity malt character that comes through thereafter. Nicely balanced.  Mouthfeel - has a lively crisp mouth feel - slightly prickly almost but in a good way.  Drinkability - this beer is an easy drinking session beer with a lot of character for the style. I would put it up against any pilsener from the Czech Republic or Germany - simply one of the best pilseners out there. It is agressively hopped for the style but that gives it a uniqueness that stands out. Highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Nice sticky lacing throughout. Sparse amount of carbonation present.  S - Clean pilsner nose with plenty of noble hops, some citrus notes and bready malt. There are also some grassy hops and fruity notes with hints of apple, pear and white grapes.  T - Classic pilsner flavor profile with plenty of citrus notes and a clean, grassy hop bite. Malt is predominantly bready.  M - Medium body with lively carbonation and clean, brisk mouthfeel. Finish is moderately bitter and slightly dry with a crisp hop bite that lasts for a while.  D - Sessionable pils with lots of flavor. Very true to style, this brew is definitely a nod to the classic German pilseners that preceded the American craft beer movement.

Two fingers of soft whitish head slowly recede leaving slight lacing. Strong aromas of European hops with a bit of green tea mixed in.  Lots of hop flavor along with citrus (lemon and orange). Nice bitter finish, but doesn't leave any aftertaste. Very clean finish. Feel is smooth and slick, probably from the hop oils. Medium carbonation and light-ish body. Drinkability is also good. Very light and clean, easily sessionable. Great for a hot summer day.

Prima Pils has a plethora of different noble hops thrown into it, and those little leafy things really express themselves in the flavor. This thing is earthy, grassy and spicy as hell, with a solid hop bitterness and a touch of lemon and fruit from the hops. Pilsner malt is in the background and somehow it manages to not be overpowered, although it does take a backseat.  The carbonation is crisp, the body is medium and the mouthfeel is spot-on, as I've come to expect from Victory beers.  Nice and drinkable. I've bought cases of this one on a couple of occasions, and I will generally grab it when I see it on-tap also. This is a stand up pilsner for sure.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Kadonny,4.35,"On tap at the brewery into a Victory pilsener glass. You can't get this any fresher.  A: A medium yellowy straw color with a fluffy white 2 finger head poured. What a pretty beer.  S: A nice sharp nose of hops, grain, grass and some fruity sweetness. The earthy tones come out more as you smell it.  T: Hops, no doubt with hints of grass, lemon zest, grains, a bit of floral flavors and a nice earthy dry bitterness that lingers on. Nice malt backbone that keeps the beer smooth is evident, but not the star here. Clean and crisp, but this beer is all about those nice German style hops.  M: Light to medium with zero alcohol trace and a nice crisp dry bitterness.  D: High, very high. Sit back and enjoy 3 or 4 of these no problem. Very drinkable, very smooth but very bitter just as a good pils should be.  Overall for me hands down this is one of the top pils you can get. Top, top beer.

Crisp lager characteristic with a little bit of a raw graininess to it. the noble hop aroma accompanies it.  Taste. The frist few sips I get just a bitter flavor, but no specific hop taste. As it warms the more distinct noble hop flavor comes out with the bitterness making it a nice crisp flavor. Aftertaste sweetens a bit and gives a grainy maltines.  Mouthfeel. Body is medium, but a little filling for the style. There is still an nice crispness still. Beer has a good amount of carbonation.  Overall, the second half tasted much nicer than the first to me. Ive been waiting to try this beer for some time now, but i think the anticipation got the better of me as I was hoping for more. I liked it, and would enjoy it in the future, but i just thought the flavor would have been more distinct. Abita's 20th anniversary pilsner was a bit better imho. But still a nice beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,mattcrill,4.48,"Aroma: Cracker-like aromas and a bit of sulfur hit first. The sulfur notes quickly fade and the nose is left with spicy, crisp hop notes.  Appearance: Brilliant golden-rod pour with a white cap.  Flavor: More crackers, peppery, and spicy hop notes quickly take charge. A bit of lemon zest as it warms and the palate adjusts. Noble hop flavors abound but this is wonderfully balanced. Finish is very dry.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied with medium-high carbonation. No alochol heat detected.

Minus points for a tiny bit of metallic off flavor M: Solid and full with a nice hop brightness D: Tremendous drinkability.

Lots of bubbles coming from the bottom though.  S - Loaded with spicy hops. A little peppery, a little citrusy, almost a brine like character.  T - Hops come in first with an earthy character. A wonderful burst of grain and semi-sweet malt is followed by a metallic and slightly floral hop finish. Aftertaste is earthy and bitter.  M - Decent carbonation, and thin but not watery.  D - Decent enough but a little intense. Definite potential but not quite what I'm looking for.  I had high hopes for this beer, especially considering other pilsners that I found less than interesting.

345,1010,GilGarp,4,"Pours from a 12oz. bottle very pale with good head and some lingering lacing on the glass.  Aroma is sweet and slightly spicy from the hops.  Taste is overall much better than other american pilsners but comes across a bit strong compared to the german original. As usual, when american companies make european styles, they tend to err on the side of over-doing it with more malt and especially more hop character than would normally be expected.  This is a very drinkable beer with session written all over it. I would love to see a cooler of these at a cookout. A great summer beer.  P.S. - it should be noted that I decided to try this one back-to-back with Odell's Double Pilsner. Perhaps not a fair comparison, looking back, because the DP is bigger and ""badder"" in every way.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Strix,3.85,"Clear pale yellow with a fading head.  Smells bready, with whatever those pilsnery hops are.  Again, the pilsnery hops are prominent. This finishes crisply, and is completely lacking the skunk I have come to associate with most (green bottle) pilsners I've tried. That said, I haven't enjoyed most pilsners I've tried, and if this is the pinnacle, it shows me I'm just not a huge fan of the style.

A great example of a pilsner. This would make an exceptional session beer.  The only time i drink pilsners is in the summer and today is a great example. Temp is pushing 100 and these Primas went down smoothly.  EDIT: Jan. 28 2010.  When i first reviewed Prima Pils i wasn't a huge fan of Pilseners and i don't think i gave a fair review. I purchased a Prima Pils glass from victory and a bomber of fresh Prima today. Let me tell you, if there is a Pilsener thats even close to this one i would love to try it. This really is an amazing beer. So delicate yet flavorful. The head is so fluffy and creamy and leaves gorgeous lacing all the way down the glass!

S: Grassy hops all the way with a earthy slant. Surprisingly sharp in its hop character, there's also a faint herbal touch, with mint present. Hint of toast and biscuit rounds this out with no trace of butteriness that i've found in a depressing number of American lagers.  T: Over the top grassy-earthy and spicy hops. Fantastic. There's the thinnest of malt backbones to this with flavors of toast and biscuit but this is an outright noble hop riot. The finish is long and surprisingly bitter.

Bright Golden in color (I see other people call this Straw colored) the beer was very clear and showed small carbonation bubbles as it sat on the glass.  A wonderful fresh hoppy and grass aroma was easily noted from the beer.  A wonderfully balanced beer with what I note as a slight grape taste as I drink. Not sweet, but just reminds me of this. Also has a great spicy complexity to it.  Biscuity malt that leads to a LONG hop finish. This beer sticks with you.  Mouth feel is wonderful and this is a very drinkable beer.

Crisp hop and delicate malt aroma.  T - Again, classic Pilsner. I like the hop flavor they've got in this, some others can have a bit more of an aggression to their hops that masks the rest of the beer, and others sort of a noticable but sort of wimpy hop characteristic. This is happily in the middle. With a little warming the malt comes out from hiding. A little sweet, a little dank, nothing too crazy.  M/D - Steady carbonation. Light amount of hop bite, just enough resistance as it moves through the mouth, those microscopic compounds within screaming ""taste me! taste me!"".  I hate using the word ""crisp"" given its overuse in marketing from big name beers but this beer's got a lot of crispness to it. That isn't such a bad thing.

This would make a better lawnmower beer than a macro offering.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,PBBC,4.23,"Beer pours incredibly clear... so clear in fact, I had a hard time believing that it could have any flavor.  Aroma.. slightly biscuity, tangy, a tinge of spice... almost like an english ale.  Taste- very clean, but with lingering malt sweetness that coats the tongue... a present, but not overwhelming hop bitterness makes itself known right as the malt sweetness washes away.  Very drinkable, great mouthfeel- much more substantial than one would expect from the color.  Great pilsner... try it once this summer with some spicy food.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,EnojysAnyBeer,4.55,"This is my first Prima Pils poured from a bottle into a pint glass. ""Enjoy by May 11 2008"" Drinking on May 18  A- Very clear golden with a foamy head composed of a wide range of bubbles.  S- Smells like a german pilsner should in my opinion. Very clean hops smell with a backround malt sweetness  T- Taste is great but does not have enough yeast character to please me fully. Carbonation brings out a great bitter hop flavor. Lemon hops and floury biscuit malt  M- Carbonation is EXCELLENT. Balanced range of bubbles makes this beer feel good all over your lips, tongue, mouth, intestines, and more.  D- Drinks quite well. You get what you pay for.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,friesfox5,5,"A- Deep tan, nice carbonation, brief lacing.  S- Ahhh, what a smell. A deep hop aroma, biscuits, grains, mild sweetness. I could smell this beer for hours....but then that would take away from my time drinking it!  T- PERFECTLY balanced malts and hops. The hop spiciness to the finish is not overwhelming but is substantial.  D- I've had many German pilseners and this is as good or better than all of them. This stands up to ones I've had on draft in Germany and Switzerland with no problem at all.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Pretty earthy and grassy to the nose. A little sweetness too.  Sour and hoppy blend into a spicey, intense flavor.  A good, full body for a pilsner. If it weren't so zesty to the palate I would enjoy indulging in more, instead of hitting something else.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

The head sustains throughout as it is continuously replenished by a stream of tiny bubbles. Looks nice.  Nose reveals a touch of malty grain, and a hint of floral grassy hops. Seems clean. Good here as well.  Taste follows the nose with a bit of sweet malt leading to grassy hop and ending with a kiss of sharp spicy bitterness that lingers into the finish.  Mouthfeel seems pretty standard for the style. Thin with lots of tiny bubbles.  This is great beer from a brewery that hasn't disappointed me yet.

Taste- quite spicy in the front end, which quickly dries out into an aspirin like bitterness in the finish. Malt is very clean- a little bready. Carbonation is medium. Its tasty- just seems too harsh for this delicate style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,wiseguy142,3.92,"Pours astonishingly yellow wiht a foamy, sticky wite head. Light carbonation visible. Leaves a messy lacing around the glass.  Smells of sweet German hops.. Tettnang etc. Nice robust aroma that complements the style very well and very noticeable and pleasant.  Taste is a little more bitter than some of the other German Pils I've had. Very light, appley, and tart with hops.  Could use a little more carbonation to lighten up the otherwise very light character of the beer.  The bitterness gets to me in drinking this beer too. Normally Pils is all about balance but this makes it a little off center- not by much though. It's about 90% there. There just seems to be a gap in the final 10% between the crisp, sweet character of the beer and that tiny bit of bitterness where the flavors don't complement each other.  I thought it was interesting to see an American brewery go so gung-ho at a German Pils. I don't think I've had another American brewery's beer that really attempts it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

You can also pick up some malts,sweet fruits and a tingly spicy that is well balanced with mild bitterness. The finish is crispy and dry.The beer itself is lightly carbonated and it has a nice satisfying ending. This one was purchased based on brand reputation and the citizens of Pennsylvania have a lot to be proud of with this brew.  Notes: I am not a fan of the Pilsener,but this will be a staple for summer. This was an experience in that I did not expect to like it so much.

Taste & mouthfeel: Dry and biscuity, the pilsner malt really takes a back seat to the spicy, grassy hop flavors here. Noble hops appear with even greater presence in the finish, biting and crisp with greater bitterness than any German pils I've tried. Body is on the lighter side and carbonation is spot-on for the style. The only thing that this beer is lacking is the clean finish that I commonly associate with a good pils; the oily hops take over the palate and linger for a touch longer than I'd like.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,wanker,2.87,"Pepe La Peu! I thought that I got a skunked sixer until I read several reviews that came to the same conclusion I did -- someone dropped a skunk into this brew.  Dude, where does this overwhelming skunkiness come from? I've never smelled a beer where it was this strong.  Luckily the skunk is less apparent in the taste than the smell. But nevertheless, my second impression of this beer (first being the skunk) was ""I sure don't miss lagers.""  Hate to say it, but to me this one tasted like one part Miller High Life, one part skunk and one part hops.  ...and this from the folks that brought us Storm King! How disappointing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,brewcrew76,3.71,"A - Clear bubbly light straw yellow with a 2 finger head and wispy lacing stuck everywhere in the glass.  S - Pale/pilsner malt with a touch of spicy, floral noble hops and what I refer to as stale lager. Not sure if this stale lager is lager yeast aroma or sulfur or what but it is a aroma/flavor I tend to find in some lagers. The aroma kept switching back and forth from noticeable hops to this sulfur type aroma.  T - Nice sweet pilsner malt backbone with some spicy and floral hops mixed in. I also get the stale lager/sulfer taste mixed in.  M - Light and crisp with the slightest dry finish. Very easy to drink.  D - Everyone talks about how hoppy this beer is but I think Troegs Sunshine or NG Home Town Blond are hoppier versions of German Pilsners. I would still drink a Prima as a nice refresher on a warm summer day.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,Big78CJ,4.8,"This beer looks exactly how a pilsner should. It is a beautiful golden, clear, color with a healthy-looking, white, frothy head. The smell is watery with mild hops and a great herbal barley aroma...rheinheitsgebot? Very simple, clean smelling beer.  Taste: Hoppy and floral. There is a herbal character that does well to balance the malt. The beer tastes full enough to have some complexity but it is likely owing to the biscuity malt. After all, let's not forget Morgan's Canon: parsimony is to be preferred. Perhaps this is just a simple, excellently crafted beer.  M: Slightly more bountiful than most pilsners, likely from the stronger biscuit malts. Very tasty as it is still remarkably clean tasting.  Victory was new to Georgia when I got this beer so it was an intial foray into their offerings. Now I get the Prima on tap at Trappeze. Had Pilsner Urquell not abanbdoned their traditional recipes, they would still remain my top.

S: Smells faintly of citric hops and mostly Euro lager graininess.  T: Not for nothing, but this isn't that great. I was looking for some aggressive hopiness for a pilsner, but instead, got mostly boring pilsner. That said, it was crisp, clean, slightly hopped and thirst quenching, but not what I was hoping for.  M: Mouthfeel is crisp and carbonated; refreshing.  D: It paired well with my citrus vinagrette dressing, but I probably wouldn't get a six pack of it or re-order it by itself.

Flowery hop presence is backed by a biscuity malt aroma that is doughy in character.  The prickly carbonation serves to enhance the hop qualities. The pilsner remains very drinkable and light.

Among the terrific beer selection it had, this gem was for well under $2, a steal by any realistic estimation. A finger of off-white head tops a lemon yellow body, with ample lacing on the Yankees pint glass. The nose is bursting with hops, bready malt, and some sour components, especially lemon and orange peel. The taste is incredible for a Pilsener, full of hops, somewhat grassy, a touch gritty and very bold. This blows away any macro, and can easily hold its own any delicious German offering.

Smell: Floral and herbal spicy hop aromas, with some lemon grass, earthiness, citrus, and with some swirling I keep getting more floral hops, though I can't distinct what's from what. An effervescent and aromatic brew overall, with a lot to admire and much to keep going back for in the nose.  Taste: A huge bouquet of herbal and floral hops, with citrus, a lot of spice, and a finish of floral hops with enough malt backbone to make the finish lingering and long.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with semi-dry finish.  Drinkability: This is certainly a great brew, from a great brewery, and one that's brewed year-round? Am I Pils nut? Not really. But this is a damn fine beer, and I really want to try the staples and the real imports to see how close this is to an actual monolith.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

It certainly looks like a pilsner in the glass, but beyond that, I wouldn't even peg it for a lager, let alone a Pilsener. To me it was much more reminiscent of an IPA or an APA. That being said, it's a great beer in its own right. The palate was somewhat thin and sulfurish, and the nose somewhat sweet, but I'd gladly have more. Nice session beer if they have it on tap. I doubt I'd buy a 6-pack, though.  When I want an American-made Pilsenser, I think I'll stick to Trumer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Memories of mowing the lawn from this one.  Taste: One smooth beer. The hops are strong for the style but not overpowering. Faint malt presence. Good hop bitterness. Spicy fading to grassy/floral. The malt remains faint throughout, but never fades completely and compliments the hops well. Just a hint of sweetness just before the dry finish.  Mouthfeel: The bubbling glass made me worry about the carbonation, but it was spot-on when drinking. Very light in the mouth, but just chewy enough.  Drinkability: This is probably my favorite session beer, and is always in my fridge.

S: Pretty much average by all accounts.  T: Light flavor balance that finished toward the dry side. The finish is relatively quick with the slightest hint of lingering bitterness.  M&D: Light carbonation, taste, and good flavor balance make this brew smooth and enjoyable. It goes down easy and isn't very filling.

Starts light, blossoms into a mellow hoppiness, then ends with a nice grainy aftertaste. Not the boldest flavors, but it travels well.  M: Light-bodied. Slight touch of carbonation.

Some good sweetness from the malt, a bit of DMS in the background, and a big burst of noble hops.  Weak honey-like sweetness in the beginning, then finishes with a big hop slam. Seems like here, as in the aroma, the hops just may be a bit too much for the style. I'm a hop-head, though, so I don't mind.  Medium-high carbonation, very crisp and drying. Great example of the style.  Seems a bit too hoppy for the style, but I like hops, so I can forgive. Great summer weather beer for hop heads that want something light and crisp.

The finish maintains this raw hop bitterness and introduces a sweeter malt flavor, perhaps honey-like. Some lemon zest on the sides of the tongue.

Aroma is hugely hoppy, with notes of green grass, some apple, and hints of alcohol. On subsequent sniffs, malt sneaks in as an afterthought. Flavor is hoppy upfront, with lots of noble character, backed by a significant malt backbone and a nice medium body to support the strength of the flavor profile.

Pilseners aren't necessarily made for looks, I would say, but it fits the style well.  Smell: Grainy malt, with some slight banana and apple. Some bittering hops on the back end. Very clean, very nice.  Taste: Nice barley grain, slightly toasted up front. Citric and bittering hops. Slight fruit flavors.

Oddly, there's a slightly sour malt odor that just tarnishes the scent somewhat.  Refreshingly sharp, grassy start flows into a sturdy malt body with a bit of an astringent finish. A touch metallic on the aftertaste seems about right for the style.  Mouthfeel is full but never thick. Hops grow to provide a bracing finish.

345,1010,SMark,3.62,This beer was poured into an Imperial pint glass from a 12 ounce brown bottle at 42º. A fluffy pillow like white head resulted with minimal lacing as the head dissipated. The beer was hazy and pale yellow in color with a moderate amount of carbonation. No date information was discovered on the bottle.  Hops were the predominant bouquet. The aroma was clean and refreshing which invited that first taste.  The taste was a nice balance of the hops and malt with a slight dryness to the taste. Not a clean and crisp taste but a more subtle pilsner with flavor. This is what a mass produced beer should taste like.  Tastes linger long enough to clue you in that this is a well made pilsner. This is a good marriage of the ingredients.  Lacing lasted into the final sips. Haziness stayed throughout and flavors showed a softer side as the beer warmed.

Mouthfeel is equally good and this makes for a very drinkable brew... My second beer by the Victory company, and I continue to be impressed...

Has a strong, appealing smell of fresh cut grass and flowers. Taste is hoppy for a pilsner, but not excessively so, with a fine malt to balance it. A heavier mouthfeel than your average pilsner, with none of the ""watery"" body that plagues some pilsners.

Victory has put forth a whopper of a pilsner, true to the style--save for the appearance--with the panache that Victory is known for.  Pours a golden yellow with an odd haze you wouldn't expect in a style known for its clarity. The carbonation is there, with a nice head at the pour and a ring around the glass that's typical. Hops hit the stage first, joined shortly for a duet with the grassy malts that end up stealing the show.  The fluid flow is sharp with carbonation, but not too much, and slides down easy. Nice, sharp finish... no real aftertaste except for a little bitterness that lingers on the sides of your tongue.  Overall a solid pilsner.

It does have that slightly skunky smell that is anticipated in the style.  Taste is good and better than most pilsners out there. A bit of malt and a bitter, slightly spicey finish.

Mouthfeel: It is fizzy but not sharp. It has a dry feeling from hop bitterness, accompanied by a medium body from malts.  Drinkability: I could have a few more, easy.

The flavour starts out flowery, and gives way to a solid biscuity middle. The floral aspects hang out on the back of the tongue, adding some depth without taking over. Slightly astringent on the finish, but overall solid taste.  The mouth on this is about what one would expect, not very thick, some hop action but not a tonne. The drinkability is also par for the course, I would have given it a bit more love here but for the finish.  The bottom line: Victory has put together a solid take on the style. This would easily be up into the 4.0 range if the finish was better though, as the front and middle segments of the taste are easily in that rating category for the class.

345,1010,kenito799,4.52,"12oz bottle poured into a pilsener glass. Best before date: Nov 13. 2007. Fresh from a closed case, no light exposure.  Clear golden color with fluffy white head that recedes and leaves wisps of lace as it is drunk.  Aroma is yeasty (like champagne), floral-hoppy, malty, fresh, deliciously beer-y.  Flavor is wonderfully crisp with perfectly balanced hop bitterness (very different kind of bitterness than the hops in an IPA) from start to finish, with smooth malt all the way through. Very refreshing and supremely drinkable and thirst-quenching. Exactly what I want on a hot day.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ncvbc,4.27,"Pour was clear and golden. Big and bubbly carbonation and a thin white head.  Smell was of fresh hops. A biscuity malt as well. Light spices round this off.  Taste of light grassy hops. Earthy and a slight malt tartness to it also.  Mouthfeel was very crisp and clean. A little dry in the end with a tingle on the tongue. Quite refreshing and the high point for me.  I certainly enjoyed this beer and could drink many. Not sure why I haven't purchased it before, not the biggest Pilsener fan I guess. The bottle confirms what I thought of this on-tap. Good stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jkrich,4.53,"12 oz. bottle with ""enjoy by"" date 12/12/07 which indicates this is a fresh beer. Purchased at Jungle Jim's in Fairfield, OH.  Poured a light, clear, golden color with a persistent white head into a pilsner flute.  Open opening bottle could detect the flowery hop aroma of the European hops typical of a fresh pilsner.  Initial taste of pleasant hop bitterness followed by a slight malty sweetness - a well rounded mouthful. The sweetness reminds me more of a Czech pilsner than a German interpretation. Either way, this is a sophisticated, elegant pilsner  Excellent session beer to enjoy any time of the year. I am always impressed with a brewery that attempts and succeeds at brewing a world class pilsner as this is a very difficult style to brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Crotor,4,"I've long thought that the east coasters just don't know how to do a proper IPA. And yes, I've had Hop Devil and DFH's ""minute"" offerings... But this doesn't mean the east-coasters don't know how to do a *hoppy* beer - behold, Prima Pils!  Pours an incradibly light gold - perhaps the lightest I've ever seen in a craft beer. Pushed up one finger of lingering head. Marks for appearance would be higher if the beer were clearer...  The aroma is all clean, noble hops. And would I be crazy if I said I smelled a hint of tropical fruit too? Whatever the case, it smells damn good.  Assertively hoppy in the mouth, and all with the strange and somewhat unfamiliary (to the American drinker, that is, due to their under-utilization) flavor of noble hops. The malt stays back, but it has the appropriate pilsner malt profile... I'm glad to let the hops do their thing. Damned tasty.  Lively in the mouth and damned drinkable. It's just so refreshing to have a beer *this* hoppy, but NOT using the PNW-alpha/citrus monsters. Too bad this is so difficult to find on the west coast...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,macster,3.87,"Pours a straw yellow color producing a thin white head which fades quickly to a paisley patterned thin film.  Clean, pleasant aromas of lemon zest, flowers, fresh baked biscuits, cut hay and herbs come to mind.  Palate is a bit thin, light and watery; but a shows off a lively carbonation.  Taste is surprisingly quite hoppy for a Pilsener. Herbs and spices make a strong presence here with a moderate bitterness. A subdued honey-bread, lemon candy sweetness follows up in the background. A bit on the light side, but clean and refreshing nonetheless.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,nickfl,4.49,"A - Slightly hazy golden liquid, topped with a finger and a half of white head. Good retention and lace.  S - Grainy and sweet with a slight hoppy note in the background. Distinct German pilsner aroma that I can only describe as corn tortillas.  T - Grainy with lots of herbal hop flavor. Sweet at first, but it finishes dry and smooth.  M - Moderately high carbonation, light body and a somewhat astringent finish.  D - This is by far the most authentic German pilsner that I have had from an American brewery. The flavor and aroma are spot on and I am amazed that they would take the time to craft something this subtle. Stylistically, the only flaw is the somewhat poor clarity. German pilsner is by no means one of my favorite styles, but Prima is beautifully done.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,MICAMD,4.35,"A- A slightly cloudy golden liquid fills the glass. A thick white head forms and maintains itself for quite some time but settles to a thin covering after some minutes. The streaming lines of carbonation rising to the top look amazing. Leaves some good lacing as it works its way down the glass.  S- Pretty complex for the style. Some straw, grass, and some punget hops. There is no real ""skunky"" aspect to the beer, amazing.  T- Hops and some biscuity malt. Sweet up front and a little sour on the finish. Maybe a little bit of tea essence to this. The hops are pretty grassy- which I love.  M- A little dry, and the carbonation is spot on. Everything seems to be hitting on all cylinders here.  D- A very impressive Pilsener- the best I have yet to try in fact. I will have to start keeping this around.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Budro,4.13,"Inspired by the recent forum discussion of Victory's availability in GA, I picked up a six-pack of this on Saturday, after I'd consented to the idea of saving some dough and contenting myself this weekend with the suprlus white wine my mother-in-law sent home with me after my father-in-law's 60th birthday bash. Ah, well. Rational economic analysis be damned. I'm a Beer Advocate! I poured the bottle into a pilsner glass.  A: This is a strikingly beautiful beer, boasting a white foamy head you could shave with. This settles quickly, retaining thinly across the surface, topping a brew of pale golden yellow that evokes yellow hay in the morning light where the light catches it, homemade lemonade at the base, and everywhere else banana--not the peel, but the fruit itself.  S: Sweetness as from distant hay, freshly mown. That's right: distant hay, freshly mown. Hop aromas, pungent and sour, emerge as well, as if carried on gentle breeze.  T: All hops, subdued. (Tamed?) Intense but not overpowering sourness tops the foundation's picnic-blanket shake of bitterness. The malt doesn't contribute much to the flavor, but perhaps in the underlying mellowness, its presence is accounted for. The aftertaste evokes sharp cheddar cheese, but again, faintly.  M: Thin but not weak. Drenches the palate, which takes a nice long time to dry between swallows.  D: Light and perfectly drinkinable. None of that heavy-belly feeling.  I really grew to appreciate this beer over the life of the six-pack. This beer makes a subtle first impression, but repeated exposure yields rewards.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,dgallina,4.39,"12 ounce bottle dated best-before October 2007  Pours pale and slightly hazy yellow with a little head, reasonable lace. Great aroma; lots of fresh cut grass, honey, and mint. The flavor is fabulous too. Very clean honey, fresh mint, and grass notes on the front. Finishes with bitter hop and lingering mint notes. Body is crisp, light, with nice carbonation. A fantastic pils!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BBM,4.3,"This beer poured a dull, clear yellow into a pint glass. Not too bright, like many other pils I have seen, but this is a good thing in my opinion. A sudsy white head rest atop the brew. The aroma was grassy, earthy, and just a tad sweet.  This is a fantastically different and exciting pilsener. There is an unexpected, sharp bitter herbal hop flavor up front, along with some citrus and grassy characteristics. The malt backbone the exposes itself as being full-flavored and without a hint of skunkiness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, and carbonated enough to keep it excitable on the palate.  This is a highly drinkable pilsener, and one of my favorites I've ever tried. I would wholly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a very fine pils. Good job, Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,williamherbert,4.27,"The color is a light, yellow straw-color. Very clear, but with a fluffy white head. Decent carbonation. Slightly above average-looking for a pilsner.  Smell is a nice combination of some sweet biscuity malt and a hint of wheat. An unusual hop presence; I'm shocked there is any at all! Rich, sweet smell for a lighter beer.  Bitter German malt flavor is actually delicious. Combines bitterness with a sweet, flowery malt as well. Some nice wheat, even a hint of berry. Hops are light, but they are there. Really rich compared to most pilsners.  Feel is bitter on the tongue. Thick for a pilsner, and a bit sandpapery. Still, a clean finish; bitter feel but no film. Fizzy as it warms. It's a lighter beer with some body and rich flavor. Big-time repeater for sure.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,OWSLEY069,3.61,"Pours a clean yellow with a small white head that goes away quickly. A sweet european hop aroma is there. In the taste, a dry pils and a nice hop charcteristic.

I'm not getting much of the Saaz hops that everyone else speaks of. Aftertaste does not linger as long as preferred. Pilsners certainly have their place in my fridge, but this one isn't standing out for me sadly.

It has a light golden straw-like color with a decent head that is well retained and settles into 'chunky', foamy pieces. The aroma is malty and grainy with traces of noble hops. The flavor is malty (triple decoction?) with noble hops present. It has a nice balanced flavor with a hoppy finish. It has a medium-light body with moderate carbonation to it.  Overall, this is a really tasty pilsner. You could have really put this past me as being made in Germany. For an American brewery, this is an outstanding pils. That said, it stands up to the pilsners of Europe, but I would like a tad more hops in the aroma for perfection. However, this might be solely a function of the freshness. I bet this is fantastic at the brewery from the tap! This is another great beer from Victory, my compliments.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Very clean looking pils, with great clarity, nice white frothy head that laced nicely on the glass. Smell of medium roasted malts and slight hoppy notes of pine or citrus. Taste was very good for this pilsner, with decent malt back balanced by a mild hop infusion. Mouthfeel was decent as well, although it could have been better. Good, good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

It has that grainy pilsner taste, but goes down fairly smooth. Has a bit more hop flavor than most pilsners, but overall the taste is pretty smooth. Not the best Victory has to offer, but you'd be hard pressed to find a better pilsner. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I was hoping, but I think it's just because I don't like that grainy pilsnery taste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

I poured this beer into a pilsner glass it poured a beautiful golden color that left a thin white head on top. The body is clear, clean, and left only carbonated bubbles in the glass. The aroma is straw, hay, grass, earthy rustic peppery hops that really make this pilsner enjoyable. The taste is crisp, refreshing, balanced bitter bite with a lemon and honey fruitiness to the beer.

345,1010,Tomas77,4.1,This one was served a light straw gold with a small but dense head of foam. Lace formed nicely on the sides of the glass.  Malts had some buiscuty aromas and flavors but mostly hops were present but not overpowering at all. Good balance. I did get the spicy/peppery/some floral notes in the nose and on the palate typical of german style pilsners. Dry and a little bitter in the finish. Not watery at all as one might think when looking at it in a glass.  High drinkability rating. Very refreshing. Great beer for warm summer days. Quaffable for sure.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Pours a light yellow into a pilsener glass with fair head that dissipates fairly quickly. Just a slight bit of lace remains on the glass.  Aromas are not that strong. Slightly hoppy, slightly sweet. A bit like cut grass.  Flavor definitely had a bitter bite to it, which I guess is characteristic of this style of beer. Didn't taste a lot of other flavors, though and it was quite one dimensional. Almost a bit waxy as well.  Mouthfeel was fairly light, but there was a bitter aftertaste that lingered longer than I cared for.

Rather pleasant, though, if not all that complex.  Taste: Quite nice for a pilsner, a style that I usually dont prefer but might grow into with this beer. Kinda tangy in the middle, and bitter towards the end, but it fades slightly into a maltier aftertaste. I also tasted some piney hops along the way. Refreshingly bubbly, too.  Drinkability: Pretty good, especially on a hot day. I can see myself having a couple of these for refreshment.

T-Very crisp tasting beer. The hops are very strong here, a grassy, spicy noble taste. The bitterness cuts through everything here and leaves a nice bitterness behind. I would say the malt plays second fiddle here but as it warms the sweetness comes out more leaving a wonderful balance. I am also getting a little mineral taste as well.  M-Crisp, light body, great on a warm summer day.  D- This is hoppier than most pilseners and I generally dont get the noble hops in these quantities. This is however right up my alley.

If you don't like pilsners but want to try something new, start with this one. Everything about this beer is good. Could easily satisfy any hophead's craving for hops, while not scaring away even the most devout BMC drinker.  Poured a 12oz. bottle into a pilsner glass.  Appearance - Clear golden straw in color. 2+ finger foamy head that left lots of lacing.  Smell - Grassy, floral, herby, and hoppy.  Taste - The slight sweetness from the malt comes in at the beginning and immediately takes a backseat to the lemony hops - like a very hoppy lager. Very crisp yet smooth.  Mouthfeel - Crisp and prickly from the fairly high carbonation level. Light bodied with a dry finish.  Drinkability - Excellent - goes down smooth. With its low ABV it is easily sessionable.  People say it is great outside on a hot day, I would argue it is equally good indoors on a hot day with the A/C on full blast. Good anytime brew.

A - Looks like a commercial (not a commercial beer, but like the beautiful shot that they set up in a studio.). Clear with 3 fingers of white heads leaves a little white lacing as it dissipates. Visible and active carbonation throughout.    S - Rich noble hops give it a clean, fresh hay-like character. Quite refreshing, dry scent.  T - Not my style of choice, but this is good. Very dry. Opens slightly sweet, but ends very dry with a fresh, noble hops flavor that reminds me of freshly cut grass.  M - Did I mention Dryness yet? It's got some active carbonation that makes it quite active as well.  D - A very nice beer, it's dryness may be a slight detriment to drinkability in some situations, but it's still quite enjoyable and quite drinkable.  Overall, I'm pretty impressed. It probably won't become a session beer for me, but on a nice day in a hammock, I'd enjoy it.

The head is modest but holds throughout with good lacing, very solid head. The aroma is pretty faint, just a bit of mild hops perhaps, not sure. The flavor is also very mild, not as definitive as say an Urquel or other European favorites. More of a wheat quality to the taste, a suggestion of lemon. No skunkiness here. Fairly light and crispy with a slightly creamy feel that delivers the flavor. Clearly a quality brew but I would prefer a little more flavor in this recipe to fully deliver.

M - Maybe slightly over carbonated, the hops leave one's mouth very dry.  D - Easy to drink, goes down well, hops might make it fall slightly.  Who would have thought? A pils with hops?

The beer came out pale, pale yellow with a small head that lasted the whole time, though it left no noticeable lacing. Mild is the best way to describe the smell, with light malt and grassy hops. It felt just like a pilsner, at least my idea of one, should feel, with prickling carbonation and refreshing crispness.

S- Lemony characteristics lie over a slightly spicy pale maltiness, reminscent of white wheat bread.  T- Bitter lemon and grapefruit balance out light bready flavor that I found to be somewhat weak.

And I'll be damned if there isn't a hint of soap in the mid sniff. Enticing.  T - what I imagine Pilsners should be. Starts with a light sweetness balancing the initial bitterness. Really, the perfectly lagered yeasts come to the forefront midway through this brew as well, and really show it's roots.  M - style on medium body that leaves you anting, without needing another.  D - if this is your style, this is one of the best, and at 5.3%, not a problem. No overly lengthy aftertaste to prevent the next sip from being wanted, just crisp and authentic for the style.

T: Big flavors of grassy, herbal hops...just like the smell. Some light, biscuity malt sweetness is tasted by mid sip. Finishes clean, crisp, and dry. This one's all about the hops.  M: Light bodied and crisp. However, I would have preferred a slightly grainier feeling brew...more carbonation perhaps? I should stress SLIGHTLY grainier.  D: One of the best beers I've had. I'd like to pair this with a wide variety of foods. It's also excellent on its own, especially during a hot, humid day. Who would have thought a pilsener could have so much flavor?

Smells clean and malty, like a proper German pilsner should, right? Right. You can tell just from smelling this puppy that you're not getting another macro-processed American pilsner-style lager. No corn in this guy. The malt is the dominant aroma here, but there are faint notes of cut grass and old shoe leather as well. Not much fruit that I can sense, although at times there are also faint lemony scents as well. The taste is malty goodness as well, but with a very pleasant hop kick in the finish. Very well balanced, with some subtle buttery flavor as well. And that mouthfeel? Smooth. Almost chewy, but clean and crisp all at the same time. A heckuva a pils for this side of the pond, no doubt.

The head is a good 1/4 when poured and quickly settles to a decent sized ring along the inside of the glass and an decent surface layer that leaves okay lacing. Aromas of malt and hops are there and not really much else. The taste is again of hops and malt and not much else, maybe a hint of vegetables. Good balance. The hop bitterness certainly becomes more dominant as the beer starts to warm. I thought the beer was surprisingly hoppy for its style.

I don't know if I poured this just right, or if all Prima Pils pours up in this manner, but this has a magnificent appearance! Big, soapy, snow white foamy head that remained in place for several minutes while tiny streams of CO2 bubbles streamed upward. Tilting the glass leaves nice lacing around the edges of the glass. Again, I don't know if I poured this just right, or if they all look this way, but this looked like it belonged in an ad. Smell was mild, but defined. In other words, there was a handful of nice smells that were both expected and identifiable, but they weren't obscene or assertive like ""background music"" played too loudly. This was pleasant and enjoyable with its mildly spicy hops and ""gently sweet"" malt. A session beer for sure. I could drink several of these. Especially with its pleasantly bitter finish.

345,1010,Beertron,4.52,"After a two-week long ice-breaking, finally sat down to review this sucker. It's tough to review when you have so much hype. Nevertheless, from bottle to pint...  A - Top shot off like a gun when treated to the usual lighter technique. Poured soft and golden with strong carbonation. Head is beautiful bright white and huge, slowly dissipating one large bubble at a time with strong, thick laces.  S - Hops. Lightly piny/evergreen scented, with the floral side of hops taking front and center. Deeper whiffs give a strong earthiness -- spring leaves and mushrooms. Wonderful, intriguing nose, though slightly masked.  T - Man oh man. What a champ. There's so much under-the-radar going on in this beer, I'm not even sure where to start. There's' a light, soft malty sweetness in the forefront, akin to croissants or other light, buttery bread. This is followed by a prominent tinge of hops. They're light, bright and pleasant -- not excessively bitter -- but certainly strong enough to make their presence known. Following the hops is a blast of yeast -- almost a dead ringer for the dry active yeast often used in bread baking (at least in this country). Finally, as the hops show back up for the drying affect, one can detect a salty note along with an earthy acidity that reflects both tea and bile (the latter here not being nearly as disgusting as it sounds).  M - It's obviously on the lighter side of things, but this has a bit more body than a lot of pils and this is a good thing. This beer is just fun -- it quenches, then dries; pretty much begging for another drink to quench, then dry all over again.  D - Huge. I'm not sure what the ABV is here, but I can guarantee you that if it's high, I wouldn't know it until too late. I bet I could drink a sixer of this in less than two hours if I had the time to play. This beer is addictive. Is there crack in here?!?  F - Again, where to start? This brew loves food. So long as one stays on the lighter side of the spectrum, there's probably little that this wouldn't go well with. For what its worth, here are the things that jumped out at me as solid matches: lighter whole grains (quinoa, oats, brown rice), mild artisan cheeses and the softer side of wild mushrooms (chanterelles, honey mushrooms, or, even morels -- but keep it away from ultra deep-flavored mushies like black trumpets, hen 'o the woods or porcinis). This beer's overall profile fits like a good croissant or english muffin so both bacon and eggs seem like they would work well here. You want a beer for breakfast? This is your friend.  O - It's hard to imagine being more impressed. This brew has it all. It's light and quenching but hoppy and dry. It has an uncharacteristic complexity that gives an often rare start, body and finish to it, but it's also incredibly well-balanced and no one component goes over the top. In addition, it wants to be consumed with food. Wow. This beer lives up to the hype and then some. A new standard.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

There are some tastes I can't describe... no off notes at all, excellent.  Mouthfeel is full, pillowy and soft. Light bodied, but the hops on the finish add a feeling of stickiness. Just right.

Lemon and citric hop notes are the most obvious aromas, with a light Pilsener malt backing and mild floral hop tones. The first sip is full of pale malt sweetness and sharp pilsener malt. Exhibits a clean lager profile, free from any noticeable off-flavors or yeast by-products. Aftertaste is struck with lemon/orange flavored alpha oils and a background floral Hallertau taste. Solid bitterness is balancing but not aggressive. Med-light mouthfeel with a gentle but crisp carbonation that allows a refreshing and effervescent mouthfeel, yet does not drown out the subtle malt and hop character with too much fizz.

Light and flowery noble hop aromas, slightly earthy. Nutty malt sweetness as well, and a bit of apple blossom.  Taste is, wow....unexpected. This is extremely tasty! The hop character is so pronounced and unique and unlike anything I've had. Hop character is decidedly herbal and a little piney too, with a bit of floral grassiness. Crisp crackery malt character as well, slight nuttiness in the background. Body is light and finishes welcomingly dry. This an exceptional example of a pilsener, and drinkable all night long.

The palate features a nice balance between a sharp though not overly astringent hop bite (with a mostly leafy, grassy character thought theres a nice touch of citrus as well) and a fairly sweet but very smooth biscuity/bready malt base. Piney hops in the lengthy, bitter finish.  Most definitely one of the best examples of the American double pilsner style.

A little harsh on the hops and very light on the malt. Although this isnt my favorite style of beer, this is a hell of a pils.

345,1010,Metalmonk,4.02,"Pours a fluffy head made of large bubbles, with an army of bubbles marching up the glass. Color is a light yellow with good clarity.  There's a real fine line between this kind of aroma evoking fresh, flowery hops and lightly sweet malts...or smelling like a crappy light macro pils. This is clearly made with some love, as the aroma is in the former category: clean, sharp, earthy.  Tastes true to style; grainy/bready earthiness followed by a peppery hops crispness and syrupy sweet-corn element. Finishes clean and crisp, a dryness only coming after an initial sweet stickiness has its way with the tongue.  Mouthfeel isn't overbearing, but it is somewhat dominant. Has all the crispness and zing you'd want from the style.  If you need a change from the big dark extreme beasts, this one would be a really good choice. If you just want a great American-made pils, something actually made with some pride, again this is a great pick. And for sessioning, this works too.

Straw colored. Lots of hop bite in the nose, with a big pilsner blast including DMS. To sum it up, great smelling and great looking.  Although this one isn't exactly fresh, I feel like I can do a pretty accurate review because I used to drink it all the time. Gotta love that big hop presence...it almost dominates the beer with very aromatic and pleasantly bitter nobles. Malts play a key role by adding a big but gentle grainy, grassy body. Lager yeast profile is simply defined by this beer. Notes of black pepper and green onion.  The carbonation may be a bit much in this case. It adds a lot of spiciness, but I feel it overwhelms the mouthfeel and brings on a soda-pop vibe that goes up your nose. Otherwise, it's a light, refreshing, highly drinkable beverage.  One of the hoppiest pilsners out there. Highy recommended. Think of it as an artistically brewed Miller Lite with quality ingredients and a caring hand.

345,1010,prototypic,3.83,"Appearance: Pours a clear golden to yellow color. One finger head with good retention and light lacing. Much more enticing than your typical macro.  Smell: It has an earthy-grassy type aroma. Hops are certainly there. There's a hint of citrus and malt on the tail end.  Taste: Very crisp and refreshing. I'd love to have some on a really hot day. It has nice bitter taste to it with just the right bit of malt in there. Citrus flavors (mostly lemon) really round out this beer.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied and very smooth. ABV is perfect. Highly drinkable, especially in warm weather. Overall, this is a good beer. It's everything that I wish the American macros could be.

It starts with a good bit of carbonation, that dies to a nice bubble from the bottom action. The taste is very clean. Its incredibly smooth with hints of hoppyness and a little sweetness. The hops come in more on the finish. It has a nice light to medium mouthfeel that is very smooth and pleasant. Very drinkable due to its crisp light yet flavorful body.

Smell is crisp, slight piney and grassy hops, and a very faint malt sweetness.  Taste is very light and crisp, with a surprisingly strong hop character and bitterness.  Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I might prefer, but it fits the style well.  Drinkability is very good, the lighter flavor and appearance make it exceedingly easy to drink.  Overall a very good example of a Pilsner.

345,1010,AltBock,3.89,"12 oz. bottle with a dark wintergreen label that has a detailed drawing of a giant hop bud right in the middle of the label. Around the hop bud, Victory says it's ""a refined Pilsner beer and it's for natural enjoyment."" To the left of the hop bud is a large paragraph talking about the Pilsner style and information about the beer itself. To the right of the hop bud is the barcode and Government warning. Usually Victory stamps their beer with a best before date in between the picture and the large paragraph, but they must have forgot to stamp mine because there isn't a date anywhere. That's OK, Victory can't possibly remember to date all of their bottles. Poured into a Pilsner glass (Duh!).  Prima Pils poured a very bubbly pale lemon yellow color with a cloud like 1 finger head of white fluffy foam. It had excellent retention. It lasted the entire duration of the beer's life in my glass and whenever the beer lowered, the head of foam left behind tons of white sticky lace around the glass. It had a subtle aroma of malted grass, peppery hops, a touch of grapefruit, and just the slightest hint of toasted malts at the end. The taste was clean and refreshing with citrus and herbal hops, a dash of pepper, a dab of dried grapefruit, and just the slightest hint of toasted malts in the background. The mouthfeel was light and not too dry with a mild aftertaste bite of dried citrus fruits and herbal hops. Another winner from Victory Brewing. This could definitely make an excellent choice for a summer session beer or any season for that matter. I should also say thanks to fellow BA HoboAGoGo for pointing out this beer to me.

The hops have a distinct bitterness to them, almost sour, and very delicious and refreshing. Also to be found are some hints of grain, pleasantly and mildy malted, as well as some peppery spice in there.

The medium high carbonation allows some smoothness in the mouthfeel and follows with some cloying. Bitterness is right up front with its sharp hop profile and ends dry with a peppery hotness. Grainy, grassy, corn sugar sweetness rounds this out and just a little musty earthiness brings the flavors together.

Lace sticks quite well throughout the entire beer but it isn't that thick. Smell is of mild hops with a fair amount of a malty wheat-like aroma paired with a flowery odor. Very light refreshing taste with mild earthy/herb like tone that is perfect for a warm summer day. This brew is very smooth and well balanced over all which makes it extremely drinkable.

345,1010,alexskovan,3,"Poured a cloudy dishwatery yellow, with a thin head that dropped quickly. Aroma is big on the grapefruity hoppyness that is all the rage these days among ""quality"" American beers. (Are the Europeans still mocking our beer for tasting like water, or do they now sneer at it because it tastes like grapefruits? Not that I CARE, mind you, what the good people of Euro-Land think about my great country. But still, I do hope that this insecure need to hop the hell out of our beer in order to compensate for Macro will go away soon.)  Taste is ok, not the punch of hops that I was expecting, but still not right for a beer that calls itself a Pilsener.  This beer is not the WORST abuse of the style that I've ever tasted from a micro -- and of course, it is much better than a macro. But to call it a Pilsener -- no. Sorry. No.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

I up ended my bottle on the pour and had a good finger of head.  Smell, a rounded malty aroma with hints of floral, quite fragrant with a little zip to it.  Taste was like light biscuits and bread mixed with a little nuts and some mellow hops to round it out. A little racey and i like it. Fresh on the palate with a good crispiness.

The colour is a brilliant pale with limited crown and a light carbonation...the body appears to be thin or watery. However, this is a nicely balanced beer with a slight advantage to the hops to end. The expierience I recieve from this pilsner is of a fruit mash&gt; pear, lemon a touch of corn. At first I thought I detected the aroma of corn, if so it quickly left never to return leaving a light floral scent in its wake. Very pleasing. The appearance of a thin body holds true.

Poured a huge head from a lousy self-pour into a tall narrow glass mug. I love seeing the lacing that forms. Truly a beautiful beer to look at.  I've never noticed much of a smell from this beer. If anything it just smells clean and fresh like summer.  This beer is awesome because its good by itself or with most any food. It has crispness and palate cleansing properties. Yet it also has some very good hop qualities. I enjoy the citrusy notes.  I can drink just one in a session or 2 with a meal and would drink several of these if they weren't so pricey.

345,1010,BeerBelcher,3.9,"This beer is very good. It tastes much like a good Bohemian Pilsner, like a Pilsner Urquell or a Czechvar.  It pours a pale, dull, yellow with decent head formation which dissipates quickly but leaves good lacing. At first I was afraid I smelled a bit of skunkiness, but I believe that was just generous amounts of Saaz hops. Flavor is fairly light, but definitely ""European"" in character. At first I thought it didn't taste like much, but as I drank it, significant pleasant bitterness accumulated in my mouth. Mouthfeel is light, but not insubstantial. This beer is extremely drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,dbalsock,3.67,"App: Poured a standard light pale amber color with good head. There was no lacing, and the head retention was better than average for american made pilseners, i'm sure. Most tend to fizzle out eventually, but this stayed around with ample carbonation.  Smell: A nice conglomeration of german hops comes through on the nose. More intense than the imported varieties, this beer really brought the hops to life.  Taste: I found the hops even more intense on the palate than on the nose, which actually detracted a little from the nice light malt that I knew was there. It was a tad unbalanced, or at least not balanced in the direction I was hoping for.  Mouthfeel: I usually don't expect much from pilseners in the mouthfeel category except crisp, refreshing and a slight bite on the aftertaste, but this had a more notable bitterness, as well as more intense carbonation than usual. It was still somewhat crisp, but more rounded out by other sensations.  Drinkability: I wouldn't session this beer as I would other pilsners, because it seems a little more intricate and little bit more thinking about. It's more of artisinal pilsener, and that's a rare find, but it's not what I want when going for the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

On to the beer:  It's German styled alright, but with an American twist to it. What are American craft brewers known for? Making hoppy beers. Take a standard German Pils, and make it a pinch hoppier. It's a bit grassy and spicy with lingering bready malts following each sip. I expected it to be sweeter than it tasted, as the smell had an appealing sticky sweet scent to it. Very German in character, but don't tell my German stange glass that it was brewed in America.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,geexploitation,4.62,"Pours bright gold with perfect clarity and a sticky but thin white head that leaves lacing and a collar. Familiar sea-air Saaz hop aroma, very fragrant and volatile. Nice graininess underneath. On the palate, rough hops are at the forefront -- not rough like a bronco, but rough like fine-grained sandpaper. Light barley malt backing on the palate, which provides some smoothness to the beer without being overly creamy or thick. Mouthfeel is light in weight but scratchy with hops. Overall, this is a wonderful pils -- it's got all the hallmarks of the style, but it's also got an American edge in that it's drier and hoppier than most Euro examples. But it's not overdone; it maintains its sessionability. Excellent.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Hops kick in with authority; slightly biting, herbal tasting with just a touch of lemon zest.  Body: Crisp is the name of the game here; nicely carbonated, light in body, substantial drying from the hops, lingering bitterness.

The aroma is nice and grassy, its sweet and fruity too, along with a nice hop presence. Yum!  Taste is quite grassy and floral as well, along with a nice sweetness that comes through before the hops in the swallow. Quite hoppy, but very tasty. Probably my favorite American pilsener.  Mouthfeel is good, not too light, crisp and slightly drying. The hoppiness, without excessive bitterness, from the flavor just won't quit, and thats a good thing.

Taste is very pleasant, with initial malty carbonated feeling followed by notable bitterness, which fades into the finish slowly.

Appearance was a lighter golden with a pretty full white head that disappeared and left no signs of existance shortly after. Looks like what you would expect from a traditional pilsner.  Smell was pretty appetizing. It's like smelling a regular old pilsner but with cunning malt and hop character.  Taste was delicious. It just seemed like it was holding back compared to the pint I had on tap. If I were reviewing the draft, I would have given it a 5, but the bottled version fell short of anything above good.  Mouthfeel was exciting and adequately carbonated.  Drinkability from the bottle was one aspect that beat the draft.

At the apex the head was three fingers tall. Impressive head retention, the bubbles slowly subsided to a modest cap. The subsequent lacing was unorganized and sporadic. This is an attractive beer.  The legend of Prima Pils doesnt live up to the hype at least based on what I smell. Sure, the nose is pleasantly hoppy, spicy, earthy, grassy, and zesty with some citrus notes. Not much malts, I am surprised. Maybe (and I mean maybe) I detect some cracker aromas. It is lightly fruity in the background. Moderate potency, it is a charmingly hoppy Pils; what more can I ask for.  The palate is quite enjoyable. Flowery, grassy, citrus and zesty hoppiness. Fairly bitter, it hits me at the back of the throat. Im impressed with the concentrated hop flavors. The palate is tangy in the middle, fruity minimal malt backbone. This is a tasty Pils. I like it but I would like a fuller flavor profile.  Medium in body, light carbonation, creamy mouthfeel; I prefer the mouthfeel to be firmer.  Damn tasty and drinkable; this is not as outstanding as I thought it would be. I like Blue Paddle and Scrimshaw just as much. Still, I want another bottle or two... or a keg.

Taste consists of a strong wheaty flavor with a grainy aftertaste. Other than that one ingredient I'm not even picking up any of the popular orange or lemon sweetness. Kind of bland.  Mouthful is pretty light, awesome carbonation, and very refreshing.  Drinkability is great. Pils have never been the most exciting beers for me, or wheat type beers in general.

The beer pours nicely with a significant head that doesn't last too long. The color is pleasing, sort of a medium light straw. Enough color to suggest something interesting. From the first smell and taste I can tell I like it. I haven't had a Pilsner Urquell in some time, but this tastes very, very similar to me. Medium high-notes, very drinkable, a good beer.

Hop aroma a bit subdued, and also a bit of malt aroma evident as well.  A hint of malt sweetness initially, but then nothing but hops. Dries out toward the finish with a good lingering hop bitterness very in the spirit of the style. An earthy character to the hopiness.  Medium body and moderately high carbonation. Maybe a bit more body (less dry) than expect from this style.  Overall an intensely hoppy beer, but with enough malt to support it. Very fresh, clean lager character.

T: ""So fresh and so clean"" malt and hops perfectly balanced. Slight hop bitterness in the end. Good stuff.  M: Strong flavor leaves a hoppy aftertaste. Not too much carbonation.  D: Very good, full of flavor, sessionable.  This is a more complex beer than I expected. The hops and malt can both be noticed.

345,1010,bluejacket74,4.03,"12 ounce bottle says best before Feb 12, 2007. Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a light golden color with an inch and a half white puffy head. Lacing and head retention are both pretty good. It smells like lemon, grain and malt. It tastes like citrus (lemon), grain/bread, and it also has a bit of a peppery spicyness to it. There's also a slight hop bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light, but crisp and refreshing. It would be better for a hot summer day, but it's still good on a colder day. Drinkability is very good, it would be a good session beer for me in the summertime. I think this is a pretty good pilsner, I'd definitely buy it again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Taste is sparkley clean - A clean hop is present, malty, and lemony. This has a very dry taste.  Mouthfeel is crisp and creamy. The two usually seem opposite, but they both work together in this brew - somehow - and it works well.  Finish is clean and has a citrus.flavor. A dry clean aftertaste is left behind.

Nice straw gold colour with lots of foam that holds up nicely, in fact, it lasted for the whole session and it made some nice lacing on the side of my glass.  The nose has a nice citrus smell to it; more of a lemon than grapefruit.  The taste is true to the nose with lots of lemon citrus hoppiness that bursts onto your taste buds. A few more sips in and, now that my palate has gotten used to the strong flavour from the hops, I notice that there *is* an ample malt presence that was initially hidden. It's really not on the sweet side but it's there and does offset the bitterness toa degree. The finish is very dry and leaves me yearning for more. A super drinkable sample of a Pilsner....I dare say it's my all time favourite and.... I'm glad I went to check my reviews before opening this(last) bottle. I thought for sure that I had reviewed it before but no, I didn't!!!??

S: Sweet perfumy malt is very present up front. The nose was also a good amount of grainess as well.  T & M: Perfumy and a little caramel malt up front that fades to grassy hopes in the true taste. Aftertaste leaves a nice amount of hop bitterness and sweet perfumy malt taste that leaves you wanting more. Mouthfeel is very good for the style, as it's fairly medium bodied, which is just what a German Pilsner should be.  D: Highly drinkable German Pilsner assuming you like the style. Looks fairly similar in terms of color to other lagers out there (many people don't realize head retention and lacing have a lot to do with a beer), but tastes completely different as is defenitely not for a ""I'm only a Bud Light guy"".

The hops dont smell regular, more biting than expected. I must assume its correct for the German style as if anything it reminds more of its American counterparts.  Certainly not a taste that I am used to. Tastes fresh. Fresh hops, not like the biting smell I get. More like a ""camp"" beer smell ... you know the one ;).  Fresh and floral, but almost creamy. Carbonation is very surprising. Much less than expected and in a good way. Very nice overall, impressive down the line.  Very drinkable.

Smells of pils malt, gentle and elegant, some piny, but subdued hops, pale malts and a hint of honey (like mentioned in other reviews). The taste is crisp and refreshing, a very quenchable beer, I feel as though I enjoy it more the bigger the mouthful I drink. The pils malt is present, with subtle bitterness from the hops. To make an oxymoron this beer screams of subtlety. The quality of the water is even present to a degree, as far as my limited experience with pils this is very nice.

Lacing also impresses even beforre the first sip.  Tight, tasty flavor that opens with malt and finishes with a broad river of open ended, piney hops. Aftertaste is satisfying and long lasting. Mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. Extremely European tasting.. If I didn't know better I'd have sworn this was an import, which is praise, particularly in this style.

T- This beer has a smooth faint pale malt freshness with a soft raw corn note to it. The herbal green hops have a hint of ginger spice to them that finish in a nice hoppy bite.  M- The mouthfeel is light with a dry finish but I didn't detect any note of sulfur dryness.

The aroma is sweet with subtle fruity hints of pineapple and citrus rind. There is a spicy, pepper smell in the background.  Light, sweet flavor blends balances into a medium citrus hop profile. Mellow grapefruit with hints of pineapple finish with a spicy, bitter finish. Lots of pepper and clove spiciness in the aftertaste with a splash of zesty, citrus sweetness.  Light palate with a good amount of carbonation.  This is a nice Pilsener from Victory. I wasn't expecting the full range of spices but the taste does not disappoint.

Appearance in glass was straw yellow and crystal clear. Aroma in the glass was again noble hops with a touch of maltiness. Taste: Bitter up front, rich tasting but not a lot of body, with a slightly sweet finish and a pleasant bitter aftertaste. Upon warming, gets a little sour reminiscent of American lagers. Drinkability: This is a really fine beer. It look and taste are exceptional. The hop bitterness and aroma are well balanced, not excessively malty or sour like American style and some European lagers. It's a hard style to perfect, and they've nearly done so. American macro breweries are technically capable of making a pilsner this good, why o why do they elect not to?

345,1010,becktone,3.43,"This German Pils pours a golden straw yellow into my glass, the head is as white as white can get and stabilizes at about one finger. Lacing appears to be good as well.  The aroma of this beer is very clean. Noticable spicy hop aromas make up a large portion of this beer's aroma proflie. There is also a small amount of citrus aroma in the hop aroma profile of this beer. The sweet malt aroma is right in the front of the smell, but is secondary to the hop aromas.  The first and foremost character that I notice from this beer is its coarse bitterness. Floral hop character dominates the hop profile of this beer, and there is also a bit of spiciness. Bitterness lingers after it has been swallowed then slowly melts away. Hop character and bitterness trump malt characteristics in this brew. Malt sweetness and character is there but is in the background of the hop focus of this beer.  The brew is lightbodied and has a higher level of carbonation which benefits this beer in my opinion. The beer finishes somewhat dry, and leaves you wanting more. All in all this is a pretty good beer, but I would prefer something of a different style. I'll probably not buy this beer in the near future because there are many other Pils I've yet to try. This beer didn't make a good enough impression on me for it to become my ""house pils.""",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Very big acid hop presence that borders on sour. Lemon rind and unsweetened grapefruit are unaccompanied by any sort of balancing malt. Very acrid and astringent. This brew is like a sharp biting blade of tart hops.  Mouthfeel is appropriately light and quenching. Good carbonation level....not to bubbly like some pilsners.

A nice noble hop spiciness comes through at the end.  Taste is good. Like a pilsner but the flavors seem to be more pronounced than most which is a plus. There's hay/grassy flavor throughout that balances with the graininess in the back. The hop spiciness comes through at the swallow.

It's certainly an attractive looking beer. The mild floral nose is rather non-descript and belies a very well balanced flavor. Crisp, clean hop flavor is most immediate on the pallate, followed by bitter malt in equal measure. No one flavor outshines the other. It's just smooth.

Taste definitely grew on me - at first, hoppy bitterness overwhelms you, but a flowery-fruit aftertaste came through after a few sips. The herbal hints balance out the hops very nicely and you have yourself a very nice brew. It is a very unique selection from Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,HossMcGraw,4.02,"Pours a pale yellow with a respectable white head and a little lacing. The aroma is comprised of fresh biscuit notes with a decent amount of European funkiness that is common with this style. A little spiciness and a hint of mint is there too.  The taste is pretty much your standard European Pilsner. Initially sweet with a dry bitter breadiness in the finish. Nice but unremarkable. Mouthfeel is kind of flat, but the drinkability is terrific. Very easy to drink. Exactly the type of beer I like to session.  Would've liked to see some more hopiness and I don't see why people think it's hoppier than other pilsners. That being said, I didn't brew it so I really can't complain. A very nice representation of a traditional German pilsner. This tastes almost exactly like Pilsner Urquell.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,JayQue,3.6,"This beer has a dull yellow color, a small head (white), and minimal lacing. Slight hops aroma, very average taste - like a slightly more crisp macro lager. Mouthfeel average, drinkability average/good Would not seek this one out. This is a very ordinary beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,HoustonTX,4.58,"Pours a deep yellow, with small orange highlights. Carbonation is world-class, and this is beyond beautiful in the Duvel tulip. Millions of steams of orchestrated strands glisten upwards, in definitive pace. With a large white head, that lasts and lasts.  Smell is light with plentiful layers of fruit. Cut fresh hay with a citrus zest, very light effervescent grape, and tangy melon.  Taste upfront has a blast of spicy wheat, and light hay. Delicious German malts. Grassy hops, with a tangy citrus twang take over soon after. Soon the citrus takes over leading way to another spicy semi-floral hop wave. This Pilsner is overall, a blast of flavors screaming for attention. Your palate better damn well listen! The Saaz hops work well with this Pilsner, creating such a beautiful blend of flavor.  I have to say, I love this brew. It's just incredibly solid, any way you look at it. Victory nailed the German Pilsner style here. Prosit!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Pooba001,4.65,"Appearance is light, clear, well carbonated, and has good head that could stick around a little longer. Smells good, with distinguishable grain, and Czech and German hops. Flavor is an excellent balance, hops are more prominent than a normal pils, which I appriciate. Light malt and grain are still noticible. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, close to perfect. I'm not a huge fan of the pilsner style, but this is one of the few I can drink a many of and I actually WANT to!!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,TexIndy,3.35,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date into a pilsner glass. Was a nice straw color with good head and carb. Had the typical pilsner smell and looked great but the taste was average for me. Finished a little too dry for my liking and was a little too hoppy. I'm new to the style so will try again as palate develops. (3,RB,ML,O)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,nicefix,4.04,"Pours very clear golden with a nice head, decent retension and some lace.  Smells of hay, hops, floral.  To me, the taste was unusual at first, not what I expected. It packs some flavor. Nice herbal hop fix with some malt to back it up.  Deffinitely quite drinkable. I enjoyed this beer. Recommended",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,maundythirsty,3.95,"Very clear and light straw color. Thin white head without any retention to speak of beyond a thin skin of tiny bubbles. Smells herbal and grassy with a whiff of alcohol. But maybe that was my breath.  Taste is a quick punch of mellow malt, spicy hops, bitterness and you're home. Suitably light. Not much carbonation in my bottle.  Bullseye. In a more pleasant alternate universe this is what we get when we open a can of macrobrew. Come back, summer. I want to drink more Prima Pils.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ericj551,4.28,"Prima Pils pours a nice clear gloden color, not too deeper than most macros that claim to be of the same style. Smell is hoppy with hints of a yeasty aroma. Taste is nice and light, but in a good way. There is a nice hop edge and sweet malty background that shows that despite the beers light color, it can still be quite flavorful. Nice hop flavor and aroma as well.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,psinderson,4.21,"Served on-tap in a pint glass.  Appearance: A beautiful straw golden; Good sized white head with tiny bubbles.  Smell: Some noble hop aroma, very clean.

345,1010,rowew,4.52,"Victory in Colorado! This has finally made it to the Colorado shelves.  Presentation: 12 oz longneck. Description of the beer, but no freshness info to be found.  Appearance: Light gold color with a nice frothy head. Fades to a thick lacing on the top and the sides.  Smell: Bready malt, a whiff of sulphur, and some noble hops.  Taste: Lots of noble hop flavor, with a good malt backbone. The hint of suplhur shows up here. Nicely balanced, leaning towards the hops.  Overall impression: Great pilsner - I am always excited to see a new craft pilsners on the shelf. Hopefully this one moves fast enough in Colorado to stay fresh.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Imstillthegman,4.27,"Prima Pils pours a clear light straw / golden color (kinda remind me of a piss color) with a thick white head. Little lace left, though, for a thick head.  Floral hops are strong in this one. Sourdough bread in the mix as well with just a hint of sweetness. Hoppy aroma for a pilsner, but I like it.  Taste runs along the same lines as the smell. Slightly bitter floral hops upfront with the sour, bready flavor in the middle. More hop bite at the finish. Very crisp. The sweet and sour mixes very well in the middle. Hoppier than others in this style that I have had. For a hop head that is a good thing though.  Crisp, clean, bubbly feel in the mouth. Leans more to the thin side. Very refreshing warm weather beer. Very easy to drink. I think I know what I will be getting more of for my Labor Day cookout. Another tasty brew from Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,mjc410,5,"This beer has gone up in my estimation, so I've decided to review it again. It's simply the finest example of a Pils that I've come across. The edelhopfen aroma, taste, and prolonged bitterness are so heavenly. The incredible carbonation and refreshing character make it my warm weather beer of choice. I've had cases of this, and it's probably my favorite (easy) beer!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,cproioi,3.85,Another beer from Baba Budan's in Cincinnati Ohio.  The beer pours a light yellow body with a white head that lastes for a decent amount of time but turns to a film across the top of the beer. The smell and taste are very hoppy giving it a floral taste and aroma. It's a light-medium bodied beer that finishes refreshingly dry and makes me wanting another one. This beer is one of my favorite pilsners out there. I mean it's the perfect hop head's lawn mowing beer. It's light in body dry and refreshing and hoppy as no other pils I have met as of this date.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Cresant,3.32,"Poured this 12 oz. into a pilsner glass. No date. Chill haze evident, Yellowy straw color. Minimal head, this may be an old bottle?  Smell was of sour/tart wet grains.  Taste was crisp and tangy with a sweet finish.  Mouthfeel was a raspy Saaz hop texture.  I did enjoy this one, I am a Pilsner fan. I do feel this one was past it's ""prima"". I look forward to giving this one another try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

This one pourded a golden strawlike color with a nice bright white head and decent lacing. It has a nice strong hop aroma with some grassy undertones. The taste transported me back to Germany instantly. A nice strong bitter hop bite with an ever so slight malt sweetness and a tinge of grassiness. The finish was unbelievably crisp and biting. A perfect German style pilsner that I will definitely keep stocked until I return to Deutschland.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,Louie1031,4.18,"Drinking this one a short time after the enjoy by date: 15Jul06. Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pour resulted in a nice white head that left a good amount of lace as I quaffed this one down. Prima Pils has a light golden hue with substantial carbonation.  This brew gives off a citrus-like hop scent with a bit of spicyness. Pilsner malt smell evident as well.  The taste is certainly bold for a Pilsener. Hop spicyness lingers after the swallow. Nice crisp finish. Malt definitely rides sidekick to the hops in this Pilsner, which I like a lot. Victory definitely stepped it up a notch with this one.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth, with noticeable carbonation pricking the tongue throughout.  One could definitely rip back a few of these after a tough day at work and be better for it. Especially if you like a side of hops with your pilsner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,benito,3.61,"From the bottle, this was a hazy straw with a disappointingly thin head and lots of carbonation. Fortunately, the bouquet and flavors were top-notch: lots of floral aromas in the nose and a buttery sweetness followed by a crisp, dry, and very bitter hop finish.  The bitter finish is almost too overwhelming, though I think it really only detracts from this brew in terms of drinkability. I don't know that I think this deserves the title of BA's best German pilsener, but it is quite tasty. A worthwhile summer brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Characteristic skunkiness that is common with pilsner beers. M: Moderate to heavy carbonation bite on the tongue D: Good Pilsner, I never really drink this style of beer but would be very refreshing on a hot summer day.

345,1010,Phatz,4.45,"I have had this beer a number of times. It always goes down too darn quickly for me to get any sort of notes on it. Mighty tasty stuff. This time I held back to take these notes:  Appearance: Pours a lemon straw yellow color with a semi hazy body and a big white head.  Smell: Lemon grain and herbal hops. It is clean and certainly hoppy. Just what I expect from a German Pilsner. Its that spicy Saaz that just tickles my nose and the anticipation builds.  Taste: No disappointment here. This beer is packed full of flavors and depth (for a Pilsner especially). It has a solid malt backbone (with a dash of sweetness) that holds it together and of coarse spices and grassy Saaz hop bitterness that is bold but not cloying. The aftertaste is the best part of this beer. It sticks with you relentlessly and beckons for the next sip. Thus the drinkability! WOW!  Mouthfeel: Incredibly smooth and crisp with a very dry finish. Superb!  Drinkability: Don't mess around, this beer is like Pringles; once you pop you can't you can't stop. Make sure you have plenty cuz after one you'll want more. This beer is built for sessioning, parties and *DRINKING!*  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Winter,4.15,"Pours a clear pale golden with a foamy white head. Saaz hops jump right out in the nose, in addition to a bready malt with a feint touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and crisp. Spicey Saaz hops are noticeable right away in the taste. Flavor's a little non-descript upfront, but the assertive hoppiness of the Saaz comes through soon enough. Flavors of grapefruit are also present in the hoppy pils. Without the assertive use of hops I think this would be a rather regular and bland pilsner. Nice maltiness toward the back. Lingering hop bitterness in the finish. I had this with Italian sausages and pasta and it paired wonderfully. Definitely one to seek out and give a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,DaveFL1976,4.24,"Pours a crystal clear straw color with a bright white head. Unfortunately, my head almost completely disappeared in 3 minutes and didn't even leave a trace on the side of the glass.  The smell is nice and fresh. Even the smell is refreshing. Lots of nice flowery hops in the nose, along with some sweet malt.  Holy Munich, Batman! This is a lovely pilsner. Nice and clean, a bit sweet, with a great Saaz aftertaste lingering in your mouth.  Very thin mouthfeel could use a little thickening up, in my opinion. And maybe a higher mash temp might help with head retention, too.  The taste makes up for the thin mouthfeel and the ordinary looks. This is quite drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Unfortunately in California so far I had not been able to find fresh Victory product Pours a pale golden yellow with a nice single finger head that melts to sticky lacing which seems to last the entire glass. Aroma is lager yeasts and grass with the tiniest of sweet malt. Taste is brisk and clean...sweet malt...with a nice pleasant hop bite on the tale end that drys the mouth as it should. Aftertaste is a pleasant blend of the malt and hops...still drying...making you want another sip...then another. Exactly the way a summer beer should be. VERY drinkable.

Smells sweet and a bit hoppy. Taste is similar, but it lacks crisp flavors. The hops dont have much flavor and he malt flavor is pretty plain. It just kind of tastes like a light pale ale.

345,1010,ggaughan,4,"The beer poured a vibrant yellow color with a bright white head and some lacing on the glass. The nose was a fresh hop character with a touch of spice.

345,1010,Damian,3.5,Poured a clear golden yellow with a small head that quickly disappeared. Generous lacing left streaks down the sides of the glass.  Subtle hoppy and skunky aromas.  Taste was somewhat hoppy with hints of citrus and spices coming through as well. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Crisp and refreshing.  Very easy drinking.  Definitely more flavorful than your average pilsener but overall not much better.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Liquids,3.92,"Pours a foamy two-finger head, with a transparent, super pale yellow hue and effervescent carbonation. Smells resinous and spicy. Hops at first, but a little less hoppy than the aroma indicated. Tastes rather hoppy, but in a spicy way--good hop choice. As for the malt/yeast aspect, it's middle of the road--not stale but not quite bready, though malt flavors have improved since the last time I tried it. Clean overall. No alcohol noticable. Mouthfeel is actually too high in carbonation for me, light but not watery. With a heavy pour, the flavors are more balanced. Mind you, it's a pils. Drinkability is rather good, and this is a truly good pils, which are hard to come by. Far better than Brooklyn (at least in the bottle), but still not quite as pleasing as my local microbrew pils (New England Elm City Lager). A big, widely available winner of a pale crafted lager.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,zjungleist,4.25,"Pours lemon yellow with a short but very lasting white head. The smell is slightly sweet malts with lagery yeast and a very slight hop sting. The taste is nearly perfect for a pils in my opinion. Slightly sweet up front, with a slight cirtus flavor mixed in the with bitter hops. Mouthfeel is also excelent, somewhat dry, lacking the ""slick"" feeling I get from lots of pilsners, and with a perfect medium-high carbonation. Overall I have to say this beer meets all of my requirements for a pilsner, and is virtually free from flaws. Very refreshing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Georgiabeer,4.32,"I drank this beer while visiting Maryland in July- and staying in an unairconditioned room, and man did it hit the spot.  The beer pours a lovely pale straw color with a very white thin head that dissipates quickly.  There is a lovely scent of crispness and hops in the nose, smells as a good pilsner should.  The taste is excellent. The bitterness is definitely there, but is well balanced. There is a rich fruitiness with some slight cream nuances following the bitter. Rounder and fuller than some German style pilsners, but still delicious.  The mouthfeel is pretty dry, but the roundness and creaminess mentioned above subtract from the crispness that should be a little more prominent on the finish.  Same goes for drinkability- It is very drinkable, but a little crisper finish would have been even more welcome on this hot day. The hops are nice, but could have even a little more oomph.  Overall a very nice beer, any negative comments are really just nitpicking. I'll definitely drink this again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

I don't have a whole lot to say about this except that its summer delight packed in a bottle. Ultra crisp, refreshing, delectable, and uplifting. Aroma is wonderfully spicey hopped with a suggestion of pineapple among the lemons/limes. Nice solid sweet bready malts, and a hint of butter add fullness. Taste is just as delightful. It shares all the same qualities with added spicey bitterness. Mouth is so slick and smooth, a little resinous, grassy, and nicely dry through the finish. Perfect carbonation too. Drinkability is intense. Its as if there's a gravitational force inside of me pulling my Prima Pils in. Mmmmm.  A great German pils Victory-affied. Possibly my favorite Pils.

Taste is very nice with a great hoppy bitter finish. Nothing overblown but just enough so that you can distinguish this from every other pilsner other there. Hints of light fruit and grain from the malt but the finish is all hops. Very dry but leaves a lingering bitter aftertaste. An IPA of Pilsners.  VERY enjoyable, one of my favorite pilsners.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Body is quite heavy for the style (alcohol?). Hops aren't as forward as I anticipated. Reminds me of a pretty standard American Pils. It's clean and refreshing, though I'd like a bit more carbonation. Exp date of June 28th, 06.... I feel this is a much better brew when fresh. Bitterness doesn't come in any more so than an Urquell, but it is appropriate. Overall, a bit of a dissapointment, I anticipated something more enlightening by the previous reviews.

345,1010,sloejams,4.45,"Prima Pils is the best American example, Ive had of a classic German pilsner. In fact, Prima Pils is probably the best pilsner Ive ever had. The bottle pours a straw color into my glass. Nice carbonated streams of bubble percolate the glass reaching the ¼ inch froth head. The aroma provides the obvious hops: herbs and spices. Pale malts come through in the taste with the said hops. A lil grain flavor hides beneath. The taste is smooth and subtle; even though it far out-hops any European pilsner youll ever have.  Its a remarkably delicious and easy drinking lager. One word of wise: if picking up a 6 pack of this delicious nectar, be sure to check the Born On Date. This is not a beer that tastes as good past its prime. Ive walked that road, please dont follow.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,guitarmage,4.05,"Appearance: Nice clear, pale yellow. White head reduces to a sticky lacing.  Smell: Mild grains and grassy hops, almost marijuana like.  Taste: Really mild upfront, citrus in the middle then a pretty strong grassy hop blast finishes and cleans things up.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and light bodied, almost dissolves from the mouth.  Drinkability: Really clean and then you get hit with a dose of hops. I like it and find it really drinkable.

Taste - Citrus (grapefruit) and floral hops. Faint grain finish calms the hops. Mouthfeel - Light mouthfeel. Crisp, dry finish. Drinkability/Notes - Another really nice beer from Victory, they have such great full hops. Unique, interesting and highly enjoyable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,akorsak,4.15,"This is a bottle of Prima Pils served in a Three Philosophers goblet.  Appearance: The pils is a golden yellow color, very bright and vibrant with no hint of any impurities.  Smell: The pils has a firm biscuity malt aroma that mixes nicely with a strong earthy hop aroma.  Taste: The beer has a spicy noble hop flavor that is durable and tasty without destroying your taste buds. The malts are well balanced, giving just enough of a sweetness to really accentuate the hops.  Mouthfeel: This really is a victory for your tastebuds.  Drinkability: Well-made pils, perfectly suitable for a hot summer day or and other day of the year.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Spicy hops covering a grainy malt profile.  T - I likey. The noble hops are more abundant in this beer than most other pilsners, and helps. Initial taste is spicy, somewhat peppery with slightly bitter and dry finish.  M - Decent. As mentioned, a tad dry, but it feels nice.  D - Very good. Nice summertime beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Mdog,4.8,"Appearance: Light gold with moderate carbonation. A quick pour will give a large head.  Smell: Strong grassy hops.  Taste: Some malt sweetness, then an onslaught of grassy hops.  Mouthfeel: Light and refreshing, with a dry finish that keeps you coming back for more.  Drinkability: An excellent session beer.  This is one of my all-time favorites and a ""second step"" beer. Maybe not the first craft beer to advocate to newbies, but a good beer to steer them to next. Very highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BEERchitect,4.22,"Tried at USBTC Tasting at Jungle Jim's Cincinnati. It's a mo-ped for Ale drinkers: they enjoy it, but they don't want to admit it to their Ale drinking friends. In reality, this is about as good as a pilner gets. Though no amped up body, hops, or foreign character, it's simple and to-the-point. A nice pilner malt base with characterful hops (may not be classic noble versions) and maybe an American hop or two for a better citrus and acidic hop finish. Lightly earthy and dusty, and a body that is on the upper end of the style scale. Although many will proclaim the Pilsners should not contain esters of any sort, I find that a pleasant, light estery quality of pears and a nectar-like perfume aroma compliment the beer well. Because of esters and basically no dms or acetaldahyde, the beer may use ale yeast? Finsihes very clean and very crisp. No doubt a best-of-style beer!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Crisp herbal and grassy hops - lemon citrus zest and bready grain. Its got some bite to it and the dryness lingers.  Not just a thirst quencher, this is a damn fine beer. Very fresh...good pils!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,dfried,3.92,"Bright and crisp clear golden color with a head that settled to a slight film. The smell is sweet and zesty. The taste is quite sweet and smooth as you would expect from a lager initially, not all that different from most American domestics, but then the subtleties become more apparent and thrusts this well above average.

I was very interested in trying this after reading glowing reviews, so it looked good in the glass before the first taste.  It had a light beer taste to it with a zing of hops that was nearly overpowering in grapefruit type of flavors. Was I drinking the hyped beer that I had read too much about? I could see others liking it and a tasting draft might be its saving grace for me at another time, but it was not for me with grilled salmon on the table as I reached for the fridge for another choice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Nice extra hop taste that hits first followed by a smooth aftertaste. Very nice refreshing taste. One of the better pilsner's I've ever had. Would have this again in a second! Slick and smooth through the mouth with a nice level of carbonation that keeps you wanting more.

Taste: Slightly citrusy. Hops dominate the finish, with a clean, dry hoppy bitterness lingering on the tongue and mouth. A very nice version of a pilsner.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation level and body for this style. Remember, we're not talking a heavy beer, but this really fits the style.  Drinkability: Excellent. HIGHLY sessionable. Great lighter-style beer for hanging out on the deck in the sun, but far from flavor-less. Enjoy all summer long.  Note: this was the first of 3 German-style pilsners I sampled back-to-back-to-back this weekend. In my opinion, it was the best of the 3 (the others were Stoudt's Pils and Eku Pils).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,plaid75,4.47,"Poured a medium straw hue with a two finger foamy head. Very good retention and lacing.  The smell was wild. Off the bat marijuana aroma which slowly dissipated into a smooth flowery hop scent. A bit of a biscuity aroma detected as well.  The taste was unique for a pils. Flavors of flowery and citrusy hop balanced slightly by a great biscuity flavor. Nice and dry as well.  The mouthfeel was excellent. The healthy dose of hops and the carbonation gave this beer a nice zip.  A highly drinkable beer. Not the best example of the classic German Pils, but who cares. This beer was magnificent. In my opinion, perhaps the best session beer out there.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Better than most pilsners and definitely not what I was expecting...in a good way.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,GreenWBush,3.1,"Now here's a beer i've been waiting for with baited breath. I get quite angry about the lack of quality session beers to be had in the craft-world, especially the dearth of tasty pilsners. Perhaps my expectations here were just so high for a style so subtle I was setting myself up for a let-down.  Prima Pils pours out of the Hopleaf bar tap a shiny brass with a voluminous head. Its phenomenal head-structure creates a ferocious meringue atop the pitcher.  The aroma is that of lightly toasted grainy malt and huge Saaz-y hops...and not much else. A few plastic flavors make me think 'munich malt'.  Taste is...well, a huge let down. A nice bready - not grainy - malt flavor fills the mouth, then the lime-like citrus hop charge starts. The bitterness is not particularly high, but I just can't get around this odd and off-putting raggedness. Doesn't sit well on the tongue. One pint is plenty. Near-puckering almost sour flavor drags down the score, despite the bartender's claim of a fresh keg.  I appreciate the effort of crafting a flavorful pilsner...just not the actual resulting beer. Perhaps this draft-offering was just an off-batch. I'll look forward to trying this again, however, as legions of Victory fans can't be wrong.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Vancer,3.87,"Well Ill be  once ya get a good pilsner, it does make a difference! Very sturdy brew here, started off by a lemon yellow pour, with a smallish white head (lil disappointing). BBD of 5/20/06  Sharp hop notes in the aroma, followed by a rich and malty quaff. Sharp and crisp, almost like a Czech pilsner, but without any euro skunk to distract you from the rich flavor.  These Primas would make for a nice evening of session quaffing.  Thanks to beerbeing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

The taste is light and dry, with a more prominent hop taste than most Pilsners, and I feel like a touch of American hops, although the bottle says no. Overall quite a good pilsner; a little more bitter than I'd like, but it's a clean bitterness that doesn't really compromise the drinkability. If anything, it could stand to be a bit dirtier in the Czech style. But I suppose that's not what they were going for.

What a good choice.  Came home the next day and only picked up a six pack, just in case my tastebuds deceived me and it was just a fluke. Opened the bottle and,,,Nice.  Look at Prima in a glass and you'd say it might be an offering from BMC. One taste, however, and you'll know there's a bit of pride put into the brewing of this fine grog. The pure white head laces till the very end. The carbonation is nice and suttle. The taste is a light citrus/hop combination. It immediately makes you want to have another sip. I'm picking up a citrus smell, lemon? An absolutely great choice for the summer season. I could pair this with just about anything off of the grill. I am by nature a lover of strong Belgian browns. There comes a time though, when I crave something ligher. This is the perfect beer to relax with while lounging around on a warm summer's day.

Mouthfeel is fizzy and light, with a generally clean finish.  Ok, I'm not a huge fan of the pilsener style. I like funkier punch you in the face ales, but this is very good and very drinkable.

The first aroma I noted was an oregano hinting at the edges of the hops. The aroma was very pleasent, and I wanted to use it as an air freshener in my car.  The first sip had an almost nutty flavor, with an aftertaste of lemon. Hops were also very evident in the flavor of this beer. I was surprised at how well the blend of flavors danced on my tongue.

Pours a pale, clear straw yellow with 2-3 fingers of snowy, fluffy head. Nose is light with notes of musty malt husk, grass and unfortunately a waft of piss as it warms. Taste is light and bright - leafy hop bitterness, grassy/musty malt - very ""clean"" and sterile tasting. Mouthfeel is lager smooth and nicely crisp.

It has a minimal white head that clears quickly. The aroma is of fresh baked bread and floral noble German hops.  The flavor of the beer begins with a spicy and pronounced flow of hops. The hops are bold, but in no way harsh. As the beer goes down, the crispness of the pale pilsener malt flavor shines through. It is marked by notes of bread yeast and some biscuity flavors - truly ""liquid bread."" There are also very small amounts of phenols that hit the tip of your togue, which adds a little spiciness to the overall picture.  The carbonation is spot on and lively.

345,1010,JerzDevl2000,4.01,"Picked this up recently to go along with the warmer weather. I love Victory's Hop Devil and Storm King Stout, so I had a lot of anticipation for this offering of theirs as well. It was very enjoyable, and solidly crafted. The Pilsener is not my favorite style of beer, but I can see why this wins raves and is popular during the warmer months!  This beer had a great pour - nearly filled my pint glass up, wonderful streams of bubbles in nice, vertical towers, and a gorgeous goldenrod hue were all very pleasing to the senses. The taste was hard for me to pinpoint, since I love beers with loads of flavor and nuances to them. This isn't like that, but it still grew on me very nicely. A bit of a herbal tone to it, with notes of straw and grass, and a very soapy and slightly metallic undertone to bottom it out. A clean, crisp finish and the right amount of carbonation can be found here too, and I love how it tingles on the upper half of my mouth long after I've taken my last sip of it. The maltiness is present, but not too heavy, and this is a very filling beer relative to the lighter spring and summer offerings!  I couldn't taste any of the alcohol in this, and it went down so easily, but never as anything to be chugged or consumed at a fast pace. Certainly worth a try for the warm-weather beer drinker who wants a subtly and solidly satisfying experience.

I was looking for something a little lighter for this spring and summer and I believe this to be my guy. Beautiful golden color, white thick head which draws in to about a finger...nice lacing. Hops on the nose with a little sweet, fruitiness. Hoppy, fleeting malt for balance, and a little banana can be picked up. Carbonation is perfect for a refreshing finish.

This is the epitome of ""clean"" fermentation characteristics. No esters, diacetyl, fusels at all.  Mouthfeel: High carbonation, light body. Finishes very dry with the hop flavor lingering.

I've enjoyed the opportunity to get my hands on some of the most coveted beers made in America today.  The Prima Pils has been a very unusual ride for me. I typically enjoy Euro-styled pilsners and pretty much know what to expect from them, but the Prima Pils kind of threw me for a loop. I've actually held off on reviewing it for a while. I wanted to try it several times over a period of weeks in order to get a better handle on it.  The pour is just fantastic. The beers looks great in the mug, spewing forth a massive head of foam atop a cloudy straw body. The nose was strong and floral, with a hint of citrus and a stronger sense of hops.  The taste is where this beer really confounded me. The hop presence in the flavor just kind of overwhelms everything else. It's almost enough to make me think I'm drinking an IPA. There is a bready sort of malt character, but it's muted into the background. Slight traces of lemon verbena, maybe? Perhaps, but if so, it's almost obliterated by the strong and overpowering hops.  The mouthfeel was a bit harsh. Well-carbonated. Ultimately, I'm not going to be reaching for this one very often.  It's pretty obvious what Victory was going with here. The hop flower prominently displayed on the label should have clued me in that this was no ordinary Euro-pilsner. It's definitely an interesting and somewhat confounding beer, and I'm glad I picked up the sixer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

A grassy herbal biscuit followed with hint of lemon and more herbs. Slightly dry herbally aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - somewhat full, a little chewy, much carbonation ( in that good-on-a-hot-day-thirst-quenching sort of way ) Smooth, with a moderate amount of hop oil slickness.

The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with lively carbonation. Although this is still a light beer, it is probably the heaviest pilsener I have yet tasted, and I do think that the extra weight really helps the mouthfeel.

Taste was very clean, there was a grainy body that had an almost floral, going into a grassy hop taste with a very spicy mouth after you finish the beer that stuck on my tongue for a good minute after the first drink. Incredibly crisp, easy to drink, beautiful beer. I hate the fact I cannot get this beer at home.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ChuckD,4.2,"12oz bottle poured into a pilsener glass. Thick, dense white lacing atop a clear golden body.  To the nose, the hop character is overwhelming. Not abrasive or nasty - but a pleasant floral spiciness.  In the mouth, the hops are verified in a super dry, spicy body with subtle malt sweetness in the back. Hops abound here and are quite tasty.  The feel is as it should be for the style. Just enough bite and carb to enhnance the floral bouquet - not overcome. It finishes dry and full.  Musings: Obviously loaded with a shitload more hops than most pils. It does work though - and the result is a nicely balanced, hop bang in a highly drinkable brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,pvsob,4.3,"Prima Pils pours to a pale yellow color with a nice head that fades slowly. It is very clear with some lacing. Hops and yeast dominate the aroma with hints of citrus breaking through. You can definitely taste the hops, but they don't slap you in the face and there is a nice balance of sweetness that accompanies the long hop finish. The body is light to moderate. Overall this is an excellent Pils, one of the best I've had to date. Extremely CRISP and very satisfying. Pick some up if you haven't tried it yet.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,OStrungT,4.13,"This beer pours a golden clear yellow. It has a thick fluffy white head that fades slowly, leaving a lot of laces. Tiny bubbles continue to rise after a few minutes.  This beer has a yeasty aroma. It is slightly spicy. I can detect a hoppy aroma with Saaz hops, I think. It smells slightly citrusy.  This beer has a spicy flavor. Not overly strong like in Belgians, just subtle. It is slightly lemony. It has a good hoppy flavor. It tastes just a little grainey.  This beer is very crisp. It goes down smooth, leaving a slightly spicy aftertaste. It is highly carbonated.  This beer might make a good session beer. It is not high in alcohol, and it is not too strong in flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,MrSeth,3.88,"Looks like a really good pilsner and doesn't disapoint! A white head forms over a crystal clear light golden body with lots of bubbly. The head settles right away and leaves swirls and some lace, standard for a pilsner in a good way.  Smells a tad skunky and hoppy. Not bad though.  The taste honeyish without being particularly sweet, malty and balanced with a perfect touch of bitterness.  Strongly carbonated, crisp and clean!  I could drink quite a few of these on a sunny day.. hope they are still available come cookout season!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Big-time Saaz hop flavor mixed with a light malt. The bitterness is really subtle, though. To be brutally honest here..if we're talking about hoppy ""summer beers"", Gumballhead still makes this brew it's bitch. That being said, I'll still try and track down some sixers of this before the brutal Iowa heat gets here.

345,1010,shbobdb,4.4,"It's like New Glarus Edel Pils (RIP) and Sam Adams Harvest Imperial Pilsner had a baby. This beer has the same fruity overtones from the yeast that Edel Pils does with a heavy heavy overlay of German Hops. Mostly Hersbrucker, is my gut feeling. I could be wrong though.  Nice and refreshing. A touch bitter and a touch too hoppy for a 'refreshing' afterwork Pilsner, but an AMAZING beer when taken on its own field. Man, nice and clean mixed with enough earthy hops to give you a touch of cottonmouth. I love it,",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,kelticblood,4.12,A big step up from the mass produced crap pilsners out there. Some time was actually spent into crafting this. Poured out a hazy straw yellow almost like a wheat beer. Light and foamy head didnt last that long. Aroma of pine and hops. Slight skunky aroma in the beginning. Leaves a medium bitterness. Very good carbonation with a crisp finish. Light and refreshing. A very drinkable Pilsner. Just wish they werent $9 a six pack.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

A lot more flavor than I was expecting, nice initial bite with the carbonation tickling your tongue.  M. thin, slightly above watery, however as I prefer stouts and porters, this could be from my bias.  D. For a person stepping over from the average macro pilsner this beer will slow down their drinking. I found it VERY drinkable and loved the nice hoppy characteristics.

345,1010,sinistrsam,4.34,"I have to admit, I have yet to find a better microbrew Pilsner. I got a craving for a Pilsner a while back and went on BA to check out some reviews, and this was at the top, so I found a place in Durham with it on tap, and I was not disappointed. It was a very very pale brew, with an almost watery body, mild carbonation, somewhat hazy. The aroma was somewhat wheaty, lemony, with a little floral hoppiness, but the taste was outstanding: Bitter-sweet with piney tones, alcohol well balanced and very very dry, clean mouthfeel. I would expect this to be a great warm-weather beer, but I could drink this any time of the year. Simply a great interpretation of this style.

Taste is light with no malt detectable but there is a mild bitterness that permeates the beer and lingers into the aftertaste. Pine and lemon, but not in an overpowering IPA way.  Crisp, easy beer to drink. Nothing too complex, but it is a pilsner. And a fine one at that.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Skidz,4.62,"Pours out bright pale straw and sits a beaming pale gold in the glass with a large creamy white head. Fades to wisping of foam around the edges with good lacings all around.  Smells of bright grassy hops and light crackery malts. Simple and pleasing.  Tastes of dry, crisp pils malt with a torrent of hops bitterness closing in. Straight up grassy all the way. Finishes moderately bitter, all in perfect check.  Crisp, clean and paired with a moderate and fine carbonation with a light body.  Pils as it should be. Completely thoughtless, yet packed with indescribable nuances. This stuff cleans itself up.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,NolanGTI,4.35,"Can something be balanced and still blow away the hop profile that is traditional for its style? Well if anything can, this beer can. Simply one of the best beers to come out of Victory and one of the best US Pilsners on the market.  Color to style, with a nice nose but not overwhelming. Then the taste.. clean and crisp with the nicest little hop punch to it. One of my alltime favorites.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,DarkerTheBetter,3.68,"This beer came a bright and vibrant yellow gold with a thin film of large bubbles for a head.  Smelled like bread dough and powdery white flour with an ambiguous sour fruit.  Tastes like sweet bread dough with a musky dirty yeast and a crisp oaky hop nip that left the finish a bit dry.  The mouth feel was light to medium bodied with an intrusive small bubbled carbonation.  Over all, the finish was a bit dry, and the carbonation was prohibitive.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Pegasus,4,"Appearance: Slightly hazy medium golden in color, with a large, persistent white head, excellent broken lace, and a few small, slow-rising bubbles.  Aroma: Tangy citrus hops, with hints of pine as well, solid slightly tart pale malt beneath, and a pleasant cut grass aroma.  Taste: Opens with crisp, tart pale malt, and a wave of citrus (predominantly orange), and lesser pine hops. The malt asserts itself with a mildly sweet wave late in the taste. The finish is quite dry. A fairly sharp metallic bitterness lingers at the back of the mouth.  Mouth feel: Smooth, soft, and full, quite pleasant.  Drinkability/notes: A very well-crafted example of a style that has always struck me as being rather bland. This is far and away better than most German Pilseners.  Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a Pilsener glass.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Jredner,3.5,Aroma is slightly sulpher tinged and sharp with hops. Lemonade yellow with a huge three finger thick head that is frothy and bubbly. Fore is grainy/malty with a lot of sweetness from that malt. Hop profile is lower than I thought it would be. Definitely a great warm weather beer here as it is quite quenching.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,apintofknowledge,3.57,"Pours a pale golden with a thin white head... there's a slight haze to this one, and bubbles of carbonation rise like champagne in my glass. The aroma is of a fresh pine forest. As for the taste, there's hardly any sweetness here, with only mild notes from the grain. The effervescent bubbles build on my tongue, followed by grassy, piney, floral hop flavors. The tangy, bitter tannins linger in the finish. Make sure you get your nose into the glass as the hop aroma truly enhances the hop flavor.  Overall, a nice strong presence of hops in a beer that's lighter, crisper and more approachable than a big IPA for a malt-lover like myself. These aren't the citrus/grapefruit hop flavors so loved by many American brewers. These are the hops of a classic European pilsner punched up a few notches. Though not exactly smooth in my book, it's relatively drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

T- spicey, oily, grassy hop flavor. the finish has a little metalic soapy flavor but its not overpowering and doesnt really have any negative effect on the taste.  M- medium body with bold carbonation.  D- extremely easy to drink and refreshing.  overall- this is a great beer for almost any occasion. one of the most easy to drink and refreshing beers ive come across.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,phisig137,3.12,"This beer pours a very light straw color, with no head to speak of. A very faint aroma of citrus hops is present, but not much else. Flavorwise, I find this to be very one dimensional, with a good amount of graininess, and a smooth hop finish. One thing that is very pleasant about this beer is it's very creamy mouthfeel.  All in all, this is better than most every other american pilsner you'll find on the market. There are better from overseas, but this one is quite nice IMO.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

All hops in the smell and taste. There's a hint of pale malt that's a little bready like an amber ale. Great taste with a wonderful dry finish. This is probably my favorite pilsner at the moment.  Another great beer from Victory. Go pick this one up.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,orfeu,4.12,"Clear pale golden straw with a short-lived, pristine white head. Pungent noble hop aromas, grassy and sulfuric -- spot on for the style. Grassy hop flavor that's definitely a cut above most pilsners. Smooth malt presence, but this one is all about European lupulin. Crisp, clean mouthfeel; quenching and quite drinkable.

Nose is slightly sulfurous, nice and malty, florally hopped.  Flavor is very characteristic of German Pilseners. Really reminds me of how Bitburger tastes in Germany, (not as good in the US, though). Crisp malt up front. Later on the palate, lemon flavor is noticeable, floral hops are all over the finish. It's very tangy and tasty, should be good on a hot day, too.  Mouthfeel is medium with high carbonation and a zip on the finish.  Drinkability is great! This stuff goes down like magic.

Smell: Lemon, orange, grass  Taste: Hop explosion...this is by far the hoppiest pilsner I have ever had. There are big grapefruit and pine tastes throughout the beer. The malts provide just enough backbone to balance out the hoppiness. A little bit of sweetness sneeks through from time to time.  Mouthfeel: This is a good drink of beer. Although the hops are big, it is not overwhelmingly bitter. The beer leaves your palette refreshed.  Drinkability: This is a wonderful session pilsner.

Great well balanced taste, lots of malts up front. Finishes dry with some hoppy bitterness. Full bodied mouthfeel, but not fizzy.

It poured a pale yellow, completely transparent. The bubbly white head disappeared to a coating, and then to nothing, minimal to no lacing. A slightly yeasty smell with a few hints of clove and lemon peel. No dominate taste, certainly no lingerings. Not at all what I expected. Hops are hidden, malts aren't prominant, there is certainly something missing. Any detectable hops do show the common characteristics of a pilsner, a bit zesty, cloved, and a citrus twangs come through, but nothing is at all continually noticable or overwhelmingly appealing. I give points for its simplicity and drinkability however.  This, and I'm relatively new to the category, wasn't what I was expecting, and was overall a disappointment. Not nearly Victory's greatest.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,SurgeonGeneral,4.26,"Serving temp: 40F Serving glass: Pilsener Glass  Aroma: Zing! Noble hops abound with big citrusy lemon zest & tang zapping my nostrils. Pretty much all hops with this one, just a bit of bready maltiness coming through.  Appearance: Truly a sexy looking beer. Crystal clear, deep straw with beautiful, bountiful beading. Pure white head retains throughout, excellent, intricate lacing.  Taste: I'm not generally a Pils drinker, but this is really tasty. Clean & refreshing, only small amounts of sweetness up front, the hops are obviously the focus here- perhaps just a bit to much. Although, I'm certainly in no position to comment on what a Pils ""should"" taste like. A little bit of spice to along with a very dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Light, crisp, sparklingly refreshing. Medium carbonation gives it a little more punch and zest. It doesn't get cleaner than this, IMO.  Drinkability: A great, if somewhat overhopped Pils.

Nose is strong lupulin and sulpher. It is off-putting at first, but continued quaffing titilates.  Taste starts off bitter, but not as much as the nose led me to expect. It gives a nice zestyness that complements the higher carbonation level. Sweet malt comes to the surface almost immediately but is pushed back by the bitter hops, which have a slight lemon character, but are really mostly just bitter. Toward the finish a bit of that sulpher comes out, but does not linger unplesantly in the mouth.

Awesome stringing of tiny bubbles. The smell is not the most impressive to me, sweet yet simple hops. Clean. This has some nice yet very light and sharp hop flavor. Tastier than most pilsners i have had by far, but it certainly tastes very euro. This is drinkable. but i would take Brooklyn's Pilsener over this any day. It tastes similar to ass macro pilseners, its just that you can tell more time and better ingredients into it because there are no disgusting chemical aftertastes.

Taste is an expected metallic, spicy fresh hop with a pleasant bitter, oily finish. Malt mediates the mouthfeel. Spicy and tingly up front, cleansing and multiplyingly foamy later on, not for sweethearts, just clean, dry refreshement.

Lacing is respectable; it clings to glass unevenly and with modest vigor.  Smell: Sweet, bready malts with hints of piney hops. The beer exudes rich biscuit overtones supplemented with some mildly pungent hops.  Taste: A solid backbone of biscuit, flour, and cereals confronts one immediately. The malts proudly announce themselves in every sip of this beer. Some piney hops manage to interject themselves humbly in the midst of some serious malt assertiveness.The beer strikes me as a bit out of balance, as the hops could stand to be more pronounced.  Mouthfeel: Quite smooth and just bitter enough. The carbonation is just right. Luxurious on the tongue.  Drinkability: Exceedingly drinkable.

I didn't really detect any malts or much else to the flavor but it finished with a very distinct bite that lingers.  I think as a pilsener, this ones definately stands it's ground and pilsener fans would delite.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Aroma light malt backbone with a nice grassy hop aroma with hints of spicey hops thrown in to boot.  Taste is bready malt some mineral flavors in the background followed by nice grassy hops hints of lemon and spice. Taste is nice and hoppy for a pilsner one of the better ones I have had but I am no expert on pilsners. If better one taste like this I might try some next summer.  Mouthfeel is light but heavier then swill good carbonation, easy drinking nice.  Drinkability is good nice light but lots of flavor.

Excellent aroma of pilsner malt and hops. Smells amazingly fresh and crisp. Smells perfect.  Taste is outstanding. A super crisp maltiness upfront with a perfect amount of spicy hops followed by a super clean and dry finish. It might be hoppier than most in the style, but who cares? This is a superb tasting pilsner.  Body is good for the style.  I can drink this everyday and twice on Sunday. Such a delicious beer with an ABV that allows you to consume several without a worry. Pilsner lovers NEED to try this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,nlmartin,3.97,Poured from the bottle into a pub glass.  Appearance: Poured a pale cloudy yellow. The head was an off white honey coloration that went away.  Smell: This beer has a very upfront spicy hoppy smell with a few hints of doughyness.  Taste: For a little pilsner this one packs a whole lotta spicy hoppy goodness. There is a mild undertone of lemony sweetness paired with biscuits.  Mouthfeel: This is a very light bodied beer. The carbonation plays nicely with the hoppy lightness of the beer.  Drinkability: Pilsners are not my normal brew of choice. I dam BMC and the like for my Pilsner distaste. I am looking forward to this Pilsner and a few others when summer comes.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Enola,2.8,"This is a very thin, light bodied beer. It poured out with a decent head. The color is a cloudy light straw shade. The smell is not much different than a macro. The taste is extremely watered down. You can detect a very slight hop taste. The mouthfeel is on the edge of revolting. The drinkability could not be very high. A brewer such as Victory just plain out missed the mark with this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ToggleEyes,4.43,"Prima Pils has now become my favorite pilsner for sure. Poured out crisp clear gold, with a big head. The smell of floral hops and maybe some grapefruit. Had just the right carbonation and didn't go flat right away. The taste was ""bitter sweet"" some honey and citrice. Very good served very cold. mouthfeel was nice, sharp and crisp. A great refreshing drink.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,riversider76,2.3,"Pours a golden yellow. Head disappears quickly. Lots of carbination, not much lacing. Smell was very hoppy,and floral. Mouthfeel is light.

345,1010,Sycodrummer,3.38,"Poured from the 12oz. brown bottle into a pilsner glass the beer was a straw, full golden yellow color. Streams of carbonation ran up the sides of the glass and two fingers of pure white head formed atop the beer.  The smell is a mild hoppiness with floral undertones and a spiciness in the background. Slightly grainy as well.  Taste has an innitial hop character that creates a mild but not over powering bitterness. Some floral esters come through as well and a slightly grainy after taste. A slight malt profile, but the hops win the battle in the end yet still are not too strong.  A light body with high carbonations and a crisp finish.  A good pilsner although I find it a little bland. A little more showing from the hops would have convinced me more. A good selection to pair with lighter dishes, seafood, or pasta. For a domestic example, I prefer Brooklyn Pils over this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Shovelbum,4.32,"Golden-neon yellow body with a stark frothy white head. Decent head retention with very little lace. Light aromas of diacetyl and floral hops. Has a more generous citric and spicy hop flavor than most pilsners with an accompanying light bitterness. Theres a bit of malt in there to help balance things out, but the hops prevail. A fuller mouthfeel than most pilsners, but still quite lean. Smooth and clean from start to finish with a slight kiss of bitterness from the hops.  A well-built pilsner. The amped up hops is a nice addition and isnt so overwhelming as to throw it off kilter or too far out of style. Refreshing and drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,numenor1,4.43,"Pours crystal clear golden yellow with a substantial white, fluffy head. It sticks well and leaves lacing all over the place. The smell is slightly bready with substantial spice and lemon notes. Upfront the taste is full and bready, then gives way to an unbelievable crispness of spicy hops, less lemon, and a substantial herbal, tealike quality. It dries out terrifically through the finish with only a slight lingering bitterness and the enormous urge to sip again. Mouthfeel is quite full for a pils, and carbonated perfectly in my mind, that meaning a bit less than some other examples of the style. Session beer number 1.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,dauss,4.35,"Presentation: standard 12oz. bottle. Enjoy by date of Jan 29 06.  Appearance: Brilliantly clear golden straw yellow. A small white head forms with great retention. Very effervescent, tons of bubbles just streaming from the bottom of my tulip glass.  Smell: Clean malty aroma with a sweet wisp of alcohol. Grassy noble hops linger softly in the background with a refreshing floral quality.  Taste: Highly carbonated, hop flavor bursts right through the medium bodied malt flavor. Intense grassy noble hop flavor with a strong and smooth bitterness that lingers. Finishes dry with a light bitterness.  Notes: Crisp, refreshing, smooth, balanced. This pils is stronger on the hops that other pils I've had, and it is great. It has a nice balance with good hop flavor and moderately strong bitterness. Whoa, this beer is going to be hard to keep in the fridge because it is just so tasty.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,stewart124,4.42,Prima! Like the bottle says. Spicy/Zesty smells from the pale golden brew with a foamy white head. Earthy notes. Very tasty biscuit malts and a lean malt character. More Saaz hops are present again and really add a complexity to this pilsner. Firm aftertaste that finishes a bit dry. I had to try this beer again to make sure I was reading it right. Plus it is very drinkable and really makes me respect pilsners again. Thank you Victory for changing my mind on the way Americans do Pilsners.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Golden and parkling.  Aroma was great with subtle hops over sweetness. Mouthfeel was good, just a little chewy; a definite plus.  The taste was a thorough cleansing of the post-turkey palate that was both enjoyable and easy going down.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Aroma: The nose is of piney,woody,hops,and old malty scents.This beer is also a bit skunky to me.  Taste: The palate is of,much like the nose,pine,woods,slight hops,the old malts in the finish and even a slight buttered corn flavoring on the tongue.I would even adventure to say a little soy in the finish.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is simple,thin,slightly watery,and bubbly in the finish.

The nose is malty, with some hop notes, slight pine, grapefruit. The taste is malty, nice hop note, pines, very nice touch of grapefruit. Medium body, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Overall a very tasty brew, and glad to see it available to me.  Pours a clear yellow/golden color, nice carbonation, very small head that dissappears quickly, no lacing what so ever.. Right from the pouring I could smell hops, malts, and some citrusy. Very nice taste for a pils, little bite and dry. Medium body. Very drinkable at 5.3%, would make a nice session brew. Another very good job by Victory, would definitely recommend.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

They provide a slightly bitter taste in the middle, but not as bitter as one might expect. Plenty of carbonation.  Overall a very good beer for what Victory was apparently shooting for- a hoppy pilsner. Not bad at all",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Dry, hoppy flavour with a dry and slightly bitter finish. Light and refreshing, good to have with food as there are no over-powering flavours.

Smell: First thing that I smell is hops. Hints smells of bread and a grassiness.  Taste: First thing that hits the tongue is hops. A some what citrus flavor probably from the hops. As the beer warms I am picking out a slight malt taste that balances the hops.  Mouthfeel: Smooth Mouthfeel. Just the right amount of carbonation. Very refreshing.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. Could have a few of these in a sitting.  My first victory beer and I found it very enjoyable. Look forward to trying their other beers.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

S - Light crisp with the czech hops barley comeing through  T - Has a light citryusy taste from the hops, but other than that the malt is very light. Barely any real strong decisive flavor at all.  M - Light bodied. little carbination to disturb the palette.  D - Definitley a session beer for anytime of the year.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jaluria,4.06,"A golden beauty with very minimal head that remains for just a few seconds. Excellent carbonation that gives the impression of champagne. Aromas of yeast, malt, grains, and hops. The taste is an excellent example of this style with it's crisp, bitter taste upfront followed by a dry finish. Hop bitterness dominates the malt, but both flavors are detectable. The carbonation simply addes to the dry, hop profile. The aftertaste is quite bitter, but not unpleasant or overly dominant. A refreshing beer with good taste. I can easily have a few of these.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,cracgor,4.83,"Bright golden/yellow Beer. perfectly transparent with lots of carbonation. Smells sweet malty with some piney hops. It is a little sour smelling. It really smells like a pilsner...not much more to it. The hops hit you first. quite piney. The sweet malts take over at the end. It is a straightforward beer and well balanced. A little astringent, but not in anyway that takes away from the beer. Light to medium body. Very drinkable. Everything about the beer makes me want to take another drink.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ClearDog,4.5,"Appearance -- Pours a transparent light gold. Nice foamy, pure white 1-finger head. Small carbonated bubbles are visible. This beer looks very good in my glass mug.  Smell -- Very pleasant hop character. Hints of green grass. I find it to be very interesting for this style. This pilsner has balls.  Taste -- Clean and crisp taste, but not too light. It has character. The hops come out very nicely, but are nowhere near overly bitter. They are balanced out nicely with the malt. This is bar none the best tasting pilsner I've ever had.  Mouthfeel -- Light, but not as light as a typical beer of this style. This one has a good feel to it.  Drinkability -- Indeed very drinkable. I'm surprised by how much I like this beer. I pretty much wrote-off the pilsner style as being boring; boy was I wrong. I can see myself drinking a few of these every so often. I will be coming back to this beer very soon.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Grassy, floral notes.  Tastes great for a lighter beer. The hop and malt balance is exceptional and doesn't break down at all. The malty sweetness shines through the great hop flavor. This beer maintains a consistency throughout.  Mouthfeel is good. For a lighter style, this beer holds its own and even gives you an impression that it is much thicker than it is.  Drinkability is fantastic. This is a great session beer, especially when the weather is warm.  Prima Pils is always in my fridge.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ahking,4.52,"After seeing this beer on several top pilsner lists, I finally found it at my local market. After taking my first sip, I realized why. Pours a hazy but bright straw yellow. This tells me this beer has not been refined over and over just to make it clear like budwieser or miller lite. Nice white head that fades quickly, but leaves traces of its self all down the glass. Crisp and clean this beer bites your tongue with a nice hoppy edge, but not overdone. So refreshing and drinkable! Floral hops blend well with malt character. I won't often say this, but this is better than almost every pilsner I ever drank in Germany and Eastern Europe. You have to praise the guys at Victory and all great free-thinking American brewers who never limit themselves. Prost!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,assurbanipaul,3.55,"Pours a light sparkling yellow-gold with a medium white head. Aroma is light and sweet hops, just slightly grassy.  Taste is a bit corny, sweet light malt. Sweet body with a hoppy bite that follows the flavor. A nice dry Saazy sharpness lingers into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is very light and drinkable.

345,1010,Naes,3.82,This one is a clear golden color with a small white head. The aroma is grassy and has a bit of citrus as well. Flavor is mildly malty and has a little bit of hop presence to balance it out with a slight bitterness in the finish. Mouth feel is light bodied and highly carbonated.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,SkeeterHawk,4.42,"Appearance: Pours a very clear pale yellow straw color with a small head of tight white bubbles at first pour. The beer was well carbonated with lots of bubbles sticking around the glass, and there are quite a few bubbles rising to maintain the head, but it didn't stick around all that long. There is a tad of laceing on the glass when drinking.  Aroma: Lots of fresh floral hops in the nose to greet you at first. As the head settles a bit, you can definitely pick out some of the sweet malt presence.  Taste: Boat loads of hops lead the flavor profile, with a fresh floral aromatic flavor. The aroma is so intense that it just leads into the flavor. The hops shine the entire time at the beginning of the flavor. Somewhere in the middle, there is a bit of Sulfur and malt to shine it head just as the bittering hops take over and lead well into the finish. The balance is definitely tipped toward the bitter at the end, yet there is enough girth to the malt to keep it from being over powering.  Opinion: Now this is an anomaly of beer in my opinion. It definitely has the malt presence of a true Pilsner beer, while the hops is probably more assertive than the most hoppy Northern German Pilsner that I have tried. If I were to guess, this is pretty close to a hopped up version of Jever Pils. Yet Jever has a bit more sweet balance in the finish. This is still a mighty fine beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,HardTarget,3.43,"Bottle Inspection: Standard 12 oz brown bottle with a best by date of Jan 29 06  Aroma: Mineral aspect to a pretty straightforward light malt aroma. No hops noted  Appearance: Painfully clear almost watery yellow glass with diffuse carbonation streams feeding a white cover.  Flavor: Oh, there are the hops! German and/or noble hops, more of a bittering hop than a flavor hop, but appropriate to style. A hint of a citric rind deep in the flavor: maybe a bit of grapefruit rind, but not juicy, dried grapefruit rind. Funny how I got all malt in the nose and all hop in the taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, full, almost too firm carbonation, dry finish.  Overall Impression: A quality pilsner. In the style of Urquell but with a bit more assertive hop presence. For all the bitter, it doesnt pucker. I think the carbonation is a touch high and the transparent appearance kind of throws me a bit, but a quality beer none the less. I cant see this being a session beer; its scratching my beer itch pretty quickly.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,GnomeKing,4.22,"You'll know if you'll like it before you taste it. The smell is that strong and distinct. Grainy flavors. A hops smack stonger and sharper than just about any pils you've tried. Some subtle hints of sweet and tart fruit. This is highly drinkable in the sense that you'll want to have more, not in the bogus sense that it's so, ahem, bland that it doesn't put up any fight going down. This beer is soft and light on the palate, but it's also interesting and for real for real. Probably my favorite Pils. If you have macro-swilling friends, this might be a good crossover beer to shove down their naive palates, or it might just be more than they can handle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,burnstar,4.35,"Pours a clear light straw with a big thick white head and excellent lacing. Smell is herbal hops and grassy with some lemon notes. Tastes very hoppy, mostly herbal but with some spiciness. However there is also enough bready malt to provide some balance. This beer has a very nice clean but substantial mouthfeel.

Fresh mowed lawn.  T- Awesome! Biscuity. Fresh bread. Nice malty balance. Spicy hop. Light bitterness in the finish.  M- Good mouthfeel. Crisp, clean. Great dry finish.  D- Outstanding.

Crisp aroma with spicy saaz, fresh floral hops, and a bit of lemon sitting on top of light pils malt sweetness. Malty sweetness just balances out contributions from the hops. There's an oily hop bitterness that's quite forward and carries through the finish. Hop flavour is citric and floral with just a hint of spiciness that kicks in towards the end. Light body with moderately high carbonation, but this beer doesn't come close to feeling watery. The texture is a bit slick and there's just a little residual sweetness that keeps the finish from drying out too much. This is a very refreshing beer packed with hops. Definitely my kind of pilsner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Nose is very hoppy, with bright, grassy, citrus notes--very delightful. Flavor is crisply malty with more delicious hop flavor, grassy, spicy, herbal. Moderately high bitterness interplays perfectly with a cracker-like, biscuity malt. Finishes very dry. Texture is sharp and distinct with a medium-light body.

Smell: A strong malt smell ,grains, and a slight hint of citrus.  Taste: Dry, Sublte hop taste followed by malt in the back end. More comparable to the imperial pilsners i've had than to other pilsners.  Mouthfeel: Light body. Somewhat creamy taste up front due to the excellent lacing that lasted till the finish.

Taste is mildly sweet and creamy with a sold hit of hops to the tongue at the beginning. Tasty and much better balanced than I expected from it's reputation for being a hoppy Pilsner. Remains an excellent well made Pilsner all the way through.  Good mouth feel.  Outstanding drinkability I could drink this all the time except there was only one case of this at the Pasadena BevMo.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,nortmand,4.89,"Wow! Pours straw yellow, with a longlasting white head and some nice lacing. Slightly fruity, watermelon citrus smell. Sage possibly as well. Up front, a nice, mellow maltiness that sustains through the whole tongue. Even with the malt there, after the first hit, this beer is all about the spicy saaz. Awesome bitter spiciness from mid tongue back, which leaves a crisp bitterness long after the swallow. Smooth, bubbly and delicious, this is an awesome pils and is extraordinarily drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Looks like the proverbial ""Beer"" you see in cartoons and on TV. Aromas of hops, malt and sweet earthiness fills the nose. Very nice. Taste is delectible; hops, malt, sweet spices, citrus and floral notes fill the palate, all the while remaining smooth and crips. Light mouthfeel is refreshing and smooth. A high level of drinkability is found here, as this brew could easily be a session beer or a cross over point for many macro drinkers to see the light of day in a craft brew world.

Taste: Big malty flavor to open it up with a sweet and fruity wave to follow. Some orange blossom honey and bready crispness. The middle has a dense and lingering citrus hop flavor. The ending is long with a surprising alcohol taste and a sweet vegetable finish.  Mouthfeel: Well carbonated and smooth, a bit watery and sandy and sticky at the end.  Drinkability: This is a good pils but I had heard so much about this beer I am kind of disappointed. The maltiness is full and crisp as expected from a pils with a nice hop flavor. Certainly nothing to complain about, but I expected more from the number one rated beer for the style (as of today).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

I'm now deep into the second sixer and its truly a spectacle that must be consumed regularly.  Poured into a pilsener glass at medium strength it comes up with a nice slightly off white light bodied head supported by an array of carbonation. sniffed some hop presence as well as some subdued wheat.  Yummmmy. Every drink has enough ummmph that the taste doesn't get boring. Hops were much more dominant in the taste than I expect for this style and I love it. Its not as refreshing as most pilseners as its really a dry middle and finish. Yet the body at first has a wet feeling on the palate. It quickly is smacked around by the dry hop presence. Addicting qualities to this beer as I had to ration its goodness.  Highly reccomended pils and at a fair price for this much quality.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Mitchster,4.47,"Pours out to a sparkling clear pale straw golden, forming a soft white head with good retention and lacing. Carbonation is moderate-strong. Mouthfeel is zippy yet smooth, and finished with a slight astringency, making this one very easy to drink. The aroma is very soft with a traditional Saaz nose, freshly mown hay, and delicate pale malts. The taste is initially floral and spicy with Saaz, followed by a subtle grainy pale malt body, nicely balanced with a moderate bitterness. The aftertaste is bittersweet and haunted by spicy hop overtones. Very flavorful and an excellent example of the style.

345,1010,BrinkyBeerBoy,4.7,"I'm not gonna write a long review about this one. Because we all know how great it is!  Love the Noble Hop bottle. Proud to say that Victory is local. I get very excited when I make my round to this Brew.  Pale, straw gold perfection in appearance, and on top, a solid as a rock tight 2 inch white foamy head, that if you look real close you'll see the aroma vapors rising above the glass.  Great lemon citrus, floral hop aroma topped with bread&butter. Perfect nose, very clean!!  Take a mouthfull, and endure a brilliant crisp, hay hop oil that coats the palate, and DOES NOT go away. The sweet grain backbone is wonderful, and is a good balance to this Noble Hop pils. Small head travels all the way down as I swirl the Brew to find more aromas. As this Brew warms launches more of a sweeter hop twang which is incredible!!!  Damn near flawless Brew!!....Extreme American version of a Pils.  '' That smell.... you know that NOBLE HOP smell... smells like...Victory!!  Rucksicht Bier!!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Gaisgeil,3.78,"A very distinctive pils, definatly a more aggressive take on the classic German original.  Pours a crystal clear gold in color with a thin fizzy white head that had little retention. Nose is super clean, but with a nice floral hop aroma. Taste is also very clean and a little dry, quite hoppy though for the style, not overly bitter, but flavorful but remains light and crisp. A nice lightly bready malt backbone balances out the affair.  This style tends to be a bit subtle compared to the huge beers that are all the rage these days, but subtlety is nice sometimes, especially in something like this, definatly a session candidate. The nice hop profile makes this a nice bridge into the style for someone like myself who is used to drinking more over-the-top offerings.  Slàinte!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Rastacouere,4.77,"Beautiful golden body, clear with a huge rocky and foamy pure white head. Aroma is grassy, full on Saaz: spicy and flowery, herbs and bready hay. Milder than expected, but I love the saaz here or maybe it had been too long since I last smelled it. Tongue-biting body, airy, creamy, great support fom a good medium body. Malt bite early on, in a honeyish fashion, but most of the flavor development is all about the flavorful saaz that makes us believe were actually chewing on flowers and some lemon peaks. Something makes me say hallertau too, but Im no expert at picking hops used. Extremely refreshing and crisp. Wonderful beer for a hot day. Re-tried on tap at the Gingerman (NYC) and I was very impressed once again by the fragrant hoppiness of that one. Bottles dont keep their freshness very long, but this particular pint was vibrant with floral, herbal, spicy hops that overcame the soft, biscuity malts. Immensely dry and satisfying to me hence the score bumping up.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,mjohn27603,4.17,"Pours almost clear very pale gold out of bottle. Not much head, it goes away very quickly. Nice aroma that reminds of Pilsner Urqel (sorry for the spelling). First sip reveals a nice smooth lager with some hops bitterness detectable. A bit of meat on this pilsner not like a watery lager. It could use a little more malt taste. A fine alternative to Czech pilsners that don't survive the trip over the seas.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Oxymoron,4.25,"Victory first introduced Prima Pils with 2 other beers in NC, sampled at Tylers on the first day it was available. Pours a very vibrant yellow color with a clear complexion, good head retention and limited lacing. The smell was sweet with citrus notes and some herbal scenes as well.  The taste was crisp, dry and hop. No skunk flavors and very easy to drink. A great malt backing with a good mix of malt that has more of an American style feel. The hop is very floral and crisp. The malt is the stronger of the two flavors. I think that what this beer has going for it is that it is super easy to drink, the flavor is smooth with out the European skunk and its easy to get.  Not only did I sample this as soon as I could (per NC, oh and Pop the Cap was still in effect), I picked some up for later. A great example of a pilsner, or at least a pilsner on vacation in America.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,SwillBilly,4.47,"Served from a 12 oz bottle.  Appearance: Pours a very light pale gold into my Pils glass. Nice, foamy, 1/2 inch head that turns into a some spider web like lacing on the glass.  Smell: Initial hints of fresh grass, herbal, faint grapfruit rind aroma.  Taste: Starts very clean with very light malt, again almost herbal begining that finishes with a great hop bitterness that rounds out this top notch Pils.  Mouthfeel: Extremely crisp, well carbonated, somewhat thin.  Overall: What a great beer, this one of my overall faves. The 1st time I had a Prima I didn't really care for it. However, its now one that I enjoy year round. Very crisp and clean, extremly sessionable, don't limit yourself to drinking this fine Pils only when its hot, its a damn good beer anytime of the year. Another staple of my beer fridge.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,baugherlager,4.27,"Yellowish straw color, Head that collapses into a thin white film.  Nice hop aroma with a hint of grassiness.  Taste starts very clean and crisp but then you quickly get hit with the hops. Not super hoppy but a nice amount of citrusy and piney hop flavor.  Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing with a light body.  This is a drinkable beer, no problems having another.  One of the few micro pilsners that I found most enjoyable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,HopGoblin,3.88,"12oz bottle with drink by date of Nov 21 05  Pours light and golden with a bright white two finger head that lingers around for quite a while. I did not notice much of a nose with the exception of a light hop aroma. Taste is bright, crisp, and clean with a great hop backbone and hints of malt. Body is light with a long hoppy finish. A great brew from Victory and a great session beer. A favorite of mine for a hot summer day.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Bleedingshrimp,4.28,"Prima Pils produces a nice finger and a half head of eggshell foam. Pristine and golden. The head fades leaving a ring and lace that clings sporadically along the glass. Smell is faint with hints of hay and apple. Mouthfeel is light, crisp carbonation and dry. Taste is light toast and biscuit malts. A tiny bit nutty, with a light but lasting hop finish. Drinkability is amazing. The most refreshing beer I've ever had. I could see myself sucking down a case of these on a hot summer night. It's THE perfect summer beer and what any Pilsner should aspire to be.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,oggg,4.03,"12oz bottle from South Bay Drugs in Imperial Beach, CA. $7.99 for a 6pack. Drink by 10/05  I should first start off by saying that I haven't tried many good pilseners, Bitburger probably being the only one I enjoyed back in the beginning when I wasn't a hophead. Now that I can take the hop bitterness, I was a little worried beforehand that the beer would be tasteless. Let's see, shall we?  I poured this chilled pilsener into a regular pint glass and admired the pretty small bubbled white foam gather just less than a fingerbreath before settling to the edges of the glass. The hue is pale pale yellow. What some might call copper. So pale yellow that it starts to look green in the light. Brilliantly clear with no sediment. The aroma of German nobles hops is significant but just not as inviting as that of a double IPA. On the tongue, I first get sweet malt, then a potent dose of fizziness melding with a firm hop bitterness. The beautiful pilsener malt begins to surge. Very clean and smooth except for the high carbonation, which settles as the beer warms. The finish is mostly dry. Medium bodied. Alcohol warmth noticeable at the very end.  Overall: The hops and the malt are in great balance and in large quantity!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,maek228,4.54,"A true pilsner.  Appearance: straw yellow with a one finger head. Pretty average here  Smell: Wonderfully full and leafy hops. Fresh barley, grains, malts all present as well.  Taste: Fresh carbonation and clean German malts lead to the full hop kick at the end. This hop kick is a without a doubt more hoppy than your average pilsner, which I love. Victory is a brewey who does it big and this is a reflection of it. This is my favorite Pilsner and the one that all others should be judged by.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and fresh  Drinkability: Top notch  Again, this is the Pilsner that all other should be judged by",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,rousee,4.11,"Pours a clear gold color with a very impressive head of frothy lemon merengue pie like cap-- 2 finger thickness. Holds quite well. Smell is malt with some standard pilsener hops (Saaz?). There is an earthy quality on the nose also.  Taste is that of a real solid gold colored beer. Nothing fancy here, just clean malt with some more pilsener hops. There is a slightly skunky character but it is very subdued. It does have a lemony finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and tingly. A little on the sour side but pleasant. Extremely drinkable beer. Seems like it would be very versatile for pairing with food. I think I may actually prefer the bottled version on this one but this draught is quite good too.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,sopor,4.1,"Light golden yellow with slight haze. 1-finger head in my 12oz pilsner glass. Lots of bubble action makes for good head retention even though it stays real thin and rocky.  Very slight hops bite smell.  Floral hoppy dry & slightly bitter allows just a hint of biscuity malt to come through.  This beer is extremely refreshing and light, crisp.  I would love to have better access to this beer, I would always have some handy for a hot summer sunday.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Chadbrew,4.6,"Appearance - Brilliant clarity and a bright yellow beer. There is very little head which is a bit of a surprise, but there does seem to be good carbonation. Aroma - Mostly the aroma is malt, really excellent and clean with nice light hints of yeast and hops. Taste - Smooth and malty with a touch of sweetness. The finish is crisp and slightly bitter... real nice. Body and Drinkability - Great on both counts. The body is light without being thin and really there is nothing about this beer to get tired of.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Smell = Robust malt and hops presence. All those crappy American lagers wish they'd smell even 1/2 this good.  Taste = Amazing. Refreshing, flavorful. Not watered down at all. There's a great bitter hop aftertaste that follows a tiny bit of sweetness. Perfectly balanced. Delicious, powerful hops flavor. I could polish off a 6 pack without even blinking.  Overall = An outstanding beer and by far my favorite pilsner. Would fit very well on a hot summer BBQ or any warm day when you're quite thirsty. I'd never turn on down and highly recommend you try it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,malty,4.45,"Enjoy by: Sept. 30 '05  Pale yellow in color with crystal clear brilliance. Bright white head that descends to a thin, tiny bubble blanket. Great lacing.  The scent of this beer is very bright and fresh first off. Lemon grass and hay. Crisp hop aroma hovers above the faint (but apparent) soft malts.  The flavor replicates the scent to a 'T'. Zesty fresh hops engulf the tongue with a perfect balance of somewhat bready malts as the backbone. A light sweetness arises from the clean dry flavors, which remind me of homemade sugar cookies - daddy likey.  Mouthfeel is superb. Kinetic, fine carbonation, which makes the light-med. body dance across the tongue. Graceful long dry and oh so faintly sweet finish.  Drinkability is top-notch. Couldn't imagine when or where this fine beer would get tiresome.  Overall a splendid rendition of a very difficult style to nail. I adore the hopped-up approach this beer is noted for. The awesome balance of the dryness-to-sweetness is unmatched. The only thing I'm not happy with is that it's taken me so long to get my hands on some. Move over Sierra Summerfest and Dortmunder Gold, Prima is taking the top bunk.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,metalitool,4.97,"Simply one of the best beers I've ever had, no question. This one will catch you off guard....very light in color, it tastes far different.  With a pronounced hop flavor that hits you in the tongue, then disappears, it gives you a strong taste, with NO aftertaste AT ALL, only to leave you wanting more...dont be surprised to see it disappear quickly, even when you aren't aiming at consuming large amounts.  I have yet to have anything else like it...no aftertaste at all (clean), pronounced hop flavor, and superb drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Ricochet,3.95,"Darker yellow, almost a wheat beer in appearance. Smelling a little like lemon, with not much else. This was different. Mouth was better than average for yellow burp beers, because this rose above.  A very good sixer. Why aren't all pilsners this good? I haven't had any truly ""german"" pilsners other than ""Old German"" which this it is not. Bitter just a bit with rounded grainy flavors and made this better than anything you buy from BMC or even some micros. Again, this is not my preference in beer types, but if I want something light with a lot of flavor, I'll look for this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,lackenhauser,3.92,"Gorgeous golden color-positvely flawless in appearance. Low carbonation level. Low aroma. Some sweet malt. Almost a trace of citrus. Good malty flavor-very clean tasting.

Damn good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,sabrills70,4.15,"Pours a medium light gold with a huge head, great longevity and great lace. Smells of a sweet malt with a spicy hop presence - exactly how a pilsner should smell. A sweet malt first hits fllowed by a spicy earthy hop flavor and bitterness. A bit to hoppy - I think. A bit out of balance. I realize that they are supposed to be a bit hoppy but its just a too much for me. Upon a second sip I detect some citrus and grassy flavors. A excellent example of the pilsner style, but just a bit too hoppy in my opinion. Still a quality and tasty beer though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Luigi,4.8,"Light golden yellow color with a big foamy head. Great looking lacing and head retention. Smells nice and hoppy. A banquet of spicy of floral hops hit the nose with a bready malt in the background. The taste is absolutly delicious! Spiced with hops to perfection. Pine like bitterness hits the tounge first and then evens out to a softer floral flavor. It's like the hops are in a tuga-war with the malts because the malts are trying to keep the hops in check. Dry hoppy finish. Smooth medium body and perfect drinkabilty. Damn this is good drinking. I love a great pilsner during the summer time, but this one threw me off guard. True to the style but a lot hoppier. This could be one of the most delicious pilsners I have had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,monkeybutler,4.58,"Pours a pale golden, with a good frothy head and carbonation. Smells of those crisp clean lager flavors with citrusy hop overtones. The taste is dead on, very clean and tasty with a nice mouthful of hops. Great mouthfeel. Drinkability? I'm drinking it until the temperature drops below 70 degrees here in Philadelphia.  Awesome pilsner. Has no equal on this side of the pond.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Zraly,4.17,"Pours a pale gold with a rocky white head. Minimal head retention, though. Smells of fresh garden herbs (parsley, cilantro) and noble hops permeate the initial impression, which is rather pleasant and delightful.  Wow! What a hoppy flavor, which isn't something I am accustomed to when it comes to an American-made pils. There is a slightly sweet backbone of malt flavor coupled with a cracker-like nuance, that is followed by a huge zing of hop flavor. The finish is nice and dry, with a clean smoothness. Very crisp and fresh in its overall presentation.  A nice change of pace and a perfect summertime brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,watermelonman,4.35,"This poured to a light gold yellow with a large head that slowly shrank. Lacing disappears quickly.  The smell is somewhat floral with light malts underneath. The taste is quite good, being light yet full of flavor. Hops come through in a solid fashion but do not disrupt the rest of this beer. The mouthfeel is pleasing while the drinkability is very high.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,cubedbee,4.17,"My bottles says enjoy by 4/2/05, but I've been drinking them and they taste fine to me. Pours a clear straw color with a finger of white head that dissipates pretty quickly to a ring. Nose is pretty hoppy--both floral and citrus coming through over a sweet malt. Taste is a refreshing light malt with an aggressive grassy hop finish, with some caramel and lemon notes coming through here and there. Bitterness lingers for a while after each sip. Medium bodied, this beer has a nice crisp mouthfeel.

The head fell quickly, but settled leaving about a 3/8"" cap that lasted through the whole glass. The brew had a light straw color and a clarity that could only be attained through filtration. A hefty amount of Saaz was detected in the nose, likely from dry hopping, and this German Pilsner also had a liberal amount of hops in the taste. I am happy over all with this brew; it pours clean, has enough head to keep its carbonation, and has a good serving of Saaz.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,charlatan,3.89,"I'm not a pilsener man, but this was a balmy evening, I had reviewed every other craft beer at my Monday haunt and I fancied something refreshing for a change.  The head dissipated quickly while I was trying to make the colour out (possibly straw) in the dark, smoky premises which also affected my nasal test. I did pick out a surprising citrus tone though.  This was the best tasting pilsener I have downed. It was crisp, although would have been better with a little more carbonation. Its wonderful hop flavour mixed well with a subtle sweetness, and there was a slightly creamy element too.  I was pleasantly surprised.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Wonderfully light and refreshing... strong hues of lemon and some grassy overtones.... what a Pils should taste like. A healthy dose of hoppiness comes through in the aftertaste  Mouthfeel: Very crisp, very clean.... great on a summer day.  Drinkability: It should be a sin for a beer to be this quaffable....

Onto the beer....poured a yellow-gold with a nice head. Has a large amount of carbonation, although for once, in this beer, that didn't bother me like it often does. The carbonation was easy to deal with and didn't seize my throat or bloat my tummy like some highly carbonated beers.  Smells of metal and earthy/spicy hops arch off the head, and the hint of perhaps centennials hops as well? Far hoppier in the nose than a typical pils, even Pils Urquell, which is a favorite of mine. I could have sniffed this one much longer but was drawing funny looks from the tables around me.  Tatse and mouthfeel are exceptionally crisp and sharp, but in a good way. Very smooth malt flavors blend with the hops all the way through the sip and the yeast stays apparent, although in the background, providing a lager-ish finish. Simply put, a supremely refreshing and quenching beer ever. Victory has done it once again, this time bringing hops to a style where so much hops isn't expected, and still making it work well.  Exceptionally drinkable. Brought home a sixer of this and Avery IPA from NC and have loved having both around.  Wish GA would get Victory and Avery in sometime soon...

345,1010,Ego,4.15,"on the eye... lovely white head of 2 fingers holding at one finger quite nicely, pure straw clean looking hue, nice carbonation apparent  on the nose... usual pilsner bready malts but ah they are over matched by hop floral goodness... smells like a good euro pils except with a flowery bite, there is a definite breadiness to the malt represented here, very nice  taste et al... the carbonation lets it flow over the tongue nicely, the flavors become more apparent as you sip on, malty bread, hop aftertaste (no ""bite"" like say sierra nevada pale ale, not a complaint mind you !), the malt gives it a nice honey twinge (maybe even a hair of lemon flavor is in there as well from the hops?), needless to say this is tasty for a pils, I dont find it uber challenging or anything.. if anything it might be milder than sam adams or sierra pale but it has a nicer balance than those 2 imo.  verdict the pils for the beer snob having a pool party, very good on a hot sunny day being lazy by the pool, I'll definitely be picking up more of this during these summer months",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,neonbrown82,4.52,"This beer poured crystal clear yellow into my pilsener glass with a tall, creamy, cascading head. Has a great carbonation, though head retention and lacing seem to be minimal.  The smell is great. As a true pils should be. It smelled hoppy as soon as I popped open the cap. Smells very noble with even a subtle bit of american hops tucked away (cascade, centennial?).  One word can describe this taste perfectly: crisp. The smooth maltiness matches well with the bitterness and fruity/flower flavors from the hops and yeast. It all comes together perfectly for one of the most refreshing light beers ever. I must say, I was expecting this beer to be overhyped, but I'm a believer. It's a pils that has a taste of epic proportions yet still tastes like a pils.  The mouthfeel is once again quite crisp. The hops have quite the spicy bite and dry bitterness. Very well done, and VERY highly drinkable. It's a shame I can't get more of this to share with some of my schwag-beer drinking friends.

Taste: Herbal hops up front with a very pleasant caramel sweetness to balance it out. The finish is medium in duration and dry... and is that nutmeg? No, but something herbal and interesting.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, dry texture, moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: Just enough character to keep you interested without making it to loud.

Smells of grassy and zinging hops (Saaz, probably). A gentle malt is also present, but way below the floral of the hops. Tastes bitter hoppy with some zing to start. Sharp and a bit of metallic. The middle is predominently malt sweet with honey qualities...perhaps a hint of caramel. The ending is another hoppy burst. A bit more floral, but still with the metallic quality. There may also be some hallertauer flatness in the aftertaste. Medium body, mildly carbonated, and great lacing on the inside of the glass. Really nice beer and quite drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

There was a great non-overpowering hoppiness in the mouth. The finish was very clean, very dry. All in all, a very beautiful beer. Someone needs to remind me why I used to pooh-pooh this beer. I feel as though I am born-again.

345,1010,thechaacster,4.05,"Pours a pale gold with two fingers of foamy head. Good head retention along with lots of sticky lacing. Big nose of herbal hops gives a hint of what's to come, if the giant hop cone on the label didn't tip you off.  Take a sip and you get an immediate attack of herbal and citrusy hops. This is a lot more intense than any other pilsner I've had. A touch of sweet malt keeps it from becoming overwhelming, although I wouldn't call it balanced. Still, remarkably smooth and drinkable. Even though I tend to be a bit of a wuss when it comes to the hops, I found this to be a delicious beer that would be suitable for damn near any purpose.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,UncleJimbo,4.3,"12 oz brown bottle, with a date on the label.  This pils poured a slightly hazy, golden color with creamy, white foam that persisted and clung to the glass a bit in clumps. The smell was dominated by hops with both bitter hops and light floral hops, together with some malt. The taste was malty and hoppy with some floral hops and some biscuity maltiness. Very nice flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and almost creamy with medium body and good, strong carbonation, especially up-front. The aftertaste was lightly hoppy. This is a delicious session beer, and is perfect for the summer months.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,TongoRad,4.03,"Bottle was dated Sep 03 '05  Poured into a straight pilsener glass this beer is crystal clear pale yellow with a pillowy two-finger snow white head which settles down to one-finger after a minute. A steady stream of bubbles rises from the bottom.  Aroma features a generous dose of hops- partly grassy, partly lemon peel- and a good platform of grainy malt. It is definitely German in nature. Some faint alcohol is present as well.  The hops are really ratcheted up on the palate- a very clean yet substantial bitterness dominates. There is just enough malt to keep things from getting coarse but that is all. The finish is dry and crisp, and the lemon peel hop elements linger for quite a while. As with the nose a touch of alcohol finishes things off. Not exactly my cup of tea, but quality stuff nonetheless.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Beervis,4.15,"Pours a light straw-gold color with a nice thick head. Great lace left on the glass after each sip.  Smell is very floral and very lightly malty. Light to medium bodied mouthfeel with powerful (but not overwhelming) hops and a touch of malt. This beer screams hops in the nose, but is very balanced. Finished almost bone-dry and crisp.  A very drinkable beer, that I bought as a hot weather thirst quencher, but I would drink all year round. The only problem I see with this, is my inability to stop drinking it!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Boilermaker88,4.42,"Served from a 12oz bottle with ""enjoy by 09.20.2005"" on the lower left side of the label. Appearance: bright goldenrod color, generous carbonation, and a frothy white head. Moderate amounts of lace simply add to the pleasing visual. Smell: quite floral and fruity, with some snappy, spicy hops. Decent hay-like malt rounds things out a bit. Real solid Saaz aroma. Taste and feel: wow, big-time hops pop here! Sweetly malty to begin with. Get a nice fruity flavor putting in a brief appearance. Quickly steps aside for a solid counterpointing spicy hops rush. Herbal hops flavor carries over well past each swallow. Medium-bodied, yet fuller than most other pils. High carbonation gives Prima Pils a lively nip to the tastebuds. Overall: so easily drinkable, so superbly hopped! Easily my favorite beer by Victory. Hope that Victory can get some fresh Prima Pils sent out to the West Coast soon. It'll be a DBF staple.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jakester,4.56,"This was a 12 oz. bottle from the sampler pack. Date on the bottle!! Yea!  Pours a brilliant straw yellow with a one finger head of pure white foam. The head drops off to just a few islands in a very short time; my only gripe with this beer. Pretty high level of carbonation evident.  The smell is awesome. If this isn't Saaz, I'll eat my glass! And the aroma from the (German) malt is to die for. Spices and fresh baked bread are blended together. Great aroma!  The taste is just like the smell. Smooth malt followed by a gentle bittering and then that spicy Saaz hop flavor. I wish I was better at describing flavors. The balance is perfect for the style. This isn't an understated pilsner by any means, but...WOW!  Mouthfeel is smooth, fairly soft carbonation, a tongue cleansing crispness, and a long lasting hop presence in the finish. Crisp and refreshing.  If I didn't like IPA's so much, this would be my everyday beer. Not too strong, not too weak, just right. A session beer looking for a session.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,RedwoodGeorge,3.97,"I've been drinking ales for so long I'd kind of forgotten just how good a pilsner can be. In many ways but for one this was an exceptional brew.  The pour was unmistakably a pilsner - clear, straw yellow with a pure white head. The foam died off all too quickly and left only the faintest of rings around the glass.  The smell was just plain yummy - clean, clear hops just begging for a sip. The taste was incredible. My first reaction was ""oh, yeah, this is what a -beer- used to taste like"" There's a nice balance between a sweetish, light bread malt note and a very aggressive hop. This has all the hallmarks of an old-fashioned, true to style pilsner.  For all of the other positives, the mouthfeel was a major disappointment. There was practically no carbonation, no 'fizz' on the tongue. Instead the beer just laid there, flat, like it had been left open overnight. The minimal head was a warning sign and for good reason.  I'm hoping the lack of carbonation is a fluke. This sample was hand carried from the East Coast (thanks rapopoda!) but I doubt that could have caused any problems. I'm looking forward to sampling some more ""Prima"" Pils in the hopes that the next one is more typically carbonated. (if so, I'll re-rate to be fair) It's a shame because the taste was so incredible...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,marcobrau,4.16,"Perhaps the hoppiest pilsner I've ever had. (I swear that this beer had slight green tinge to its golden hue.) The aroma is wonderfully spicy. Hops show themselves quite a bit in this pilsner, but mostly in the middle and in the nose. The bitterness is apparent, but not as striking as one might expect. The malt flavor is crisp and clean. The mouthfeel is smooth and the body firm. Perhaps a bit fuller bodied than most German pilsners that this beer seems to imitate, but what more can you ask for in a microbrewed pilsner beer?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ElGordo,4.07,"Pours a clear golden straw hue with a half-inch stark white head. Nice carbonation. Great nose of sharp floral, grassy hops and crisp, clean lager yeast. Palate begins with more of the same, then develops a sharper hoppiness. Finish is lightly bitter, with light notes of citrus and black pepper. Medium body is standard for a pilsner. An excellent, thirst-quenching beer perfect fora warm June evening.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,beermanbrian,4.1,"Nice light golden color and tons of carbonation bubbles. 1/2"" white foamy head that disipated a little too quickly. Nice malty smell with a light floral aroma and a grassy overtone. Taste starts out with a grassy and slight citrus note that is followed by a nice bitterness for the aftertaste. Well balanced beer, the bitterness dosn't overpower and actually becomes less noticable as you finish the beer. Very drinkable beer especially @ $25/case. Will be on my regular summer rotation.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,kegerator,5,another great offering from victory pours a slightly hazy yellow with some slight golden tones and a decent 1/2 inch head that sticks around for a good while. smell was floral hops up front with hints of malt and bread in the back. taste was a nice blend of the floral hop with a hit of slight citrus and bready earthiness. the beer was clean and crisp and had an almost bready creaminess that lingered at the back of the mouth  very enjoyable,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ypsifly,4.28,"12oz best by 7/24/05 printed on the label, poured into a pilsener glass.  Clear gold with active carbonation that supports a two finger head of white that shows good retention and sticky lace.  Spicy hops paired with biscuity malts, with that pilsener funkiness underneath. Earthy.  The malts are upfront when tasted. Slightly caramel with some husk. The hops come in midway and lead into a dry, but very clean finish.  The mouthfeel on this one suprised me. Not thick in any way, but full and smooth. Not heavy, but my whole mouth feels it.  This is an excellent choice for a session brew, or something to have with dinner. I'm impressed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,palma,4.3,"Good looking pils. Golden body with a decent head. Light hoppy aroma with some grassy notes. A clean refreshing taste with a very strong bitterness. Nice solid body, especially for a pils. This beer scores a high 4.5 for that hop bitterness baby! yeah!

345,1010,CRJMellor,4.1,"Pours light white golden color with big, foamy white head that deposited all kinds of chunks of lace to the glass. Aroma has a really grass and flowered hop aroma with just a touch of malt sweetness. Flavor is full of light bodied crystal and light malts with a full blown grass and citrus balancing hop taste. Really well balanced. Mouthfeel is a little on the full side for style but it's a good twist. Not quite as clean on the palate as expected with just a bit of lingering sweetness. Drinkability is very high. Abolsutely thirst quenching and refreshing. Definitely a bit of an American twist on a great style but well worth seeking out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,yelterdow,4.43,"Freshness date: Sept. 11, 2005.  Appearance: Pours a light, straw yellow with an incredible head. Thick, foamy, rocky, a full four fingers thick into a pilsner glass on this warm spring evening. Great active carbonation adds points to this nice presentation.  Smell is fresh and expressive, the pilsner malts are obvious but not overpowering... grassy and slightly grainy. This should be good.  Taste: Crisp and clean, ballsy for a German style pils... this brew leans damn near into ""uber"" territory. Clean pilsner maltiness with a fantastic, perfectly suitable hop bitterness in the finish. Too good for the lawnmower, I reserve these for the barbecue and by the pool.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied but substantial, terrific for the style. Not the gleaming feature of this beer, but then again, we're talking pilsner. It drinks quite well.  Drinkabilty: At $30.99 a case at Total Wine in River Edge, NJ, this is not my everyday session brew. The hoppy finish has the ability to numb the taste buds a bit after a few bottles, so savor da flavor!  However, when the sun is shining and friends are in abundance, as is almost always the case in the summer months, I make it my business to have a case on hand. Fortunately this is readily available in the area, and it can't be beat for a truly rewarding hot weather brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Backer2004,4.1,"Great German Pilsner that was only $2.50 a pnt last night at the Flying Saucer in Charlotte. Enough head and lacing and tons of carbonation that tickled the tongue. Smooth tasting, with hints of honey and clove. One of the best, if not the best, tasting pilsners I can recall. Though it could be a session beer, I had this last after a long evening of tasting and took a bit longer to finish. Keep cooler than room temperature.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,RockyTopHeel,4.22,"Tasted on tap at Brixx, 6/2/05.  Golden in color with a thin layer of white foam (at least, by the time it reached my table, the head had reduced) and an appropriate amount of carbonation.  Soft, herbaceous aroma with a strong hops presence. Taste is similar, with layers of herbal flavors and crisp, dry hoppiness sitting atop a soft depth of malts that round out the flavor in the mouth.  All in all, I'm very, very happy that Brixx added this beer to their lineup.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,EPseja,4.23,"Served in a pilsener glass at fridge temperature.  A: Light straw yellow, crystal clear. Modest, off-white, foamy head with many different sized bubbles. Steady, hypnotizing streams of bubbles rising from microscopic flaws on the inside of the glass. Relaxing and meditative like watching a fishtank... heh heh.  S: Characteristic clean, sweet pure German pils. Slightly flowery with an aggressive touch of European hops that adds to its seductive nose.  T: Immediate hop hit in the front, slightly uncharacteristic for the style. Clean and lightly malty in the middle. Medium dry, hoppy bitter finish. Pleasant hop aftertaste that makes me (but perhaps not the average pilsener drinker) want another sip.  M: Active and lively without being overcarbonated. Refreshing, however I feel that it could stand to benefit from a pinch less carbonation.  D: This is a supremely drinkable summertime pilsener even if the carbonation isn't the smoothest. I can't find any reason not to reach for another bottle - even after already having a few. Nice job, Victory!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,granger10,4.3,"This beer pours a light golden color with a large foamy egg white head. Head recedes to a small layer above the liquid. Not really any lacing, only a few bubbles rise to the top. Smell is slightly hoppy but more grassy but in a good way. Taste has much more of a hop precense than the aroma. I guess I might be used to the whole dry hopping thing but this doesn't really seem dry hopped. Quite a full body which takes the main stage with a nice herbal element. Hops are nicely noticeable but not stinging in any way. The spicyness of the hops work with the rest of the flavors in near perfect harmony. They just work with the rest of the beer beautifully. Finish has little acidity and lingers with a hop bite. Great beer here, probably the best pils I have ever had. I need to get me some pilsners from Germany and compare but this is damn excellent.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Viggo,4.2,"Pours a nice light golden colour, sparkly with a small head that quickly dissipates. Smells like sweet malt, with a little bit of up front hop bitterness. It's tasty, sweet at the front, pretty full and malty, and a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. Pretty full for a pilsner, lots of flavour and very enjoyable, probably one of the best pilsners out there. Definately a fine session beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jvonkluck,4.85,"Quite simply one of the most drinkable beers I've ever tasted. It's pale yellow in color with a white head and a steady flow of tiny bubbles.

Another solid brew from Victory. These guys continually impress me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,AlexJ,4.22,"I'm not usually a pilsner or lager drinker...ale man all the way. But since Victory is one of my favorite brewers I thought I should give it a try.  The color is clear golden yellow with a light and fluffy head of pure white. Head is quite nice looking and retains well with a modest amount of lace. This would look great in my Trumer Pils glass, oh well.  The aroma is much fuller than I expected with a nice, crisp malt aroma of honey and buttery biscuits. There's a lovely (and quite large) floral hop aroma with a grassy meadow note. Very clean and crisp smelling overall.  The flavor is exceptional for a pilsner. A perfect balance between golden caramel and honey malt sweetness, and floral and grassy hops. Finish is initially malty and quickly washed over by crisp, puckery hops.  Mouthfeel is light and airey yet maintains a full and rich mouthfeel. This is a good beer for any time, any place, or any occasion. Are all micro-brewed pilsners this good?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,freed,4.44,"After getting goaded for not liking this beer, I decided to try it again. Glad I did.  The pour is crystal clear and golden - thin white foam, low carbonation.  Aroma is wonderful. Bready like a SE Asian lager, but with a much nicer, floral hop component.  The taste is great. Not overpowered by Saaz, like the last time. The pils malt is complimented by some specialty. The hop profile is a mix of something noble and something domestic tasting. Slightly bitter but with a perfectly crisp compliment. Also, very drinkable and excellent for beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

The malt flavor in this one is quite unique, taking on some wildflower honey type qualities. The hop flavors are both grassy and floral, and contribute a bracing bitterness to the mix. I'd drink this regularly if it were available locally, and it's inspired me to homebrew a clone of it sometime in the near future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Spicy hop aroma that gave it a unique taste. Very light bodied and carbonated. Slightly dry mouthfeel and very crisp and clean. Definitely a drinkable beer but I don't think this would be my choice to drink all night long.

It's a clear, clear clear pale gold color. Not too much head or lacing to speak of. Smells very fresh with some mild grassy herbal notes thrown in for good measure. This one is definately a beer for pilsner lovers. Crisp hops presense with a pleasant bitterness and a nice clean finish. Has a nice, sharp bubbly mouthfeel that compliments the flavors. Prima Pils would probably be amazing when paired with spicy food. An excellent warm weather beer.

The smell is big, juicy hops with a spicy background, seems like saaz hops and there is a light malt scent in the background. The taste is also dominated by hops, you get a resiny hop oil flavor as well as a citrusy tartness to it. The saaz hops really make themselves felt with a spicy middle followed by a biscuity malt flavor to balance the finish. The finish is dry and refreshing. The mouthfeel is smooth like a pilsner should be.

Once at home,the grill was fired up the steaks sizzling and my reward was a crisp Prima Pils. This beer is balanced and refreshing. It pours a clear pale gold, smells of flowery hops and has a hoppy, tingly taste that beckons you to have another sip. This is a summer beer for sure.  I will be sure to keep extra of this on hand.

Aroma was strongly of aromatic hops, with a hint of spices. Nice.  The taste was mildly fruity, with a hint of bitterness and a bit of spiciness. Pretty dang good.  Mouthfeel... nice. Not heavy, but some depth to it. Drinkability also good.

The head receded quickly, and left a dapple of lace on the side of the glass. I could smell the hops (Saaz?) from 3 ft away. They really dominate the aroma with a crisp citrus character. No malt really comes through in the nose. The taste is a light crisp hop-forward flavor that again has the citrus, a subtle grapefruit character that has an almost earthy tone. This delivers an assertive bitterness to the beer. The malt is completely overcome by the hops. This is not a bad character. Very crisp and refreshing mouth feel. Highly drinkable. What a great summertime beer.

Some grass is noted, as well as citrous hops. Hops immediately bite your tongue and don't let go. Bitter lemon transitions into some interesting spiciness. Bready malt attempts to balance the bold hops. Finish is spicy with some herbal qualities, backed by malty smoothness with some grassiness. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean and finishes quite dryly. Light and refreshing, drinkability is quite high for this one (especially with the approaching warm weather). I was expecting this to be hoppy, but it exceeded my expectations.

Appearance: golden straw color; very clear. Not much head, but that may be due to age (freshness).  Smells of lovely hop aroma (I enoy the smell of hops much more than taste).  Tastes strong hop with out the intense bitterness. Aftertaste kicks in some bitterness, but nice. Nice mouthfeel a bit fizzy. After the first few sips, the hoppiness dies somewhat and you can enjoy more of the maltiness.  Great aperitif, gets you hungry, but fills you up a bit; really hits the spot.  This is a good beer. Its intense hop flavor has me thinking this isn't a standard Pils. I would definitely jump on it given another chance, but not something I'd buy normally.

Grass and herbs. Very hoppy.  The taste is very hoppy, but not powerfully bitter or oily. These are the noble hops that are advertised on the box. They are very earthy, grassy, herbal, and chewy, but not bitter and not palate-shredding. There is some balancing sweetness but I can't say it balances it out completely. This is supposed to be hoppy and it pulls it off spectacularly. Good mouthfeel, nice carbonation and a smooth finish.

It reminds me a bit of a Duvel in the nose (must be the pilsner malts).  Taste is sweet malts up front then immediately followed by the European hops, Saaz, Hallertua maybe. Nice dry finish with the hop lingering for quite a while. This has an outstanding taste that could put this beer at the top of my Pils list. Hell, at the top of my list, period.  Mouthfeel is light crisp and refreshing. It has just the right amount of carbination and goes down smooth.  Drinkability cannot be improved upon. A great session beer with exceptional flavor that will keep me coming back for more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Random islands of lacing clung to the glass.  Honey and hop pings came through in the aroma. Just a scat of citrus impression.  The taste was surprisingly bitter. The first couple of sips acclimated my taste buds to this new and exciting beer I had especially for their delight. Faint lemony flavours showed up in the finish . The hops seemed to outweigh the pilsner malts in the taste. Which was absolutely fine with me. Good, bold flavour and a refreshingly crisp and dry ending.

Taste- Not a sweet as many pils I have tried, but a nice hoppy background. Nice grain taste as well.  Mouthfeel- Very crisp and a bit dry. Maybe a very slight watery taste at the finish.

345,1010,Fish113d,3.85,"Pouring into a pint glass, it pours a straw color (pale gold) with a dense white head that tends to not dissipate too quickly at all, which is nice. Aroma is of citrus fruits (grapefruit) and some hops and spice. A touch of alcohol also hits my sinuses. Taste is soft spice and citrus flavors with a mild piney hop flavor. Sugary sweet grapefruits hit your palete on the finish along with some slightly bitter hops. Overall, this is pretty smooth and silky with some tingly carbonation throughout. Overall drinkability is pretty decent but I tend to not be a huge Pilsner fan.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Billolick,4.3,"12 ounce bottle sampled, comes with freshness dating on the label. Pours a nice shade of quite light golden amber.Snow white head,leaves moderate lacing. Nose is spicy,fresh lemony hops. Medium bodied, crisp and refreshing brew. Loads of resiny and cirtic hops stand out in this bold and flavorful quafer. Great with many foods, fine everyday brew/sessioner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Schwarzbart,4.18,A bright golden yellow brew with nice lacing. Hoppy smell for a pilsener! Taste is very smooth and malty with a nice hoppy aftertaste. An herbal flavor is present throughout which is somewhat grassy with a very mild bread flavor. Mouthfeel is Dry. Overall this beer is very enjoyable and would be an excellent session beer.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,TinusTime,4,"Pours a pale spun gold colour with a nice fluffy white head. Aroma is a little grassy, and spicy. You can tell this thing is gonna have some hops. A bit of biscuit malt shows up but is put back in its place by the hops. Taste is crisp and clean. A subtle malt sweetness gives way to the crush of hops. Grassy, floral, spice are all there in the finish. The beer does stay in some what of a balance however and never goes over the top in terms of hoppiness. Mouthfeel is nice with good carbonation which helps enable a crisp clean mouthfeel. Never does the hoppiness feel heavy. Drinkability is good. This would be great on a summer day sitting on the deck while chillin and grillin. I had not had this in a while and was definitly impressed with the reintroduction.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,whartontallboy,4.07,"Clear gold pour with a thin white head of small bubbles. Smell is malty and grainy with a lots of clean hop scent. The taste itself is grainy and toasty, with a nice dry complexity in there. More hops than a typically expect from the style, but the bready malt flavors are very much to the forefront as well. As drinkable a session pils as you're likely to find; this one is a high point even for Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,orbitalr0x,4.42,"I've been wanting to try this brew for quite some time...thanks to kmpitz2 for the hook up. A very nice bright summer sunshine yellow with a fairly thick white bubbly head on top. Spotty lacing as the head falls. There's a big spicy, herbal noble hop aroma rising into my nose along with hints of sweet grains and some notes of lemon. Quite nice.  A clean, refreshing malt mixes oh so well with the spicy, herbal, slightly floral hop tones...a delicate balance between sweet and bitter. Slight smatterings of bread, lemon and citrus peek out here and there. Lovely..easily the best pilsener I've tried to date.  Medium bodied with a smooth carbonation that floats over the palate. Incredibly easy to drink...this is a damn tasty, refreshing brew. I think this could easily convert some folks to better beer. I will be looking for a sixer soon!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,yeagerbm,4.5,"This may be the best pils in existance. Pours clear gold with a fluffy white head. The aroma is lightly malty with a floral spiciness and earthy hop aroma. The flavor starts off clean with a spicy and fruity hop flavor followed by the appropriate bitterness. The malt flavor is light and clean and the mouthfeel is medium light and very smooth with ideal carbonation. This beer served properly, is absolutely delicious and thirst quenching.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Tballz420,4.25,"This brew is a pale straw color, nice big bubbly white head. Good lace follows that down the glass. Mix of lemony crisp malt and flowery hop on the nose. Crisp grainy malt front, lemon peel and a good level of bittering hops for this style. Fairly creamy, full mouth. Quite a refreshing beer that i will be enjoying after a day of blading this summer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,kmpitz2,4.72,"I've been wanting to try this beer for a while. I finally split a 6er with clvand0. This one pours a nice straw color with a small head over top of the beer. The nose is divine. There is just a hint of lager scent in there, but there is also a really big noble hop presence along with a somewhat grassey malt. I like it. The flavor is also very nice, with a very crisp and clean spicey noble hop that hits first and fades to a really refreshing hop flavor, not bitterness. The malts provide just a slightly sweet background. Wow. So good. The feel is thin to moderate with a lively carbonation. Crisp and clean, this beer will definately make it onto my list of try again beers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,tgbljb,4.47,"poured a beautiful amber color typical of this style of beer. head was impressive. Taste was excellent, every time I drink this beer I like it more. The taste lingers in the mouth and makes you want to try another taste. I'm g lad Victory is close enough to my house for me to always have available",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,TheDeuce,4.68,"Appearance-a beautiful golden color with a beautiful lace and head. Active carbonation surrounds this beer, looks very appetizing.  Smell-Spicy hop aroma, biscuity malts as well but the hops far overshadow everything else. Some alcohol scents, carbonation really evens out aromas.  Taste-crisp with a HUGE hop bite, probably the hoppiest pilsner I've ever tasted, biscuit malts also lend their tastes, finishes with a spicy bite and goes down smooth.  Mouthfeel-crisp, goes down smoothly, hop bitterness at the very end, hoppy aftertaste lingers nicely leaving the drinker wanting more.  Drinkability-excellent, very drinkable pils with more hop flavor that just about any other pilsner on the market and at only 5.30% alcohol by volume you can afford to drink as much as you like without stumbling out of the building.  Overall-a fantastic beer and quite possibly the hoppiest pilsner in the world. Expertly crafted and simply worth all the praise that's been given to it. What more can I say that others haven't. A top notch beer in EVERY respect.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,beveragecaptain,3.85,"This beer pours out a clear golden color with a rocky, white head. High carbonation level. Lemon aroma with honey and a hop spiciness. Crisp, malty flavor. Bitter hoppiness. Fuller bodied than your average pilsner. Tastes pretty good cold, but takes on a slightly bad husk flavor when warm. I remember liking this beer more when I had it about a year ago. Sadly, that's been the case with several Victory beers that I've had recently.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Dithyramb,4.1,"Presentation: Had Saturday night at JDs Smokehouse in Baltimore. It was just tapped and I was probably the only person to order it that day. My first time to enjoy Prima pils on tap, having previously giddily gulped it all summer at the shore  Appearance: Pours a strikingly clear yellow with only a few rows of carbonation on the sides. Lacing was evident throughout the pint.  Smell: Sweet with floral hops Taste: Crazily smooth and drinkable. Has a strong hop profile that is held somewhat in check by chewy malt. Hops kept it slightly bitter, but they were very floral in nature. Not as hoppy as I remember with the bottle version, but still pretty darn tasty.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,gimmehead,4.1,"Appearance: Medium gold with a big bubbly white head and streaming bubbles throughout  Smell: Floral and citric, more intense aroma than I normally notice in a pilsener  Taste: Grassy malts, Saaz hops, slight spiciness and lightly bready  Mouthfeel: loads of carbonation  Drinkability: crisp, light and refreshing; good session beer",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Southernbrew,4.17,"My bottle says best buy 9/11/04, it's now February 17th. There must be a misprint because this beer was awesome, now on to a review.  Pours a lovely golden-light orange, good sized head, nice lacing.  Aroma shows off the hops nicely, some spicy and some floral. A bit of a biscuit aroma comes through as well.  Medium bodied, big hop flavor here. Again, a nice blend of spicy and floral hops as does a nice biscuity flavor. Bitteness comes in in the middle along with a bit of sweetness. Finish is a nice dry bitterness.  Awesome pils, the date had me scared but man am I glad I gave it a shot. A real hop-head's pils.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,mmmbeer,4.13,"12 oz., with ""enjoy by 4/2/05"" on label. Pours into the pilsner glass a bright golden yellow with a 2 finger yead that leaves some lacing. Has a crisp metallic/grassy/grainy hop aroma. The beer has a nice bitterness that lasts and has a grassy/citric/floral taste that is very crisp and refreshing. The malts come through as the beer warms with the slightest hint of caramel. Feels nice and would be a good session beer. Would be easy to introduce this one to macroheads.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,shippos,4.68,"one of my all time favorites  poured witha big froathy creamy merangue like head on a golden colored body. sweet spicy aroma, grassy witha touch of yeast or could be bready malt. smooth delicate taste, good body witha alight sweetness. very solid hop character witha strong but lingering bitterness. I could drink this all day long and never get tired of it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BruceBeerman,4.53,"Excellent German pilsner with more hops then the typical pils from the motherland. Light straw color with nice small head. Very nice lace that clings to glass. The smell is typical pils. But the taste is what seperates it from the pack. They hopped it up. Victory is the king of hopback. But not just for IPAs, it works for pils too. I love the Hallertau hops and this is a little over the top for the average joe six pack drinker. But just right for me as I love hops. This is a good combination of bittering and finishing aroma hops. Very drinkable. Easy to just reach for another. Ok, don't mind if I do.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,ithacabaron,4.16,"From the brewery's tap, into my growler, into my car, and then, a half-hour later, into me.  Pours a perfect bright golden color, with twirling, incredibly small bubbles into my pilsner flute. There is a small, respectable head that soon settles down into the classic pilsner edging. Perfect for the style.  Smell is all Perle and Styrian Golding hops, so clean and clear, and recognizable -- I've brewed with these types, and this is like breathing in the aroma of a fresh bag of their flowers.  Taste is surprisingly mellow -- much more mellow than the bottled version, with a light sweet underbelly of malt for the hops to soak in. This is like drinking each of the elements of the beer separately. The devastatingly clean finish of the lager yeast makes every ingredient apparent, and every one able to be appriciated.  Mouthfeel is good, spritzy yet calm enough to let the brew come into contact with the palate consistently. I would like maybe a smidge of more carbonation, but I'm happy with this.  Drinkability is great -- you could enjoy this all day.  This differs from the bottled version, in that it is less brash and grassy, and more of the ""complete package,"" as they say. It's hard to say which I would prefer -- only that I would love either after a long summer afternoon cutting the lawn. Delicious.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,DESTRO,4.1,"another fine victory brew. a solid version on a pils, its deep golden and vibrant, smells spicy and tangy, a bit hoppy for a ""normal"" pils. taste is much like the nose, lightly sweet grainy malt, lots of spicy hops (yet not overpowering), great balance....crisp and clean, finishes a bit dry. very nice. pilsners have few standouts...but i feel this is one of them. overall a very good refreshing beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,twelvsies,3.18,"Judging by the reviews of others I thought I'd like this beer more than I did. I've recently been more into the not so intense beers meaning less stouts, porters, and double IPAs and more ESBs, lagers, and pilsners. Don't know why, it's just a phase I'm going through. Definately a little dissapointed by this beer though. There's nothing particularly bad about this beer at all, and there's nothing particularly good either. Pours a very light and bubbly clear yellow color, almost like a sparkling cider or champagne or something. Smell is vague but I can detect some spicyness and a light malt flavor. Taste is just a dud. Nothing bad, nothing good. I don't see the hop characteristics in this beer, as many have noted. Just some spicy characters and some bready biscuity malts, but nothing special. I've liked every other Victory brew I've tried, but this one falls short. Unless you're in the mood for a really plain beer, skip this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,hustlemuscle,4.3,"I really like this beer.  Pours a cloudy, golden/yellow, with a light feathery head and vigorous carbonation. It has a robust and tangy nose, hoppy, but clean. It was hoppy, but with that sort of spicy, whit flavor. I liked it very much, but it defy's my limited vocabulary for beers like this. Very easy to drink, with enough 'tang' to make you feel like you are drinking something. Refreshing, even.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,santoslhalper,4.39,"Appearence: Pours a golden yellow color with a nice, little white head. Little signs of carbonation (unlike most pilseners), and little signs of lacing.  Smell: The aroma is absolutly delicious. Fresh floral hops and sweet sticky malts barrage the nose. A wonderful smeller indeed.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Wow. This is a good tasting pilsener indeed. A well-balanced flavor of hops and malts, with a nice crisp bite. A clean and refreshing taste leads to a nice, long lasting aftertaste. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth, but just the tiniest bit slimy.  Drinkability and Overall: This another fabulous offering from Victory. One by one, their beers just knock the styles near dead. This is a great pilsener, almost as good as most imports. A little less crisp than I'd like a pilsener to be, but all in all a great beer I'd have no problem making a session brew out of. Try it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,CAMRAhardliner,4.79,"Wow! This is a kick ass Pilsner.  It pours a deep gold color with a modest head and good lacing. The aroma is awash in sea air hops with a biscuit malt background. The components are very bold and compliment each other perfectly, incredible. The taste is dense mix of hop flavors with a full malt character. Theres a sharp bitterness up front which leads into Saaz ,earthy, floral, fresh mown hay hop flavors. The malt is biscuity and very thick. The mouthfeel is densely carbonated. This is one awesome pilsner, Id say my favorite of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Globetrotter,4.14,"I was thrilled to find this in the singles section of the Total Wine in Northern Virginia in early November, but equally disappointed when I noticed that it was well beyond its ""enjoy by"" date of 9/27/04 by the time I opened it on 11/24/04. Standard brown 12oz bottle with a green and yellow label featuring a big hops cone. No ingredient information.  Pours a clear gold under a one finger white head that is thin and short-lived, leaving just a few strings of lace. The nose is quite malty, with a bit of must in it and a touch of flowery hops. The mouth is light and very prickly. Very good pilsner taste profile, with a solid sweet malt introduction, followed by a significant flowery hops presence, ever so smooth yet delivering just the right bitter bite demanded by the style. The malt fades first, leaving a good bitter sensation at the back of the throat as the liquid disappears. The bite intensifies in the aftertaste, just as it should. Perhaps the head is weak because it is past its prime; nevertheless this is a first rate pilsner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,canucklehead,3.6,This bottle may have been old as there was a lack of freshness to the hops however this was a well crafted pils that has lots of saaz hops and a full midbody. The finish is nice and bitter with a good ability to go with food. I would buy Pilsner Urquell in tall cans instead because of potential freshness problems in the PNW.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,mrfosters,2.86,"Poured a pale gold topped by a foamy head with very good retention.Aroma was slightly grassy with heavy citrus overtones.After everything I've heard about this brew I expected something much better , I was ready for a treat, but actually I found this disappointing.I thought the taste was way too acidic and tangy ,kinda like orange juice.I expect a pilner too be much smoother and more balanced. An o.k.beer ..but just not my taste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,TastyTaste,3.88,"Pours a slightly darker-than-straw color, with a small creamy white head. Grassy malt is very evident in the smell, with a little floral hops. Taste is malt dominated, very grassy, a little skunk, but definitely has a hops presence that the czechs and other euros are missing. Pretty good pilsner, one of the better ones i've had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,francisweizen,4.5,On-Tap at Victory.  A wonderful golden pilsener beer. This brew is a nice golden colour with a good head. The aromas are of fresh german hops and light bready malts in the background. Make no mistake this pils is a hop monster. The taste is hoppy up front and very fresh. The hops have a wonderful floral flavor and they almost taste 'green'. The malt flavors peak their heads around the corner of this brew before the hops pummel your tongue with a drying finish. The mouthfeel is spritzy and medium bodied and the drinkability is excellent to boot. An awesome pils. One of the best!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,NEhophead,3.51,"12 oz brown bottle.  Creamy 1"" white head with very solid retention. Thin and scattered lacing with solid strength throughout the glass. Clear, straw/light golden in color.  Faint lemon and floral hop aroma. An underlying corn, light malt sweetness.  Crisp hop flavors that lead to a firm, moderate bitterness. The corn/grain flavors are what drive this pilsener. Virtually no aftertase besides some floral hops. Nothing outstanding in terms of flavor, but remarkably crisp.  Light bodied; crisp, clean, and refreshing. The mouthfeel on the palate is without a doubt the best aspect of this beer.  Light and refreshing. Again nothing special in terms of flavor, but not a bad version of the style. In all honesty, I'm not a big fan of the style, but Prima is a good version IMO. Worth a try if you like the style; if not, give it a shot anyway, you might be converted.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,NearerMyBeerToMe,3.93,"A meringue-like head of tightly packed, pure white bubbles rushes up the sides of my pilsener glass on the pour. Head recedes very slowly and sticks well. Beer is canary yellow in color with shimmering highlights and exceptional clarity. Full aroma of lemony hops even at fridge temperature; a little warmth brings out a compact, leafy bouquet of lemon rind and wet grass clippings balanced by a slight puffed rice maltiness; finishes with some uric salinity. Lemon and hay flavors fill out the midpalate, with a strong bitterness--but not strong enough to overwhelm hints of starfruit and corn silk. Extremely persistent aftertaste suggests quinine and citric rind. Mouthfeel is light, wet, and very firm. I would rather have this as an apertif than drink it in session. The flavors here have clear affinities with parmesan cheese... ooh, now I'm starting to get some ideas...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,beertaster13,4.14,"The pour wasn't spectacular, looks pale yellow like most lagers and pilsners, the head was more frothy, lacing was nice. The smell has a nice toasted grain and yeast dough, a nice floral and citrus hop are very noticable. The taste is perfect, a nice light grain and toast upfront followed by a great but not overly powerful floral hop, a hint of lemon tingle to the hop as well, light bodied and a very good session beer. This is one of those beers than will convert those big 3 drinkers into craft lovers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jvajda,2.9,"Appearance: Nice, unfiltered look and an enourmous head that sticks around for a while. Be careful pouring this one. Smell: My first impression was of wine-like acidity, but a closer inspection revieled fresh hop tones. Taste: Acidic sourness uncommon in other pilsners I've tried. I like a grassy pilsner but this one is way too grassy. Maybe a result of the whole flower European hops that were used. It has a very fresh malt character that's difficult to describe, but it conflicts with the hops. Good sweetness is welcome. Overall, it's like a mild and lightly hopped fruit-wine. Unique, but not my favorite. A pilsner should be much more subtle than this. Mouthfeel: Light in the mouth with appropriate carbonation. Drinkability: In my oppinion it's way more overwhelming than a pilsner should be, no to mention way more expensive.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Sammy,3.62,"Like a good white wine. Crisp pils with fruit, lemony citrus. Good straightforward pils, for a change. Good hops.Smooth, not much to look at, light yellow with cloudy mushroom head.

345,1010,PatandDavid,3.88,"This was better on tap than my several bottle experiences. Golden in color, I also got a thin white head. I thought there was more malt in the aroma than any hops. Initial taste was of pleasing malt sweetness, with some good flowery hops as well. I did think that dropped out a bit, and I detected some grainy notes in the finish. I also appreciated the crisp carbonation.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Truh,4.27,"Picked a pint of pickled peppers with this one on 7/12/2004. 16-oz. pour at Redbones in Somerville, MA.  Frothy, initial quarter inch head with light lacing through the remainder. Crystal clear and golden with constant action going on, mesmerizing. Applejacks and juicy mango sweetness on the nose; hints of hop character. Crisp and thin body, though thin in this context still means more body than any of the macro-pils. Gentle sweetness and light hop profile make this a devastatingly endearing pilsener, to the point that I would make it an every day selection, well, at least for a pilsener.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jward,4.8,"On the lighter side of golden, and bright, with a fluffy white head. The nose is full and floral, like a bouquet of fresh flowers, which enlivens the spirit. It's presented alongside a pleasant grassy (even minty) aroma. The strong hoppy flavor is somewhat surprising for the style, but works well on top of the bready backbone. The finish is wonderfully dry, clean and very dry in fact, but with spicy, lemony notes that linger on the palate.  This is, I think, a great American beer, one which takes the traditional Pilsener style and transforms it into something new, especially with its bold hoppiness. Especially lovely in the warm summer weather. Don't get me wrong, I love the big beers too. But Prima Pils is my highest rated beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,CBFanWish,4.29,"Everything a good pilsener should be. Fizzy yellow with a moderate white head. The saaz hops were bling-blinging in the house, fo shizzle. It is every bit as good as a true pilsener such as czechvar or boom. I would go as far as saying that it's better. Great stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,tomthumbsblues,3.9,"This Pils poured a very light yellow producing a good head at the top. Small streams of bubbles came up from the bottom of the glass. Smell hinted at fruit, but I could not detect much of anything else. Taste was light and refreshing leaving an aftertaste which was doughy. The mouthfeel was good and I thought the right amount of carbonation was present.  I tried this one back-to-back with another pilsener and I thought this one came out on top. I'd drink another anytime.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,donnebaby,3.88,"Nice-looking uneven head formed out of the bottle and lasted for about 10 seconds. Great resistance. Active in the glass, light gold color. Nose was a rich pils dragged through sweet, powdery flour. Seemed to diminish as I drank.  Interesting oat hop pils taste that seemed to be perfectly round and compact. Mellow grains stretch out from the lasting sweet hopped oat taste. Slightly sweet in the mouth and drying out in the aftertaste.  Excellent pilsener, and one I'll be drinking regularly.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,necoadam,4.35,"Was finally able to find some fresh bottles of this stuff. Pours out a hazy yellow/golden color with a nice head which seems to stay for a while. Smell consists of hops. lemon, some fresh cut grass and some hidden malts in the backround to round it out. Taste consisted of some nice sharp hop bite with an underlying malt backround which balances quite nicely. Just the right amount of carbonation mixes in as well. Had a medium body which was right for this beer. On tap this has to rock hard. Never pass up on this pils, ever.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,NJpadreFan,3,"Victory- Prima Pils  Appearance- Yellow. Bright piss yellow with a decent white head that dissapates after a sip or 2. Smell- grassy hops. Light not too strong. Taste- a very hoppy pilsner, slight bitterness.  Overall- yet another hum-drum Pilsner. Better than most, but this beer would serve its purpose on a Beirut table more so than served up in a glass. At $6.74 for a sixer I think its a little pricey.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,malthead,3.91,"Great appearance, clear amber with a very nice 2 finger white head. Smell is dominated by hops, I can make out the usual pine, with a little citrus, but nothing else. Taste is hoppy, but still balanced. Primarily spicy hops at first, then more herbal as it goes on... very nice. Good mouthfeel, nice level of carbonation. Great drinkability, goes really well with food. Super-hoppy for a Pils, but overall just a really nice beer, even for someone who doesn't like hops too much.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Phyl21ca,2.24,Bottle: Poured a clear golden colored beer with almost no head. Carbonation is really weak which seems to be a problem with some of the Victory that I had lately. Aroma is quite subtle has I would expect of a pils but the taste is way too sweet for a pils. Im guessing they put too much of cascade hops in this. There is some way better pils out there.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,shirfan,3.88,"Hearty golden in color, with a good amount of lacing left from the thin head.  Aroma is mostly spicy hops with a decent malt background.  Taste is well balanced...a medium-sweet malt body is carried by typical pilsner hops profile... lemony, almost sea-grassy, spiced. Excellent drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,mobyfann,4.15,"Paid $7.99 for a 6-pack...  The appearence of this pilsener was pure gold with a medium white head, good retention, good lacing. The aroma was citrusy but more floral than the former.  The taste is smooth and light, another of what I would call a ""light"" beer, regardless of the 5.3% ABV. With that, the ABV is higher than normal for a pils, but this one I felt nothing, it was extremely smooth the whole way, and thus is highly drinkable. Clearly an excellant session beer!  Final Thought: This and Stoudt's Pils rule this country, give it up for the Southeast PA brews...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,crookedhalo,4.52,"Pours a straw pilsener color with a fluffy, white head that sticks around for a bit and then dissipates into a thin layer of lace atop the beer. Real grassy, spicy floral Saaz hop aroma. Decent pils malt backbone evident, too. Very hoppy and dry for a pils, not unlike Jever, yet even hoppier. A bit dry and bitter in the finish which just adds to its drinkability because it demands that one's palate should have another sip. This is not only the finest US-brewed pilsener I've experienced, it competes with its German and Czech counterparts quite nicely. This beer rocks. It is so balanced in all the right places. Pilseners, believe it or not, are one of the hardest styles of beer to brew to the point of exactness (a quality one that is), and, again, Victory's right on target.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,wyllder,4.48,"On tap at the Moan and Dove.  Pours a clear, pale gold, deeper than your average pils, with a 1/4 inch pocked, white head that settles down a bit and leaves a clinging lace along the side of the glass as you go.  Nose is a fresh, summer sawgrass or hayfield smell with a sweet lemon zest hiding in the background. On tap it's bit milder, more open than the bottle.  First hit on the palate is hoppy, less so than the bottled version, but still more agressive than most pilsners. The malt seems to be there quicker off tap, too, balancing it out nicely. Finish is clean, still leaving some sawgrass bitterness, malty sweetness and lemon-zest tang on the palate to invite you for the next sip.  Mouthfeel is clean & crisp. Carbonation is mild but with just enough bite to lend itself well to the flavoring. A little less bite on tap makes this just a bit more pleasant in the mouth, and is the only place my rating changes from the bottled version.  Drinkability doesn't get any better.

345,1010,woemad,3.68,"Ok, I'm going to say right now I didn't expect this to be fantastic, as once I'd gotten this bottle home, I discovered that the 'Enjoy By"" date was ""Jan 11 04."" Wish I'd noticed that before I bought it. In any event, I will try a fresher bottle of this when the opportunity presents itself and alter this review accordingly if I am so moved.  Bottle purchased at Jim's Homebrew in Spokane for $2.29. I had a suspicion from the label (which features a whole hop flower) that this would be a hoppy pilsener.  This beer poured a slightly hazy pale yellow-gold color. There was a moderate sized white head that looked oddly creamy for a pils. Lots of lace left behind.  Smell was a bit skunky. One can probably chalk that up to it's age. It was not so skunky as to block out the high degree of hoppiness in this beer. I bet a fresh one of these would smell great.  Taste, again, was rather skunky. It was mild enough, however to provide my taste buds with proof that a fresher one would probably be noteworthy by it's citrusy hoppiness and it's mildly sweet maltiness. I'm definitely trying the first fresh one of these I find.  I think this is slightly thicker than other pilseners I've had, but it's still somewhat light bodied.  This wasn't bad, even with a little skunkiness. A fresh one of these would probably make a great session beer. It would perfectly suit the kind of weather currently occuring here in Spokane (hot, muggy, etc.).

Very smooth.  Drinkability: I'll have eleven more please. Way too easy to drink. Perfect for summertime enjoyment. Straight up refreshment.  Sidenote: I'm not particularly a fan of pilsners but I tried this because of a strong recommendation from a friend. Since trying it that first time, I've always made room in the fridge for more, especially during warmer months. Also, be sure to drink this as fresh as possible.

Taste: This beer tastes better when it warms up slightly. Some of the flavors are subtle and need a little warmth to come through. The hops are multidimentional. On the back of the tongue, they hit hard with grapefruit bitterness. A very sweet malt makes a powerful showing on the front of the tongue.. This beer turned me off at first, but grew on me at the halfway point (needs warming period).  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: The mouthfeel is ever so slightly thick due to the sweet malt. Good session beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

There is however a steady stream of tiny bubbles constantly flowing upwards, feeding a tiny head.  The aroma is clean, delicate, and hoppy. It does not have any grainy, sour funk like a macro. The taste is a lot fuller when compared to a macro beer. There is a lot to like here with a crisp hoppy bitterness, sweet Pilsner malts with a mellow, mature lager character.  Pilsner is a difficult style to brew a distinguished beer in, but Victory has done it. I wish I had it available here to pass the summers in Hotlanta.

345,1010,JMH_,3.08,"this pilsner is probably one of the more flavourful brews within the style that i've sampled, and probably the most flavourful of those that adhere closely to the style, but it's still nothing spectacular. it pours a moderate golden colour thats a bit darker than many other pilsners. it's a tad less carbonated than a typical pilsner too, which is nice. head is thin and short lived. the smell is a bit buttery and hoppy. the taste is actually pretty good here, solid for a style i'm not particualry fond of, but still nothing to write home about. there's a slight sulfur flavour in the back throughout, which i find to be typical of the style as well. here it was subdued some which was nice. again, this is more in line with the traditional pilsner style. if that's your thing, than this is a brew you'd probably enjoy more than i. give me a hoppy, sweet troegs sunshine pils or the limited rouge 12th street pils any day over this one. a bit of a disappointment overall.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Nice hop aromas, floral and citrus in the nose.  Taste is grassy and with a crisp, bitter hops finish. Floral and hints of grapefruit in the flavor profile. While crisp, the malt is actually a bit sticky in the mouth. I would like the mouth to be a bit more crisp and the stickiness to be muted but this is a damn tasty pilsener anyway.

Poured up crispy clear, yellowy light, scads of bubbles from out of nowhere like a scuba diving team is hidden in the bottom of me pint. Tight white cover that fades to a slick, and slides down the sides. Mixed bubbles.  Scents of wild flowers in a Spring field with a babbling brook breeze. I think some maltiness escapes too.  Flavor is of a true America beer, like an old fashioned beer that Dad drank. There is the flatness of a warmed wheatness a la PBR or Miller High Life, but so as not to offend the VICTORY ilk, I must add its more refined, lemony notes, with smooth easy body, despite the physical initial presence of bubbles, that dies by the third sip.  This pilsner is a watery drinker. If you can dig pilsners, this is ideal due to the robust pilsner flavor, which is an oxymoron of beer sorts.  Last swigs: Pilsners never were meant to set the modern day beer lover tongue world on fire. In that regard, Prima pils is a contrarian offering that balances out most beer fridges with a softer grace of a trad pils that smells and tastes of an American wheaty beer. Highly drinkable due to a naturally tasty watery feel, but bold Pilsner kick.  Beer is good. Happy pils beering.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

On to the review... The beer pours a straw color with a fluffy white head about an inch thick. Head disippates quickly but there is still a white film atop the brew.  Aroma is strong of the Saaz, with a crisp pilsner malt background.  Taste is definitely highlighted by the spiciness of the Saaz hops. Bitterness is there, but there is a malty sweetness present in the aftertaste that's also dominated by Saaz. Very high hop flavor for a pilsner...other brewers should take not. Also taste hints of honey breaking through the malt and hops.  The beer is crisp and light in body. Alcohol is not at all present in the flavor (and it shouldn't be to my tastes for a pilsner).

345,1010,Edwin,3.88,"Appearance - A golden color with a good, white head on top. Left a lot of lacing in the glass.  Smell - I was really blown away by this at first because it was so unusual. My first smell reminded me of freshly cut grass. Then I noticed a tad of a hop scent, but the grassy notes were very strong. Some graininess in there, too. An odd combo...well, at least one I have yet to sample.  Taste - Took me a few sips to get what was in this. I detect hops, but with a maltiness and some sort of foliage type taste in there. The grassy-like taste came through more as it warmed. Very new flavor combos for me. Pretty cool stuff.  Mouthfeel - This is a bitey beer at first. Feels strong as it clings to the tongue. The sips get easier and easier as time goes on, but is a kick upon first entry.  Drinkability - This was an odd flavor at first, but I did pour another right after finishing the first. The combination of flavors was very interesting, and warranted more attention. Low alcohol in this one, so can be consumed rather easily. I'd reccommend it for a new Pils experience.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,stirgy,4.97,"I enjoyed a few of these at the BA rally at Victory. This is a rare and special version of their popular pilsner. It is unfiltered and poured a light and golden straw yellow. It had a touch of murkiness, but retained some of the bright translucency of the regular Prima. White and cream-like head topped this beer off. Beautifully soft and sweet citrus and floral hop aroma. This version loses some of that sharp hop crispness that Im familiar with, but the softer hop presence just seems perfect for this beer. Soft maltiness and ultra smooth on the tongue. Mein Gott! I am a huge fan of regular Prima, and this version really takes the gloves off  as if to say I dare you to try and make something this good!  A wonderful beer on all counts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

In a pint glass, the beer was a hazy straw-yellow color and was topped by a large rocky white head that left wonderful rough sticky tendrils of lacing. The nose was quite lively, consisting of a robustly aromatic orange tinged hop bouquet and a subtle yeastiness. The taste was refreshing, crisp, and bold. The firm bready grassy dry malt base was accented with bitter orange-lemon notes. It finished with a zippy dry orange peel bitterness, with very nice lingering qualities. The body was appropriately firm and carbonated to match the flavor profile. Conclusion: An excellent, nicely hopped pilsner that should please those who normally drink bigger/full-flavored beers. One of my favorite examples of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jtfest,3.7,"In the interest of full disclosure, I should state for the record that this is not my favorite style of beer -- so my review should take that into consideration. I liked the appearance more than many Pilseners. An even, full yellow -- hinting toward the dark side -- with a smallish white head that pretty much disappears shortly after the pour. The aroma is a bit malty-er than a standard pils -- but it still hit my nose with that wet grassy smell that I'm not overly fond of. It had a nice, but not big, mouthfeel, and a slightly sweet taste, mildly carbonated, with little or no aftertaste. For me, this is one of the better of this style -- just not my thing. Easy drinking, though -- it would be a good session beer on a warm summer day.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BuckeyeNation,4.77,"Lucid lemon yellow that isn't quite dark enough to be considered gold or amber. The lid is a shade darker than cumulus cloud white and is soft and fluffy. The foam persists for a while and leaves a small-moderate amount of lace in fat, broken rings. The nose is wonderful: all soft lemony hops with just a hint of earthiness.  Prima Pils is hugely impressive beer and I'm not a big pilsener fan. Hops are dominant, with that same lemon zesty, grassy character that is noted in the nose. This beer is beautifully hopped! It has just the right combination of citrusy flavor and hop bitterness to go along with a fuller than normal body (for the style) and a crisp, drying finish. Another solid beer from Victory.  Prima Pils is, without question, the single best German (American) pilsener that I've ever had. It would be enjoyable at any time of the year, but would be even better, no doubt, on a scorching summer day. Too bad it isn't available around here because I'd never be without it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,99bottles,4.37,"I remember the first time I ever heard of Victory, freshman year in college, the guy who I was talking to was drinking a Prima Pils. I remember because of the spiffy looking green label with a big yellow hop nugget on the front. Foreshadowing is what I think they call that.  The beer itself is a pilsner with some balls. It has a good malt flavor, robust for a pilsner, but nothing too exceptional. The smell is where you'll learn what this beer is winding up to throw at you. Spicy hops abound in smell and taste. The sharpness cuts through the smooth malt and prickles the tounge. Other herbal flavors run through, as if you just took a sickle to a field of flowers and grasses. The hop blend really is unique, and it stays on the tounge long after. I feel this is the point of contention among reviews. Some like that. Some don't. IMHO I like, or at least don't mind, hops sticking on the palette. This is really an exceptional brew, unlike anything I've had. May sound crazy, but I feel my sinuses clearing. It's not insanely hoppy though. I'd be curious if anyone knows the IBU of it. Let me know if you do. Regardless, it is a great big momma of a pilsner and worth a shot.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,UnionMade,4.8,"The beer is a pale, limpid golden yellow, incredibly bright and clear, with tons of cheerful bubbles rising to feed the head. The head is a thick froth of small, even sized bubbles, dying down to a thick mist upon sitting. The head leaves some blobby lace, but dies to a meager ring about halfway through. The head retention is perhaps my only complaint with the brew. The aroma is just fantastic. Very clean pils malt supports a huge peppery saaz spiciness. There's really nothing quite like fresh saaz hops. A touch of cornbread to the malt, with a light lemony fruitiness. The hops are barely balanced, but I'm not complaining. Perhaps some tettnang spiciness, as well. The flavor starts with smooth, angular pils malt, just a touch of graininess and some fresh corn. Frisky, effervescent carbonation adds a sparkle to the lightish medium body, carrying the beer in style. A faint lemony citrus seeps in, with an agressive, clean hopping blasting through the finish. Very spicy, peppery and tangy, with a bit of an herbal, floral german tettnang feel in the long, hoppy finish. The malt does a fine job of supporting the hops, a bit bready, allowing them to roam free but not get into too much trouble. The finish snaps off clean with an effervescent zing, leaving you with little to no aftertaste. Finding a bottle of this that's not expired is nearly impossible around my area. I jumped at the chance to try this on tap, and I was not disappointed.

I wasn't able to pour the entire bottle into my nonick because the head was bigger than the beer content. The aroma is of citrus and that sour grass aroma I associate with lagers. The taste is clean, crisp, dare I say refreshing? But then it gives way to the aftertaste which is mostly that bad tasting (to me) grassy bitter aftertaste that reminds me of lemon rinds. Then again, there are those who like the taste of lemon whites. I've gotten used to it. At least it doesn't taste like water like most other pilsners I've had. A pilsner whith flavor. And an interesting one at that. I do admit this is one of the better pilsners I've had, and am rating it as such. Mouthfeel is crisp (refreshing, I daresay), clean, with a richness of flavor.

345,1010,JimsArcade,4.62,"The beer pours clear to a nice straw color. The almost pure-white head quickly goes from two fingers high to less than one finger in a standard pint glass. The head dissipates to a 1/8 inch coating, but does so longer than I expected: about two-three minutes.  The aroma is invigorating. In the nose it has a mildly-sweet malt aroma with a burst of dry hops. When the mouth gets involved in the process a slight grapefruit characteristic is apparent.  The first taste offers an above-average amount of carbonation. Alcohol and malt tastes are all where I'd expect them to be, but each sip finishes cleaner than expected. That's thanks to the hops kicking in sip after sip. It's very refreshing. As it finishes, I sense characteristics of fresh baby greens and more grapefruit. This may be the perfect summer beer.  This was definitely a surprise. It's quite different from most pilsners I've had. It would be a great way to introduce semi-hop-phobic drinkers to the benefits that hops can offer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Hop-dominated aroma. A little bit of light, dried bread malt is in there, but this is predominantly a mix of herbal, grassy hops and some more floral fragrances. Very light feel to it even though I would hardly describe this as a very light-bodied beer. Unexpectedly smooth from the first sip to the last. Malt sweetness is mild and is wiped aside quickly by a snappy hop bite that offers a really earthy, weedy, plant bitterness. Finishes, of course, pretty dry. Went down in a heartbeat. I was a little surprised, frankly. I was really expecting the hops to be overwhelming, and while they do dominate every aspect of this brew, I think they form much more ""accessible"" type of experience than many super-hopped brews out there. Much more herbal than sharp or outright bitter.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

This has to be one of the better American Pilsners that I have had to date!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,waughbrew,4.59,"Clear pale gold, white head with little retention but some lacing. Smells of sweet pale malt, spicy, flowery German hops. Those leafy hops dominate this brew. Oh what a finish. The beautiful hops slide down gracefully and feel great. Too drinkable. Wow. Malt and hop flavor could mesh a tad better and the head retention should be improved, but damn this is a great beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,merlin48,3.68,"Pours into a German pilsner glass a clear straw yellow with a luscious and ample tightly knit white head. Profuse lacing and excellent head retention. Lemon pepper hits the nose first, followed by a touch of pale malts. Mouthfeel is very carbonated, and there is noticeable hops bite. Plenty of citric bitterness in the taste with minimal malt characteristics. A bit too much of an aggressive hops presence for my preference in a pils. Still a satisfying and very drinkable offering.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,AtLagerHeads,4.15,"A very solid Pils with a very unusual flavor. The body poured out a murky looking light apricot color covered quite completely by a head of creamy, fluffy just-off-white foam that last down the glass and created great lacing.  The nose is solidly hops over a nice malt base; oodles and oodles of spicy hop notes. The flavor is quite rare for a Pilsener style, leaning almost to a Belgian sense from the heavy buttery and spicy flavors. Huge yeastiness is also a major part of this brew; it reminded me of the smell and flavor of water and yeast being prepared for breadmaking. In fact, there is a very strong flavor of sourdough bread imparted from this brew - quite unique.  The feel is full, crisp and quite solid; very nice indeed. Highly drinkable Pils to be sure.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,yankeeheel,4.45,"Pours a beautiful golden yellow with a big, huge billowy white head. Lots of retention and lacing. Smells strongly of yeast and lemony hops. A beautiful sight in my big pilsner glass.  The taste is a little slice of heaven. Clean and smooth with just a small amount of caramel malt. Lots of hops fill in the end but they are very welcome and not overbearing. Mouthfeel is quite casual and drinkability is off the charts. This one slides down like an oyster with tabasco on it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,WesWes,3.58,"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a lacey white head. The aroma is of pale malts and hops. It has a very bitter scent. The taste is decent. It is light and refreshing with quite a bit of hop flavor. Again, the beer has a very bitter taste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. The beer drinks well, but it has a lingering aftertaste that may deter some from having more than one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,rdrummer,3.82,"This probably pales only by comparison to the other tap beers at the brewery. It is a nice clear, golden beer with small white head and almost no lacing. It smelled of hops and other grains. It had a more bitter taste (good thing) than most pilseners. I liked the hoppiness and the bite of it, but I caught a slightly off taste that came after swirling and swallowing. This will not be my choice of beers when I go back.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Foxman,4.1,"It pours a crips clear, golden straw hue. A creamy white head froths, then settles very slowly, showing nice rentention. Lacy rings spiral down the inside of the glass.  There's a presence of floral/fruity hops, along with round notes of malt. I detected a very distant, evasive sourness of yeast as well.  The dry, floral hops kick in first, with a fruit current that is very present as you inhale the sip, almost felt as much as tasted. There's again a round malt sweetness. There's a fleeting ashy taste as the malt gives way and fades to a nice crisp hops tingle.  It's rather light bodied, as expected, and it not so much coats as rinses across the mouth and tongue, leaving a dry, flat hops glow at the back of the mouth.  It's hoppier than most pilsners in my admittedly limited experience, but this is a good thing. It looks refreshing, smells refreshing, and simply, is refreshing, as the flavor delivers on the visual promise. It's damned good, and demands to be drunk, and not just one either, so I did, but it doesn't haunt like so many higher ABV brews. I'm opening my palate back to lagers again, and I almost can't wait till summer to enjoy this on the deck after spending an hour tending to the lawn. Well, the beer I want, but not necessarily mowing the lawn. But you know what I mean.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,beernbbq,4.15,"Beautiful yellow and mildy cloudy appearance with a clean white and tight head. Floral hop aroma mild new mown hay smell.

Overall, a wonderful Pils.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Naerhu,3.03,Opaque gold body with huge fine head spattered with a couple of lava bubbles. Loads of lace.  Light roasted malt and oily lemon aroma. Something smells belgian.  Sweet pale malt at first fading to a dry harsh hoppy flavor. I am surprised at the harshness dispite only medium bitterness. Citrus flavors abound.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,DagFishHead,4.15,"Appearance: Slightly hazy, straw-yellow pour with an abundant fizzy, white head that leaves loads of lace. A persistent whipped-cream dollop floats like a cloud on a sea of gold. Pretty Smell: Sweet and spicy hop oils, lemony, straw/grass earth notes, also a bready/biscuity character. Quite complex... nice. Taste: Slick semi-dry malt grainy/grassiness quickly gives way to spicy, puckery bitter hops at the top concluded by a sudden rush of crisp citrus that leaves the mouth bone dry... ooooh, that was fun. Mouthfeel: Quite full and rich for a lighter style. Carbonation is tight and crisp. Drinkability: A substantial pilsner... am glad I tried it and look forward to enjoying several more some steamy summer day.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BigPapaLager,3.8,"Another fine attempt from Victory. Poured a pale golden hue, with a soft fluffy head that I blew out of the way before first drink. The aroma was hoppy and the taste crisp, Pils are not my favorite in general but thiis my best experience with one to date. Drank all I had, so I say its drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Gasp100,4.25,"I have been trying a lot of IPA's and Pale Ale's lately so I decided on a whim to go with a Lager or Pilsner style this time around. This poured a beautiful clear gold, which I haven't seen in a quite a while (since drinking Foster's over the summer). A medium head about 1/2 inch settled and disapated quickly to a thin lace which stuck to the glass through the entire pint. The smell was full and floral with hoppy overtones. It smelled like what I used to call ""beer"" --- just better. The taste was full and light at the same time. A very crisp, not-to-bitter tingle with a nice balance of malt and hops which mellowed out on the tail end. There was a very slightly sweet taste but definitely not fruity at all. The carbonation added some ""lift"" to the glass and this was extremely drinkable. Victory is just amazing.... Hop Devil (my current fave, Storm King....) I have a newfound love for ""German"" style beers and this one may be perfect for winning over friends who ONLY drink Bud or MGD. I'm really glad to have found a nice ""new"" style to shake things up.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,putnam,3.9,"""Enjoy by 11 Jan. 2004"" It's a well-crafted product. Giant aromas of sticky, fresh herbs are followed by flavors of same. Slatey, intense, loaded with chewy hop stems and seed oils. The liquid is clear and there is a robust head of pillowy white. I search for malt and turn up honeyed, transparent shades of sweetness and silky texture. I would recommend this pils to hop addicts for sure. But for me, there is never a joyful balance of malt and hops. Overbearing in most contexts I can imagine, yet this hop explosion might serve a purpose in certain situations...like on a hay ride or after bong hits.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Gavage,4.35,"This is another fine beer from Victory. Pours a gold / yellow color with a small head. Sports plenty of bubbles as the carbonation level is perfect. The aroma is pleasant with sharp bitterness and some sweetness. The taste and mouthfeel are wonderful - crisp on the tongue, strong hops, and sweetness that all balance out nicely. The bitterness last long (and still going) on the tongue after swallowing. Super refreshing and extremely drinkable. Love this pils.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Dogbrick,3.6,"This is one of the better Pilseners I have tried (along with Schell), and leads me to wonder why so many other ones are so bland and tiresome. The beer is a lightly cloudy pale gold color with medium white head that lingered quite awhile. Lots of small bubbles and thin lacing. The aroma is zesty hops. Light-bodied and crisp with a peppery hops flavor throughout. Some malt is evident as well. The finish is dry and hoppy. The Pils style is nowhere near my favorite but I can see this beer being the standard by which to measure others.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,saltydog,4.25,"Appearance: Golden yellow, crystal clear, resilient head with lace. Smell: aromatic hops with a nice maltbackbone. Flavor: Clean, tasty malt sweetness very nicely balance by hop bitterness. Also very full hop flavors, somewhat earthy. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a nice tangyness from the hops. Very drinkable..an easy session beer. Not my favorite style by any means, but a good example of how good an honest pilsner can be, especially when it doesn't have to travel halfway across the world.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BierManVA,2.75,Extremely hoppy smell. The head disappeared quickly (although well carbonated.). Color is very light golden. I am getting no malty flavors or aroma's whatsover.  I enjoy most pilsners but find the extreme hoppiness of this bier to be a distraction. The aftertaste and mouthfeel are absolutely attrocious in my opinion.  This is not a bier I enjoy but I can see why it is popular with the crowd. It is original in it's approach and not a tasteless macro crap.  Just not for me.  John,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,kmo1030,3.78,"hazy yellow color kind of weird actually, with a thick fluffy white head. thick lace all the way down. strangely sweet smelling, but also very hoppy. you know this is gonna be pretty intense before you even taste it. it takes a few sips to get used to the hops, and be able pick out anything else. first the hops here are incredibly strong, i don't think i've had a beer in which the hops seem to be so pure and untainted by other flavors. i feel like just got a mouthful of raw hops, but in a good way. underneath there is a subtle malt profile, without which this beer would be pretty vile hop water. it has a slight vanilla slight licorice flavor from he interplay between the malt and hops and slightly fruity flavor. With out the heavy carbonation that it has, i think this would be gross so i like the somewhat thin and higly carbonated mouthfeel. this beer walks a fine line, so drinkablity takes a little hit. i couldn't drink more than a couple of this in a sitting.  note: freshness date is sept 28 '03, so this might be a little past it's prime.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Stopper,4.2,"This pours a slightly hazy light golden yellow. The head is creamy, fluffy, and very white. The aroma is of a spicy hoppiness over a sturdy light malt base. The body is medium and quite effervescent, and the initial taste is balanced toward the bitter side. The bright hop bitterness becomes even bigger very quickly and has a nice combination of spice, fruit, and grass notes. This is more pronounced into the finish, but a decent base malt sweetness supports it for a bit before it nearly completely dries out and the bitterness and huge flavor of hop spiciness with a bit of grassiness again. This flavor sticks around for quite a while, and if I wait for a while before the next sip I'm left with a very sharp bitter spiciness on the back of my tongue, and the round flavor of a noble-type hop finish toward the sides and front.  Well, to put this pilsner against most of the other pilsners I've ever tried is almost unfair. This has a gigantic hoppiness, the like of which I think I've never even come close to finding in another pilsner. And I don't want to say it's a great beer just because it has a lot of hops, but I do want to say it's a great beer because it has a lot of interest throughout, with a respectable malt base supporting a wonderfully captivating blend of hop flavors that lasts from the nose to the finish, all while still having the very dry spicy finish I'd expect from a pils... only with a nice addition of extra dimension.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Brent,4.4,"This is a pilsener? Wow - a whole new world of what a pils can be has opened before my eyes. Massive carbonation - took three pours to let the head settle and get the beer in the glass. Candy sweet aroma, but the beer was not sweet in flavor. Hops - this beer is an example of how a pils can be hoppy, and done darn well, at that. As a hop-head, I have great appreciation for a lager that can carry a substantial hop load without an ale's malt to shoulder the burden. Very crisp and clean, and, surprisingly, very little hop bitterness at the finish. If I had regular access to this beer, it would be a staple in the garage fridge.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Ianhockey91,4.43,"Great pilsner, enough said. Probably the best lager i have had in a long time. Looks a pale straw yellow, with a head that leaves an incredible amount of lace on the glasss, bordering on artwork. The nose is slightly hoppy, and quiter herbal. The taste is as smooth as it can get, they should call this stuff perfect pils instead. I will have this in the house all the time. The perfect baseball beer in my opinion.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,RoyalT,4.46,"Appearance - Very light in color with a beautiful foamy head that left a gorgeous lacing on my glass.  Smell - Light, grassy hop aroma with a balancing sweetness. It looks and smells like a pils, but how does it taste?  Taste - I've found it very frustrating that American brewers can't seem to mimick the exceptional smoothness and traditional flavors of a German Pils. This one hits the nail on the head.  The malt flavors are in the background, of course. The grassy and floral hops caress the tongue gently but distinctly. There's some sweetness to be had, but it's the signature hop flavor that leads this one to the Promise Land.  Mouthfeel - Masterfully light and smooth. Be careful of your first sip - you might empty the glass with it.  Drinkability - I used to love drinking a pils outside in the middle of the day, walking around cobblestone Bavarian streets in search of the tastiest bratwurst stand. This one takes me back. Another winner from Victory!  Update - I first rated this with a 2003 vintage to thought it would be fun to re-review it with an '04. This really is an amazing Pils. It's on the big side, mind you, but has to be one of the best session beers sold in the US. I'm upping my Drinkability rating by half a point and praying to the empty bottle.  Update - I took a studious look at this beer again in 2009. Six years now I've been drinking this Pils and it hasn't lost it's luster. I reviewed three bad beers in a row tonight, dumping most of them in the sink, so need something reliable.  The Prima Pils is just a beautiful beer. The head especially comes up just right and is one of the prettiest beer toppings I've ever seen in my life. The rest of the beer is top-notch as previously reviewed, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better American-made effort at the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,farHillsBrewer,4.6,"Another classic from Victory. It has the perfect Pilsner profile: looks clean and refreshing, an immediate balanced sweetness, followed by a satisfying mouthfeel, and gradually finishing with that hoppy bitterness that lasts. Nice lace on the glass. A perfect summer beer that you can ""repeat as necessary"". A definite ""Buy it by the Case"". Don't share this beer with drinkers of ""lite"" or budmillercoors, they just don't get it, so don't give them any.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,beerinator,3.28,"Appearance: Golden, super clear. White head with slight head retention.  Aroma: Piney hop aroma over powers. Sharp hops! Slight bit of citrus behind the pine trees.  Taste: Smoother than expected from the aroma. The beer is bitter upfront, but fades to merely a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. The hop presence on the tongue feels strangely muted compared to the last time I tried this. I think this beer may have been a bit old.  Notes: This particular sample seems to have diminished in its hoppy flavor. It's a good beer, but lacking the bold flavor I recall from my last tasting of it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Gueuzedude,4.28,"A nice bright golden color, that pours with a nice white head that disappears quickly. Has a nice appealing floral bouquet. The first taste is one of a soft malty flavor, which then finishes with a nice sharp hop bitterness that marries well with a bit of hop flavor.

345,1010,ManekiNeko,4.25,"12 oz bottle with a freshness date of Jan 11, 2004. Served chilled in a pint glass.  Appearance: Crystal clear light golden yellow in color. Topped with a lovely and lively white head of tiny bubbles. The head goes away after a minute or so, leaving you with a small layer of bubbles on the top. Active carbonation in the glass during the entire consumption. Adequate lacing, to boot.  Smell: It might look like a macro, but it sure as #### don't smell like one. Grapefruity citrus hops (with hints of orange) balanced with sprucy hop aroma greet you. Nice hoppy bouquet... very appealing.  Taste: Inital salty flavor that gives way to a piney bitterness. Nice light malt flavor pokes it's head out shortly thereafter. Aggressively hopped for a pilsener, but it works.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with a pleasant aftertaste.  Drinkability: Quite quaffable, though I've certainly enjoyed the other Victory beers I've had much more. Definitely a beer for the porch/stoop on a hot summer day. Could easily be a great session beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

When I was frist introduced to this one a couple years ago I was not prepared to be won over, but won over I was!! It pours a beautiful clear yellow color with a nice creamy head. The wonderfully fragrant hops are present immediately. There is a certain sweetness to this beer. It is WAY hoppier than most Pils, but heck, it is from Victory, and they know how to use their hops!!

A thanks to my friend Dan and his daily stops at Premier. Poured a crystal clear yellow with a big marshmallowy white head. Smell is of peppery, spicy, hops with a slight, lean malt aroma. Taste: WOW! Lightly sweet malts up front that are quickly replaced with a building hop spiciness, punctuated with a sharp, bitter finish. Ahhh! Very crisp and a big feel for a pilsner.

Very simple and round, full of german earthy hops. The beer ended with a long lingering bitterness.  This is one unique pilsner.

Has that classic pilsner smell, I need to find out what that is exactly, and bumps it up to a snappier version. A faint hint of citrus, but overall a faint nose without much to it.  Taste - without hesitation, the most unique pilsner I've had to date. I didn't pick up much hop aroma, but it sure is there in the flavor! Refreshing carbonation, the pilsner malt quickly gives way to a bitter hop bite. Not a lot of depth to the hops, but a solid grapefruit sourness on the finish. A lingering aftertaste of citric bitterness, but no development beyond the grapefruit taste.  Mouthfeel is very crisp via good carbonation. What would be an average body is enhanced by the hop level. And what would typically finish cleaner for a pils stays around longer via the oiliness of the hops  Drinkability - A little more bang than I would normally expect in a pils, this is an intense beer. The freshness date said to enjoy by Jan 24, '03, so technically this is 6 months past peak. A fresh sample may improve scores, time will tell. For as much as I am impressed by the flavor uniqueness, that same character also limits its drinkability as you don't expect quite so much aggressiveness in a pilsner style. Maybe this should be classified an India Pales-ner Ale? :-)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Appearance: A resilient straw-golden appearance with a massive white puffy head that sits well. Laces the glass well, rings and smudges of thick lace cling to the glass edges. Average carbonation aids head retention.  Nose: Crisp malts mixed with light citric hops. Some spices and a biting pungent bitterness at the back.  Taste: A tasty mix of biscuit from the pilsner malts and a strong spicy bitterness that comes from the hops. The bitterness builds as the beer drinks through, citric elements and a very strong fresh green-hop bitterness in the finish that seems to bite and linger for ever.  Mouthfeel: Extremely crisp, biting bitterness in the mouth that builds to a crescendo even after you swallow the beer. Fulfilling, yet it still has an average mouthfeel overall.  Drinkability: Easily imbibed on a warm, slightly sticky night in Long Beach. An excellent thirst quencher, which really hits the mark. I will most certainly have another one of these please, thank you very much!

Flow and appearance are just what you would expect for this pilsener, but SHAZAM! What's that smell? Deep, earthy, almost barnyard-like, and full of nasal-fuming spice. Can these be the magical Saaz hops of yore? What a welcome addition--and masterful micro-stroke--to the tired, lame, rehashed, and retarded world of the ""Pilsener.""

345,1010,sinistersteve,4.17,Exploding head was very enjoyable and easily viewable to watch through its medium golden color . Seems to have an aroma and flavor that is what a pilsner beer sould be. The quality of ingrediants and craftsmanship is easily noticable with this one. Just one outstanding beer.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,xgrigorix,3.93,"Medium gold, clear, with a puffy white cloud floating on top. Steady carbonation rises from the depths. Head eventually settles in leaving a stream of lace in it's wake. A quick swill brings the head right back. And I smell hops! Just a touch of sweetness up front, quickly gives way to an over the top hop laden finish. Dry, with hints of lemon grass. Spicy, floral, and bitter all at the same time. Just enough of the malt sticks around to keep it from crashing in on itself. Very clean flavor, crisp, and quite refreshing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,tar,4.17,"Poured a cloudy pale golden/straw yellow color, with a nice sized foamy white head capping the beer. A mild but very pleasant aroma is present, consisting of hops and a bit of spiciness (the slight scent of apples may also be present). Nice taste of hops, spice, and a bit of fruitiness. Feels very smooth and light in the mouth. This beer has a very nice crispness to its finish, and is probably very enjoyable on a hot summer day.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,longpondbeerman,4.22,"A very nice pilsener. Even as I poured, I could smell the hops drifting up from the slightly clouded golden yellow brew which cascaded nicely and rose to a thick creamy off-white foam. Nor did the taste disappoint: lots of hops balanced with a light, but noticeably sweet maltiness and a touch of rose hips. Good staying power too--this taste. Highly recommended for a warm late spring evening refresher, especially when you plan to have a couple.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,SheepNutz,4.06,"I had this pils in a 12oz. bottle poured into a tall pilsener glass. It pours a slightly hazy golden color with the largest head I've ever seen. No matter how slowly you pour this one, the foam is unstoppable. It took me about 10 minutes to pour it. Seriously, this is harder to pour than a Duvel. There is lots and lots of thick lacing left on the glass. The smell is hoppy and grassy, reminds me of springtime lawn mowing. The taste has the same grassy effect, with a little clove or ginger spice. There is a little bit of hops on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is just a tad bit oily. The drinkability is awesome, and I could drink many more of these.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Hobbz,4.33,"Wow, impressive head: thickly sticky, prevalent and lingering all the way through. My first bottle I poured recklessly into my glass at my own peril (well, actually handed this one off to my bud who was none the wiser!). My pour took me longer and I let the beer sit a minute or two. When I took hold of my glass once again, the beer looked fantastic  as if it were poured over on the continent (where a genuine pils pour takes longer than a Guinness), with no-quit effervescence. Aroma also matched its profile  sweet pils character, slight grassy but hoppy nose. Taste was great to boot: hop bitterness to match its thin-pils character/mouthfeel. Not a really dry lager, but complex. Prima! Think right now its the best home-grown pils Ive had yet.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jcalabre,3.81,"Originally sampled on 19 January 2002. I'm not a big fan of pilseners; HOWEVER, Victory's Prima Pils is well worth seeking out. I even went to a pilsener tasting a couple of months ago and Prima Pils put the rest to shame. It has a clear straw color w/ a nice hoppy taste on the palate. It's very nice to drink",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,nomad,4.75,"Pours a bright straw gold, with a big frothy head that as it falls turns into a picture of a mountain in decay. Carbonation tends to a steady continuum of different sized bubbles. Has lace and some stain, occasionally in the form of dry clumpy bits that look like firm mineral deposits. Ask for the ""slow pour"" if you get it at the brewery's pub.  Smell is a world of hop and malt scents: strong farm and garden scents like a bier de garde, of hay, grass, clove, cumin, dried thin flowers. Malty scents of sourdough, pear, apple, pale malt grain. An endless array of scents turning over.  Taste begins very dry and hoppy, but with a golden bread crust malt body underneath. Moves into a fine pale malt sweetish-ness with toned floral hops on top. Has a super soft but relentlessly drying bitterness climbing over my tongue, sometimes developing sourdough bread notes. Juicy, soft, dry, and a fine malt base, topped off by a thin and easy mouthfeel which is carbonated for body, and not for showing off bubbles.  With a developed palate, you can tell this is a classic pils. A classic.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,bmills1608,4.14,"Golden crystal clear color. Huge fluffy snow white head. Served in a chunky pint glass on draught.  Nicely crisp and spicy hop aroma leaps from the glass. There is no denying right from the start that what you have here is a ""hop first"" beer. Taste is bold and spicy, hard as a rock and a joy from start to finish. The crispness of the hops cuts through like a knife. Bitter? - yes, but not in a bad way. A truly enjoyable bitterness shines through and is never totally overpowering due to a warm bread-like core of soft malt. A BIG pils.

Complex beer taste wise but all light delicate flavors on the tongue. Almost hypnoticly drinkable. Smooth light mouth. Malty crisp (Hop) flavor. There is a sharp bitterish hop dagger left on the tongue in the finish. A great beer with food (esp italian, mexican etc). This is a master representation of a pils.

345,1010,aracauna,3.78,"Nice golden hue. A bit cloudy. Fluffy head could form more easily, nice staying power. Aroma is pleasantly grainy, lemon. Hops add floral, slighty spicy smell. The flavor is more of the clean crisp dry malt. Hops come through on short dry, bitter finish. While Tupper's Hop Pocket Pils suffers from an overattention to the hops, this is nicely balanced and very pleasing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Darkale,4.35,"My, what a lovely beer.  I have to confess that I have avoided pilseners because there are so many crappy American big-brewery beers that purport to be pilseners. But, I have wondered recently if I am focusing too much on the big beers, and since I love Victory beers, I thought I would give this a try.  Wow. Very nice. This is what the American macro-breweries would make if they only could.  Pours pale yellow, slightly cloudy, with a thick, foamy, and bright white head that lasts nicely (and is pocked with sediment). Lacing is strong, looping all over the inside of the glass.  Aroma is fresh, slightly fruity, slightly hoppy.  Brisk tasting, slightly bitter but mellow overall, just a bit chewy. This is a remarkable beer. How nice to find out about it just as May is ready to appear in hot Virginia. A great hot weather beer, full of character, but not overwhelming. Wonderful.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Truly a thing of beauty. Nose is floral hops, bitter hop oils, and fresh cut grass. Medium in body with a strong amount of fine carbonation. Taste starts off with sweet malts followed by some fresh grassy flavors and bitter hop oils and resins that leave a very crisp and refreshing finish.

It pours a slightly hazy golden color with a huge rocky head that seems to never die down. It leaves a thick, sticky lace all over the glass. There is high amount carbonation that seems force the aromas right up your nose. Aromas are filled with sweet hoppy goodness, spices, and citrus peel. The taste packs a big punch of citrus-like hops.

345,1010,tavernjef,3.6,"This was a little more then average pilsner due to its bigger bite and flavor. Color was a cloudy yellow, no head, just some light fizzy bubbles on the top. Smell was a bit bitter from a fresh hop and some sweet maltyness. You could tell it was gonna have some bite just from the smell. Which it had, some favorable hop bite and bitterness, not bad, could've been smoother for a pilsner. I liked it more as it went along. Its a pretty decent pilsner and quite drinkable. The bite is right, but a little much for a pilsner in my book.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,avylover,4,"This is one pilsner that is enjoyable to drink. It has a nice fruit hoppiness to it that goes nice over the usual barley flavor for this style.

This beer adds taste, the missing link in a pilsner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,AudioGilz,3.43,"Slightly cloudy...I thought pilseners should be clear? Aroma is very much of spicy hops and a little bit of malt sweetness. The flavor is very very hoppy...a spicy kind of hoppy. It's odd, because I bought this sixer a few weeks ago, and my first try of it was absolutely horrible. Just straight up completely and utterly stomach turning bitter. So I was pissed that I bought a bad batch and let the rest sit in the crisper. And I try one tonite, and it tastes tolerable. It's not great, still very bitter, but now it tastes like I thought it should. Who knows, my palate might have been retarded the last time. I find this beer pretty enjoyable now. A little too much bitterness for my liking though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,GreatPondBrewer,4.29,"Poured a straw yellow, cloudy with virtually no head. This was a pretty average pour, but lurking inside was a huge brew. It smelled very bitter with lots of citrus in the nose. The taste was bold, hoppy and bitter with a slight malt taste. There were some nice mellow notes of pear and mellon that came to the front as it warmed. This is another great brewe from Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,WVbeergeek,4.25,"Victory is amazing, because they don't give in to the masses, and they brew the types of beers that they like to brew. This one pours a slightly hazy gold with a vibrant white head that left a full even lace all the way down the glass. The aroma presents a very quaffable bouquet of aromatic saaz hops, not much sweetness just all hops baby. Victory pulled an Emeril on this one, and kicked it up another notch. The European hops give it that classic lager crispness. The taste has a more balanced malt/hop ratio than the aroma. Slightly citrus edge to it, the bitterness leaves a trail of hop resin as it flows down the gullet. The mouthfeel is standard for a well done pilsner, very unique overall finish from this light to medium bodied beer. I could drink this regularly, very palatable and easy to drink. I can't see how somebody couldn't love this beer, but that's just my opinion.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,yen157,4.4,"Golden straw in color with a fine white head that melted away leaving a very sticky lace on the glass and on the liquid. Beautiful, and dare I say it, nearly perfect pale malt and hop aroma. Yum. Malty, spicy, tea-like sweet fruit what is there NOT to like about this beer. Soft bubbles, but not under carbonated. This was a pilsner like Ive never had before.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Jarod,4.57,"This beer was poured, drank and loved at the brewery itself. It came to me a bright beautiful golden yellow color. Very clear so that one could watch the bubbles dance in the glass. A soft, creamy white head sat on top of my glass calling me to nose and taste it. So I did. The aromas that tickled my nose were fresh, sweet, spicy and hoppy. The different hop smells from fresh grass to citrus to flowers to spices came right at my nose. There were some sweet malt tones as well but the hops were the primary smells. And the taste, WOW, the taste was absolutely great. Hops took the front again, grass, lemons, cloves, hay, flowers and some spices all covered my tongue, again, there was a definite sweet malt presence as well to try to balance the hops, and does so very well. But one cannot deny that this beer was made for hops. Very bold and aggressive from the moment it touches your lips to the middle as it rushes over your tongue to the very dry finish. When I say dry, I mean dry. I swear I could actually feel every drop of moisture get sucked off of my tongue. It was like a desert in there, a bold flavorful desert that I would not mind being stranded in. Great example of this style. Loved it and was glad rotsaruch told me to try it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,OatmattStout,3.88,It was a nice golden color and had a really nice whit pillowy head that stayed for a while and rendered a really impressive lace all the way down the glass. It's flavors were hop dominated and very refreshing. Exactly what I expected as the american micro version of a pilsner. It had very good body and a grapefruit tart hop finish. More hoppy than most pils you will come across but good none the less.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,WanderingFool,3.88,"One of the tastiest pilsners I've tried. The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a thick white frothy foam head. The foam will flow over the glass if not poured slowly! A citrusy/hoppy aroma floats above the beer. Each sip is very smooth, but there is a slight tingle on the tonge just before you swallow. Flavors of hops & citrus seem to dominate at first, however a toasted malt taste makes its presence known towards the end. A dry finish with a slightly hoppy aftertaste is all that remain after each sip.  This beer reminds me of some of the European pilsners I've tried, but without the skunky aroma or taste. Another winner from Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,cretemixer,4.1,"My first Victory product! Pours a slightly hazy gold with a unbelievable thick and dense head that hangs in there for a good, long time. Fades to about a quarter inch fed by the carbonation. Floral and citrus hop aroma is foremost. Taste is also very hoppy for a pilsener, but extremely welcome. Good mouthfeel for the style and nicely carbonated--Left a mother of a lace down the whole glass too.

The hop aroma is very nice and strong, the malt aroma has some earthy notes to it quite pleasant indeed. The first sips brings great enjoyment to my palate the strong, yet very nice hop flavor is there in full force. The maltiness is very good also because it compliments the hops.

Lemony aroma, some Saaz characteristics with a far off malt sense of shortbread. Wow, nicely hoppy flavor, clover, flowers, and a citrusy sense. Malt takes a back seat and is somewhat biscuit-like overall. A very nice dry finish.

I've yet to be disappointed by any of their beers.  Pours a lovely, golden yellow with a ""shimmering"" head that was very robust and persisted to coat the glass all the way to the very bottom.  Aroma is HOPPY! A floral, spciy nasal assault that clearly indicates the direction this beer is going.  Flavor? Hoppy, obviously. Very crisp and dry, this beer was made for tantalizing the taste buds. Hiding in the background is the malt character, but it was masked by the hops to the point that I really couldn't discern what I was tasting. Mouthfeel is excellent, as is the drinkability. It finished clean and dry, with the hoppy character lingernig.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Brewzzle,4.35,"For someone who's introduction to beer was bad pilseners this has changed my whole opinion of the style.  Appearance is the usual pilsener yellow but with a warm golden hint, a giveaway that this beer is something special. A fine head which leaves a delicate lace all the way to bottom of the glass.  To taste it is hoppy (I figured the large hop flower on the bottle might mean something), clean and very crisp. There is a slight yeast taste noticeable in the first sip but the big flavor quickly overcomes. A moderate malt sweetness and body to match. Aftertaste is a deliciously strong hop bitterness which lasts and lasts. Perhaps the hops are a little out of balance but that is fine with me.  If the Big Business Beers have ruined your impression of what is touted as one of the great beer styles then this beer will make everything alright again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BeerAngel,4.39,"Pours a very clear and very pale yellow with numerous bubbles racing to the top to reach the pure white 2 finger head that awaits them. The aromas of floral hops and a light earthy scent make the taste buds antsy. Wow! First off, you taste the floral hops again along with nice lightly sweet mild earthy malt. A very crisp and clean light bodied brew that finishes with a dry hop. This creates a higher drinkability in this brew due to the dryness making you want more as well as a very nice flavor. Nicely done! Thanks again to Rotsaruch for sending this brew! Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Scoats,4.18,"I'm not a fan of Czech style pilsners. Yeah I know it's ""the best beer in the world!"" and everything but the true to style finishing taste just doesn't do it for me.  That being said, I really, really like this beer. Prima Pils is a very traditional pilsner in every way (yellow filtered body, big white head, and dry, dry, dry) until it gets to the very final taste where it gets ""wet"" and flowerly, if that makes sense.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,HopDevil,4.55,"Victory Prima Pils is the very definition of crisp and dry, and, if you look in the dictionary under refreshing, don't be surprised if they show a bottle of this beer as an example.  The cloud of hop aroma that wafts into the nostrils upon opening a bottle of Prima Pils announces that this is definitely not your customary Pils and accurately predicts the flavor that follows. While some yeast nose is evident, the clean fresh herbal hop aroma overwhelms the malt but what a heavenly odor to a hophead like myself.  A mountain of firm antique white lather piled up on the pale gold colored beer as I carefully poured the Prima into my pilsner glass. The lovely head was long lasting and left a patchy, frothy lace on the glass as it stubbornly receded. Prima in the glass is brilliant and clear of any chill haze. Effervescent bubbles were seen visibly drifting slowly up into the foamy cloud above.  The taste was predominately hops - herbal with a hint of grassiness. Prima rewards you with a satisfying hop flavor without succumbing to bitterness. Yes, Definitely noble hops and totally mouthwatering! Further along the taste buds I detected a very slight astringent or husky graininess with only a ghost of residual malt sweetness (my sweet receptor taste buds may have long since been burned away however) with no fruity esters, diacetyl or citrus notes in evidence. The after taste is hop heaven, dry and very enjoyable. This is a beer that is an excellent compliment to most meals but may tend to dominate delicate flavored dishes.  Prima Pils is a beer I savored and enjoyed very much and I predict that in future I will often have a glass of it's hopy fragrance and golden color in my hand. Like they say "" A victory for your taste"" if you have a taste for hops that is.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Also as much as I rant and rave about the Poor Lagers/Pils, must admit this is a beer to admire.  The archetypal pilsner color, a crystalline gold color, the head dazzling white, modest in size, creamy in its texture, the left over lace a delicate glass covering sheet. Lemon Lime fresh and crisp is the nose, dominated by the malts, quite a pleasure to sniff.

Lots of little carbonation bubbles constantly fight their way to the top.  Smell: Aroma of fresh Saaz hops. I've heard their smell described as 'sea air.' Sounds about right... Very light grassy, earthy aroma as well. Great nose on this brew!  Taste: Starts off with a strong bitter, hoppy note that never goes away. Faint taste of a grassy, earthy character, with a bit of floral spiciness. I'm not usually a Pilsner kinda' guy, but this beer is fantastic!  Mouthfeel: Light, dry, and crisp.

345,1010,mzwolinski,4.7,"Crystal clear, light gold in color, with heavy carbonation and a thin, foamy head. Husky malt aroma with floral hoppy notes. The hops really come through in the taste, though. This is the first beer I've had where I've really understood the ""fresh grass"" description of hop aroma. The Saaz hops used here have a very huge herbal, flowery taste to them. The German pilsner malt is also quite heavy, making this beer fairly full-bodied and chewy, especially for the style. Finishes dry, and leaves you with an aftertaste where the hops finally start to show their bitter/spicy side -- a very nice compliment to the lingering sweetness of the malt. A very aggressive and pleasant interpretation of a distinctively *European* Pilsner. It would be very easy to drink a lot of these in a row.

The smell was rich in flowery, herbal hops, with some sweet breadlike malt in the background. Medium bodied with a good bit of tingly carbonation, typical Pilsener sweetness at first, then the hops take over with a vengeance. Hop character is very herbal/flowery before a drying bitterness on the finish. Not much in the way of malt flavor, just enough to know it's in there, the hops are king in this brew. Overall quite a drinkable beer, tastes like a European pils, with an American IPA hoppiness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

Despite my attempts at a nice pour, half of the bottle shot from the glass and ended up in my lap. My second attempt at pouring was much more successful. It yielded a cloudy, hazy appearance with a light golden color. An excellent head formed (1/2-inch or so), with very nice retention. A luxuriant hop aroma was apparent, as well as a faint maltiness. The pronounced hop bitterness attacked my tongue first, followed by a nice malt foundation. I was really pleased by the taste and excellent overall pilsener characteristics. The Pils has a very full and somewhat creamy mouthfeel, and the fizziness seemed to magnify in my mouth. This filling carbonation made me want to wait a little while longer between beers, but the Pils remains a very drinkable, enjoyable lager.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,maxpower,4.5,"This is my kind of pills, golden color , nice foamy white head, leaves a lace in my glass, hoppy aroma for a pils, balanced flavors in this nectar , it has a very tasty hop bite and finishes dry.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,AaronRed,4.3,"I poured this into a nice pilsner glass and it looked great. Straw yellow and clear with a nice rocky white heat on top. It has a very clean smell- a little hoppy. But this beer is all about the taste. Crisp and flavorful, I kept thinking I was drinking a German or Czech. beer. Wonderful bitterness at first, but mellows nicely. Overall a supreme drinking beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Suds,4.55,"Wow. I guess that I didn't have high expectations, but this is an extraordinarily good beer. Golden-straw colored with a puffy white head...the aroma is slightly herbal and resinous. The taste is incredible. I think it's the hoppiness that did it for me....a big hop bitterness and a dry finish seem to come out of nowhere. This isn't my style, but the beer is fantastic.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,rotsaruch,4.4,"An almost clear golden color with a white, creamy head that holds up fairly well. The hops aroma is very noticable, but not overwhelming with a faint spicy character. It has distinctive refreshing and crisp taste. The hop flavor is plentiful and pleasing with a malty presense in the background. The finish is big and hoppy, satisfying beyond belief on the hottest summer day. An impressive German-style pilsner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Jason,4.12,"Bight pale yellowish golden colour with a very active carbonation that hold the near perfect lace together.  Very expressive in the hop department with herbal and spicy aromas and flavours that solidly dominate the senses but not to the point of being overwhelming. Touch of biscuity doughy maltiness within, very clean with a dry long lasting hoppy finish.  Perfect with some spicy homemade sausage at Redbones. If you like your pils with more than enough hops this is the one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Todd,4.07,"Had this on-tap @ Redbones. Presented as a crystal clear, pale golden beer with a wicked tight white cream head with plenty of lace stick.  Aroma was a hop attack on the nose ... quite spicy, herbal and perfume-like.  Hops! All hops. A dry beer with an amazing hop character that's spicy, prickly to the palate with loads of earthy herbal characters. Malts are bready and subdued by the strong hop presence. Thin tropical fruitiness and a sweet tea-like backbone. Dry grain finish.  More hops than your average pils, but that was the point and the wonderful thing about the art of brewing ... you don't always have to follow style to make a good beer. Personally, I loved the defining over-the-top hop character. Without it ... it might just be any old pils.  Paired nicely with homemade sausages, catfish fingers and greens.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,aaronh,4.45,"Very strong hops aroma with a hint of pine as I was pouring the beer. Very interesting. This is a pal golden beer that pours with a very nice head that lasts well and leaves a nice lace. The aroma is spicy hops, with a hint of something that I can only call a pine-like smell for lack of better terminology. The mouthfeel is very full bodied and silky. It has a nice hops kick in the aftertaste, but the malt is very present in the mouth. This may be my favorite lager(Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold is close). A little aggressive on the hops for the style perhaps, but it works very well. Might not a good ""crossover' beer for macro friends, but a fine beer indeed. After a few drinks, this one started to disappear quickly. And I like to savor my beers! Glad I have six of them. I've yet to be disappointed in Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,allboutbierge,4.32,"A friend who works at West Virginia Brewery recommended that I really check out everything Victory has to offer about six months ago when i started getting into beer, real beer that is. I finally bought some Prima Pils and am glad I waited so long to get it; it allowed me to learn some properties to look for in a beer. The color is a very slightly cloudish light light golden yellow and the lace it leaves on my pint glass is heavy. Head was light to non exsistant and first impression of taste of pretty bitter but bitter in the way a grapefruit is-having some sweetness properties deep down in its flavor. There is a hopiness taste also to it, but of far less stregnth than the bitterness or the hidden sweetness. The carbonation is light/medium and the lack of weight of a pilsner leaves a good mouthfeel. Only detraction from this beer is that it's too bitter to drink a bunch of, but in respect to one of the nations foremost microbrewers you probably shouldnt do that anyways. (not to mention your wallet)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,boblinneman,5,"A hopheads pils. This beer will hook you and not let go. Very suprising how dry and hoppy. Definitely will change the way you look at a pils. I'm not sure if this beer is true to its form (everything is but quite hoppy), but who cares its great. Victory has an ongoing series of single hop pils, all great but different.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Riggo,4.72,"Hazy golden yellow color with a white, luscious, creamy head. Good head retention. The bouquet bursts forth with floral hops bringing to mind fresh mown grass, mint, pine, lemon, yeast. A powerful and exciting nose. The taste is very dry and hoppy with lemony, grassy, and spicy notes and, no kidding, bubblegum. Great, soft mouthfeel; an unusually substantial body for a pils. This, along with the very heavy hops, makes this pils drink more like an ale of sorts.  This is definitely not a beer for the uninitiated. The dryness of the hops is very intense but blends beautifully with the whole refreshing, grassy, floral thing rather than just coming off as an astringent afternote. I love this beer and I think it is one of the supreme brewing accomplishments in this country.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,BeerManDan,3.65,"The color was a pale yellow with very little foam and a medium amount of lace of the side of the glass. The smell or malts and hops have a pleasant aroma. The taste of malts and hops were a sort on the bitter side. Flavor wise, it was lacking the flavor I was expecting from a Victory Ale. Just a tad to bitter for my taste!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,IrishRedRock,3.61,"I was told not to try this beer, as two of my fellow beer lovers hated it. So for this reason alone I had to try it. The smell upon cracking open the bottle was quite harsh...overpowering actually. I thought the taste would be similar but the bitterness I expected was not there. Extremely hoppy with a spicy bite both initially and in the aftertaste, but this is quite tasty. Very different from any other Pils I have tasted, and well worth it for its unique qualities.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,jackndan,3.86,"Prima Pils: from Victory, strong aroma of hops assaults the nose as soon as it hits the glass. Huge head, in fact I think we might have a winner in the on-going quest from height above the rim: two full inches! The beer itself is extremely hoppy, with pine flavors after the initial bite. Light in body, with a nice refreshing clean finish. Very nice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,NeroFiddled,4.42,"Slightly hazy, bright golden color with a soft, creamy head that holds up fairly well. The aroma is intensely hoppy - bright and fresh - with a grassy and somewhat spicy character. A crisp carbonation and medium body join to create a full mouthfeel. The flavor is bold. It's generously malty, but then it needs to be to support the mouth-watering and solid hop flavor. Quite aggressive. The finish is big and hoppy, leaving a resiny dryness. A bold German-style pilsner, not so much seductive as it is dominating.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Jon,4.57,"This one pours a golden color with a solid head and some really nice lace. The smell is somewhat grassy. This tastes great. Big hop flavor for the style, which as a hop head, I love. Prima Pils is certainly an easy drinking beer, but probably not for the faint of heart. It's easily the best pilsner I've ever sampled and is another winner from Victory. As one who generally doesn't enjoy this style, I'm impressed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Wildman,4.01,"Okay, this beer poured a dark yellow color and formed a white bubbley head that left some nice lace. The aroma, well, let's just say the hops exploded in my olfactory area. There was also some grassy, earthy elements. The flavor, once again, was most definately hops. Also present was malt and citrus. The finish was fairly dry. One of the best pils I have had, but I admit to not being a big fan of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Thrasher,3.84,"Pleasing pale yellow with sticky head, wonderful hoppy scent. The malts are so mild, they are hardly even there. Just a faint wisp at the bottom of the flavor. Hops are the crux of this beer; incredibly floral with hints of grass, ending with a resoundingly bitter finish. Hopheads should be in paradise, and this is indeed a tasty, appetizing beer... but to my tastes it's a bit too much with the hops, ends up being very American (in the distinctive Cascade/Sierra piney hop way), and the bitterness just borders on the abrasive. Not quite balanced. I would kick up the malt a notch and make the hops less floral and more towards grass/dried hay. The water is a bit hard too, I wonder if they could make it a little creamier. For a truly exceptional American pilsner, my vote's with Brooklyn.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,pheurton,4.43,"Pours a brilliant gold-straw with a foamy white head that really stuck to the glass. Very aromatic, you can smell the floral hops in the nose. The balance between the malt and the hops is incredible...the finish is bitter but not in an IPA sort of way. A great summertime beer and truly outstanding example of the style",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,marc77,3.99,"The thick ivory - white head tops a hazy straw - hued brew. Smooth bready grain aroma w/ a slightly spicy Saaz hop nose. Assertive bitterness upfront followed by mellow toasty malt sweetness. Spicy & lightly grassy Saaz hop flavor. Finishes w/ bready notes ending abruptly and a lingering, clean hop bitterness. Prima Pils is a tasty pilsner that is refreshingly bitter... probably the most bitter Pilsner I've tasted.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,RonfromJersey,4.47,"Yellow gold body. Frothy, but disipating head, very good lacing. Subtle carbonation. Hay/grass nose, floral nor citric. Taste has hops way out front, but with enough malt to hold it together. Still some proper balance despite hop lead. Malt presence is more subtle, more noticeable with each sip. Probably my favorite pils. Unlike many pils, wouldn't give this to a beer novice (I'd use their All Malt Lager instead). Another gem from Bill and Ron.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Bierman9,3.97,"A good-looking light golden color was offset by a very small head, and minimal lacing. Nose kicked you with some real sharp hop spiciness. Whoa! Surprized, too, by it's relatively medium body and smoothness on the tongue. Many pils I've had are thinner and rougher. A touch of malt lurking underneath things is shoved aside by those spicy hops (Saaz?). Quite a nice little bite. A touch of citrus appears near the dry finish. A tasty Pils; I'd say it's Prima!  overall: 3.9 appearance: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  252",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,StevieW,4.8,"Perfectly golden straw color with a nice fizzy fluffy topped white head. Noticable hop bubbles burst through the head in the Hop Devil fashion. Slight citrus, lemon, hops crisp aroama. Very balanced taste, super crisp hops dominate the start, then a very balanced middle.Unlike any other alleged Pilsener I have had. Finishes crisp and strong, with a lingering hop/lemon combination on your taste buds. Unbelievable pilsner, I only have memories of Sam Adams Golden Pilsner about 5 years ago, but this is an outstanding beer. I had alone, but would pair perfectly with a spicy bbq, or anyother summertime activity. Another Victory beer that lives up to the hype....",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,WilliamPhilaPa,4.3,"Pours a sparkling golden yellow / straw color. Foamy head is huge at first but dies rather quick. On the nose is slightly zesty, bit of citrus / lemon zest, and saaz hops. All of the same on the palate! Very good and very unique, very citrusy for a pilsnerbut I really like itvery impressive!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,mickeymac,4.2,"Prima takes Pilsener to a whole new level. It's a nice golden color with a beatiful white, pillowy head. The smell of hops is abundant but it blends nicely with the subtle malt smell. The same is true of the flavor: despite being more hoppy than most Pilseners, the flavor is well-balanced. Victory can do no wrong.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,mophie,4.92,"Golden yellow sunshine. It's hard to compare this to other Pilseners because this is so unique. Straw colored, with a billowy white head that disspiates to a lacy film. Smells zesty, lemony, herbal, floral. Saaz! Taste is unlike any pils I've ever tasted; there are so many dimensions to the flavors, yet there is incredible balance as well. Initial taste is of lemon zest and grass, then a long, lingering floral/herbal earthiness, followed by a smooth, sweet finish. On any level, this beer is hard to beat.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Bighuge,4.67,"Pours a hazy light golden with a good frothy white head. Nice spicy saaz hop aroma. Could this be dry-hopped with Saaz? After a sip you can tell this brew's got some character. Love the bitter hop bite in this brew. Good malt backing present. Medium body. Nice subtle spiciness on the palate. This is a great pilsener.  Last summer, my brother ZAP and I did a blind taste test of 13 pilseners and I rated this Number One. (It came in second place after combining both of our ratings.)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Andy,4.45,"Thick pure white head two fingers deep. Pale gold color. Very fresh hop aroma. Earthy, zingy hop flavor. Not your daddy's pilsner, but a true to style German pils. Very unusual offering for an American micro and a great step towards reinvigorating this molested style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,Murph,4.5,"Pours a Clear pale straw color with a thick, rocky white head. The smell is all hops with a strong, spicy Saaz presence. The spicy hop character jumps onto my tongue and dances around. Good, true medium body to this brew with a nice malt backbone that shows itself in the end of the taste. Crisp and dry and very drinkable. WOW. This is admittedly one of my least favorite styles. That being said, this is by far the best Pilsner I have ever had. I will be seeking it out again and again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
345,1010,DrewS,3.98,"Not my favorite style but really good nonetheless. The nice golden yellow color comes to a decent head that fades rather quickly, but is to be expected from a Pilsner. Has a somewhat sharp malt aroma that is not displeasing. Amazingly bitter for a Pilsner and is probably what makes me like it so much. All around it's pretty balanced with a solid malt body. Not very complex in the full scope of beer, but very complex when compared to others of its style. I liked it's refreshing taste and drinkability. Another beer that I would recommend.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90

345,1010,John,4.88,"I doubt any brewer, anywhere, can do much better than this. Hazy and golden, this creamy textured, smooth as silk brew is among the best. Highly hopped, though this formula exhibits minimal bitterness, leaving the aroma and flavorful, leafy hop character to prevail. Cheers to Victory Brewing. Prima indeed!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",German Pilsner,90
