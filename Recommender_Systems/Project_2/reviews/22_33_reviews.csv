22,33,Grax,2.89,"Very thick head, three fingers upon pour. Weak aroma of malt and spice. Upon taste, immediate onslaught of heavy, sparking spice and malt, heavy carbonation. Flavor is an overripe banana with spicy burn and a smooth, watery body. Not very enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,DFred,4.25,"This Belgian Dubbel pours a deep and dusky orange color with a massive off-white head and aromas of rich bread malts, smooth caramel, Belgian yeast, and spices. It has a bready taste with flavors of bread malts, smooth caramel, Belgian orange, spices, and yeast. It finishes dry and yeasty with some smooth caramel and bready undertones. Medium-bodied with strong carbonation and yeasty on the palate. It has a wonderful balance of wheat, Belgian spices, and orange citrus, with some caramel sweetness. Overall, an excellent example of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,defunksta,4.14,"Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy (60% clarity), deep and dusky orange color with a massive off-white head. (4.25)  Aroma: Strong aromas of rich bread malts, smooth caramel, and a strong Belgian yeast and spices. Bready. (4.00)  Flavor: Strong and rich flavors of bread malts, smooth caramel, Belgian orange, spices and yeast .Finishes dry and yeasty with some smooth caramel and bready undertones. (4.25)  Feel: Medium-bodied, strong carbonation and yeasty on the palate. (4.25)  Compared to Unibroue Trois Pistoles 1/2023: Pours a lighter color, similar slightly milder head. Milder aromas. More bread and yeast with Belgian spices. Less caramel and dark fruits. Dryer and yeastier.  Overall: A wonderful Belgian Dubbel here and my first official review of a Dubbel. This one has nice wheat, Belgian spices and orange citrus, with some caramel sweetness. Bready, yeasty, and dry for the ABV and body. This Dubbel of reminds me of a combination of a Tripel and Belgian version of a Weizenbock with more Belgian spices and yeast. Very nicely done. (Rating: 4.14)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,timobkg,4.24,"Pours a reddish copper with a white head that thins but lasts forever.  Aroma gives hints of spices, cherries and other stone fruit, and a bit of brown sugar. Everything is really nicely integrated so no one aroma stands out.  The flavor is a complex mix, with hints of earthy spices, and a slight sweetness balanced by slight bitterness.  The mouth feel is fantastic. Rich, full, effervescent, and dry on the finish up invite you to take another sip.  Overall this is a great Belgian style beer equal to anything brewed in Belgium. Most Belgian-style beers fail to capture the complexity and balance of Belgian ales, but Unibroue nailed it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MikeWard,3.78,"12oz bottle into a glass. Bottled 8/24/22, so 4 months old  Warm brown body with a massive off white head leaving strong lacing  Malty aroma and something else I cant put my finger (or nose) on.  Malty, but not overly sweet. There is a hint of apple core. Abv well hidden.  Mouth between medium and full, finish somewhat fruity.  Overall, not doing much for me. Not unpleasant, just seems a bit dull.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mfnmbvp,3.57,"12 oz. bottle, best by date of 02/08/2025, so we've still got a couple years. Somehow I've never tried this staple offering from Unibroue, even though it's been on BeerAdvocate since 1998. (!) A Dubbel style ale, ""Ale brewed with spices"" and ""Bottle refermented"" Possibly the first strong beer (over 8.0%) to be widely available in modern grocery stores?  Poured to Unibroue La Fin Du Monde stemware. #almostproper. I think I had a Maudite glass long ago, and it met an untimely fate. Pours a deeep burnt dark orange body. Almost barleywine-ish in color. Finger and a half of thick frothy off-white foam that leaves good big strands of lace. It looks very nice. Aroma seems faint? Lots of must, very mild alcohol presence, Belgian yeast? Earthy & twiggy, with notes of dark fruit (fig, plum, dates, cherry). It doesn't smell nearly as dark or complex as I was expecting. Taste reveals more of the same - flavors of booze-soaked cherries, Robitussin, raisins, figs, plums, cream, alcohol heat. Again, not nearly as complex as I was expecting - not nearly as layered or deep as I thought it would be. No brown bread or bread crust. Straight up booze soaked fruit. Slightly disappointed by this aspect, but the beer's remarkably high drinkablility almost makes up for it. This thing is exceptionally smooth & creamy, which is I think where the trick lies. Crisply carbonated, but not distracting. The beer drinks extremely easy for 8.00% abv. Overall, this one feels tricky for me, as I wanted to like it much more than I actually did. Worthy, but not a likely contender for repeat drinking.  Unibroue Maudite -----3.75/5",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

L: Pours dark rust amber almost transparent w very high carbonation, a lively 3/4"" light khaki head that is self-energizing, random spotty lacing. S: Sour dark fruits, cherry, a hint of vinegar, gently woody, clove, allspice, a suggestion of bread, banana (esp as beer warms). T: Caramelized & roasted malts, earthy overripe dark fruits, a sensation of dark honey, light citrus zest, coriander, mahogany, leather, air-dried old wood. Excellent balance. Lightly sharp with a touch of sourness then roasted malts and sugars mingle. F: Alive, brisk and vibrant med to med-heavy and smooth feel w a med-length med-dry finish that is gentle.

It is outstanding in its style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BubbleBobble,3.69,"Pours an opaque deep tan, soft 1.5"" head that thing out to a solid quarter inch, a bit on the light side; nice, streaking lacing. Nose is brown sugar, clove, allspice, banana, and some earthy hop notes as well; light roast as well as it warms. Taste leads candy, sugary sweet with only light baking spice notes to rein things in. Sweetness dissipates quickly, however, as warming notes from the alcohol become more prominent. As the beer warms, light spice and banana come through, but the dominant flavor is brown sugar, and the beer is lacking in depth. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth with mild but bright carbonation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,WunderLlama,4.21,"#2 dubbed as ranked on beer advocate  Bottle poured into a large nonic  Brewers Notes: Without a doubt Unibroue’s best-known beer, La Maudite is inspired by abbey beers and Belgian double-style ales. It first hit the shelves in 1992 and took the province by storm with its 8% alcohol content, making it the first strong beer available in grocery stores.  That’s where the idea came to tie its name and branding to a pact signed with the devil. The illustration of the “chasse-galerie” (or flying canoe) from a belove  Translucent copper liquid crowned by a pencil thin taupe layer , recedes to a thin layer  Aroma is if caramel, malts  Taste is slightly sweet , caramel ,malts  Fizzy , sudsy mouthfeel  Good beer",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,cjgiant,4.02,"A near opaque matte, dull rust/copper body with an aggressive but not violent red clay tinged head. Lacing is pretty good. Nose is a mix of toast, spice, and yeasty notes including a little bubble gum. The toasted grain lays a nice foundation for a mix of orchard fruit jam and fall spices. The opening feel is nice, punching in around medium with a softness, but the carbonation ends up a little less restrained than the head it helps produce. A nice balance of malt and bitterness, with quite complimentary flavors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CBlack85,4.09,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a DFH Goblet Glass  The beer pours a murky copper color with about three fingers worth of foamy white head that slowly recedes leaving some light lacing behind  The aroma is sweet and malty with notes of toasted bread, raisins, plums, banana, and caramel. There is also a spicy aroma that compliments the sweetness  Like the nose, the flavor is sweet and malty with notes of toasted bread and dark fruits. Lightly spicy with some caramel and toffee that rounds it out. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated with a smooth finish  Overall, Maudite is a nice beer with a lot going for it. Very nice",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,LeRose,4.06,"This is a bottle from 2011, so please take that into account with this review.  It pours a muddy reddish-brown that seems to be in line with fresh, but not much of a head. Clears decently as it warms up.  The smell is fruity, both the raison fig contingent and some nice apple. Slightly spicy, peppery, heavy on the bread. Very weak banana when fully warmed.  The taste opens sweet and spicy, black pepper and coriander. The pepper sensation lingers thru and continues well after the swallow. The sweetness morphs into the fig/raisin fruit thing rather nicely. I thought the malty bready notes would be stronger, but they show up almost as a third layer of flavor. There's a toffee flavor that I think can be chalked up to age. It's kind of a subdued malt bomb where the malt is strong, but the supporting cast gets equal billing.  Mildly carbonated, peppery tingle lingers, sweet but not sticky, and towards the dry side despite the sweet part.  Overall, this tastes pretty fine. I'd buy it again based on how it tastes now. I'm feeling it has lost some edge but has mellowed into something pleasant.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,AlexandraDen,4.24,"Pours a cloudy, deep ochre colour in a tall goblet. Generous 4-5 inch head slowly condenses into a thick two inch head supported by the carbonation over the next 15 minutes.  Smells are lovely and complex. Overall spicy smells up front followed by gentle malts. Lots of bread, spices, peppery stuff here.  What a lovely taste. There are three parts on most of my sips. The up front — strong and peppery, coriander and Black pepper. Followed by the middle, which comes quickly after the spicy sip — malts and hop character swirl around, sweet bread and yeast followed by some grassy, clove-like bitterness. It ultimately finishes with the strong malt, yeast backbone, and the coriander and orange citrus notes can absolutely be noticed here.  As the beer warmed and I continued to sip I noticed a tiny bit of candied plum flavours in the finish, which again, was strongly malt forward and relatively sweet.  Beer is medium-ish bodied, smooth, nice carbonation, the alcohol doesn’t present a strong bite here anywhere. Finishes sweet but mostly dry.  This is overall quite a gorgeous beer. The one time I’m happy to be in Canada when it comes to beer is being so close to Unibroue. We can’t import international beers, and our offerings are tightly controlled by the government liquor boards, but we always always always can get the first pickings of Unibroue’s beers. Their winter collection is awesome. Maudite is an excellent beer and it has been 10 years ago when I first tried it, and is excellent to this very day.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,Singlefinpin,4.43,"Drinking this at The Parsons Pub in downtown Murphy NC. Poured from a 12 fluid ounce bottle into a pint glass. Looks deep Amber with a very nice tight foamy head that lasted. Smells bready, spicy, coriander, yeast. Taste follows the nose nicely, complex melding of flavors make this really nice. Mouth feel is medium for the style.

22,33,Brutaltruth,4.25,"A classic. From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This excellent dubbel pours a amber tinged brown with a nice head of white foam that settles to a thick ring, thin dusty layer, and shows off some nice light lacing. Nose of clove, coriander, dark candy sugar touches, dates, figs, and spicy yeast notes. Flavors follow nicely with dark bread, spicy yeast, herbal balanced hops, dates, fig, candy sugar, and coriander. Nice mouth feel; medium body, light soft carbonation, and a balanced sweet and lightly spicy finish.  Of note, with warmth some white pepper comes into play.  Overall, a classic that is just as good as when I had it in the 90's!  Cheers",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,blazerkor,4.25,Smells fruity and dark with malts sweetening the scent further.  The taste is balanced. It's mostly clean malts with funky Belgian yeast in the background.  The mouthfeel is fantastic. It's medium bodied with a lot of bubbly carbonation to feel like silk. The finish starts bitter and then gets fruity.  It's a really phenomenal double. One of the best Belgians I've had. I give it a 5.1 out of 6.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,sulldaddy,4.23,"Sampling a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter. I picked this up at a local beer store recently to keep checking off Beers of Fame! The beer pours a fairly clear amber to mahogany color with a fluffy beige colored head of about 3 cm. This foam fades slowly leaving some sticky lattice on my glass. The aroma has some light caramel malt and a bit of cloves and light cinnamon. No real hop presence and the 8% booze is hidden too. the nose is sort of mild overall, but is appealing and works for the style. The first sip reveals a medium body with slightly syrupy texture and fine tingly carbonation. Feels like its a little bit of a bigger beer. Flavor is malty up front with caramel and some brown sugar and then rolls to a bit of green apple hit and quickly gives over to spices of clove and cinnamon. I get a bit of black pepper bite on the finish and mild warming booze on the swallow. This is a fun beer to revisit after quite a hiatus. Im going to circle back to many of the Unibroue line again. This is worth a sampling for a Dubbel with some spiciness.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Its beige head poofs up like a bag of popcorn and has to be dispensed gradually, lest it overflow from the glass. Retention is short lived and leaves limited lacing to speak of.  Bouquet: A bucketful of malted, malty malts. Mixed in are dried cloves, whole grain bread, and strangely: apple peel with the barest touch of molasses at the finish.  Feel: An upbeat prickle of carbonation lofting about within a mildly bitter, medium frame.  Taste: Upfront you’ll experience an avaricious mouthful of brown sugar and allspice over bananas.

Head didn't really shrink, so there was no lacing. Still had some head half an hour later.  Light caramel malt scent. Swirling the glass only boosted the caramel a small amount, probably because the head blocked it.  Mostly caramel malt in the flavor. Some citrus that came through as lime to start and then shifted to other mild fruit flavors. Hint of spice and a light burn that might be from spices or the higher alcohol. Slight bitters.  Tongue tingling as it turns into a light foam. Slight burn.  Typical Belgian dubbel with spice and fruit flavors. Good representative of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,MonDak_Joe1953,4.24,"12oz bottle. Stamped on bottle is best by date of '02-07-22'. Medium amber color body, with some cloudiness. Pours a high off white head, which stays around as a compact, small bubble cap. Not much for lacing. Smells of bready malt and phenolic spice. There is also some dark fruit and toffee. Taste of bready malts and cherry like fruit. Banana, clove, and toffee mix in. Some yeast dryness at the end/earthy. Has a filling feeling in the mouth, but the body is medium, but the swallow is thicker. Some effervescence on the tongue. Very good carbonation. This is a treat to drink as a beer that expresses bread, dark fruit, spice, toffee, and a dry finish. ABV% is felt but does not intrude.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MNAle,4.06,"12 oz bottle allowed to warm from a 45degF refrigerator for 10 minutes, poured into a 16 oz goblet.  Tall, creamy white head with a slightly tan tint. Beer is dark brown from the front but amber-ruby through a backlight. Ample carbonation. The lacing is not too thick, but nice looking.  Aroma is bread, dark fruits, and spice. After a few minutes, the spiciness begins to become the most prominent part of the aroma.  Feel is on the thin side of moderate, but quite effervescent.  Taste is earthy, with just a touch of drying astringency. The fruitiness trends toward cherry rather than raisins or figs. This gives it a ""new world"" take on the style while remaining true to the Belgian origins. Quite enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Harrison8,4.21,"Pours a translucent burgundy with a finger and a half of off-white foam. Head retention is fantastic. Aroma is dark and stone fruits, toffee, caramel, clove, zesty hops and toasty, nutty, bready malts. There is a little zeasty yeast ester along with banana at the close. Robust sweetness up front that's bolstered and supported by hearty malts. Flavor profile is less thick and sticky, but more focused - hitting notes of toffee, dark fruits, caramel, banana, clove, and caramely, toasty, bready malts. It breaks apart a little the palate, coming along more in a thin, consistent line vs. the flavor blast of the aroma. Mouth feel is medium-thick with an expansive, fuzzy texture that carries the expansive flavor profile well. Overall, depth and complexity without lingering or sticking qualities. It's robust and flavorful.  Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S - Yeast jumps out, a touch of light brown sugar, some raisin, and fresh fig in there as well. T - Follows the nose quite well, add just a bit of earthy yeast and some brown bread. M - A bit thin in a good way, sweet start never lets up, light brown sugar, and notes of toffee add a nice touch O - A very good offering and with a full year stock here a treat to have every few weeks.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S: Lightly pungent with aromas of cloves and light cardamom, banana, leather and earth. T: Semisweet to sweet. Flavor pallet spicy with stronger caramel and brown sugar maltiness evident than in the nose, but otherwise largely derived therefrom. Bitterness provides solid balance with the sweetness (and alcohol). M: Medium to full bodied with robust effervescence. Almost chewy and leaves a strong tingling in the mouth.

The nose on this hits initially with an undoubtedly clear coffee aroma, but is instantly followed up with heavy spice and caramel notes. The combination gives almost a Belgian-inspired Mexican hot chocolate nose. Weird and unexpected, but very pleasant.  Spicy, malty, and with a noticeable hop presence.

Admittedly, I'm a fanatic of Belgian Ales, so my ratings may be biased towards favoring them.  I was originally withdrawn from my initial pour. It had a deeper color than I expected as well as a sub-par head. It did however show excellent carbonation which was immediately realized.  The smell gives you a wide-range of spices and it does not fail to deliver it in it's taste.  While a lover a Belgians, I am equally biased against darker beers.

It had a light head, no staying power, and just a touch a lacing but that's being generous. The smell was a very complex - boozy, sweet, with yeast foundation that all worked quite well with each other. Mouthfeel was full-bodied and though considerably carbonated not so much that it detracted from the overall experience. Speaking of that, the taste was a nice blend of booze, a touch of caramel sweetness to my buds, and the distinctive base that comes with dark ales.

22,33,Jonoesh5,3.66,"Excited to review one of the original Unibroue beers. This is my introduction to this Montreal brewery. Pours a hazy copper brown with a minimal beige head. The nose is malt-forward (oats and barley), nutty, and cleaning solution. First sip is super carbonated! Overwhelming so, like a sparkling water or something. The sharp, spicy, boozy flavor up front is off-putting, distracting from the rest of the palette. Not inviting :/ However, after the beer warms, caramel sweetness, fruitcake (prune and brown sugar), and rum notes open up. This is the last of a 4-pack I bought at a local liquor store (bottles dated ""BB-12-15-18"") , and I still can't forgive how over-carbonated this beer is. Not at all creamy or frothy. Feels more like a flat, english brown ale like NewCastle.  Overall, I wonder if the ""Best Buy"" date on these bottles greatly affected the quality of my experience(??) The only date on this 4-pack read ""BB 12-15-18"". I drank these beers before 12-5-17, as I've heard that any beer that sits longer than 2.5 months after it's bottled date looses it's flavor clarity. This is why I wish every beer had a ""Bottled On"" date to prevent this guess work! ANYWAY...Maudite is a fine cold-weather beer, but I wont be buying this beer again anytime soon. The boozy flavor distracts from the rest of the taste, and the mouthfeel is over-carbonated. On to La Fin Du Monde, or Trois Pistoles!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,Lone_Freighter,4,"Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a chalice. The appearance was a nice looking dark brown to hazy black color with a soft gentle rolling leveling half fingered white foamy head that dissipates at a nice pace. The lacing that is there speckles the sides nicely. The smell had a rich sort of dark chocolate to raisins and adds in a nice rich yeasty/breadiness to an herbal yet spicy complexity. The taste was spicy and sweet with a distinctive yeasty raisin-like quality hitting the taste buds. The aftertaste was sweet and spicy and lets a nice sharp spicy sweet finish. On the palate, it sits about a medium almost leaning closer to the heavier sort of side. The carbonation is good for the style which comes across not too harsh but just enough to make it feel good across my mouth and tongue. Overall, in my opinion, this was a wonderful offering from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Followed by more subtle flavors of vanilla, ginger, and even lime. F- Perfect balance between creamy, bubbly, and weight of body with the perfect slight dry and spicy finish from the hops. O- Not much else i can say about this beer other than being essentially perfect. It does a fantastic job of balancing itself between deliciously creamy while all the while not being too creamy.

22,33,Pundit_of_Potability,4.15,"Its always nice to buy something by Unibroue, because you can almost count on it being first class. This one pours a nice brown with a thick head and much lacing. The flavor is roasted malts that leave a bit of a bitter aftertaste, with a slight chocolate hint along with a wee bit of raisiny sweetness and breadiness. It finishes with a tad bit of tartness (along with that note of bitterness). After a while, the finish became a little much.

Not a whole lot on the nose except for Keebler fudge cookie, plum, kilned malts, and more chocolate.  Flavor starts off tasteless, with a wave of intense carbonation, but then explodes into notes of plum, fig, apples, chocolate, whipped cream, animal cracker, and peaches. A touch of cinnamon, a touch of sage. It seems more gentle than it is, but it's really intense overall. Just a burning chocolate plum hunk of love. Burning thanks to the alcohol.  Feel is wet, heavily carbonated, and burning. Semi-dry parch due to the alcohol.  Overall, this was fabulous. I'll go back for more...a 4 pack maybe. World Class for sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smell gives off some brown sugar and molasses with overripe apricots - plenty of fuity, yeasty esters floating around in the bowl of my glass. Flavor is a bit sweeter and spicier, though more restrained than I expected. The hops are very mild, probably just enough to keep this beer from being straight soda. Cloves and a hint of cardamom are present. Mouthfeel is thin but oily, and even if the finish doesn't stick around long, the feel sure does.

Taste: Red apples, spicy Belgian yeast, cherries, raisins, caramel and very mild chocolate . Sweet and dry, low alcohol profile.  Feel: Well carbonated and smooth. Silky and rich.

Aroma: Oranges, very fruity and spicy yeast aromas dominate. Smells like a fair bit of candi sugar has gone into this one.  Taste: Spicy up front, then bitter in the finish as the hops kick in. You've got the sweetness of a dark Belgian ale upfront then quite quickly you get the dryness of a blond.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, slight prickling from the carbonation and then a very dry finish.  Overall: Not bad, I was expecting more flavour wise and was looking forward to a big finish, which I suppose it has got if you like the addition of very bitter hops with your Belgian yeast and spice flavours. Personally I wouldn’t buy this again though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,teromous,3.63,"The back of the bottle on the shoulder has a best buy date printed: 10-30-18  Appearance: The body is a medium brown color that is opaque yet allows a hazy light to spread through the glass showing off dark burnt umber and auburn. The head is thick and fluffy with a light off-white appearance. It fades to a short cap that maintains a solid head and delivers a good ring of lacing.  Aroma: Sweet coriander hits me in the face the moment I approach the beer. That massive aroma of coriander dominates the nose but I do find some raisin in there working its way along with the light scent of alcohol.  Taste: Again the coriander takes center stage here but it is carried along with a short chorus of sweet malt and a bit of honey in the finale.  Mouthfeel: Light presence on the palate and a similarly light body that borders on the lower edge of medium. The beer is highly carbonated and finishes rather crisp and dry.  Overall: A tasty Belgian Strong Dark Ale that makes heavy use of coriander to cover the lack of more traditional flavors found in this style. That is not to say that the beer is not enjoyable, it is just missing a few pieces in its puzzle. It is enjoyable and I would recommend it to a person who really loves coriander. Given the alternatives in the market for Belgian Strong Dark Ale's it would not be preferred.

Smell has a mixture of straw, yeast, and malts aromas with undertones of lemon zest and maybe some floral notes.  Taste follows the nose with an initial malty belgian yeast flavor coming through, then on the aftertaste you get this rich array of spices and a subdued but very bitter aftertaste. The spice flavors include clove, pepper, nutmeg and cinnamon. There is a dryness to the finish that it unexpected but very nice. As I continue to sip I'm more aware of the malt depth - bready caramel malts come through with undertones of a honey like sweetness. Still the bitterness from the hops cuts that sweetness on the finish.  Feel is directed by the medium carbonation on this beer - keeps it fizzy as you sip. Very dry, coats your tongue and throat as it goes down. Seems a bit watery for a strong dark ale - something I notice with most of Unibroue's beers.  Overall a very nice Belgian Dark Ale.

In the light, you can almost — almost! — see an argument for calling this an “Amber Red Ale,” as it says on the label. That is, it is still a very dark brown, with reddish hues. Quite clear (until the last bit is swirled and added — lees!) and bubbly. Head retains surprisingly well for how fizzy this beer seems. Light beige, thick, consistent, fine, film-forming. Cider-like aromas, bread and toast suggestions, and little else. And what do you know, apple or apple cider notes throughout, although incredibly watered down, moderately tart and not overly sweet. Pay closer attention and just maybe you’ll notice the vinegaresque flavors, the candy sugar, the alcohol, or the phenols. Medium to full in body, effervescent (even though I was reasonably expecting more soda-like feel), choppy, and velvety. Evenly warming.

Look -- Pours a deep amber with a decidedly orange tinge with 3 fingers of off-white head that settles down to 2 and leaves rings of lacing on the glass.  Smell -- Ripe banana, apple, orange, somewhat vinous with subdued clove. The alcohol is well hidden and all in all it makes me think of cafeteria fruit salad (in a good way).  Taste -- As with the nose but a malty sweetness and slight nuttiness joins the party along with a nice bracing bitterness. The alcohol is hidden here as well.  Feel -- A moderate to heavy body but the lively carbonation keeps it light on the palate.  Overall -- It's a fantastic ale, it brings to mind a cross between fruit salad and banana bread that's all beautifully counterbalanced by the hop bitterness. It goes down dangerously easy given the ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,Beginner2,4.29,"10/19/19 total revision and re-rate of my my 2016 review that evolved lengthily with each tasting. Maudite is the 2nd most frequently rated beer in the style and ranked #2 for quality; so I doubt I will say anything new. And I'm going to guess I've had Maudite over a dozen times. And after several additions and changes in my review, I think the hodge-podge condition of that review speaks to the importance of rewriting the reviews of classics and popular ales... and getting Karma points for it.  So I start a new review with my previous conclusion: Unibroue may cultivate the most interesting yeasts in North America. Before I tell you why I think this, consider what the master reviewers have said.  Michael Jackson 1999 ""Pocket Edition"" gave this 2.5 of 4 stars and declared it ""A Belgian style russet ale."" (IMHO, The Venerable MJ did not like this brew as much those who followed... including a founder of BA's site.... on the other hand, good brewers learn fast and maybe Unibroue improved the recipe.)  Reviewed in the ""1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die"", page 191. Maudite deserves to be there as Unibroue's success in bringing Belgium (and its cultivation of yeasts) to North America and interpreting that extraordinary beer culture. Maudite also is reviewed at length in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic ""300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"" He states that the brewer says this could cellar for seven years. I doubt if it ever made it past one year in my cellar.  Unibroue's sampler pack is how I usually get Maudite. But, it is plenty good to buy a 4-pack and savor over the shorter days and with more complex dishes. Maudite shows Unibroue's high carbonation, similar to the Trappist tendency. This complements meals by cleansing the palate for more food. But bubbles (in Unibroue's able hands) also subtracts from the brew's fruitiness becoming too sweet and letting it meld with stewed foods and soup. The bubbles/sweet toss-up can go either way. In Maudite's case, the consumer ends up the winner.  Overall: Perhaps one of the Top Ten dubbels on the planet and one I should have more often. Maudite may deserve to have me revise this review yet again, but after 2235 characters I should instead keep count over at Untappd.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The beer pours a nice medium amber color, burgundy hues, cloudy and predominantly opaque with just a touch of clarity that leads to some bright garnet hues when hit by the light. A soft, foamy off white head rises from the beer, about two fingers high that has great retention and yields plenty of lace. The aroma is nice, strong malted barley, rich and grainy, a bit of clove, spice, yeasty with some lingering stone fruits. The flavors support the nose well, lots of heavy grains, bready, malty and sweet with some spice character, yeasty, clove, very smooth flavors with some fruit sweetness and alcohol heat at the finish. The mouthfeel is superb, coating, full bodied, gentle carbonation but enough to prop up the body with a smooth finish that is lightly warming.  Verdict: A very nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale, though I believe they classify this as a dubbel. It has a really nice depth of flavor, balanced complexity and doesn't have any sharp alcohol character, which is really nice. I found myself enjoying this more and more as I drank it, though it does ring a bit sweeter than I'd like.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,98green,3.92,"From bottle to a snifter. Look is a dark brown, mostly opaque. Thin head full of tiny bubbles. Smell is Belgian yeast. Taste is oddly a bit sour, flavors are raisins and dark fruit. Feel is very high carbonation, which seems to be a thing with unibroue bottles. Alcohol comes through a bit, but not too much. Overall a good example of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Gajo74,4.31,"Poured a mostly brown color with hints of mahogany and ruby. A large and dense foam head nearly overflowed, the lace retains well almost until the end. Lots of interesting aromas in this one. I am first hit with what I can best describe as a citric and almost tart smell thats hard to pinpoint. Later, the sweet caramel malt and bubblegum aromas are clearly detected. There are also spices, notably cloves. As the drink warms I also detect banana and tropical fruit. At first this beer, as with many other belgian style brews, has a tight carbonation that is crisp. However, this drink really comes into its own as it warms and the flavors and nuances truly come out. Sweet caramel malt, dark fruit, spicy clove, mild phenols, alcohol taste well masked but it warms you nevertheless, mild herbal hops. The finish is sweet. The body is medium and chewy but very drinkable. Thus far I have enjoyed all of Unibroue's offerings, and this one is no exception. Great to drink alone or with a hearty meal.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Prunes sultanas and apple cider. Funky, a bit sharp as in a hint of sour. Baking spices. Plenty of warming with a brandy like flavour. Creamy as hell.  Smooth spicy and a mature sweet. Great all around",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,GOBLIN,4.08,"As noted by a previous rater Unibroue sure can make a beer with outstanding head retention that seems to last forever. Other than the huge head on this the appearance is typical for the style. Aromas are nice with a candied sweetness. Taste is lacking in my opinion for a Belgian Strong Dark but not below average by any stretch. Feel is nice as well, prickly and well carbonated. Overall, another terrific example by Unibroue but I think I prefer Trois Pistoles over this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,tekstr1der,4.31,"Master of head retention is Unibroue - this pours a hazy brown with tan clingy pillow on top. Aroma of cooked sugar, brown bread, and a slight sour yeastiness.

22,33,Nugganooch,3.9,"From the 355ml foil wrapped bottle to my Societe Brewing Chalice glass Notes taken on 05/31/2015  A: A dark russet body is showcased with some cloudy yeast sediment obscuring the clarity somewhat. Has some lovely shades of brown and auburn to it with a densely packed khaki tan head capped over top. Great retention efforts noted here as the head never fully subsides back down. A few squeaky bubbles and swaths of lace are left clinging on to the glass.  S: Dried banana peel with some light clove spice, cracked pepper, and coriander. Malt bread and lightly toasted grain come together with some black currants and an earthy mineral like quality. Not the most fragrant nose but it is nice and pleasant with some warming Belgian spices noted.  T: A superb balance between the Belgo spice yeast and bready malt base. I get lots of citrusy coriander mixed with the spice of peppercorns and clove, and a pinch of banana peel. Pronounced spices but not super phenolic which is what I prefer. There is some dark cherry like fruitiness to this alongside the toasted bread and light graininess. Caramel seems present to this as well but it’s not particularly sweet to me. Finishes out with some earthy minerals and alcohol spice. Again nothing really over the top in flavor but nice and well balanced.  M: Moderate filling body with a creamy feel from an upper level amount of perceived carbonation. Bitterness is kept at a minimum while the finish is dry with some warming alcohol noted.  D: Not the most complex or intriguing of dark ales but a well-crafted one none the less. Unibroue definitely makes some very approachable Belgians that are also easy on the old pocketbook. Just not the depth I look for in this style to make me say wow.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,kaiyote,4.79,"Unibroue continues to amaze me. I've had most of their brews now, and each has been uniquely delightful. I don't know how they do it.  Look: Extremely dark red, nearly black, with a decent off-white head, that lasts for a while. Smell: Dark fruits, secrets, mystery. Taste: Indescribable, simply amazing. Smooth dark fruits wash over your palate, leaving no stone unturned. Simply a pleasure to drink. Feel: Amply carbonated, but not over carbonated. Just right for the brew. Overall: There's simply some quality about Unibroue that keeps me coming back for more. I hope they never change a thing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Perhaps some subtle toffee notes if you search for it  Mouthfeel: Medium body; Very creamy with almost no bitterness. More of a drying effect  Overall: Another winner belgian ale from Unibroue. 4/4 so far. Not quite as good as La Fin Du Monde or Trois Pistoles, but it is still complex and balanced between apple esters, spices, yeast, and toffee notes.

22,33,mlockman,3.87,"Really badass logo, and the foil on top is a real nice touch. Didn't realize until until I had pried the cap off that it was a twist-off, which is convenient. Even with the gentlest of pours, this creates a gorgeous, thick, fluffy head. While this dissipated quickly, it looked AWESOME. The smell was rather subdued, and the taste was clean and crisp without any lengthy finish to speak of. Very good, but it reminds me a lot of Ommegang's Three Philosophers; much more reminiscent of a Quad than a Dark Strong in my opinion.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,BradtheGreat7,4.29,"Review taken multiple times over the last 5 years. These notes were taken in May 2014.  12 oz brown bottle with beautiful gold fading to black foil around the cap and neck. The artwork is pretty stunning as well with a small boat full of damned or cursed men flying to their doom. Great piece of artwork. Poured into a stemmed Belgian tulip glass with a wide flare at the top.  A - murky haze. A deep amber red with hints of reddish brown in color with even hints of red orange in the light. Beige head pours quite large leaving a big frothy ring of sticky lace.  S - bready malt, ripe fruit, orange, and big whiff of alcohol esters and wonderful Unibroue yeast notes with spices of coriander and clove. Has a floral character as it warms.  T - lovely ripe fruitiness alongside a pretty pronounced orange note. Belgian style spices, coriander, clove, and a hint of black pepper. Yeast and floral notes are balanced perfectly over a breaded malt and fruity alcohol esters.  M - medium bodied and flavorful. Texture is as you would expect from the style. Crisp like finish and the alcohol only adds to its complexity. Lovely feel.  O - a brilliant dark ale from Unibroue. This may be my favorite offering from them and that's saying something considering all the fine ales they bottle. Pure class of a brewery and their creative brewing and style are on full display with Maudite. Fantastic Belgian style ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheHammer,4.28,"Appearance: A solid thumb of head that sadly did not stick around but produced some lacing. The body is a fig coloured brown that has a unique dullness to it, but shows amber and red notes quite well. There is ample carbonation in the body but also quite a bit of smaller then sand yeast in the mix, which is more a result of my pour being a bit to long.  Smell: A strong yeast that really presents itself as figs which berry touches. There's is a potent toffee backing to it that comes across as something that is lying in wait. There is also a slight floral note that comes out as the beer warms up.  Taste: Starts with a solid dose of toffee flavoured malt with a slight touch of chocolate which builds very quickly into a fruity yeast as figs, stone-fruit and citrus arise and then somewhat give way to a spicy clove with floral and herbal hop end.  Feel: The carbonation helps out the entire beer, and while the transitioning is a bit quick, it is still solid. A nice dark toffee and figgy aftertaste stick around after drinking which leaves a very restrained dryness.  Drinkability: It hides it's ABV quite well, it's medium bodied which was surprising, the carbonation doesn't get out of control after you've had it and it's very easy to drink and doesn't come across as the beer you can only drink at an event.  Final Thoughts: Much like the other brews I've had from Unibroue, this one impresses. While it is no Fin Du Monde, it's still an awesome beer. As I said, this one I could drink anytime, anywhere but I could really see it going good with mussels. Two thumbs up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,Redneckwine,4.29,"12oz bottle into tulip  Appearance - Medium brown and super murky, awesome 2 finger fluffy head sticks around a long time and leaves good lacing.  Smell - Big, musty, yeasty dark fruits with a touch of cocoa. Spicy yeast is fairly dominant.  Taste - Just about follows the nose completely, but the dark, fruity, slightly vinous character shines through a bit more. Cocoa and toasted bread maltiness brings a solid hit of candy sweetness and blends nicely with the spicy yeast phenols. There's a feint, odd astringent/minerally note towards the end, which could be some booze. Finish is yeasty, earthy, fruity, and dries up a bit to an off-dry finish.  Feel - Medium/full body, but damnit if it doesn't feel like just swiggin' on a 5% brew. Carbonation is very ample and crisp yet retains a great creamy quality. Nicely done.  Overall - Pretty killer BSDA here folks. Hovering at 8% ABV, it's on the lighter side of the BSDA game, and the body is so masterfully done that it feels like a 5% beer. I'm not the biggest fan of that weird little minerally note (maybe just the water?), but other than that this is a great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

T: Toast and bread crust with complex spices and a strong yeasty presence. Dark fruits, clove, caramel, burnt cadni sugar, earth, and lasting residual sugary sweetness. M: Fluffy and heavily carbonated. O: Really this style is just becoming a big turn off for me, though I recognize the depth and complexity here - it's just not for me. If you want a heavily yeast-forward Belgian Strong Dark Ale though, look no further.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Givemebeer,3.74,"Don't get me wrong, very good beer. Judging by style however, I prefer many other Belgian strong darks to this. Glad to be drinking this on Christmas - But I notice a more full bodied and complex beer from the folks at Gouden Carolous.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,Bunman3,4.15,"This is a lovely beer and I'm glad I gave it a chance. I first encountered Maudite many years ago and was not ready to appreciate its complexity. Like other Unibroue beers, the nose is yeasty, though this beer is agreeable right from the start. It pours beautifully and looks great throughout the sampling. The flavour is definitely on the sweet side - notes of clove and brown sugar, but overall it reminds me of home baked banana bread. In terms of price and accessibility, I'm not sure you can find a better deal out there...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The head lasted a very long time, and left a nice coating on the inside of the glass.  Smell: Pleasant, with a sweetness. The is some hops bitterness in the aroma, as well as a spices. The various aromas make for an interesting contrast.  Taste: An interesting mix of hops, citrus, and herbs in the flavor, that make for an interesting and complex IPA, but with a little bit of sweetness. There is a nice after-taste, that lasts for a while but not too long.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and crisp, with a medium body.  Overall: This is an interesting Belgian Ale. There is a variety of flavors, but none of these flavors overshadow the other flavors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Taste: caramel, caramelized banana, toast, again with the clove, ripe pear and pear skin in the finish. Spice overload, otherwise not much going on. Decent, certainly. Best by 07/2016.  Somewhat fresher BB 07/2018 - more of clove and coriander, caramel apple, no banana.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Phocion,4.07,"12 oz. bottle with a BB date of 12-03-16 poured into a Duvel tulip. Dark mahogany with a finger and a half of surprisingly light-colored off-white head. Thick 2-3cm head lasts until the beer is gone and is followed down by a thick, sticky, solid sheet of lacing.  Very yeast-forward aroma. Spicy clove and coriander phenols. Strongly estery; both tropical (banana) and dark/stone fruits (fig, black cherry). Rich caramelized brown (candi?) sugar and freshly baked bread, along with a generic Munich-like maltiness. Light floral hops.  Rich toasted and caramelized malts along combine with a slight alcohol burn, followed by a nice spicy tingle in the back of my mouth. Lightly bitter hoppiness provides a good finish. Alcohol is warming but doesn't burn. Yeast still dominates as it does in the nose.  Highly carbonated, medium body which feels a tad heavier due to the ABV. Warm and creamy.  Overall Maudite is a wonderful beer. It's a great New World BDSA, but rated to style it doesn't quite stand up to some of the heavier hitters in its category. Nonetheless, for its availability and (relative) affordability, this beer and Unibroue in general are a great accessible way to scratch your Belgian itch.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,kevofficiel,4,"La Maudite Beer.... The look of it: Well very special. Very brown, I think its a mix between a red ale and a blonde ale. And it suppose to be a dark ale. Lots and lots of carbonation. The smell of it. Lots of spices. Very rich. Nice flavour tho !. Now the taste: A bit disappointed I will say. I spicy taste with a touch of ginger. The hight % of ABV make the alcohol very present. But whats makes me upset a bit, is that La fin du Monde or Don de Dieu have a higher ABV and have a alcohol burn less present. Its more smooth on those beer, but Maudite does the opposite so that made my mark go down on this. If I didn t knew la Fin du Monde or Don De dieu I would give Maudite a 4,5/5 but since I reviewed it just perviously that makes my expectation high. So overall would I recommend it ? Sure, still a pretty good damn beer. But Leffe Brune does a better job on this departement.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

M: finishes fairly crisp, but also really smooth. Nice and complex and a real pleasure to drink. Overall: Really good. Hides the alcohol very well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,taxandbeerguy,4.16,"341 ml bottle served cool into a pint glass. Purchased as part of the Unibroue tasters pack. About $2.25 CDN per bottle.  Appearance - amber and honey brown in color, topped by a monstrous multi finger head even with a gentle pour.opaque with a tremendous amount of bubbles. The head is ever lasting. Cascading lacing just drips down the inside of the glass.  Smell - yeasty and spicy, some orchard fruits and has some notes more reminiscent of a tripel or saison, rather than a strong dark ale. Nice, but I'm not blown away by this aroma. Some caramel or candied goods as it warms.  Taste - smooth delicate, candied sugars, sweet caramel, some sweet fruits such as cherry and a touch of chocolate. Delicious and alcohol is hidden so subtly.  Mouthfeel - smooth, amazingly light body, with a high carbonated feel.  Overall - a delicious representation of a great style. It doesn't get much better than this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A dark amber color, but the taste is crisp and clean, well carbonated. Sweetness is present as well. I found myself enjoying it and will have another.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheCondor,4.06,"I picked this beer up, even though I was convinced I had it before, on this most recent trip to the store. I thought it was an amber ale, it was not until I read up on it that I realized it was a Belgian Strong Dark. Regardless, side poured with appropriate vigor from the bottle into a Chimay chalice.  Appearance - Pours a beautiful, muddy amber brown color, kinda like muddy river water but obviously thicker and not as gross. Bubbly one finger head dissipates relatively quickly and leaves little lacing. Carbonation continues to rise up from the beer to the head for some time.  Smell - Dark fruits, raisins being the most prominent. Spices, such as cloves and maybe coriander, also make themselves apparent in the nose. Caramel as well.  Taste - The dark fruits are the first and most distinct on the palate. Black cherries and raisins combine with a light syrup sweetness, caramel, and the spice notes to form a complex, distinctive, and enjoyable brew.  Mouthfeel - Well carbonated, finishes clean, smooth, and tart. Very appealing finish, probably the best part about the beer, in contention with the appearance.  Overall - This is a good beer, although not as good as its rating suggests in my opinion. If you really want a good example of the BSDA, go with Chimay Blue, Brother Thelonious, or even Rochefort 8. This was certainly worth trying though, and is a quality beer. Condor recommended and approved.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,UrbanCaveman,4.23,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at approximately 50 degrees F.  A: Pours the washed-out gold of thin cheap honey, but pools in the glass a warm orange-amber, capped with a spectacularly frothy pale head tinged ever so slightly orangeish. It is a cloudy brew, where one can sort of see the shadowy outline of their fingers on the far side of the glass.  S: Sweet caramel and candi sugar reign supreme in the nose, beneath which there are tones of citrus and herbal spices - tangerine, thyme, faint clove, and the like. A touch of banana and pear fruitiness rounds out the aroma, which has that distinct Unibroue yeast feel overall.  T: Sweet, sweet beer, this is a Belgian amber indeed. Caramel malts swirl across the palate beneath waves of fruit and spice, forming an ever-changing taste as the beer goes down. The citrus presence is noticeable, sharing some time with banana and pear, while the spices form a backdrop that shifts from peppery to herbal. The finish is a rush of candi sugar sweetness mingled with the citrus and pear. The only fault I can find with the flavor profile is that the carbonation intrudes upon it overmuch.  M: Very sharply carbonated, this prickles the tongue mercilessly. It's the only characteristic of this beer I don't particularly care for.  O: Unibroue does very little I do not care for. This is part of the greater portion of their work that I do enjoy. An amber ale that focuses less on excessive hops and more on bringing out yeast esters and malt sweetness makes for a wonderful beer. It's not their Trois Pistoles or La Terrible, but it doesn't have to be.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Bottle chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured in to a snifter glass.  Pours a very deep mahogany with some haze in color with a thin beige head and settles down to mostly along the sides of the glass. Some thick lacing is seen when sipped but then slides back down to leave spotty areas above the drink line. Lots of sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle. Lots going on with the aroma as there is some sweet caramel malts, spice and yeast. Even more going on with the flavor with some light plum, pear and even banana. Finishes nicely that is actually pretty smooth with just a light sweet dry finish. A great brew but not a 'chugging' type by any means.

Had Bruins, Dubbels, etc, so I felt prepared. This to me was a little too carbonated for my preference. The sweet dominated the spice, such that it seemed to be adjunct ingredients, not malt, that gave the sweet profile. The spices were a good blend, but just could not overcome the sweetness.  There have been a few beers where I seem to veer drastically from the rest of the BA's. Perhaps I need a new bottle shop.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,JamesMN,3.94,Appearance: Dark red and somewhat translucent. Discarded the yeast at the bottom of the bottle. Thin white head of tiny carbonation bubbles.  Aroma: Some tart red grape and a little dryness but sweet overall.  Taste: Tart black cherry skin up front with some signature pear/clove flavor from the lees. A few sips in the flavor rounds out a little more and sweetens. Clean Belgian candi syrup flavor adds a nice balance. Very low bitterness and only present after a bright finish. Lingering tartness and bitterness. The 8%ABV is quite well hidden.  Mouthfeel: Just below medium in body with average carbonation for the style that keeps things light. Great drinkability.  Final Thoughts: Another enjoyable beer by Unibroue. Really glad to see how many of their beers are distributed here and I will be checking out the others in their line-up. The slightly tart flavor mixed with the sweet syrup is a great combination. Would I drink it again? Sure.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,BuckyBeerBeaver,4.39,"Reviewing another beer from that magical factory known as Unibroue, this time Bucky picked up a 6 pack of Maudite from the beer store. Maudite came in a 341 ml brown bottle with a production date of September 20, 2011 printed on the bottle, and was 8.0% alcohol by volume. This beer has been in my cold cellar for nearly 2 years and the usual warning applies for aged Unibroue beers...have your glass at the ready because very shortly after opening, a gusher of foam will come racing up the neck of the bottle. Discovered this the hard way!  Maudite poured a murky brown/amber colour, with plenty of small carbonation bubbles rising through the murkiness. Pouring produced about 1.5"" of long lasting beige coloured foam that eventually faded to a 1/8"" cap that lasted all the way down the glass, leaving some lacing and spotting as it retreated. The beer's aroma was of orange peel, spice and alcohol. Its taste began with orange...a sweeter orange at first which gave way to orange rind, followed by coriander, with a mildly bitter finish. As the beer warms its 8.0% alcohol becomes more noticeable. I would describe Maudite as medium bodied, with a crisp carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. Unibroue rarely seems to miss the mark, and they have another winner here. At $14.95 for a 6 pack, equal to $2.49 per bottle, Maudite is reasonably priced.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,utfiero,4.5,"Color- light leather brown, slightly cloudy. Huge head.  Aroma of pear and honey.  Taste- Another fine offering from Unibroue. Starts with mild notes of pear and roasted malt and hints of caramel, mid body has fine carbonation that slightly dries the flavor, then finishing long and subdued semi-dry with hints of mild hop and raisins. The name translates as ""damned,"" and we concur that never tasting this ale is akin to being damned to beer ignorance. Tasted 6/4/2014. Purchased at Whole Foods North Austin on 4/5/2014 for $6.06/bottle.

Strong flavor with a tart edge but no excessive bitterness. Mouthfeel is effervescent with ample CO2 and a clean finish. Overall, a crisp, delicious belgian dark ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Brenden,4.37,"Though murky and a sort of muddy brown-orange, there's a certain beauty in an almost localized but deep-shining brightness, like a gem glowing at the bottom of a recently stirred-up river bed. The head, tinged a paler version of the brown-orange the beer itself is, is small and bubbly. It's not a whole lot more than a foam, and a loosely soapy one at that, but it leaves some reasonably good lacing on the glass's walls. The complexity, while brought to completion in the flavor, begins in the aroma though not completely showcased. Bready in the malts with some caramel and dark fruits, the yeast plays out with a whole lot of different but ultimately complementary notes to make the whole. It's somewhat earthy under lots of varied spiciness, like a spice cake that might have had a little rum added. A bit of clove, a cake-like quality to the sweet breadiness, clove and banana notes make for a welcome anticipation. ...and the taste doesn't disappoint. It's the same overall profile and individual factors more fully expressed, with maybe a hint more hops as well as a stronger note to the peppery aspect of the spiciness. Otherwise, the tongue also gets all the thick breads, dark fruits, warming alcohol, earth, caramel, clove and banana, as well as a little more from hints of something almost woody and some pale fruit flesh, even a little tartness underneath it all. There's lots of crispness to the feel of this beer in its medium, almost full but very refreshing body. Never too sweet, it ends up more semi-dry as the tongue makes the effort to feel all the complexity as well as tasting it. It has a bit of smoothness to it with the bite, though it certainly focuses on crisp and more hearty than rich.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,chum_husk,3.98,"355ml bottle from the variety pack  Typical beautiful look that their beers have, but very cloudy. It's red with a luxurious head. Smell is full of fruits from the Belgian yeast (green apple especially), spicy yeast, alcohol and sweet bread malt. The taste is very sweet and silky smooth. The green apple and fruit all slide along with the hops and spice, and the alcohol is nearly imperceptible. Some unfortunate 'dry leaves' here, but mostly enjoyable. Perfect amount of carbonation (lower than your average belgian), creamy and equal parts juicy and drying  Top-tier bier, but the Westmalle Trappist Dubbel makes this look like Bud Lite",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Poured a nice soft caramel with a full fluffy head that dissipated slowly and had some lacing. Spice jumps out in the smell, there is dark fruit, bread and plenty of that belgian yeast smell also. Taste follows the smell with some clove in there that I had not noticed in smell. Just a hint of hop bitter on finish. Rather thin but pretty smooth.

The taste follows the nose beautifully, with more ripe red fruits and yeast. The alcohol is actually non-detectable.

Definitely smells boozy, bracing the nostrils like a fresh sea breeze. Malt, and perhaps a little Christmas pudding.  T – The aforementioned dark fruit lurks under the top-layer of malted biscuits. Hints of booze-soaked plums. Crisp, refreshing, savoury and a little sweet.  M – Feels pretty bubbly in the mouth. Slight chewiness. Medium-bodied. Would have favoured a little more weightiness.  O – It’s a good beer to be sure but it left me feeling slightly ambivalent, particularly when comparing it to their other offerings like Don de Dieu and Fin du Monde.

22,33,minterro,4.09,"Bought as part of a two pack: Maudite (the damned) with Eau Benite (holy water) for 10 bucks before tax... pretty good deal if you ask me. Also I guess you can't really find Eau Benite outside of this package so I was interested. Poured into a tulip glass and paired with popcorn. No bottling date, but they offer a drink by 08-02-15 suggestion.  A&S: When first poured the aroma is predominantly malty, with a background of fruity yeast (mostly green grapes). As it warms a surprisingly large amount of new aromas open up including: oranges, prunes, and pear tartness. The beer is a lively, but murky chestnut color. Thin ring of white bubbly head, which goes extinct after some time.  T&M: Not as malty as I would have thought from the aroma. Similar to the aroma as far a white wine grape tone, but also includes tropical fruits, apple cider, Even though 8% is on the low side of this style, i appreciate the craft of hiding the alcohol that is in this brew. Malty, caramel backbone. Mild hop bitterness in the finish complemented by some peppery spiciness (which is also present throughout but not as much so). Well carbonated, but not overdone, light but not entirely un-smooth, a bit oily.  Overall: I felt like it didn't entirely fit the style of beer (not as much epic taste and high alcohol tones as I expected), however I still really enjoyed it. I wouldn't probably buy again because this and La Fin Du Monde usually run about the same price and I prefer La Fin. Still not a bad beer to check off your list.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Appearance: Murky Ochre with a thin offwhite head, good lacing.  Aroma: powerful Belgian yeast, sugar and spices, toe curling.  Mouthfeel: smooth glycerine. awesome..  Taste: Plums, cloves, a touch of band aid. Dark fruity, Dry, spicy, molasses, a jumble of flavors explode in the mouth.  Notes: I cannot believe I only paid $ 9.99 for 4 bottles of this masterpiece. This beer is beyond great, it is a stunning beer that could stand up to any Trappist or other Belgian made beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BethanyB,4.27,"Appearance: Medium brown and hazy, with a thin, flat white head. Not the prettiest beer in the world. The haze is okay for the style, but the poor excuse for a head is not. Could be due to big alcohol content or a dirty bar glass...  Smell: Smokey, with tons of spice: cloves, coriander, nutmeg, and cinnamon are swirled with yeasty, bready malt. A dash of booze and dark fruit extract floats in the background. A unique bouquet indeed, it reminds me of a dark Belgian ale mixed with a holiday ale.  Taste: More citrusy flavored than expected, as citrus is unusual for the style and was not detected in the scent. The strong spices on the nose definitely come through on the tongue, as does the yeasty bread taste, which mixes evenly with a sweet tangerine flavor in the finish. Darker fruit is detected as the beer warms, and even later, some minty hops and chocolate malt can be tasted, creating a bit of a thin mint flavor combo. This beer is full of surprises and grows in complexity. There is a lot going on here, but the flavors mix together quite nicely, reinforcing the winter ale meets dark Belgian ale concept noted in the smell.  Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel and very high carbonation. Alcohol warming is present, but not overwhelming. A slightly dry finish is most likely a product of the snappy carbonation. Perfect for the style.  Overall: Definitely something I would order again and again. It's not quite one of those flawless gems that has that magical je ne sais quois about it, but it is undeniably delicious, interesting, and made with thoughtful creativity.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,DaveBar,4.27,Excellent offering from Unibroue once again. 12oz bottle into a large bodied wine glass  A- Opened with a mighty snap and poured with a tremendous amount of carbonation. Nice dark yellow/amber colour  S- Touch of citrus fruit. Heavy tones in the nose.  T- Excellent! Enjoyable and light on the palate without any hint of the 8% alcohol. Opens well revealing spicy notes with a not quite Belgium taste but more a cross or hybrid. Leaving a few in cellar to see how if the bite that Maudite has fresh subsides.  M- Creamy good! Light at first but quickly turns to a touch bitter than reveals all if it's characters above  O- Excellent! For $47.00 the 24- 12oz bottle investment is well worth it. Not a daily drinker.  Food Pairing  Being a self proclaimed foodie I will provide matches for all my reviews based upon my experiences. Take with a grain of salt however I rarely receive complaints for my culinary skills!  Food Pairing  This beer will match well with... Chicken Supreme.  With Cilantro and Tarragon Chicken Supreme will match very well with Maudite's spicy background.  Enjoy!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MaximalC,4.08,"Pours a murky bronze color akin to dirty pond water with a modest khaki head that settles into a layer of fine froth. Aroma smells of apple, pear, coriander, and a hint of caramel sweetness. The flavor tastes much like it smells--caramelly sweet with vibrant coriander and clove bolstered by Belgian yeast. The mouthfeel is positively sizzling yet velvety on account of the spice, yeast, and carbonation. Traces of fruit manage to emerge on the back end. The 8% ABV is marvelously well concealed. The only fault I can proffer is that the sweetness can become slightly cloying with time. The body is medium and perfectly appropriate for the style.  Overall, this is a flavorful and effervescent Belgian ale that's equally at home on a hot summer's day and a cold winter's night. I almost take these Unibroue beers for granted on account of their consistent quality, but let there be no doubt that this is a great Belgian ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

M: Smooth classic Belgian feel, fine carbonation, and a long lingering finish. O: This was quite a treat and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Belgian style ale. I drank it slowly and savored every drop. The alcohol is on the high side and you can taste it through the whole sip. However, it never overpowers the rest of the beer and adds a nice warmth to the experience. This was a very satisfying beer. Do not drink it too cold as you can't fully appreciate the complex flavors.  P.S. As I drank this beer, it warmed up to room temperature and I noticed a very nice and light honey flavor.

22,33,1sophrosyne1,4.19,"Drunk from a tulip glass over a fine half hour. The appearance is of a hazy orange brick color, with a small tan head (it retains and leaves the top fully covered, though), and some sudsy lacing. It smells of bubble gum, orange, nutmeg, cherry, a little hemp, hay, and spruce. Mild phenolics and yeast ride along. A bold taste profile--there's orange, cherry, currants, apple, and tart spice with a metallic edge. Even with brown sugar and spice, it never feels very heavy, and ends in a nice balance of sweet and bitter depth. Lively carbonation, somewhat chewy--where hay comes through late in each sip. As with the flavors, the body is lighter than expected based on style and alcohol content. Similar to Chimay Blue in many (positive) regards. Fine stuff. I'd certainly go back for more and would like to try it on tap, as I'd expect the air would soften some of the sweet notes and let it dance a more spicy, devilish jig fitting with its name.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smell is huge on dark fruit...raisins, figs, dates, etc. Taste holds true and is truly an exceptional beer.

Overall one of the best and i highly recommend it!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,LambicPentameter,4.21,"Enjoyed out of a 12 oz brown bottle with foil around the neck and cap and a code that looks like it could be used to decipher the bottling date but I'm too lazy to do it. No matter, as this beer should hold up fine and I trust the restaurant I ordered it from not to serve out-of-date beer. Poured into a Boulevard Smokestack Series tulip glass.  Appearance - I'm enchanted by the color of this beer. A deep garnet-ruby red where the light comes through, but otherwise a deep chestnut dark brown. A bit of cloudiness from the bottom of the bottle yeast. Atop the body sits a finger-thick head of faint tan with a brown sugar tint to it. Retention is excellent, fading into a nice film across the surface of the beer and leaving moderate lacing.  Smell - Faint notes of dark and light fruit, with yeasty phenols resembling the banana and clove notes you'll get from a hefeweizen. Along with the aromatic spiciness and the darker malts, this one gives me a little bit of a dunkelwezien feel to it, but with more complexity.  Taste - The dark fruits are now more aggressive, with fig, date, currant and some light notes of raisin. The phenols are still here, but in a more subdued role than in the aroma, which is good. Now I get some more distinct characteristics from the spiciness--allspice and clove, with perhaps some caramelized brown sugar and faint molasses. Yet in spite of all the complex and rich flavors, this beer retains a lightness that I don't usually associate with BSDAs.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied, but with a surprisingly light touch, as noted previously. Ample carbonation and a semisweet finish.  Overall, this may be one of my favorite in the style. A bit lighter in color and more delicate in feel than many, but one that certainly sets itself apart from the pack in a unique way. It goes to show why so many breweries will often have multiple takes on this style--because there is a lot of room for creativity.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

T: Dark fruits, a big apple character, chocolate, caramel, lots of spice, a bit of banana.  M/D: Full bodied, very heavy carbonation but yet still very drinkable.

Huge carbonation coming up the sides of the glass, typical of Belgian styles.  Smell: Smells like banana with a little bit of booze coming though. Smells a little maltier than a hefeweizen, but that same banana smell is detectable.  Taste: An incredibly complex taste, just like the other Unibroue offerings. Strong hints of banana play nicely with hints of caramel malty sweetness. Not quite the same sort of dark fruit presence as a Weizenbock, but the plum/date/caramel flavor from the malt is certainly there, if but barely. Alcohol masked perfectly.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth due to the high carbonation, but small bubbles. Really gives this beer some body.  Overall: A fantastic brew and one I would certainly buy again. Worth sharing in terms of larger format bottles, and would likely pair nicely with nicer meat dishes (steak, pork chops).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CalgaryFMC,4.56,"A dark brown with orange highlights, this world class Belgian style dark generally yields a small amount of light butterscotch colored head and releases a complex aroma of sweet malt, molasses, citrus, spicy esters, and the faintest whiff of aromatic alcohols. The palate is deep dark complexity that somehow manages to make the aroma seem tame. I get molasses, chocolate brownie, a bouquet of spices including lemony coriander, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon, sour curry, dried dark fruits (raisin and prune), some overripe cherry notes, and some green hop flavors that appear after a few sips. Finish is sweet and rich, you will get tipsy if not careful as the alcohol is almost undetectable (had a bottle mid-afternoon for the purpose of writing this review and should have eaten more beforehand). In my view this is among the best beers in the world and is quite easy to track down here in the West.

I smell a little caramel, some molasses and a strong note of sour apples. Belgian yeast is also prominent with some spices, nutmeg being notably prominent.  Sour apple and plum mix together on the tongue. Molasses is also noted with nutmeg and clove helping out. As it warms I notice the alcohol a little more.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied.

Also a light amount of malt and fruity hops, probably about equal in strength. Just a touch of booze. Nice smelling beer.  T - A good tasting beer that deserves it's acclaim. I'm not a huge fan of Belgian style ale's, but I'd say this might be the best I've ever sampled. Very fruity, much like the aroma. Also detected some banana and clove. The malt was noted much more in the taste than in the aroma. Just a hint of booze in the aftertaste. Also some hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Great beer.  F - Dangerous. 8% ABV and incredibly easy to drink. Very refreshing and easy on the throat and stomach. Again, dangerous!  O - As I said, I'm really not a huge fan of Belgian ale's, so perhaps I'm a bit biased. But I will say, this is probably the best tasting of any Belgian ale style I've ever sampled.

Cherries, raisins, prunes, vanilla, brandy, and Christmas cookie dough. Goood stuff.  The taste is a smooth, harmonious blend of everything in the aroma, with a bit more of the fruitiness coming in.

T: Amazing.Dark pitted fruits come through. Prunes and apricot are made very present. The malty character of the beer is also nice and is rather sweet and slightly caramel like in complexion. A brown sugar flavor is also present on the end of the sip and ties the beer together nicely. Unibroues signature yeast is also there and is most likely responsible for the clove and spicy phenolics that are so well done.  M: Very bubbly and palate cleansing which makes the beer more filling than what would normally be expected. A firm and nicely build body support the beer.  O: Just a fucking great beer.

A 3-pack of Maudite, Trois Pistoles, and La Fin Du Monde 750ml all for $16.99. The price makes it taste even better. On to the review....  Poured this into it's very own Maudite snifter. Poured an eerie super murky dark amber red with tons of very active carbonation. When held to the light it looked like the fires of Hell...Thick creamy white head that stayed put the entire drink. Left thin micro bubbled lacing with each drink.  The smell is very complex. Malt on top of malt. Caramel, bread, dough. I'm even getting vanilla. The spiciness is there from the yeast. A big deep smell even gives a hint of pepper. It's taken over by the malts though.  Now for the taste. Very complex here as well. Malts up front. Doughiness. Starts with a doughy sweetness quickly followed by the spice. There are dark fruits toward the end, plum and something else that I can't place. Very good  Mouthfeel is lively. A tingle on my lips and from mid tongue down through my throat from the carbonation.Medium bodied. Coats my tongue as I drink. A slight alcohol heat in the back of my throat and in my nose.  Drinkability is very high considering the complexity and alcohol. I had to slow myself down cause I wanted to drink it to fast. It would be an easy one to sip on all night though.  Overall Maudite is an exceptional beer. everything about it is very high quality. I try and have these in my fridge often and always try and cellar a couple but I want to drink them too badly and never get around to it. If you've never drank this before pick it up.

Belgian candi sugar, tart peaches, pear, and sharp citrus form the initial aroma. There's an earthy, musty character beneath a yeasty profile.  Flavor reveals a dominant of pear throughout, with sweet, lightly toasted malt forming the backbone, and notes of brown sugar that hit mid palate, carrying into a slightly dry, spicy finish. Plums, dates, and raisins are subtle.  Body is creamy and moderately full, with high carbonation to lighten up the feel, and a kick of alcohol warmth.  Less complex than some. The pear character masks subtle nuances that would improve the overall experience. It's pretty hot, too. And the carbonation could be dialed down a bit.

22,33,falloutsnow,3.93,"From: Brix, Omaha, NE Date: Best by 2013-08-03 (aged two years) Glass: New Belgium globe glass  Unibroue's Maudite is a very good strong Belgian amber ale, with complex flavors of bread, toffee, dried fruits and spices. This is a Belgian ale that is light enough in flavor to fit during warm weather, but substantial enough to be enjoyed in cooler times as well.  Pours a 2cm tall head of beige-colored foam, which fades in about one minute, about average, to a thin ring around the perimeter of the glass along with a small island of foam atop the body of the beer. Lacing is present, though not particularly substantial, a few moderately-sized blotches cling to the sides of the glass. The body is a dark golden brown color, with light bringing out bright copper hues in the transparent body. Carbonation is readily visible, traveling up the sides and center of the glass in numerous and active streams.  Aroma of light toffee and candied apple, pear, dates, and figs, with slight minerals and leather in the background.  Overall, complex Belgian yeast esters and phenols contributing fruits (dried dates and figs) and spices (nutmeg, clove, anise), with characters of golden-toasted bread and light toffee provided by malts. Front of palate discovers toasted bread crusts, light buttery toffee, trace dried orange peel with cloves and nutmeg, and faint dried dates and figs. Mid-palate is of stronger toasted bread crusts, light buttery toffee, mild dried dates and figs, dried orange peel, spices such as mild cloves and nutmeg, with slight fine liquor and mineral qualities. Back of palate finds bread crusts and light toffee, candied apple and pear, hints of dried dates and figs, faint dried orange peel, and spicy phenols. Aftertaste of toasted bread and mild toffee, faint nutmeg and cloves, anise and faint ethanol.  Beer is medium bodied, with medium-high levels of carbonation, resulting in a fizzy, then mostly smooth and foamy mouthfeel that goes well with the beer's level of heaviness and ethanol. Ethanol is excellently concealed, only a slight trace noted in the nostrils when swallowing. Closes semi-dry, with little stickiness remaining on the palate after each sip.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,JasonSandeman,4.19,"I saw the legend of this beer on the Unibroue website, and like anything with a good story, I was intrigued. Watch it for yourself here.  I bought a six pack for our poker game last Friday, and wasn’t disappointed. I made a point to serve it in a beer glass, but I feel serving it in a brandy glass at 8°C would give the experience the brewers were looking for.  [TASTING NOTES]  Appearance – When I poured the beer, it gave a great head immediately. The beer was a murky dark orange color, almost yellow. The head disappeared quickly but didn’t leave much lace on the glass. (Lace is what you call the lacy white ring that remains on the glass after the head dissipates)  Smell – Crisp, sweet. A heady smell of hops and wheat.  Taste – I tasted caramel laced with spices such as cardamom, coriander, ginger. The beer is heavy on the hops which give a spruce flavor. Definitely not for the faint.  Mouthfeel – The beer was creamy, yet crisp on the tongue. The flavor of the hops lingered in the background.  Overall Score – 8/10. This beer has a bold hop and spruce flavor that will be a turnoff to the average beer drinker. If it had a bit more lace the beer would hit a nine on the scale. Serve with: This beer would go great with Cendre de Lune goat cheese, a grilled T-bone steak in the fall, or even paired with a sweet apple pie during apple picking season.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S: A mix of malt and some warm spices. Occasional sniffs get an unfortunate metallic aroma, but Unibroue once again creates an intriguing and delicious spice potpourri that can overcome any flaws.  T: The spices take the forefront; I’m getting warm stuff like cinnamon, clove, ginger, even a bit of heated spice, such as pepper. Like a great cigar without the harshness of the smoke. Even displays a caramel flavor on my last sip. A flaw, however, is present again; the middle and beginning of the finish has a decidedly unpleasant chalky biscuit flavor, and something almost medicinal. I know some people will still enjoy this flavor, but I’m not one of them.  M: Velvety, with some carbonation bite on the back of my tongue.  O: A beer with great depth and complexity, and really an ingenious mixture of components for all the senses, unfortunately not all of its aspects suit me well. I can accept what I perceive as drawbacks to be balancing components, but I think I might prefer a more straightforwardly spiced beer. Some will love it, all should respect it.

That could explain the lack of bitterness. The first taste is smooth, like a smooth apple or grape juice. That lasts for a moment before the spices kick it. Clove, cinnamon, coriander are ones that came to mind for me. ...4.25....  Mouthfeel - Between sips my mouth thought I was eating a carameled apple. The the spices hit your tongue and wake it back up. Then everything mellows and you are left with this sweet, lingering residual sweetness. ....4.75...  Overal, this is a cool beer. My second from UniBroue. Not as good as La Fin Du Monde, but its almost impossible to match the genius of that beer. This is a beer i'd love to have on a crisp fall day when the leave are changing. 4.5",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Average amount of lacing on the sides of the glass, very good retention all the way down.  Smelled wet malts up front, then got dark Belgian spices, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, caramel, toffee, faint gingerbread and light pepper notes.  Tasted similar to the nose. Got those warm Belgian spices - cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. Also light gingerbread, caramel, toffee and some roasty malts. Cinnamon or nutmeg lingers on the tongue after.  Medium body. Slick-to-thick texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish.  Another good beer by Unibroue. That’s 3-for-3 for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,KYGunner,3.84,"Nice Belgian Strong Ale prototypical color with a plum like redness and darkness. The head was very fizzy with lots of bubbly carbonation rocketing to the top.  The scent is rather fruity with dark fruits such as plum, prune and raison. I got a lot of black licorice, anise and clove towards the end of the nose.  The taste is interesting in that when I took the first sip I said, ""that's interesting."" It's a combination of Trois Pistoles and Fin du Monde. I get the dark fruits as it warms but find the clove a bit overwhelming. The plum and prune move more to the forefront and the clove begins to dissipate. All the while the carbonation leaves a light airy taste and feel.  Overall, this is an interesting melding of two well known Unibroue beers, perhaps not by design or intent, but only by the feel of my palate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dar482,4.49,"Comes in a murkey copper color, a reddish brown. In the light, it has this lovely dark amber color. The head is a small bubbled one finger head that quickly dissipates to a little white ring around the glass.  The aroma has a big bright fruity smack of Belgian yeast and breadiness. It’s not really super dark fruits like a quad, but maybe some dried cherries, raisins dried apple, and clove. A nice aroma on this.  The flavor follows through, but it’s quite surprising. There’s some sour apple, a bright caramel, and toffee. It has this slight bitterness about it that just grows and eventually grips your tongue slightly. Not like a hop bomb IPA, but surprisingly for a Belgian style. It almost reminds me slightly of Duvel, but stronger and richer. It’s quite prominent and refreshing actually. The fruitiness however pushes it towards La Chouffe instead of Duvel. It's still very bready as well.  Like Trois Pistoles, this beer has a wonderful tiny bubbled carbonation and mouthfeel. Almost like a super fizzy champagne.  The finish has almost a metallic taste, which is not really a dig at the beer. It’s not in an offensive manner that makes to beer taste skunked or anything.  It’s quite a complex beer. Extremely drinkable. The fruit, spice, and tinge of bitterness are wonderful.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Tastes sweet up front, then some spices kick in and they add complexity. I am getting something like cinnamon--whatever it is, it's good. The flavors are well-balanced. The sweetness takes the edge off of what would otherwise be an over spiced beer. Excellent.  There's a warmth to this beer, but it isn't as full bodied as I'd prefer. Still, the mouthfeel is better than a lot of beers out there.  This is a good beer or capping off the night, sitting in front of the television watching some show on the old dvr.

Moderate lacing on the glass throughout.  The smell is nutty, fruity, (pears and apples?), caramel and malty all at once.  The taste is caramel, sweet and roasted malts. Nuts and fruit; everything is well balanced. There is just enough hop character on the backend in order to keep this brew from becoming too sweet. The alcohol is very well masked.

Complex with lots of Belgian yeast dominant. Thick fruits and a little spice. The sweet malt in the background comes to the nose like temptation. The hops are revealed on the palate floral and herbal. The malt is especially deep and full. Peaks smoothly with moderate carbonation and devilishly plays tricks in the glass with a slight reddish tint. Not too heavy to enjoy and lightly boozy at 8%. It’s demure but not afraid.

22,33,ElijahRivera,4.63,"I bought this about 3 months ago. The bottle says “best before 04-10-13”. I wasn't purposefully aging it. I just had it sitting around waiting to be reviewed.  A- Pours a very murky dark brown with some red hues. The color is slightly lighter and more translucent than I remember it being. The soapy, billowy head was very quick to show off the active carbonation, and just as quick to die down to a thin, barely present film.  S- I stole a sniff right after I popped the cap, and I have to admit the first thing that came to my mind was “Oh no! I waited too long and let this beer skunk”. Now that I'm smelling it out of the glass, I realize that I am smelling a beautifully sweet and spicy Belgian funk. This definitely reminds me of some of the sour beers of tried much more so than a fresh Maudite does.  T- All of the sweet, malty, spicy, and boozy flavors I've come to expect from a Belgian Strong Dark Ale are there, but now they have an in your face sour emphasis followed by a sharp, tart finish. Then it leaves its bittersweet dark malts on your palate, and its warming 8% ABV on your breath.  M- Medium body with very high carbonation probably caused by the bottle conditioning. I remember the body being fuller and the carbonation being less in a fresh Maudite, but this bottle has effervescent and playful carbonation that really add to the depth and complexity of this beer.  O- I've always liked Maudite, but I'm really loving this beer right now. Maybe the Damned Maudite is just hitting me now, or maybe the short aging this bottle went through is just perfectly compatible with my palate. I'd like to compare a fresh Maudite to an aged one. In any case, I'm going to have to pick this beer up again, and I recommend you do the same since you are still reading this. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Semi-sweet aroma with malts leading the way, with yeastiness and fruit esters just behind in strength.

The last time I had a Belgian style red ale this good was when I was in Belgium. The beer pours smoothly into your tulip ale glass with a substantial head and a bouquet of early sumer floral tones that whet the palate for its imminent arrival. A sip will not last long, as you will want to recharge your tastebuds posthaste and repeatedly. The colour, as you would expect, is on the red side of amber, but not crystal clear, nor too cloudy. As you can probably tell I liked this beer a lot and will search high and low for in on my many road travels.

The Maudite pours from the bottle into a standard pint class with barely a quarter-inch head with no descernible lace. A quick sniff would suggest spring-time fruits complimenting the front-end with no bite at all. The back-end is slightly chewy but pleasant. The color is nothing but gorgeous; golden-brown until the second half when it turns into a brilliant and bright caramel hue.

22,33,THANAT0PSIS,4.42,"Unibroue Maudite  Appearance: Maudite’s head flows out of the bottle before the drinker even pours it. After a display like that, the head is exactly what one would expect: huge (three fingers) and lingering. It is an off-white, and, when it eventually does settle, it is a nice, yet effervescent crust. The beer itself is also extremely effervescent and a very deep amber; this appears to be Unibroue’s take on the dubbel style as La Fin du Monde is to tripel and Trois Pistoles is to quadrupel. It is also quite cloudy and has a small bit of sediment (but that may be the fault of the pour). The lacing is very underwhelming, however, this is a great looking beer.  Aroma: There are lots of banana esters, raisins, some figs, a bit of a fruity and bready yeast, which, of course, comes along with Unibroue’s typical spiciness. Surprisingly, there are also a bit of citrus fruits in the form of apricots, tangerines, peaches, and, though it is not citrus, pear (another classic Unibroue characteristic); presumably, this is mostly from the malts, which also incorporate a nice, sugary sweetness. The alcohol is also quite present. This beer smells like a wonderful cross between the aforementioned two Unibroue beers (La Fin du Monde and Trois Pistoles), which is a bit like what the dubbel style is anyway. There is lots of complexity here, which is a lot to love.  Taste: The banana is strong with this one, basically dominating the flavor from front to back. There is a mild bubblegum character from the yeast, some dark fruit sweetness (raisins, figs, grapes, and plums), notes of pear and the citrus fruits mentioned above, some cola, and just a touch of an earthy hop character to bring it all to a halt and make the drink refreshing. There is a bit of a residual bready and spicy yeast aftertaste, but for the most part it is really quite clean.  Mouthfeel: Maudite is medium-bodied, creamy, nicely (naturally) carbonated, sticky, and extremely refreshing. It definitely does not taste like an 8% ABV beer, apart from the mild warming. There is something wonderful about bottle-conditioned beers, and Unibroue always seems to nail it.  Overall: Does Unibroue do any wrong with their year-round lineup? They do Belgian styles wonderfully, perhaps the best outside of Belgium (though perhaps Ommegang and certainly Allagash could give them a run for their money). They are always very true to style, and Maudite is no different, and the price point cannot be beat next to the Belgian imports. This sampler pack was an excellent decision, and I encourage all those not on the Unibroue love-train to buy it or throw caution to the wind and purchase four four-packs of Maudite, La Fin du Monde, Trois Pistoles, and Don de Dieu. 17.5/20",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,ThisWangsChung,3.66,"12 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: Pours a extremely hazy dark brown color. The head is a two finger offwhite shade with big bubbles. This causes the head to fade away in a semi-rapid fashion - however it still retains one finger of height extremely well.  S: This seems to feature more caramel and toffee than the typical BSDA. Other notes of candied sugar, white grapes, and apple round out the dark malt qualities. I could use a bit more chocolate on the nose, but I can't complain about what I'm getting here.  T: Immediately I notice rich fruit esters, such as cherry, grape, and apple. There don't seem to be any significant dark fruit qualities aside from a touch of raisin in the middle of the flavor profile. Some of the malt flavors pop up near the back end; like I suggested on the nose, it's more caramel and toffee than chocolate (however I do pick up a bit of the latter from time to time). The balance of flavors is solid, and the alcohol is hidden spectacularly given its dry lightness.  M: It feels quite angular on the palate - I expected a bit more initial creaminess to balance the dry finish a bit. That's to say nothing of the strong carbonation, either. It seems to be designed to be very drinkable, and in that regard, it's extremely successful.  O: Okay, it's not my favorite offering from Unibroue - but that's a bit like saying this is the least attractive woman in a group of Miss America finalists. It's still a solid BSDA focused on drinkability over depth. In addendum, this was likely an older bottle; I wonder if this would be sweeter/less dry fresh.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,tectactoe,3.84,"Pours a dark brown and slightly copper-embossed color; murky and borderline swampy with a low-profile, khaki-beige head that settles to a ring fairly quickly. Looks like your typical BSDA, perhaps a little less lively than most but the color and body seems to be pretty much on par.  It reminds me of a dubbel on the nose - but then again, what's really the difference between a dubbel and a BSDA? Lots of Candi sugar with a little sprinkle of brown sugar as well. Dark fruits; plums, grapes, and maybe just a tiny bit of figs. Thick, Belgian yeast is apparent with it's seemingly spiced aroma and little hints of clove and rotten banana.  The yeast is the first thing that my palate pick up on when taking a sip. Bubblegum-like with a dash of clove and some other spice that tastes like something you'd sprinkle on a holiday pie. Candied fruits; mildly sweet and sugary with lots of carbonation that hits the tongue and all sides of the mouth immediately. Plums and raisins that have been soaked in a vat of tamed booze and rolled around in brown sugar. Though I may be overstating the sweetness just a bit, the flavors are there.  Hops are very faint but show a grassy character in the finish leaving your mouth with a hint of bitterness. Fusel alcohol character pops out - something that's not usually expected for a brew that's only 8% ABV, but Belgian strong ales often have a higher alcohol presence on the palate. The yeast goes from the clove-bubblegum style to a harsh dryness in the finish that almost adds a woody and slightly funky taste. Maybe not your typical ""barnyard"" flavors, but there's definitely some kind of funk in the finish. Medium bodied, creamy, with a good snap and crisp, dry finish with lots of carbonation.  Definitely a good BSDA, reminds me quite a bit of a dubbel, not sure what exactly sets this apart and perhaps I'll never know.

Sweet and winey with just great subtle notes of spice, dried berries, and slightly grapey. The thing is though it does not taste strong even though it is an 8%'er. Very smooth in the mouth.

T: Sweet to start with a subtle bit of caramel malt. I get really mild banana and a touch of berries after the first sip. There is a bit of spice, but it's yeast forward. Nothing too overwhelming. This beer, all in all, is sweet from start to finish.  M: Medium bodied beer. There is a good amount of heft after the first sip. It's coating yet smooth. Sweet, fruity, and smooth. Not too coating, just right. I get no alcohol presence in this beer whatsoever.  O: Nice beer. It's a sweet Belgian ale with more malt than fruit. I like it, but I don't see myself buying this again.

The aroma is of spicy, yeasty, fruity, coriander. Taste is of those elements, with sweetness, sugar, pepper, and a shade of alcohol. Mouthfeel is slimy and light to medium. Maudite finishes semi-dry, sweet, and drinkable. Overall, this is a most excellent beer, and I encourage everyone to try it.  RJT",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The taste was much smoother than the smell led on, but nothing stands out. It has a sweetness to it that comes from the malt and you can detect some bits of spices, but none are distinguishable.  Would I buy it again? Probably not...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,StJamesGate,3.95,"Hazy chestnut with loose parchment head. Perfume, chestnuts, a bit of wax and raspberry on the nose. Apple butter on country grain loaf, some mashed pear, hints of vanilla and earthy ginger bread spice hops with some pepper towards the end. Autumn leaf finish and toffee and cardamom linger. Crisp, light to medium, fizzy, slightly clingy.  Sharp, attenuated straight ahead BSDA that develops butterscotch notes as it warms. Hits its marks with precision and cleans up after itself. Begs for food.  Maybe this is an amazing beer. Maybe everything suffers straight after Expedition. Maybe most people due to price or availability just don't get to taste quality BDSAs. Regardless, I don't get the fuss over this solid but not remarkable beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Lemke10,4.3,"This pours a murky, medium brown color with a fizzy, beige head. The aroma is very Belgian smelling with lots of yeast. The taste is smooth, slightly sweet with just the right amount of spice. Rather simple yet it’s not too bold or too weak. Probably one of the best Canadian craft breweries that’s mainstream in the U.S.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,hbonner,4.3,"In the Golidlocks and the Three Bears tale, this one is just right! Looks almost like an amber ale. Smells like a Belgian, smells sweeter than it tastes.

No pronounced banana flavors. Very nice.  Mouthfeel is slick, thin, and soda-like. Lacking in the thick lush feel of a good BSDA  overall enjoyable to drink, but it leaves me wishing for something more.

S: Smells nice, nothing too pungent. Some nice yeasty pear and citrus aromas.  T: Tastes nice, balanced flavor on the whole. It borders on sweet for my taste but isn't overpowering. Super drinkable.  M: Some kind of earthy aromas while drinking with a nice warm mouthfeel.  O: I wasn't sure about this beer at first. I am curmudgeonly in my way and am not a fan of some of their other beers. However, I am surprised at this beer. Not so much for the beer itself but because I really enjoyed it. I would definitely buy it again. It packs a wallop, too.

A- Pours a muddy brown, hazy body with a thick white head that reduces slowly and leaves some lacing.  S- Smells like a hefe, unripe bananas, wheat, and spices.  T- Wheat, cloves, banana with a toffee and chocolate on the aftertaste.  M- Smooth, medium body with low carbonation. Quite an easy drinker.  The bottle says that it's a red ale, but I agree that BA that this is more of a dark Belgian. Another great from an excellent brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,JoeyD,2.69,"Poured into a tall beer glass. The Maudite left a thin off-white head.  A - Looks like a tasty brew should, it's a nice warm brown with slightly copper color when light shines through.  S - A bit metallic. I've never smelled a beer like this. I couldn't pick up on any other smell through that strong metallic tinge.  T - I had to sip this beer quite slowly to allow the flavor to come through. It's delicious if you have the patience to drink it slowly. Some toffee, subtly sweet with a good balance and complexity.  M - Quite disappointed here as the mouthfeel ruined the experience of the beer for me. It's closer to a champagne in mouthfeel than any other beer I've tasted. I am a fan of the Belgian style and thoroughly enjoyed Unibroue's Trois Pistoles, but Maudite has a much higher level of carbonation; so much so that it irritated my esophagus on the way down. A friend who was drinking with me had the same experience. He couldn't even finish the glass I poured for him to taste.  Overall, I'm glad to have tried it, but unfortunately it's just not for me. Based on all of the high ratings I thought it would be something special...and I'm sure it is. I couldn't see having more than one of these in a session. I'm definitely glad that I decided to pick up the single and give it a try before buying the four pack. Fortunately I have other Unibroue's that I can try before I have to pass them up entirely.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,DougT,4.06,"Decanted into a Sam Adams glass, next time I'll get a proper glass. Screw top bottle dataed Best Before 01-24-14.  Appearance a dark, slightly ruddy, murky, red/brown. I left plenty of yeast in the bottle but there is still quite a bit of cloudiness. Put up a good couple finger tan head with lots of body and some lace. Reduced to a thin froth on the top.  Smells of yeast, spices and olives. Bread smell is strong when the heads up but gets more subtle as it dissipates. Then note is primarily green olives and spices.  Taste has more spice to it. Cinnamon and cloves, maybe some coriander. I keep coming back to green olives... Slightly sweet. No hop bitterness to speak of. A very flavorful beer. Not as sweet or as much dark fruit as some other Belgian strongs, but very good. Alcohol is nicely subdued.  Mouthfeel a low-medium body. Mostly hits the front and sides of the tongue. Nicely effervescent. Refreshing and drinkable.  Overall a good Belgian Strong ale, not too sweet with quite a bit of spice. It is very tasty, but this much spice reminds me to enjoy in small doses. 1 or 2 bottles would be my limit.  I would get it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Groomsy,4.25,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A murky crimson body with hints of orange and brown is topped by a thick head of tight white bubbles that dwindle down. Spritzy carbonation is seen jetting from the bottom of the glass, but no real lacing is left behind, which is a disappointment. But overall, it's a very sexy looking beer.  I've never had a Belgian-style dark ale before, so this is my first of the style. On the nose, I'm immediately reminded of fruit, particularly green apples. There are some dark caramel notes in there as well, as well as some bready notes from the yeast, which has some of the same characteristics as a hefeweizen (or so my memory reminds me). There's maybe just a hint of some citrus character in there as well as well as some funky sourness.  The taste is full of the green apple notes as well as some dark fruit, spicy yeast, and some caramel to support it all. I don't perceive any real hop profile in this beer, but it works well for the flavor profile. This is a very complex beer for certain. As it warms, the flavors tend to meld together more. The sweetness tends to emerge more while putting some of the Belgian-style funk and sourness in the background. I'm still reminded of some hefeweizen flavors such as banana and clove - hopefully that's typical for this beer...  The mouthfeel and drinkability make this beer pretty dangerous. The zesty carbonation makes the beer refreshing and crisp, even at 8% ABV. The body is kind of heavy, but it's still pleasing to drink and leaves a dry finish, leaving you wanting to take another sip.  My first Belgian-esque experience has been interesting. I definitely seem some similarities between this and other beers I've had. It's an interesting beer, and while I can't say I would drink it regularly, it's certainly worth a try. Hopefully the rest of the 4-pack will grow on me. Even so, it is a very complex beer that forces you to think.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The head died down quickly to a persistent ring around the perimeter of the glass. Lacing was minimal.  S - awesome! Sweet and yeasty..no hop presence and just a subtle hint of alcohol. The aroma this brew puts off is not very complex or daring but it is just right. I could breathe this in for hours!  T - chimay blue with an ever so slight hint of cinnamon that adds to the warming effect. I'm somewhat new to this style, but its starting to be one I cant ignore any longer. The similarities to Chimay's classic are very noticeable....wondering if all BSDA's taste this way? If they do then I am hooked!  M - carbonation is just right...not too much, not too little. Just enough to compliment the experience without taking away from it.  O - excellent! I had not heard of this beer, but came across their glassware in a second hand shop and started to keep an eye out for Unibroue products in the hopes I might stumble across this beer in my travels. Made a special 35 minute trip to my favorite ""out of the way"" beer store and they just began stocking so I had to try it out. I'll be back for more!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A: Poured a very muddy, ""Yoo-Hoo""-esque color with a bit more rouge mixed in to boot. The head was spritzy and only slightly off-white in color.  S: Man, I remember a time when I used to hate these Unibroue entries, but over the ages, I've grown to appreciate them and even grow fond of their funky yeast strain. About that yeast strain: Almost sour and with a tinge of rotten apple, pear, and orange. It teeters on the verge of being putrid, but it actually works. Along with an added cocoa component, the nose on this one embodies that.  T: Remarkably refreshing on the finish and it almost has more in common with champagne than beer. The funk of the yeast strain wasn't as prevalent on the taste as the nose, and neither was the chocolate.  M: Spritzy and remarkably chamapagne-like and this one deserves every stitch of its ""5"" rating I'm giving it in this category. Just enough bitterness to be dangerous, BARELY enough sweetness, and oh that delectable carbonation bill!  O: This one was even better than I remember it. Worthy of a very high recommendation!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,takemetothelion,4.2,"Picked up a bottle while visiting New Brunswick. The government liquor store had a god awful craft beer selection with little to no Belgian styles not to mention awful canadian alcohol prices. For that reason I was inclined to focus my attention to the two unibroues, la fin du monde and maudite. The price was cheap because it was a domestic only $5 as opposed to $10ish back stateside for the pint and a half. So i raced home, poured her into a tulip and let the games begin.  A- light caramel brown, very cloudy with almost no light coming through, as if I were deep in an amber ocean looking up at the sun. A bubbly foamy head about 2.5 fingers thick immediately says hello. Although I was only able to get a few quick tastes of this moderate to highly carbonated hat before she vanished. No lacing on this one as I made my way to the bottom of the glass.  S- The nose was great. Obviously belgian yeast with spices, banana, and other fruits hitting a home run in your face. A bit tart which makes me suspicious and hopeful for a sour ale. We shall see.  T- The first taste makes me very happy with my decision. Though lacking that sourness I half expected a fruity, crisp, spicy fountain soaks my taste buds with pleasure. The alcohol is hidden fantastically and before I know it I've finished my first glass and had a smile on my face (8%). Citrus with spices and bread aftertaste. Beautiful.  MF: Full and carbonated. Not a huge fan of high carbonation but the taste really compliments the bubble. Good for sipping or drinking!  Overall: Slam dunk of a beer and will surely be buying again. Very true to the belgian style and though a quite unique undertaking of a brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Morpheus,4.37,"I poured the beer into a tulip glass, to receive a nice high degree of carbonation, but the foam dissipated much faster than expected.  Smell has a very high degree of yeast essence, with a background sour/tart, almost citrus note.  Taste to me was contradictory to the smell -- I expected much more sour flavor -- but there was a slightly bitter (hoppy) , almost sweet feel to the beer. Aftertaste was reminiscent of banana bread with chocolate chips, invoking pleasant memories of granny baking up a storm.  Mouthfeel is always hard for me to describe: No unpleasantness here.  Overall, another excellent brew from Quebec.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Also spices, banana, a dry almost tart character.  Taste is also very yeasty, lots of nuts and spices as well. Subtle toffee and banana in the finish. Not particularly sweet but not as dry as the nose suggested.  Mouthfeel is great, creamy with high carbonation, almost as nice as La Fin du Monde. Super drinkable.

22,33,Grohnke,4.43,"Bright, full bouquet of extraordinary aromas. It's floral and spicy. High fruity esters. Soft phenols. Sharp sweetness. Light alcohol.  Bready malt, light caramel sweetness. Incredible balance between phenols and esters (constant fight of spicy clove, banana and stone fruit). Background of floral and herbal elements. Light hop bitterness, perhaps some of the floral and earthy elements are a result of the hops or the added spices, but its difficult to judge. Alcohol is slightly detected, but the alcohol-spiciness plays well with the other spice components and its warmth is welcomed. All elements play harmoniously together. Complex is an understatement.  Medium body, with a high level of carbonation.  Incredible brew. Mouthfeel allows the beer to drink crisp and refreshing, enough to be enjoyed on a summers day, however its spicy and warming enough to be drunk on a cold winter's night.

Taste is a full maltiness with plummy, earthy characteristics, a clay and mineral-like yeast hang on. Some initial sweetness before more subtle bitterness develops. Mild fruit, roast, and wood notes come to mind bound together with a solid yeasty body. This beer performs on the palate. nothing sticks out to much and it seems very well balanced. Finish is bitter with a dry fruitiness, some lingering mineral and yeast notes.  Mouthfeel is pretty much impeccable, plenty of soft carbonation that is creamy and refreshing. Body is moderate, drinks really nicely and alcohol is not present. Quite pleasing and drinkable. Warms on the way down.  Overall an exceptionally well made ale.

S: I'm getting some kind of spice, reminds me of Christmas. No surprise that Belgian yeast is pretty upfront. A hint of caramel, fruit cake, toffee, clove, raisins.  T: The spice that was so upfront in the nose takes a backseat to the fruit, caramel, and bread flavors. It's still very present just not as powerful as I would have expected from the smell. Finishes with quite a bit of clove. Lots of residual sugars. Just a touch of bitterness.  M: A great creamy texture with the perfect amount of carbonation. Nice crispness on the tongue in the beginning, and finishes semi dry. Feels sticky.  O: A nice fruity sweet and spicy Belgian. Not sure what else to say about this, it was executed flawlessly.

22,33,Braz,3.69,"Pours a dark mahogany color that is very opague and cloudy, like puddle water. An active cream head, thought this beer was going to foam right over my glass as soon as I started pouring. Head dissipates rather quickly leaving very light lacing. Aromatics are savory, also caramel, malt, a subtle leather like smell, raisin, pear and definate alcohol. Taste is quite alcoholic as well which is fine. Very dry, with a cereal flake like flavor. Mostly tart, wouldn't call it sweet and it's certainly not bitter. Body is very gassy and has a high foam volume. Velvety texture and the alcohol is very warming. This isn't quite as good as I'd hoped. It's not terrible but it's missing something, more pronounced flavor perhaps. Not alot of complexity. I find Trois Pistoles to be superior to this offering from Unibroue. This sort of tastes and looks like the yeast sediment got disturbed somehow.

But the spices are what really come through.  Taste: Wow, theres a lot going on here. Dark fruits, spices, and the yeast presence mix well for a truly masterful combination. This beer is scary drinkable at 8% abv, cannot taste an ounce of it. Hard to put this one down.  Mouthfeel: Creamy layers coat the palette. You'd think the spices would stick around but the yeast is what sticks around for the drinker to enjoy.  Overall: So, this beer is amazing. There is nothing not elite about this one.

The Beer is also cloudy similar to a wheat beer which was unusual as this is an Ale.  Smell - Citrus, fruit, and spice flavors came out right away and after it sat for about five minutes I got some malty tones as well.  Taste - Spice and malty tones right away with a hop and citrus finish. This beer tasted surprisingly good for the type of beer I thought it would be. Very smooth and enjoyable.  Mouthfeel - Has a complex mouth feel as this beer goes creamy then smooth the carbonation gives you that ale finish. Love the mouth on this beer  Overall - Extremely enjoyable beer.

Also note these beers are bottle refermented, so there is sediment on the bottom.  This is not a typical Red ale, so do not buy it expecting it to be similar to your local brewery's Red.

I've never had anything but big big smiles and return orders over and over again!  I'm new to the craft scene, although I've been learning and exploring now for a couple of years. I never drank beer before, and now I am loving it more and more and more. Who knew it could be this amazing.  Although I am still really nice and sweet when somebody just wants a coors light or bud light. We don't serve it at our bar, but I still am kind and guide them to some new flavors.

The head fades leaving a modest level of lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell - The aroma is a blend of fruit, booze, bread and yeast. The strongest are fruit aromas of a red wine grape smell with apple and orange mixed within. With all these aromas is also a spice aroma which goes quite nicely with the bready and yeasty aromas.  Taste – The taste begins bready with some spicy flavors. The brew quickly sweetness as the fruit flavors detected in the nose come to the tongue. It begins with the apple and orange coming to the tongue, with the red grape soon following. The wine like characteristics get stronger. More red grape comes to the tongue and is accompanied by an increase in the alcohol flavor as well. In the end these booze and wine flavors, when mixed with some of the breadiness and spice from the beginning of the taste creates a very warming feel on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is rather average in terms of creaminess and thickness with a carbonation level that is on the slightly higher side. They are quite nice for the style with the carbonation nice for the fruity flavors of the brew.  Overall – A fruity and wine like brew with a good bready and boozy taste.

22,33,Damian,4.24,"Drank from a 1pt. 9.4 fl.oz./750ml bottle purchased at Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA Best before 10-19-14 Served in a tulip  The beer poured a hazy, dark crimson-amber and was topped by a four-finger, fluffy, light tan crop of froth. The head dissipated to a thin film and eventually turned into a lasting ring. Streaks of lacing trickled down the sides of the glass.  The nose was amazingly interesting and unique. I can always spot this beer from a mile away. Super spicy and phenolic. Tons of clove and allspice. Fruity. Strong Belgian yeast notes. After a few minutes, the nose turned incredibly powdery and dry. As the head dissipated, the powdery notes subsided and the spicy and fruity qualities again dominated.  Compared to the nose, the taste was a bit of a letdown. Bready, toasty malts appeared on the front end. Good amount of yeasty, spicy and phenolic notes. Touch of tartness in the center. As the beer moved along the palate, the flavor profile became a bit empty. The beer finished crisp, dry and slightly bitter with a surprising amount of earthy hops.  The mouthfeel was astonishingly light and fluffy on the palate. Once the liquid hit my tongue, it quickly turned into an effervescent fizz.  Maudite has always been one of those beers that I recommend to people who want to delve into the craft beer world. This is a really solid offering available at a remarkably affordable price.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,rickyleepotts,3.12,"I know I have had this beer before… I am just not sure where or when. But I love the label. I was actually surprised to learn that the beer was first brewed in 2007. I figured, looking at the label, this was an old beer that has been bottled for years. I was also glad they explained the meaning behind the name. I had no idea what Maudite means… but the meaning and the story behind the name of the beer is fun! I hope I am OK drinking this. Excited to see what the Maudite tastes like. By the way… I love the foil wrap around the bottle cap. Makes it just feel more expensive! (This bottle was only $2.99.) Bottoms up, people!  In the Glass: I was expecting this beer to be darker in the glass. Of course, looking at the style, it should be a thick, dark brown. Almost like a barleywine. And it has a barleywine appearance in the glass. It seems thick, and has a weak lace. The ABV is pretty high, but if I had to guess, I would have expected it to be higher.  Nose: I am not smelling anything. The tasting notes said ""expect a full nose""… unless by full they mean completely empty! I am shocked that this beer has such a weak aroma. On a second sniff I picked up a slight sweetness toward the end… but that's it. It's cold, but that shouldn't affect the aroma that much.  Flavor: There we go. That's what I'm talking about. Now THAT is a good Belgian strong dark ale. Like I said, we are drinking this cold. But I have enough from my first drink to speak to this beer from here on out. I want this to warm up a little. It's too cold! But the flavor is incredible, and very complex starting with a hint of hops ending with a silky smoothness leading to a sweet aftertaste. There are tons of flavors going on here. I always wonder how they can pack so many flavors into a single bottle of beer.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is boring. But that's OK. I don't want there to be a lot going on here. I want it to coat my throat and leave with a lasting aftertaste. That is exactly what this beer does. It isn't carbonated at all, and almost tastes flat. But then the flavors really kick in just when you think the beer is worthless. The back half of the palate gets the most of the flavor.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste is nice. It is somewhat dry, with a subtle sweetness to it. Exactly what I expected from a Belgian dark strong ale. The beer manager at Total Wine & More likes Belgian beers. Drinking something like this, I can see why!  Unibroue makes a ton of beers, and this is one of their most popular. For being the second beer they released, I am impressed. It's $3 a bottle, so I might not buy this often. But I am pretty impressed with it. The older I get, the more I can appreciate a good Belgian beer. This is a good Belgian beer. Bottoms up, people!  Maudite - The bottle says: ""La MAUDITE (Damned), refermented on yeast bas in the bottle, goes down uncommonly smooth. One taste of this excellent malt beverage will instill you in the highest respect.""",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Almost no lacing, just a speck here and there on the glass. Head has a pinkish tone to it once it has fully receded. Like diluted strawberry milk.  S: Caramel apples. Almost perfectly caramel apples. A touch of melon and maybe some belgian yeast earthiness? But mostly caramel apples. Funny.  T: Apples, pears, raisin and a bit of melon. Very fruity in general but quite dry. Moderate caramel backing it with a bit of sweetness. A little bit of earth and black pepper from the belgian yeast in the finish. Ends fairly drying with some lingering dried fruits and black pepper.  M: Medium bodied, drying. Higher carbonation keeps it lighter.  O: An excellent dry BSDA.

A candy sweetness hits you initially. This beer tastes like some sort of candy I can't put my finger on. It's almost like a sweet toffee or something. I remember reading something about an assertive hop bitternss but that is definitally not the case with this beer. There is a nice buiscuity finish to it following the super sweet candy like start.  M= Well carbonated.  O= This beer was suprisingly good. Nice candy sweet beer. I was not expecting something so tasty from this to tell you the truth.

M: Medium body with medium-heavy carbonation. A good amount of carbonation but the bubbles are soft and tingly.  O: Besides the overflow of head, this beer was incredible.

The beer has the classic Belgian dark ale aroma with those fruity esters that give off smells of apple and pear. I get some sweetness from the malt and those cloves. I don't pick up much booziness in the smell. The taste closely follows the nose. The dark malts, spices, and Belgian yeast deliver the desired flavors here. I get those fruits and the bready and malty sweetness. It is not too cloying in the mouth. The body is medium with lively carbonation.

Grapes and apple skins with burnt caramel and clove. The Belgian yeast strain is front and center. Spicy and phenolic.  On the palate, burnt caramel/toffee lend some sweet overtones. Spicy phenols are bold and steal the show. The phenols give off a band-aid/medicinal notes. Some soft cocoa notes with brown sugar and plums round out the profile.  Medium body, prickly carbonation. The finish is semi-dry with a good amount of spice and a sugary sweetness.  A damn fine BSDA. Easy drinking with layers of flavor and complexity.

22,33,thehyperduck,4.39,"341 mL bottle from TBS; bottled on Feb 15 2012.  Pours an opaque brownish-amber colour, topped with nearly two fingers of frothy, beige-coloured head that fizzles away to a thin cap and collar disappointingly quickly, while leaving little lace behind. The aroma is enticing, with lots of dark malt sweetness and notes of orchard fruit, ripe banana, cloves and lots of (that familiar Unibroue) yeast.  Tastes almost as good as it smells, which is pretty damn good. The profile is complex, with a wide array of yeasty, fruity characteristics - with banana, raisins, dates and plums being the most prominent. These blend nicely with the caramel and gingerbread malt flavours, with candi sugar sweetness being a constant fixture as well. The spiciness is peppery at first, but softens into cloves and allspice toward the finish. Yeasty aftertaste, with more banana and spice. Medium-bodied, with a spritzy feel on the tongue from the fairly robust carbonation. Like many Unibroue beers, this is dangerously easy to drink - and the abv is especially well hidden in this one.  Final Grade: 4.39, a resoundingly successful A. Maudite is a wonderfully balanced, absurdly quaffable Belgian-style dark ale that I probably should have picked up a long time ago. Delicious stuff, and it practically qualifies as a bargain at its TBS price. It's hard to find examples of this style around here, so this is a brew that I am glad to have available locally. It's absolutely worth a try for any fan of Belgian beers, and something I will undoubtedly try again in the future.  [Updated April 17 2014]  Another bottle. This is basically the benchmark BSDA in my eyes - there are a few Belgian darks I'd take over this one, but none of them are as affordable, or quaffable for that matter.

Lots of carbonation activity.  S: Some caramel, citrus, chocolate, raisin and fig. A touch of mustiness. Smells like it’s on the sweeter side.  T: Very nice. Mellow..the flavors from the aroma mesh together beautifully. I imagine that a little age has been kind to this one. More plum than raisin...roasted caramel...a little grape.  M: Drinkability is pretty high for a beer with this much going on with it. Drier than I anticipated from the aroma which I like. Alcohol is detectable, but well hidden.

Minutes later, a still-present pinky's worth remains.  S: Malty-sweet, candied sugars, with yeasty breadiness and a touch of lemon zest on the nose.  T: Taste follows the nose. Lemon zest and grassy earth tones are more present on the palate than in the nose. A touch of raisin and fig rises up from underneath, and becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. Bready yeastiness rolls through on the finish, with a touch of an almost-pepper-like spice on the back end completes the picture.  M: Exceptional here. Great carbonation, good creaminess, dry, sour/tart finish.  D/O: An alright offering, but not as ""dark"" as I like my ""belgian darks"" to be.

The carbonation sets off the dark fruits and makes it refreshing while not sacrificing any drinkablity.

22,33,raznug,4,Appearance: This beer pours a hazy amber color and was topped with a solid 1½” of head that dissipated to a fluffy ¼” that sticks around very nicely. Smell: This beer smells like a nice blend of malt and Belgian spices that seem to play well together. Taste: I like the way this beer isn’t dominated by the spices. The taste goes along side the smell with a nice blend of malt and spices that play nicely off of each other and make for a tasty beer. Mouthfeel: This is an easy drinking and medium bodied amber that most beer lovers will enjoy without being over powered by the spices.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,SvenHayden,4.03,"Look: a nice amber orange, with a touch ruby garnet. 2 fingers of foam. Aroma: mostly smells like a wheat. But with some tart, dark fruit, maybe plum. Taste: full bodied, banana-wheat, with latent kick of plum. Spicy belgian yeast. Mouthfeel: surpisingly creamy, fluffy. Summary: Not as intense as it looks. Surprisingly smooth for a dark belgian. Like a Belgian take on a Dunkelweizen. One of the better offerings from Unibroue though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,deebo,3.37,"A-An odd color of burnt orange brown. A finger of white head quickly breaks down into a film. Lots of lively bubbles.  S-Appealing, fruity-prune, raisins, molasses.  T-Lots of yeast and fruity esters, not a ton else going on.  M-Lots of tingly carbonation, some alcohol noticed. Thin bodied a bit of bitter lingering finish.  O-Missing some malt backbone to carry the strong yeasty flavor and the carbonation zing is a bit high for my taste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

It's good, but it's too fruity, too yeasty. I can see why people like this, but I'm not a huge fan.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Goblinmunkey7,2.98,"Thanks to angrybabboon for sharing the bottle.  Appearance: Hazy, dark orange with some copper leanings. Head is fluffy with tight carbonation and dirty-white. Drops to a thin collar in short order.  Smell: Oh Unibroue yeast. You are ridiculous. Loaded with clove pineapple candy and banana extract. Some ripe fruitiness with a grainier fruit undertone. Something like pear or even apricot. Dusting of citrus. Cornbread with a touch of caramel malts. Lightly bready.  Taste: More of the yeast that's on the nose. So much clove and banana candy. Faint citrus hop note. Malts are bready and mildly sweet. Again, I'm reminded of cornbread, if you soaked it in a weird almost Belgian yeast strain. So much clove and weird banana candy. Flavor shows up and disappears in short order. Almost no aftertaste. Some minor clove.  Mouthfeel: Not thin, but not much better Heavy water. Carbonation is on the high side and spreads the flavor around quickly. Clean.  Overall: This was one of the first beers I had after turning 21. Even then it was more surprising than it was delicious. This makes it memorable, but not because I want to drink it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,A_Phrance,4.19,"12 oz bottle  A: When poured very carefully, the beer generated a very large head that quickly dissipated. Very little head stuck around, but there was a continuous stream of carbonation that was very pleasant. Dark brown, cloudy color. Looks kind of like a cider.  S: Interesting spicyness with a fruity smell to complement it. Quite complex.  T: At first sip, I did not like the taste of this brew. It seemed to have an overwhelming spicy taste, heavy with cloves. After a few more sips, it grew on me more and more. By the end of the beer, I really enjoyed the complex flavors. I tasted cloves, sweet fruit (maybe pear?), slight alcohol spicyness and a bit of bitter aftertaste with a tad of sweetness (possibly caramel).  M: This is where this beer really shines for me. Great smoothness. Could drink many of these, though you shouldn't. Very deceptive. Not your usual watery feel.  O: Pretty awesome beer. Not as good as La Fin Du Monde in my opinion, bur still another awesome craft brew from Unibroue. Definitely worth a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smells of spice, fruit, and, of course, Belgian Yeast. Taste is very complex. Lots of fruits and malts. I taste some spices, clove, plum, cherry, and ginger. Incredible taste.

Rich dark fruits, spice notes like green peppercorn, maraschino cherry, faint vanilla, maybe some hints of ginger, mild bitterness in the middle through the finish.  Fizzy mouthfeel, medium bodied.

22,33,stakem,4.03,"12oz bottle into a cervoise. The brew pours a hazed burnt copper with some coloration more towards orange/yellow around the edges. The cap appears 2 fingers strong with a yellowish tan coloration that holds quite well for an 8% brew. As the cap slowly fades, it leaves some small fingers of lacing effect on the glass. A swirl revives a finger and streaming carbonation maintains the cap.  The aroma has suggestions of fruited quality like orange zest/pulp, lemon, apple and pear. A yeasty quality comes out giving a hint of clove-like spiciness with a faint mineral inclusion. Overall, a familiar yet enjoyable smelling brew.  The taste has a bit of peppery spice that blends into yeasty flavors of clove and mild banana/bubblegum. The aftertaste has some fruited quality like melons.. something along the lines of cantaloupe, pear and apple. The alcohol is felt with a mild accenting fruited flavor that draws in quite a bit of warmth for the 8% indicated inclusion. The aftertaste has a bit of toasty caramel grain which is refreshing and enjoyable.  This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. For 8% it is well integrated and only starts to get warming towards the 2nd half of the glass. My favorite take on the style? No probably not but if you havent had it, you need to give it a try. It has a lot going on in it and is something I would most certainly revisit again to pair with food.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Moderate retention and good lacing. Lots of yeast at the bottom of the bottle.  Taste: Lots of yeast character, floral, banana, and a good dose of clove. Good darker malt flavor, a tiny bit worty.

22,33,deadonhisfeet,4.32,"Poured from a bottle into a signature Unibroue Maudite snifter. Pours out a beautiful coppery-red clear color with a nice 2-finger head that dissipates pretty quickly. Lots of fruit on the nose. Getting apples, pears, berries, and a nice yeasty, biscuity smell.  Firm mouthfeel, lively carbonation, and all-around excellent flavor. The first thing I pick up on is the fruitiness from the nose is right on the tip of the palate. After an initial fruity, biscuity sweetness, the flavors recede a bit. It's almost as if they are overcome by the carbonation. Then at mid-palate, some of the fruit comes back, only it's much dryer and champagne-like than before. The beer seems slightly tannic and mouth-drying as you swallow and the dry fruit flavors linger a bit.  This is an excellent beer from an under-appreciated brewer. Fans of abbey-style ales should definitely give it a try. Those who have had it should revisit it from time to time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A bit of sharp citrus and a little bit of darker fruits like figs and plums. A smooth bit of caramel in there. A strange blend of spices and pepper. Complex and blends well but no big stand out flavors.  M- Higher carbonation but it works well for this beer. Goes down easy for an 8% brew that doesnt feel any bit of it. A stinging bit of the fruity yeast aftertaste.  O- This is a solid beer, Not like some belgian strongs I have had. Its certainly complex and interesting and relatively easy to drink.

Rather unremarkable in look, but it's the smell, taste and mouth feel that really sing.  S: Smells of sweet buckwheat (dark) honey with warming spices of cloves, pepper and candied ginger. Some hints of sour cherries, raisins and earthy figs. As the brew warms I keep getting the smell of minerals & fresh oysters. It's not at all fishy - just the sweet mineral smell of the sea.  T: High spice notes of cloves, pepper and ginger. Minimally sweet, less sweet than the smell, more reminiscent of a dry red wine. You'll get some hints of cassis and salmonberry. I find there is some mineral tastes, similar to sparkling water.  M: Medium bodies with active carbonation - you'll feel little pricks of bubbles on the tongue, although the head may have dissipated. Lovely dry mouth feel that is similar to a red wine.  O: Maudite is a fantastic brew that teases the palate with it's sweet and spicy smell and off dry flavour and hints of minerals. Like other great Belgian strong ales this brew will pull a fast one on you by masking the alcohol easily - not that I'm complaining. the more it warms the better I like it - so drink it cool and allow to warm and enjoy the changing scent and taste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,axeman9182,3.99,"750 mL bottle that was allowed to warm some before being poured into my Bruery tulip.  Maudite pours a fairly clear chestnut, with some burnt orange highlights. There's two to three fingers of cream colored foam crowning the beer, but head retention is average and lacing isn't there at all. The nose has lots of fruit present, plum and figs and even some banana. There's also a firm supporting note of clove and pepper. The flavor profile leads off with all those dark fruits and banana from the nose, everything coming across as being a bit more intense than in the nose. The spicy phenols follow, similarly flavorful, but the beer finishe rather abruptly, rather than a graceful exit. The body is light and nicely dried out, and the carbonation, while very active, feels like it has rounded edges, and is fair to describe as creamy. Maudite isn't quite perfect, but it's a very good Belgian Strong Dark Ale from a brewery that's as locked in on Belgian style beers as any on this continent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,BuckeyeSlim,4.51,"12 oz. Bottle poured into a New Belgium snifter.  A – Pours a pale gold into the glass. A thick, rich, dense one-finger head of tight light khaki bubbles sets up quickly and then slowly disappears from underneath, leaving a ring of foam around the edge of the glass. The beer is a deep apricot orange-brown and quite cloudy, with a thick column of carbonation rising through the center.  S – Dark, rich fruits mix with lightly caramelized malts and alcohol. Figs, fruit bread. Hints of sourness, like a Granny smith apple. Very Belgium nose. As it warms, bready yeast fills the glass, along with hints of rich powdered cocoa.  T – Nicely toasted malts mixed with dark dried fruits like raisins. White pepper and cinnamon spices follow. Traces of noble hops come along behind. Very nicely balanced. As it warms, the clove aspect of a traditional German hefeweizen emerges. The 8% ABV is very well hidden, but leaves a warm spot in the tummy during this tasting before dinner.  M – A tad fizzy at first, but then smooth on the tongue. Well-integrated structure and medium body. Finish is surprisingly dry, with echos of the fruit and spices lingering.  O – Clearly a well-made beer brewed with quality ingredients. Quite delicious. The dark fruits and spices suggest it would pair well with a steak au poivre, peppercorn pate, or spicy cigar. It would also make an enjoyable slow-paced nightcap. A solid winner.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The malt and brown sugar elements from the smell are present with some pronounced dried fruit, oak, and a subtle sourness. Some hops in the finish help to clear up the rich malt.  M: Creamy, smooth, with a medium carbonation.  O: This is a great beer. It's full of flavour but still something that I could see drinking a few of.

This is followed by some more berry like fruits, which linger for a while. Some coriander spiciness takes over along with warming alcohol. The finish has a wine like dryness, but with the cherry again.  Mouthfeel. This one is dry throughout giving the bounty of fruits in the taste. The carbonation goes from prickly to smooth.  A lot more dry than other BSDA's that I have had. An enjoyable sipper, but a little too much clove in the yeast for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Also some hints of dark fruit sweetness buried in the smells.  The tastes begin with crisp pale and caramel maltiness blend with a little roasted/toasted almost but not quite chocolate flavor. Spiciness from the yeast in prevalent throughout but never over-powering.  The lightness of the body does a good job to keep the flavors from being overpowering. Mouthfeel is full, yet thanks to the yeast remains light and very drinkable.  Overall one of my favorite Belgian beers that helped me originally fall in love with craft beer. Glad to get a chance to revisit on draft.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Drinkerofales,4.08,"Looks hazy brown with hints of amber and gold in the light. A super fine bubbled head made a large head that stuck to the glass in a full wall, with stellar retention.  Smells of yeast, fruity apple, and a light breadiness.  Taste is similar to the nose, lightly fruity, with a malt middle and a yeasty finish.  Feel is very creamy, easy to drink. Carbonated perfectly, and a nice yeasty tang on the end.  I was surprised by this beer, a warm overall feeling from all aspects made this very good. Texture is my favorite part.

22,33,SLeffler27,3.95,"Maudite is a murky, russet brown with fine yeast in suspension. There is a slight head which is off white and deposits no appreciable lacing. Each swirl, however, deposits a nice film on the Dogfish Head snifter.  Has a subtle aroma of horse blanket with apple juice. Progression is discernible, though lacking the richness found in other offerings from Unibroue.  Fruity and well balanced between sweetness and bitterness. There is some caramel but it is mostly mixed berries, similar to a fruit salad. Spices compliment well. The finish is modest but lingering.  Has a full body with high carbonation that explodes with each sip. Alcohol is as expected. The finish is drying.  While not as powerful as I prefer from this style, Maudite is highly approachable. One could easily add this to a meal or enjoy it on its own merits.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CMUbrew,4.26,"Reviewed from notes  Served in a Maudite snifter  A: There was no head on this when I received it, but this was likely the result of the server's pouring technique. A ring of foam is all that sits on top of the beer. Spotty stickage on the glass. It has a beautiful brown color.  S: I don't pick up a strong smell here. A light fruity smell with a slight presence of spice is what I get.  T: Tastes like it smells. There is a light fruit taste, although I can't pin down any specific fruits. Nice presence of spice, clove and cinnamon. Light hop bitterness. I'm not picking up any alcohol in this. Every element of this flavor works together in balance. Very tasty.  M: Medium-full body. The finish is quite dry, but keeps from being too dry. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the drying finish.  O: Maudite wowed me. Looks great and tastes even better. I'm really looking forward to trying others like it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,grannaniwa,3.2,"Head dissipates quickly on pour. Strong smell of unibroue yeast on nose, along with a lot of dark fruit.  Very dry at entry. Flavor is dominated by the yeast at the end. Very, very carbonated, with very fine bubbles.  I remember liking this more, but it hits some of the same notes as the Ommegang Rare Vos and likewise leaves me feeling flat. I guess this is actually one of my less favored unibroues.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S - Dark fruit, raisins, figs, dates, citrus, pepper, yeast.  T - Dark fruit again, yeast, peppery spiciness. Yeasty, peppery, and apple like at the front, with the spice lingering on. Dark fruits present throughout.  M - Highly carbed, but still a reasonably full body.  O - Pretty much what I expected, which is to say this was a great beer.

22,33,uustal,4.1,"Pours a dark ruby color with a large, off-white head. Spicy aroma... clove, pepper, belgian yeast as well as some sweeter fruity notes. Flavor follows. Good spicy kick leads off the beer, clove, typical spice flavors found in belgians, as well as some cracked pepper and yeasty notes. The spices turns into a sweet, fruity malt. Big pear notes and some apple flavor as well. Nice. Finishes dry with a really bubbly mouthfeel.

Not much lacing but a layer of head stays almost until it's finished.  S. Ripe apricot and almost hints reminiscent to candied orange peel. A unmistakable caramel sent and a yeast presence that is common with all of the fine Unibroue beers.  T: Spice and a nice fruity blend with a slightly bitter alcohol finish, although you wouldn't know it's an 8% ABV unless you where told so. Very consistent taste all the way through. May be too sweet to polish off several in one sitting but a great slow sipper. Very tasty to say the least.  M: Smooth, think with a crisp but quickly fading carbonation level. Very smooth for an 8% brew.  O: Another great brew from Unibroue. Hands down one of Canada's finest. As I mentioned, this is a slow sipper, not something you would want to spoil by pounding down all night long. Great after dinner type brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S - rich fruit and malt M - rich carbonation and thin body T- all the rich fruit and malt elements are there, just not very strong. Tastes dull. Complex but nothing stands out enough to catch my interest. Perhaps the bottle was too old? Served chilled and allowed to warm to ~60 degrees.  O- nose is deceivingly complex. Expected more from the rich color and malt and spice nose. Very restrained and mellow, smooth belgian.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Fairly opaque, visible carbonation. Head flares up after a swirl.  S: Initial smell of belgian yeast and spice. Certainly can pull out orange, banana, alcohol and hops. Quite pleasurable on the nose.  T: Strong belgian yeast flavor up front, followed up by hints of orange, coriander. Can pick up spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, clove and allspice. Other fruits are apple, pear and raisin. Finishes with a crisp alcohol bite.  M: Very carbonated. Almost as bubbly as a champagne. Medium body but what I would consider light for the style. Very easy to drink.  Overall a great beer from an awesome brewery. Good price, wonderful flavor. I'm sure it's only better aged. Will continue to buy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Side note: after swirling this beer around in the goblet I looked down at the covering and it had a perfect spiral etched into it—I’ll be damned.  S: Ripe sweet dark fruits abound. Plums and raisins. A hint of spice—peppery phenols.  T: Sweet and rich dried fruit, caramel malts, a touch of spicy and warming alcohol. I just want more.  M: Dry and sweet with an effervescent tinge.

S: huge blasts of banana and candy sugar. Sticky dark fruit, caramel, orange peel, caramelized sugar. This is Belgian beer imbodied.  T: Candy sugar, banana, spices, some orange peel figgy plum. I didnt expect all of these spices, seems to be allspice, coriander, cinammon, and light nutmeg; all in all that really seems to take this to that next level that American brewers cant seem to find. Alcohol is hidden very well.  M: Nice and sticky, fluffy carbonation, heavier medium/full bodied.  O: I expected this to be solid from what Ive heard and given its from Unibroue, but it blew my expectations away. Really a highlight of the style for me. I could drink this anytime, get some!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BeerDocT,3.67,"Poured into a chilled, wide-mouthed, stemmed glass.  -Appearance 3.5: Poured out a cloudy amber color. Almost gem-like. Head foamed up to an inch and then dissipated to slight white rim all around the inside of the glass.  -Smell 4.0: Wonderful caramel and barley notes with that unmistakable yeasty Belgian goodness.  -Taste 3.5: Dry up front, with a barley taste that is accentuated by the wonderful bouquet. Middle is gone. Nothing there. Finish is lightly sweet. Aftertaste is short and features light notes of barley and caramel. Very good, but slightly disappointing.  -Mouthfeel 4.0: Nice mouthfeel with the expected (and never boring) Belgian bottle carbonation.  -Overall 3.5: This is a good beer and I could see myself drinking several of these in one session. However, this is not a very complex Belgian-style ale. For those of you who like your Belgian-styles to have layer upon layer of flavors and mystery, pass this one up. For everyone else, try it out. Might be the best screw-top beer you'll ever purchase.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Forb,3.93,"Poured from a 12oz bottle thanks to Whole Foods!!  Appearance: Hazy translucence of amber/copper coloring underneath a champagne-like body of carbonation. Creamy lacing is also noticeable.  Smell: Spice is most prevalent with a hint of alcohol and fruit esters creeping through within this malty, demonic brew!  Taste: Spice is the opener and the closer. Not an overwhelming spice though as the quickly supporting roles of dark, tart fruit mingle within the malt foundation and hop balance that carries this so beautifully through. Spice pleasantly lingers after each sip.  Mouthfeel: Definitely a medium body here with the carbonation giving a crisp and almost light element to the structure of this brew.  Overall: Okay, so I had a phase with many of the Belgian beers and although this brew isn't authentically Belgian I'll say it hangs a beautiful medium of not to overly done with the malt/hops balancing out the spices as to not overwhelm in the end. Great job here.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A moderate strength aroma. .  T: A bland malt body with some moderate a candi sguar on the climax. It's simple - without yeast. A bit of cream. Boring but pleasant and enjoyable.

T: This is pretty interesting: the first flavor of the swig is a strong bready malt but then the fruit washes over everything with more apple juice and pear. These are quickly joined by the spice, think cloves and grass with some coriander. The finish circles back to the fruit and ends with a tartness.  M: Fairly thin and very fizzy.

22,33,LiquidAmber,4.28,"Review from notes. Tasted a fresh 2011 bottle and a properly cellared 2009. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip and a Nostradamus flute. Fresh bottle: Pours a dark copper amber. Two finger fine white head constantly renewed by carbonation, looks nice. Aroma of Belgian spicing and light malt and dark and light fruit. Nice flavor of malt, with some estery fruit, dark dark and light. Finishes crisp with caramel and fruit. Body light to medium. The flavor is a bit lighter than I'd expect, but pleasant. Nice flavors and progression. Two year old bottle: Pours a dark copper amber. One finger fine white head fades to an 1/8"" head, constantly renewed by carbonation, looks nice. Aroma of malt, light Belgian spicing and dark and light fruit. Flavors have melded into a mellow malty dark fruit combination. Spices and a light hop kick emerge in the finish. Body is creamier and seems more substantial than the fresh one. Pleasant, but not as nice a flavor progression as the fresh. The finish is not as well integrated and a stands out against the mellow mixture of the start. I prefer the fresh Maudite, but this is nice to drink anyway.

22,33,TempeBeerMan,3.39,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.  A – Cloudy deep amber with a glorious two-finger head of thick foam. Fantastic lacing of minute white bubbles.  S – Belgian yeasts with some fruity esters, but also a bit of metallic astringency. Unexpected.  T – Tastes follows the smell, but with a stronger malt presence than hinted at in the nose. A bevy of tastes here; Belgian yeasts give familiar fruity esters of banana and clove, with some residual sweetness from the malt. Bittering hops kick in toward the end bringing some balance. A slight sour note that I would attribute to the active yeast strain. (Not necessarily a bad thing in this beer) Also a hint of spiciness in the finish. (Coriander?)  M – Fizzy. Medium bodied. Finish lingers on the tongue; the exact opposite of “dry”.  O – This is a quintessential Belgian ale, with all the good and bad that represents. Not a fan of fizzy beers with a slight sourness? This one probably isn’t for you. Love Belgians? This one is probably right up there with the best. I fall somewhere in-between, which is to say that I enjoyed it, but probably would not buy again as traditional Belgians are not one of my favorite styles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Hopfenpeter,4.13,"The beer poured a beautiful, hazy amber and produced a bubbly, beige head, which dissipates very fast an leaves no lacing. The smell is of bread, yeast, dark fruit and malt, but very subtle. The taste is very complex and starts out with a bread feel, yeast and some earthy, nutty flavors. In the middle malt and dark fruits mellow the palette, being finished by a nice subtle alcohol undertone. Very balanced medium bodied beer with lots of carbonation. A world class beer, a must try for the beer advocate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Slightly boozy at the base of the throat. Very mild sour/bitter apple at ultimate finish. Very warming.  As always, Unibroue does not fail to deliver great flavor, complexity and interesting brews.

22,33,Biffster,4.42,"Such a beautiful beer - it pours a deep amber brown with orange copper notes and a very persistent tawny amber head. A touch hazy, but not cloudy. The aroma is intense, complex, and inviting. There is a rich dark malt character in front, with lots of dark ripe fruit notes. It is rich, doughy and bready, with brown sugar and light molasses aromas. There is some spicy pepper phenols blending with stong banana esters. Its also floral, with a roselike nose.  The flavor is invitingly nutty and dry compared to the aroma. There is rich cocoa and sweet dark fruit and dark bread crust at the sip, with a brief candilike but not cloying sweetness that yields quickly to a light but perceptible bitterness. The finish is outstanding - lots of tree nut notes combine with a bitterness and a warming alcoholic drying give way to a fruity bready finish that lingers pleasantly.  The mouthfeel is substantial - strong carbonation counters an almost slick medium full body. A perceptible but not overbearing alcoholic drying helps to counter the body.  What can a beer lover say about this beer that hasnt already been said? Its big, bold, but balanced, rich and smooth. This is a sipper that invites danger. This is a versatile beer with food too. Try it with a fruity dessert (poached pears, fruitcake, bread pudding), or roasted beef, or a fruit and cheese appetizer, just to name a few.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Appearance: Pours a 3-finger head that doesn't rush to settle. Great lace. Golden brown color, like walnut colored ink.  Smell: Ripen, almost sour fruit aroma featured with a bouquet of lavender.  Taste: Like its aroma, a medley of fruit strikes the tip of the tongue. Toasty notes of malts follow up in the back of the palate.  Mouthfeel: Light body with a very smooth and crisp finish.

S: Pretty intensely fruity; apples, grapes touch of citrus fruits, white wine, maybe some cherries or raspberries or darker fruits as well...I'm assuming its the yeast esters. Strong malt presence as well, spices and sweetness.  T: Spices, malts, fruitiness, yeast, apples, pear, apricot emerges as well, touch of coriander, a bit grassy, light pleasant hopping. Finishes with that typical dryness and a flavor I can't put my finger on...  MF: Good medium mouthfeel, good carbonation, light-to-medium spicy dryness. Light bitterness.

22,33,negroobserver,3.85,"C: 4.0 Nice amber color w/ a light cream colored head. Lots of visible carbonation in the glass flowing upwards. The beer has a slight cloudy quality (may be the condensation on the glass or the carbonation). Nice red, pink and orange colored tones in the color.  S: 4.0 Sweet. Smells like a dubbel with spicy and carmel scents.  T: 4.0 Smells sweeter than it tastes. The beer first hits you with a pronounced tingling/bubbly sensation on the tongue, probably caused by the combination of alcohol and the carbonation. This is followed by a spicy and moderately bitter hoppy taste, which is the main attraction. The bitter quality of a beer is a nice surprise, because with the smell, I was almost certain that it would be sweet. The wheat flavor is definitely present and noticable. It finishes with a light bitter aftertaste, which lingers in the mouth for about 20 seconds.  M: 3.5 Strong carbonation (seems to be a trait in all Unibroue brews). Nice body. It's a little watery, but the weight of the beer is definitely noticable.  D: 3.5 Pretty easy to drink.

22,33,hoser,4,My cellar is heavy loaded with this beer and at its price point this beer should be in in everyone's beer cellar. Currently we have bottles as old as 1998 and presently drinking a 2005. In recent years this beer as disappointed me as young bottles are more a kin to spice soup.

Maybe some plums and figs. Some caramel malt to round it out. As it continues to warm it just smells better and better.  T - Follows the nose closely, but with a touch more spice. Simple overall to be honest, and not nearly as complex as I was hoping, but really nice and drinkable. Dark fruits, Belgian yeast, and wheat upfront, with some light floral hops and spices in the finish. No alcohol at all. Simple, but awesome. Lots of fruit as it warms. Cherries, oranges, plums, figs, along with lots of nicely executed spices.  M - Near perfect. Smooth carbonation, excellent body. Not too much spice or bitterness, but it's there.

22,33,Elevator,4.64,"Pour & Aroma: Served in a tulip glass, deep ruby/caramel coloring, about a finger of head. Aroma hits right away - raisins, plums, dark fruits aplenty. Some pears, maybe hints of pineapple. Very bold - very confrontational.  Taste: Rich, invigorating, sharp. Mellow roundness from the cold flavors of those dark fruits washes across the tongue, hitting all parts equally and pleasantly. Aftertaste is subdued, refreshing. Traces of citrus clinging on. Alcohol leaves a nicely warming sensation, wanting more. The alcohol and hop are definitely present but not intrusive: emboldening the remaining flavors to work their magic. Carbonation isn’t overwhelming. As temp rises the alcohol waves “hello,” coming on stronger and making itself well recognized. The reversal of roles in flavor contrasting from initially fruity and less boozy to boozy and less fruity is fairly stark - not that I mind that, but I expected a more gradual transition.  Verdict: I’d compare taking a cold swig of Maudite to taking a bite out of a plump fruit picked from the Delicious Booze Tree. It hits in all the right places, has a strong effective punch, and leaves the drinker with a hearty smile of satisfaction. Out of the park!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,magictacosinus,4.36,"Poured out a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass.  Incredible shade of reddish-brown, first of all.

Contains no head to speak of, yet lots of carbonation and alcohol leggings are present under the thin ring left behind. I don't know about all of you, but I would surely drink a beer this presentable in a heartbeat.  Smells fantastic as well. Despite the initial burst of alcohol on the nose, there are tons of spiced and fruity aromas here! Dried fruits (prunes, apricots, figs), pepper spices, citrus and floral notes, lightly baked malted roastedness, as well huge notes of caramel and brown sugar! Somehow this all balances out really well.  Drinking the beer, on the other hand, is entirely different experience. Far different from any other BSDA I've ever had, really. I rarely find perfection in Belgian-style ales like this (and hell, that's part of the fun), but this beer is truly victorious at being a flavorful, delicious, yet not overwhelming experience. Flavors are very fruity (often times tasting like pears and raspberries), and the brown sugar and caramel is still massive. The yeasty flavor makes things extra tasty and far smoother to drink. There are pepper spices that tingle the lips, and most surprisingly of all, no maltiness to speak of.  Smooth, easy to drink. Alcohol is dangerously non-present. Creamy, thick, and pretty much unlike any BSDA I've ever had, if not most beers.  This is one of the finest beers I've ever had. I'm completely blown away. It's at times like this where beer triumphs all other drinks known to humanity. It's most definitely cursed me under its spell!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,rodney45,4.7,"A: Mohagany color and hazy. Creamy two fingered head and long lasting.  S: Apple and Pear with a citrusy overtone. Belgian yeast comes through more than any other flavor. A touch of toasted barley as well.  T: Plum, fig, apple, clementines and pear, with a sourdough or rye taste. Has a spice dimension of corriander, nutmeg, and maybe cinnamon. I can taste the belgian candied sugar, but not much more in the way grain or malt. Very complex and interwoven flavor profile. Saison and beligium yeast round this beer into a world class example of the style. Slightly sour and not very bitter.  M: Adequately carbonated. Medium body.  O: This is a great beer. Im glad I can appreciate its complexity. Best to let it warm up and enjoy it closer to room temperature to let out the depth of this beer.  First beer ive had from Unibroue, and I have three more lined up. From what ive heard and now tasted, this brewery is a top tier canadian brewery of abbey and belgian style ales. Im excited to see further offerings from them.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Fatehunter,4.06,"Poured into a tulip glass. A rusty brown color, no head.  Rich smelling. Bread, yeast, malty and ripe apricot.  Smooth tasting. Malty sweetness but tempered well. Alcohol heat comes through. Like eating sweetbread.  Bubbly but only moderate carbonation, crisp but still has some chewiness to it.  Great beer no doubt, though it doesn't blow me away.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,PDXHops,4.22,"12 ounce bottle poured, appropriately enough, into a Maudite snifter. Deep hazy amber with a nice thick cap of foam that lasts for a while. Scattered lazy lacing here and there.  Fresh baked bread with apple butter greets the nose. Apple and pear slices sprinkled with brown sugar. Big nose that's inviting to say the least.  Spicy alcohol in the background proves its strength, yet it's not overly sweet. Caramel is more of a background notion, and phenolic, fruity goodness is on full display. Loads of juicy apple and pineapple and peach brandy with a nice yeasty tang in the swallow. Yep, this stuff is delicious. Fluffy carbonation coaxes out tingly spice, a spike of bitterness and some leafy notes. Finishes rather clean with warm lingering alcohol and phenols.  Overall impression: A great BSDA that's readily available and highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,PeerlessMark,4.62,"What amazes me most about this beer is that it is made in large quantities by a Quebec based brewery owned by Sleemans, yet it is every bit a beautiful craft beer. And it can be bought at the Beer Store in a case of 24 for $46.95 making this just under 2 bucks a beer. It's not often you can enjoy a beer this good for that little.  Pours a beautiful medium amber into a Spiegelau tulip glass leaving strong pearly and lacey bubbles after the fine white head dies down. There is a distinct aroma of spice like burnt cinnamon and nutmeg.  Remains effervescent throughout and the spice is the most enjoyable aspect of the beer. The flavour belies the strong 8% ABV. The usual citrus banana flavour of belgian ales is quite mellow and nicely complemented with balanced malts.  As of right now this is my favourite Unibroue ""regular"" beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,SolipsismalCat,4.59,"Poured into a pint glass. Reviewed alongside Unibroue Trois Pistoles.  A: Hazy amber with two-finger, white, fizzy head that lasted a couple of minutes.  S: Sweet malt and dark fruit. Very good.  T: Moderate sweetness and light bitterness. Spice and Belgian yeast.  M: Medium bodied with fizzy carbonation. Smooth and slightly dry.  O: I really like Maudite. Wonderful nose and a very Belgian taste. You can't really taste the alcohol on this one either. I liked this more than the Trois Pistoles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,HopsKeepDroppin,4.67,"Poured from 750ml bottle into my Maudite snifter...  A- Deep cloudy copper color with a small bit of head that recedes back to a thin layer on top.  S- Lots of fruit, almost cherry like when it is colder. As it warms there is wheat and cinnamon.  T- Wheat, cloves, cinnamon, honey, cherries, what am I not tasting. This beer is delicious and shows no trace of the alcohol.  M- Very smooth, a bit creamy but good carbonation all around.  O- I bought the Maudite snifter months ago and just now got around to buying the beer. Should have done it in reverse order. Absolutely delicious beer. Will absolutely buy many times again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Kbogac,4.15,Enjoyed in a chalice. Dark cloudy orange with nice foam that dissolves down to a thick film that lasts throughout the drink. The aroma is malty fruit with some bandanna and cloves. Very nice. The taste is similar to smell. Malty fruit but there is an additional citrus taste. More orangey I would say. Mouthfeel is the expected heavy carbonation. Overall a very good beer.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,allforbetterbeer,4.17,"750 mL caged or corked bottle. Poured into a gaudy Timmermans glass.  Pours cloudy, browned bronze colored body full of mysterious bubbles. The head stays around practically forever.  Smells of an array of malts, from the lighter caramel side to the darker toasted levels of roast. Deep quality caramel and dark sugar are prominent as well. Just a touch of hops.  This beer nails the style. Deep layers of complex malts and caramelized sugars form the body of the flavor, with well integrated accents of Belgian yeast and subtle notes of the remains of hop flavors blended in to complete the complexity of this excellent flavor profile. After more sipping I find that there have been notes of dried fruit along for the ride the whole time but I didn't quite notice them until now. Awesome.  The mouthfeel is almost dry and not very heavy, but also has ample carbonation which contributes to the lighter feel. Overall this is a full bodied beer- maybe 7 on a scale of 1-11.  Conclusion: An excellent and worthy example of a style I don't often try but always enjoy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,exodus1369,4.27,"Nice deep rich brown color Smells of a slight citrus, and very nice malt aroma Taste is a great blend of spice and slight sweetness Mouth feel was a little off of what I was expecting a little lighter then I would have thought but a good finish.

22,33,jayhawk73,3.88,"Pours a dark orangish/amber color w/ a nice one finger off-white head. Good lacing on the side of my snifter glass. Orange highlights when held up to the light. The nose, while not bad, is a little on the light side for me. I get malt, orange, pear, plum, spices, and a hint of caramel. The taste is a little bit better. In addition to the nose profile, the yeast is present in the taste. Like all Unibroue beers, this one isn't quite up to the best from Belgium. It's too dry, and not complex enough in the flavor profile for me personally. Still, it's a solid beer. Feel is medium, with a nice malt backbone and good carbonation. Overall, a good beer- but in a tough style category... you can easily find better. Cheers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,FosterJM,4.17,"981st Review on BA Bottle to Goblet 12 oz  Best by: 7/28/11 Purchased a single bottle from Total Wine, Brea, CA  App- A rustic looking caramel brown with a one finger head that falls to only a small pond layer of bubbles. No cling or lace  Smell- A bit smaller than Trois pistoles on the spice note with more of an oak note. The malts are pleasant with a good red ale note.  Taste- A good spice note on the opening layer. More honey comes a little bit next with a biscuity dough and a balanced slight slight bitter note.  Mouth- Medium bodied with a softer yeast note and a little bit more oak treatment. The bubbles are quite nice with a medium/low carbonation level with some again just like Trois, a berry flavor I can't pick out.  Drink- I've had many a Unibroue beer and I can say I like their dark offerings better. As mentioned with Trois Pistoles yesterday. This is not different just a bit more flavorful due to the oak treatment. The balance of malts, fruit, yeast and bitter is one of my favorites. I'll always come back to Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,KickInTheChalice,4.03,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. Thanks to willseph for bringing this over.  Appearance: The beer itself is a hazy brown sugar brown, with slightly transparent edges and a murky center. A fluffy white cap rests on top. Great retention and some nice spots of lace down the glass.  Smell: A very smooth aroma, with the pieces kind of hard to distinguish. Medium toasted bread, caramel, cinnamon, and a blend of spices all come together nicely to form a nice malty aroma.  Taste: Fairly sweet up front, but the other flavors prevent it from becoming too cloyingly so. Soft caramel and honey blend together with a bready malt up front. Cinnamon, clove, and some general spiciness help the beer toward the end. A bit of booziness comes through at each phase.  Mouthfeel: The beer has a fairly light body for the ABV. The carbonation is moderately full and brings out a creaminess toward the end. Slightly syrupy but dry toward the end, leaving a strange spicy residue on the tongue and lips.  Overall: Like everything that I have had from Unibroue, this is well-crafted. The residue and spice prevent this from joining the top tier of beers, though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,eye2,4.12,A: Dark orange/red in color. Looks fantastic. Looks hearty.  S: Nice spicy smell that is not overpowering (too much).  T: A lot of flavor. Very complex.

22,33,jtierney89,4.3,"Pours a deep copper color with a massive head that fizzes away quickly too a half inch white lace.  The minute I poured it I could smell the booze. Smells more like a fine wine then a beer. Some dates, dark fruits and malts, and hints of caramel.  Extreme balance and smoothness in this beer, its quite good. Big full body with a champaign like fizzyness. Slightly phenolic finish with a tart-like readiness up front (if that makes any sense at all) lots of spice and complexity. Coriander and clove and banana bread flavors are present as well. There's more than this but there's no way I could list them all. They're all so well blended together into a beautiful sip of beer.

22,33,jrenihan,4.05,"Bottled November 3, 2010.  Beer is a medium-hued brown, a bit reddish. A very large frothy white head starts to dissipate quickly, leaving little lacing behind. Head does not disappear entirely but settles into a small remainder.  Smell is yeasty and bready. Mild dark fruit is noticeable, plum, raisin and fig. The fruit scents start to become more pronounced as time passes. Some spice notes are there as well.  Taste follows the nose fairly closely. Malty, dark fruits and some spices- pepper, primarily. There is more fruit in the taste than the nose, with the plum and raisin accompanied by some orange. Not as sweet as many beers of the style.  Beer is incredibly smooth. Very mild carbonation. Lighter than most beers of the style, though still fairly full bodied.  Overall, very nice but not a superstar, in my opinion.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,madeofsteel,4.97,"Picked up a 750ml bottle not too long ago, and I think I wanna try it in my new Duvel tulip. Best by date of 4/06/14.  A - Pours a kind of murky mahogany, with fine foam about 2 1/2 fingers high with nice retentinon. Takes a minute or two to fade, leaving some very nice lacing.  S - Holy crap that's a lot to take in. Spicy, peppercorns, crisp alcohol. Yeasty, fruity, and very warming.  T - Candied fruit. The yeast is pretty obvious, sweet, bready, and kinda spicy near the end, with a mellow bitter finish. Very light hoppiness.  M - Very fine foam gives it a delightful balance between pleasantly fizzy and creamy smooth. Warming alcohol isn't unpleasant, like it can be with other brews.  O - Easily one of the best beers that I have ever had the joy of becoming acquainted with. It's got body, smell, presentation... all of it. It might very well be the nectar of the gods.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S-smells of citrus from the yeast. Also a bit spicy smell in the nose.  T- there are two dominant flavors, a sweetness and a spicyness. The sweetness hits first, spicy through the middle and finishes with a malty/bready taste accompanied by a metallic twang. Aftertaste is of dried fruits.

22,33,BashOnABike,3.93,"Poured into an oversized wine-glass Nov/2011  A - Thin head with good retention, interesting clean lacing. Cloudy, root-beer-like colour.  S - A lot weaker than the other Unibroue strong darks, definitely malty with a candy, alcohol-tinged essence. Licorice, cola, almost vanilla.  T - Again, a little underwhelming, but only due to the high precedence. It tastes much like it smells, but not too sweet.  M - Probably the strong point. Although it has a relatively weak body, the creamy smoothness is just delicious. Carbonation lingers on the tongue 5s after.  D - More drinkable than the other Unibroues barring the fruit ales/lagers, but I wouldn't want more than one. You do feel the alcohol.  O - Another good offering, although not the best.

A good head to start that disappears, and hides in the shadows.  The aromas are a mix of dark Belgian abbey ale and a lighter belgian tripel, with all of its fruity components. Big raisins, but so much more champagne like than any abbey ale I've tried.  The flavors are huge, running the full gamut from dark fruits and nutty fruit cakes to lighter tropical fruit elements and toasty bread. Bready finish.

There's figs and pepper, candi sugar sweetness, and a bit of earthy goodness. It's hard for me to describe the flavours; as soon as I note 1, another pops up.

Aroma- Everything was very faint this time around in the aroma... Strong malts and a slight bit of banana in here. Peppery as well but these all don't seem to be the old Maudite I remember...

22,33,BarryMFBurton,4.47,"Unibroue has quite a respected line-up. I loved La Fin du Monde, so I'm excited to see what they do with the complexity that is the Strong Dark Ale…  A: Thick, Belgian color on this one; a brownish-rust body with a ton of haze. On top is an off-white head, so silky, that moves from two fingers of micro-bubbles to a half-finger of smooth retention. Lacing is minimal.  S: A very inviting mix of dark and light aromas in this nose; plum, raisin, and toffee fills out a lemony peach scent. Fermented, alcoholic fruit syrups abound, as do cedar, clove, vanilla, and yeasty phenols. Good bready backing that’s apparent as the nose fades. Very nice.  T: Strong and fruity – wow. Tart, fruity grape, lemon, and cherry transitions smoothly into a bready caramel. Delicious. I’m loving the bitter showing from the Belgian esters, a little funk, and mild European-style hops; they’re an earthy treat that mix perfectly with the dark syrups. Great alcohol on the end: clovey, spicy, vanilla, and woody. The aftertaste is velvety sweet, with a slight woody dryness; reminds me of Vanilla Coke.  M: Superbly drinkable; it just slides right off the tongue. Thick, chewy, and smooth. The carbonation is so small that it hardly makes an impression.  O: Epic beer – there isn’t anything about it that’s not world-class. An absolute pleasure to drink. Unlike many beers of this style, Maudite is light and refreshing without sacrificing any flavor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Dave128,4.06,"Had on tap at Pint Night at Pazzo's pizza pub. Reviewed from notes. Poured from a pitcher into the complimentary Maudite snifter received at the event.  A - Dark smoky amber and mysterious. The head is bone white with a tint of orange. The head is frothy and rises up a couple fingers with a rigorous pour, but subsides pretty quickly into a pretty thin disc. Suprisingly, the beer doesn't lace that well.  S - Very yeasty aroma. I was kinda put off at first when I smelled it, but then I got the spices and dark fruit as well. I can definitely pick up the alcohol as well.  T - Strong coriander presence. Dark dried fruit like raisins and figs. Alcohol is evident and its warming enhances the rich flavors present. There are other spices present. I particularly keep tasting the clove in the back of my throat after having not taken a sip in a while. Average bitterness in the finish.  M - Medium bodied with low carbonation. Perfect for this style.  O - Pretty darn solid beer. This is one I'd like to have in the dead of winter as it has so many warming qualities through the alcohol and spices.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,UTCengOwl,3.8,"Love Unibroue and I'm a fan of Maudite. However, I was a bigger fan the first time I had it. I popped a big bottle of it for a fantasy football draft I was executing from the office. It was a great draft and a great beer. However, the beer I remember there was spicier and not as heavy on the raisin... a bit more like Chimay Red. I still like this version, but it's not quite up to the same level. I served this from a 12 oz. bottle into a very appropriate Maudite snifter.  The beer pours with a nice, tight tan head. This is even with a gentle pour. The head dissipates decently quickly, but was nice while it lasted. The body itself is a dark, deep, charred orange. It's a good looker, but not great.  The beer has a very raisiny smell. The dark fruit tones are accompanied by some lighter fruit notes (apple) and slight spice in the background. I think I get some cinnamon in there, but it's definitely not the only spice.  The taste is along the lines of the nose, but more pronounced with the cinnamon and apple flavors. Yep, this is definitely brewed with the Unibroue yeast. That stuff is unmistakable.  This is a good beer, but it's a bit tame on the spices and I prefer a slightly different raisin taste from my malt. Most of the scores ranged between 3.5 and 4. This is a solid beer, but it's not as interesting and satisfying as some other dubbels can be. I'd probably rather have a Chimay Red... and I guess that explains why this solid beer won't be getting a score with an A in it from me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The smells are reminiscent of sweet toffee, butterscotch, a little black pepper, and nutmeg. There is a big sweet malt note, as well as spicy and earthy yeast.  This sure is a spicy Belgian! The first tastes I get are sweet toasted malts, and spices that remind me a lot of wintertime cookies. There is also a quite prominent apple and cinnamon flavor on the tail end--just before the dry yeast finish. This beer is full-bodied, and strikes a balance between smooth and carbon dioxide prickliness.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,doopydoogle,4.5,"A- Hazy leather brown with a creamy golden tan head that hangs around for quite a while and leaves a good chunky lacing down the glass.  S -Big malt, like the wort at the Jack Daniel Distillery. Spicy clove, sharp yeast, some banana, fig, raisin, alcohol, butterscotch, toffee, plum and other dark fruits, sweet rolls.  T - Sharp yeast malt up front with a lingering mild funkiness that transforms into a wheat-beer like character with essences of grapeskins and burned caramel. Alcohol is definitely noticeable with minimal bitter shining through. The beer has a sweetness to it but the beer finishes relatively dry with a clean fruity character.  M - Good carbonation, high acidity, and a fairly clean mouthfeel for the style.  O - Quite nice! Has a crisp and zesty character that the style often lacks.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,HopHearted,3.95,"Bottle poured into snifter.  Appearance - Slightly cloudy, definately a burnt umber color.  Smell - Very sweet smell, malt forward, and yeasty. Not as yeasty as some of their other brews but definitely bready smell. It has a note of some Middle Eastern or Indian spices and orange peel.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Very effervescent and carbonated. The spices pick up as it warms a bit, but you get the orange peel at the start and then a clean finish with the hops off the back end. Palate will be cleansed after each sip. Would pair nicely with grilled lamb.  Overall - This is not a bad go to beer for a Belgian strong ale. It can take a bit of getting used to, but it is one of those beers that you can have before, during, or after dinner and it will sit well with anything.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,KMcG,4.42,"A: Thick 1-2 fingers of head, off-white, great retention.  Color is a hazy brown with moderate bubble action.   S: Bready yeast, sweet roasted malt, musky, and pears  T: Yeast, malts and hops are detectable, but the Belgian yeasts dominate the flavor.  The taste is complex. Plums are evident along with molasses.  It's crisp and slightly sour.   M: nicely carbonated, medium Body, refreshing even though there is a boozey quality to this one.    Very nice!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Not sure if it's my favorite from unibroue, but a nice brew nonetheless.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ikantspel,4.73,best buy date of 05-06-13 my birthday two years from now. hopefully this will be something ill want to drink on that day. poured into a Duvel tulip.  color is a wonderful dark oak. 2 finger head and plenty of carbonation bubble creeping their way up. head not as sticky as most unibroue brews.  unfortunately im coming over a cold so my sense of smell aint so great. i can just get hints of dark fruits and spice  yum. this is tasty. taste like it smell only better. dagnabbit the alcohol is not even there. funny to think that this is almost the same alcohol content as steel reserve. this beer is dangerous.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Tschnab,4.2,"On tap at Waterzooi.  A- Dark ruby red, thin head, some lace but not a ton.  S- lots of raisin, brown sugar, some brandy notes.  T- Plenty of winnter fruit, brown sugar, belgian yeast, warming alcohol, subtle juniper, spice at the end. Complex and soft flavored, extremely pleasant.  O- This beer is complex and sophisticated, but extremely approachable and enjoyable to all beer drinkers, experts and beginners alike.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,EricMichael,4.88,"Bottle poured into snifter.  Appearance - Cloudy, red-amber. It really captures the light and looks fiery like one would expect from a beer called ""the damned"". Massive three-finger head at first pour that hung around for a few minutes. This later turned into nice lacing, but as the beer warmed the lacing became extremely light.  Smell - Sweet fruity malts, floral hops and lots of spice. Orange, clove and coriander really come through. Faint yeast, not as prevalent as some of the other Unibroue's.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Starting off on the colder side, the orange is prominent with a yeast/carbonation bite to finish. As it warms, other malt flavors are allowed to bloom. As it reaches optimal drinking temperature, the spices take over along with a light yeast. Coriander and clove. Bitter-sweet and exceptionally crisp & smooth. When you finish a sip, your mouth is clean, ready for another.  Overall - This is one of my favorites. The color draws you in. The flavor and feel really delivers. If I could afford to drink this weekly, I would.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,AdamToomey,3.84,"A: The beer pours a kind of murky brown color with amber hues when held up to the light and a nice thick foamy head with great retention and lacing. Overall, the appearance is probably the weakest aspect of this beer. It simply looks a little too cloudy with the lees yet to be poured in.  S: The aroma of this beer is quite appealing. The Unibroue website notes that the nose is filled with malt, orange and spices and this is right on. In my opinion, the orange is the dominant characteristic with some spices, malt sweetness, and a hint of alcohol following closely after.  T: The taste of this beer resembles the nose: Orange, malts, and a spicy crispness at the finish. In addition, there is the unmistakable Belgian Yeast like qualities with Belgian candied sugar as well as mild raisin qualities. Quite pleasant but not necessarily anything that will blow you away.  M: Very light mouthfeel. This is a very easy beer to drink especially considering the high alcohol content. Definitely a lot of carbonation which is on par with other Belgian style beers.  O: This was my second time having this beer. Upon my first tasting I found it outstanding but after trying other Belgian Dark Ales, namely the Delirium Nocturnum, this beer is merely just a good beer. It is definitely a great introduction to the style, and I would highly suggest pairing it alongside Unibroue's Trois Pistoles in order to fully experience the range of flavors present in the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Huhzubendah,3.86,"The beer is dark brown with ruby and burgundy highlights. The head is an inch thick, and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma offers yeast, pears, alcohol, light spices. The flavor follows suit, with a strong apple / pear presence. Yeast is there, but plays a secondary role. Malt and spices meld nicely with the fruit flavors. Brown sugar and caramels emerge more as the beer warms. The beer warms the throat and chest in the finish, with a delicate alcohol presence. Not in the upper tier of the style, but a good brew nonetheless.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Nerudamann,3.95,"Poured from a bottle into a goblet glass.  Look - dark red in color, maybe a little murky, and with about two fingers' worth of frothy cream-colored foam that dissipates somewhat slowly.  Smell - very spicy, as in like a spice ale, malty, and fruity.  Taste and Mouthfeel - right away I get a sense of the spices again, but it's not overwhelming...just ever present in a sort of musky way. The maltiness is also very obvious, but not overbearing. Feels a lot like a trappist ale. Texture is pretty well-balanced, but leans more on the watery side.  Overall - very interesting in taste, and the taste itself is quite good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,socon67,3.98,"A - Pours orange\amber with a nice thick foam head. Clear, and laces the tulip glass well.  S - Scents of fruit, belgian yeast, and bread. Has a boozy smell as it warms  T - Flavors of cherry and apple are noted. Along with this, the warming finish has a phenol bite that makes this wickedly addictive.  M - Very smooth, feels light, and is so drinkable for a belgian dark.  D - Really impressed with this, and this is another solid showing by Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A: a very cloudy reddish brown. head is bustling and hard to fit in the glass. good retention. lacing isnt as great as i would have hoped.  S: a faint oak aroma mixes with a dark, sweet fruitiness that makes you think of those great belgian trappist beers. maybe a little bit of alcohol and lemon.  T: traditional belgian sweetness. plums, raisins, brown sugar. similar to the nose, a mild but definite oakiness. maybe a little tobacco as well.  M: carbonation is creamy and spot on. medium/full body.

22,33,JayQue,4.2,"I continue to enjoy my run through ""beers of fame"". I poured my Maudite from a 12 oz bottle with gold foil around the neck into a Chimay goblet. Pours a hazy dark orange with a medium size delicately bubbling head. The head fades fast, leaves some lacing on the glass.  Good pronounced aroma. Apples and Pears and Belgian yeast predominate.  Taste is outstanding. Apples and pears, raisins, Belgian yeast, some spices (coriander and black pepper) are all fetured in this beer.  Mouthfeel is rich, some ahcohol presence, mostly warming. Definitely not too much  This beer is easily as good as Belgian varieties. I love Unibroue beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,McNealc31,3.52,"Deep amber color and a big fluffy head that will not give up! Mostly yeast in the nose. Leads to some lightly toasted malt and a bit of a crisp hop kick. Some hints of clove, banana, and citrus in there, too.  Complex, and well balanced, but not very assertive.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Crossmd,4.72,"Served at a restaurant, from a bottle into a Maudite tulip glass- probably about 40 degrees Fahrenheit.  Pours a dark copper/tawny with a 1 finger creme-colored head. Cloudy, minimal lacing around the edges of the glass.  Smell is a deeply layered apples, game, metal (almost a metallic or rust smell), and spices/pepper. Every time I went back to the glass, I got something different. This I found really a testament to its complexity. I eventually just gave up, writing it off largely as it's own beast.  Taste is a rich, lushly opulent and chewy maltiness that bends fruit, spice and game together in the best of ways. A malty structure is supported well by an effervescence that I think would be overzesty anywhere else. Here, it's perfect though.  Overall, a fantastic rich roundness that is expertly crafted. Serve a little warmer than I got it, (50-55 Fahrenheit) maybe with steak, ribs, game, venison, or raisins.  96.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MattyG85,4.3,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Bottle says best by 05-05-13.  Appearance: A hazy brownish amber orange with a very light amount of bubbles around the glass. Decent one finger off white head fades into a patchy layer. Light amount of lacing.  Smell: Aroma is very fruity like apple cider with Belgian yeast and caramel malts. Also has some raisins, plums, orange, clove, and coriander. Light hint of floral hops. Smell is very fruit driven and enticing.  Taste: Strong burst of yeast and cloves up front is followed by a nice mixture of caramel malts and fruits. Apples, raisins, orange, plums, and fig. Has some coriander with hints of pepper and floral hops. Nice combination of dark fruit and citrus flavor.  Mouthfeel: Body feels like the lighter side of medium with a moderate level of carbonation. Very crisp and smooth and at 8.00% I can't feel any alcohol burn at all.  Overall: A very solid dark ale that has an interesting mix of fruit flavors that is balanced well with yeast spice. Feels light but very full flavored.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,AmericanGothic,4.17,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Unibroue tulip.  A: Pours a hazy, medium copper color with one finger of pale tan head. Some retention and lace.  S: Caramel malt, and a subtle something else that is hard to place-- it's mint-- the mint aroma of grade school paste. Interesting.  T: Leads with caramel and some cinanamon, adds a little pear in the middle and the dries slowly on the finish with mint appearing. Alcohol also warms the finish, but stays in its place. Over the course of the glass, a little tart apple joins the flavor profile.  M: Medium mouthfeel, carbonation is pretty lush.  O: This is a tasty beer. A little less intense than others of the style, but thoroughly enjoyable nevertheless. Will definitely buy it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,PintOHops,4.03,"Glass - Tulip  A - A very clouded orange/brown color with lots of tiny beads of C02 running up the glass. It produced a 2-finger head that held pretty well, and it left some nice splotches on my glass.  S - Smells sugary with a Lager yeast like, musty quality to it. I'm picking up prune, plum, hints of toffee and soft bread notes. As it warms I get a bit more toasted bread characteristics.  T - Lots of tart and dry prune and plum notes that can make you pucker a little bit. Musty bread and Belgian yeast notes in the way of clove, spicy quality and soft banana quickly follow. Moderate sweetness that's balanced well with that Belgian yeast flavor and a bit of bitterness on the finish. Alcohol is practically not noticeable. As it warmed it picked up a vinegar quality to it, which I could probably due without.  M - Medium-full bodied with a smooth and almost chewy feel, and soft crispness.  O - Overall I thought this beer was very enjoyable. I would have liked a bit more toffee and nutty flavors that Iv tasted in others of the same style, but that's kinda my preference. Definitely pick it up and give it a try sometime. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The body is a dark, hazy bronze color, hard to see any bubbles.  yeast hits first on the aroma, glove, banana, copper. a little musty with a medley of rich dark fruits, dates, fig, chocolate and toffee as well.  taste is consistent with the aroma. Flavors of date, toffee, chocolate and Belgian yeast mix flawlessly. The body is thick yet intriguingly light and effervescent. A little lingering heat.  Very, very good. There's not much room for improvement here.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S: Yeasty, light fruit. Some raisin and spice. Sweet.  T: Tastes of banana bread and malt. There is a tang of apple/lemon/orange spice as it exists the palate. I really enjoyed the switch at the end. The 8% ABV is just a warming undertone.  M: I love feeling of this one. Perfect amount of carbonation, not too heavy or light. Very clean and crisp.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,2xHops,4.3,"I like to call the color I see in this beer as ""raisin."" I'm not sure if that's apt, but it certainly had a nice look to it. The head is there, but not as lively and foamy that I thought would be present.  It is only until I came online to review this beer that I noticed it had 8% ABV. I'd have to say that the beer is surprisingly pleasant to drink for something that is a bit on the higher end of the ABV scale. The taste was mellow, slightly sweeter than I thought it would be. I thought it reminded me slightly of one of the Chimay beers.  the mouthfeel was just right, without being too malty or too light for me. It was very easy on my palate, and it's something that you can drink easily with a nice dinner.  I think it was very drinkable for something on the strong side. Granted, I think it's my first time drinking anything from Unibroue, and I would be interested in seeing other beers in their lineup.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

(Into a Belgian goblet.)  S - Wow. A strong yeast nose that reminds me of an ale ""in process"" rather than fully finished. Not skunked, not overly hopped, just not pleasant.  T - Something is missing from this strong dark ale... what is it? Oh yes, the STRENGTH! This is a pretty insipid brew for the ABV and the style. There isn;t nay meat on these bones.  M - Light, too light.  Overall, I did not care for this beer. It lacked a lot of things a Belgian beer should have. I can't understand how my evaluation is so far different from the others.

T - Taste is spicy and malty with a hint of apple and other fruits. Good balance. The finish has a bready, yeast flavor that lingers on. All of the flavors here are wonderful.  M - Smooth, crisp, full bodied beer, with high carbonation. The finish is a bit dry, but refreshing.  D - High drinkability. The alcohol is barely noticeable. A fine Belgian dark ale with an exceptional taste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheQuietMan22,4.35,"Appearance: Poured into a tulip. The color is a sexy amber-brown. Two fingers of fluffy, slightly tanned head dissipated to leave a billowy cap.  Smell: Lots of malt, fruit, and spice. Caramel, green apples, orange, dark fruit that I cannot put my finger on, yeast, coriander, and pepper spice. There is a little alcohol, but nothing sinister.  Taste: The mouthfeel is, as the back label says, “uncommonly smooth.” (I don’t know about “uncommonly,” but it is smooth.) The taste is mostly reminiscent of the smell, but the flavors are much more pronounced and very well balanced. Caramel, toffee, green apple, orange, fig, yeast, and coriander; the pepper spice is seemingly nonexistent except for the lingering tingle it leaves on the tongue. There is a little brandy-like alcohol edge, but for the most part the booze is very well masked.  Drinkability: Really good stuff.

T -- Caramel malts backed by a bevy of fruit esters, a spice tone of clove and a hint of herbal notes. Sweet yet bitter enough to be balanced very well.  M -- Medium bodied yet crisp, moderate high carbonation. Short linger, which is pretty hard to pull off with this style.  D -- Very solid brew, worth a pickup and a repeat.

22,33,nokes,4.38,"It's ""Vertical night"" so here we go with two Maudites, one from this spring, and another from 2007 that I've had sitting on a shelf behind a case of wine all this time. Out of sight, out of mind, or at least...easier to keep my hands off of, particular when the beer supply gets short. Cellaring this one has required some willpower.  This beer pours beautifully. Coppery, bubbly, frothy, fills the chalice nicely. Easy to watch, and the lacing reminds you that you used to have *that* much beer in the glass. Sigh.  Smells really good, though much more demure than the Chimay Blue that we tasted immediately before. As it warms, the smells come out to play more (not that it was Coors Light cold to start with, of course). Dark fruits, malt, and green apple. The smells are more obvious in the new beer, more subtle in the older.  Taste is really nice. Green apple and dark fruits again, but less complex than the Chimay Blue. Fewer layers. As it warms, the dark fruits become more promounced, but all the while it manages to stay pretty light and approachable. This is a dangerous beer. The alcohol isn't noticeable at all. The 2007 is much lighter, and the dark fruit flavours fade in favour of more green apple, but they're still there, and they still blend nicely, though differently.  Mouthfeel is lovely. I like the carbonation. Read some reviews here where people thought it was overdone, but nary a problem with these two bottles. Nice balance, and the carbonation keeps things lively without being overpowering. Nice velvety feel. Again, the older beer tastes fresher somehow.  Overall, really really good. I like this beer, and have for a long time. First time reviewing it carefully, and first time trying it vertically over multiple years. It's good both ways. Time tempers the cooked, dark fruit flavours and they become more subtle. Both are yummy...it's worth cellaring these to taste the difference.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Carbonation throughout the entire volume with a generous and fluffy head too. Smell is mild hops balancing sweet malts. Exceptionally clean. Wish there was a bit more yeast character in the nose of this one. Bitter sweet with layers of complexity at the first sip. Wonderful taste in the great tradition of Corsendonk and others. Mouthfeel is perfect. Very energetic, completely alive. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CallMeIschmael,3.09,"I'm a huge fan of this brewery. And I tried this one a few times to make sure I was right in my critique.  That being said, this beer has far too much carbonation. So much so that it almost overpowers that Belgian funk. Almost...not entirely. This beer has some funk to it, some complexity, but all of that is overpowered or minimized by the ridiculous amount of carbonation. I feel like I'm eating pop-rocks when I drink this beer. First beer I didn;t like from this brewery. I won't call it a bad beer, because it isn;t, but it certainly seems to be the black sheep of this brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

T- Some caramel, a little overpowered by the carbonation M- A little heavy on the carbonation, goes down smooth D- Very drinkable. Despite the carbonation it goes down very smooth. O- I was excited for this beer, I may have set my hopes too high. The taste didn't really come off as strong as I had hoped.

22,33,greenmonstah,4.25,"750 mL bottle poured into Ommegang tulip. Best by 8/3/2013  A - Pours a deep copper with brown notes. A finger of tan head.  S - Some belgian yeast and a raisin bread smell. Caramel and a touch of clove as well.  T - Lots more of that yeast and clove flavor come out in the taste. Again, the raisin and bread flavors are also strong, but it is much sharper than the nose suggested. I was expecting something a bit rounder and more mellow. I am pleasantly surprised. This is surprisingly refreshing and easy to drink. That said, the complexity of the flavor should be emphasized. Caramel provides some sweetness, and the raisin taste tends to linger. Delicious!  M - Medium body with plenty of carbonation. A bit sharp due to the carbonation, but as that fades, it rounds out nicely. Perfectly lingering finish. The feel is wonderful. Despite the medium body it drinks easy, like a lighter bodied beer.  O - Overall this beer is quite a treat. Complex flavors that play off one another perfectly joined with an almost ideal mouthfeel.

Aroma of caramel maltiness and bready yeast. I didn't really get the fruity taste that many other people seem to be getting from this. Rather, a clean nuttiness with some subtle spice, cloves and aromatic wood. A little bit flat and woody. But it's still good, and goes extremely good with Oreos, I discovered. Light-medium mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable, though not too distinctive.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheWhiskerReview,4.52,"Pours a hazy reddish-mahogany with a 3-finger off-tan head. Good retention and soapy lace through about half the glass.  The nose is complex and rather vineous with its vanilla creaminess and malty-caramel soaking the fruity esters and phenolic spices- aromas of caramel soaked apples, figs, chocolate, baked pears, cloves, black pepper. The minimal amount of hops add some floral undertones.  The medium-full bodied palate kicks off with a bright carbonation and again with that malty dark caramel vibe joined by mass amounts of boozy alcohol and spicy, herbal phenolic complexities. Many layers here. Hop bitterness is very mild, while the incredibly long finish (many bonus points for that) sees Unibroue offer another wonderful breakfast cereal flavor. Just like the La Fin du Monde smelled a little like Captain Crunch and Crunchberries, the beginning of the finish here joins the chocolate and the grain for a flavor reminiscent of Cocoa Puffs. As the finish dries out, it goes back to the spicy clove and finally offers some lingering mid-tongue resin and a final flavor of aged rum. There's almost too many layers to pick out unless you're really being a nerd about it.  Another winner from Unibroue. Massively complex and a pleasure to drink. As you'd expect from French-speaking brewers, these beers are as wine-like as they come, and I can't wait to pair this beer with just about every rich and succulent Autumn-time recipe.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,tdm168,4.5,"12oz bottle poured into a brandy snifter.  Pours a dark brown with a thin head. Nose is sweet and fruity; apples and grapes. Taste a apples and spice with mild caramel from the malts - delicious. Not heavy for 8%, medium bodied and dangerously refreshing. Definitely one I would have again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ElCommodoro,1.98,"The appearance made it look superbly delicious. It was a rich tawny-red colour with a reddish-white head. It looked like it was going to be teeming with malty goodness. But that's where my enjoyment ended. The smell was sour like a fruity yogurt drink that had gone bad. The taste was more of the same. It was disgustingly yeasty. That sour yeastiness that just isn't OK. It also had some prominent citrus notes, spicy hops, and some clove-like spices. Any malt character was masked by the citrus notes, the hops and the pure yeastiness of the drink. I'm surprised I got it all down.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Some tart plum, apple-core, cherry with a touch of euro-hops and pepper Bit of warmth. Really enjoyable.  M ~ Great balance. Nice and crisp BSDA.  D ~ Will be buying this one again. A lighter-than-usual strong dark. Worth trying.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ianjsullivan,4.3,"ST: 375ml poured into a snifter. The bottle has a fresh by date on the back label.  A: Dark chestnut brown with a bubbly off-white head and ample carbonation. When held to the light the beer is amber and has a clear light.  S: Bread, spice, fruit, and alcohol. The aroma is dominated by bread sweet cake notes.  T: Apple, caramel, and spice (might be clove). Warming alcohol and slight bitterness from hops. The alcohol is well blended, and the beer is balanced.  M: Though it should be heavy, great carbonation keeps it medium-bodied and crisp.  O: Unibroue cannot seem to make a bad beer. Maudite has wonderful flavor, excellent body, and is balanced. The start reminds me of a favorite fall snack: caramel apples. The hops are not very noticeable, but the right amount lends balance. This is truly an excellent beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,AlCaponeJunior,4.18,"Great looking brew, light brown with amber overtones, clear, with a beautiful white head that lasted, never really going away, but slowly dropping to a quarter inch layer of dense whiteness, leaving gobs of sticky lacing.  Nice smell, spicy and yeasty, cloves and pepper, bananas, lots of yeast, good bready malts, mid and light fruits.  Taste is plenty fruity, great apricot and plum flavors come to mind, along with a complex spiciness, pepper and cloves, bananas, bready and biscuit malts finalize a downright lovely beer creation.  Feel is silky, like velvet almost. Carbonation is incredibly smooth and creamy, body is medium and easy drinking, alcohol is non-existent anywhere in the experience. Aftertaste is yeast, cloves and fruits.  Overall it's a tremendous value and a great beer regardless of the price. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,justintcoons,4.83,"A: Pours a clear copper with ruby highlights; 2 fingers of bubbly white head that dissipates slowly. Good lacing and moderate carbonation.  N: Plum, raisin, banana, coriander and barnyard.  T: Ripe plum, raisin and molasses that fades into rich bread, black licorice, banana, a hint of apple and finishes with some lingering phenols and coriander spice.  M: Light bodied, bubbly, clean and smooth.  O: This has just become a new favorite of mine! I don't know why I waited so long to try this. Complex, easy drinking, smooth and refreshing!

Nice orange-brown color where the light shines through near the edges. Spotty lacing.  S: Yeast. chemical and earthy, the yeast is at the forefront here. Some sweet malts, some floral hedges. Don't care for this - too much of the yeast.  T: Yeast and metal. The yeast is as above, vinyl in chemistry for me. The metal is like the flavor of warm stainless steel.  M: Medium to light syrup with high carb. Dry finish. Wish the body was a hint higher with lower carb. Would prefer more resonance on the finish.  O: This beer way to imbalanced with the yeast being soo dominant and makes the beer one-dimensional.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ChugginOil,4.42,"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a Maudite snifter.  Murky brown with hints of ruby. Theres about a fingers worth of a cream colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. Not too much lacing to speak of. The nose is robust and full of candied banana, clove, and some cardamom. The taste is is full of some of those same nuances that are all wrapped up in a flavorful Belgian yeast and spice blanket. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and is pretty damn smooth. A moderate amount of carbonation suits this brew just fine. Overall, nice example for this style and it shows great characteristics in all areas.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ranger7,4.32,"Poured from a bottle into an over-sized wine glass.  A - Cloudy amber color. Surprisingly large white head, which fades slowly, with some retention thanks to carbonation.  S - A little bit of a fruity scent. The best comparison I can make is a strong wheat beer. It smells fantastic.  T - Very similar to the smell. A little sweet and fruity, like a wheat beer, but better. A very nice balanced flavor. Delicious!  M - Smooth, but carbonated. I usually frown upon carbonation, but it really works here.  Summary - This is a fantastic brew. As soon as I took the first sip, I knew I'd love it to the last drop. Maudite is smooth, rich, flavorful, and easy to drink.

We had a great time during a tasting and the day after that we went to the abbey of Saint Sixtus and the Struise guys,  Now this beer. I had some Canadian beers before this bottle and i was surprised how good they were/are. This one is no exeption.  Poured in my Struise glass the beer has a dark amber coloured fluid with a broken white to very lightgrey head. Very nice to start with. The roasted malts job is done very proper.

Rust brown with moderate clarity and a good light murky brown head; average retention that might very well be the chalice's fault and decent lacing. 4/5  Even though poured gently, the aroma is huge on yeast; not off putting per se, but not the very likeable owing to its dominance. Other notes include soft fruit, berry sweetness and toasted malts. 3.5/5  Notes of slightly bitter fruit peel (plums, apples) on the palate with a tannic finish followed by fruity and estery aftertaste.

22,33,Tford,4.62,"A: It’s a cloudy orangey dark brown colour, if that makes sense; it has a white head which dissipates quickly. You can see clusters of yeast cells floating about.  S: It smells like if you were to make bread out of a spicy fruit cocktail, if that makes sense.  T: There seems to be two major flavours in play here, the most obvious is hops. The second one seems to be a combination of fruits and spices; it is a very nice balance.  M: Needs a little more carbonation, but still not bad at all. It feels almost like a stout in terms of texture; very unique for an ale.  O: This is a very good beer, but not quite as good as Trois Pistoles and La Fin Du Monde. None the less, it is still one of the best beers Canada has to offer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,JJBlanche,4.06,"A: Beautiful carmel brown color with a big, fluffy head that recedes to about two fingers. Excellent and surprising clarity, given the style.  S: Right after uncorking, yeast hits first, then phenolics (clove, spiciness, etc). Christmasy, I suppose.  T: Flavor is not terribly assertive, kind of watery, actually. Clove, phenolics. Alcohol well masked. It's good...but not great.  M: Again, a bit watery, but not inappropriate.

I was excited at first when I saw it on tap on my new local Bru Haus so being a big fan of La Fin Du Monde I figured great brewery...good brew. Was pretty disappointed.  A - After the bar maid finally worked out the pour head issue I liked it's appearance. It was medium brown tea like look. She managed to get the head to be nice fluffy white but dissipated rather quickly and left no lacing.  S - Somewhat sweet smelling with caramel, cloves, almost like a trail mix smell...not too bad and left me ready to experience great flavor.  T - Tasted like a caramel flat syrupy coca-cola even though it had carbonation.  M - Thin and underwhelming, with that slimy residual feeling.  D - Disappointed and underwhelmed.

Appearance - Large offwhite head with a thin lighter colored lace on top of that the head. Clear amber body.  Smell - Sweet. Very malty with hints of candied sugar.  Taste - Somewhat alcoholic, but not surprising given the ABV. Slight metallic aftertaste detectable at first, but after a couple sips turns into dry fruit. Let this one breathe for a second, because the first sip right after a pour has a metallic tinge.  Mouthfeel - Light and refreshing. Almost like a tripel. It threw me off that this is called a Belgian Strong Dark. More like a blend between a tripel and dubbel at best. Acidic and alcoholic on the tongue.  Overall Drinkability - Pretty good beer. Started off strong but sort of petered out before the finish line.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Three fingers of fluffy off-white head that fades slowly but leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass.  S - I get hints of raisins and toasted barley. Some spicy estery fruitiness from the Belgian yeast and the higher ABV.  T - Sweet up front and some rich toasty flavors from the dark grains. A tanginess hits the sides of the tongue toward the beginning. Some alcohol bitterness is evident toward the finish along with some zesty citrus notes possibly from the hops.

22,33,SWMeyer4141,4.89,"Upon opening the bottle I smelt the cork and smelt very much like a merlot, very intrigued to try this.  Appearance-Shades of Amber and Brown, carbonation floating up to the top. Foamy and firm 2 finger light brown head leaving some lacing thats dripping down the side of the glass.  Smell-Just like the cork, smells like a red wine; Black pepper, dark fruits, clove, light booziness. However the yeast really comes through as well. This is an extremely inviting aroma, I think I'm going to love this.  Taste-Sweet, candied dark fruits. Some crisp apple and spice as well. Just enough booze coats the mouth to know that you're drinking 8% alcohol. Like to note that it's almost like an apple cider meets a red wine. Very very complex and it's so drinkable and so balanced. This is a very intriguing and impressive brew.  Mouthfeel-Just enough carbonation to cleanse the palate that makes you want to keep picking up the glass for another sip. Medium bodied with light booziness.  Overall-First overall ""5"" I've given. A great experience of flavors, so complex, so drinkable, so refreshing. Great desert beer or pre-dinner beer. Love it.

22,33,TMoney2591,4.25,"Served in a Maudite tulip glass at Beelow's Steakhouse.  During my early birthday steak celebration, this was my beer of choice (a complete shock that stuff like this and Bernardus 12 were even available, and on draft no less!). It pours a cloudy amber-tawny topped by a healthy finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises bready Belgian yeast, figs, black pepper, cardamom, nutmeg, candi sugar, mandarin oranges, clove, light banana, and a touch of red apples. The taste tones things down a bit, focusing on the yeast, the figs, the clove, the pepper, and the nutmeg. A touch of apple-y fruitiness comes through as well, diluted a bit by some red grapes, but this is secondary to everything else. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a feel that longs to be as chewy as it feels it is (if that makes sense...). Overall, a very nice brew, one of my old favorites from my early days as a craft drinker. Still going strong (both the beer and myself).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,GreenJetta912,4.62,"I love it when bottle shops are stupid. I got this beer for a buck because they probably thought it went bad. Bottle dated '09. Drank last night and took some good notes. Brownish, Amber color with tons of carbonation, decent lacing. Good 2-finger head which diminishes to a finger and pretty much stays there.  There are a lot of things going on in the nose here. Wheat, fruit (which it most likely picked up with time), fig, spices, a subtle boozyness accompanied by spices(not potpurri-ish whatsoever like some spice flavors, spice is black peppery, definite belgian yeast.  The middle warms you up for sure. After crisp carbonation sparkles your mouth, that spicy, boozy character from the nose is there. Its sweet and slightly dry. Some apple and other fruit going on. Loaded with flavor and incredibly complex. I taste something new with each sip. Belgian yeast here too.  The finish is creamy and sweet, spicey, subtley fruity.  Hands Down, the best beer I had last night. Probably the most complex of this style I've ever had. Never had it before but I will seek this out again because it was simply amazing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S- Smells of bread dough and Belgian yeast - straightforward, uncomplex, uninspiring.  T- Sweet & sour balsamic vinegar and malt. That's about the extent of it here; this was a rather boring beer.

Amber colour or perhaps burnished dark hardwood floor - the lacing is patchy.  S - sweet dark fruit - some yeast - reminds me of the liquer in a brandy chocolate. a few swirls produces a powerful smelling sweet ale - malty  T - definitely dark fruit hint of banana/cloves - the 8% abv is well masked unless you take a good pull aty which time the devil on the side of the bottle appears on your shoulder - some hops in the after taste gives you a love nibble  M - pleasant sweetness and carbonation lingers on the tongue however medium body at best  O - I have always preferred La fin du monde from unibroue however this bottle makes it a toss up in my opinion - Clearly this is not a session ale but I would have no difficulty drinking half a dozen in a ""session"" (with no plans to drive of course).

Haven't had this beer in a few years, so lets see how it compares to the hundreds of others I have tried since...  Pours a deep amber/brown with a thick fizzy head that quickly settles into about a 1/8 inch thick silky looking head. Aroma is beautifully balanced for the style - fruity esters, Belgian yeast spice, fruity/sweet malts, and faint tea/herbal aromas. Flavor is very sweet/candi like upfront with a big Belgian inspired yeast-funk, some clove/banana, and finishes with a sticky sweetness. Alcohol creates a pleasant warming presence. Bubbly on the tongue with a creamy mouthfeel. I have always enjoyed this style and this brewery really knows the style. Very well done beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jacobseyb,3.83,"Poured from the bottle into a snifter. I always love the labels of the Unibroue beer and this one is no different. Generally a brown, rusty color with some cloudiness. The head is a lighter off white color with close to one finger in height, it sticks around for a while and laces some as well. The beer smells very Belgian in nature with darker fruits and spiciness. Smell faintly reminds me of a cabernet. Breadiness is more apparent in the taste, with the spicy, dark fruits still available. Great carbonation that dances around quite well, and for an extended period. Overall a very enjoyable beer, in the Belgian Strong Dark style that is becoming one of my favorites. Looking forward to a few more of these.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jifigz,4,"Bottle poured into my Victory Tulip.  A: A nice rich brown/caramel color. Nice white head that dissipated rather quickly and lingered slightly.  S: Similar to the other Unibroue Belgians I have had. It is overwhelmed by fruity esters such as raisin and apricot.  T: Very sweet and raisin-like as the smell suggests. The alcohol is warming to the mouth and throat. The sweetness fades and leaves a slightly bitter flavor in the mouth.  M: Medium bodied, alcohol is noticeable from the warming feel. Carbonation is balanced and in check  O: A very good beer from Unibroue, and in fact every one of their beers I have ever had has been delicious. I don't think its doing anything special and new for them though. La Fin Du Monde is certainly still my favorite brew of theirs.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Jeriacor,4.08,"Picked this up from bevmo cause it looked interesting. I've liked other Unibroue brews. Let's see how this is.  Poured from a 75cl bottle into a snifter. Freshness date shows 07-02-2012.  Appearance: It pours a beautiful medium amber color with a massive off-white head. Looks great. The big head fades quickly and this beer has some long lasting lacing.  Smell: Brown sugar, yeast, cloves, seeds, and spices. Cinnamon apparent also.  Taste: Tastes of yeast and many a spice at first. Slight apple/pear flavor as well. Brown sugar, cinnamon, and some kind of seed I can't identify, also a vague pumpkin flavor, and vanilla. Hops are very downplayed here, this brew is about the malt, which is warming and satisfying. There's plenty of complexity here, far more than my unrefined palate can pick out.  Mouthfeel: Extremely smooth and warming, not very dry, but not incredibly wet either. Quite nice.  Overall: I enjoy this beer, solidly. Very high class and filled to the brim with warming spices, perfect for those cold days. For a beer who's name means ""damned"" this beer is quite far from hell, maybe even heavenly. A beer to enjoy any day you are looking to enjoy great tasting beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A: murky dark cider color, the fizzy head quickly falls into a typical spiderweb Belgian cap with good lacing.  S: brown sugar, clove, dried dark fruit, banana bread, just a hint of Belgian funk.  T: the front is full of dried and over-ripe fruit (mainly banana), the middle features a lively spicy character, with clove, nutmeg and bit of white pepper, the finish is just mildly earthy and the spices hang around for the duration of the ride, the hop finish ranges from floral to mildly herbal. The alcohol is quite well hidden.  M: light to medium-bodied, satiny texture, and plentiful carbonation makes for a palate-cleansing beer.  O: I would consider this a great gateway beer to the larger world of Belgian-style brews. Not too funky, not supremely complex or challenging, but very tasty and true to style. It is a natch below the truly world class examples of this style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Smakawhat,3.7,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. Best before 08-02-13.  Very small pop off the cork while opening. Tight rock like off white caramel head that is about 2 fingers but falls pretty steady. Body is a nice caramel dark brown body that is a bit opaque. Head seems to fall and keep a half finger and nice slow carbonation from the bottom.  Bouquet is a mix of fig, plum/cherry/berry likfe fruit, slight buttery movie theatre popcorn (diacetyl), almost Angostura sense of bitters also. It does smell a little like cocktail bitters.  Taste in the palate is a small soft cherry, but the finish is a nice slight fizzy tolerable carbonation with a bit of almost, woody sense, even tree bark. Kind of leaves a tannic quality and a woody caramel malt aftertaste, kind of neat. Soft cherry at first is hard to find after a couple of sips again. A little gaseous.  Overall though, somewhat enjoyable, but I'd grab something else in this style I think.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,chinchill,4.25,"12 oz bottle dated ?-21-2012. High end bottling with gold foil on neck.  Pours a hazy amber with an ample bone head that has good durability. Cloudier after adding last 2 cm of bottle contents.  Aroma - unique, complex and interesting. Orange, other ripe fruits and citrus, alcohol notes and sour yeast. Also thought I detected a faint aroma of fresh hops when I first uncapped the bottle, although this seems unlikely.  Flavor - again unique, complex and interesting, but not exactly what I was expecting given the aroma. Sweet as well as slightly sour, with a nice dynamic interplay that changes both within and between sips. Nice long finish and aftertaste.  Smooth, medium-thin body, with medium carbonation  O - very enjoyable and complex beer that seems to have an ever-changing flavor and aroma. A strong Abbey Dubbel in character. Strongly recommended!

22,33,tjsdomer2,4.73,"Appearance: I loved the look of this. Very murky glowing red, orange, and brown elixir. Foam its extremely thick and takes forever to go down.  Smell: Excellent combination of malty dark fruit with a hint of spicy, peppery hops in the background.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Excellent flavors, same as the smell. Caramel in the flavor as well. Superb. Mouthfeel has a great yeasty thickness to it.  Drinkability: One of the best out there.  Overall: Not quite as good as La Fin Du Monde.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,eduardolinhalis,4.2,"330ml bottle poured in a La Trappe chalice.  A: Very nice bottle art. Pours a nutty-brown color with a medium bubbled beige head. Cloudy. Small retention and just few lacings left  S: Complex. Very Unibroue, I mean, very characteristic smell of Unibroue yeasts. Very spicy and flowery too. Coriander. A bit fruity. Notes of honey, nuts and caramel malts. And a bit of alcohol in the end  T: The best part. Very candy and molasses sensation nevertheless, just a little bit sweet. Dark fruits, mainly raisins. Quite intense bitterness. Despite the sweet smell, the taste is dry. Intense on caramel malts and nuts. Aftertaste is quite spicy with strong notes of coriander and cinnamon  M: Creamy and molasses. Intense and with a nice and soft bitter aftertaste  O: Not as good as Trois Pistoles or La Fin Du Monde but still a great beer",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,csiewert,3.75,"This beer pours a clear nutty brown with a finger of bubbly white head head that dissipates rapidly but does leave some lacing. The aroma has notes of banana and cloves, as well as some flowery esters. The taste is pretty similar with bananas being the dominant flavor. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced and finishes clean. Overall worth a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

However the off-head is retentive and consistent lacing all around.  S: Frankly this smells to me exactly like Fin du Monde. It has an equal fruity estery character in the smell, slightly nutty. More grain than hops in aroma.  T: Has a goody body in the nose, the middle though tells you its 8% and the finish has a cara-malt characteristic.  M: Higher alcohol zipps on the tongue but not in a fusel alcohol way.  D: My bottle was 700ml's and i split it. Dont think I would put the thing back myself but a good beer now and again. Interchangeable with fin du monde in someways, but less attractive. I just want to be in the canoe.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Knapp85,4,Maudite is alot better to me now than it was the first time I had tried it. This beer pours out as a lavish red color with a tan head. The aromas of brown sugar and fermented fruits come from the top of the glass. The hops aren't really noticeable. The taste of the beer is sweet up front from the fruits and sugars. The aftertaste is a bit more on the dry side. This beer is worth having again. One day I'm sure I'll pick some up again and have it.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jameswaldo,4.4,"Poured a Best Before 05/05/13 12 oz bottle very very carefully but high into a pint glass to make a big stiff head, leaving a quarter oz of murky yeast lees in the bottle. The yeast taste is so predominant in this ale that I like it better leaving some out of the pour. The head settles in about two minutes, but carbonation is so high, a ring of foam lasts for as long as I can drink this serving. Color is 13 on my SRM chart, hazy with the yeast. Smells sweet and yeasty and alcoholic; can't smell hops at all. Taste is really delicious: the yeast is a funky sour barnyard good solid cheese with sweet malt and fruity juicy bright clear clean feeling that slides quickly from sinuses to gullet as I swallow. The aftertaste seems to make the salivary ducts under my tongue drool, tho maybe that's just because I want another swallow real soon. The yeast is so strong here that malt barely peeks out, and the hops don't show up till a few moments after swallowing. A mouthful held before swallowing blossoms with thick creamy foaming ale joy that you might imagine a bit too sweet and yeasty, but when swallowed it all goes down clean as a flash of orange brown light.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,beerandcycling88,4.2,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter.  A Pours a cola brown color which reminds me of Coca Cola The head is is thin and dissipates quickly but leaves a good bit of lacing.  S The nose of this is very sweet and fruity with a bit of spicyness. Notes of apple are found as well.  T This beer starts with sweet fruit most notably apple. In fact I get a bit of apple cider when I taste this. To round it out there is the slightest hint of hops and a bit of spicyness.  M This beer has a lot of carbonation which gives it a crisp feel which tingles on the tounge. While it borders on almost being overly carbonated it doesn't quite get there, so it is still quite a pleasant drink.  Overall I would say that this is an excellent beer that is well worth drinking and seeking out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S: Slighty sour actually. Some cherry, a little bit of yeast, and some spices.  T: Tastes almost like a cross between a belgian strong dark, a sour, and a brown. A good bit of caramel, a cherry/kriek like flavor, some sour apples, and some raisins.  M: A little syrupy with nice bubbly carbonation. Medium bodied with a clean mouthfeel.

22,33,shambeano,4.22,"Hmm, coming down to the last few unibroue that i saved when i heard they were no longer exporting to Australia. Poured into a Unibroue tulip.  A- Pours a very dark brown with about an 3 cm of bubbly head that slowly subsides. nice lacing too.  S- there is a touch of fruityness straight up which i get with most unibroue beers, definitely the yeast. dried apricot, dates, some sweetness, and that delicious yeastiness. the malt comes through after, biscuit and a touch of toffee, but the yeast flavours dominate.  T- straight up the yeast flavours come through. bready almost, followed by the fruity characteristics i found in the smell. dried apricot and date, with a sweetness i cant put my finger on. A bit of that belgian yeast character. there is a touch of malt deep in there, but this it takes searching to find. there is a bitterness there, but only to keep the malt sweetness in check, purely a backround flavour which requires searching for to taste as well. on warming there is some alcohol, but it is very subdued and takes nothing away from the beer.  M- there is a tingling carbonation throughout the feel of the bevarage, fills the mouth, and has some thickness without being over the top. the finish is dry without being particularly bitter.  O- this is a great beer. awesome yeastiness dominates, suplemented by some fruitiness. the standard malt sweetness and hop bitterness play a backround part, but give it structure. very nice. A pity that when im done with what i have i cant get any more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BirdsandHops,4.27,"A: Pours a hazy burnt orange color with two inches of off-white head. The head sticks around in an ever-present cap, though leaves surprisingly little lacing.  S: Some spices on the nose followed by a strong aroma of surprisingly light fruits such as pears and bananas. There are some bubblegum aromas in there as well with a touch of mint. Underneath it all is a bready Belgian yeast aroma.  T: There are some light spice flavors at first proceeded by candy sugar, a touch of bubble gum, and sweet pear-like fruits. The Belgian yeast kicks in towards the end, providing a hearty, lightly spiced bready flavor with a touch of bitterness. The finish is clean and crisp.  M: Medium-light body with a good amount of carbonation, this beer is nicely attenuated, adding a crispness to it that belies its flavors and gravity.  O: An excellent beer. An interesting and very nice aroma with a solid flavor profile to back it up. Like all Unibroue beers, they also do a very good job with the attenuation, keeping them from being overly sweet and syrupy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,cmartin45,4.43,"This is my first review, so here we go...  A - Poured into a lager glass and has a great amber/red color with a slightly off white head.  S - smells of malt, yeast, a hint of spice and perhaps rasin or prune. I can't place the spice though, maybe a little coriander...  T - Nice mouth feel with a nice balance of malt, yeast and spice. Good body and the yeast and spice takes over in the aftertaste and gives a nice finish, similar to the other beers from Unibroue. The spice notes stay the longest on the tounge as the malt and yeast just melt away.  O - Wonderful beer with a lot of complex flavors, all in balance. This is a very drinkable beer with good feel in the mouth and a nice subtle finish.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,ummswimmin,4.5,"I aged this bottle approximately one year from purchase. I didn't really age it on purpose... just felt like drinking it today. This isn't my first Maudite, just first time reviewing the beer.  Before I start, I have to say that I am a fan of this brewery. They make multiple good to great beers. I suggest this brewery to friends as a great value when compared to cost.  Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. The color is a pleasant shade of brown with a one and a half finger head. The head dissipated pretty quick in half a minute.  I smell the maltiness and some kind of fruit. I think it smells like raisins. This is reminiscent of a Belgian.  The flavor is rich with the belgian flavors. I enjoy the flavor of the hops and raisins come through even more. This is an enjoyable experience. The mouthfeel is perfect, and the after-taste is very similar to each drink...it is consistent.  I recommend this brew to others, and it is a perfect blend of flavors. Not at all overwhelming.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,brouwer,4.25,This is not my first try of Maudite. I have returned because it is relatively easily available in Montana. This cannot be said of many fine beers. I appreciate its dark strong color and character. It is smooth with pleasant taste and mouthfeel. It has a good balance of yeast and pleasing combination of flavors. The head on my current bottle was relatively flat compared to previous bottles. Not the best Unibroue but not a disappointment.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bobhits,3.33,"Carbonation my name is Maudite! After a quick pour, the glass is filled with thick creamy head, but more impressive the bubbles on the bottom of the glass are nearly as thick! A darker amber color that's a touch merky. That said back to the head, this is the creamiest thickest looking stuff I've seen. Truth be told it doesn't float a bottle cap that well, but one certainly does float on it (I should say the chimey glass doesn't make for cap floating foam always).  Light spiced sweet malt. Not much more to say on the nose. I think there is some vanilla in here and well, this beer smells as ""vanilla"" as one can. Even the macros are able to make me notice what they smell like (only you know they smell like grain and alcohol had a baby that they crapped on).  I always enjoyed belgiums that didn't try to over power one with overt flavors. I like the subtle mixed and mellow flavors. This however is too mellow. Toffee and toasted malt are there but certainly more subtle than I'd like. Certainly spices are present along with a bit more sweetness from the yeast, but overall this is pretty unimpressive stuff.  This is creamy near perfect stuff in the mouth. I really can't express how well done this beer is here. The carbonation that gives off that amazing head, lacing, etc doesn't over power and create a beer that I have to burp up. It is creamy and smooth from start to finish.  I'm impressed with how well crafted this beer is, but it just doesn't taste that great and the smell is about as boring as anything can be.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,output01x,4.07,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  An average pour brings forth a massive 2.5-finger head before the pour is even finished. The giant pillow of creamy off-white head rests atop a hazy amber-colored body but slowly recedes after a few minutes to an even dusting. Lacing is rather light and could have definitely been better.  The smell is fruity with notes of ripe banana and red apple. A light maltiness is also detected.  The first sip throws me off entirely. From the nose, I was expecting dark sweet malts and notes of tropical fruit. Instead, I am given a very mellow caramelized malt coupled with tangy banana and a light alcohol warmth at the end. A very slight hop presence is also detected which helps to keep this beer light and balanced.  Light bodied with moderate carbonation lets this beer flow over your tongue nicely and leaves little covering or stickiness. Very sip-able, but it doesn't stick around to remind you to take another sip.  Maudite definitely has great drinkability, but I would have preferred a slightly heavier body and stronger flavors. On the plus side, it is very thirst-quenching and is almost as easy-going as a hefeweizen. However, for the style, I would have liked it to be a bit bolder.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Aiptasia,4.82,"Enjoyed from a 12 oz. brown bottle. I can't get enough of Unibroue's offerings. Whatever they're doing up there in Canada, it's perfection. They're making some of the most excellent Belgian-style big beers this side of the Atlantic.  A: Pours a brilliant honey ocre into the mug with a big head that rapidly dissipates. The lacing is lasso-like and very fine and drapes as easily as fine Netherland's lace around the mug.  S: Smells of orange honey, cloves, anise and four leaf clovers.  T: Just like the smell, a rich combination of citrus and sugary-sweet notes from the hops and barley malts. Rich and complex sweetness up front with a wet middle of caramel/toffee vanilla notes with only the slightest hint of citrus bitter from the hops. Mildly dry, cheese finish similar to edam or a good white farmers cheese.  M: Smooth as silk. Carbonation is micro-fine and dissipates rapidly. Like drinking milk-fine carbonation. Alcohol is well balanced and this one pours down the throat super soft. Glug, Glug, glug.  O: Vastly exceptional. It's almost as perfect as the finest Big Belgian trappists.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,gueuzeonhigh,4.42,"Pours an amber-straw color with a small head that settles down like a coverlet over the beer's surface. The head left a hair of lacing on my glass...  This beer produced a very cordial nose-- filled with yeast tones, floral ensemble and a hit of some hops. What a nice precursor for things to come...  Flavor was tangy and ""bright""- with the yeast as a predominant but not overpowering addition-- tart citrus, commingled with a hops bitter like tone, maybe granny smith green apples and some malt thrown in for good measure.  Mouthfeel again- quite cordial with the flavor body having ""weight"" that kept this beer's flavor ""alive"". And thanks to it's tart character and the effervescence the finish lingers beckoning me to take another sip. I wanted to keep this going!  Overall a rather enjoyable beer- The yeast, and tart-tangy flavor experience made this beer without question one crafted in the Belgian style. No question a strong ale and a very enjoyable one at that!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Wamesit,4.7,"A - Pours a deep hazy amber, almost natural cider, color with a thick white head that gives way to dramatic clumpy lacing.  S- Fruit esters and alcohol.  T - Fruit and bready malts. A honey sweetness is present alongside a spice (clove) that appears moreso after the ale warms a bit. The alcohol is less present than it is in the aroma but it makes its presence known. The slightest touch of hops in the finish.  M - Medium, lush. Crisp carbonation.  O - Unibroue with another champion ale. A true Belgian Dark. Drinkable, strong, amazingly layered and complex.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

M: Light in the mouth, refreshing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Brunite,4.15,Appearance: Pours a very light brown...similar to an iced tea color. Hazy. TONS of carbonation stream up the side of a tulip glass. A nice head is maintained due to carbonation.  Smell: The aromas are predominately floral. That distinctive Unibroue yeast. Some sweet malt is detected.  Taste: Taste is fruit and spice. I get a lot of spiced apple flavor. Also some green grape. Just a touch of white pepper. A bit of sweetness on the back end before a dry finish. Simple and complex at the same time.  Mouthfeel: It has tons of carbonation and a quick swirl freshens the head.Smooth....almost creamy. It has a dry finish.  Overall: Alcohol is well hidden. This goes down easy. Very nice.

Nose is spices, dark fruits, Belgian yeast auromas. Taste is very smooth, balanced well and the dark fruits and spice dominate the flavour. Medium bodied and well carbonated. One of the better Belgian Strong Dark Ale's I've encountered. The abv hits at a certain 2/3rds through the beer, one bottle is my limit for a session including Maudite.

I noticed some yeast sediment, from the bottle refermentation noted on the back label. Looks kinda muddy and unappetizing. Aroma is spicy, sweet perhaps.  Noticeable alcohol taste, unappealing acidic and sour taste, carbonation is too much IMO. Medium-bodied mouthfeel.  I think this beer was very disappointing and didn't enjoy the taste. The 8% abv seems strong and makes it less drinkable for me, and I didn't even finish the bottle. I don't know if this beer is a good example of the style but I won't drink it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mariposafan,4.18,"Pours an amber/cherrywood color - very clear - with 3 full fingers of creamy head. The head dissipates to lacing a little too quickly.  The aroma is pure Belgian yeastiness. A little more of it, though, would have been nicer.  The flavor is also very big on Belgian yeastiness. Some fruitiness as well and a little too much alcohol. There's also a little tartness that I'm having trouble placing.  The feel is a little bit disappointing. It's a little too thin/watery and the carbonation is a bit too prickly.  Easy enough to drink but the alcohol is enough at the forefront to make sure that I wouldn't want more than one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,david18,3.53,"I'm not a huge fan of Belgian Strong Dark Ales but I always want to try everything and since this beer is so ubiquitous I had to have a glass of it. Got a 12 ounce selection at the Amsterdam Ale House.  The color was very dark with a mahogany/cherry look that was very nice and appetizing.  Aroma had a lot of the classic belgian strong dark characteristics including dark fruit, a little bit of roast and some yeast.  Flavor was a little bit strong on the malt, which may be the reason I don't like this style. I kept wanting the alcohol and maybe even some hops to balance it a little bit.  I enjoyed this beer but didn't love it. I think, as an 8% beer however, this is a very drinkable example of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

It smells sweet and rich at the same time. The first taste gives a lot of flavor of apricots. A very smooth beer with a lot of flavor. Easy beer to drink, but it does not lack on the deep layers of flavor. It would be a great beer for almost any occasion. Cheers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Drinkability is good as well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mpyle,3.65,"App - Nice amber color, paler than I expected. Great clarity. Poured a decent sized head that dispersed pretty quickly.  Smell - good Belgian peppery yeast smell, a touch of malty sweetness, maybe some cinnamon. No hop, alcohol well hidden.  Taste - Spicy pepper character from aroma most prominent in the flavor as well. A slightly thin and cidery, almost acidic flavor competes with the yeast.  MF - Fairly light body for the strength, and moderately high carbonation. Carbonation gives it a bit of bite on the tongue. Alcohol warming and carbonation combine to enhance the warming going down. Alcohol character is well controlled.  D'ability - A bit bland to my palate, and not a favorite for me among the Unibroue family. Carbonation a bit overwhelming to me, but I may have let it warm up too long.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ktrillionaire,2.2,"A - It pours a lighter brown hue, translucent, perhaps akin to iced tea. It is capped with a big ivory head that quickly retreats and leaves no lace. Though tidy, it does not project a proper BSDA appearance.  S - This beer is very yeasty and very dry in its aromatic impression. I am informed by a dude at the bar posing as a knowledgable fellow that the reason for this is ""because it is 'on lees'"". What a douche. Anyhow, a good amount of cloves, red apple and grape skins are implied through the nose; there is also a less-than-pleasant aroma of seemingly underroasted grain, Ovaltine, and/or Grape-Nuts.  T - The taste is more spicy-phenolic than the nose would suggest. There is an appreciable dark fruit character, suggesting less-sweet figs, raisins and papaya (not dark fruit obv.) Unfortunately the fruit flavor is not quite sweet enough and as a result the whole thing ends up more wheat-y tasting like a mediocre Weizenbock. As I get deeper in the glass, the Weizenbock comparison is strengthened: the flavor seems to be a cardboard-y malt, cloves and coriander, two-week-old Fig Newtons, all topped off with a hint of isopropyl.  M - Too thin and just wrong all-around.  D - Jeez this stuff sucks. Unibroue makes some pretty horrendous beers, with a few notable exceptions.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A two finger bready head tops and then slowly dissipates into a thin lace.  Smells of bread and some light fruit. A sip is that bread and the caramels in the malt profile.

Scent is big on the carmel and fresh yeasty bread, very pastry like, notes of watery fruit and some light roasted nut. Taste was not as sweet as expected, instead the taste of dark baked white bread is about even with the sweet carmel notes, again watery dark fruit and roasted nuts present.

22,33,GarthDanielson,3.95,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip, the beer has a hazy, ruby-brown coloring with a thin layer of dense bubbled foam that starts around an inch thick and quickly recedes to a filmy covering. Aromas are fantastic! Good, sweet blending of caramel malty notes, with a great balance of pretty strong coriander characteristics. Also some hints of dark fruit sweetness buried in the smells. The beer is initially very light on the tongue, and quickly unfolds to a crisp, spicy-malt blend that is a little roasty/toasty sweet, while at the same time slightly sour with a heavy undertone of coriander and nutmeg spice. The lightness of the body does a good job to keep the flavors from being overpowering. The beer transitions to a slightly sour and spiced aftertaste, and a moderately lingering finish. It definitely doesn't let you forget what you are drinking, and makes a great sipping beer. The body, despite being light, reveals a decent lacing on the glass as you get towards the bottom, also. Impressive. A little lighter and bubbly than my preference for the style, but impressive nonetheless.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,nickd717,4.08,"Man, the Top 100 done gone and changed again! Need to get back to 100/100, so here goes a review transcribed from prior RB notes.  750ml bottle from BevMo.  Deep reddish-brown appearance with a lasting off-white head.  Aroma is yeasty with candi sugar, sweet malt, and dark fruits.  Flavor is more of the same, very intense and complex. Well-spiced.  Smooth, full mouthfeel and a long finish.  Nice Belgian strong ale. One I will most surely revisit even though I am a ticker.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Luk13,3.95,"Bottle. Pretty red-brown pour with an off white head. Lots of cinnamon and cloves in the aroma combined with some plums and malt. Pretty high carbonation, prickly mouthfeel that is a bit clear for the strong alcohol presence. Taste is very sweet/fruity and spicy. I prefer this one with a little bit of age on it as the carbonation gets softer and the flavors more polished.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Jesse13713,4.5,"Appearance - Pours a burgundy brown with a slight hint of red. One finger of head with absolutely awesome lacing. Looks a bit musty with more of a brown tone than red.  Smell - Very heavy toasted malts. Smells like sparkling dark fruits, more like a carbonated drink.  Taste - Extraordinarily malty with a bitter swallow. A very fruity feel on the tongue. Unibroue has a signature taste to all of its beers, and this has that signature taste to the end of it. A slight nutty finish that is a bit sour. Cherry fruit tastes.  Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Fairly full bodied. Quite a delicious flavor with cherry fruits in it. Easily drinkable. This is one of my top favorite beers. I've had it several times bottled, but this was my first time having it on tap.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,nosurrender23,3.5,"Grade for the group = B- .  ""Deceptive like the name - but too fruity for others.""  First, the beer pours with about a finger of head and is deep brown in color. The head of the beer leaves rings on the glass as you drink it. One described the looks of the beer as being ""Harriet Tubman's piss?""  After whiffing the beer, one gets a fruity, yeasty, spicy nutmeg Belgian smell that kind of reminds you of old apple juice or cider.  In the mouth, the beer has a powerful - heavy, slight carbonation that is ""emotional"" or ""like heaven in one's mouth.""  While drinking the beer, one notices that it has a long finish but is smooth for an 8% beer and contains several layers of complexity that is tricky but tasty but comes ""up a little short just as the French fur traders venture in Canadian colonialism"" or is ""at first sharp, but then nothing like Jason, has a strong Belgian taste that is sweeter on the vine.""  Finally, the taste is layered and complex with layers of fruit such as banana with cloves mixed in that is similar in taste to spiced apple cider that is clean and crisp like an apple and goes well with toasted cheese.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CuttDeez,4.3,A - Amber color with nice carbination and bubbles. The thing that stuck out to me was the stubborn and resiliant head on this beer  S - I smelled the yeast strongly in this beer. It was joined by alchohol and some fruity citrus notes.  T - The best part of this dark belgium. This beer is so complex. At first I tasted fruit and malt. Then the beer was tart and peppery. The hoppiness of this beer made it well rounded and made each sip a different experience.  M - Very crisp beer and rather refreshing considering its heavy nature.  D - This is a very drinkable beer - 'Then why did you give it a 3.5?' because I feel this beer is so complex that you need to drink it slow and think about the sips. Enjoy this but do not over-do your palat!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MrWinky,3.85,"A. Pours deep amber...kinda like a light, and more red than purple, wine but with a nice off-white head.  S. You definitely get some alcohol on the nose. A bit a grape with malt and yeast.  T. The taste follows the nose for sure. Some light spice and grape...alcohol, light malt and yeast.  M. Tastes heavier than it is...for a deep beer its light on the palate. Medium body and finishes dry.  D. Good beer but only for one or two at a time. Great beer for fall and winter",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smell is definitely Belgian style with rich malt, raisins, rice, and taste that mirrors it. Very smooth and easy drinking just as the bottle and store bragged. Nice tart zing with a long finish. Once again very high quality thoroughly enjoyable beer from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Shrews629,3.51,"Appearance - A dark amber, dark copper color. A bountiful head with excellent size, very nice retention and real, real nice lacing. The head was barely off white and settled to a nice skim on top. Looks really nice.  Smell - A pretty strong hint of booze comes through on the nose. The smell is similar to a wine, only a bit more laid back. Some sweetness of grape, flowers and some sweet malt. It smells very, very sweet.  Taste - The flavor again provides a strong hint of booze with some bitterness accompanied by a dry grape. A welcome sweetness distracts me from the heavy booze and alcohol warmth, but the more I sipped, the sweetness became almost overbearing to me.  Mouthfeel - Medium/full mouthfeel. Very dry. Coats the palate very well and provides a lavish amount of alcohol warmth.  Drinkability - This beer is an ok beer for me. It looks fabulous, however the alcohol is a bit strong for me in both the aroma and taste. I don't much care for that much in my beer. I wouldn't be able to have more than one or two of these at a time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Morey,4,"Poured out of a 12oz bottle and into a tulip, this beer pours a hazy brownish-red color. One finger cream colored head has settled to a thin layer after about 5 minutes or so. Moderate head retention.  The aroma is sweet and fruity, yet somewhat mild.  The taste has that typical Belgian zing from the carbonation right up front, followed up by a balance of sweet malts and sugary fruit flavors from the yeast. A bit of a dry finish.  Medium bodied mouthfeel with aggressive carbonation.  I could drink a couple of glasses no problem.  Morey's Bottom Line: A well made Belgian ale for sure. Not my favorite style, and the carbonation is a touch high for my taste, but a very good example of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Moderate collar of foam and film in the center, constantly regenerated by rising carbonation.  smell; hoppy resins and zesty mandarin oranges. A warm yeastyness holds it all together. Really a nice balance.  taste; fruity malts upfront that are quickly blasted by resiny hops. Finishes with a fir tree sap bitterness, balanced with alcohol. The hops taste very North American but then again, what do I know?  mouthfeel; nice spikey carbonation and warm alcohol burn. Goes down crisp and smooth but still some alcohol burn. Overall medium bodied and smooth, causes a slight tart, puckering feeling in the mouth.  drinkability; a pretty easy drink but the alcohol could be better hidden and the hops are just annoying. The hop balance seemed a little off and out of place for the style, still a good beer, just not for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,SebD,4.65,"Appearance: : It has a very nice deep rusty amber colour to it. It has a nice off white head that dies down moderatly and has nice lacing.  Smell: The aromas definitly give out hints of bready malts, spices, fruity notes and yeast.  Taste: Like the aromas, it has a very nice fruitiness to it and I also taste some caramely notes. The malts have a nice character and the hops are light but give the beer an overall great balance. The spiciness of the beer also adds to the great taste and balance. The flavours are very complex.  Mouthfeel: It has a medium/high carbonation with an incredible balance of flavourrs. It has a dry finish but leaves your mouth full of numerous flavours.  Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. The complexity of this beer definitely hides some of the alcohol. It's an overall great, tasty, complex and distinctive Ale. Very impressed. C'est une maudite bonne bière.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CrazyMike,4.85,"Cloudy amber brow appearance with thick head that slowly disappears. Smell is sweet and fruity (orange and citrus) with a hint of spices.  Taste is similar to the smell, sweet with various fruit (same as above, picked up apple and cherry as well). Picked up some decent malt and raisins as well. Medium/heavy bodied and nicely carbonated. Aftertaste has a lingering apple/risen taste, a bit spicy.  Unibroue once again delivers, I have no complaints about this beer except being heavy to drink (which is a good thing, prevents you from chugging 8% beer). Very flavorful, I highly recommend.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CaptDavyJones,4.67,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, with ABV and 'best-by' on the label, into my DT snifter. Murky reddish-brown color with a nice one finger head that dissipates slowly to a persistent thin film of a head. Good carbonation, a steady stream of bubbles generating really nice foam at the center of the surface. Pleasant aroma, with a nice blend of spices (coriander, clove, nutmeg), dark fruits, yeast and the sweetness of ethanol and fruity esters coming through. This 'damned' ale tastes damn good. Rich, silky, creamy mouthfeel. Coats the palate beautifully. Taste upfront if a nice spicy burst and finishing with the perfect amount of sweetness. Gets even better as it warms up. Crisp and refreshing. Each sips leaves you wanting more. The alcohol is also masked very well, making this a highly drinkable beer. Leaves behind some really nice lacing too. One of the finest belgian strong ale's around. A must-try for anyone who enjoys belgian ale's, in fact, it should be tried by every beer lover.

22,33,airheadmtrcycle,3.76,"Crazy label. The ""cursed"" free falling in a canoe to Hell. Why a canoe? Only jet skiers go to Hell.  This is only my second beer of this style, the first being Trois Pistoles.  Another beautiful beer! Mahogany ale with a huge head that fades quickly with nice lacing. I forgot and dumped the yeast in again. :-)  Aroma is of dark fruit, yeast and a touch of alcohol. Taste is spicy at times and then other times quite smooth. The alcohol taste is intermittent as well, but is never too obvious. Dark, ripe fruits dance in and out. A complex brew, for sure, and one that may be a little advanced for me at this time.  The mouth feel is nice and tingly, but a little thinner than I prefer. I am surprised how thin the beer feels at times. I expected something a tad more meaty. I'd call the drinkability slightly above average.  This has been a difficult beer for me to review. I don't know if that's good or bad.

The bubbles stick around for a while.  The smell is as complex as the color. The orange liquer smell is obvious. In addition you'll note some hard candy, dark fruits like grapes, and even some alcohol.  Has a grapey winey vinous taste to it. Dark fruits and a bit of orange.  There's a party on the palate. It starts off with some sweetness. In the back of the mouth you get only a hint of bitter. Deep in the swallow is a touch of heat from the alcohol followed by a dryness to the mouth.  This is exceptional in all facets. Despite 8% ABV, it goes down very easy and because it's a dry finish, it leaves you wanting for more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Burnt sugar, malt and banana on the finish as well as the alcohol that I was missing. Very complex flavors. I had to have a few sips before I could begin to start to pick things out with certainty.

Aroma: Very pungent and a bit musty. Theres a malty backbone on top of which various fruits--prunes, pears, dried grapes--are layered.  Taste: Brawny yet complex on the palate. A powerful surge of alcohol meets the drinker at the gate, after which he is taken into a field of fruits. Big malty sweetness and a sprinkling of cloves underlies behind everything. Warming, slightly bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Very strong carbonation is almost overboard for this medium-bodied brew. Clean and crisp on the palate.  Harmony: It doesn't hide the alcohol all that well for an 8% ABV brew. That said flavors develop nicely. I find the ever-so-acrid aftertaste out of character.  Would I get it again?: No. It's a fine ale, but too brash and light for my tastes. I prefer the kind of BSDA you can really sit with and mull over--this one's a bit quick.  Bottled: ?

The head holds well after a hasty pour and some sticky wisps remain behind.  Fruit, yeast and booze come out initially in the nose. Sour cherry and fig come to mind. Honey and toffee with some buttery, spicy phenols; almost a mild potpourri hint. Heavily fermented fruit and lightly toasted brown bread.  More dark and tart fruits, earthy and deep. Candied, dried orange peel, caramel and toffee with tart black cherry juice and wild honey comb. Booze is evident but welcomed. Fig, plenty of yeasty notes and, of course, lingering warmth.  Crisp but substantial up front. Mellow, creamy middle with a warming, semidry finish. Just a hint of acidic fruit mingles with the yeast and booze to create a lingering, pleasant mouthfeel. Somewhat above average drinkability for the style due to the lack of any dominant or abrasive characteristic that would otherwise become burdening. One of my favorite non-Belgian, Belgian-style brews.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,ThePorterSorter,4.3,"Great price, I know good things are to come having prior experience with this brewery.  Appearance: Dark mahogany brown with brush strokes of orange towards the edges of my chalice while being held to the light. A rich white head of approximately 1 cm was formed after pouring, but only a residual head of a millimeter remained after 5 minutes (thanks to the correct glassware!). The edges of the glass have more foam density as if the beer were trying to hold on tightly as I gulp it down. The first initial pour doesn't reveal any yeast sediment, we shall see what gifts the bottle's final pour presents (I suspect a hearty yeast bounty!).  Smell: Sweet fruitiness, potent yeast funk, and a slight note of bitterness at the finish. I interpret the fruit as being that of cherries and strawberries. Definitely smells like it's been locked up behind a cork for quite some time.  Taste: The taste is strong and rich, characteristic Belgian, with terrific translation from the beer's nose and appearance to its flavor profile and mouthfeel. There is formal drinkability when the beer is cool, but I prefer to let things warm up and see how earthy the beer becomes. Tasting highlights are citrus, green tea (bitter dryness), and berries.  Mouthfeel: The beer's carbonation gives a refreshing bite with each sip, yet each sip remains creamy, smooth, and medium bodied. This beer holds up with a swish around the mouth, more acetone is released upon doing so. It wouldn't be a Belgian strong dark ale it I didn't note its ethanol strength (8%abv), but it's well hidden comparatively.  Drinkability: Excellent buy, excellent PRICE, and perfect for sharing with someone not keen to your beer obsession. It has as much complexity as any bottle of wine and offers a unique experience for any beer drinker. I will get this beer again just to share, but still wonder whether the 4-pack is a better buy than the 750mL bottle (for reasons other than just unit price). Highly recommended that you try this beer (at least once), but especially if you are new to Belgians/not sure if you like the Belgian beer style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Approaching opaque, but still somewhat translucent. A one finger white head that soon recedes to a thin layer. No lacing. Ruby highlights and a tower of bubbles streaming from the base of the glass are both visible only when held up to a bright light. Growing more murky as I approach the bottom of the glass and the yeast settles.  Awesome aroma. Sweet fruity and spicy like cinnamon candy or spiced apples. Swirling the beer releases aromas of doughy, yeasty bread and alcohol.  Huge malty sweetness and heavy on the cloves. Dark fruits stewed with spice. Obvious Belgian yeast.  Medium-thick body. Creamy, but with a definite bite of carbonation and burn of alcohol.  Flavor and aroma abound, and while the Belgian character is front and center, it's not over the top.

Spicy and sweet malty flavors blending with boozy heat and dark fruit, all wrapped up inside the funky Belgian yeastyness. Long legs.  Dark fruit comes through stronger than in the nose, as does the mildly bitter hop influence. Bit it's defined more by the malty sweetness, and spicy Belgian yeasty funkyness. Smooth and complex. Probably too sweet for some, but I'm a fan.  Assertive carbonation, modest warming, rich full body and viscosity.  Surprised that I hadn't reviewed this, as I've enjoyed it many times.

22,33,Bogforce,3.82,"S: Very hoppy and roasted malt smell. Kind of a sweet hop smell T: Decent amount of carbonation, with a malty sweet flavor. Definitely some orange peel flavor  M: Kind of bites your tongue with the carbonation but leaves you with a smooth sweet malt flavor.

22,33,DaveBlack,4.6,"A: Cloudy, brownish orange with a thin layer of off-white head that lasts forever. Very full rings of lacing.  S: Sweet spices, some fruit aromas (almost smells like citrus and cherry), yeast and a touch of alcohol.  T: Malts are the first flavor, but also a nice fruity sweetness. Following that comes the yeast, then clove flavors. The taste of alcohol is present, but restrained enough that it compliments rather than over-powering the beer like it does in some beers. Really great tasting beer, it seems like different notes come out on every sip.  M: Medium body, quite a bit of carbonation, ever so slightly sticky.  D: Incredibly drinkable beer. The alcohol warms nicely as it goes down, and it keeps tasting better. A truly exceptional beer. Worth seeking out for sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,FanofHefe,4.32,"Pours a light brown hazy body over a large bubbly tan head. Good sticky lacing along the glass.  Superb belgian aroma of spices, fruity esters, and bready malts. A hint of raisin and other dark fruits.  Complex flavors following the aromas. Additional notes of caramel and light citrus on the palate. Great blend of flavors in this one.  High level of carbonation, but not excessive. Very little notice of alcohol for the relatively high abv. All around great bsda.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Swedes21,4.05,"Served in a chilled glass  Appearance - beer pours a dark amber, white fluffy head, kind of murky in appearance. It is hard to tell the carbonation levels. I found there was some nice lacing as well.  Smell - I can smell some citrus, from orange, raisins and malts. As well, there is a nice added amount of spices. Not much liquor smell either.  Taste - I am able to pick up the caramel along with the orange based. As well, there are raisin hints to this beer. I found the aftertaste was not bad, you could pick up the alcohol at the end, nice feel. There is a good balance to this beer as well.  Mouthfeel - The added carbonation brings the deeper fruit tone fwd as well the raisin taste. The beer develops a nice velvet feel, very well done.  Drinkability - Really enjoyed this beer, was good to try and sample and enjoy. Something i would stock for sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheHopMonster,4.2,"Hazy dark orange with a puffy white head. I cant see the other end of the glass it doesn't let much light through. It sticks around for a very long time. Fast rising bubbles signaling a decent amount of carbonation.  Holy crap a lot going one with this one. It smells of spice and caramel malts, along with some fain citrus notes. You can tell this beer is hovering around 8 percent, the alcohol esters are pretty pungent.  Strong malt flavor upfront, with a ton of Belgian spice from the yeast. Bready middle note and a dry finish with a nice warm feeling in the back of the throat.  Amazing flavor, overall a great experience I cant wait to drink more of it so I will wrap up this review.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Dark amber color- a great looking beer. Almost too good looking to drink, but not that good!  Smells of biscuits, spices, malts.  Tastes malty with a some belgian yeast spice.  Really tasty, easy to drink. Well hidden ABV so be careful. I drank this one before bed and it put me down for a long winter's nap.  Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Bobby12many,4.6,"A - Pours a nearly opaque amber color capped by a booming refined head that dances with carbonation. Great looking beer, although much lighter and warmer looking than any 'Belgian Strong Dark"" I have ever laid eyes on.  S - A Warm and soothing smell emanates from this lively brew. Bready yeast in the foreground with a touch of sweet citrus. The tinge of Alcohol blends marvelously into the aroma.  T - Much like the nose, bready and soft in the foreground with a finish that is filled with citrus zest and the sweet tinge of alcohol. Slight hop bitterness in the finish which lingers and compliments the warming alcohol. Very Complex. Very unique. Very Balanced.  M - Well carbonated and lively on the tongue. Wonderful warming alcohol in the finish.  D - Extremely drinkable stuff. It has all the sought after characteristics of a good Strong Belgian; Complex and Boozy, yet remains devilishly refreshing for its ABV. An incredibly balanced beer that warps the definition of Belgian Strong Ale. Drinkability is through the roof.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,KYlawyer,4.8,"Considering that the legend for which this brew was named takes place on Christmas, I thought this was a good time review this beer, which I discovered and have been drinking and enjoying for about 3 weeks. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a slightly chilled 12 oz glass beer stein.  Appearance: Nice dark golden-red color, opaque and slightly cloudy; pours into a 3 finger nice foaming head which it retains for about 5-7 minutes before decomposing into a 3/8 foam top, nice lacing on the sides of the glass which it retains and stays about 2 inches above the level of the liquid.  Smell: Very pleasant and ""bready"" with hints of sweet citrus and peaches. The scent is clean and not strong with none of the alcohol odors I've noticed in some other Belgian Ales.  Mouthfeel: Very bubbly with the carbonation hitting the mouth immediately giving a slight spicy feel.  Taste: Wonderful and varied flavors. Very yeasty, but with a sweet light feel almost like white cake as opposed to bread. Notes of citrus and a peachy aftertaste. The carbonation gives a short spicy note. Slightly but not overwhelmingly sweet notes and only a slight hint of hoppy bitterness in the after taste. Very smooth yet bold and flavorful.  Drink-ability: A very nice brew either by itself or paired with strong cheeses or rich sweets. Nice flavor in a brew with this much alcohol and no strong strong overpowering alcohol notes. The alcohol warmth is there, but it is not overwhelming. Goes down very rich in taste. The hops are not very noticeable and if you are a big IPA fan you may not really appreciate this one. I've had other Belgian Ales and noticed they tend to be strong and overwhelming and much to earthy for my tastes. This one is fantastic and renewed my interest in Belgian Ales. All in all for my tastes a wonderful brew and now on the top of my list.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jpro,4.37,"Basing this review on a 12oz bottle, poured into the appropriate Maudite snifter. Man, looking at this bottle, I think Unibroue probably makes some of the best label designs. Anyway...  Maudite pours a murky (ie, yeast-tinged) copper / red with a one-finger almond head. The head doesn't stick around too long, quickly dissipating to a thin layer of foam that, more or less, clings to the sides of the glass. Upon taking a few whiffs, I get a lot of spicy yeast and bread notes, as well as some characteristic Belgian estery aromas. Caramel is also prevalent, along with some ripe peach pith and a touch of fig. Perhaps some earthy hops in the nose, too. Very sweet.  Taste is of rich caramel and perhaps some very light toffee, along with a nice blast of clovey spice. Earthy bitterness does a nice job undercutting the malt sweetness. A deceptively medium-full mouthfeel is almost masked by the spicy crispness of this brew. Its very smooth and just a touch viscous on the palate.  Overall, I think that this is a very enjoyable beer... especially in the fall or winter, as its spiced character makes it seem very fitting for colder weather. The spice kind of reminds me of a pumpkin ale... interesting. A very good Belgian-style ale... very tasty, smooth and complex.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,travis224,4.16,"Pours a brownish red color with a tight white head and little laceing. It smells like Belgium. Fruity, esthery and medicinal notes with a bit of bread or toffee. The mouthfeel on this is incredible, a nice light fizzy carbonation. Hints of raisin, cotton candy, a bit of bread. Highly drinkable and delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheBrewo,4.04,"Our pour reveals an opaque, tawny colored brew. It is hazy with medially visual carbonation. The head is off-white and two fingers high, and recedes at a medium speed. The aroma is rich and salty. Esters, spicy clove, and smoky cedar dance around the nose. There are also dark fruits at play, specifically figs and raisins. The taste begins with dark malts, which convey saltiness, and sweet fruity esters. As we move to the middle there is a complex bitterness. There are the faintest grassy hops contributing to this, but it comes even more so from bitter black pepper, raw clove, and lemon rind. The affect carries into the finish, which is also added to by a mouthwatering saltiness, faint roast, grape stems, and a light, but bitter sulfury component. The aftertaste is the same. As was apparent from the taste, the mouth is left watered. It is, however, quickly dried by astringency. The body is medium and the carbonation is mild. The abv is nice and high, but there is little warming. The drinkability is somewhere in the middle, as the alcohol content and certain flavor components keep it from disappearing more quickly.  Overall, the best thing about this brew is its fresh aroma. While related, it is almost more reminiscent of a Belgian tripel, rather than a strong dark ale. It remains clean, spicy, and vibrantly complex, with a nice helping of sweet, balancing esters. When you then taste, it is almost underwhelming. You are expecting this creamy and sweet, yet spice-laden brew, but are presented with something a bit lighter and less robust than one would expect.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smells were light but good- Belgian yeast,light fruit & spice. As others have suggested- seems like it falls between La Fin Du Monde & Trois Pistoles-which is a good thing.

S: Kind of smells like La Fin Du Monde. Its got that similar belgium yeast smell. A bit of spice as well, but this one has some carmel malt notes too.  T: Starst off slightly sweet with a bit of clove and spice. Similar to the other Unbroue beers I've had, but this one has way more of a carmel malt presence that is not found in Don and Monde. Finishes a bit dry, a bit of oakiness/wood flavor and a bit of that fruity/spice from the yeast. Its good, but I think I still prefer the other two offerings I mentioned above.  M: Medium body. Active carbonation.  D: Pretty good. I like the maltiness in this. Abv is pretty well hidden.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Glory,3.95,"Unibroue, I guess you like it or not. In my opinion its a great bargain for an easy to find cheap everyday beer. They have a few different types of beers as well so its always fun to compare products from the same brewery. Served from a 750 ml bottle to an authentic Maudite Glass thats pretty much a Snifter with a low tulip form. This beer is on lees so its not very clear. It has a dark redish color with a nice white head. Even if the foam leaves after a few minutes, just swirl the it and it will come right back.  The down part of Unibroue is the smell. I think its because of the yeast they use because all Unibroue beers kinda smells the same, but over the Unibroue smell, I get notes of spices and orange peels and somehow...red pepers. You know that smell I've been talking about...well you actually taste it to..I would have no problem guessing a Unibroue product blindfolded...ITS IN THE YEAST!!  tastes alots like dried orange peels, and bread..I get alot of yeast nots on every Unibroue beers. It has a good carbonation level. The breaded taste justs grabs hold of your mouth and sticks...after a few glasses...you will be begin for fresh water. Like I said, its a regular every day beer, nothing more. But still better than a hole bunch of crap you'll find out there. Oh another thing...don't be fooled, Unibroue is not a Quebec product, it now belongs to the Japanese empire Sapporo. They are the ones calling the shots.

22,33,rpardon7,4.7,Poured from the tap a hazy amber to dark redish tint with a tight thin white head with small traces of yeast present. The smell was citrus herbal tones of malt and bread with a small amount of alchohol in the nose. Taste is very complex buscuity malt with herbal and yeast notes followed by a good amount of hop that picks up some of the spiciness and hotnss of the alchohol in the beer. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry almost biting but not overpowerful. The drinkability is nice for a strong dark belgian one of my favorites from Unabroue.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S: This shows notes of spicy earthiness, sweet dark fruits, and undertones of banana.  T: The flavors are rather mild, even as the beer warms, with notes of coriander, peppery yeast, sweet plums, and red grapes.  M: This is moderately carbonated throughout and dries the palate quite a bit in the after taste.  D: This does not quite meet the lofty expectations of a Unibroue offering.

22,33,TheSteiny,3.68,"A- Had a decent sized head, and good color to it. It dissipated faster than I would have liked. However, the color definitely offset the head issues. Had a great burnt orange color. Not cloudy by any means, but not crystal clear. Let a moderate amount of light through, but given the packaging, that is far from an issue.  S- Somewhat hoppy smells, with a hint of citrus and some light earthy/woody tones.  T- Fruity taste, though not to a malternative extent. Interesting mix of berries and oranges. Much less hoppy taste than I expected, but it is still present. There's a lot of character to this beer, so make sure to take some time to appreciate all of it.  M- Light, moderately carbonated feel. I believe due to the fruits and higher carbonation, there is a somewhat caramelized feeling afterwards similar to that of a cola. Does leave some sweet flavors, but not for everyone.  D- I can't say I was a huge fan of this. It definitely has its merits for drinkability. I do not enjoy fruity beers all that much. Despite this, I would not turn down another glass sometime in the future, and I would definitely recommend the brew (if only as a transition for my beer-impaired friends from their malternative shit). As a result, I have given this a higher rating for drinkability, it's simply not for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

I was expecting a cloying beer, but this is surprisingly drinkable. In contrast to many other beers of the style, Belgian candy flavors and clover-like phenols are restrained, which is greatly appreciated. However, I wouldn't label this as a Belgian Strong Dark (like Chimay Blue).

22,33,Satchboogie,3.72,"12oz bottle, best by date: 03/03/13, poured into my Duvel Tulip  A: Light Mahogany, completely opaque. 2-finger off-white bubbly head that dissipates fairly quickly to a thin froth.  S: Dark fruits, caramel malt, spice, apricot, pear, esters give a slight medicinal aroma.  T: Heavy carbonation that sizzles, alcohol makes itself known and mellows out in the finish. This is a very mellow brew flavor wise. I can tastes exactly as it smells (sweet dark fruit, caramel, etc) but isn't as robust as I would have suspect, not that it's a problem. I think it will get better as the carbonation goes down.  M: The strong carbonation isn't ideal, but it does disappear after a while. It's slightly viscous, very smooth and balanced. Goes down exceptionally well.  D: This seems to get easier to drink the longer I let it sit. The carbonation mellowing certainly makes it less harsh and the alcohol isn't too high to be prohibitive.  Overall this is a good strong dark ale, but I'd like to see a little more complexity, less carbonation, and better hid alcohol.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Bouquet of flowers, sharp, tangy citrus, cupboard of warming spices. Mmmm, smelly goody.  Mish mash of strong attributes. There's definitely some fruit/spice going on...obviously. Apples/oranges...dark fruits as well. Phenolic/cloves bite, that's a total plus. Really good.  Has a bite; a bit bitter. Phenolic. Similar to other Unibroue belgian ales. It has a classy and defined feel that lovers of beer should really appreciate.  Unibroue does it again with another great beer.

Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, good smooth mouthfeel. Very tasty and drinkable, this is a great beer from Unibroue!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mexikrainian,3.85,"750ml poured into a Duvel tulip.  Appearance: orange-copper with thick white head and silky lacing.  Aroma: metallic, malty, apple and cloves.  Flavor: phenolic, malty and Belgian spices with irony aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: smooth medium body with medium carbonation.  Overall impression: excellent body and smooth finish, but strong metallic taste is overwhelming for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,cmannes,4.25,"12oz Bottle poured into a Tulip.  Appearance: Very dark red amber, with an almost white head. Little lacing.  Aroma: That malty belgian yeast smell. With a slight bit of fruit. Cherries maybe.  Taste: Sweet, fruity. The malts come up in the finish, with a touch of the ABV.  Mouthfeel: Light, crisp. Just the right amount of fizz.  Overall: I like. Very tasty and smooth.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,eric5bellies,4.35,"Drank fro my Duvel Tulip glass  A - Pours a clear copper red colour with smallish white head that reduces to a film.  S - Sweet fruit cake like aromas from the bottle.Once poured takes on some spicyness as well as some stewed cherries.  T - The initial flavours are sweet stewed fruits and followed by small malt, finishing with a nice boozyness.A hint of Vanilla in there as well.  M - Quite high carbonation with a medium body that makes this a smooth drop.  D - I have to say that Maudite is my favourite drop from Unibroue. There are two reasons for that. 1. It could pass for a genuine Belgian Dark Ale and 2 it superb balnce of flavours.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,scott451,4.2,"Gently poured into an oversize tulip. Slightly hazy orangy brown with a one finger tan head which soon diminishes to a ring. Thin foamy lacing.  Dark malts with ripe fruit smells. Some alcohol present. Spicy prume notes. Very smooth, well melded malts. Spicy with clove up front.  Medium body. Crisp but slightly sweet. Good carbonation and a crisp finish. Pretty drinkable for an 8%. Smooth but complex. A top shelf brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,zhanson88,3.82,"Appearance: Ruby colored with with a little over a finger of off-white head. Retention is just okay, lacing is minimal.  Smell: Esters and cloves are the most prevalent smells. A bit of dark fruits and cherry are in there as well.  Taste: A little more maltiness and dark fruits come through compared to the smell. The cloves and estery alcohol is still there too. A little more balanced overall than the smell.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied with prickly carbonation that lends to a peppery feel. Pretty nice for a Belgian style. Drinkability is fairly high for the ABV, but overall it's not the best Unibroue has to offer, in my opinion.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jlandis,4.13,"A - Slightly hazy light mahogany in color with thin white head that soon dissipates into a small ring.  S - Sweet Belgian candi with fresh fruits and a bit of a yeasty spice in the finish.  T - Slightly tart and sweet malt. I love how in the BSDA style brewers are able to capture both a sweet and sour in such a perfect blend. There is nice candi sugar, sweet toffee and fresh cherries.  M - Medium to light body with solid carbonation.  This is another fantastic offering from Unibroue. I haven't had a beer from them yet that I didn't like. This is a great sipper, and if I don't watch out I could drink a few of these in one sitting.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Richardberg,4.04,"A - poured into a pint glass. Interesting looking orange-red-tan liquid, moderate head, not much retention or lacing. Some sediment is evident but doesn't appear to be in the way.  S - malty, fruity, spicy, and yeasty at once. Even a little sourness for good measure. The yeast isn't quite at ""funky"" levels, just enough to be present and ""bready"". Most notable spice is clove. Maybe some cardamom or coriander. Fruitiness spans a wide range from banana ester to orange peel to raisin / fig to sour cherry. Malts are definitely in the roasty caramel category, bringing to mind dark brown sugar. Throughout, there's no hint of imbalance or ""off"" flavors. Exceptional.  T - ok, back to earth. This is still a nice Belgian brew, but it's nothing extraordinary. Many of the fruity smells are muted. Spice comes to the forefront, which is nice, but the caramelized malts get even sweeter, which is not. Tasty enough, but no longer a superb balance, at least to my tongue. Also, it's considerably easier to detect the alcohol than many American style brews of similar strength.  M - moderate to full body, slick, solid fizz even long after the visible carbonation has left the building. Good stuff.  D - drinkable, enjoyable, and quite a bit cheaper than many ""real"" Belgians. Works for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,tylernim,4.36,"This beer has a superb look to it as it sits in my tulip. A completely opaque reddish color, with a slight green tint to it. Brilliant creamy thick head, that maintains for a while, and turn into a perfect ring the rest of the way.  Smells of under ripe bananas, and some floral notes. A touch of malt on the nose as well. Fruity esters and yeast are up front on the tongue, a spiciness is present coming through the back. The high alcohol content is hidden very well.  Great mouthfeel. Perfect medium body with excellent carbonation. Exceptionally smooth. The drinkability is certainly good, but is hindered by the high ABV for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Thorpe429,4.32,"Reviewed from notes.  Pours dark brown with a tan head and some lacing. The nose is sweet with a bit of citrus as well as some clove and other spicing.

22,33,flannelman808,4.09,"Figured I was due for a check up on this one... I havent had one from a bottle in quite some time. This bottle has a best by date of 03 - 17 - 13  A: Per usual it pours with a large billowy off white head. Retention is not so great as the pillow however as it dissipates rather fast. Not a significant amount of lacing either. The beer it's self is a murky medium brown ochre like color. Hints of a dusty orange hue as well.  S: Spicey notes of Clove and coriander jump out at me first, maybe coupled with notes of orange peel. (along with that familiar unibroue yeast smell). Those aromas are followed up with what seems like a very subtle hint of dark fruit... black mission dates perhaps? Raisins?  T: Spice dances on the tongue rather intensely actually and is followed by a zhaou zang sort of surprise you would probably not expect from a belgian strong dark. Along with some very masked sweet dried perhaps candied ripe dark fruit afterthoughts this beer has citrus zest like quality. Im halfway convinced that It's Lime that I am tasting. Strange I'm pretty certain that there is a (albeit subtle) lime like bitterness to this beer and somehow it works amazingly well. Though It's rather hard to define what one can taste precisely flavor by flavor I think its fair to say that this beer is most certainly spice driven and rather dry finishing.

22,33,lacqueredmouse,4.15,"Deep brownish amber colour, slightly hazed clarity in the body, with a full and foamy head of off-white. Lacing is sudsy and Belgianesque. Looks very decent.  Sweet and slightly woody nose, with big Belgian yeast characters and a slightly organic sawdust character. Good amount of spice and a faint citric acidity. Lots of very pleasant characters on this.  Taste is lovely. Very decent Belgian characters, giving a slightly rounded note to the slightly smoky front. Robust and full, but sweet enough to temper anything before it gets too harsh or prominent. Finish is surprisingly fresh, leaving a pleasant crushed organic character on the back. Feel is smooth and light, adding to the really charismatic aspect of this beer. I'm very surprised at how light it is for 8%.  It's a lovely drop of beer. Unibroue do some wonderful things and this is no exception.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

T - malty sweetness, a pleasant orange spice, some vanilla and oak on the end.  M - harmonious flavors coat the palate from start to finish with nice carbonation to boot.

Appearance: A very hazy light brown. The head is a pretty white and settles to a thin foam pad. No real lacing, but maybe it is my glass. This beer even looks delicious.  Smell: Clove, nutmeg and other dark holiday-type spices.  Taste: The Belgian yeastiness comes through. I can also taste raisins mingled with some other fruit. There is some residual sweetness. This is really complex and hard to describe. I am really enjoying the taste.  Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation and body. This a little oily slick in the mouth. By no means a ""thin"" beer.  Drinkability: This could easily stand up to strong or spicy foods. The high ABV and strong flavors would make it difficult to drink many of these one after the other without palate fatigue. These should be stocked in my fridge at all times.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The initial taste of the beer is that of bready yeast, followed by a dominant flavoring of spices. There is an alcohol finish that is present on the nose post consumption. This brew has a medium body with medium carbonation.  Overall, this was a good beer, but lets not kid either, it's not that great. I understand why this makes for a nice A-rated entry beer, however this beer is too sweet for me.

There is also some cherry and plum tastes. Very complex, very good.  M - Light but sticky at the same time. Wonderful carbonation makes for a balanced brew.

22,33,HotHands,4.1,"A - pours a nice opaque amber color with a nice whtie fluffy head.  S - some dark fruit smells (black cherries) as well as some lighter ones like peaches and grapes. Lots of that typical Belgian yeast smell. It's pretty much right in between Trois Pistoles and Don de Dieu in the dark/light spectrum.  T - like many Belgian style beers the yeast is driving the flavor train. Lots of spiciness. The flavor has a more reserved fruitiness than I would have expected, but in place of that is a nice caramel taste that reminds me I'm drinking an amber. The finish is a bit dry and mineral-like, with a slight booziness, similar to some red wines.  M - high carbonation, medium body, fine mouthfeel.  D - the dry finish drives up the drinkability, making up for the high ABV.  Unibroue can do no wrong in my book, and Maudite did not disappoint. I like Trois Pistoles a tiny bit more, and Don de Dieu and La Fin Du Monde even more, but this is still great.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Upfront sweet brown sugar, raisins, sour notes, apples, pears, vinegar and a bit vinous, very little bitterness.  Medium high carbonation, small lively bubbles, soft and rich body, a syrup nuance.

Smell: Belgian yeast with caramel malt and a hint of dried fruits.  Taste: Sweet dried fruit with a hint of caramel up front then spices clove in the middle followed by phenols and a mild hoppy bitterness at the finish. Aftertaste is a mix of dried fruit and malt.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a high amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Very high drinkability. You don't really notice the alcohol at all so this one could very well sneak up on you.

S : A mix of plum, orange peel, breadiness, hints of spice and alcohol esters. A quite potent and complex smell, I found myself continuing sniffing it throughout as it warmed.  T : A buttery flavor opens this one, with notes of plum found in the nose. A surprising level of bitter hop comes in the center to balance bready malt, here's where the orange peel and spice start to appear as well. The finish is more of the spice, and a smooth malt.  M : Very smooth and buttery, and just enough carbonation to give this one a tingly swallow.  D : Unibroue does right on this one, providing a stand-out Belgian Strong Dark that has all the expected qualities and yet remains original by throwing flavors out that aren't normally expected.

The aroma is akin to malts with a very slight sourness. The flavor is slightly sweet but has some spice to it and is VERY nice and pleasant. The body was right in the middle of the spectrum.

Very belgian in the aroma. T- Slightly caramelly, but the fruits present in the aroma were even moreso present here. High intensity flavor. The spice aromas were present in the flavor but just enough to balance out the fruit flavors.

It has some apple, banana, clove and cinnamon coming through. Very flavorful overall and everything comes together pretty nicely.  The taste has more of the apple fruitiness and clove spice to it. It has just some hints of some darker fruits to it. The Belgian yeast plays a pretty big role in the flavors.  The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being above average.

Very thick and not much light could pass through.  S- Apple cinnamon and cloves overwhelmed the nose whenever I moved the glass close to me.  T- Somewhat like you'd expect from the smell. Was for more like a cider than a beer. Hops were barely noticable. I wasn't able to notice many of the flavors that reviews speak of. Perhaps this is due to me not aging my bottle or that I had a hard time separating them. Either way, as a full it didn't impress me.  M- Felt very full and smooth. Not thin by any means.  D- Good, but I would likely enjoy it more warm. It's not really like any beer I've had before. Seems more like something that would be sold outside of the beer section in the mixed drink area.

You can also smell the alcohol slightly. There also is a peppery spice mix scent and a woody aroma.  Taste & Mouth - First thing I notice is a caramel like sweetness. The beer is extremely smooth for 8%, but I still feel the warming effect of the alcohol. The beer comes across as slightly creamy on the tongue as well. And the carbonation is perfect.

22,33,StephenRich,4.31,"Unibroue is one of my favorite Breweries because of their beer's unique characteristics and amazing drinkability. In another post on the Unibroue Chambly Noire we discussed in detail the distinct Quebecois beers that they produce, and also their Belgian inspired heritage. But really, I should have began with the Maudite, the very first beer that turned me on to Unibroue, and also one of the best that they brew, and one of the top beers in the world.  Maudite means ""the dammed one"", and was named after the Quebec legend of the Flying Canoe. As the legend portrays, a group of lumberjacks struct a deal with the devil to fly them home in their canoes. Guided by Satan himself, they made it home in time for Christmas.  The Maudite of one of the beers which opened Unibroue in 1992, and is a Belgian Style Strong Dark Ale, very reminiscent of a wheat beer with very rich a fruity malt characteristics. It is 8.0% abv, is available in 750ml corked bottles at most all LBCO locations, and also in six packs of 341ml bottles throughout Quebec and much of the US. The Maudite is a beautiful mix of Belgium spicy flavors, sweet malted wheat, rich fruity malts, light effervescence, and smooth cognac like complexity. I constantly try to buy bottles to cellar for years, but always end up drinking them long before their intended maturity. But I can almost guarantee that three or four years down the road, a corked bottle of Mautide will have build an immense depth of flavor and maturity.  But don't get me wrong, this beer is ready to enjoy right now! It should be served cold, but not quite fridge temperature. Anywhere around 5 degrees Celsius (40F) will do; the beer will show you layers of flavor and aroma at that temperature, and will begin to erupt with great robust and aromatic life as it continues to warm. Pour it into a wide bottomed tupliped chalice or snifter if available.  The pour is very lively in the wheat beer sense lifting a huge pillowy and fluffy head immediately; so pour gently, and perhaps even allow the first half of the beer to relax in the glass before completely finishing the bottle. Soon enough though you will end up with a gorgeous ruby red beer with a large two inch mountain of head. The beer is hazy and opaque glowing deep mahogany with golden brown, ruby red, and orange ambers shimmering throughout it. The head is filled with air, is very dense, and has huge staying power. It took about ten minutes for it to subside down to a short film, but was even then about a quarter inch tall.  The nose is rich and pours at you with spices of clove, white pepper and light cinnamon. Sweet malted wheat becomes very dominant and soft malty fruit begin to show their flavors. It definitely is ripe with Belgian (or more appropriately, Quebecois) yeast characteristics, and displays light banana, peaches and apples. There is a wine like tart finish to the nose which I suspect will come out slightly in a bitter hop finish.  Although it seems menacing at a rich and deep 8.0%, you should get right into this beer in a big way. Simply sipping it over your tongue will not do it justice. Try a full mouthful and you will enjoy a pouring of malt flavors, massive floral aromas, and a delicate and lively mouthfeel which is unmistakably Unibroue.  The first thing you will notice is a light wheat sweetness that bounces off your tongue and is accentuated by the beers lively effervescence. Quickly though, spices move in brining cloves, allspice, light pepper, and coriander to your palate. The malted wheat sweetness is still there but opens to bananas, apples, light peaches, and pears. More malts come in, but now they are full and rich with plums, oak, vanilla, and a cognac like alcohol complexity.  Overall the Maudite is very layered showing you huge complexity and a perfect mouthfeel which helps you absorb everything that this beer has to offer. It is very lightly hopped, but enough to create a refreshing and pleasant balance. But really, the wheat and the mouthfeel produce a supremely quenching beer perfect in the heat of the summer, and against the warmth of a fire place.  I love it with and in beef stews, grilled rep meals, roast potatoes and yams, pasta, and anything spicy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BobZ,3.33,"750ml 25.4 Oz. bottle. Poured into my Duvel Tulip. Plan to drink the whole thing myself.  Appearance: Head builds very nicely, recedes to about an 1/8"", good lacing throughout, nice reddish brown in color.  Smell: Yeast is dominant; spice & malt are there smells like it has some depth & complexity.  Taste: First impression is ""thin"", especially for a Strong Dark Ale, some nice flavors, bready malt, spice, but overall not very deep and not very complex. The slight bitterness has a very slight metallic tinge in the finish.  Drinkability: Decent beer, taste good enough to be sessionable.  Compared to Trois Pistoles & La Terrible this beer is not anywhere near the same league. Not a bad beer but my least favorite under the Unibroue label.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheHoppiest,3.18,"Had on tap in a small snifter in Ballantine's in Willoughby.  Pours a hazy amber with a foamy head, with a slow pillowing down.  Smells of yeast, malt and lemon. The lemon is definitely catching me off guard.  Has a lighter taste, with some breadiness. There's an odd lemony sourness, rather than bitterness, that hits the sides and back of the tongue as you swallow. This is a strong dark ale?  Mouthfeel is thin to medium.  Decent enough, but not the beer for me. I know it is a highly rated beer by others; however, life is too short for me to have another of these.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,joeland,4.3,"Appearance- it's an amber color with a orange tint. very little head.  Smell- a get a yeast smeel, to go with spices, and malt. a good mix of everything  Taste- i get a up front spice taste expected from the style that fades to a malt taste. very good taste  Mouthfeel- medium body, with medium carbnation  Drinkability- a very good beer that i'm set with just two or three of these.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Anthony1,2.88,"Pours a nice cloudy copper-amber color with a huge fluffy white head and decent lacing. Has those beautiful round galaxy puffs of white floating on the surface. I bit too much alcohol in the scent. Maybe a little floral character. Raisins and maybe some clove. Nice and sweet. The alcohol hides well in the taste. Kind of a thick caramel taste. Quite yummy. Warms you when you swallow, high carbonation, but easy to consume. Considerable creamy.  decent, but kind of boring to me",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,endincolorado,4.17,"A hazy, red-brown with deep orange at the edges and a small amount of off-white head. Lacing is moderate.  Aroma is of sour apple, and light yeastiness.  Flavor is surprisingly sweet, with a healthy amount of bready malt, and yeasty spices. Some appley fruit lingers in back.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with medium carbonation.  This is one drinkable beer, and would pair well with a vast variety of foods. Right now, it's doing a fine job of complementing some pepperoni pizza.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,eclaycamp,4.4,"22 ounce bottle. Pours a ruby mahogany with minimal head. First sniff is funky with a capital F. Trying to discern the aroma is tough. I get figs, almonds, spice, and a tinge of alcohol. Let's just call it complex and call it good. Honestly it's really hard to know what to expect from this beer with the first drink. Flavor is delicious, though almost irrepressibly sweet. There are tons of fruity spices up front, followed by a very desert dry middle, with mild hops and huge alcohol in the finish. Actually easy to drink, considering everything that's going on. Better than average, strike that, actually very nice. Enjoyable. Nice end-of-night beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,impending,4.13,"750ml into a tulip. Pours a deep dirty honey brown, unexceptional. Typical belgian head but the bubbles are not dense. Lacing nothing special.  Excellent example of how to do the aroma of a strong dark right.  Taste follows the nose but the complexity of the spices is increased significantly. A superb brew. cheers jd  An aside ~ I wrote of an unexceptional appearance ~ this is not an unusual adjective I apply but in reality it depends on the level in the glass. The discerning will drink this from a tulip, goblet or chalice - choices all of which provide much width in the glass. The light has difficulty penetrating this width rendering the color, unexceptional. But when only an inch or so remains the appearance is wholly changed. At the end this brew is a magnificent deep amber copper, exceptional.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BeerBATvocate,4.45,"Pours a cloudy brown, somewhat dark. Produced a nice amount of head. Lingered for about half of the glass. Minimal lacing.  Aroma - Smells of dark fruits, yeast, maybe a bit of citrus(but lite)  Taste - Well balanced, tastes of raisin, hop bitterness, lite yeast, and a bit of tart grapes towards the end. Flavor lingers, with a very nice aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Medium body, good carbonation, seems to hang around in the mouth slightly, which is quite nice.  Drinkability - Very nice. Smooth. Not harsh in the slightest. Warms nicely. A nice beer to savor slowly. Definitely will have again, and again. Could have at least two in a row. Very good showcase of the style",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jar2574,4,"Cloudy, dark brown-orange color, 1/2 inch cream colored-head. Fruity smell, maybe cherries, plums. A little more watery than expected. I would say a touch too watery. Very little hint of the 8% ABV. Would be a dangerous one to be drinking for a while, would sneak up on you. Definitely taste the fruit without being too fruity. More malt than hops, in fact very little hops as far as I could tell. Incredibly smooth for the punch it's packing. Easy to drink, quite enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,gameface23,3,"Best by date 06-01-2012  A: Pours a reddish-brownish-orangish color. I was expecting more of an amber hue, but it had much more brown than I was anticipating.  S: A big wave of alcohol esters, some brown sugar, toffee and Belgian yeast aromatics.  T: Again, a piercing alcohol burn, Belgian spice, dark fruits.  M: Average for a BSDA  D: This is probably the worst offering I have had from Unibroue, a brewery that I usually love. It's not terrible, I just feel like it might not translate well to my palate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,damndirtyape,4.03,"Single bottle (best before 06-01-12) poured into a Rochefort Chalice. Poured slowly leaving the sediment/yeast behind, but enough to get a good head.  Appearance: Pours a dark translucent brownish-red with orange highlights. The off-white foam on the top starts 1/4"" thick, then dies down to 1/16"" persistently thick across the top. Islands of lacing here and there. Plenty of bubbles coming up through the beer if you look closely.  Smell: Some alcohol fruity esters (prunes?), toffee notes, and a hint of yeast.  Taste: A well blended combination of hop bitterness, toasted malts, raisin/prune alcoholic esters (a tad boozy) with a dry finish. I must emphasize the balance here - nothing pushes out the others leading to a smooth nature of the beer....interestingly what is emphasized on the bottle. Towards the end of the glass as the beer is much warmer the fruit flavors become more white grape-like in character. A tasty beer.  Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation on the tongue - not too spicy, but just right. The carbonation brings an airiness to the beer, but there is a definite stickiness lingering on the teeth afterwards. Nice.  Drinkability: This is indeed a strong ale - and a great sipping beer, but after one I'm done. I wouldn't mind a larger bottle, but this is a beer for savoring. I think it clashed a bit with the tomato and garlic pasta dish I had with it, but after the meal it was good to savor the beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Florida9,4.42,"A: Murky, hazy brown in color. Pours with a respectable 1/4"" of white head that reduces down to nothing but a ring around the edge of the glass.  S: Sweet malt. Brown sugar. Dark sweet fruits. Even a bit of lemon to round things out.  T: Malt forward fruitiness. A bit of sweet caramel, but with a fresh tartness that helps balance this beer. Spice and a little bit of pepper or clove pop on the back of the tongue. Quite complex and tasty.  M: Medium in body with appropriate carbonation. A sweet roundness in the mouth followed by the crisp tartness.  D: Very good. One of the best representations of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,abriggs1,4.16,"Maudite is an hold stand-by for me. Whenever I can't decide what to get, I always know this stuff will satisfy. Pours with a deliciously thick and rich looking head. The smell is equal parts hops, yeast, and esters. Taste is balanced between all the players. A lot of fine esters from the yeast, plenty of malt, and some nice spiciness from the hops. All of the tastes linger on the palate equally instead of the flavor profile changing in your mouth. A very egalitarian beer. Equally great in the winter as well as on a hot summer night. This beer goes great with Tai food.  Maudite, along with Fin Du Monde, is one of the best values in the beer world. I paid under $7 for a 750ML and that makes me happy. Also, it's prime to drink for a good long time after it's bottled. You just can't go wrong with this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Good stuff. Slightly tan head.  S. dark nutty nose. Strong, but weak at the same time. Slight spice and slight cognac. Not a heavy noze.  T. Similar to the nose but more intense and complex. Nutty, spices, and a slight cognac. Definitely malt forward. A good example of the style. I don't drink reds that often but this one is worth the effort. Nice finishing bitterness for a malt forward beer.  MF. A nice buzz to the mouth. Good lingering flavor.  D. Pretty easy drinker for an 8% abv beer. A nice Belgian strong red ale.

22,33,Soonami,4.3,"This is a bottle that has been aging for 2 years in my 45 F beer fridge. I opened it up to share with friends today as we brewed a dubbel to get some inspiration. The beer, despite several years of cellaring, frothed as I popped the cork and started to pour the beer. Maudite was dark amber with ample head that clung to the glass. The beer smelled wonderfully complex with clove and banana aromas that opened up as the beer sat. A deeper smell pulled up some toasty biscuit and sweet caramel malts. This complexity was reciprocated in the taste: assertive spice, with fig-like fruit that provided a flavor without the sweetness. The body was full despite high attenuation. This is a beautiful beer that I highly recommend and would love to have again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

There is some medium bodied malt to it and a bit of alcohol. I expect there to be more on the nose as the beer warms. Now I pick up a mild sweetness, almost like honey, and some fruitiness and/or pleasant phenols from the yeast.  Taste is well balanced and smooth, though a bit lighter than I had expected. This beer hides it's strength well. There is a little dark fruit and aromatic malt mid way through, and the finish has a mild hop bitterness as well as some light, sweet malt that lingers. The ""assertive hops"" are really nowhere to be found.  Mouthfeel is moderately thick and the carbonation is fairly low.  Overall this beer is fairly sweet, malty and moderately complex.

22,33,ericj551,4.57,"Unibroue Maudite pours a slightly hazy deep red brown with a beautiful fluffy head that lingers. The aroma is sweet, fruity esters, with some powdery, phenolic yeastiness. Ripe dark fruit pops up first in the flavor, with plenty of estery sweetness. The perceived sweetness fades into the dry, yeasty flavors. Hops are muted, some herbal flavors, but it is hard to distinguish them from the earthy flavors from the yeast. The alcohol is well hidden.

Lots of malt throughout without being overbearing. Creamy, medium body and a lovely, smooth finish that was not abrupt or bitter. Lots going on in this brew. It is very special. Pity it took me so long to try it. Don't wait as long as I did.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Phelps,3.95,"Maudite pours a tawny copper, misty and hazed. Love the look. A one-finger grayish-white head with a sandy texture quickly recedes to a thin lid, leaving no lacing.  In the nose, sweet pear syrup and white grapes with a mild flowery hop tinge. A honey/caramel malt sweetness and a toasted wheat character also make appearances.  The taste follows, but with added aspects of raisins, green apples and biscuity malt. There a lot of delicate flavors here working in harmony. A peppery alcohol heat warms the chest. Finishes dry like a good white wine.  Body is medium-light, with a rousing carbonation.  Unibroue never ceases to amaze in their ability to recreate Belgian flavors. Maudite is dainty yet robust, brawny yet breakable. Damned, indeed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Not overly aromatic, with some nutty yeast and ripe banana that become much more pronounced after a bit of swirling. Mild carbonation and a soft entrance that lead to banana walnut, clove, and gingery spice. Fairly quick finish with a bit of lingering caramel, malt, and subtle spice. Didn't seem as sweet or pungent as many other Belgians -- very easy to drink, but less memorable than other offerings by Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Head leaves a little lacing on the glass.  Smells like a Belgian strong ale. There is some good ester character, some sweetness, most of their beers smell the same to me, its the smell of their yeast strain.  Beer is sweet and has a sweet late flavor as well. Lots of carbonation in the mouth obstructs the center palate. Second, slightly bitter that time, beer is pretty good. I like it and I would drink it again (and have several times).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Really liked the color.  Aroma: Very subdued nose of clove, butter, raisins, melanoidin, alcohol aswell as some hop spiciness. Elegant and rich, yet a little too subtle.  Taste: Follows up on the nose. Very shy yet very complex. Some spiciness, Alcohol heat and sour cherries.  Palate: Low carbonation. Low bitterness. Yeast creaminess. Medium-full bodied. Alcohol is well hidden. Slight lactic twang. Finishes sweet, leaving a lingering clove and yeasty flavour.  Drinkability: Very drinkable considering the ABV but lacks that extra oompth in the flavor and aroma department. Fits the style and shows enough complexity. Unremarkable overall.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Naugros,4.35,"I was immediately surprised at the darkness of this beer. It's a coppery brown that would be lighter in aspect if it weren't so hazy. The head starts off a finger thick (thicker if you pour faster, of course), but slowly reduces. It maintains a presence around the edges, extending into the glass so only a little of the beer's color can be seen from above. As I drank I had no evidence of lace.  The smell gives away the Belgian yeast, but like a Belgian brown the caramelized malts come though on the nose. I detected hints of raisin or fig.  All that you smell will transfer to your mouth, but the sweet caramel and figgy fruit is tempered by a floral hop taste with a slight bitterness.  This beer is smooth. Medium body cut by a wonderful level of carbonation that holds throughout until the whole glass is gone. It's complexity gives way to clean wash with little aftertaste.  The fact that there is little aftertaste makes you desire that next sip to regain the flavors. It sits at 8% ABV so too many of these will make your head swim, but the level of alcohol is entirely masked. This is a dangerously damned beer...sorry couldn't help it.  Eat some sharp cheddar with this one. You won't be disappointed!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,WestValleyIPA,3.77,"Had on-tap in a Goblet. A reddish amber hue. About a finger of head. Smelled like typical wheat beer spice, coriander, clove, ginger, etc. Decent mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Could drink down a couplefew of these in an evening.

22,33,wcuberos,4.33,Good two finger head when I poured it. Strong aroma with a hint of citrus and sweetness.  A big maltiness that hits you right off the bat and a good spice flavor that lingers in your mouth. It has a distinct hoppy flavor that finishes off the drink.

22,33,AgentMunky,3.88,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a goblet.  A: A dark woody colour with light, creamy head. Faint trails of bubbles drift up the side of the goblet. Held up to the light, it takes on a copper glow.  S: Smells phenolic and slightly sour. Yeast? A host of complex spices float in the background, of which only cloves are distinguishable.  T: Initially almost sour, with a spicy yeastiness. This melts into a tartness - as if of citrus - before giving way to sweeter, alcoholic fruits. This flavour gently dissipates, leaving a malty note in its stead. Definitely complex, maybe beyond my appreciation. I am a bit thrown off by the unexpected sourness.  M: Pleasant, but largely unremarkable, especially in light of the complexity of taste. Mild tingly carbonation with mild tartness.  D: Definitely an enjoyable experience, but probably not one I'll repeat soon. A sipping beer, of which two glasses tides me over well. Recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Spider889,3.72,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass.  The beer is very cloudy, evidence of the massive amounts of yeast used to referment. I even had a rather thick layer of sediment pour out into my last glass. Ruby bronze in color (the color of fresh maple syrup), this was a very appealing beer. Highly carbonated and very bubbly on the pour, with a very light, small head.  The beer smelled of lemongrass and sage, clove, and sweet sugars. Very earthy and wild smelling, there were a lot of herbal notes vying for attention here. It tasted much the same, there was a lot going on, but overall you notice the lemon and sweetness.  It wasn't my favorite Belgian, but tasty nonetheless and possibly worth trying again sometime.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BreworFerment,2.93,"I love all of Unibroue's beers that I have had, except this one. It's not BAD tasting it's just bland. For a Belgian strong it just lacks any kind of punch. At 8% I would have thought at least I would have gotten some alcohol but even that was muted. Maybe it was an old bottle? It was a high volume place though. I just wasn't impressed. Trois Pistoles is still my favorite of their offerings.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

There is no bitterness at all.  M - Beer is creamy and smooth. There is a bit of an alcohol warmth too.  D - Excellent. Another winner from Unibroue.

Big waves of lacing cover the glass with many being too big to stay and thus slowly settle back into the head. Looks great.  Citrusy, orange coriander on the nose, mixed with sweet malts and fruits. Grapes, strawberries, apples. Touch of alcohol and the signature Unibroue yeast aroma.  The flavor consists of bready, fruit infused malts. Grapes, cherries, a little bit of apple and a touch of slightly bitter orange spice. Wine like and malty. Warming alcohol and honey. Finish is dry with yeasty fruit. Very well done.  Mouthfeel is somewhat foamy and malty with prickly carbonation. Warming alcohol and decently dry on the finish.  Drinkability is good. I would only want a bottle of this, but it is a pleasure to drink. You can feel the 8% a bit, which is good and lets you know you should take it easy. I could see this beer pairing well with many things.  Overall, this is one of the best Unibroue beers I have had and I have had most of them. Rich and flavorful with a beautiful looking body. Unibroue has done a very good job of crafting this gem. I also get the feeling that this would taste quite good with 2-3 years on it. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The kick from the yeast and the sweetness from the malt dominate the taste. Quite smooth though.  M: Moderate to high carbonation. I can swirl my glass long after I've cracked the beer and still pull out a foamy head. A nice crisp, sharp feel up front with some malt and fruit that linger.  D: Easy drinking BSDA.

The smell is of malts coupled with sour, dark fruits with hints of clove. Complementary, but not exceptional.  What sticks out most are the spices are well ahead of the dark fruit flavoring I expect from the Belgian Darks. It's tough to distinguish between pear or sour apple, maybe notes of figs. It finishes smart on crisp hops. Honey is prominent and somewhat smooths out the spices.  A medium body suits this richly flavored complex beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

I've had three quadrupels and a couple other belgian strong ales and I would definitely call this a quadrupel, not a strong ale. It has far too reserved a taste to be considered a ""strong"" ale""...not that that's a bad thing, far from it, this is an absolutely fantastic beer that has a huge flavor hiding behind an innocent 8% Abv (less than their La Fin Du Monde).  A: Wow, this beer has a dark, cloudy appearance with a large, extremely foamy head and lacing. Great!  S: An almost spicy malty smell with a big body to it.  T: A big quad-like roasted malt body with light citrus and hops in the background. This beer warms up better than any other beer I've ever tasted. I let this stuff get closer to room temperture than I've ever let any beer get before and it only tasted better. Truly, this is a masterfully crafted brew with fantastic bottle conditioning that has a big bassy malt body but is far more reserved and refined than typical American attempts at beer along these lines. Bigger flavor than La Fin Du Monde with less alcohol content...very impressive.  M: There's just not enough carbonation for this to truly remind me of a trappist product but it's still great.  D: As mentioned, warms up extremely well. Nearly perfect.  Well heck, I can get this stuff for half the price of my usual Belgians and it comes darn close. The fact that it's made in Canada means that it's a lot cheaper. I'm sold and will definitely be checking out more Unibroue in the future.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S: There's a moderate aroma of malt, sweetness and yeast T: The flavors of malt, caramel and spices become well balanced as the beer warms up; the finish is slightly sweet. M: This only has a light- to medium-body feel on the palate and does not taste as strong as other types of beer in this style.

22,33,TheMadJack,4.69,"Poured from 750ml corked bottle into Chimay chalice.  Pours a murky brown with hints of yellow and red. Minimal lacing on the dull white head.  The aroma is quite spicy and fruity. Cloves, nutmeg, black pepper, oranges, banana, red grapes, pomegranate, lime flesh, applesauce, and more than a little pear. Nice wine like headiness to the smell wafting out of the chalice as well. Absolutely delightful, and I don't usually go for Belgian beers.  The flavor is of a similar spiced fruit theme: allspice, orange, banana, Bartlett pear, and chardonnay over a light, yeasty malt base. Mostly sweet but with a slight acidic tang. And for all this, it's not overpowering in the least.  The beer is a bit thin, but has a milky smoothness that is textured by velvety, effervescent carbonation.  For a Belgian style beer, this one is easy and pleasant to drink. I've got two more servings waiting in the bottle and I'm looking forward to them.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Also has some clove and other spice. Smells fairly malty. The flavor is much more heavy on the clove and pepperyness. Fruit definitely takes a back seat, but there are still pear, sour apple and blackberry notes. Malty, but balanced with a sourness that gives this beer a pretty good finish. The body is medium with somewhat spiky carbonation and really does not do anything for me. I would say drinkability is just okay, as the alcohol shines through more than I would like.

Taste is the real treat here. Fruit tones abound, though it is difficult to discern. Nice and malty is what comes to my mind. Carbonation gives this a nice, tingly feel, seems to dance on the the taste buds. Feels mighty light for a strong ale, though it is highly drinkable because the alcohol content is well masked.

Taste is much like the nose, with strong pear, peach and apple. Very dry with an exceptionally high level of carbonation that unfortunately hides some of the more dynamic flavors.

22,33,brewerburgundy,4.02,"12oz twist-off! bottle, goblet, best before 02-09-12.  Tea and shy red, amber color. Pretty active bubbles and a one inch head that verges on tan. This recedes to a healthy, slightly boastful cap. I think that this looks much like Chimay Red.  What a lovely nose full of fresh berries and dried fruits: apricots, figs, raisins, mango. Dirty straw and pear. Flowers as well. Yeast is in the background in a slightly spicy, wet leaf way.  Upon sipping this delight it springs very fizzily onto the tongue and delivers a bitter champagne experience. The fresh berries are prominent and one is aware of that candi sugar matte flavor that here is not really metallic. Juicy, juicy in a wine way. The texture and fruity flavors remind me of champagne until the hop bitterness comes into play. The yeast is subtle in this one, it seems to compound the hop bitterness and lend a clove spice that also serves to remind that this is beer. Very good beer.  I generally dislike high levels of carbonation, but this Unibroue deal is really working for me in this instance. My champagne comparison may be because I like champagne, and the bubbles certainly play to that. How about we serve Maudite at a few weddings instead of champagne?

Digging deeper a soft tobacco note emerges, topped off by the chalky, aspirin-like, (and not unpleasant) Unibroue house character.

Huge front of dark fruits and yeast. Caramel adds to the fruity sweetness and the spiciness just adds some complexity. Fantastic amounts of flavour here.  M: Medium bodied and high carbonation.

Dark fruits and a bit of spiciness...can pick up the alcohol in the nose as well...  Taste is caramel bready malt, sweet dark fruits, raisin/grapes...the initial sweetness goes away with a belgian yeast spiciness...slight burn from the alcohol and a slight hop bitterness balances the finish...  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, prickly on the tongue and lips from a combination of the spice and alcohol...

22,33,Reinheitsgebot71,4.32,"Maudite one of Canada's top ranking beers and a long standing favorite of Belgian style beer lovers and curious youths looking for a buzz beyond 40s.  Poured into my Duvel glass a rusty ruby beer, slightly hazy from the yeast, creates a luscious foaming head. White and populated by the finest of bubbles it gives it a cream in tea sort of texture when it fades. Traces of head grace the glass sides but contribute more in effervescence fine lacing.  Spice and yeast yield their pleasing scents throughout the beer but are most prominent here in the beginning. Cardamom, allspice and nutmeg mingle together in a sort of cakey contest backed by sweet malt smells. Slicing through these scents, hints of cut apples and citrus provide balance to the ample spice aromas. Further on more exotic smells manifest. Cantaloupe and grape are the more prevalent ones early in the beer then hints of guava, mango and peach give exotic air to the brew.  Bready malt mixed with clove, cocoa, cinnamon and nutmeg give a bakery feel to the flavour as if one was having some spicy confections. Hops have a surprising presence for this style, earthy herbal thyme playing along with the modest, balancing bitterness provided. Pear and star anise provide more earthy body backing up the overall earthy, spicy feel of the brew. As the beer warms poppy seed and fruit cake add yeasty malt complexity. Slight acidic sour notes of blackberry syrup mingle with the rich creamy feel of Madeira as one progresses through the drink. Bitter melted chocolate and toffee are interesting malt flavours which linger in the finish along with hints of booziness.  This is simply an amazingly complex beer, a true tribute to its Belgian progenitors. It's stood the test of time and one of the best Canada has to offer. Now to see what some aging will do to it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Probably should only have one beer at a sitting but that one beer should go down fairly smooth.  Overall, one of the better dark belgian style ales I've had for its ABV.

S- Kind of a musty almost saison type smell a little alcohol note and some dark fruit and malty aromas.  T- Nice spice tastes with some nice hops, fruits that comes through are raisin,grape and citrus.  M- Some carbonation hits the roof of the mouth a little oily feel with a nice warming back end.

He didn't pour it harshly but it ended up having a ton of head in the glass. Cool thing to see.  S - Some grapefruit and orange. Mild lemon sort of like a hefi.  T - I could swear I was drinking a 5% ABV beer! The light flavors of orange and yeasty bread hit the tongue.  M - Not really bitter at all but very nice. Goes down even though the ABV is high.  D - I would have another but the price is a ball buster at 4.00 a bottle. I would see picking up a big bottle if it was around south western PA.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Not the same beer at all but there's something similar here.  M- A bit thin to my liking. It is refreshing though. Highly carbonated. Dry finish is a bit surprising.

As soon as I popped the cap it rushed for the exit almost a tragedy.  Smell is mainly of pepper. A nice roasted malt aroma surfaces for a bit then shies away to a fruity yeasty finish.  Taste again is all peppery. Heavy fruits kick in right after the intial pepper blast. Then the spicy yeastiness takes over for the big finsh.  Mouth is full bodied with excellent carbonation on the palate.Warmness of alcohol tingles the teeth and even numbs them. Finishes dry and smooth.

22,33,Ek0nomik,3.83,"Poured In: Snifter Glass  Appearance: The pour is a dark copper and auburn color with a finger of cream colored head with a little cocoa mixed in. The beer is quite clear and quite effervescent. The head sticks around for awhile; it has better retention that I was expecting. The lace isn't to be found. After a few swirls on my snifter I just can't get anything to stick to the side of my glass.  Smell: The nose is picking up a very mellow suite of aromas. There is the common Belgian yeast aroma, some spice, a little big of red grape, and some herbal notes from the hops. It's a pleasant nose, but rather weak.  Taste: The palate starts out with some slightly toasted malts and some caramel malt. The malt flavor becomes a backbone for some spice from the Belgian yeast. The fruity notes start to come in, a result of the yeast and hops I imagine. The hop presence in all of the Unibroue's beers that I've had is more than I was expecting, but I enjoy it. Some more grapes come out, as well as some orange peel and lemon. The aftertaste brings in some grapefruit from the hops.  Mouthfeel: A medium to thin body, highly carbonated but after letting it sit for a little while the carbonation dies down and becomes much more enjoyable on the palate.  Drinkability: Another good offering from Unibroue. Can't say this was my favorite from the sampler pack I got from them, but enjoyable nonetheless. A nice combination of flavors and aroma, from herbalness to fruitiness and spiciness.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Foam slowly but surely disintegrated leaving the little craters like swiss cheese as it did. Substantial lacing pretty much fully retreats into the brew, but does leave a little beer ring action.  S: Deep, rich, oaky malt. Has a slightly sweet, and really floral hoppy note. Kind of like lavender, molasses, and bittersweet chocolate.  T: Bittersweet malty flavor. Woody and nutty. Rich and robust, and a nice hop. Really full flavor.  M: Medium texture, not too heavy/not too light. The floral notes really fill the nose and put an interesting tingle on the palette. Strong alcohol flavor, and a dry finish.  D: Sipping beer.  Great atmosphere. Really nice appearance, and a nose full of different notes and components that really balance out well.

Cork comes off with a big pop, pours dark red with an off-white head that starts out fizzy, but turns nice and fluffy after some sitting. It's nice and fluffy and retains well on further pours, the brew itself is also more of a brownish color on further pours. I'm getting apple, pear, spice in the smell. Taste is great, reminds me of a BSDA combined with a tripel. Apple, pear, raisins, sweetness, light spicy yeast, floral notes. Alcohol well-hidden.

Yeasty and spicy upfront, followed by some wheat, sweet notes of candi sugar and dark fruits which assert themselves a bit more in the taste, notes of citrus and a dry finish with some floral hops hitting the back of the palate.  Rich, full, creamy, and smooth with a nice little kick of carbonation in the middle. Alcohol content is greatly disguised, and man is this a pleasure to drink.  This is the first time I had Maudite, which is surprising because it was in front of me all of this time, but definitely won't be my last. Perfectly sweet and wonderfully complex.

22,33,climax,4,"*Sampled 2 years before ""bust buy"" date.  Poured into a snifter, Maudite turned out a cloudy chestnut brown with a slight maroon/purple hue. Head was fairly large and faded quite quickly.  Nose was crisp, clean, and smooth. I was expecting more pungency, but nonetheless it was fair and complex. Vinous pear, banana, coriander, and some spices were the main flavors.  Flavor was full of pear and brown sugarr, kept crisp by spiciness and an alcohol pinch. It was a little bit sour. Some coriander, juicy fruit, and red wine tannin were evident as well.  Feel is very crisp, the carbonation has lots of bite initially and the feel turns towards cottony/fluffy towards the end. Finish is only slightly dry and very clean.  I was expecting this one to knock my undies off. It didn't quite accomplish that but it was very good.

T - The flavor follows the nose. A very strong citric dark fruit flavor. Complex with plumb, raisin, grape, fig medley...cherry & alcohol is also balanced in evenly with the flavor in a subtle way. Fantastic beer.  M - Even carbonation, dark complex flavor with a bite, but leaves my mouth feeling cool and refreshed.  D - Love this beer. Very fine example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale.

Plenty of fruit esters and spicy phenols - clove and white pepper - and a hint of nuttiness. Hop bitterness is relatively high, complementing the spiciness of the yeast.

Looks like your typical BPA.  The nose is terrific: spices, light malts, a bit of banana and that typical Unibroue yeastiness that brings back such wonderful memories.  Goes down terrific despite the high ABV. The taste is a wonderful blend of malt, spices, tea, and some dunkelweisse usuals like banana and clove. While it's not the most complex or hearty BSDA out there, it's 'damned' delicious and easy to drink. Let this brew warm up if you can, it really opens things up.  Thick and chewy for a dark ale, drinks very much like an abbey ale.  As a friend put it, it drinks like a wine - you can almost detect tannins.

22,33,Malfunkt,4.55,"I perhaps don't have the experience some have on BA with brews. However, I would like to add my perspective on why this is such a fantastic beer.  I started drinking this beer at a young age. When all my peers where guzzling their Molson and Labatts, a few of us thought 'why not try something that has the look of lore?'. The tall, corked bottle and devilish artwork was the mark of craft I would soon discover.  At first we laughed ""you can't even see through it!"". But over the night, instead of drinking to oblivion, I found myself enjoying a beer and great conversation with friends.  For many youth, and for many of age, alcohol is strictly a drug. The cheap beers, of poor taste and chemical additives, shape such an experience. When you taste quality, you realize that effort was put into this brew - that there can be an art.  Since 1992 I've drank this on special occasion. Each time, thinking back to those days of my youth, reflecting that this was a beer that I drank for enjoyment. My tastes are now a bit more refined, yet there is still plenty to discover in this Unibroue hallmark.  Best enjoyed with a neutral palette or with hearty food.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,goldbot,4.23,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Best by 09-23-12 listed on the bottle.  A: Pours a beautiful golden brown color with a thick, bubbly, off-white head. There is a slight haze from the yeast, medium carbonation, and almost no lacing on the side of the glass.  S: Lots of bread and yeast. A bit of sour apple or other fruit aromas. Some nice spiciness - cinnamon and cloves.  T: This beer really excels here; lots of complexity. It starts off very malty - sweet and bready. There are hints of raisin, and the beer finishes with a nice spiciness of cinnamon and more clove. There is a bit of floral hoppiness which balances the flavor nicely.  M: Very crisp with a medium body.  D: This beer sits kind of heavy, although the alcohol is only slightly noticeable going down. The great taste and lighter body makes it pretty drinkable still.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Not much smell to it, a little bit of roasted malt but not much else. A bit surprised by that, I was expecting a bigger aroma.  The taste is more of the same... this doesn't have a 'Belgian Strong Dark Ale' feel to it in my opinion. It's not a bad beer by any means, just not what I expected.  Feels great in the mouth, very drinkable despite the abv. A nice interesting malty take on the style, but very nice.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The flavors are bright as well, another good beer by Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Spineypanda,4.17,"Has a golden color to it that keeps its head for a decent amount of time, and leaves very little lacing. Smells of esters, maybe a little banana but serious strong belgian smells. Tastes like some citrus but definitely has the Belgian taste the yeasts gives. Major fruits.  Nice carbonation and I would love to have another bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Mora2000,4.12,"Beer pours dark brown to red with a huge white head. The aroma is classic Belgian with some yeast, malt and candi sugar mixed in with dark fruits. Smells great. The flavor is more classic Belgian with sweet malt and fruit, mainly plums being very evident. The beer has a medium mouthfeel and is very drinkable.  I drank it as part of a beer and cheese tasting. It paired very well with the Mozzarella Company's Deep Ellum Blue Cheese.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jakeaustin,4.27,"pours a dark amber with a hefty amount of head even with the slow pour. Classic belgian yeast makes up most of the smell with a good amount of spicy fruitiness. Taste is top notch with a lot of sour apple, yeast, and maltiness. Quite a bit of carbonation on this one. Quite a bit more than I remember from the tap version. Very drinkable for the ABV. Alcohol doesn't affect the flavor too much. Solid as always from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Small, fizzy head that doesn't lace much.  S: Spicy, malty character with notes of spiced apples and brandy.  T: Malty with a fizzy mouthfeel and a spicy, almost hot finish. Definitely not for the faint of heart.  Drinkability: Goes down easy but I wouldn't have more than a couple in a sitting. 8% ABV will catch up with you fast.

22,33,vikingmike,3.53,"This was actually my first Unibroue beer ever back when I was about 18 years old. I drank a 6-pack of it, right out of the bottle, during a high school trip to Montreal. Hardly beer advocacy, but I decided to revisit it, this time with an actual glass!  A: Dark, reddish copper  S: Fruits...pear and apple mostly. standard Unibroue yeast. Slight astringency.  T: Hardly the cornucopia of flavours I expect from a Unibroue Belgian. Far less sweet than other beers of its kind. A bit of tart fruitiness.  M: Thin, watery. Much drier than I expected.  D: I love Unibroue, but this one is pretty underwhelming. It seems to be a divisive beer, with some huge advocates and others who aren't big on it. I fall into the latter category.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,drtth,4.16,"Poured into a Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: The beer pours out lighly hazed dark orange/amber color with a ½"" off-white head that recedes fairly soon leaving a ring, a patch of foam and some speckles of lacing clinging to the glass. Sipping leaves widely scattered speckles and legs of lacing clinging to the glass as the sheets of foam slide back down into the liquid. The lacing, foam ring, and patch of foam on the liquid persist throughout the beer.  Smell: The aroma is yeasty and fruity with a mixture of apples and pears backed up by some nice brown sugar or light toffee notes.  Taste: The flavor has a clean, crisp fruity and lightly spicy character mingled with some sweetness. The fruits are pears and sweet cherries and a touch of orange zest all bound up with some light toffee malt sweetness. The alcohol is well hidden in this one.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium to heavy bodied with smooth steady carbonation that tickles the tongue. The finish is quite long, losing the fruity sweet character first and then fading into a spicy almost astringent dryness.  Drinkability: No question I'll be having this one again. This is one of my favorites from Unibroue and it will be finding a place in my fridge for years to come. Even with a relatively high ABV I'm ready for another one.  19 Jun, 2014  Having a bottle that has been cellared for about 6 mos. and find that the flavors are nicely integrated and a bit more complex than I've remembered or described above. This one can definitely do well with 6 mos of bottle age and probably more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,thegodfather2701,3.74,"A-I had this at the Flying Saucer in Charlotte. It was about an eight ounce pour I believe into the proper glassware. It was deep brown in color with a nice white head that remained somewhat present throughout the experience.  S-the nose was dominated by dark fruits, brown sugar, and alcohol.  T-much like the nose the taste is dominted by dark fruits, brown sugar, and an alcohol sweetness. To my disapointment it was not very complex.  M-not as thick and creamy as expected, with a nice amount of carbonation.  D-pretty drinkable despite being a disapointment. However it's abv would deter one from drinking more than a couple in a session.  Overall this was a major disapointment for me. I have drank much better examples of the style. I will try this again on bottle form in the near future and hope for a better experience.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,whtguitarguy,4.17,"Another good brew from Unibroue. Pours to a dark reddish brown, the head is quick to fade. The aroma is reminiscent of a Belgian style witbier. Has a nose full of spiciness. The brew itself is rather alcoholic, but the flavor of alcohol isn't really there, spices are well balanced with the malts.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,AgentZero,3.93,"A - Nice brownish color that tans at the edges. Bubbly two finger head that quickly dissipated, leaving the sides of the glass clean.  S - Fruity, almost apples with a hint of pears. Nice belgian yeast smell, but a little more subtle than most belgians.  T - Apples and bears with a nice compliment of belgian yeast. Nicely fruity and sweet. Not much in the way of malts or hops.  M - Great carbonation lends a nice bite to this medium-light bodied brew. Nice substance to it.  D - Highly drinkable, although I think the sweetness would get to most after a couple.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BlackBearForge,4.2,"Maudite pours a cloudy brownish amber with a thin whitish head which falls quickly.  The aroma has a touch of alcohol with dark fruits and caramel with fresh baked bread yeastiness.  The flavor is of dark fruits, raisins and brandied apricots, with notes of pear and apple. Caramel and hints of chocolate make an appearance in the malt along with spicy yeast flavors (like cloves and pepper). The taste profile is quite dense and the alcohol is well integrated throughout.  Mouthfeel seems firmly medium, smooth with carbonation being a bit on the high side.  Maudite is a very warming brew, with flavors becoming more complex and mellow as it comes up in temperature. If those doomed canoeists were paddling home to celebrate with this beer it's no wonder they made a pact with the Devil!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Vonerichs,3.97,"My first thought in looking at this was that it was extremely flat looking. It looked like caramel in a glass due to the color and complete lack of any head.  Smells like yeast and fruity esters- sour cherries, a little apple, and a little pear all backed by toffee.  The first taste that comes to mind is apple cider vinegar, then the sour cherry. The malt gives it a nice push towards sweet, then finishes with a ginger spice.  Despite it's flat appearance, the mouthfeel was heavily carbonated and sparkling.  The alcohol is masked well and everything has a crisp taste to it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Bisho,4,"Unibroue have some great beers but I personally feel this one is a little overrated. It is let down ever so slighlty by the dry/bitter aftertaste. For a strong Dark Ale this is a little off-putting. It's more like a hybrid IPA/BSDA. Don't get me wrong, I love my IPA's but this is really neither one or the other and is lacking an identity! The bitterness in the aftertaste also become more prominent as it warms so get it down the hatch quickly! :)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MaxBrews,4.62,"355ml bottle dated for 11-27-11 poured into a 25cl chimay glass.  Maudite pours a dark brownish-orange with a very thin head that dissipates quickly. Not unusual for this type of glass. Lacing is swirly and clings to the glass.  The aroma delicate and complex. Aromas of funky farmhouse Belgian yeast, red wine vinegar, grapes, dates, and other dark pitted fruit.  Tastes of sour dark cherries, caramel, clove, and Belgian yeast, there's some hop bitterness but its well balanced with this beer's sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Medium body relaxed carbonation.  A really fantastic Belgian Strong Dark Ale. A complex flavor and aroma. Nothing astringent and nothing to really approve upon with this beer reminding me why Unibroue is a fantastic brewery. A must try if you like Beligian styles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,irishking1977,4.4,"Unibroue's beers are amazingly similar and consistent; if I were to take a blind taste test, I could probably distinguish most of the subtle flavors of a unibroue brew. Maudite (meaning ""damned"" in French) is no exception.  A: Pours a dark ruby/amber with massive two finger white/tan head. Head retention remains for some time, leaving lots of lacing. Very nice.  S: Hints of malt, pepper and spiciness along with dark fruit and candy sugar can be detected.  T: Dark candy sugar and a subtle yeast sour funkiness with malt and pepper can be tasted. The slight sour funkiness lingers at the finish of each sip. Good stuff. As good as Maudite is, it's one of my least favorite offerings of Unibroue.  M: Smooth and creamy with ample carbonation.  D: This one is a hybrid in that the ABV is relatively high, it's also hidden extremely well. It's somewhere in between a sipper and a session. Can be sipped and/or quaffed. Mind you, after 3 of these, one might want to turn in for the night. Maudite makes being damned not so bad after all.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A: pours a mahogany red brown. head is pronounced off the cuff, then vanishes to a thin lace.  S: pepper and fruity tones, yeast is present as is sweetness.

Clear, dark copper color with floating yeasties. Decent head that dissipates to a crescent shaped collar on it's way out.  Generally, yeast, fruit and spice. Specifically, Bready malt orange rind, ripe pear and cinnamon.  Taste is dominated by an aggressive, course carbonation. Orange creamsicle with cinnamon and nutmeg. Dry, husky aftertaste.

Nose has fruity notes of peach and pear with a spicy hint of cinnamon. There's something else at play here, but I can't identify it. Taste is very enjoyable - the light fruity notes come again, with generous notes of yeast and a mild spice rolls across the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium bodied wioth fairly generous carbonation, but it's not obstrusive. Alcohol is quite well hidden.  Fairly drinkable - there's really nothing to slow down your consumption.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

This is a very good beer, just like all the other beers I have had from Unibroue. Very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Arbitrator,3.56,"Chilled 12oz bottle into a Chimay chalice. Re-review. This is a 2008 bottle that is about a year old now.  A: Pours a murky mahogany body with gold and ruby highlights when held to a lamp. brown-gold with ruby around the edges when held to the light. The carbonation is respectable, but relatively tame for an Unibroue (which I've always found to be oversudsy). It's about a finger's worth of large, fluffy bubbles that retain moderately and collapse into a thick swath on top of the brew. Each swig leaves broken sheets of bubbles down the sides of the glass.  S: Yeast.... Some weak dark fruit character (plums, I guess?) and a whiff of spice. But on the whole, surprisingly unremarkable and lacking in pungency, even with vigorous agitation.  T: Great fruit character: orange, berries, cherries, and pear. A small flavor of yeast, and the finish carries hints of spice (cardamom). The malt character comes through as a toffee-caramel hybrid. But the finish is kind of watery.  M: Light-medium bodied, with ample carbonation to amplify the peppery kick in the finish. A small warmth hints at the ABV. I think the year laying down has tamed the bubbles nicely, as I usually find this beer overcarbed.  D: I think my love affair with Unibroue is drawing to a close. I respect what they do for the style, but I'm just underwhelmed lately. Maybe it's from having spent time in Belgium, maybe it's palate fatigue, maybe the bottle aged badly, maybe it's that the beers just aren't that great.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MurphyMacManus,4.6,"750mL bottle/stemless snifter  A: clear. Brown the same shade as strong tea. Off-white head without much stick, but I poured very carefully so as not to disturb yeast sediment.  S: Sweet, spicy, some fruit. Almost like some sort of holiday baked good, but without a cloying sweetness in the aroma. Warming, metaphorically. Might catch a bit of alcohol in the nose, but it's usually very well hidden.  T/M: brandied fruitcake. Slightly chewy mouthfeel cut by lively carbonation from the bottle conditioning.  D: Very smooth. Though alcohol is slightly present in aroma and flavor, it's masked and smoothed very well by the malt and the spicy Belgian yeast. Doesn't taste as strong as it is. Deceptive that way, but still highly drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Rich amber body with a large, bubbly off-white head, that recedes to a constantly replenished island of bubbles in my Duvel glass. Absolutely huge fruity (pear, lychee, peach), spicy (cinnamon) aroma. Floral, sweet flavour with strong hints of cinnamon. The fruitiness really comes through in a pleasantly sweet way. Fairly high level of carbonation, which is fine, but the body itself is a little watery.  Had this again with a couple years on it, and both the body and flavour had improved greatly. I'd probably put the body up to a 4 and the flavour to a 4.5.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

More berries fruit pop up on the tongue, adding depth, with a little blueberry and blackberry. After the fruity esters, more earthy, herbal clove notes slide in to leave a fairly balanced and dry finish. I would have like a little more complexity, but this was still a great, well-made beer.

The off-white head is a little more than two fingers tall and has good retention, but only leaves behind the occasional scrap of lacing.  The aroma has a bit of honey in it, with a variety of fruits from apple to figs. A good spiciness is there also, reminding me a bit of fennel and pepper.  The first flavors of Maudite are lighter fruits such as apple and pear, which turns into a slightly medicinal, peppery flavor. A bit of fennel is in there also, followed by some tobacco and a hint of chocolate. The dark fruit are weak in the flavor, with just a touch of prune. Underneath it all is a little bit of warming from the alcohol, but just a touch.  The mouthfeel is prety full for the style, but also high on the carbonation; two characteristics that come together to be pretty pleasant.

22,33,zoso493,4.4,"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a flute.  Appearance: Pours a very pleasant, dark mahogany with just a very slight one-finger head that doesn't stay around too long. Not much in the way of lacing either.  Smell: Very sweet malty scent. A lot of butterscotch, caramel, dark fruit and cinammon come out in the smell, but not in an overly bold way.  Taste: The taste is a lot more bold than the smell would have indicated. Really nice, sweet and almost sugary taste. Lots of dark fruit and caramel are the two main tastes that I can pick out.  Mouthfeel: Fairly medium-bodied with a nice amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Pretty nice drinking beer for being 8% ABV, but the alcohol was definitely noticeable. I still downed this one bottle pretty quickly, though.  Overall, I thought this was a very tasty beer. It's a really nice take on the style and an interest departure from similar Belgian offerings.

The taste is of dark fruits, raisins, caramel and a little toffee.  Maudite is another stellar brew from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,donniecuffs,4.52,"Poured a nice dark brown with a finger of off-white head into a snifter, with decent lacing. The smell was a nice bouquet of cocoa, molasses, brown sugar, maltiness, and tart cherry. The taste confirmed all of this, but the tartness also brought to mind some sour apple. The tartness surfaced mid-palate and stayed through the finish, which didn't taste as alcoholic (or leave warmth) like Trois Pistoles did, e.g. the alcohol content was very well disguised. The feel was a surprisingly spritzy medium body, and the balance in the flavor made me wish that I had purchased more than one bomber.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,KBomb,3.77,"Dark brown color with a hint of red blush to it, minimal head. Aroma is abundant with caramel malt sweetness, some green apple and a bit of melon. Despite all the sweetness in the nose, the tongue is overwhelmed with spice and a little astringency. Some tart and sour fruit flavors on the finish. Dry mouthfeel and effervescent carbonation. Fairly drinkable considering the ABV, doesn't feel as heavy as it is.  Taste was a little underwhelming considering the smell. Not bad, but I'm not all that interested in seeking it out again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MeisterBurger,3.94,"Pours a nice raisiny color with okay head retention. No real lacing or head retention. Kind of homely looking in the end.  The aroma is of plums and pears and juicy fruits with notes of cinnamon and spice and subtle wafts of dough and yeast.  The taste follows, with fruity (apples and pears) sugary bready sweetness, very raisiny with a hint of sweet cherries, and peppery warming spices with a buttload of phenols in the finish. Very well balanced. Very drinkable.  The mouthfeel is a tad on the watery side. A bit of a let down, actually, but nicely tangy.  Yet another winner from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,heissebier,4.43,"Poured from a bottle into a goblet. Scary bottle with some people paddling a canoe through the sky and a devil. The beer means damned so I guess I get why the devil's there, but the canoe thing I'm still a little confused on. Freshness date of 9/18/10.  Appearance- Creamy amber-caramel color. Cloudy and mysterious, but with a disappointing off-white head that clings to the side of the glass.  Smell- Glorious. If you took all the best smells in the world and combined them, this is what you would get. Fruity and peppery, along with a little hoppiness. No hint of 8% abv.  Taste- Does not disappoint. Malty, but it's the mix of fruit and peppers that I really notice. This is the kind of beer that you could drink over and over again, each time noticing a different flavor.  Mouthfeel- A little champaign like for this Beer Advocate. On the heavy side, with an unusual, slightly effervescent carbonation.  Drinkability- Excellent! Barely a hint of its high abv. Something about this beer leaves me wanting more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Whiteweasel,4.24,"Poured from a bottle into a goblet. Freshness date: 09-18-11  Appearance: A reddish amber colour. Deep orange when held up to the light. Head is thin and champagne-like, settling on the sides of the glass after quickly dissipating. Carbonation sneaks up the side as it sits.  Smell: Rich and peppery, with a distinctive Unibroue yeast taste. Smells a lot like tropical fruit. Very delicious. Gets even better as it warms up in the glass.  Taste: So smooth and complex. Many different complimenting flavours all rolled into one. Perky fruit flavour with accenting peppery notes. Has a characteristic Unibroue yeastiness, which I don't enjoy as much as other belgian yeasts, but its not too prominant in this brew. Certainly nuttiness, but also a little bitterness from something i can't quite put my finger on. I'm getting something almost like gingerbread  Mouthfeel: You can't necessarily taste the alcohol but you can feel it. Much smoother than the other Unibroues; I love it. Carbonation is a little like that of champagne, but not quite as pronounced in your mouth.  Drinkability: Gloriously drinkable. Dark and mysterious, but still light enough where I want another (few) afterwards. The alcohol would probably be an issue after a few, but before then who cares?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jbonapar,4.62,"My favorite of the Unibroue beers. QUebec without a doubt has some of the best beers in North America.  Smells of Sweet Plums with sugary overtones. Rich flavor of brown surar, spice and fruit that is unbelievably warming. A hint of bitterness at the finish. Some vinella and banana for good measure.  A full beer that is to be enjoyed and not chugged!  Fantastic.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,kirok1999,3.68,"Pours a dark amber, a hint of a wispy white head. Lots in the smell...caramel sweetness, plums, raisins, mixed spices. Tastes much like the smell, a hint of smoke, dark Belgian yeasts, cherries, spices of cinnamon, corriander and clove. A very dense brew, thick and rich and easy to sip. Definitely a complex brew but not one I would choose on a regular basis.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,vishneda,4.28,"Had this one a few times and the review I had got wiped out during one of the crashes so I am re-entering it.  12 oz bottle poured into a chalice to a nice dark red color. A little too red to be called brown, but in that general area. The head was very thin and tan. The beer presented a lot of lacing.  The aroma was a mixture of dark fruits like plums or prunes along with some brown sugar. Very sweet smelling which is great of the style but maybe a tad muted. The flavor, however, is not muted. It's a great blend of spices and fruits with some bitterness to balance the experience. The front is a sweet and spicy mix that is maybe a little tart. I sensed hints of cinnamon, dark fruits, cherries, banana, and maybe some vanilla. A light dark chocolate comes into play toward the finish.  The body of this beer is huge. Nice and full. Very drinkable for a big beer, but definitely one you should sip.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Nicely mixed with some spiciness and fruit flavors, very drinkable and easy to top off a 750 ml on a sunday afternoon with football. First Unibroue I have tasted, curious to see how the others differ in taste",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MrDanno96,4.23,"Big 750 ml bottle from 2008.  A: Pours a dark amber/orange color that lets in very little light. Initially poured over 2 fingers of head and retains a full finger after several minutes. Lots of foamy, sticky lacing. Fair amount of sediment on the bottom as well.  S: Lots of fruity esters: I get mostly cherries and bananas. Also some alcohol and sweet malts.  T: Nice roasted/caramel malts up front give way to some sweet fruits: raisins, cherries, sherry. Very subtle hops finish that you can feel on the sides of your tongue. Alcohol is definitely apparent, but blends nicely with the other flavors. Very complex, very nice.  M: Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Some alcohol warming at the back of the throat and in your chest.  D: The complexity and abv of this beer lends it much more to sipping than sessioning. If you like this style you could probably enjoy a big bottle of this for most of the evening. A very good example of the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Actualimeer,4.38,"At first sniff I noticed a medley of spices and a sweet smell that made me think of mead. It was served to me in a large fish bowl of a glass. The head was thick, but not especially so. The flavor really did make me think of mead well I drunk it. Its appearance was dark and clear until tipping the last third of the bottle into the glass. Then it was a little cloudy and the flavor was richer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,steelerguy,4.03,"A - Huge just off-white head with LOTS of carbonation. Looking through the beer is like looking at carbonated wildflower honey, dark gold, slightly hazy, and makes me want a taste!  S - Very spicy aroma with banana like esters.  T - The smell translates to the taste, spicy, lots of esters, with a definite Belgian ""twang"". Ends with some sweet caramel malts and alcohol.  M - Finishes pretty dry, but I think this may have more to do with the alcohol warmth and extreme carbonation. I like it but I can see how it could be distracting.  D - The crisp and light finish make this a drinkable beer. 750 ml is not a chore, but would not want anymore.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,rhollman,3.4,Appearance - Hazy mahogany brown describes it well  Smell - Spicy aroma  Taste - Complex burst of flavor and nice hop finish  Mouth Feel - Crisp and tangy/spicy  Drinkability - To me the flavor is similar to a dubbel.

Like most Unibroue, very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,craftaholic,4.11,"Appearance: Poured from a 750 into a snifter. The color was a deep amber mahogany/ steeped black tea hue and had a whopping pure white, frothy, 3 finger length head that hung around for quite a while. Not much lacing but it really was a beautiful pour.  Smell: It smells very spicy and peppery, and even hints of clove. There is a doughy yeast that acts as a backbone and even some touches of alcohol. There is also some nuances of sweet red fruits with some honey mixed in.  Taste: Has a variety of grains and nuances of florals and fruits. The doughy yeast that is expected with the belgian title is a strong character here. A spicy pepper rears its head and adds itself to the list of complexities. Towards the end the yeast turns into a crisp and tart apple-esq sweetness mixed with a bit of woody touches.  Mouthfeel: Zesty and creamy as the froth bubbles across the palate. Its quite robust but the effervescence tames it nicely.  Drinkability: Drinking is no chore unless you aren't a fan of yeast backbones (but why are you drinking it then). For such an aggressive style it drinks like a dream.  Overall: This is quite a great brew that combines the tremendous amount of complexities from herb and spice to tart and sweet and rounds it out with astringent and yeast. Its obviously not as 'true to style' as it could but to that I say ""drink outside the style"". Enjoy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The smell is a light hint of malts, and is not very strong, nevertheless its enticing. Taste is a light malt, with a nice malty finish. What really sets this apart is the mouthfeel and drinkability. The carbonation of thick beer makes the beer feel very nice, and despite the high abv, one could drink this all night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

T: Rich fruity malts are th dominant flavor in the beer mixed in a with faint herbal taste and powerful Belgian spices. Caramel is also present along with fresh fruit.  M: Highly carbonated and creamy the alcohol makes this beer a bit lighter in body than i would have expected and keeps the brew interesting warming as it goes down  D: For a beer that is 8% alc this beer is extremely drinkable i could drink this all night until i passed out at 10 'o clock,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smells of sweet red fruit, with big sweet honeyed biscuit and some black pepper and cloves.  Spiced apples over sweet, bready malts gives way to dates, carmel, and mild hop bitterness. There's a warming alcohol presence on the back end. Full-bodied with moderate levels of carbonation. Good alcohol masking for the style.  Great drinkability for the style. Slightly lower ABV and great depth aside, this is a sipper for most folks. I'd slap someone for pounding a pint of this ambrosia without savoring it. A big beer, and a great beer.

It smells of sweet dark bread and dried fruit with a hint of caramel, almost like a fruitcake aroma. It's mildly boozy. The dried fruit and caramel are there up front on the palate too, followed by some herbal and peppery spice flavours in the middle. It gets a little bit woody in the finish. Alcohol is slightly warming - just enough to remind you of the flames licking your paddle. This robust ale is lightened somewhat by it's effervescence. The peppery carbonation works well with the herb and spice flavours found in this delicious brew. The alcohol is well hidden, and polishing off a 750mL bottle of this is no chore.

22,33,jmalex,4.11,"While drinking this, I recommend that everyone read the story of the Chasse-galerie to get an idea of what this badass label artwork is all about.  APPEARANCE: Pours into my Delirium tulip a hazy, ruddy brown. A large, light tan head forms on top with some really small, tight bubbles. It holds really steady barely dropping at all. Impressive.  SMELL: The aroma is signature Unibroue with their big, bready yeast profile. Fruitiness is a little low with more light fruit and citrus than any of the darker types. The yeast also gives off a slight spicy (coriander?) component to the beer as well. There is no boozy alcohol to speak of.  TASTE: Light, sweet, and mildly fruity. Again, it's completely yeast-driven and derives nearly all its character from it. The breadiness continues before a dry bitterness leads you out. It seems so simple but complex at the same time.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium light bodied with a great dryness to it. The carbonation is high, only helping to diffuse the robust flavors a bit more.  DRINKABILITY: Really great as most Unibroue beers are. It's so rich and is such an aggressive style, yet the beer feels tremendously light and disappears really quickly. Plus you'd never know there was any alcohol in here let alone 8%. Really, really good.  A classic ale from a classic brewery. They were one of my introductions to craft beer, and I suspect they continue to draw in many drinkers. With a label like that, it's no surprise.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,fropones,3.95,"Poured a dark copper amber brown with a 1 finger head that dissipated quickly. The smell was of malt, spice, dark fruits, and alcohol.

Sort of a sipper; even though you couldn't taste the alcohol that much, it was still a pretty heavy beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,flagmantho,4.1,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a wine goblet.  Appearance: deep, cloudy copper color with a 1-finger creamy foam head.  Smell: tangy apple and some yeastiness right off the bat.

Not a lot of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: deliciously creamy. Love these bottle-conditioned beers.  Drinkability: quite drinkable, but some of the tart/astringent qualities have a cumulative effect as I drink, which is not wholly conducive to drinkability.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Soneast,3.93,"Pours a hazy orange to brownish color (the aged penny analogy is sound) with a 3 finger thick off-white colored head that forms a very dense mat of bubbles, very slowly receding to about a 1/4 inch layer of cream.  Aroma: Quite a bit of fresh baked bread on the nose, along with some dark fruits and a nice spiciness throughout.  The flavor is quite unique. Initially it has a fresh, sparkling grape or maybe green apple flavor, not the dark fruits I was expecting, although as it warms it a more ""black cherry"" flavor seems to come out. Also some spice on the tongue as well as a sort of subdued toffee flavor. A nice earthy backdrop that helps to mellow the flavors and very little alcohol detected.  This isn't quite as complex as a true & blue Belgian brew and feels a tad light in comparison, however a very satisfying experience and mayhaps the best attempt I've seen from a non-Belgian brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Big head during the pour that quickly fades to a floating rim.  Smell: Dark fruits and breadyness. Smell's great while the head is still around but it quickly fades away with the head. I didn't detect the alcohol scent that many seem to.  Taste: Very sweet dark fruits are most noticable. A little bit of that lip-puckering tangyness that you find with most Belgian darks. I think it has a plum taste to it that I've never got from a beer before. Finish is that nice bready yeast and a very little hint of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Highly carbonated. Crisp as opposed to smooth. Very dry.  Drinkability: Well I'm going to finish off the rest of my 750, but this is something I think would best be shared with another person. It is a sipper for sure.  Overall: This could easily be a staple ""dinner beer"". I think it would be great with many things, steak and baked chicken come to mind. I paired my second glass with some very sharp cheddar and it was great.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

This is my first Belgian style brew that I'm reviewing  A: The head goes on for days with this one during the pour. The color is a dark copper tone. Very nice looking.  S: Smell is of bread, very sweet bread with some dark fruit coming through. There's a bit of alcohol in there as well.  T: The taste of this comes through as raisins, perhaps even chocolate and some other dark tones in the brew.  M: Mouthfeel is pretty heavy in my opinion. Not in a bad way though.

T&M - Great Belgian yeast flavor up front with high carbonation on the tongue. Followed quickly by the wheat bread and caramel malts. Some nice spiciness to this that I can't put my finger on. Alcohol plays a nice role at the end and is spicy and sweet. Smooth taste and well-balanced flavors.  D - I could sip this all night. Not overly sweet but enough there to make this very tasty. Carbonation is high but in a pleasing way.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Looks really good, but doesn't look like a dark beer of any kind. That's not really Unibroue's fault though.  Smell: Spice. More spice. Some sweet and a little dark fruit too. A little swirl lets loose the Unibroue yeast smell, which is nice. There's a lot going on here.  Taste: Not only does it not look like a dark beer, it also doesnt taste like my favorite Belgian darks. It tastes light and refreshing. However, it tastes incredible. Extremely complex-- spice, sweet-tart (tangy?) fruit, nice balancing bitterness, long yeasty finish. Just great.  Mouthfeel: Very bubbly effervescence, almost like champagne. Tingly on the tongue.  Drinkability: Excellent beer, but not an excellent Belgian dark. It is very complex, but too light and crisp. Extremely enjoyable if you know what you're getting into.

22,33,PerroGrande,4.23,"Appearance: Pours to a hazy, brownish/red cider color. Produced a solid amount of tan foam, that laced out gently as the beer got to breathe. Very pleasing appearance.  Smell: I certainly detected some alcohol in the aroma of this beer. Hint of cloves, too. This beer does not have a pronounced aroma.  Taste: To me, it opens with a hint of green apple and light alcohol taste. A nicely balanced, smooth malt appears next. There is a lot of complexity behind the scenes here, and I admit to not being able to pick up all the subtleties. The flavor is pleasing, balanced and not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Slight zip at the beginning, followed by a smooth finish. Carbonation is present but nicely balanced. There is, to me, an ""alcohol warmth"" following.  Drinkability: This slips down nicely for an 8.0 ABV brew, and I could definitely drink several of these without issue. I am, however, not a big fan of noticeable alcohol taste, so for me, this was a detraction.  Very nice beer, well crafted, interesting and complex - yet subtle enough to be smooth and drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,civilizedpsycho,4.75,"Poured bottle into glass.  Appearance: Pours a very dark, amber color that is very difficult to see through as it's somewhat cloudy. Got a 1-finger head that lasted for a little bit.  Smell: Sweet smell reminiscent of a hefeweizen. There are hints of banana and spices, but they don't dominate the smell. It's mostly the sweet yeast and malt aromas that are quite pleasing to the nose.  Taste: Amazing. Sweet all the way through without being too rich or fruity. There are light hints of banana and clove, and perhaps some other fruit or spices that I couldn't quite identify, but they are hidden nicely. Very smooth.  Mouthfeel: A fair body from the carbonation and yeast, but not thick or creamy in texture.  Drinkability: I found this beer to be simply fantastic. I had bought a variety pack from Unibroue. This was the first one I tried and I wished that instead of the variety pack, I had bought a pack of this. If that's not a 5 for drinkability, I don't know what is.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,hdofu,4.45,Deep ruby with a tan head. Smells quite a bit like a cider but it certainly didn't taste like one. It had a taste more belgian in nature with that strong taste of coriander to match. Had a smooth mouthfeel and went down very easy. Was very easy to drink and I could easily have drank another one or two.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,OnThenIn,3.77,"Appearance: Poured into my DFH snifter with a two finger slightly tan head. It pours a very hazy dark brown, which appears a great deal more copper when looked at in the light. The head dissipates quickly.  Smell: This beer has that similar yeasty smell I have come to expect from Unibroue. The nose hits you with banana, clove, and spices right up front. This is quickly followed by some toffee and malt sweetness. There is definitely a fruit aroma to this beer.  Taste: This beers focal point seems to be the yeasty bready flavored with some fruits and some hop bitterness. There is a hint of spices here, especially in the finish. The raisin and plum flavor really shines in this beer, especially when it warms up. There is a good deal of the alcoholic warmth here, which seems pretty par the course for a good deal of the Unibroue beers.  Mouthfeel: Very carbonated is what initially comes to mind. Personally, I thought it was a bit too carbonated and gave the beer a little bit of a prickly bite. The body was a little bit of on thin side of medium when not counting in the carbonation, which was somewhat disappointing. The carbonation bumped the overall body up to a medium bodied beer. This has a dry finish that had a bit of a spice kick to it.  Drinkability: I was put off with what seemed to be too much carbonation on a bigger beer. Unlike Trois Pistoles, I have trouble finishing a 750 of this beer. I doubt I will buy this again because it seems like there are many other BSDAs or even other Unibroue beers that I would immediately pick up over this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ToddT,4.33,"A- Hazy medium brown tinted with ruby highlights and a large beige head. Head diminishes quickly to a ring but leaves no lace on the glass.  S- Candied fruits, raisin, fig, banana, toffee, clove, spice, and caramel. Subdued aroma in spite of all the complexity in it.  T- More malt that fruit, although the fruit shows through with its sweetness. Clove and spice make an appearance in the middle followed by a bit of sour Belgian funk. Finish is bone dry with a warming effect of the alcohol.  M- Medium in body but carbonation seems a little low. Very dry finish with a lingering final note of hops and funky yeast.  D- Very complex but very drinkable. Would not want to session this but more than one is alright. The 8.0% ABV shows up a little in the heat of the finish.  This is one of the most complex beers I have ever had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ADZA,4.35,"This beer pours a dark ruby colour with avid carbonation that leaves a nice frothy two finger head,it has aromas of apricots,plums and fruity yeast,this is such a unique tasting beer definately so unique it has tastes of bananna,butterscotch and apricots covered in coconut with an above average mouthfeel,i must admit its not a beer id drink all the time but i will buy it again and easily finished the bottle without noticing its high ABV and was very impressed by it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Gosox8787,4.42,"Recieved a 750 mL bottle as part of my birthday present. Poured from the bottle into a glass in two parts. Appearance is light brown to red and hazy with a one finger head. The smell is apple, dark fruit, and clove. The taste hits with the same notes. Apple and dark fruit notes provide a solid, full sweetness. There also is some caramel notes that blend in nicely. Clove notes also are present. More and more throughout the beer hop bitterness presents itself to balance against all the sweet notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice bite of carbonation. Drinkability is great considering the ABV. The flavor doesn't wear thin at all.  Overall, a great offering from Unibroue. Big flavors and great balance make this beer a standout.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Tolnik,4.12,This darker brown beer was poured into a pint glass. When first opening the bottle the bottle was more active then typical brews from the brewery that I have noticed. The taste of a malty alcohol taste fills the mouth first following with a brown sugar and caramel.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jbphoto88,4.23,"A deep mahogany brew almost the same color as the large bottle it came corked and caged in. A sand colored head forms fast but fades just as quickly. Not much left after the aggressive start except a thin wisp of bubbles clinging to one side of the glass.  Smell is a fruity mix of sweet and sour. Crisp apple scent with a spicy hint of peppery yeast. A distinct Belgian yeast scent as expected from a strong dark ale.  Taste is more malty then fruity. Clean and rich flavor is smoky, caramelized and bready mixed with a little chocolate and some peppery yeast. Lots of flavors, layered on top of each other. Brilliant taste that I don't see ever getting tired of.  The mouthfeel is creamy and very satisfying. The sweet malts coat the palate and subside to a light baked apple taste. A light carbonation compliments the beers spice with it's fine champagne like bubbles. A finish that is warm, earthy and full of awesome kick ass-ness! A damn fine brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,tattooed81,4.11,"Poured into a tulip glass this beer was a rich amber red color with a delicate foam head that disappeared quickly.

Spices and fruit come out with hints of clove, and berries.  T: Sweet at first. Hops are present but barely. Spices and fruits, coriander and clove come out toward the end. Spicy aftertaste.  M: Smooth & well-carb'ed. Champagne-like.  D: Fantastic. I could've sipped this all night long.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,THEMGG,4.82,"A - Pours up two fingers of head, lace is thick and clingy, this looks like a belgian. Colour is orange to copper with some small bits of yeast hanging out.  S - Mega bready malts, with ripe, fruity overtones. I am getting subtle spices coming through as well.  T - Goddamn, I love this beer. Bread, cake, yeast are all up front for a second or two then its fruits and spices, plums, raisins, pepper. Hop bitterness comes through at the end which makes me want dive in again and again. Warmth is present, but the alcohol is completley masked.  M - Smooth and rich, yet not overly filling, a perfect balance of sweet and bitter.  D - I can't get enough of it. I have drank so much of this over the years and it still remains one of my number one choices. This is a beer that I will never get tired of.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Notes of black cherry, toffee, and a hint of funky acidity.  T - Very malty, mostly caramel with some toffee and fruity yeast. Develops some spicy clove and cinnamon notes in the middle before returning to a muddy, brown malt flavor that dominates the finish along with light chocolate.  M - Medium-heavy body, moderately high carbonation, and a dry finish.  D - It has been a couple of years since I last had this beer, and I remember it being a lot better than it is. The malt flavors are muddy and indistinct and the yeast is kind of one dimensional. Not awful, but a bit disappointing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,infi,4,"Poured into a snifter.  Pours a hazy and cloudy brownish/dark-red pour with a thin bubbly white head that stays for a couple minutes, before just becoming a cap on top. The smell is very malty and full of dark fruitiness, with hints of fig and dark cherries with some brown sugar. As it warms, the alcohol scent and a sort of spiciness, like a cinnamon, becomes detectable. The taste is full of the fruits with a slight breadiness from the malt and yeast. At 8%, the alcohol can be tasted pretty easily. The mouthfeel is smooth and light; not much carbonation going on throughout the ale. There is a tiny bit of bitterness that coats the tongue, but not one that is overpowering. And to end it all, the alcohol warmth comes in. This a pretty tasty beer - another Belgian Strong Dark Ale to take into consideration.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bluemoonswoon,4.49,"12oz bottle poured into my seldom used Duvel glass.  A: Quite a fizzy head, about an inch thick and the color of a sandy beach on a cloudy day, a muted kind of color. Russet amber, cloudy. Head fades in a minute or two, leaving behind a thin cap, still remains to be seen if it will leave some lacing.  S: Smell is wonderfully powerful, almost knocks you over with an incredibly fruity sweetness, apples, berries, crusty sweet bread, bing cherries. This is amazing. Hard to imagine how to improve on this.  T/MF: Mmmmmalty, fruity mixed with a slight bit of chocolate drying alcoholic finish. The complexity of this beer is remarkable, the flavors escape me, can't really put my finger on more than generalities, suffice to say it's one of the best representations of the style I have had in a long time. Mouthfeel is sharp, I wouldn't say chewy but full bodied, bubbly but not too bubbly where heartburn is a risk.  D: Wonderful beer, excellent balance, alcohol is an afterthought, could knock back a few of these without thinking because they are just that tasty.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheTrevor,4.18,"This beer poured a dark cloudy tan with a single-finger head. The smell is a mix of malt with a splash of spices and some yeastiness in the background. The taste is hugely complex without being overwhelming. There's an ethereal alternating fruitiness and spice that's difficult to put my finger on or call out as specific flavors that accurately describe it. It's also worth noting that even though this beer weighs in at 8% I was barely able to detect any alcohol at all. The mouthfeel is thick and almost chewy with a decent amount of carbonation. I had no problem with drinking this beer, I expected it to sit heavier than it did. This is a great beer, the priced kept me away for a little while but I'm glad I decided to treat myself.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,twiggamortis420,4.14,"Pours a somewhat clear amber color with a frothy tan head that conglomerates into large swiss-cheese looking pockets and collapses the head rather quickly and loudly.  Spicy, yeasty and fruity. There is a sweet bready character to it, almost like glazed doughnuts. Cinnamon and strawberries over a vanilla custard. Plenty going on here and it is quite a pleasure to sniff upon.  Yeasty, doughy flavors stand out the most with equal parts of berry fruitiness and hop bitterness. Malts are somewhat cola tasting with a bit of alcohol astringency. There are some toasty and roasty notes hidden in there and come out a bit as it nears room temp. This one probably makes it into my top 5 Unibrou beers, very good beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,joshuadlight,3.43,"First tasting of Maudite. Brownish red with a quickly evaporating and loose head. Smells of tart cherries and sugary leather. Earthy notes in the taste with some spice, corriander to be specific. A little watery for the style, but the color is a light for the style, so maybe this is an in between Belgian. I can taste and feel the alcohol, reducing the drinkability. I have a Trois Pistoles in the fridge and I have never had that beer either. I hope that it tops this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Seanstoppable,3.98,"A coworker of mine has mentioned Maudite a few times, expressing its awesomeness. He had originally said he was picking me up a bottle to sample, but upon seeing it in stores, I decided to take sampling into my own hands.  Pouring into an oversized wine glass resulted in a hazy brown with a finger of quickly evaporating head.  Smell is a subtle, but almost non-existent maltiness and a touch of spice. No indication whatsoever of its 8% ABV.  Taste is subtly malty. Alcohol is a bit more apparent, but still quite masked (I wouldn't guess it was 8%). Some other flavors that I can't quite put my tongue on. Finishes with a slight hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is a bit thick, with some chewiness around the swallow. More carbonation than your average beer. But smooth overall and very drinkable. Again, I wouldn't have guessed that this was 8% ABV.  Maybe not quite as amazing as my coworker had made me believe, but still quite good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,kegger22,3.8,"I tried about 1/2 in a snifter and 1/2 in a pilsner glass. I greatly preferred it in the pilsner. Poured a dirty brown with a large head. The head stayed throughout the drink. Aroma of dark fruits. In the snifter, everything was overwhelmed by the carbonation as beer turned to foam as it hit my mouth. If I had drank this entirely out of a snifter, I would have rated it about 2.5. In a glass, I tasted plums and cola. Feel, nothing but carbonation in the snifter, nothing special in the glass. Good drinkability, only in the glass. Maudite is remarkable similar to Trappistes Rochefort 8, which I was not overly impressed with. I give Maudite an extra tenth of a point because it's price is less unreasonable. Unfair, I know, but don't care.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

M: Crisp, and unsurprisingly for a Unibroue brew, moderately high carbonation. Medium feel. Very slight alcohol warming.  D: Excellent.

Taste reveals a lot of fruit and spice. Some definite pear notes come out along with hints of orange, some yeast and cloves. A slight underlying caramel sweetness also comes out in the finish.  Medium bodied, possibly just a little overcarbonated. The alcohol really isn't noticeable at all. Overall, this is a very nice offering from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,JRed,3.48,"Orange-copper-reddish body with white frothy head. Strong aroma of booze, tart, burnt sugar. Flavors of sugar, light fruits, tart, booze, and sour notes.

Not much of a pleasant taste combines with a weak drinkability.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,gfreed,4.22,"Highly drinkable, yet with an 8% ABV I expected a bit more punch. Instead I felt almost no alcohol, which was probably for the best, anyhow. The head hung around all too briefly, which was another surprise: in this style I think I've seen better. But these are piddly concerns. The aroma is thick with yeast, orange and apricots, and the taste hits hard with all kinds of things: malt, fruit, bread, even a few mushrooms. Dense body, cloudy orangish in color and lightly fizzed. There was a bit of lemon at the back but otherwise very little hop taste. Worth the price in any size.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jdg204,4.6,"3rd offering from the great night at Porters Pub in Easton, PA. This was the last brew on the list for my buddy, so it was pretty cool seeing him awarded with his mug. Plus, I was jacked to try a brew of this reputation.  A: Pours a cloudy copper body with a modest head that quickly declines with some splashy lacing.  S: Rich caramel malt aromas waft up from the gless, the yeast strain just smells like wonderful freshly baked sticky buns.  T: Caramel and pears followed a nice complex balancing bitterness that is a bit grainy. The finish has a very nice lingering sweetness balanced with a light hoppy underton.  M: Somewhat heavy bodied, with prickly carbonation remaining.  D: My second Unibroue of the night (La Fin) and they're officially 2 for 2 in my book (I'm a fan!). This was my favorite of the two and out of the 4 or 5 I've tried, the best BSDA I've tried. This is a classic brew; amazing balance, smooth drinkability (even with a high ABV), and a great flavor/ aroma. Try this brew, I cannot recommend it highly enough!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,beveritt,4.12,"Presentation: Poured from a 750 ml brown bottle into a sampling glass. this bottle is probably about 6 month sold. I also sampled it alongside a bottle that said best by 2004. Depending on wheter they use a 3 or 5 year shelf life, that puts it at 8-10 years old.  Appearance: Pours with 1 finger of medium tan had. This settles to a ring around the glass and a few random islands of foam. The beer itself is dark brown with hints of red.  Smell: Tart and sweet malt. Hints of lemon and peaches.  Taste: Sweet caramel malt with a slight sourness. Fruity in the middle with hints of orange and lemon zest. Mild bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Average to average plus carbonation level. Body is good.  Drinkability: An infinitely drinkable beer. Complex and flavorful.  Aged version: The older bottle was definitely past its prime. All bitterness and harsh edges had disappeared, leaving a very fruity beer with a creamy mouthfeel. However, it lacked depth and complexity.

My Maudite didn't smell too fruity, the smell was sort of forgettable. But, yummy! it tasted fruity, but not too sweet. Goes down dry, perfectly carbonated to the finish. A bitter ending.

22,33,ClevoPiwo,4.25,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.  this beer poured a dark amber or dark copper color with a finger width head that did not stay terribly long. the carbonation made the head seem a little fizzy. after a few seconds the finger width head dissipated into a fizz around the edge of the glass and was gone before the beer was through. there was a small amount of yeast sediment in the glass as well, hence ""ale on lees"".  the smell is very complex, yet balanced; no one scent overwhelmed the nose, instead it presented an array of smells ranging from a bread-like yeast and fruit to hints of spice and caramel malt. strong hints of yeast and fruit with a hint of spice seemed to linger the longest.  the taste was good with a quick tingle from the carbonation from the tongue that gave way to a multitude of flavors including yeast, fruit and a bit of malt as well. there is a hint of hops, but this is quickly overtaken by the yeast and fruit with a spicy undertone that is hard to assess but is definitely present. as the beer warmed the spices gave way a bit to a more sweet malty flavor, but this did not overwhelm or change the overall character of the beer dramatically.  the carbonation is not over the top but is enough to tingle the tongue and make itself noticed. after the carbonation dissipates from the mouth the beer leaves a smooth mouth feel and a mild warmth upon swallowing.  very drinkable. definitely a heavier belgian beer, but not too heavy or overwhelming. it has a full body, as could be expected from a strong, dark ale but it is not overpowering or chewy. on the contrary, despite its full body it still retains a very drinkable crisp character. a very good beer, one of my favorites!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Ralphus,3.68,"This beer will always remind me of my coworker Chris and his thoughts on Unibroue beers: ""Any beer with the devil and a flying canoe on it is not something I want to drink! And their other beer, The End of the World? I mean C'mon!"" But despite his thoughts on their choice of marketing I know he secretly likes Maudite, if only in the smaller bottles that don't contain as much yeast.  My bottle is the readily available 750ml variety with a cork. And even though I'm not a very big fan of Belgians, I appreciate the fact that the some French Canadians have done a very good job imitating their styles. Anyway, on with the review.  It pours a brownish ruby red. The slightly offwhite head is made of large carbonated bubbles but manages to blanket the drink all the way to the bottom. In the smell we find some sweetness, yeastiness cinnamon and nutmeg. It's instantly detectable as a belgian style beer. The taste is similar.. sweetness initially, some spice and a mild hoppyness towards the back. The alcohol and yeast are both present.  Mouthfeel is fairly carbonated and drinkability slightly better than average. Despite its strength it goes down fairly quick but that doesn't mean uncorking another is on the agenda.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BBThunderbolt,3.88,"Served in tulip. Poured a rich, ruby-brown color that featured over an inch of pretty tan head that left minimal lacing.  A rich malty aroma also featured hints of fruit in the nose. The flavor profile was also as expected with the cherry and plum notes mingling well with the malt foundation.  The body was full and solid while being well-rounded. This beer is smooth and easy to drink, despite it's strength. A very good version of the style, worth seeking out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,biboergosum,4.05,"750ml bottle. Gotta love the 'voyage of the damned' label iconography.  This beer pours a hazy, murky, and dark rusty orange-brick amber hue, with two fingers of puffy, tightly foamy, and somewhat creamy beige head, which leaves some violent swaths of chunky seaspray lace around the glass as it slowly recedes.  It smells of dense, lush, and dark musty fruit (plums and overripe apples, mostly), Belgian yeast, bready caramel malt, black pepper and nutmeg spice, brown sugar, and a twinge of warming alcohol. The taste is quite in line, with more sweet bready caramel malt, integrated yeast, sassy baked apples, some ethereal savoury spices, very tame earthy hops, and a burgeoning, but still throttled booziness.  The carbonation is duly present, but quite soft in its lilting frothiness, the body a decent medium weight, nice and full, pleasantly smooth, and maybe even a tad creamy. It finishes a bit on the sweet side, with the caramel malt, yeasty fruitiness, and compliant spice.  A decently balanced strong Belgian-style ale, with the elevated ABV very evenly applied, and hidden in most respects; one of my favourites from Unibroue. And 'damned' am I if I drink this whole bottle - good thing my better half is a fan of this offering as well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,sweetbrew82,4.12,"750 ML bottle into a snifter/ Best Before date of 11-10-11  P: Extremely dark copper with a huge, healthy head of soapy, tan-colored foam. It was comprised of medium-sized bubbles, and had kind of a champagne quality to it. Showed good retention, but didn't leave quite as much lace as I expected.  A: While Maudite's aroma doesn't put the pedal to the medal like some of the best BSDA's out there, it's still pretty nice. Toasted malts, a mixture of some light and dark fruits, tons of spice, and that signature Unibroue yeast.  T: Toasted caramel malt sets the tone right from the beginning. It lays down a sweet, bready foundation for the fruits to come and build upon, while the spices work their tongue-tingling magic. The fruits consist of pears, pink apples, plums, and a slight tinge of fig. I'm not quite sure of its origins, but I'm convinced that the noticeable hop bitterness is producing a citrus flavor that I'm picking up in there as well. All of this is accompanied by a spicy kick that tastes, predominantly, like clove and pepper. It attacks the palate early, then seems to subside, only to hit you with another helping right before swallow. Also noted is some sweet & sticky, although subtle, toffee mixed in for good measure. Nice complexity!  M: Medium-bodied with a luxuriously crisp, richly intense, prickly mouthfeel that, somehow, manages to maintain some slightl creaminess and chewiness underneath the aggressive carbonation. Not as good as some of the best Belgians, mainly because (like almost every Unibroue offering I've had) it is way over-carbonated, to the point that it almost overpowers the flavors. I have to dock points for this because it hurts the overall experience for me. Although, it is much better once it reaches room temperature.  Notes: This is another very good, complex brew from a world-class brewery. I absolutely love the intensely spicy kick on top of the rich malts, and delicious fruits. Still, it can't quite hold its weight amongst the best of this hotly-contested category, in my humble opinion. Still, it deserves to be regarded as a grade ""A"" beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dEM1972,4.5,"Malty with fruity infusions, has the distinctive aroma of a strong malted beer Slightly cloudy, pale brown, little or no head, some traces of carbonation Malted lightly toasted, a little fruity towards the end of the taste; complex and simple at the same time, has some spicy infusions in there. Smooth, very smooth; full bodied, strong; aftertaste if quite strong",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,cavedave,4.57,"Pours a semi-cloudy amber-brown topped with a finger high head of beige foam that dissipates languidly to a thick skin. It is a very thick and alive look, quite tempting.  The smell is wonderful, more than my palate can decipher, there are spicy notes in there I can't get. It's a thick aroma containing candy, alcohol, peaches, lighter floral notes, still lighter herbal and fruity notes which add complexity and balance, and for which I can offer no insight other than to say it is hard to get my nose from the snifter.  The taste... mon dieu, c'est magnifique... it is so yummy it has gotten me to use ellipses and exclaim in French. Huge, clean taste of caramel, bitter herbs, plum, peach, and an elusive spicy sweetness that ushers in a finish of dry floral and bittersweet. Again, there are tastes wrapping under and through this that are delicious and unifying, and beyond my palate to describe. The complexity and balance of this exceptional brew cannot be exaggerated. Right through the long clean finish it is a balancing act worthy of Wallendas, An astoundingly delicious beer.  How Unibroue could make a beer like this is a question all brewers need to learn. It is so full of flavor, so thick and alive, yet so light in the mouth without the feeling of too much carbonation, and a resiny feel that never feels sticky, clean all the way through. It holds the flavor, and just gets better as it warms.  I have just re-checked the label to assure myself it is 8% ABV. Other than notes in the aroma I haven't tasted alcohol. This gets a triple red flag warning -- for intensely excellent drinkability.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,cratez,3.8,"Deep amber red with a rocky foam head. Lively sediment in the body. Huge bready aromas with lots of yeast and alcohol. Doughy and sweet. Signature Unibroue smell. Taste is spicy floral hop bitterness backed by a healthy dose of wheat malt and some pruney fruitiness. Boozy warmth, ultra smooth mouthfeel, tingly carbonated bite. Finishes tart and dry. Overall a very drinkable beer, but I'm not sure it's one of Canada's best. A bit too malty and kind of boring, if you ask me. I think Dieu Du Ciel pulls off the Belgian style much better than Unibroue, mostly by adding more hops to their beers. This one is still worth a try, though, and it goes down quite easy for an 8% brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,cpmau11,4.33,"Unibroue Maudite 12 oz bottle gold foiled top Poured into a snifter glass. A very large two inch off-white head with a dark amber body. Aroma is very floral and strong notes of caramel. Taste strong pale malts, caramel, good carbonation, slight alcohol flavor, cinnamon, and hint of fig or some kind of dark fruit. Mouthfeel is comparable to other unibroue beers, rich and warm but not too thick. Drinkability is great.  Overall this is my second favorite Unibroue beer and definitely one of my favorite Belgian strong dark/amber ales. Great lacing and head retention and classic belgian caramel flavor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Slightly more carbonated than I'd like but tastes great, so very easy to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Hunter,4.12,"A: Cloudy, apricot-copper brew with a thin head that vanishes fast.  S: Fruit, wheat, light spices like coriander and even white pepper.  T: Light, and somehow not. Spice candy and citrus dominates, behind which lurk floral and peppery bits. A somewhat oily aftertaste takes away from the overall score, but not too much.  M: Bracing, refreshing, but the 8% ABV manages to come through (more strongly as the beer warms). Light on the tongue but somewhat cloying in the finish.  D: Certainly another fine product by this brewer. Will find a spot on my regular rotation, but as a special treat. Not really something to quaff on a regular basis, either in terms of price or alcohol content.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

High carbonation (overly carbonated) with a medium body. As with other Unibrou beers its much better as it warms.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,NODAK,4.05,"Aroma is pretty sweet with fruity esters coming through..perhaps a little bit of a peppery smell as well.  Pours a cloudy rust color with a loose, foamy head that disappears fairly rapidly.  Mouthfeel is pretty thick. Taste is fruity as expected, but not overally sweet....the best way for me to describe it is that it seems pretty sweet but yet somewhat tart at the same time. I get both sensations from this beer. I also notice some spices and peppery notes from this.  Booze is pretty well hidden here although it's slightly noticeable. As it warms up, it does come out more, however. For 8 percent ABV, it's pretty smooth, but I wouldn't classify it as extremely drinkable simply because of the high ABV. Due to its thickness, it does hang around on the tongue for a while after each swallow with a bit of a lip smacking sweetness.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ChopperSmith,4.15,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Hopfenperle tulip glass.  Appearance - Poured a dark dark copper color, almost like a brown ale, but with a little amber color to it. A nice tan foamy head with nice retention. Very little lacing  Smell - Wheaty, grainy and malty with a hint of spice and citrus. Nice nose to this one. Unique.  Taste - Slightly sweet with a nice malty flavor. A little coffee or caramel and spices on the finish with just the right touch of bitter hops at the end. A very tasty BSPA.  Mouth Feel - Medium bodied, almost hearty. Just the right amount of carbonation for a beer with this much flavor.  Drinkability - For a relatively high ABV brew, this one is very tasty. Could easily do a session with a couple big bottles of this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,SleepyMonk,4.32,Chilled brown bottle with foil wrapped around the neck and cap.  Poured into a chalice glass the beer produces 2 fingers of bubbly head as to indicate a good degree of carbonation. When held to the light this one shows a perfect brown coffee-like color.  The aroma is in the caramelized toffee category with spicy garden herbs.  The caramelized toffee that dominates the aroma also features large on the palate. Orange peel notes give the toffee some depth and spicy garden herbs provide a very mild pepper.  In the mouth Maudite is crisp and almost pilsner like but this only gives away rapidly to a burst of sticky sweet fruit and a soft alcohol finish.  Good stuff.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,oakbluff,3.85,"12 ounce bottle- pours orange/brown. Quite cloudy with a two finger head. Silky lacing. Nose- Spice, musty, caramel. Taste- strong house yeast character, thick caramel malt, candi sugar, plums and a touch of heat. Medium bodied but also spritzy cabonation which makes for a lively and entertaining brew. A classic from unibroue that still holds up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Docer,4.16,"Snagged up a bottle at cost plus world market for rather cheap... best before 08-06-11. Poured into my hopworks 16.5 oz. tall mug.  - Great rich dark copper tone.. clear.. lots of head that quickly went down to about a pinky finger or so thick.. bits of light lacing.  - Strong banana yeast scent.. smells like a basic ol' strong Belgian.. little fruit, zesty hop, pine and oak.. earthy.  - Yeast, banana, some bread/biscuit.. caramel sweetness.. alcohol.. estery aftertaste.. some bittering hops.. pine. Cedar and oak wood notes.. rather complex and balanced w/ a great strength.  - Bit sour and dry.. not too puckering though.. slight chewyness..  - Overall it's spot on for the style.. really a great intro to strong Belgians.. or just good Belgians all together I think. Its a bit bubbly like most of their brews.. but that's what you get with the yeast and style... very good. Would give it a 5 but for the carbonation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,brianjay,3.58,"Poured from the artistic/intimidating/Mythological-Biblical inspired bottle into goblet style glass. Dark, muddy-brown color, fully topped off with a thick, airy head which was bright white and reflected the dark, lively body. The head left a thick lace around the glass throughout the session.  The nose had a mix of several subtle malt and fruit flavors. The mouth feel was full and viscous, with a light, crisp carbonation, leading into the taste which was tart and dry. A (sour) grape flavor on the tongue, and a charcoal finish. Lively all the way through, the taste was undertone and clean.  This is a beer you can spend some time with, but the taste is not so overpowering as to scare someone away...or have them running towards it. The body left a dry taste in the mouth in the same way a sparkling wine or champagne can.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Foxtrot,4.47,"I loved La Fin De Monde, and wanted to expand and see what Unibroue has to offer.  The pour produced a nice light ivory cap that slowly faded to a light film on top of a nice brown body. Beer is semi clear upon inspection in decent lighting.  Smell is potent with strong notes of dark fruits up front followed by yeast, bread, and a good solid dose of spices and phenol to even things out. This is shaping up to be a big beer.  And it sure IS a big beer. Big spice cloves pound the tongue with a touch of alcohol just to let you know that this is a big beer. Flavors pan out with a hint of caramel, dark fuits, some light molasses, and malts pave the way to a very refreshing and crisp finish.  Mouthfeel was prickly with good carbonation, and the decent ABV lends it to coat my mouth leaving residual flavors far after the sip.  Great drinkability. Loved this beer for its complexity. What another fantastic brew from Unibroue. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,JoEBoBpr,4.2,"A - Poured a dark dark copper color that in the glass looks more like a milk chocolate brown with an off white head that was about 1.5 in and was bubbly. It left a mat at the end.  S - A Witbeer quality comes to mind. A little bit of lemon peal, orange peal, nice citrusy touch, grainy malts are also mildly present. Some hints of vegetables, almost like a V8 but in a very appetizing sense (must be yeast).  T - Spicy, some peppers very attractive and crisp. Hops are almost none existent except for a dry finish. Many flavors but at the same time sort off light bodied. Some phenolic hints all around but not overpowering. Delicious and crisp.  M - Light to medium bodied. Very well balanced CO2 and sweetness. The alcohol is not so discernible.  D - Delicious! Refreshing even.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,sweemzander,4.54,"12oz. bottle poured into Unibroue tulip glass. Best by date: 7/15/11 printed on the back label. (A)- Pours a cloudy medium dark brown color with a slight reddish/maroon hue. A giant foam head appears that is still present several minutes later and does not go away. Slight lacing on the inside walls of the glass. (S)- Bright yeast and bananna/lemon aromas abound. Some clay and hay/yeast present. Refreshing smell considering its dark color. (T)- Nice delicate fruit flavors combined with a light yet rich malty/yeasty bite on the tonque. The clay/lemon/bananna are present from the smell creating a delicious beer even for summertime! (M)- There is alot of carbonation that creates some tension with the smooth, yet delicate flavors (but in a good way!) (D)- At 8%abv, its practically nonexistent! I certainly wouldnt mind enjoying a few of these anytime, anyplace, no problem (depending how long it takes me for the alcohol to take effect). Its complex, delicate and even refreshing to a point. Nontheless, its still a definite sipper so that you can experience every nuance this beer has to offer properly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,eat,4.42,"I bought this as part of a Unibroue taster pack, which is an amazing deal at $6.99 for one 341ml each of Trois Pistoles, Fin du Monde, Maudite and Don de Dieu.  Cloudy, light orangy-brown, this beer didn't pour with much head. A one-finger head quickly faded to a thin layer of bubbly white foam which seems to be sticking around. This head is strange: there seems to be no lacing but a millimeter-thick head is staying on until the end. I've never seen a head like this, usually thin foam layers disappear by halfway through.  Sweet smelling wheat, sweet fruit of some kind. To be honest I smelt something nice at first but the smell seems to have disappeared before I could figure out what was in there. It did originally smell good though. (Cotton candy! That's what I smelt. It smells like caramel concentrate. I'm going to have to upgrade the smell, this smells absolutely delicious once it warms up a bit).  What I was smelling before is more prominent in the taste. This is a sweet beer with a good balance; it's quite sweet without being too sweet. Big honey-wheat taste up front and bitter, dry blueberries on the finish. Some sweet rye whiskey in the background. The alcohol is hidden very well, only present to give a nice warm feeling on the way down. Very nice.  This might have a slight bit too much carbonation to fit with the taste but nonetheless is a smooth, medium bodied beer.  While I might not want to drink this often or in large quantities (because of the sweetness), it's very drinkable if you're in the mood for something sweet and complex. I've actually had this beer a few times in the past and didn't think it was anything special. Taking some time to explore the flavour has changed my mind; c'est un maudite de bière. Calisse ostie.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,OldSchoolGamer,3.3,"This is one of the last Unibroue beers I have yet to try. I haven't been that impressed as of now, so lets see how this one stacks up:  A: Pours a real cloudy, amber color. Hints of brown in there. Lots of tiny bubbles coming up from the bottom. Head is white and bubbly, but doesn't last very long.  S: Smells very yeasty with a bready backbone. There is quite a bit of fruit in there as well. Maybe cherry, apple, grape, and quite a bit of spice.  T: Get that typical Belgian yeast. Lots of bread in the flavor. Quite a bit of spice. Some dark fruit like cherry or grape. There is also a earthy undertone in there. The flavor just isn't that appealing to me. Tastes almost like all the other Unibroue beers.  M: Very bubbly and lively. Very crisp and clean. Again, pretty typical for all the Unibroue beers.  D: Drinkability is good I guess. It is 8% ABV but doesn't taste that strong. The main deterrant is the massive carbonation. Some people may like it, but I feel it masks the flavors too much and make it harder to go down.  The more Unibroue beers I have, the more I have a hard time distinguishing them from one another. Its an okay beer, but I have a hard time appreciating Belgian ales as they seem too much like drinking liquid bread. I prefer more robust and intense flavors. This is too much like a wine or champaigne.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S= Rose-like floral with a very pleasant dried cherry malty-tartness.  T= Sweet and tart, but not sour. The aroma shines through in the flavors. There is a slightly bitter aftertaste, but very refreshing. Got a tad of the yeast in the second pour, which gave it a bitter-metalic taste.  M= Medium-light body with medium carbonation.  D= This ale is in the lighter bodied range for the style. That, paired with the lower alchohol content, make it very drinkable. Its aroma is its unmatchable strength.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Spices like pepper, nutmeg, coriander and clove swirled with plums, raisins and prunes. Caramelized banana. Sweet malty undertone backed up by a blend of hops and spices. Belgian yeast is very noticeable in the finish-in a good way. Very complex like the smell.  Medium bodied with a crisp, silky and chewy feel all at once. This is the definition of a great mouthfeel.  It is a true treat to have a beer that is world class so available. If this beer was rare I think others would rate it more highly. I think because it is so available it gets lower marks.

T- oh my this has to be one of the best flavors i have ever had. There is a strong banana flavor that comes out bubbly. Clove and other floral spices mix well together and the alcohol is there to give you a bit. The pear taste like its caramelized a tad.  M- bubbly and smooth and sweet.

22,33,Magpie14,4.23,"A: the pour brought forth colors that matched the bottle: deep crimson, oranges, and fire engine red hues. I must say, a very nice display in the glass. The body displayed a plethora of bubbles with a head that is rather meager and fizzy at best. The color of the cap is dingy white, slowly melting away to fizz hovering on the top. Lacing is on the timid side  S: soft bubblegum, spices, and fruity apple based smells. There is nothing that really stands out or anything that comes across wild, subdued in the nostrils. Some caramel whiffs are noticeable  T: the palate puts forth some rather nice flavors. Lets see, tart pears and apples with rotten bananas and chunks of bubblegum lead the way. I also pull out some darker fruits of blackberries and maybe some cherries, ever so lightly on the tongue. Shortly there after a handful of spiced herbal leafy notes chop through the flavors and add a nice dimension. Candy-like toasted malts have a very delicate profile in the mix of flavors. A lot going on in this brew and mysterious in some ways  M: mild body is light, fizzy, and airy down the hatch. Full of refreshment. It is rather crisp, slightly tart, and dry in some ways. Easy to drink and fused well with the carbonation  D: Also, alcohol is hidden and the beers flavors move freely. These Canucks have got this brew down well, as well as the other Unibroue brews.

Very good but pricey.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,PatrickJR,4.71,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into red wine glass.  A - A simple, straight up brown with some slight haze. Two fingers of off white , head rise; retention is moderate and the head falls to a thick and persistent collar. Minimal lacing.  S - Extreme berry-like aromas here. Blackberries, overripe strawberries, and even a touch of raspberries are more than evident. Dark, sweet bread and banana hangs in the background. Notes of yeast lead into some quite spicy aromas; peppery and almost vegetal smells abound.  T - Mind blowing. Indistinct berry flavor with overtones of overripe banana. Moderate sweetness mingles with a touch of lactic sourness and segues into some very yeasty bread flavors. Sharp, drying spiciness kicks in with a definite high note of black pepper. Other spices reminiscent of a dubbel with herbal notes kick in as well. Mild black tea, mustard, and onion all make cameos in the myriad spicy tastes. Bitterness is mild and just enough to wash away the vestige of fruity sweetness. Yeast and peppery/savory spice lingers with a mild sourness that is somewhere between a raspberry and underripe strawberry. Small chalky/medicinal flavor creeps in and out to let you know it's a Belgian. Sip after sip I am getting this very distinct flavor.  M - Medium bodied, somewhat slick, with a moderate to moderate-high carbonation. Really no complaints here, but like a lot of Belgians I can only imagine how divine a thicker, ""flatter"" brew would taste.  D - Unibroue's finest from what I've sampled so far. I don't even know where to start. Maudite incorporates many of the great elements of Belgian beers and fuses them into a synergy of near perfection. The harmony, balance, and complexity of this beer is largely indescribable. A true hallmark of an amazing beer. This is a brew I will recommend and pass along for years to come.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Stavage,4.38,"Pours a very nice red/amber colour. A little bit of cloudiness gives it a layered murkiness which is very appealing to me. Poured with a big mass of thick rocky head which slowly reduced to a nice sticky lacing. It made me feel good towards the end to look at my tulip glass and see a nice rich copper liquid covered in a thick lacing.  Smell was nice. Very fruity malt and yeast smells and some pleasurable spiciness.  Taste was good. A very smooth maltiness coats your palate, some nice fruity flavours start coming up, a more nectary fruit flavour which goes along with the smooth malt and that spiciness is there too. Hops is very light but is there. Was expecting more from Unibroue's own description though to be honest I'm glad the hops is as mild as it is. I think a strong bitterness would have ruined this, smooth and subtle malts goes with a subdued hop bite for me.  Mouthfeel was great. Smooth with a light natural carbonation, full bodied.  Drinkability was fine for a sipping ale like this. Alcohol very well hidden (not as well hidden as the Trois Pistoles maybe). I almost wish I didn't share my 750ml bottle.  Overall a great brew. Smooth, mild, subtle yet complex. Normally I like fuller more robust flavours but this worked out really nicely.

22,33,bamadog,4.2,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip.  Appearance: Pours a murky coppery color with tons of carbonation bubbling throughout. Of course it has one of those huge Belgian heads that has pretty solid retention (or perhaps it should be regeneration from all the carbonation?) that is just slightly off-white.  Smell: The first scent I pick up on is sour fruit (I would say grape-like, perhaps some apple in there as well); a nice presence of spiciness is sneaking through as well; a firm malty backing as well; faint whiff of alcohol, but no especially strong; and for lack of a better term, I would say it smells kind of ""dry.""  Taste: Amazing. Smacked in the mouth with the sour grape-like/apple-esque fruit flavor and a heavy dose of the spices one would expect - coriander, nutmeg, perhaps a little cinammon; a very faint hint of alcohol, but like I find the few Belgians that I've had thus far, it's especially well-masked.  Mouthfeel: A lively drink due to the carbonation, but it's not overpowering and still goes down quite smoothly and evenly; it does indeed leave the mouth a bit dry and finishes pretty clean. Leaves a strong presence of the spices in the aftertaste, so it's very enjoyable from start to finish.  Drinkability: Pretty high, actually. It's got a slightly high ABV (compared to a lot of other beers out there, as of coruse, there always seem to be some bigger ones), but it feels pretty do-able and not especially overpowering. The finish is nice and it doesn't seem to sit too heavily; the flavor is of course immensely enjoyable and goes well with food.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Some lacing that stayed wet and slowly slides back down into the ale. Aroma-Yeasty-plain and simple, pungent, fresh with a hint of moist bread dough. Mouthfeel-I was expecting a sweet alcohol kick, but no. This ale tastes like a fresh bottle conditioned Belgian without any frills. The finish is where I got some nice flavor profiles. The alcohol and the dried fruit come out and linger between my palate and the roof of my mouth, in a very nice way. I have only had one of Unibroue's offerings previously. Maudite is a great ale and the yeast in this one creates a tasty strong ale without being overpowering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

It has a ruby, dark hue to it, and tons of bubbles. Leaves some sticky lacing. Smell is fruity, maybe some plum or strawberry. Taste is amazing, again, more dark fruit, and finishes smooth. The carbonation on this beer and pretty much all Unibroue beers is huge, I usually swirl my glass around for a long time trying to tame it. I think this beer benefits from warming up to some higher temperatures out of the fridge; you really get some fruit smells and taste out of it.

Taste sweet and tart and malty. There's a mix of caramel and smooth tart apple notes. There's a tart finish without much of a hop pressence. Spices comthrough with cumin and bitter orange.

A bit of a metallic off taste on the finish.  All in all, a good beer that I would not turn down, but I am a little at a loss to explain the high marks it has received from other BAers.

Tons of carbonation with some lacing. It had a huge off-white head that very slowly settled to a constant foam fed by the carb.  The aroma was bready malt, sweet with some good spices. Good aroma on this one. Saison like almost. The taste was good but seemed off just a little. The start was sorta bland and then kicked in right at the end with a good finish. Might need to try another to make sure this one was good sample. BSDA are hit or miss for me but this one was a hit (a good solid double).  Overall, a good beer that I do recommend. Will need to re-sample before I decided it's rotation fate though.  [resample]",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,seand,4.72,"Poured into a large red wine glass.  A: Pours a clear dark brown, with hints of red. 2 fingers of just off white head, which dissipates fast but leaves a layer on the surface. Good lacing.  S: Sweet, with hints of spice.  T: Very good. A nice sweetness that isn't overdone, hints of spice like the aroma. The alcohol is hidden quite well. The hops certainly aren't dominant, but they're there, and add some nice background complexity.  M: Great carbonation, that feels smooth even though it's quit effervescent. Slightly sticky mouthfeel. Very nice.  D: Very easy to drink, but somewhat high ABV.  This is quite an enjoyable beer, and I'd recommend trying it out if you get the chance.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BravoTwo,4.35,"A - Orange and amber with a minimal head, and some light lacing on the glass  S - Bready and cake like, with sime spice present, most notably a hint of clove  T - Well balanced, and hard to believe at the ABV. Nice subtle fruitiness (pineapple notes), clove, snd a little but of clean tartness.  M - Nice and crisp, very clean. Carbonation levels were appropriate and a nice little ""bite"" was there.  D - Ridiculously drinkable for an 8% beer. I could see this one really sneaking up on you and catching up. A very well made / balanced beer thet is a pleasure to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,illidurit,4,"Pours a deep opaque mahogany color with an airy light-tan head that leaves wisps of lace before rescinding into an amorphous film. Aroma is yeasty and doughy with tons of ester notes including banana, plum, and raisin. Flavor is raisiny and bready with a little cinnamon and pepper. Some alcohol is present but not too much. Finish is drying and slightly bitter. Body has a nice heft to it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,laituegonflable,3.69,"Had a bit of a froth explosion when opened, possibly it wasn't chilled enough. I left the bottle next to an open window on a cold evening. When poured, doesn't produce a lot of head - possibly due to the explosion. Pours a rich burgundy colour with light carbonation, produces nice lacing that just falls lightly. It cradles the glass but doesn't cling. Looks nice but no wow factor.  Quite phenolic nose with a deep syrupy rum kind of character fairly prevalent. Good strong hints of some sweet but tart fruits - strong raisins, some cranberries and a little citrus - possibly mandarin. Rum 'n' raisin nose, really. Smells impressive, sweet and powerful.  Taste has more of the tartness than the sweetness, with a heavy raisiny flavour punctuated by a red wine tannin kind of character. In fact, if there is a beer that is more similar to red wine in flavour and texture, I'm yet to find it. Has a lingering, earthy finish, I'd guess thanks to some Belgian style hops but the sensation is very reminiscent of dark cocoa.  Mouthfeel is very fluid, although there is enough texture to make an impression. A complex drop, this, with a very discriminating palate. It doesn't quite have the explosive delectability of a Trappist ale, but there's a lot to like. I would like someone to come and locate the 8% alc/vol though, because it sure as l'enfer ain't here. But then I've come to expect that from these Québécois geniuses.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The smell is slightly of spices that I associate with all unibroue products. Basically this is an extremely solid beer and a bargain at the price $8.49 for a 4-pack. A fantastic example of unibroue's take on a belgian style. I personally prefer La Fin Du Monde, but this is right up there along with trois pistoles. I could drink this every day and be completely fine.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Sweet bread, apples, caramel, raisins, brown sugar, with a touch of alcohol on the finish.  Medium to light on the tongue with a punch in the face of carbonation.  I love Maudite... I'm surprised I have not reviewed it before now, seeing as how many times I've had it. This one stays brilliant even as it warms, I will never tire of this brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Followed by pruny dark fruity blossom of scents.  T- First is the yeasty alcohol kick with a more refined fruityness of plum and sugar. Very complex flavor is nice to think about when sipping. Big bold taste of a Belgian dark.  M-D- Leaves a malty feel on the mouth with a dry kick as well when finishes. Drinkable but not as most from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

It would be a great beer with spicy food like pad thai or kung pao chicken. With a deep amber color and a one-finger head, the beer looks great in the glass. Maudite is a wonderful and drinkable beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,scootny,4.42,A big and majestic head rises up in my glass and while it leaves minimal lacing presents a pretty crown to an opaque mahogany brew.  Smell is thick with dark caramel malt and dark fruits. A large banana and yeast contingent mix with a sweet alcohol. Some sharp edges way in the back.  Taste is big fruitiness upfront giving way to the strong and deep malt backbone of a pumpernickel and brown bread hue. Bits of alcohol tinged spiciness and yeasty esters provide a dark sugared platform of molasses and toffee. Light hoppy floral close out the finish providing just enough bitterness to lend a clean quality to the swallow. Leaving a dark and sweet crackeriness lingering lightly with fain banana . Feel is creamy and slightly slick with a weight of perfect dimension.  Drinkability is a little too good for a beer of this potency. However the delight in the drinking outweighs the risks. Proceed with a bit of caution and a lot of joy.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mullenite,3.3,"Poured an opaque dark red-brown with a one-finger creamy off-white head. Excellent lacing to the bottom of the glass.  Smell was very sweet, dark fruit (particularly plum and fig), raisins, brown sugar and alcohol.  Taste was WAY sweet, a mixture of dark fruits and brown sugar. There was no complexity too it, just sweetness. I kind of wish I could have picked up some more flavors but it just came off as a sweet barleywine more than a BSDA.  Medium body with a lot of thin carbonation bubbles.  The sweetness just absolutely killed drinkability for this beer. More than one would be borderline cloying. I'm glad it was a 12oz and not a 750.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Buschyfor3,4.08,"Poured from 12oz bottle into 14 oz mug.  A: Deep amber-orange with a lot of sediment swirling in the glass. Pours a dense, creamy off-white head, two fingers thick. No lacing clings to the side of the mug.  S: I'm getting a lot of malts and grain-like notes - a heavy, bready aroma. Some spicy sweetness cuts through the maltiness, notably fresh cloves, perhaps some coriander.  T: Good balance between a grainy, whole-wheat bread flavor and the spiciness from the cloves and the alcohol. Sweetness comes forth at the start, like a caramel or dark honey, but quickly transitions into a nutty, fresh bread note followed closely by the spicy, slightly peppery alcohol. Finishes smooth with the yeasty, fresh bread flavors reappearing with just a little bit of dryness starting to creep in.  M: Like the last Unibroue I tried (Trois Pistoles), I get a slightly powdery mouthfeel. Lighter body, good carbonation.  D: 8% ABV gives just the slightest bit of warming, even though I know its presence in the peppery notes preceding the finish. Fairly well hidden; could easily drink another Maudite before the night is through. Probably slightly more drinkable than its Trois Pistoles bretheren, just because it's has a lower ABV and is better disguised overall, but I would say this beer is probably on par in terms of drinkability with Trois Pistoles - would enjoy another bottle of each regardless.  Another strong Belgian-style dark ale from Unibroue. This one was probably a tad bit sweeter upfront than Trois Pistoles, but that beer definitely had a lot more of a spicy, peppery punch. Either way, I would enjoy this beer again, but until I can compare Maudite side-by-side, sip-by-sip with Trois Pistoles, I cannot say I prefer one over the other. Regardless, another delicious and strong dark ale to suit my tastes.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,colts9016,4.34,"Phyl21ca gave me this bottle, thank you.  Poured into a chalice at 46 degrees.  Appearance A dark copper color with garnet highlights. There a half finger ivory head, that is foamy and creamy. There is a lot of effervescence in the beer. The clarity of the beer is not clear but it is not hazy, it is slightly opaque.  Nose: A rich malty aroma with dried cherries, plums and raisins. There are some phenols and a moderate amount of fruity esters. There are some clove like spices, toastiness, and bready aromas in the beer.  Taste: A rich malty taste with clove spices, toastiness, some bready flavors, dried cherries, plums, raisins, and phenols. The fruity esters are in a moderate amount.  Overall: The body of the beer is medium full. The mouth feel is carbonated and lightly dry. The finish is medium and lasts for a few moments on the palate. I am very impressed with the flavor of this beer. It is very well rounded, rich in flavor, and goes down well. I have seen these beers in the liquor store that I worked at and always thought that they were to big for me. Now a few years down the road I like a good Belgium beer. I was hoping for a bigger head, the half finger head had retention.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,HitokiriNate85,4.2,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.  A - Pours a semi-murky red to brown, with orange highlights coming through against the light. There's a nice two-finger head that fades fairly quickly to thinner covering, but that much of it persists. I was expecting a much bigger head, but using a snifter vs. a tulip might have something to do with it.  S - I can pick up hints of it from over a foot away. The first thing I noticed was a spiciness from the Belgian yeast. There's some malt mixed in as well. It might just be me, but I've noticed that certain aspects of a beer become much easier to pick up after I've tasted them. After a few sips, the dark malt is a lot more perceptible than before.  T - Wow. Definitely follows through from the nose. The spiciness hits up front. That leads through to the darker malts. There's a bit of fruitiness to it, but not to the level I've encountered with some other Belgian styles. The alcohol is hidden extremely well here, which I consider a big plus. It's a tough call between 4 and 4.5 for the score, but I'm giving it the bump up because of how well it covers the alcohol(I wonder if my bottle has been sitting for a while, but with a best by of 2011, I'd guess it's fresher).  MF - Lots of carbonation make it really lively and prickly. I think that gives the perception that it's 'light' in mouthfeel, but it leaves a thick, sticky coating afterward. I can never make up my mind over carbonation levels in high ABV beers, but it seems to work here.  D - I'm not well-seasoned with the style, but out of the few examples I've had, this is definitely the most drinkable(each one has been surprisingly distinct from one another). At the same time, I definitely wouldn't have more than one. It was $4 for a 12 oz. bottle, so I'll hunt around for a better price before picking up another.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,beerindex,3.46,"I'm not normally game for anything originating from Montreal (the consequence of having spent many years in Ontario), but I wanted something darker to finish out the night. And so I went with Maudite. And I'm quite glad I did.  The beer had a nice red-brown color to it, which though not quite as striking as the pitch-black look I tend to favor, was already a good sign, suggesting to me that it ought to be a fairly nuanced indulgence. And this proved true.  The well carbonated beer did a good job of not being overwhelmed by its higher abv, having a fruit and carmel taste that was sweet but not overwhelmingly so. Cherries, raisins, and plums came together nicely to form the main flavoring elements of the beer.  I must admit, I was a bit rushed with this beer, needing to catch a bus. So perhaps that is why I found it not as drinkable, especially in a session capacity, as some of my other beers of choice. But I did find this to be a good sipping beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

It went down to one finger and stayed there leaving some lacing. The color was a cloudy copper.  S - Malty and sweet with a cola hint to it. Spicy wheat with fruity and flowery aspects. A defined citrus tang to it along with clay and bread aromas as well. What a complex smell!  T - Lots of lemon/lime citrus flavors with a light malty sweetness that finishes very light and refreshing! Earthy flavors with some tart, spices, and white grape are also detectable here too.  M - The heavy carbonation leaves a bubbly bite to the mouthfeel. It finishes extremely crisp and refreshing though. Light to medium in body.  D - Due to its incredibly strange flavor profile, for me, this beer's drinkability is not as high as it could be. Towards the end it went down easier. What a unique beer. Never had anything like this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Appearance: Pours a lovely raisin reddish-brown with moderately low clarity and only a skim of white foam that fades immediately to a thin ring leaving no lacing.  Smell: Deep, syrupy malt aroma with hints of dark, chewy cherries, sticky fruit and yeast.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Really excellent take on the style - lots of sticky, sweet fruits like cherries, plums and raisins with hints of banana. Chewy, syrupy caramel malts act as a foundation to the rest of the flavors. Excellent carbonation spreads the tastes well across the palate and helps the alcohol warmth hang around after swallowing.  Drinkability: Pretty high. The relatively sticky aftertaste and strong, flavorful presence are really enjoyable.

Flavor is outstanding. The sweetness is evident, but I could not drink it if it was too sweet. Nicely balanced with a touch of tartness. Maybe some faint hop aftertaste, but the malts dominate.

Little aftertaste and balanced flavors on the tongue are a plus, even as the throat feels the gentle heat that its name implies. Spices abound in the tastebuds, with a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and a few unidentifiable bits taking the flavor to a complexity most winter warmers would dream of--no syrupy drip or spruce tree pine corniness here... I could see this beer posessing a dinner-table versatility as well as being a desertif.

22,33,adamette,4.35,"Live review. Served from 750 ML bottle purchased at Chuck's Fine Wines in Chagrin Falls, OH for $5.99 late last year. Best by date of 5 09 10. Poured into my Gulden Draak tulip glass.  A 3 inch head that sticks around for at least 10 minutes although closer to that 10 minutes it had reduced down to 0.5 cm. First glass displayed a medium brown/ruby body without much sediment at all. I am sure the bottom of the bottle will produce more of that though.  S Well, dark sweet malt, almost molasses like is easily detected and a great Belgian style yeast is also able to be smelled. Really like the smell.  T Dark malt hits me first and then there is a rush of barley, wheat, yeast and a whole lot of grains which is then taken over by a malty sweetness. Interesting in its layers of taste. Within the grain layer is a distinct Belgian yeast taste.  M A bit lighter than I might have been ready for. There is not the syrupy stickiness that I find in other Belgian Strong Dark Ales. Overall the mouthfeel remains big though with moderately elevated alcohol and layers of tastes.  D Really good for this style as many other ones, in their greatness, can only be enjoyed one at a time. I am not going to have an problem finishing this 750 ML bottle (it is two snifters worth).  Notes: I was really looking forward to trying this one as it is one of my favorite styles from one of my favorite brewers. I found it to be a bit lighter than I expected but pleasingly complex and very drinkable. Everyone should try Maudite.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A- Pours an almost apple-cider like amber-red with about 2 inches of head that rises after you pour it (love that with the Belgians...). Great retention on the head. Good lacing.  S- Not extremely strong, but still present, Belgian spices, cloves, a little apple, maybe some grapes, plums, slight butterscotch when I poured it. Kind of like a spicy Hennepin, honestly. Alcohol barely noticeable.  T- Belgain spices, cloves, plums, cherries, slight funk (but nice, not distracting or gross), Sweet malt (faint). There's a lot there, but it's balanced. Similar to Trois Pistoles, but with less port/wine character and more spices. I really like this.  M- Medium to light bodied, clean, moderately carbonated. Good for the style.  D- This is really enjoyable. I keep going back for more sips because I'm looking for more flavors. I'll be in trouble if I have a bunch of these (8% ABV).

The fruits and malt are detectable in the aroma but in a subtle way; not strong at all but when you taste it the spicy (pepper) dark fruity notes give way to caramel toffee and malt. This is a very well balanced beer that gets more flavorful as it warms Very smooth in the mouth with lots of carbonation typical for the style. The 8% ABV is hidden too well in this delicious beer. One could lead to another very easily. I had passed on this Unibroue offering several times choosing La Fin du Monde 17 or Trois Pistoles instead but I won't do that again.

Tastes 'thinner' than it appears  D) Maudite is a good ale with its own distinct taste. Very yeasty or is it hoppy? Very something.... Another good beer from Unibroue",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CanuckRover,4.3,"Pours a hazy light maple. Big pillowy head with good retention, fairly slick lacings.  Nice aroma of soft, sugary apples with little bit of a darker character from the malt. Unibroue yeast is noticeable, a nice light dusting.  A substantial beer. Nice, big, thick flavours come out immediately. Lighter, apple flavours start things out but quickly give way to dates and then to even darker fruits from the malt. A very light caramel sweetness kicks in right at the end before it is completely overshadowed by the dry house yeast and some subtle bittering hops.  Very smooth with tongue teasing carbonation. I find this to be the most drinkable of the Unibroue strong ales. Very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,JohnQVegas,3.81,"Bottle into chalice.  Pours cloudy brown with gargantuan pillowy , off-white head that settled in but stuck around for quite awhile.  Aroma is kind of subdued -- yeasty, spicy, bit of sweet dark fruit.  Taste is interesting -- prickly carbonation combines up front with spicy yeast and bittersweet dark fruits, opens up and finishes with spicy yeast, bittersweet dark fruits, with a lingering, dark fruit and licorice bitterness on the finish.  Mouthfeel has the carbonation spot on, but a bit watery. Interesting take on the style, great beer but has potential to be even better with a bit less watery mouthfeel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,IMincedTheKing,4.56,"Pours a deep clear brown with a rocky head that stuck around a good while. It's a real beauty with lots of bubbles rising from the bottom.  The aroma is rather faint, predominately yeast, with hints of dark fruits and malts. With such a weak aroma, I was expecting to be disappointed, and on the palate, it follows the fruits and sweet malts of the nose--but damn is it delicious! This is a remarkably tasty beverage. Though it feels a bit thinner in the mouth than I expected, the flavors are balanced so well, and the mild carbonation is a great complement.  All I can say is more, more, more! (At 8% ABV, that might not always be the best idea, but I stick with my judgment: more, more, more!)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Colour is dark reddish amber with bits of yeast floating in the haze. Pour created an active head that didn't linger.  Smell is a mxiture - malty, bready, fruity - all in one.  Taste - yes - this was a complex amalgam on flavors. Everything in the nose continued to the tongue. There was so much going on here to pick out everything I liked, but it was a great ride. Of the fruit, I'd say a cherry taste came to the forefront the most.  Very drinkable. Easy to have a few of these and enjoy every one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dotsonjamesg,3.92,"I bought his brew on Little Rock AFB at the Shoppette. Someone here lately has requested more exotic and specialty beer and I am eternally grateful for it, as the selection of specialty beer in Arkansas is TERRIBLE! Good beer to the locals is ""Bud Light Lime"" and ""Natty Ice."" I am new to the region and am originally from California, which is a ""beer mecca,"" so you can see the dilemma of ignorance I deal with here concerning beer.  I have enjoyed several Unibroue ales but have never had the Maudite until now. Belgian strong ales/dubbels/trippels are not my favorites but I do enjoy them if they are worthy of my palate.  Served, beyond brutally cold, in a chilled 12 oz stemless wine glass.  Appearance: Pours a one finger, flimsy, light brown head. The brew is dark brown, just as a Belgian Dark Ale should be.  Smell: Scent is lovely and loaded with spice and candied sugar. Probably one the best Dark Belgian Strong Ales my nostrils have had the honor to experience.  Taste: Strong, carbonated, malty sweetness initially then it moves in to a more mellow, bitter alcoholic flavor. I can pickup sugar, dark fruits, and spices. The alcohol is pretty well hidden with the flavor of the brew. The flavor isn't as strong as I had hoped for, for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I have had better but in all regards, it is good.  Mouthfeel: Thick and luxurious . The carbonation is pretty nice and pairs well with this brew.  Drinkability: Overall, it's a good brew but I think it could have been a bit bolder in flavor. I will note that it is fairly filling. I would highly recommend this brew to anyone looking to expand their palate but I would like to point out that there is some better stuff out there.

There is a thick crown of head that slowly settles into a rocky white top.  Aroma is fruity and slightly sweet with apples, raisins, and red wine.  Flavor is deep with dark fruits like plums and cherries. Roasty sweetness gives way to spicy bitterness with every sip. Cloves and banana come through from the Belgian yeast.  Mouthfeel is smooth with medium-plus body but the carbonation is a little much for me. Drinkability is good for the style. As with all of the Unibroue beers I've had, this one did not disappoint.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The smell is yeasty and spicy, nothing jumps out particularly but it's very nice smelling. The taste is also very yeasty and spicy and in the taste some fruit tastes come through. Also a little bit of wheat is apparent.

22,33,marcpal,4.13,"From the Unibroue variety pack, this was poured into a Weyerbacher tulip. Tasted on 3/10/09. Bottle Graphics: 2/10. Ugliest brewery art (but good beers usually so who really cares)  A: A nice-looking light brown color to the body. Strong carbonation with a pretty big head that went away awfully fast. Momentary lacing.  S: Belgian spices and yeast. Smells pretty hefty and the clove is the dominant flavor- perhaps some cardomam and coriander. The yeast cries out from this brew- a pungent aroma. This is the first time I have come across something like cilantro in the back of the nose, and I have a stuffed nose which makes it even more impressive.  T: Yeasty in flavor. The fruits shine through and has some sugar sweetness. Flighting finish on the beer. The one knock is that the pepper, spices, and wheat really dominate where I think it could use a dose of bitterness to round it out.  M: Pretty substantial heft to the body with a very dry finish.  D: Another Belgian style success by Unibroue. I did not like the first venture into this brewery but this sample pack turned me around. This is surely not one I would seek out but would be more than happy to have it in the fridge.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Great head retention, about a finger throughout, with little lacing and tons of carbonation evident.  Smell is very herbal and spicy. Definitely a sense of the bready malt along with some cinnamon and other strong herbs.  Taste is not great. Most of what I get out of it is just a bitter taste. It also seems slightly sour, maybe a little sour apple flavor. Doesn't taste natural to me, seems artificial.  Mouthfeel is where it really lets me down again. Lots of bitter taste, lots of carbonation, but other than that it's pretty watery and doesn't do much for me on the way down.

T: Heavy wheat flavors with a touch of dark spice; malty character is balanced by a touch of hops; residuals of spices left gracefully on the tongue. M: Medium-bodied with appropriate carbonation.

S: Hints of cinnamon, graham, and spice. Almost like a far-off pumpkin pie. Smells yeasty and sweet.  T: Starts off mildly sweet, but as it warms you can start to taste the yeast. Leaves a tart aftertaste on the rough of the mouth. Short dry finish, too.  M: Medium bodied with decent balance with the carbonation. Had a fresh ""kick"" to it.  D: A very refreshing drink.

Very raisin-like smell to it. Taste was excellent. Had a lot of the flavor profiles of a fine dubbel. Cinnamon and caramelized sugar gave it some sweetness and a note of hay/straw gave this beer some dryness at the back of the throat. Paired well with a goat cheese tart salad. Could have been a bit thicker in the body, but overall this rates as one of Unibroue's best offerings.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The brew was poured into a chalice glass and had a cloudy brown color with a smaller than expected light tan head. The head retention was a little disappointing and the lacing was some what limited. The aroma has a good deal of character with thoughts of apple, banana, plum and a nice yeast scent. The taste is nice, wheat that has a toasted character, fruit, clove and a slightly banana yeast flavor. Some alcohol flavor as the brew warms.

M- A touch heavy on the carbonation but it rolls out of the way nicely although burns the tongue a bit in the process, moderate fullness.

Pours a deep, dark red almost maroonish with a big thick fluffy white head. Looks great in the Unibroue glass provided.  Smell is sweet, juicy fruit, stewed apples, caramel, some yeastiness but overall a lot of dark fruit character.  Taste is incredible. All of that sweet, dark juicy fruit is in every sip. Its akin to the character of Aventinus a little bit I think. Just an amazingly easy to drink, smooth beer but with so much flavor.

A- Maudite pours out a dirty tan color out of the bottle but when settled in the glass this BSDA has a dark bronze color with a minimal white foamy head. No lacing.  S- This has a strong caramel smell from the malt along with a ripe fruit array coming through as well. A bit of yeast is apparent as well. Some spices with warming.  T- The spices come out more with some clove and light pepper. The malt is king with the caramel coming through. A bit of yeast as in smell with just a touch of alcohol. Not getting much hops but i believe this is an old bottle. Fruits such as apple and pear as well.  M- Was ok initially but really fell flat 6oz or so in. Either way this was medium bodied with minimal carbonation. Coats the palette for a few seconds than nothing. Some lingering fruit flavor.  D- A decent BSDA but I prefer Trois Pistoles as this one is a bit lighter in all areas, especially mouth. Would love to try a fresh bottle as I think a bigger hop presense would of improved things.

S: Spicy and yeasty with dark sweet fruits.  T: As the beer warms, the spice really comes out. Spice and yeast start off with flavors of sweet fruit such as cherry, banana, apple and some raisin. A nice sweetness settles in with a candy sugary sweetness all along pairing with the spice flavor. A nice dry finish indicates a nice hop presence. Very good beer.  M: Full and coating but not overly lingering. Very slight alcohol flavor, but nothing leads you to beleive it's 8%.  D: High, this is a good beer that goes down easily. Very nice drinker.

Excellent  T: The flavors from the nose are pretty much replicated here, with the spice taking the lead and the fruit character. As this warms up, it becomes rather intensely yeasty and spicy.

But this could just be my perception of what it should be, I have only had 1 or 2 others, so maybe THEY were the ones that were out of style, who knows now.

A mix of sweet malts and some bread/yeast aromas peek through, along with some very light hops. This ale is unbelievably smooth and creamy, never had a Belgian that I could say was this smooth. Sweet malts like caramel and maybe something like gum/cake icing (sugary) along with toffee or roasted malts to keep it balanced and give it a dry backbite. Also contained citric and dark fruit tastes in the hops; I could detect orange and possibly banana but I couldn't decipher the rest. Did get a little sticky on the sides from the excessive malts, but this is a damn good beer w/ the 8% hidden well; I could session this even though a few would knock me out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dfolmste,4.13,"Appearance: Very carbonated beer. I had to pour it quickly so it wouldn't fizz over. Head is a tan color that climbs the glass but falls just as quickly. Color is a dark amber made hazy by steady streams of bubbles and bottle conditioned yeast.  Smell: An earthy smell with fruit mixed in. Apple and banana hidden underneath a smokey malt odor. Alcohol smell stays masked by other scents. Pretty complex.  Taste: Wow! A rolling taste that crosses all parts of the tongue. Sweet, but not overpowering. Most likely belgian candy sugar. Roasted bread/biscuit malt character mesh well with the roasted characteristics reminding me of a banana just passed its ripeness. I was impressed and wish my pallate was a bit more refined.  Mouthfeel: So far I am loving the belgian style body. Aftertaste is just one more layor of the flavor. Thicker feel matches the taste well.  Drinkability: I would recommend having this beer with food, but having it alone allows for a greater appreciation of the taste. Alcohol is 8% and it is as hidden as the hop flavor. A beer to be savored. Even still, I like to vary the beer I drink in a sitting, but still could have had a few more of these and still noticed new tastes.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,Metalmonk,4.13,"Thick, thick, thick pillowy head takes a long time to replace bubbles with beer...but that's okay, because it looks great. Color is an entrancing milk-chocolate/caramel brown with all kinds of cloudiness and a zillion bubbles marching to the surface. If it tastes half as good as it looks...  Aroma is nutty yeast, candi sugar, brown sugar, cardamom, banana, more yeast, caramel and a light kiss of alcohol warmth.  Flavor is a mirror of the nose, only less distinctive in its individual components and more a mingling of them, to the point that every sip offers a different flavor angle. Banana character is something I don't remember about Maudite (haven't had this in a few years), but it's there, though not like a German hefe-weizen. Obviously the yeast plays a huge part, imparting husky nut elements in addition to banana, while malts offer toffee and powdered cinnamon. There's also frutiness like thick apple cider, a little marshmallow, and playful alcohol warmth.  I'm probably drinking this warmer than suggested, so the smooth, gliding texture might be partly a result of that. It's a gentle, airy feel, like watery melted butter (in a good way). Kind of moves over to let the flavors take center stage.  Just an inch or two short of delivering a blow-your-mind knockout punch. Maudite is a sensible 8% ale, and because of its tame, refined character it makes an excellent gateway for those just discovering Belgian-style beers. This was one of the handful of beers that converted me to the Belgian ways, and because of its availability and modest price tag, it has no doubt done the same for thousands of others. Thanks to the generous coldmeat23 for providing it as a trade bonus!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mikereaser,3.88,"A - pours a dark chestnut brown with 1/4 inch of foam that quickly disappeared to a fine layer of bubbles  S - some spicy notes and fruit  T - roasted malts, a bit of hop to it, i'm getting some marshmallow and nuts as well  M/D - nicely carbonated and pretty easy drinking. Good taste that goes down way to easy for an 8% beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,damienblack,4.12,"Pours a golden amber, difficult to determine where one ends and the next begins. Aggressive pour leads to a massive peach-colored head, very sticky. Smells like one of the sweeter bocks, big yeast smell, and a big plumy sweetness. A little bit of barnyard staleness or mustiness in the smell. Normally I'm not a fan of big yeast smell, but this one is just intoxicating.  It has a definite wheat taste to it, backed by sweet malt, some dry spiciness. Very yeasty, and just a bit acidic. All of the flavors are well in balance, it's not overly sweet and cloying, nor is it very dry and spicy. Everything comes into play, making this one tough for me to describe. Very drinkable, not much at all in the way of alcohol burn. A very enigmatic beer, but one which I look forward to enjoying in the future.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,puboflyons,4.4,"Poured from a 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of 03-20-11. Sampled on Feb. 7, 2009.  Appearance - a gorgeous but cloudy mahogany-brown with a puffy tan head that lingers as expected for the style. Yet this is more beckoning.  Smell - A burst of yeast in the aroma due to the in-bottle fermentation followed by pungent hops. There is also something kind of spicy in the mix...something clove-like.  Mouthfeel - Definitely a chewy texture with a decent and bold body.  Taste - A powerful element of hops. The high alcohol content is offset by the spicy flavors. Finishes moderately dry.  Beligian Strong Ales are not one of my favorite styles but Unibroue carries this one off with class.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,OtherShoe2,3.75,"Pours a hazy brown/red with a head that starts and disappears. This looks like a clarified version of apple cider. Minimal lacing.  Big whiff of fermented fruit and some spicy notes.  Booze bite right up front. Chemical alcohol dissipates and you get some dried fruit sweetness, some spice, some bitter bite, and some toasted malt. And just like that -- wham wham wham.  A sipper, it is mouth coating but not overly full in body.  I appreciate the flavor complexities here, but the alcohol chemical element keeps getting in the way for me. I would actually like this a hell of a lot if the booze was toned down a bit. Much easier to drink once you get part way into the pint, either you personally adjust or it warms a bit. If you are not into big kick in the balls Belgians, don't go here -- but really worth a try if you want to try a good example of the style. Not for everyone, and not something I would hit regularly, but a very very well made beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,velkyal,4.84,"Pours dark brown with a big cream head which hung around doggedly.  The nose was dominated by licorice and gingerbread, the perfect Christmas aroma!  The taste though was rather surprising, lots and lots of caramel, backed up by cloves - almost like a light Christmas pudding, with a very subtle bitterness underscoring the sweetness.  Despite the somewhat hefty kick of alcohol, Maudite is very smooth and was like drinking liquid fudge.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,argock,4,"Poured from 12oz brown bottle into a clear oversized wine glass. Frehsness date on back label. Purchased as 4-pack from Harris Teeter (Charlottesville, VA) for $9.99.  A: Dirty dishwater peach yellow with foamy, big-bubbled beige head with so-so retention and no lacing.  S: Subdued aromas of cherries, herbs, spicy yeast, and rounded malt character  T: Tangy and herbal are the first two words that come to mind. Some berry/cherry sweetness meets a yeasty and herbal, spiced hops character. It avoids becoming vegetably with strong malting.  M: Full-bodied with sensuous thick, chewy feel accentuated by low carbonation.  D: A beer that is a lot better than the sum of its parts.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CMW,4.18,"A: Dark brown with considerable head formation. Hints of red and amber can be seen when held up to the light.  S: The nose is sweet and spicy. This is a small amount of floral accents as well.  T: Much sweeter than I expected. There is a definite taste of fruit (apples or pear. There is a bit of hop bitterness in the finish. At 8% alcohol there is only a slight tinge of alcohol.  M: Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Almost a velvetly feel.  D: Very drinkable and with the alcohol well hidden, I could have more than one. Especially when these are on tap.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,schroederm,4.2,"In a Chimay chalice:  Cool deep deep orange/brown color with quickly dissipating head. Smelled tons of citrus, with some green apple and a little nutmeg. Tasted awesome... great malts, nice and warm (but not hot) and orange. Carbonation was high, but in line with the style.  Overall: An excellent, go-to, and available Belgian Strong Dark.

Yeast, pineapple, dark fruit, brown sugar and malts.  Taste. An excellent follow through from the smell. Very well balanced. The sweet yeast, spices, raw sugar, dark fruits and pineapple are all present and blended beautifully.  Mouthfeel. Medium-bodied, creamy with a refreshing amount of carbonation. Delicious.  Highly drinkable beer. This one is going down fast.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S- the first thing I can smell is the classic Unibroue yeast. After that comes the parade of fruits. Cherries, plums, figs, apples, and pears.  T- that unibroue yeast makes itself known. As do the fruits. Almost the same as I could smell. Very malty and sweet.  M- very light, almost watery. The carbonation is through the roof!  D- the 750 was enough for me. However, this is something I could drink again and again. An often overlooked brewery that produces nothing but solid Belgian style beers.

Also smelling some wheat and a little spice  First taste is of wheat and maybe some coriander. Bready malts and a faint aftertaste of alcohol is also present  Beer is way over carbonated. Nice medium bodied beer, not too light.  This beer was very good. Only thing that got to me was the over carbonated.

22,33,khiasmus,4.18,"A monk traveled from a remote Abbey in search of a new and different way of life. There was no reason other than a restless soul and a longing for the new and different. The same yeast, the same sugars, the same way of life for the last 22 years had left him underwhelmed and despondent. Drawn by the brown liquid, he surveyed the beer up against the light, and an amber glow greeted his quizzical gaze. Lacing and immense head. Put it in your mouth... Quad? too light. No real style to place it into, other than just good beer. dark fruits... raisin... warm alcohol... dry hops... pine bark... wood... Fluffy and smooth, oily, heavy and dense, but light and airy at once... So there's no way to know what happened next. After 8 pints or so, he lost himself in the teak walls, the metal urinals, the dry humour of his compatriots... Are there really any heroes among fools? To return to his homeland, of course, to go back to his old way of life... but he had made memories. He had been inspired by this strange attempt at his craft. Nothing he did from this point on would be the same, the eyes of his heart and mouth had been enlightened.  He sent his next recipe to unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,SurlyDuff,4.47,"Had this a dozen times before, not sure why i didnt review prior.. hmm.  Beautiful 75ml caged and corked bottle. Great artwork and packaging. I can always spot a Unibrou out on any shelf, so their marketing department is doing something right.  A lovely pop from the cork and it puors a deep amber with an offwhite foamy head with consistanty same sized bubbles. Perfect pour into my Westy goblet.  Aroma is classic Unibrou propietary yeast, powdery and smooth.  Sweet floral and herbal earthiness, delicious fruit (raisin and a bit vineous) and classic unibrou spicing with bits of ginger, clove, and nutmeg. Bready and oh so deliciously complex.  Incredibly drinkable despite the abv, a real must try for any beer geek...along with Trois Pistoles, LfdM, and some of their other staples, you just can't go wrong.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,farrago,4.75,"Measure the pour, if too quick half the glass will end up full of head. That said, very active, like scrubbing bubbles, and disappear swiftly. Light brown to dark amber in color, dusky and fully opaque. Very fruity nose of raisin, date, plum, cherry, gingerbread, cinnamon stick with some underlying dark chocolate and rose hips to boot, no hops to be found. Medium-bodied, admirably maintains consistent weight throughout. More chocolate here with coffee ice cream hints too, the sweet plum, cherry, prune, golden raisin fruit a major part without getting out of hand. Carbonation serves more to stir the elements than lift. Clove rather than the previous ginger or cinnamon. Sharpens its focus as it nears ending so as to retain balance and clean up some.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,brushtachio,4.57,"Poured dark amber into a chalice. Cream-colored head is shortlived, receding to just a ring that lasted through the whole beer. The smell us very sweet with notes of raisins and a touch of floral alcohol but not too much. Taste is complex and comes in waves. Dried cherry, more raisins, prune then a final hop bitterness that is subtle but noticable in it's contrast to everything that's come before.  Only real criticism is that the carbonation is a bit over the top. I think moderate to high carbonation is appropriate for the style but there's a bit too much bite  Great BSDA nonetheless.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jimsimply,4.54,"Poured from bottle to wide-mouth wine glass.  Deep amber color with lots of carbonation and a thick, creamy white head. Plenty of lacing sticks around for a while.  Rich, fruity nose, with some spicy notes: I thought of both coriander and nutmeg. Bready undertones.  Strong, yeasty flavor, to be expected from an ale on lees. Plenty of breadiness from the yeast, along with some cinnamon and orange peel. Has the mouthfeel to match; good body.  Almost too drinkable. I put away the second half a bit fast, without thinking, and definitely got the alcohol's effect.  Enjoyable experience.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Black currants, bready, extreme yeast, caramel.  M)Medium level of carbonation.  D)Very drinkable for a high gravity beer.

22,33,HeyItsChili,4.42,"A - Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a murky, vibrant garnet with a medium, foamy, white head.  S - Strongly bready, bold malts, fruity, oranges, mild spices.  T - Yeast is yelling at the top of its lungs while apples, candied fruit, brown sugar, and malts harmonize in red and white striped shirts and hops and alcohol doo wop in the background.  M - Medium bodied and foamy, a fair level of carbonation.  Notes - I trust Unibroue. I'd let it date my daughter. This beer makes me happy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,AdmiralDiaz,4.59,"A: Pours a very orange color with a one finger off-white head with decent retention.  S: Very yeasty with a lot of fruits and spices.  T: Belgian yeast is very noticeable. Other strong flavors were caramel, apples, dates, and cherries. Very delicious.  Overall I'd have to say I like the Trois Pistoles just a bit better than this one although they are both very different for the style. This is a great tasting beer that is very drinkable for the style/alcohol content and is smooth with a slight creamy feel in the mouth. Will buy again hands down.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,trumpetego,3.52,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a wide wine glass. Appearance is not too impressive. Amber/brown color, cloudy. Light for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. A thin white head quickly disappears, leaving a tiny amount of lacing. Smell is very bright for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Fruity, with hints of cherry, strawberry, and orange. Also a bit of a bubble-gum flavor, more remeniscent of a German wheat beer (think Aventinus) than a Trappist ale. Taste shows more of the German-style wheatiness. Banana is a pretty strong flavor, with more fruit and berries mixed in. No hops to speak of. Very active carbonation, which contributes to an extremely dry finish. Even with all the fruit flavors and aromas in this beer, it doesn't end up being very sweet. Drinkability is okay. This is not one of my favorite Unibroue beers, and I probably won't seek it out in the future. It's drinkable and carries its ABV well, but the flavors are not very complex. I'm also used to more dark flavors (caramel, coco, etc) in BSDA's.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MICAMD,4.13,"A- A deep ruby orange, slightly hazy. The head is thick, slightly off white, and very creamy looking. There is a nice crystal ball effect when held to a light.  S- Very fruity with a very distinct Belgian yeast aroma. Spicy and bready as well.  T- Same as the aroma, but pretty mellow. Very tasty, but not all that unique.  M- Ridiculously creamy. Very nice.  D- An enjoyable beer. Doesn't knock my socks off, but it is very well done for the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,DmanGTR,4.42,"A - poured a lovely dark ruby/garnet with a massive 2.5"" off-white head that prevailed in the form of a creamy bubbly cap throughout. Some lacing.  S - cherries, apricots, figs, and raisins. These lovely fruits mixed well with the breadiness from the yeast and has some winter spices thrown in the mix  T - initial sweet maltiness is followed by spices, dark fruits, and a good alcoholic kick at the end. Added yeast increased the nuttiness a bit.  M - medium bodied with moderate carbonation which holds everything together nicely  D - very drinkable. Unique and pleasant with a good mouthfeel makes for good drinkability. Alcohol may sneak up though.  Overall - Not a beer for the faint of heart, this is the second Unibroue offering I've had aside from the Trois Pistoles and this one is excellent as well. A great nightcap or an after-dinner beer. DO NOT ruin this by pairing it with pizza. Reviewed from notes (multiple reviews yielded the same great results.)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,patobandito,3.68,"I for some reason had high expectations for this one. The label was just cool, the bottle had foil on it, and I am easily impressed.  Poured a hazy dark brownish red color. Thick head with lacing. Smelled of spices and a tinge of alcohol. Tasted cloves, some ginger, malt, and possibly some sort of citrus. It was a smooth drink for an 8%. Good, but not as great as I expected.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Gyle41386,4.47,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle purchased at Total Wine in Columbia, SC.  Pours a deep red/brown with a nice large foamy head...head dimishes, leaving minimal lacing. Nice fruity/yeasty/alcohol scent that hit me as soon as I popped the cap off the bottle, and it spread throughout the room as the beer filled the glass. Had I not already seen the 8% ABV on the bottle, I probably would've figured it out from the scent alone. Taste is very complex. Sweet and light. The alcohol content isn't nearly as recognizable in the taste as it is the smell. I think the mouthfeel is excellent. The collection of small bubbles caress the tongue and throat, and the beer leaves a slight spicy aftertaste. This is surprisingly drinkable for an 8%, and one to be careful with.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BigJTrucker,3.83,"Picked up this bottle at Costco as part of a Unibroue Sample Pack.  Poured into a snifter, a deep brown/red color with a thick foamy off white head that settles very slowly. Aroma is very classic belgian with candied ginger, brown sugar notes, lots of bready yeast. Taste has the candied notes, some caramel and malty sweetness. A faint bit of licorice and clove.Mouthfeel on this one is a bit effervescent for me. lots of body, but just a bit to fizzy.

Could smell this as soon as I popped the cap. Very inviting  T: Ripe fruit, German rye bread, grapefruit and slight hop presence. Very complex and nice dry finish.  M: Really comes alive in the mouth. Nice and light but not watery. Nicely carbonated, but no belching yet :D  D: I've yet to have a belgium as drinkable as this so I'm gonna have to give it a 5. Ive got 5 more of these in the beer fridge, and I might have to pop another one.  Im from a SHITTY town in SW ontario and this is the ONLY excellent beer I can get within 60 miles.

Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1 1/2"" beige head over the slightly cloudy dark amber brew. Frothy head recedes ever so slowly, with thick coating lace. Aroma is spiced malty sweetness. Taste begins with a sweet flavor reminiscent of root beer, then gets the spicy yeast character through the close. Small bubbles are smooth over the tongue, and the drinkability is very nice.

Hazy medium-brownish beer. I think the beer was ugly and the head was superb.  S-Light aroma, predominantly phenols, mostly clovey, with yeasty aromas as well.  T-Creamy flavors with bready malts and sweet/fruity nuances. Some yeast flavor, from bottle conditioning. At times, the flavor seemed just a bit plain.  M-Carbonation felt much smoother, almost a silky or creamy character, which surprised me. Body was medium to medium-light.  D-I think this beer was pretty ok.

S: moderately soft and fruity with notes of ripe apples and fresh pears being the most distinguishable.  T: The initial flavor yielded a fresh fruitiness from the Belgian yeast of apples and pears similar to the nose. A great carbonation factor brings supporting flavors of bananas and tart oranges rounding out the beer. Overall a fruity, spritzy Belgian that drank very nicely.  M: light but lively and fizzy from the heavy carbonation bringing out a light sour fruitiness on the tongue of apples and pears once again which faded quickly with only a slight lingering reminder leaving you looking forward to the next sip.

22,33,Reagan1984,4.29,"Thin wispy white head forms and fades immediately. A thin layer of white foam remains atop of the beer. It almost has a purple tint to it since it's so thin. You are really seeing the beer through it. The beer is a deep ruby amber color. Very deep and inviting color. Not much in the way of lacing....  Aroma is dark, fruity and tart. You can certainly sense the Belgian style yeast in its sharpness. I get some peach, cherries. The more it warms the aroma opens even more and you get a real earthy quality to this.  Deep, smooth and balanced flavor. Starts with some wonderful fruits. A still get peaches, and some pear. The yeast notes are certainly present and bring a nice spicy nature to the flavor. Some white grape? Maybe. I'm quite surprised by the delicate nature of this beer. I thought this was going to be a big bold sweet thick Belgian. It's deep, but completely different than I had imagined. Towards the end, there really is a nice hop bitterness that makes an appearance. At first you don't even realize it's there, then it hits you. I drank about ½ the beer without any food, then had some blue cheese, pear and crackers. It was fantastic how much the flavor changed with these. I could all of a sudden taste more of the malt backbone. Later as I drank the last part with the sediment, it really reminded me of a great apple cider..  Mouth feel is almost of champagne with a little more body. The carbonation brings this mouth to life. Very delicate on the palette. Very drinkable and refreshing. The alcohol is rather well hidden. A bit dry..",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The lacing is incredible. The aroma is spicy and fruity. There is a sweet and sour note from the malt. The hops are fruity and there are notes of cinnamon, paprika and peppercorns. It's slightly bready and carries a dank air. The chewy medium-full body is velvety soft. It coats like medicine. The finish is possibly slightly silty, but overall, it's smoother than water. The sweetness never breaks through, which is nice. There's a huge prune flavor with figs, cassis, black cherry and licorice. It comes off as somewhat medicinal. It's an elixir. The bitterness reinforces the Rx later in the taste. The alcohol is warming. Magnifique! (rated Sep 4, 2007)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smell- sweet white grapes, apples, malt, yeast, alcohol and flowers are all in there together.  Taste- sweet, with apples and white grapes, then dry and earthy, nearly musty taste, swallows sweet and white grape-y, followed by a long, not-strong but noticeable musty aftertaste; almost like duck, or dark meat turkey; maybe slightly smokey? Very interesting.  Mouthfeel- carbonation is plentiful, and crisp on the tongue, the beer itself is silky and smooth. The contrast is similar to the contrasting sweet-and-smokey flavors.  Drinkability- the enticing flavor combination, and the perfectly matched texture combination make this a beer that is hard to leave sitting down.

22,33,MattCote,4.6,"Purchased a 22 Oz. bomber at Trader Joes and drank it that night, having chilled it to around 55 degrees farenheit. Drank it out of a Duvel Belgian glass.  A - Pours into a smoothe tawny, perhaps a bit of a deep mahogany, much as a dark belgian should. Two finger head dissolves into intricate lacing along the glass.  S - Immediate aroma of honey, like smelling a dilluted mead from afar. Hints of fresh fruit and lively notes of malt present.  T - Initially, the smooth and definitively Belgian maltiness presents itself with a bushel of fruits-- perhaps apple or pear-- with just enough flavor to disguise the 8% abv. Does so with flying colors. Resolves into a prudent hops profile, leaving a pleasant aftertaste.  M - Best described as a bit chewy, just enough resistance to prevent a watery feel, not enough to give it the same viscous consistency of a thicker style of beer. Remained as such throughout the drinking session without divesting too much carbonation.  D - Overall, a bomber is enough to satisfy the palette. It is certainly a force to be reckoned with, and may leave you feeling pretty well off if you solo the bottle. The flavor and aroma stays with you for a while beyond the final sip, which serves as a valuable reminder that you need to pick up another bomber. ASAP.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,magictrokini,4.2,"Pours mahogany with a thick head. Aroma of yeast, banana, and cherry. Tastes like a tripel with an earthy/apple bite at the end. The carbonation makes it lighter than expected. Highly recommended. Unibroue is a master at keeping a Beligan full-flavored and full-bodied without overwhelming.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Stonebreaker,4.32,"Appearance: Devilishly dark red with a thin head but a steady fizz. No lacing to speak of.  Smell: Sweet figs, a touch of lemon zest, esters galore, you fabulous belgian yeast.  Taste: Dryer than the trois pistoles, a little lemon zest, very smooth sweet fig, a wee bit of chocolate in the back, warming alcohol. Weee!  Mouthfeel: A sort of thin, fizzy feel I suppose is to style.  Drinkability: Sip away.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,popery,3.72,"I will try to come back to this beer and review it again. I tried it against three other Unibroue beers, and they all seemed to suffer from the comparison. Usually, tasting beers this way brings the differences to the forefront, but this time, they all just grew closer and closer together as far as flavor went. In my very humble opinion, Maudite is a Unibroue beer first and a Belgian Strong Dark Ale second, and that might go for all of their beers with their respective styles. Considering, Unibroue doesn't really seem to use normal style names in their marketing, this probably isn't an offensive opinion to them.  Anyway, Maudite pours a dark red brown with a very small fizzy head that disappeared almost immediately, leaving just about zero lacing. Part way through my glass, I spent some time swirling up a little head and watching it disappear almost instantly, just to be sure I didn't just give it a bad initial pour. It's not a horrible looking beer but decidedly unexciting for the style.  The smell and flavor were better. Spice, somewhere between pepper and coriander seed, is particularly evident, at least compared to other Unibroue offerings. There are some interesting pine or spruce hop notes in the background. The delicacy of the hop flavor is a very nice touch. The taste is also earthy and fruity, in line with Unibroue's range. I always enjoy the Unibroue feel of fine, prickly carbonation.  I really don't mean to be down on Unibroue. I like their beers very much. I just wasn't expecting such marked similarity.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,HalfFull,4.03,"Pours a hazy orange amber into a large Burgundy glass. Offers a rich head and a nice Belgian nose, good retention and lacing and a steady surface carbonation.  Nose offers a hint of alcohol yet is quite endearing. Otherwise subtle malts and fruit combine with a strong Belgian yeast nose.  Taste is a bit perky with carbonation and offers a slight breadiness coupled with hints of fresh summer fruit with a notable pear sweetness in the close.  Feel is of a very well balanced carbonation and sweetness and yields an easy drinking strong ale. Very nice..",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,oriolesfan4,3.13,"Man, Unibroue has had 7 chances to impress me so far and has yet to do so.. I'm starting to think I just don't have the taste for their particular yeast strain. I have one more left after this (their tripel) so hopefully that can do the trick.  This one pours a cloudly light brown with a small head and no lacing. Taste is very spicy with some dark fruit flavors, but mostly ethanol comes through with the spice. Has a smooth aftertaste surprisingly but getting to that point is a pretty rough road. I wouldn't recommend this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,HatTrick,4.08,"I've had this beer both on-tap and from the bottle but today I'll just review from the bottle though on-tap it is exceptional. If all you have is a regular glass then that's ok but is best in a chalice.  Appearance: Nice golden red amber color with carbonated buttles. Cream colored head quickly reduces down to a paper thin top. Leaves a little lacing as time goes on.  Smell: Of honey, yeast, and a little of spices like cloves.  Taste: A sweet flavor with honey and citrus undertones paired with cloves and cinnamon.  Mouthfeel: Light-bodied with perfect carbonation levels.  Drinkability: Easy easy easy to drink. Glad it comes in such a large bottle as one glass isn't enough. Makes me think of humid-sun drenched cabanas with Cuban cigars and a chalice of beer. Mmmm, and I don't smoke either. Overall a great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,Vendetta,3.44,"Original Rating Date: June 22, 2008  Quality beer, but Belgian really isn't my style. That being said, the aroma and flavor are both very good- above average- for the Belgians that I've tried. Laid back, fruity aroma that's enticing. The taste is that of typical Belgian, but high quality. Lots of maltiness, banana, tropical tasting. Very laid back save for a bit of alcoholic bite at the end which is a little surprising for an 8% ABV beer. Fans of this style beer will love it. For me, it'll probably be the last one I try. Just can't get into them. Maybe I'll revisit some more Unibroue beverages later on, but right now I just can't seem to develop the taste for them.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,ecoastman,4.28,"Appearance - dark brown-gold with a light haze. fine champagne-like carbonation similar to La Fin du Monde. A good looking ale.  Smell - mild tones are sweet, spicy and yeasty with some fruity esters. I may not be using the best glass since I'm using the Stella Artois type. I think a chalice is a must.  Taste - mild like the smell but complex and low bitterness. It seems well balanced since no distict character is hitting me directly. I'm really enjoying this beer but I'm having a hard time describing it in layman's terms...I'm picking up traditional belgium ale type tones and perhaps some pear. The alcohol is slightly noticeable in the finish. Seems like it's brewed to fit the style - very nice.  Mouthfeel - medium body and well carbonated.  Drinkability - This beer is very easy to drink but you need to be careful in this alcohol range!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,cleeze,4.42,"Now I've always stayed away from Unibroue simply because it's a Canadian brewer (I know sounds ignorant, and probably is) since I've always had a little Vendetta against them. But jesus these Canucks sure know how to brew, eh?  The appearence was a copper almost a wood tone, like the color of the stain on my house. Frothy at start but the head disappeared rather quickly.  The smell is probably my favorite feature of this brew. A nice sweet malty smell with a touch of fruitiness. My nose also picked up on hint of spice too. Quite pleasent. Also there is an undeniable trace of an alcohol on the nose as well  Now talk about complexity. Malty goodness up front with a little bit of fruitiness on the tongue. Then a quick bit of spice and hoppiness mixed up in there as well. For all those great flavors it's really well rounded.  Overall I wish I would have Tried this amazing Canuck brew earlier. I really enjoyed it, reminded me of Stone's Arrogant Bastard. Really smooth for 8%",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

There was no real head on the beer, just a faint covering of bubbles. It almost appeared flat. The bubbles seemed to try to cause some lacing but the bubbles would just slide back down the glass.  S: I can't put my finger on the aroma of this one. There seems to be some sort of dark fruit aroma mixed in with malt and spicy aromas.  T: The taste mirrors the aroma.  M: The in mouth carbonation is a bit aggressive for my tastes. It almost seems astringent. It has a medium body.  D: The odd after taste, aggressive carbonation, and ABV make this one a bit of a slow go for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Complex aroma; sweet, rich malt with fruity overtones and a bit of peppery spiciness. Flavor follows suit - nutty, sweet malt with a hint of spice; a bit of alcohol warmth toward the end, but not hot. Highly carbonated, light on the tongue, medium body, finishes more dry than sweet.

22,33,BierFan,3.55,Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a cervoise.  Appearance: Poured a very dark amber with an off white head. The head is very large but it doesn't stick around for long. No lacing.  Smell: Some fruity apple aroma but the smell is dominated by a big alcohol spiciness.  Taste: Taste is much like the smell but the alcohol is more subdued.  As a duvel clone this is rather disappointing. All of the elements of the smell and taste are there but it's not as well put together as Duvel. The alcohol is far too strong whereas in Duvel the alcohol doesn't detract from the experience.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

As it warms, a little fruit comes through the spice. M: Highly attenuated, with lots of tingly carbonation (or maybe all the carbonation makes it seem highly attenuated, I can't decide), drying, seems to coat the tongue. D: The alcohol is very well hidden. This goes down a little too easy, I could easily reach for another 2 or 3 but the alcohol would make that dangerous. Excellent beer, highly recommended.

22,33,Vixie,4.32,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Duvel glass. Poured a cloudy reddish orange color with a a bit of a tan colored head. Not as pretty as some beers I've had, but not bad.  The smell of this is very potent. I don't have the best sense of smell, but this one has one of the strongest smells of any beer I've tried. The smell is on the sweet side, reminds me of what you'd smell if you were baking a cake and opened the oven door while it was baking.  The taste of this one was hard for me to pin down. There is a lot going on here, to me it was mainly spice. definite fruit notes, with a lot of clove like flavors as well. Possibly the spiciest beer I have ever tasted.  Mouthfeel was solid, nothing timid about this brew.  I found this to be very drinkable, although one I have to sip slowly. The spiciness lends itself to slow sipping, and the alcohol content limits how much I can drink at once. If you are looking for something a little different, this is the beer for you. A very good brew from Unibroue, give this one a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The smell is of wonderfully familiar Belgian yeast. I wish I could bottle the aroma of Belgian beer yeast and turn it into an air freshener. A nice caramel-style malt backbone is there too.  The flavor is impacted greatly by the yeast. Bready and spicy. Malty and a little fruity. Goddamn, it's delicious.  Mouthfeel is a little beyond medium with the dry finish one would expect out of a good Belgian-style ale.  8% abv? You could have fooled me. I would attempt to drink this stuff all night if I didn't know it would have me on the floor after a handful of bottles. Good play, you crazy French Canadians.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S: Apple cider, belgian style yeasts, slightly metallic scent, sort of a brown sugar/mulled spices smell, and somewhat peachey.  T: Really stands out in my mind more as a dubbel than a strong dark, flavors of banana and cloves really pop into the forefront. Slightly peppery from the yeasty notes. This is really complex. Apples. Cider. Mulled spices. A lot of the smells follow through into the taste.  M: Thin, and watery, this is right on par with the style. Lightly carbonated, goes down very smooth. Pretty spicy feeling from the alcohol as it goes down.  D: Its really right up there, goes down easy, very smooth, and easily drinkable for the abv.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,flipper2gv,4.29,"A: Pours in a dark amber color. Hazy because of the yeast still in the bottle. Two inches head that fades fast to a simple crown.  S: Caramel, bread, dark fruits and spices (pepper and cloves), orange peel and a nice flowery/herbal bouquet.  T: Very interesting taste. Starts with a lot malt sweetness. Then, it's all about the spices. Pepper and cloves are dominant in this part. Finally, the caramel and dark fruits kick in with a nice flowery taste thanks to the hops. Very interesting taste that is not exaggerated by the flavors, balanced taste. Strange metallic aftertaste is the only thing lowering this.  M: Medium to high. Carbonation is also medium to high (which is a little too much to my taste). The beer starts out with a medium mouthfeel and high carbonation then becomes creamy with a lot less carbonation. A transition in mouthfeel that is very similar to the one present in the Fin Du Monde.  D: High, but the boose will stop you from getting too much.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S: It had a bready and yeasty aroma with sweet caramel malts, dark pepper spice and hints of dark fruit and alcohol.  T: It hits with a malty bomb of sweet, creamy yeast and caramel. It has an abundant amount of sweet dark fruits (plums, figs, raisins) and more than a dash of tangy spices (peppers, cloves). The flavors are well integrated and balanced.  M: It is full bodied with a creamy, rich and sweet front and spicy, warm and clean back. Decent carbonation and a very clean aftertaste.  D: I really enjoyed the complex, distinct and rich flavors.

It was somewhat thick with some carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a fairly complex and clean flavor, although it had too much sour yeast for my liking. It had good body and was fairly easy to drink. I would have liked a maltier character that also could have hid the alcohol a bit better.

22,33,djeucalyptus,4.05,"Pours an intriguing murky dusty roan color, glowing of lemon and orange when held to the light. A light pour yielded a beautiful creamy two-finger head of an off-white color that faded fairly quickly, leaving a beautiful ring of foam and a thin lacing dancing across the top. Not a significant amount of lacing following down the glass.  aroma is spicy, yeasty, bready, and fruity. Candy sugars provide a backbone for the aroma, aiding in the blending of the other facets. Complex and strong aroma.  Whoah. Complex up the proverbial wazoo. Sweet on the tongue, with sugar and syrupy fruit notes up front. Caramel melon, some citrus, and red apple fade as the bread and yeast flavors take over. As the bottom of the bottle is neared, the yeast grows more dominant. Some alcohol is definitely present, but blends into the fruit notes so it hides fairly well. An array of spices I can barely begin to pick out rounds out the palette.  Mouthfeel is damn near perfect (no pun intended). Smooth like none other, it feels near-perfect in the mouth. Heavy and almost a touch on the thick side, the carbonation keeps it creamy and full. The sweetness can be felt on the tongue, as can the alcohol and yeast drying.  Unbelievably drinkable given the nature of the beast and it's abv. It's a pleasure to consume, and it seems to be returning the favor. Definitely one of my favorite Unibroue brews that I've tried.

22,33,Jmamay22,3.27,Maudite pours a ruddy dark brown with a greyish white foam. The head settles to a thick collar. Complex and enjoyable aroma consists of sweet fruit such as dark cherries and figs laced with candy sugar. White pepper and alcohol provide a balancing zip.  The spice and alcohol sharpness is far more pronounced in the taste. Some of the more interesting complexities of the fruit is lost in an initial rush of candy sugar and emphatic finish of spice and alcohol. A shame because the nose showed real promise. Fine and voluptuous carbonation due to the sugar. A little too much even for a Belgian. Spice and alcohol seems to overwhelm making this less drinkable.

Alcohol and yeast are definately present in the back. First thing I get is the spices all over the place. The malt and hops are definately not the showcase here. A lot of flavours, fruits, esters...  Mouthfeel is very crisp, even though I drank this beer quite warm. The body is pretty heavy in my opinion.

S: strong yeast in this one, with some spices and fruit undertones. I can definitely make out apple in there as well as dark fruits.  T: The yeast comes out even more in the mouth than it hints at in the nose. I am also getting a lot of spice in here, but it doesn't overwhelm the beer, which in my eyes, is the key to any spiced beer. There are hints of muted caramel, and as would be expected, you can pick up all the fruits that you could make out in the smell.  M/D: Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with low to medium carbonation.

Sweet and malty, like molasses and heavy wheat bread. Some muted spice and a hint of citrus.

A nice malty, whole wheat bread backbone, very fruity, (as I said, red apples) also has some red grapes, slightly banana and clove in the yeast. Very nice! Taste begins sweet, apples bread, clove... then transitions into a balancing act full of that wonderful spicy Unibroue yeast, grape juice, white pepper, raspberry.

The head settled quickly leaving a thin ring with little lacing. Smells of malt and fruit with no single strong scent. The taste is similar: Malty and sweet. Some caramel, some bitterness, and yeast rounds out the taste. Not a very strong taste of alcohol. Very well balanced taste. A fizzy mouthfeel that leaves some stickiness but drinks real easy. I will definitely buy some of this...it's a delicious beer and easy to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,rushpatrick,4.6,"On many occasions i have had this beer from a 750ml corked bottle. This was my first experience tasting it on draft. It blew my mind. i cannot immagine anything tasting better. While the beer still had little smell and a somewhat murky appearance, it proved to be better tasting than anything I've had to date. I brew my own beer and only dream of the day when I one day can brew something one tenth this good. Keep in mind I am impartial to this drink and would never say anything negative about it. Drink on.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Hokies,4.31,12oz bottle poured into an os wine glass. Pours an deep opaque brown color with a huge two inch off white head and lace.  Belgian yeast and some dark fruits with a nice amount of spice.  Taste is really nice as it starts with a nice spiciness to it. Their is some raisin flavor with some figs a light caramel malt flavor and spicy clove flavor in it. The alcohol is well hidden in this brew.  A very nice beer with deceptive alcohol and a smooth feel to it allows for an easy drinking brew.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,daythree16,4.2,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter. Foamy .5 finger caramel colored head that leaves some lace as it fades.  Smell is caramel, raisins, and that distinctly sweet Belgian yeasty aroma. Taste is sweet, candied fruit with some spicy and earthy yeast flavors.  Medium body with crisp mouthfeel. Drinkability is very high. Definitely one of my favorites of this style. It's not a problem at all to put away the whole 750ml bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,katan,3.63,"12 oz undlated bottle - bottle refermentation it says  A - Pours a solid copper color, lots of carbonation and head. The head is very white and strongly retained. Looks almost thick.  S - Primarily a strong yeast here. Not much else - i would say it owns. A Belgian yeast of some kind - somewhere along the lines of a strong ale or a tripel.  T - The early flavors are very subdued. Light amount of malt with some roasted malt background. The majority of this thing is in the after taste. Very strong malt flavor combined with an extremely potent hit of phenolic flavors. This baby packs a punch.  M - Solid and thick - and thats just the start. This beer is extremely carbonated. High CO2 means burn on the tongue.  D - The more I drink it the more I slow down - why? Its the overpowering alcohol combined with the huge carbonation creating a backup in my gut. Sounds nasty, but its true. Not a particularly drinkable beer, but not exactly what they are going for here.  Had this in an unreviewed session on tap quite a ways back - I think for some odd reason I liked it much better than this bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TeamSeabass,4.33,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a tulip shaped beer glass. I left a small bit in the bottle but most of the yeast was mixed into the beer on pouring.  Has a beautiful caremel color and slight head. Smells more fruity to me than some other belgian style ales that are heavier on the cloves.  Delightful taste with such a smooth mouthfeel, with a nice bit of carbonation. The alcohol comes through at the very end but the finish is so smooth.  This beer is good right to the very end of the glass.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Offa,4.85,"This is delicious, interesting, complex and very fruity.  Dark, reddish amber with a little brown and just a tiny bit hazy, it has a large, lasting, creamy, light tan head that slowly thins to a thin, permanent top and leaves some decent lace, but not for long.  The aroma is spiced, sweet red wine with a lot of fruit, bread, orange juice, hints of yeast and pear.  The taste is very fruity (both fresh and stewed dried fruit), rich but light and zesty, with spice, orange, hint of caramel, yeasty. It's complex, lively, and zesty, with the alcohol providing a nice, warming body without being obvious or at all harsh.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,giblet,4.35,"very nice brew. poured nicely with about one inch of head. nice full color, steady carbonation. smell and taste is nice and fruity. this is one damn fine beer from a very good brewer. nice feel in the mouth and while full in body it finishes very smooth and clean. you can lightly taste and feel the abv.  suckem up and movem out.  giblet",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,gerardoluna,3.7,"[EYES] This ""damned one"" was amazing, deep in eyes, the head is poor for this style [BSA], [MOUTH] Strong in mouth, [AROMA] Full in nouse and the finish is bitter and the after taste dry. GooOooOoooOod One for me! enjoy it with pat metheny back.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,disastermouse,4.4,"I've got to start by saying that this has been a favorite beer of mine even before I started really getting into beer. I first discovered it about seven years ago and found it refreshingly different.  A- Dark reddish-brown, but not opaque. It looks great!  S- Smells very 'bubble-gum' fruity. There's malt there underneath, but not a 'bready' smell at all. The alcohol is definitely there.  T- Yum! Very fruity, not much hops, with the malt way in the background - even behind the alcohol heat.  MF- This beer sort of 'dances' across your tongue. It feels like it's a combination between the phenols and the alcohol. It's actually quite pleasant - but different. It's not astringent.  D- The alcohol content is high on this one. Personally, I have to buy the 12oz bottles in order to drink it if I want to also drink other beers. Also, it may numb your tongue up a bit.  All in all, a very fine beer. It's complex and unexpected. If, in my youth, someone had told me beer could taste like this I wouldn't have believed them.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,andrewm190,4.35,"Great beer; and I have to be honest in that I haven't poured it into the proper glass. Nonetheless, the smell is delicious, solid yeast smell, I think. Pours a dark brown with a powerful head. In no way overbearing, well balanced and comfortable to drink. This is an excellent beer, and I highly recommend it. Be warned, it is a bit pricey, even at Trader Joe's, but I do think you will really like the results.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mnj21655,4.1,"12 oz. bottle poured into my Orval chalice  Pours a murky reddish brown in color with lighter ambers hues at the edges an about a finger of very light tan head that settles to just a coating. Aroma is pleasant, spicy phenols with intermittent whiffs of alcohol and a touch of fruit. Taste is much like the aroma there is some malt and darker fruits upfront with spicy, slightly peppery phenols taking over. In the finish I can detect some alcohol but not a detrimental amount. Mouthfeel is good, medium+ body with moderate carbonation. Overall this is a fairly enjoyable brew, a bit more complex than I was able to put into words but not too ""busy"".",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jcdiflorio,4.18,"12oz brown bottle with a gold foil wrapper around the cap best by 08/29/09. Served into a Chimay chalice. Cloudy light cidery color deep golden with reddish brown hues,very effervecent with a silky white head leaving a constiant layer tiny strings around the sides of the glass.  Clean,light spice,yeasty with doughyness,touch of cinnamon fruity with hints of dates/figs.  Light tangy mouthfeel lots of spice upfront,good balance with a tart,slightly sour fruityness not as much as the aroma would indicate,with a touch of acidity. Slighty boozy for the most part the alcohol is well hidden. Velvety,silky mouthfeel leaves a drying slightly astrigent aftertaste lingering. Good example of the style close to Chimay Blue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bonkers,3.83,"I split a 7650 ml bottle into 2 large goblets. It pours a almost burgundy color. The head is about 2 fingers, does not leave much lacing. On the nose is mild ripe fruit and some alchoholic esters, but rather faint. There are ripe pear and faint apple notes on the tongue followed by a mellow alchohol. This is a medium bodied beer with adequete carbonation. This brew hides its 8% alchohol well making it very drinkable. This beer is solid, yet unspectacular.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,boralyl,3.62,"A - Pours 2 fingers of off-white head that fizzles down pretty quickly leaving a ring. It appears to have a lot of carbonation. It is dark copper in color.  S - A sweet aroma, mostly dark fruits like plums and grapes.  M - Light-medium bodied beer with a lot of carbonation.  T - Slightly sour up front but balanced with some malts and a spiciness. Leaves a little alcohol warmth. It's hard to get a whole lot out of the taste, because of the strong carbonation sting that overpowers everything else.  A pretty decent brew, but to me it is nothing extraordinary. It's worth checking out, but I wouldn't go out of your way to get it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Patrick999,4.01,"On-tap at the Abbey.  A - Nice burgundy body, decent head, though again, the bartender didn't want to cheat me, so poured less head than it otherwise would be.  S - I didn't get so much other than some vague raisins and spices. Maybe my nose is having a bad day...it's not congested at all, but I'm not getting much out of any beer I have today.  T - Really tasty, a toasted graham cracker with a lot of clove evident. I didn't get anywhere near this much clove when I tried Maudite out of the bottle. As with the bottle, I'm not sure I can tell I'm drinking an alcoholic drink, that's how hidden the 8% ethanol is.  F - Medium body, but a deft, light feel that reminds me of some of the best Belgian examples.  D - Strong beer, but you could toss back a couple.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,koolk,4.2,"Pours a dark burnt orange with a fluffy white head that disintegrates soon after.  Sexy Belgian inspired nose of cherries and currant and other dark/red fruits, strong spice and some citrus under notes.  Palate is full of sweet caramel flavours that lead into a decent spicy bite and aftertaste. Some more citrus flavours in there as well, or maybe that is just the after taste tang making me think so. Great flavour!  Great balance, creamy texture and the alcohol is apparent, though in a loverly winter warming fashion.  Ahh Unibroue...Their beers played a huge part in my beer geek ""initiation"" as a 19 year old living in Canada. Good to see after all these years it still holds very strong (and is available in Oz for that matter!)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Jwale73,4.1,"One of my first forays into craft beer about 12 years ago and I'm finally getting around to reviewing it. 12oz. bottle served in my Maudite tulip. Poured a murky plum color with a two inch rocky off-white cap. A furious, initial effervescing of tiny bubbles began to slow in tandem with the subtle collapse of the head, which eventually settled into a fairly consistent skim of foam. Some lacing present during the tasting, but poor adhesion. Complex nose; dark fruit (perhaps prunes & plum) as well as a spicy character and perhaps a hint of candi sugar. Taste follows nose with some citrus astringency revealed, culminating in a dry finish. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied but seems to be slightly overcarbonated. A nice, drinkable belgian strong dark. Alcohol is well-hidden, and body keeps it from feeling overly heavy. Fairly easy drinking brew, relative to the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,elniko,4.3,"Poured into snifter from bottle  A: Slightly transparent but still dark, almost cola like. Half finger of head that dissipated. Good looking brew.  S: I picked up tones of fruit with a touch of spiciness as swell.  T & M: Wow, I really liked this beer. Alcohol is very subtle. I'm getting used to the Belgian dark ales now but it still surprises me how light and refreshing they are. Bready mouthfeel. Hints of fruit with some spiciness as well. Well done.  D: Highly drinkable, I really enjoyed this beer. Unibroue continues to impress.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,alovesupreme,4.18,"Served in a Unibroue glass.  A.Dark brown a little purple in color. 1 1/2 finger head good retention. S.unidentified fruits, and spices. T.Lots of flavor, fruits,spices, malty. M.Tons of carbination, thin but works out well with the beer. D.Alcohol is hidden very well, beware, drink multiple and they will sneak up on you.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,changeup45,3.07,Brown-orange color that poured with absolutely no head at all. The aroma is spiced vanilla with quite a bit of yeast. The taste is spicy vanilla and citrusy then turning pretty sour and peppery at the end. There's some noticeable alcohol as well. Not a bad beer.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,philipquarles,1.75,"12oz bottle cellared for two years. Pours a lightly hazy brown with very ruby tinges. Tall, fluffy light tan head that holds very well. Sickeningly sweet aromas of caramelized apples and blueberries. Some slightly spicy yeast notes. Very artificial smell. The taste is cloying and medicinal. Various dark fruit syrups mixed with Robitussin. Slightly astringent finish. Warming. Full body with good carbonation. This just tastes incredibly fake; like watered-down Pepsi with Juicy-juice and some brandy added. Had this at least three times, and each time it's gone down the drain...it's pretty evident why they called it 'maudite'.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,thekevlarkid,4.68,"A semi-cloudy color like dark maple syrup or wood stain. Pours frothy as heck (almost too much- settle down boy!) creating a deep, thick tan cap of medium sized bubbles. It eventually relaxes into a nice cap that clings to the glass. Great retention though very little lacing. Spicy aromas complimented by sweet malts. And what a taste! Complex and deep. A quick coffee snap at the beginning, then black pepper, toasted malts, balancing hops, some citrus and general fruit. Exactly what a Belgium strong should be. Smooth, med to light carbonation and easy to drink. Lingering finish. Especially because you can't tell how strong it is. Goddamn. A beer for all occasions and all drinkers. Such a consistently amazing company I have trouble not feeling biased. Truly a stellar offering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,philbe311,3.77,"A - Light carbonation is visible through the translucent redish rust colored body... Pure ivory head disipates leaving an elegant lace on top... Coats glass well...  S - Pears... Assorted other dried fruit... Tartness is present on the nose... Spicy notes are present but understated...  T - A little on the bland side for a Belgian Ale with such a robust boquet... Apples, raisons, and pears... Alcohol...  M - Crisp... Good bit of carbonation with each sip... Dry...  D - Solid, but uninspiring Belgian Ale... I would never turn one away, but not sure I'd recommend one either...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,atsprings,4,"Pours a somewhat crisp dark brown with a decent head that diminishes to a thin layer. Aroma is a nice blend of brown sugar, dried fruits and Belgian yeast. The taste is heavy on the fruit with a distinct sourness that is only slightly countered by sweet brown sugar. The beer is medium bodied with plenty of warming alcohol. This one is certainly an enjoyable sipper.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ectomorph,4.37,"750ml bottle poured into a pint glass.  A - With a slight chill haze, this pours a dark copper (think old penny) with lively carbonation. The finger thick off white head refuses to dissipate.  S - Sweet candy and fruit smell is balanced by a slight spice I can't place. Some flowers?  T - Great brew. Hints of apricots and maybe molasses are balanced on the end with a little pepper spice and alcohol warmth. I like this very much.  M - Excellent body and very crisp. Little nose tickle.  D - Great session brew. I will be buying these again for sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,gonzo46and2,4.2,"On tap at Tanks Taproom in Tampa. Pours a ruby red with a fluffy white head. Amazing aroma of brown sugar, roasted malt, and apple pie. Soft foamy head like it was a nitro pour (it wasn't) with a bubbly mouthfeel. Taste is of pie and german hefe yeast. Kinda like a hefe with more slightly different spices and esters. Really tasty beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,pleasewearpants,4.03,"Poured a nice light-brown amber color with a two-finger head that settled down after a minute or two. The nose was pleasant, with a yeasty smell and maybe a few peaches somewhere in there. First sip was fantastic.  Everything great about this beer just kind of blossomed all at once but in a really clean way. And then right at this apex of flavor, it was gone! This beer just skips across the palate then fizzles away leaving an extremely pleasant effervescence. After a few sips the alcohol can be tasted when you exhale. Still very clean.  I really enjoyed drinking this liquid. I couldn't get a grasp on any over-powering flavors but the taste is very nice. Brutal label too.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,GodOfBeer,4.29,"A very nice murky dark brown colour with a thin head that dissipates into a thin lace.  Smells of bananas, yeast, dried fruit and a bit sour.  Tastes a bit sour and yeasty upfront, raisins, bananas and some nice spices balance it out, a very nice Belgian ale.  A nice light mouthfeel, lightly carbonated and a pretty drinkable beer at 8.00% that leaves me wanting more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,treyrab,4.15,"Poured into a chalice...  A: Raisin brown colored with nice off-white creamy head that lasts a good bit. Very murky and hazy with definite active carbonation.  S: The smell is very similar to most dark belgian ales...Raisin, dates, candi sugar, yeast, and bananas are what stick out.  T: The taste is similar and actually very crisp. The flavor is complex and very nice.  Overall, a great brew by Unibroue, but not one of my favorite of theirs",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Kraken,3.68,"Purchsed by GF, she butchered the name so bad I was unsure of what she was going to bring home. Poured from a corked and caged 750ml into a standard pint glass. Beer pours a very cloudy brown with cascading sheets of white foam. Massive head 5 fingers at least. May have been a bit cold when initlally poured. Good head retention and not much lace to speak of. Nose- This smelled a bit like rotting wood, slightly sour, with nuances of over ripe fruit. Taste- Tastes a bit like the nose, rotting wood, lite sourness, earthyness. Booze is well hidden. Mouthfeel- Interesting but a bit thin. Drinkability- Very drinkable once you get past the sour bits. However sours are not my bag. On the plus side its readily available",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BWH3,3.72,"Appearance: Hazelnut brown in color. Clarity is translucent not opaque. Pours vigorously carbonated and heady beer. Champagne like fizz settles the head into a thin creamy ring that clings to the sides of the glass.  Smell: Bready, cake batter sweat aroma. Some raisin notes with a good contribution of spice and esters as well as the solvent like quality of the high EtOH.  Taste: A touch bland. A tart almost sour quality from the yeast initiates the taste. A hint of caramel and slight raisin transitions in, but much of the flavor is dominated by the spiciness and heat of the phenols and alcohol. A small component of hops bitterness precedes the fire of these components. It all ends with a nice spiciness on the lips.  Mouthfeel: Exceptionally crisp, light medium body. Head retention is too poor for my liking.  Drinkability: The best of the Unibroue beers thus far. I am looking forward what is too come. Now when this beer really hit the seen, I would have been in high school. This beer would have challenged me in extreme ways and I clearly understand why Unibroue is still so highly regarded.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MTNboy,4.42,"Appearance- This beer has a great hazy red color. The head is slightly off white and thick and forms an almost perfect lace.  Smell- Sweet and spicy with some fruit tones. As with most of their beers there is that fine malt bread aroma.  Taste- It is Unibroue. Sweet, rich somewhat fruity and wine like. Some what bitter at the end  Mouthfeel. Full and sticky. A little carbonation burn but not bad.  Drinkability- This beer is awesome.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,orangemoustache,4.77,"Pours a hazy/cloudy/murky reddish orange with a medium sized fluffy tan head that leaves surprisingly no lacing,the beautiful coloring makes up for it's vacancy. The nose is spicy,sweet(cinnamon applesauce)and malty. The flavors are quite complex,yet never overbearing. Lots of spicy yeast and hints of apple cider,dark fruits and burnt cinnamon toast(yummy stuff). Smoothe and warming,delicate carbonation,and a long flavorful alcohol finish. For such a high AVB this has a drinkability that is off the charts.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,everetends,4.08,"12oz bottle I got at a gas station down the street from the resort I am staying at here in Quebec. Poured into a wine glass.  A: Pours a hazy light brown that has orange notes when held to light. Had a nice white head that diminished to a frothy ring and spotty top cap that produced some nice soapy lacing.  S: Smells mostly of malt, a touch of hops and some fruit I can't make out. Alcohol does have a bit of a slap in the face note on the nose.  T: Taste is of malt is like a sweet bread, earthy, grassy notes, pears, apples, raisins. Alcohol is there but I think it rounds out the flavors amazingly well. Has a great balance.  M: Medium bodied brew that has some bubbly carbonation to it. Notes of apple and pear really stick to your tongue and last long in the after taste. Just a touch of alcohol burn on the back of the throat.  D: Very drinkable. This is another hit from Unibroue. Very tasty and easy going down for a big beer. The ABV doesn't hold this guy back at all. Could use a little more in the nose department but still a great beer. Prost.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,burnstar,4.49,"Pours dark brown with a medium white head. Looks kind of like apple cider. Some lacing on the surface but it dissipates quickly. Aroma is apples and dark fruits. Brown sugar, plums, and raisins. Taste has many of the same notes as the aroma. Deep, dark fruit complexity with an underlying carmel sweetness. But not overly sweet. Well balanced. Somewhat earthy. Really nuanced and complex taste. Something of a sipping beer. Medium bodied and heavily carbonated. A pleasure to drink but not one to rush through. Taste gets better as it warms.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dstc,4.33,"Pours a hazy brown w/ nice white head. Head falls a bit then stays for whole glass with nice lacing.  Sweet malty aroma. Spicy and fruity with a bit of alcohol coming through.  Sweet malty taste with a nice alcohol warming affect. Hints of fruit, raisons maybe? Rather clean finish.  Full bodied and smooth in the mouth. Simple carbonation.  Very nice. Will add to my list of brews I want to drink often.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MyGoodness,4.47,"Awesomeness in a bottle. Pours a warm, hazy brown colour with a decent, foamy head and has a great aroma. It smells like a fresh loaf of bread somehow ended up in the glass. The taste is amazing. It was so much better than I thought it would be... it's not overwhelming, but it's hearty, yeasty, and seems somehow to be a crowd pleaser amoung my friends with very different tastes. The mouthfeel is perfect- smooth and thick-- it's what a beer should be. I was so surprised at how good this was. Highly recommend it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Kyle987,4.5,"Caramel brown color, with slightly hazy body and large head, which settles down but sticks around forever. Good lacing. Strong, amazing smell; very complex, sweet and yeasty. Similar flavor; wonderful, with lots of malts and yeastiness, with some clove. I agree with the previous two reviewers about the hop flavor without the hop bitterness, which is great. Smooth, enjoyable mouthfeel with higher-than-average carbonation. An amazing, perfectly drinkable beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,kzoobrew,4.18,"750 ml bottle best before 11-10-07 listed.  Pours a cider brown color. Carbonation leaves an aggressively foamy head out front. Subsides soon to leave a creamy frothy cap. Slight bubbly lacing.  Smell is quite malty almost bready. Maybe a raisin bread. Yeast and spice aroma hitting too.  taste is giving me something to think about. The are big fruit and spice notes up front. Earthy apple flavors mix well with the peepry spiciness and clove like flavors. No real bitterness picked up from the hops, but slight hoppy flavor.  Mouthfeel is oh so smooth, decently crisp. Creamy feel with decent amount of carbonation.  Very enjoyable. Not a brew you can drink alot of but one you can drink more than you notice. Exceptional",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,JoeMayo,4.43,"This beer is delicious out of the bottle, but even better on tap!  A- Pours a deep reddish-brown with a very thick head that dissipates to a soft foam after a minute.  S- The belgian influence is clear in this beer. Cloves, spice, yeast, and fruit are all very prounounced in the aroma. A slight floral scent comes through as well.  T- Well-constructed and delicious. Definately a complex blend of spice in the flavors. A yeasty flavor is noted. There is a certain crispness about this beer that makes it very refreshing for something so complex. A slight and unexpected hop flavor can be found in the aftertaste, however no hop bitterness.  M- Creamy, yet very highly carbonated  D- This is great to drink with friends, to serve with a meal (it goes with almost anything), or to simply enjoy and savor",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Pours with a thick layer of very light brown, fizzy head that settles quickly. S: Sugary and malty, mixed in with some earthy, fruity scents. Quite tempting. T: Again, sugars and malts. Flavors of apples, pears, spices, and a touch of yeast. M: A crisp ale feel with the softness of the fruits and yeast. Nice combination, a good satisfying feel. D: Pretty darn good. No taste of the 8% ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,corey0212,4.22,"Pours a murky iced-tea color, with a sand-colored head that settles nicely, and leaves patches of lacing on the glass. Smells sweet, moderate dark fruit, Belgian yeast aroma, a touch of banana. Taste is dry and fruity, some pear and green apple, some spice and brown sugar, clove. Really drying, almost tannic.

Great unibroue/belgian carbonation that keeps the high alcohol light.  for 8%, a great drinking beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,IBUnit63,4.27,"From 750 into Ommegang chalice...  Deep, cloudy mahogany color. Noted head to be intermittent between pours - the first dissipated quickly but the second was coffee ice-cream colored, about 1 finger thick and bountiful. Moderate visible carbonation.  Beautiful scent of malt, yeast, fermented raisins, maybe figs and spices. Solid malt backbone meshes nicely. With warmth, deeper caramel scents emerge - nice.  Clean with very very very slight horse blanket feel. Carbonation tingles nicely to make this lighter than expected while maintaining strong flavor profile - sweetness, alcohol and malt profile are nicely balanced.  This has a wonderful feel to it - deep and strong with very light tingle on mouth that cuts through, clarifies the essence extremely well. From start to finish this offering is hearty but clean.  'tis a good one. The heft from the alcohol and the huge package of flavors creates great, strong body but carbonation keeps it clean.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Appears a dark amber, almost mahogany, with a two finger off-white head that sticks around for a while  Aroma is similar to other Unibroue beers. Spicy, fruity, and a sweetness from the candi sugar.  Flavors of grapes, plums, a bit of peppery spice and a bit of sweetness lingering around all of that. Finishes fruity and spicy.  Medium bodied, high carbonation level, but insanely smooth and creamy. Dry finish.  Another excellent offering from Unibroue. This is one of my favorites that they make. Might have to pick up the larger bottle of it sometime.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Slatetank,4.42,"thanks to tenderbranson69 for picking this up for me! decanted from the twist off twelve oz brown bottle into my La fin Du Monde glass at 45 degress.  A - A chestnut brown shade w/ excellent clarity and dark amber hues at the base. The head shrinks from 3 fingers of whispy light tan that receds to about 1/4 inch w/ legs like bourbon and a tight bead.  S - A dark wheat aroma w/ candy sugar notes and grain odors w/ a slight brown sugar and toast aroma. The nose has a whiff of alcohol in it, but mainly sweet malt dominates w/ dark tones  M - Extremely high effervescent feel as it hits the tongue like pop rocks. There is a slight soapy, slick feel w/ mild spice and gentle biscuit texture as the malt evolves w/ the yeast. A tinge of sweetness with the creamy texture and tinges of alcohol warmth  T - A candy sugar taste touches the tip of the tongue and there is spice a malty mild wheat flavors w/ dark cereal essence. The taste is light with the spice perhaps a result of the wheat w/ nice mild caramel and delicious raisin w/ slight custard notes. There is gentle toasted malt flavor and a delicious touch of alcohol adding complexity to the ale as it goes down. The dark malt flavor isn't overwhelming in fact it gets drier as it warms. The crisp, yet intense flavor is full and complex.  D - An excellent dark strong ale from Unibroue- one of my faves. Breathtakingly easy to drink - a bit too easy ; ) This 8% is ""uncommonly smooth"" as the bottle mentions. Don't pass this 'damned' beer up!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,WillClark,4.32,"Poured out of the 750ml bottle into a wide wine glass a murky redddish brown with a decent head that released some rich, yeasty fruit notes that conjure images of black cherries and plums. The taste is round and sweet with a pretty big mouthfeel without being overbearing in any way. The finish is nice and smooth with a gentle sweetness and slight dryness to clean off the palate.  This is a well disguised 8% beauty from the Unibroue folks. I really can't tire of the ale in any way, shape or form. Subtly complex and rewarding.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,chinabeergeek,3.95,"750ml with best before date of 10-15-10  translucent copper brown w red-orange tint. a much lighter colored than i expected. decent head gradually fades to thin layer. some lacing.  whiffs of fruity pear, spice and brown sugar, with hint of non-hop citrus.  flavor is spice, but almost like diluted clove and nutmeg. nutty, grainy, plus caramel. brown sugar again. gentle bitterness goes into finish, which is herbal and again nutty.  thinner than hoped, but smooth. very carbonated but not completely overpowering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,hustlesworth,4.77,"750ml crowned and corked, nearly a year old.  A- nicely colored deep foggy rusty/mahogany/ochre with a tight bubbled foamy buff colored head. sheer curtains of lace are draped along the glass but slide down in time leaving ridges and fingers and curls. and for the record, after the foam settles to about 1/2in i can clearly see the duvel 'D' from the etchings in my tulip.  S- very unique fruity and extremely floral aroma, perfume like, of lilies and apple blossoms and wildflowers, orange curacao, pineapple, banana peel, tart citrus undertones, fermenting berries, allspice and clove, green apples, vanilla ice cream, and pears sauteed in butter and brandy and some herbal hops as well as an underlying meaty savory character that totally complements the more powerful fruity floral aromas. alcohol is well hidden (until it warms) and as it warms toasty malt, leather, and applewood provide a nice grainy woodsy layer to this amazingly complex nose.  T- sweet, toasted, and nutty with a hint of yeast spiciness, namely in the form of clove, nutmeg, white peppercorn, and allspice. i expected more of a fruity tartness so i'm gonna let this one warm up for a few minutes. ok that helped a little, the sweetness has been cut by just a few minutes of holding it snifter-like in my cupped hands. fruit is still subdued, but more apple, pear, banana, and pineapple, red grapes, and a melange of other orchard fruits hang softly backstage. malt doesn't seem to come to play until the finish, where its pale and toasty barley and cereal flavors provide a lip smacking crispness with tart underlying citrus that might be from the hops. if not, they hardly make an appearance save for a grassy 'green' taste at the end. i don't really need any bitterness in an already spectacular brew, but i still feel something is missing.  MF- like crushed velvet on the tongue with a minty cooling effect. almost cloying if under proper temperature, be sure to serve this one around 50'. at the right temp though, it leaves a very fresh fruity and floral aftertaste with clean dry grains and the essence of brightly colored nature. i feel like girls would wanna make out with me after i take a drink of this. is that weird? very tight medium low carbonation feels almost nitro smooth and properly breaks the silence of the sheer juiciness of this ale.  D- O, how i could drink this day and night. i bet i could even drink it out of a bottle (dodges arrows and throwing axes). to be blessed with another divine offering from unibroue, my soul is far from maudite.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BDIMike,4.29,"Pours a nice deep amber color, with an inch thick white head with great retention. Unfermented and cloudy with heavy carbonation. Smell is incredible. A big sugar smell is predominant accompanied by nice dark malts. Also a good plum smell along with other dark fruits. The taste starts with immediate dark fruits: plum and raisin. A good bit of alcohol and spice also help to balance perfectly with the fruit flavors. Mouthfeel is very light and crisp. There is a nice thickness to it as well, that makes it incredibly smooth. Drinkable beer for a strong ABV. Nice balance all the way around makes this a great beer. With the amount of flavor, it still has a nice drinkability, making this an excellent selection.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,cvstrickland,4.32,"750 ml cork-in-cage bottle with devilishly-sinister label-art of a ghostly boarding party paddling a canoe across a hellish sky as a smug-looking Satan-type character grins from underneath. Yeah, it's a little creepy, but the bottle opens with a healthy pop! , and when poured into a tulip, the unholy-looking vessel yields a dark, mysterious amber body crowned with a thick finger of soapy off-white foam that reduces quickly to a sheet, leaving the barest speckles of lacing.  Smell is enticing, with bubblegum laced with clove and the sweet yeasty heft of cinnamon rolls. Citrus notes of zippy lemon and savory lime are joined by a sweet floral note as the drink warms, spicing up the warm bready malt tone that forms the backbone of the aroma and the flavor. Earthy notes of damp black soil and dry hay contribute to the party.  Taste is rich and fruity with mellow yeasty notes, a tingle of fresh sliced plums sprinkled with tart dry lemonade powder, mixed in a mouthful of dry and bready, malty syrup. Earthy and nutty tones show in the aftertaste, as does a perfume of gardenias and white grape juice, laced with soft banana and ripe, fragrant plum. The drink has a growing toasty presence as it warms, solidifying the malt dominance and giving the aromatics a bigger, better-leveled playing field to strut their stuff on, and the final cloudy pour from the bottle boosts the banana flavor and brings a slightly powdery note. Wow.  I bought this beer after reading an amusing thread on the Forum entitled something like, ""Maudite-holy crap!"" that bumped around for a while. The OP expressed his blown-awayness at the Unibroue offering, and asked others for accounts of similar experiences. Well, then, friends, I didn't post on that thread, but I'll post it here... Maudite is, indeed, a ""Holy Crap!"" beer experience.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Such a big fan of La Fin Du Monde I had to give Unibroue more business.  A: Poured cloudy deep amber, one finger dirty eggs head moving to thick base and spots of lacing.  S: Dry at first yeasty, followed by possibly bananas and dashes of cloves/black pepper come.  T: Follows the nose, then into smooth malt comes out, with peppery finish.  M: Medium to heavy but light bubbles  D: Quite good. My boss is from Ottowa and I am continually impressed with the chaps at Uibroue..while not as good as other brews, this still is a fine example of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Natural510,3.97,"12oz bottle, best-by dated 3/14/10  Pours a light amber color with little head or lacing, which was a bit disappointing. Smells of yeast and high fruit. I'm getting green apples, plum and tangerine, among others. Yeast is apparent in first sips as well, backed by a creeping maltiness and subtle dry hoppiness. There is a definite spiciness of clove and pepper; tangerine & cherries mixed with dried fruit such as raisins & dates add to the sweetness along with an overall brown sugar flavor. Mouth feel is quite dry & puckering from the fruit & yeast. While there was no head to speak of, it did remain carbonated with each sip.  Overall a good, but not great, attempt at a Belgian strong ale. After my wonderful experience with Unibroue's triple, I suppose I expected a bit more punch in flavor from this offering. However, it is still nicely balanced and provides and easy-drinking 8%ABV ale without the heavy syrupiness from others of this variety.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MiScusi,4.15,"On tap at the Back Abbey in Claremont, CA. Pours a fairly dark brown with a light tan head into a Unibroue Maudite Glass. The head is pretty substantial and sticks around a while. The smell is pretty standard for a belgian dark ale, with grapes or prunes noticable. Everything else was pretty good, it was a good beer that was pretty tasty, and fairly fruity.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Strix,4.55,"Pours a cloudy brown with a head that pretty much dissipates.  Smell is sweet and fruity. All the fruit flies that had been lurking in my kitchen around a bunch of bananas came over to investigate. I pick up bubblegum on top of a mix of ripe fruits.  Wow, this is interesting. A lot going on. Orange, toffee, cherries, pear, clove, pepper, bananas, other spices, and a slight note of hops, with alcohol present. I like it.  Mouthfeel smooth, with a bite of carbonation at the end and a presence of alcohol.  A winner from Unibroue. Recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ccrida,3.13,"750ml bottle poured into my Meantime snifter, Maudite is a hazy amber/copper color tons of streamers forming an off-white head with medium-large sized bubbles that leave lightly scattered, foamy lace. An interesting, lighter colored BSDA, but could use more last and lacing.  Smell is moderate, very sweet and sugary, lots of fruity esters. Pretty good, but lacking depth.  Taste fairly muted, not as sweet as the aroma, the fruit here is more cured, from grapes on the nose to raisins on the tongue. Frankly, I expected more. There is a difference between smooth and bland, and this just doesn't pack enough flavor for my taste, even though there are no off-flavors or flaws. It's just not too exciting. As it warms, some plasticy phenols come to the fore, and it starts to get a bit rough. While they're within range of the style, the lack of flavor otherwise over-emphasizes them.  Mouthfeel is very spritzy, way too much for my taste, it mutes the flavors. Lighter body for the size.  Drinkability is pretty good, in that it has a bland, seltzer water taste that beguiles it's ABV, although it's too gassy to drink with speed, and to boring to want another bottle. Based on the high rating, I found it to be a let down, as I feel about all of their beers I've had save La Fin du Monde, which is excellent. In the end, this was pretty generic. This was cheap enough, and I had enough stuff to do this evening, that I didn't even bother with the second half of the bottle. Not that it tasted bad enough for a drainpour, but more that I'm at the point where I save my body for the beers I really enjoy (or spent to much dough on). This one was neither.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S: smell is very intense with the aroma of dark ripe sweet fruits (berries, fig, dates, banana). hefty malting mixed with a nice yeast profile. Also to note, smelling the inside of the empty bottle is amazing. it smells like sweet berry pie...that sounds weird i know, but it does!  T: WOW! This is fantastic! It's like a puzzle and all the empty pieces are what make up my taste buds and when I pour this into my mouth all the pieces are where they need to be! The dominant flavor on my palette is that of really sweet dark fruits, somewhat berry-like complimented perfectly by the toffee, caramel malt flavors and assortment of spices. VERY well balanced with a minute amount of hops. Almost unnoticeable alcoholic presence but has a slightly warming effect as it goes down and lingers in your mouth. There is so much going on in this beer I could spend ages analyzing it!  M: very well balanced beer, almost creamy smooth. my mouth wants more!  D: well balanced, amazingly delicious and completely unnoticeable ABV make this beer ultimately re-drinkable. this could be a session dark ale!  The taste is like nothing I've had before in a dark ale. Amazingly complex and flavorful. This is the best Belgian Dark I've had. Period. And it's from my home province!

There were loads of yeast particulates evident in suspension - ale on lees indeed! The huge effervescence of this brew caused a big 2+ inch tan head to form with a gentle pour. That head dropped to 1/4 inch in about 10 minutes, leaving only slight lacing down the glass.  S= The aromas coming off this ale were dominated by sweet malts, spice, and alcohol. There were also hints of awesome Belgian yeasts - fruity and estery.  T= The complexity of flavors in this ale was incredible. At various times I tasted herb spiciness, tartness, and fruitiness. The malts lended bready qualities and the warming alcohol finish left me wanting more.  MF= That famously high Unibroue carbonation level lent this beer a crisp feel, despite its medium body.  D= This was one incredibly flavorful Belgian style ale. Way back in the day, this was the first ever Unibroue beer that I tried, and it is still one of my favorites.

The body is a dark auburn color, slightly hazy. There's a gentle fragrance that is clove-y and yeasty, with a farm-fresh quality that intensifies as it warms and is swirled. Almost minty.  There's a lot to like out of the first sip; abundant caramel and specialty malt flavor balanced well with the Belgian yeast, and a light, wet, yet highly carbonated almost soda-like mouthfeel that seems to provide exceptional drinkability. Finishes spicy but still not dry. This beer provides a jolt to all senses.  If I could change anything, it might be sacrificing some drinkability for more depth in the body. If I'm paying $2.50 a bottle I'm probably not going to be pounding these all night, so it could sit a little heavier. Still, that's a minor complaint.

Yet another way that this beer reminds me of white wine.  mouthfeel: tons of carbonation, not to full and not too light in body, plenty of alcohol on the finish but in an awesome way.  drinkability: delicious, smooth, refreshing, interesting.

S - A big yeasty character in the nose. Malts are detectable as well. Very strong aromas.  T&M - Tastes as I would expect from the scent: the yeasty flavor blends great with the malts. The flavor really grew on me as I drank it. A fair amount of carbonation that I feel goes really well with the flavor profile, making for a nice mouthfeel.  D - The alcohol content really grew on me during this one, which diminishes the drink a tad. But like I said, the flavor really grew on me, and I definitely enjoyed the beer.

A: Hazed apple butter like color, very deep, dark browns and reds. Lots of active carbonation and a careful pour resulted in veryfew yeast particles. Light tan, off white head that hangs around forever but lace is not very retentive. S: Spicy, malty sweet aroma. Lots of dark fruit flavors, sugar, cloves, and light alcohol in the background. T: One of my favorite Unibroue beers, amazing punch of complex flavors. Fruity sweet body up front with a malt background, followed by yeast middle and slightly spicey, peppery finish. Slight hop bitterness balance out the sweet and finishes slightly slick biscuity with some warming alcohol, but no strong alcohol flavor.

Taste: Wheat, perhaps something akin to a faint peanut brittle...I can't resist simply calling it, ""ambrosia.""  Palate: spritzy and quenching. As the Unibroue people describe it themselves, a cognac-like finish.  Overall: What a brew! This one is great all by itself.

Typical belgian yeastyness. A touch of clove and nutmeg spice.  Mouthfeel: Typical fizzyness of a Belgian... probably too fizzy for me.

So far so good. Aromas of crisp wheat grain malts with a touch of caramel. Big spicy aromas swirl about with some mixed fruity aspects lurking in there as well.  First sip brings a crisp wheat malt upfront with a hint of caramel sweetness. This moves into a sturdy spicy flavor profile with hints of clove and earthy yeast accents. Fruity, citrusy flavors move in and out along the way down. Finishes with a touch of bitterness and a spicy, yeasty afterthought. Tasty brew.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly effervescent. It races across the palate with a fast moving tingle. Overall, an enjoyable brew with that trademark Unibroue yeast flavor. Damn drinkable and priced right for when I want a tasty Belgian style brew. One of my faves from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jenbys2001,4.97,"I love everything about this beer - the taste, the appearance, the macabre label. Unibroue does everything right with this brew. It pours an impenetrable dark brown color that takes on an almost plum color in the glass. There is a slight head which evaporates quickly leaving a bit of lacy head retention. The nose is very fruity, with pear and apple notes as well as a peppery spiciness. The taste reflects the excellence I have generally come to expect from Unibroue. It has a complex but perfectly balanced flavor that contains fruit notes, bread maltiness and hints of clove and nutmeg. The finish is fruity, with a slight hint of wood. This is a fine example of a traditional Belgian Ale and a really satisfying beer. In spite of the high ABV, I could see myself drinking this as a session beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Georgiabeer,4.2,"Pours a hazy chestnut brown with a nice head that fades to a thin cap in relatively short order. No lacing. Typical aromas of Belgian yeast with a bit of spice, some coriander, and pepper as well as a nice breadiness. Quite carbonated, and thge taste is a little thinner and spicier than I'd like. A bit more breadiness and even a bit more sweetness would be welcome. Quite spicy with pepper, more coriander, and orange peel. Quite herbal and very drying on the finish. Enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,fitzy84,3.93,"On tap at the Moan and Dove. Pretty dark appearance with some amber seen in the light. Medium size, thick head that stays for awhile. Eventual lacing. Quasi-smoked flavors of hops were fascinatingly permeating from this drink, giving it an almost woody taste. On actual taste, the almost grape-like, fruity bitterness was relaxingly enjoyable. Medium body but with a slightly annoying low carbonation to an almost perfect ale. Overall, a great belgian.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bloberglawp,4.15,"Pours a deep cooperish brown, nice foammy white head that sticks around and laces nicely.  Aroma of belgian yeast spice and dried fruit, a pleasant spiced dubbel would fit.  Flavor is unibroue yeast, faint presence of wheat malt and a nice blend of spice. Delicious!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheManiacalOne,4.07,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.  A: The beer is a medium brown color, with a large and dense off-white head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of Belgian yeast, spice, caramelized malts and dark fruits with a touch of hops.  T: The taste starts with flavors of caramel, spice and some fruit, but they all seem a bit overshadowed by the Belgian yeast flavor. However, there's still a decent balance. The malt character is hearty and there's a mild hops presence. The after-taste is slightly sweet.  M: Smooth and a little crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is dry and slightly sticky.  D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a decent beer overall even if it might not be first one that I would pick, but it's still worth drinking for a while.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Wetpaperbag,4.35,This is one of my more choice drinks when I want a Belgian style beer. The bottle label was very intriguing and definitely sucked me in. I think of cinnamon when I'm drinking this beer. There is a nice little spice with this beer. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,RixBeer,3.97,Pours orange-amber with a quarter inch of head. Head subsides but not too much.  Smell of fruit and thank weird funk that unibroue beers have. I wonder if it's the water. Yup I'd have to see it's the H20 that makes that smell.  Sweet maple wood with a zesty kick. Pretty good like most Unibroue beers.  That orangey liquor flavor isn't bad even though it doesn't hide the alcohol enough. The carbonation however is lively to the point where combined with the flavor is a bit much and makes this feel like too much.  Like usual I can have one of these at a time. Unibroue beers are great in moderation [as in 1].  Overall a really good beer!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TasteTester,3.78,"A-Golden amber, deep color. Nice head. Can see sediment in suspension.  S-Sweet, citrus and fragrant. Some hint of bitter malts.  T-Fruity, smooth, typical of unibroue.  M-Good mouthfeel. Smooth.  D-Could have a couple, but not something I would drink on a regular basis.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,shabbtastic,3.82,"A - Poured a ruby red to brown into a tulip. Small head that didn't fade at all, very impressive.  S - Sweet and fruity with hints of dark cherry and raisin. Spicy yeast is noticeable more in the background.  T - A lot going on here, roasted bready malts are followed by sweet fruits. Earthly hops along with the Belgian spicy yeast.  M - Medium / full bodied, a little on the thick and syrupy side. Definitely a sipper.  D - I originally served this straight out of the fridge, too cold. Got better as it warmed [I should have known]. I wouldn't drink more than one of these but would definitely enjoy again, recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,HugoGrim,4.08,"Poured from the bottle into a chalice. Dark peach/brown body. Tons of visible carbonation. Thick head.  Aroma of ripe fruits and bitter apples, as well as some fig. Spicy.  Tart fruits balanced with a heavy spice profile. Black pepper, fig, malts, clove, apple.  Yet another excellent Belgian ale offering from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ClashmoreMike,3.99,"From a bottle dated ""best before 08-14-10."" Poured into a Riedel Vinum burgundy glass (best thing I had).  A =Beautiful dark apple-cider/dark caramel color. Cloudy. Huge head that sticks around for a while and eventually goes down to a nice, thin layer that stays for the duration.  S =Clove. Some tart fruity smell. Earthy and a tiny bit pungent. Smells a bit like a champagne.  T = Peppery spiciness. Cloves and apples. Yeasty. Mild, balancing bitterness in the finish. A slight candy sweetness joins the fun as the beer warms up. Some citrusy acidity.  M =Nice carbonation. Becomes very smooth as it warms up. Mouthfeel is very similar to champagne, just with more body.  D =Very easy to drink, especially once you let the beer warm up some. It's a good, complex beer. Kind of a beer-champagne hybrid. Definitely a beer that gets better, and grows on you, as it warms up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,joezak5,4.45,"Appearance: Poured into a Duvel sniffter; clean and clear ruby with huge tannish white head, good retention and really nice lacing when enjoyed. I poured the yeasty portion into a separate glass; dirty thick muddy brown with little head.  Smell: Larger portion has a thick bready malt with a little cinnamon spice in the background. The yeasty portion is an almost pure earthy yeast.  Mouthfeel: Huge chewy feel with champagne like carbonation, just a little tingly spice on the tongue. Yeasty portion is is a thick gritty concoction with subdued carbonation.  Taste: Crisp cinnamon bread with citrus notes at the finish. The yeasty portion is an earthy and dusty caramel yeast fest. The differences are amazing.  Drinkability: Near perfect crispiness and maltiness, balanced yet complex.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,DIM,3.8,"a: This was a clear copper color with golden highlights. It pours with a massive fizzy off-white head that fades very quickly leaving tons of lace in it's wake.  s: Aromas of floral apples dominate. Musty grains, sweet simple syrup, and a bit of alcohol come along as well.  t: Big sour apple flavors with some cherry notes hit first. Next is some prickly pepper on the tip of the tongue. The finish is dry and floral. This is milder than most Unibroue offerings, making it a bit more approachable.  m: The carboantion was fizzy and faded too quickly.  d: This was a fine offering from Unibroue, but I prefer some of their others.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,biggmike,3.75,"Poured a dark caramel color with a bit of a haze and little and quick dissipating head. Aroma and Taste are both fruity. Plums and raisins perhaps. Taste is also yeasty. Mouthfeel is good, maybe a tad thinner than expected. I was somewhat disappointed in this one, expected more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Hujak22,4.85,"A: A mid brown color, slight red tints. Fairly cloudy. Looks inviting, lightly carbonated. One inch head that disappates quickly. Light lacing down half the bottle before lacing stops.  S: Very clean smell, slightly flowery. Light in smell, yet feels slightly heavy.  T: Initial flavor is slightly nutty, malty during the stay in mouth, leaving a fizzy, fruity aftertaste that is slightly pear flavored. Has a clean finish.  M: Quite chewy, light and smooth. Good feel on the tongue.  D: Very drinkable, definately would have this at any opportunity. Extremely enjoyable.  Poured from a bottle into Becker glass.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,nocheinsbitte,4,"Just had this bier in a bottle at home while relaxing. A: Good looking bier as it was poured, redish in color, medium carbonation, a huge, thick head that stayed for a long, long time. Good look. Smell: Sweet in smell. Pears and grapes noted. Taste: Smooth tasting bier, a pleasure to have. Mouthfeel: Not quite as rich and full as I expected, but still good. Drinkability: a good bier to have 1-2 during an evening; maybe 3-4 on weekend dur to the high alcohol content. A good bier, not my favorite, but I will give this a good rating.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,LumpyGuitar,4.2,"This beer poured a deep reddish brown. Had alot of head, pretty thick, and left a solid lacing.  Smelled alot like yeast, pepper, maybe some lemon.  Taste started wet and sweet and finished dry and a bit rough. Alot of flavor here, very fruity, spicy, flavors I can't yet identify. Finish is pretty bitter. Very complex.  Mouthfeel was very heavy and dry, quite a bit of carbonation here but in a good way, it provides a balance to this beer that makes it unique.  Drinkability is good for me, but not great. I'll definately get a few more of these but I can't drink it as a session beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,YankChef,4.72,"12 oz. foil wrapped bottle poured into a chimay chalice.  Apperance: deep dark amber wiith hints of peach and reddish hues. Fluffy white head that creates nice lacing and sticks to the top of the beer and does not dissipate.  Smell: spicy and very, very yeasty due to the bottle fermentation. Hints of apple, cinnamon, some pepper and a little cherry.  Taste: Upfront there a pronounced juicy sweetness that has bold red delicious apple flavor as well as other fruit such as pear and peach. There is a somewhat mild hop prescence in the middle that is clearly just a balancing aspect of the beer, this beer is not showcasing hops it is showcasing balance. There is certainly a bitterness however that is akin to a medium tannic red wine. There is certainly a certain astringency left and this beer does dry your palatte out. but its coo  Overall: This is one of those beers that should almost be its own category because it stands alone as a unique and incredibly delicious beer. Props to Unibroue for creating this masterpiece of modern brewing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,montageman,4.62,"Poured into a tulip.  I've had good experiences with Unibroue beers and this one is no different. In fact, this may be the best offering of theirs I've had. Rich deep amber in color with a substantial tan head that leaves a ton of lacing. The aroma is totally complex - orange, clove, coriander, cinnamon, and other dried fruit. The taste is fruity, sweet, and really balanced. Mouthfeel is nearly perfect and mellows as the beer warms. At 8%, this is dangerously drinkable. Very tasty - a top quality brew. Highest recommendation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Maudite,4.15,"My bias is that it's my namesake...Had this one at Albatross Pub in Berkeley, CA last night.  A- Rich, malty brown, almost the color of the bar-top. If carrot cake were a beer color, this was it. Poured an off-white head about 1 finger with minimal yet sticky lacing. The head gradually dissipated into a tiny halo that left it's ring all the way down the glass. Small amount of yeast particles floating throughout, gathered on the bottom of the glass.  S- Big nose...burnt wood (whiskey-like), toffee, carmel, apple/pear. Very fruit-cake like aromas...Malty, sweet, spicy, woody...Very aromatic and rich...almost a cognac aroma blended with cloves and nag champa incense. Wonderful nose.  T- Rich, malty, sweet. Big yeast kick. Alcohol is present towards the finish with a slight bite on the tip of the tongue, but not very phenolic in the body. The fruit cakiness is in the taste as well, rich, delicate fruits, caramel, spices...Rum raisin? Carrot cake? Somewhere around there with a nice balance and subtle oakiness.  M- Not quite as acidic or champagney as it appears, but definitely bubbly and biting in the mouth. As I said above, the alcohol content is slightly deceptive as it is only noticed towards the end of drinks, and then just a nip on the tip of the tongue.  D- This devil sneaks up on you. A great beer to drink almost anytime, but I always find it most enjoyable at a very wooden pub early in the night...gets the tongue loose and conversations flowing. Save your second one for closing time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dill,4.35,on draught in a Maudite snifter a - amber color with light carbonation s - smells of orange and grapefruit with a bit of yeast t - taste is a bit spicy with the fruity aromas still present. a mild amount of hops. a really nicely balanced beer. m - very crisp. d - This is a great beer that is easy to drink. It was gone before I knew it.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,GRPunk,4.82,"Bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A- It poured with a huge (3 finger) off-white head atop a deep chestnut brown beer. There were also small brown drops of sediment in the head and full streams of carbonation rising to the top. Fluffy rings stuck to the glass throughout the bottle.  S- The aroma was a complex play between sweet fruit and roasty grains. On second sniff, I picked up the sourness that hit me right from the first sip.  T- More complexity in the flavor. There were definite sour notes to accompany fruity tones and less forward sweet malts. As the beer warmed, I found more alcohol notes that warmed the belly.  M- The was quite full. There was a foamy feel from the head along with some grainy notes and medium carbonation. The sour flavor had a drying effect on the finish.  D- The drinkability is great. It's a definite sipper, but I'd come back to this beer again.  Overall- Unibroue makes some great beers and right now it would be hard for me to say this isn't their best. Everything about this beer is complex. Throughout I would find new flavors, aromas, and textures. I would recommend this beer to somebody that likes a slighty dry champagne/sparkling wine. There is a lot that reminds me of the flavor and feel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,RobH,4.29,"I bought a bottle of this beer after having had a 2oz. taste of it at a beer fest a couple of weeks prior.  The appearance and smell were exactly as the Bros. describe it in their reviews...very inviting and interesting.  This is no ""ordinary"" beer, for sure. Not quite, but almost over the top in some ways in terms of drinkability. I scored it ""good"", but I did find that as I neared the bottom of the glass it was becoming harder to get down. I decided when I was done that I wanted another beer, but just not this one.  I may be in the minority on my experience, yet either way I still recommend this beer and I think everyone should try it. In fact, I would have another one again sometime. I just know that it will probably be the only one of these for the evening.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Becomes slightly more fruity and creamy when held on the tongue. Some floral notes linger after also  M- Its light yet creamy, medium carbonation. a little watery.  D- Was expecting more in the flavour department. Alcohol is well hidden but there is a lack in complexity for me. Still drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,morimech,4.12,"Pours a slightly opague very dark gold or amber. A two-fingered head forms that slowly settles to a thick cap. Some sticky lacing is left on the glass surface during consumption.  The smell is full of spice, dark fruit, and other rum like characteristics. No hints of alcohol.  The taste is likewise full of spice and dark fruit flavors. True to stlye but a bit unremarkable. There is no hint of alcohol and it has a little semi-sweet finish. Maudite has a medium body with good carbonation. The ABV is too high for me to enjoy regularly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Nice 1in head that suck around for a decent time, a little foam lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell was powerful, nice and spicy with a bit of sweet, very complex.  Taste and mouthfeel were phenomenal, this stuff is good. The alcohol is fairly apparent, but it is 8% after all and was still really smooth.  As usual with me and good Belgian ales, I could drink this stuff all day.  This is a damn good beer. I didn't know people in Canadia made stuff as good as this, now I must visit Quebec. I love this stuff",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Pours a murky brown. Has a wonderfully yeasty and wheaty aroma. The initial taste is strong, yeasty with a touch of sweetness. It goes down the throat beautifully, with a full wheaty aftertase. I've always felt this beer to be a weizenbock. I really should do a blind taste test with this one and Aventinus and pick my favourite..",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,JohnGalt1,3.94,"750 picked up at the Coop sometime last week for about $7.. shared with Brenda.. mine poured into my New Belgium snifter.  Fizzy 2"" head... drops quick and leaves only spotty lacing... hazy copper amber brew.  Very bready with just pretty strong whiffs of Belgian esters.. I think this is one of Unibroue's brews that has a ""house"" aroma... light spice and fruity qualites.. but somehow seems a little light for the style.  Light caramel and green apples.. better than the aroma.. toasty notes play well with the yeasty spiciness. Sorta has some cardamom spice..but I could easily be wrong. Very carbonated but the bubbles are little and everpresent. Not burpy. Earthy hops.. but hard for me to pick out among the yeasty esters.  I've had Maudite probably a couple dozen times of over the years.. it seems to be that beer that somehow I can still justify picking up when I already spent the budget on other micros. Pretty good, but there are better.. just maybe not in the same price range.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A familiar Belgian feel with some yeastiness, spices, and then a light maltiness.  Taste is good. Again, has a familiar Belgian feel. A light fruitiness with some spice. Also sweet malt character and a minor bitterness seems more apparent as it warms.  Mouthfeel is thin with a sharp carbonation tingle.  Drinkability is fair.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

This is starting to sound like a Dr Seuss book.  Smell was sweet, with fruits and caramel. Had a bit of a grainy aroma as well. It was like a caramel apple sandwich, which probably sounds terrible, but conventional wisdom gets thrown out with beer.  Flavor hits first with the nutty caramel, then crisp fruits like apples. There's a spicy flavor floating around as well. This brew is full of flavor. They all work very well together, but it's a little too sweet at times.  Mouthfeel was great. Smooth, creamy, and fairly crisp. It does leave a somewhat thick feeling aftertaste, but it's not bad.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The Maudite poured into my tasting snifter a deep mahogany with a foamy vanilla head. The aroma was fruity with hints of dates and figs. The taste was spicy and sweet with a champagne-like finish, probably due to the yeast used. There is a bitterness quality to Maudite but not overpowering. It almost reminds me of a ""light"" Barleywine. It has the same aroma and flavor characteristics, but isn't as dark or deep. Maudite is definitely worth your time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,albern,4.63,"Wow, what a surprise. I've had the other Unibroue beers and I bought this to round out the experience. I didn't realize this was a Belgian, and what a fine Belgian it is. The beer pours a nice brown, tawny color with a nice thick, creamy, off white head that retains and laces. The smell is candied sugar malts, some spices, typical Belgian yeasty aromas, only not excessively. The smell is the low point, and at a 4, it isn't that low. The beer is a full bodied, slightly syrupy, thick, and very complex Belgian. The taste is just wonderful. You get the full gamut of candied sugar malts, Belgian yeastiness, a slight fizzy snap, lots of apple, coriander, clove, and maybe a touch of dark fruits all nicely settled in. What makes this just an exceptional beer is that you'll get none of the heavy ABV throatyness found in so many other other thick syrupy Belgians. This one does an incredible job masking it all over. The 8% ABV comes through ever so slightly on the very tail end, but that's all. In addition, you can expect some caramel malts, some peppery bite, some citrusy tang, and God knows whatever else. The style is great and this beer is about as good a representation of the style as you'll find. This one is well worth seeking out. L'Chaim.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Douglas14,4.2,"Slowly and carefully poured to reveal a rich, complex burnt orange/ brownish color with mild transparency. It has a nice slightly off-white head that leaves good lacing and keeps a thin layer above the beer. The smell is of fruit, malt, and various spices: cinnamon, cloves and pepper even. The taste mirrors the aroma but displays even greater depth and complexity. As the beer warms up, it becomes a bit spicier (originally poured at 52 faren.). It has a full body with a slightly dry finish to it. Great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

There so much going on with the taste, but the flavors are all very subtle -- fruity, citrusy, with the finish of the spiciness from the aroma and a hint of hop bitterness. Best to let this sit a bit after opening to take the edge of the carbonation. This was very impressive, tasty and dangerously easy to drink at 8 % ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

S: Spices and a bit of an apple peel aroma. Alcohol cuts through the mix a little in the end.  T: Spiced apple (again, more the applepeel taste than the fruit itself) and clove. Malts, a dash of peppery tastes, and alcohol that makes for a warm finish. Becomes a little more tart as it warms in the goblet. A fair bit going on, and it all needs to be sorted sip after sip.  M: Something of a forceful feel, like it takes hold of the tongue immediately, scours it for missing nooks between tastebuds to fill - then magically shimmers away in a sparkle. Very crisp, with the lingering warmth on the finish to remind you it was there.  D: So easy to drink, but enough to make sure you feel it.

22,33,fank2788,4.2,"12oz bottle best before 4/10 served in a tulip This beer is a slightly murky dark amber brown, almost beer bottle brown, with a thick sticky white head. The smell is pretty bready and malty a bit of spice and a fair bit of yeasty easter. The taste is full bready malt, mainly in the caramel range then fruit probably apples. Next is a bit of alcohol spice somewhat heavy in phenols, cloves etc from the yeast, this beer seems to finish with a touch of vanilla. The mouthfeel is very prickly and peppery the finish is pretty clean and dry with a touch of a stinging bite. Overall this is good, subtle but assertive, complex but not overly challenging, another good Unibroue beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Dukeofearl,4.18,"4-pack of 11.2 ounce bottles from La Bodega in Riverside, CA. for $14.99, purchased January 2008.  Pours a clear brown with ruby higlights in my Piraat chalice, a very nice foamy white head sticks around a while.  Aromas of raisins and other dark fruit, and a moderate spiciness. Flavor continues the trend, but with a set of spices. One spice is very distinct (is it clove?), and is a bit strong for my liking. A bit of pepper, but not strong. Overall, this is a pleasant roasty dark ale, well worth enjoying. Alcohol is very well hidden, only a bit of heat, as is typcial of the Unibroue line of treats.  Mouthfeel is very pleasant- creamy, even though there isn't a lof of visible carbonation.  A winner.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,nanchen,4.32,"Excellent and unique beer. It was copper orange under the light and definitely hazy. You can't see through it.  The smell had spicy aromatics, peppers and coriander.  Taste was deep fruits and citrus, well balanced by hops and bitterness. With a nice sweet lingering aftertaste.  Mouthfeel was smooth and slightly thick.  Definitely drinkable, though the complexity and the sheer amount of flavor may be a little much. I wouldn't make this a session beer, more like a beer I drink when I want to blow my mind with flavor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,DoubleJ,4.09,"The bottled version has a more intense peppery feel to it than the tap version. I didn't realize the beer was lighter in color until I shined a light through it (kind of a purple-orange mixture). I wasn't as impressed with the bottled version because it was a little more hot than what I remembered. The head is also a little lackluster as well, numbing some of the flavor in the beer when it collapses.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Gehrig,4.76,"The more I drink selections from Unibroue, the more impressed I am with their wares. Maudite is really outstanding. The appearance is wonderful, with two fingers of white foam capping a caramel body with red highlights--truly exceptional. The smell is good, with plenty of the famous yeast Unibroue uses coming forward with fruit and peppery spices. The taste is incredible, in good part because of the magnificent mouthfeel. There's lots more fruit to the taste than accompanies the nose. Plenty of spice in this as well--pepper for sure, but I detect ginger and cinnamon also.  The mouthfeel makes Maudite go. It's ideally carbonated and very smooth, nudging the flavors forward and keeping them in balance. Maudite is yet another gift from Unibroue, easily my favorite Canadian brewery. Everything I've had from Unibroue is nothing short of great, and Maudite is no exception. I have a couple more in the fridge, and I'm fighting my desire to have the others. Either way, I win.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Kendo,4.15,"A: Poured into a Duvel oversized tulip. Body is brownish-orange with an active, rocky, 2-finger white head. Active carbonation rises throughout to refortify. No lacing, however.  S: Bready yeast, spice and fruit -- can't quite place my finger on the fruit scent, I finally come up with under-ripe plums.  T: Fruit at first -- ripe green apples, some orange peel, maybe banana as well. Then finishes with spice -- cinnamon & nutmeg, with a hint of cloves -- and dry. Alcohol warms the belly, but is otherwise hidden in the taste.  M: Good spritzy, active carbonation helps it to finish clean in the mouth. Body is lighter than expected for the style, but that might just be the light, airy carbonation playing tricks.  D: Pretty good. I'm not big of the fruity flavors in my beer, so I wouldn't see myself having a few of these, but it certainly wasn't a chore to drink.  Re-review, 11-9-11, of a bottle with ""best by"" date of August 2012.  I stand by my initial scoring, though I've bumped up what was ""Drinkability"" of 4 to an ""Overall"" of 4.5.  I also note more of an apple scent to the nose. Along with the cinnamon and spice, I'm thinking apple pie, actually. As for taste, etc. . . . I like this better than I did nearly 4 years ago when first reviewed. Getting some soda-like characteristics, and also the apple pie, both in the nose and taste.

You could smell fruit, maybe some sugar and yeast.  The taste was outstanding. The aforementioned Belgian yeast mingled well with the apples and sweets. This is a very complex flavor, but it never overextends itself.  The high carbonation gave it a strong mouthfeel. It was very tingly and allowed you to really enjoy the flavor on your palate.  Like Unibroue's La Fin du Monde, the Maudite is another outstanding beer. It's incredibly tasty and goes down easy - maybe a little too easy. Overall, an excellent beer.

Poured it into a Unibroue tulip of which I have three.  A: As soon as I began pouring the head started developing. Wow this head is out of control. The beer itself is a beautiful copper color, like an old penny, and was topped by the aforementioned thick head, at least as tall as the liquid itself.  S: Complex smell. Apples, yeast, hops. I notice some grape smell, almost like wine.  T: This beer has a lot of taste. I would equate the taste with a lot of the good Belgians. These people know what they're doing. There's a lot of those wine flavors I mentioned. Grapes and apples come through in the aftertaste. Hops are pleasant and balanced. The flavor is a little yeasty. The only place I could conceivably knock them is the sticky sweet feeling after the beer dries on my tongue.  M: Mouthfeel is pretty standard. There is a lot of carbonation from the bottle conditioning.  D: This beer is easy to drink by itself. I don't think I'd want to drink too many though because they have so much flavor. I can't really complain here though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,MMAJYK,4.1,"A- Pours a pretty milk chocolatey brown color, on the light side of brown with one finger of white head after a conservative pour. Lacing is minimal.  S- Sweet brown sugar and roasted malts. Almonds come to mind too. Also adds some sour notes of hops and fruits. Chocolatey smells are there, but not running you over.  T- Very close to nose with the brown sugar and toasty malts. Also, a little bit buttery and biscuity. Citrusy tastes of lemons that add a zing to the taste. Alcohol is WELL hidden.  M- Carbonation is high and the mouthfeel is pretty thin. Not chewy or thick at all which is misleading by the look.  D- High. Smooth taste and no alcohol really there to taste. I see myself drinking alot more of these in my future.  Overall- Great. True to style and oh so smooth.

It is full of character.  The taste has a sweetness that hides it's weight. Malty. It certainly doesn't taste like an 8% beer. Impressive.  Very drinkable. I will certainly be buying this beer again.

A fruity smell, showcasing some slight raisin, blackberry and cherries. Slight spice notes round off the aromas.  Sweet toffee, hints of orange, cherry and coriander. The taste covers the alcohol incredibly well, to the point where this beer could easily be knocked back in quick succession, which is rather dangerous. The palate finishes with some soft honey notes, and roasted malt which continues to linger afterwards, with a hint of apple.  The beer is nice and lively on the palate and easy to drink. It is a great offering from Unibroue, whom in my book, produce some star beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Maudite pours a very dark brown with a good head that thins relatively quickly. once it settles, it has a malty dark fruit taste, with high carbonation. It goes down very smooth but must be sipped slowly to truly enjoy. Tastes improve as it warms ( obviously to an extent ). A good strong ale to have after a couple bottles of true belgians to round out the night.

I detected a bit of floral overtones with spices. Not bad.  Tasted mainly of spices and a bit of an alcohol bite, not too much but just right.  Good mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation tingle that last until the last sip. Maybe slightly ""oily"" too, if that's the right term.

It was nice and crisp, but I was looking for something more creamy and rich. Good drinkability, alcohol is well balanced and hidden. Belgian beers are usually very drinkable, and this is no exception.  This is a very good Belgium style beer. The first time I tried Maudite, I thought it was great, but now I am not as impressed for some reason.

The head dissipated quickly but left a thin layer of lace on the top of the beer that stuck to the sides of the glass the whole way down.  S- Smells good, nothing to outrageous here. Lots of raisins, alcohol, and yeast.  T- chewy carmel, sherry, raisins, plenty of sweet notes with not a whole lot of hoppiness, but still balanced, its not oversweet. There are some dark malt flavors on the front and sides of the tongue too. This stuff is great, super complex, but not so subtle that its all homogeneous.  M- Some snappy carbonation, but not as much as some other Unibroue beers I've had. Silky and syrupy, but as it closes in on room temperature it thins out a bit.  D- I could drink this everyday now that the weather is cooling down. Unfortunately its high alcohol content makes that a little unrealistic ( for me at least.) I was truly impressed with this beer, its a staple in my fridge now. My only complaint, and its not much of a complaint, is that by the end of the bottle the flavor (along with your senses) is dumbed down a good deal because of the high alcohol content.

Appearance: Pours a deep dark reddish brown color, almost opaque but you can see tons of carbonation rising inside. The head formed 1-2 fingers thick and faded to one finger, retaining nicely from there.  Aroma: Raisins, plums, spices, very sweet and complex. Once you get ner the bottom you smell the yeast a lot more.  Taste: Some sweet malt it first, then it gets very complex. Ripe fruit, spices, and some yeast all combine nicely. The finish is sweet and spicy, with a slight alcohol warming in the end.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied, very crisp. The carbonation is lively and compliments the flavors nicely.  Overall: An excellent Belgian style ale. I let this one sit for two years in my makeshift cellar, upright rather than on its side, and the main difference I notice is that the yeast character present in the unibroue offerings is muted somewhat.

Spicy malty aroma that segues into a big malty flavor with just enough tartness and active carbonation to keep it from seeming heavy. The 8% ABV is well hidden, and the carbonation and spicy yeast tartness make it dangerously drinkable. All in all a very well done Belgian.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,ThatWineGuy,4.2,"Bought yesterday at the Queens Quay LCBO in Toronto, so it has to be quite fresh, I can't see an Exp date anywhere. Into a Maudite glass it goes, in bright light it's an dark apricot hue, otherwise shades of dark brown, prunes, very nectar-like in appearance. One to two finger light brown head with lots of bubbles initially, it settled to cover the surface, energetic then flattened out to a ring and some lacing that can't quite stick to the sides of the glass when swirled. Slow moving bubbles, at first quite well distributed in small groupings, later cleared.  There is a smell of yeast, dried fruit, then bananas getting ready to turn brown, sour dough or some other type of fresh bread. The taste is rye bread, marmalade rind, a sweetened ctirus presence then touches of sour add quite nicely to the mix with a pleasant lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth, flavours are big and nicley in-sych and there is a warm rye or malt whisky backdrop, all of it held together nicely considering the high alcohol content. This is a well crafted beer equally welcome before, during or after a meal, or just when you want to sit around and kick back.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

I actually said ""wow"" out loud after my first sip. Malt-leaning, but generally tasted about like it smelled. Not that much Belgian character. Smooth, sublime mouthfeel.

22,33,Romulus141,4.77,"Poured into a tall wine glass.  Appearance: Pours a hazy caramel brown with a two finger high manilla head. The head dissipates, so enjoy it while it's there. The beverage leaves light traces of lacing the edges of the glass. When held up to the light, it retains its haziness. I can see some carbonation bubbles in there. Overall, it's an intriguing beer to look at.  Smell: Fruit smell is the first thing that comes to mind when I smell this. I can detect apple mainly. There is also a floral characteristic that is quite pleasant. It reminds me a bit of potpourri. This is a quite a nice smelling beer, and it falls well within the Belgian style of beer.  Taste: Wow, there is a lot going on here. I am first greeted with an almost caramel malty sweetness, which gives way to a little bit of bitterness. This is followed up by a fruity, floral character, which is quite a transformation from the initial taste. The finish is strong, and leaves an aftertaste that only barely hits at the intense experience that this brew provides. A wonderful taste.  Mouthfeel: This is a little heavier than a typical Belgian, and less carbonated than some other varieties. Actually, this is probably the most balanced mouthfeel I have ever come across. Truly a joy to experience.  Drinkability: Man, it's hard to believe this is 8%. I could drink this all night while watching my favorite shows or listening to some great music. Each sip invites another one. I simply can't get enough.  Unibroue does it again! This is highly recommended, and I am having a hard time telling whether I like this or La Fin Du Monde better. This is darker and sweeter, while La Fin is crisper. I guess it depends on your mood. If you ever get the chance to try either, you absolutely must!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ablaze,4.32,"Hazy ruby colour, with a creamy, lasting head and decent lacing.  Quite floral and estery, like a perfume. Lots of yeast, fruits and spices.  Plenty of carbonation in a smooth, creamy medium body. Mellow alcohol lurking in the background with a robust, tasty malt base. Tart and spicy fruits with plenty of juicy Belgian flavour. Malty, grainy finish that brings it together really well. Delicious carrot cake.  This is delightful and romantic. The alcohol is pronounced and makes this a cozy evening sipper. Even though it's 8% abv, it drinks like a 10%. Regardless, it's very tasty, affordable, available...and a classic.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,PhageLab,3.78,"Large bottle stored cold, then allowed to reach room temp, unfortunately my Duvel chalice busted, so this is being served in a mug, sorry : (  A - Cloudy, yeasty dark brown than lightens up near the bottom. Obvious bits of yeast floating around. Produced a huge frothy head that hung around for a while, and the lacing was excellent.  S - Very sweet almost tart like smell, with some hints of the alcohol coming through. Near the end some spices show up, and possibly clove, but I can't be certain.  T - Yeast and malt primarily, with the sweetness coming through in the middle, like a really heavy cider. Near the end, the spices come through, and to me this balances fairly perfectly, it's obvious a lot went into this brew, and I appreciate it.  M - Thick and creamy, dries the mouth out a bit, but I suppose it helps to take another sip. Very little carbonation, suits this just fine.  D - Suffers a bit I believe, for it's sweetness. I'm not sure I could go through a second bottle. Extremely good, but one large bottle was enough for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A - Hazy deep mahogony colour poured into a snifter with a few centimetres of beige head that falls away to a thin whisp fairly quickly. S - The first thing that hits is the clove spice, followed by a rich fruitiness & backed up by some caramel toffee notes. Belgian yeast phenols are there too. T - Just like the smell, the taste is also a wonderful, complex mixture of spice, fruit and toffee. Some warming alcohol is present too. M - Lighter side of medium bodied with a medium to high carbonation with a dry finish. D - I was close to givng this a 5 but the 8%ABV held it back at 4.5. A wonderful beer that I'll be drinking time and time again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Appearance: Big creamy caramel head that settles down to a nice lace. Beer is a beautiful cloudy, rusty bronze.  Smell: Yeasty and sweet with fruit notes, a hint of nutmeg.  Taste: A rich sweet malt taste concluding with a gentle hopy sizzle on your tongue. Apple notes cloaking the pleasant presence of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Creamy but not too much so, hops and carbonation work to pleasantly keep your mouth awake. A clean sharp finish.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for a beer with 8% alcohol content, maybe a little too strong and big for a session beer, but it makes an absolutely wonderful treat for the end of a hard day or a wine-like beer to accompany a fancy meal.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Good retention and lacing.  S: Very strong citrus notes. Smells dead on the style. High alcohol phenols with very appealing yeasty esters.  T/M: Tart citrus fruits: apples, pears, cherries. Malts are nicely creamy with a bit of caramel. Light body with lifting carbonation, very clean and refreshing. Very dry finish.  D: Drinkability is pretty high.

T - Sweet, malty, caramel and toffe. Figs, plums, raisins, over-ripened fruit, (maybe even some cherries?). Slight bitterness. Earthy. Not much alcohol flavor detected in the taste, but warm in my stomach.  M - Medium to thick bodied, heavy fizzy carbonation cuts the through the thickness well. Mouthcoating.

The smell was deep oaks and wood, with bound up sweetness and caramel, the last being the true prize to be found in this beer. The taste is deep, strong, and with hints of caramel on the tail. One of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Absolutely spectacular. It's complex and full bodied, a true work of genuine craftsmanship.  The mouthfeel is rich, and full, with a slight slickness, felt about the same time the caramel comes out.

Hugely complex mix of fruitiness and alcohol.  M - Not quite creamy. Prickly carbonation seems to linger in the aftertaste along with a slight astringency. Not at all heavy.

The head faded to a thin layer of bubbles, without forming any lacing. The aroma is a great mix of dark fruit aroma, sweet candy, with a hint of alcohol. The taste is a nice sweet fruit flavor upfront, with the middle being dominated by a sweet candy sugar taste, followed by a slight alcoholic finish. Complex and delicious. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. Overall, I was very impressed with this beer. This is what I would expect from any beer labeled as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I will be throwing this into the regular rotation. Highly recommended!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,wesleyhighley,4.31,"Dark indeed. I really can only complain about the smell, which wasn't indicative of the beer itself. It had a wonderful taste and, this may seem foolish, I really like the bottle.  I tend to be a fan of darker beers (stouts and are my favorite!), but this ale really surprised me. I could drink this any day",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,SCW,4.35,"I must be honest and say I have never really taken Unibroue that seriously. It's really no slight at the company at all - I know several members of the staff rather well and they have always come across as righteous people. Yet for some reason I never bothered to really delve into their wide array of styles.  I picked up a bottle of MAUDITE on a whim. All I can say is that WHAT THE HELL HAVE I BEEN HOLDING OUT FOR?  This beer alone proves this brewery is world-class. This ale reminded me of a more robust, dynamic version of the Rochefort 10 (yes, I said Rochefort 10). Beautifully balanced, lingering honey aftertaste, best served in a goblet around 50-55.  Just a hint of yeast and spice from an Abbey yeast, but otherwise clean. Goes down way too easy...dangerously...  I've begun a foray into experimental Belgian styles over the past couple of weeks, and I can only hope to approach the level of craft and expertise I had experienced with this beer.  Cheers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Gmann,3.6,"Pours a mud puddle brown color with an average cream colored head, not much lacing detected. The smell is of corriander and orange peel, some light Belgian funk . The taste is of mellow candi sugar, corriander and orange peel, light lemon & granny smith apples, white grapes, and a bready malt base, the overall taste is quite light for a BSDA, maybe an imperial witbier?? The feel is moderate and fizzy, finishes well balanced. Quite light for a BSDA, definitely has BS pale ale characteristics Good drinkability and good Belgian brew, definitley has the Unibroue characteristics in the taste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ColoradoBobs,4.12,"Cloudy dark mahogany body under a two-finger light tan head, that reduces slowly to a solid quarter-inch lid and lasts for half an hour, leaving substantial lacing. Pretty beer.  Smell is lots of sweet dark fruits: raisins, dates, figs, dark cherries. Underneath is a solid malty-sour foundation, with a nice balance of floral hops. Hints of pepper, peach, and mint (!?). Mmmmm. Smells goood.  Taste is a bit less intense than the smell, with every note there, but a bit more sour and a bit more hops. That mint taste is there, oddly enough. Reminded me a little bit of mint snuff: a little smokey tobacco flavor.  Mouthfeel is good. Smoooth, round, full, nice light carbonation that fills everything out.  Drinkability is fine for an 8% beer.  Overall, really quite good. Definitely a good beer for the money.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

All in all, a beautiful beer.  S: A big yeasty nose that hints at honey and sugar. A quality strain lives in this bottle.  T: Big bready malts backed by a sweet yeast character that sports a flashy clove walking stick. There are slight banana notes that peek in an out as everything warms. Some alcoholic warmth, but it's not offensive.  M: Sharp on the tongue, like a good belgian should be. Bright carbonation mixed into a thinly oiled liquid.  D: Delicious. I put the 750 down and was looking for the next. So, maybe it's a bit dangerous, but damn it's good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

T: malt continues, sweet in the front, and then becomes spicy near the back of the tongue. Cherry, figs, other fruit underneath. Yeast and spice overpower just a bit, but not bad. A big beer that reaches out.  M: medium with plenty of malt backbone that lingers. Builds over time and is pleasant to sip.  D: very smooth and easy in spite of alcohol.

Lots of yeast/malt strains on the palate, along with some apple/pear/dark fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is just not impressive; thin, watery, and the flavors aren't nearly as rich or strong as other Unibroue offerings.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Cs1987,4.38,"Appearance - Dark reddish, two fingers of head which reduces quickly.  Smell - Strong smelling. The high malt content stands out in the smell, along with hints of dark fruits.  Taste - Like the smell, it is strong, and the malt stands out and tastes great. The malt is accompanied by a sweet caramel taste, and the high alcohol content isn't very evident.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, well carbonated, great aftertaste.  Drinkability - The first half of the bottle disappeared much quicker than I expected, and I would certainly have liked another one.  Overall - Very impressive. I strongly recommend Maudite to anyone who likes dark ales.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The body was initially very clear until I got around to the clouded yeasty pour. It looked reddish amber in color, and amply carbonated, forming a three finger head readily before the glass was fully filled. Aromatically, this was a mild beer, as the light spicing, nutty malt, and musky yeast smells were all quite subtle and well blended. The taste was quite dry and and rather spicy with a lot of clove and and saffron flavors. A touch of sourness and warm alcohol showed up in the finish. Very light and lively on the palette as a result of the carbonation. A little different take on the Belgian Strong Ale category, as this came somewhere between the sneaky beers like Duvel, and the very overt beers like most Quads.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,beergynt,4.83,"Becoming a BA has opened my eyes to a lot of new styles over the past couple of years and the beers of Belgium (or, rather, Belgian style beers) have really intrigued me of late...  Poured into a goblet, Maudite is truly a beautiful thing. The deep red brown color is actually a close match to the walnut desk I'm sitting at as I type this. A quickly forming light, fluffy 1"" head dies down and leaves a delicate scalloping around the perimeter of my glass... Fruits abound in the nose and I can smell a lot of banana, pineapple, and maybe a little grape. Cloves also come into play, and with the aroma of yeasty bread, the different fruity esters all come together wonderfully... All that description of smell and yet the taste is what truly makes this beer one of the most complex I've ever tasted. I get all the fruit and hints of the hop character right off the bat. While these flavors meld and then melt away, the cloves slide in riding the slightly elevated ABV, bringing a pleasant spiciness to the whole mouth. As I exhale, the heat and the spices stick around while the fruitiness, slight hoppiness and that distinct yeasty bread vibe make a triumphant return... The complexity of flavors, combined with the light tingly carbonation create a tremendously harmonic mouthfeel, helping to make this the most drinkable Belgian style beer I've had to date...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Supsended yeast is noticable. The lace was huge on the pour but died almost instantly.  Smells like yeast and alcohol. Fruity notes are also present.  Not what I was expecting. I think I got a skunked bottle because it didn't taste good at all. High in alcohol, and lots of burn. But the hops helped a little bit. Light body... I know, but I think my bottle was bad because there weren't many up on the shelf and I got mine from the back.

To me it tastes the same way it smells, I can't notice anything extra. Mouthfeel is medium with a lot of zippy carbonation. Even with the carbonation, the beer goes down very easy and smooth making this a very drinkable brew. The alcohol isn't very noticable at all either.

T: Very good, a nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale, very fruity and yeasty, with some cherries and strawberries, mixed with some dark malt.  M: Good, full-bodied, spritzy, high in carbonation, but once the carbonation dies down a bit, a rather thick brew appears, with a hint of medicinal quality.

Smells of a dark and pale hybrid.  m: Carbonation on the lower side of the high range and prickly, with a clean lighter medium body. Could stand to be a bit smoother with more body felt on the tongue.  t: Tastes good, but I really expected a bit more here, I guess in malt complexity. Still, nice clean malt sweetness with a range of spice and fruit. The spice seems to dominate, with coriander and orange peel.

Smell is of bread, yeast, and some sour notes. Taste is exceptional. I think this may be the first 5 I've given on taste but I could be wrong. Amazingly complex but somewhat easy to break down. Starts with a fruity (banana) taste, a slight taste of alcohol, and some yeast. Then it takes a complete 180 and has a great malt taste as it goes down. My very first sip it was almost hefe like but ended up like a amber. Great aftertaste, somewhat high in carbonation and that adds a nice crisp element to it.

22,33,kajerm,3.73,"750mL, sitting in my beer closet for a while, but it looks tasty to me. Pours somewhere between caramel and café-au-lait (an open request: can someone give more words for shades of brown?) with two and a half fingers of thick, substantial-looking off-white head. It leaves a great big ring of lacing with fingers of foam reaching all the way down into the beer. I can't rate this super-high, because I know this Duvel tulip makes EVERY beer look good.  The aroma is Unibroue yeast-- esters and phenols on steroids. Some sweet light esters and something that might be candi sugar; I'm not sure if Unibroue uses it.  Opens up with very subtle light malts, with massive banana esters showing up mid-palate along with some nonspecific spicy phenols. The finish is a little malty and extremely estery.  The beer is light to medium-bodied with substantial carbonation. It's a little light to be a heavy hitter with BSDAs like Rochefort out there, but it's a solid, drinkable brew-- another very workmanlike product from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Retention is great though size seems a bit small.  Nose: Very very complex here. Lots of aromas flying around, dark fruits, sweet candied aromas, and some spiciness from the hops just to name a few. Its really hard to pick out all the aromas in a brew this complex. Alcohol is well hidden.  Tongue: Complex in flavor. I detect light notes of caramel and toastiness. A lot more is going on here than just malt and hops. There are spicy flavors as well, definitely clove flavor. Not quite what I expected from this brew, there are no dark fruits...which I almost definitely expected to find. All in all, in my opinion, the flavor of this brew is fleeting.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This is the driest Belgian Strong Dark Ale that I've ever had, thats for sure. Carbonation is low as can be expected from the style and a fairly light body.

The Malty backbone is splendid but there is a wee bit of hops in here with the taste of lemon or lime zest. It's complex yet very refined. I love the Unibroue beers and Canada should hang their hat on these because it is NO DOUBT ABOUT IT...it is the best they have to offer.  M: Medium bodied. Slightly effervescent, yet very drinkable.  D: Very! I picked this one up in a 12 oz, but I have drunk many pints and 750 ml in my day. Take it any way you can get it, but enjoy it. It's really is one of the best widely distributed beers available.  Overall: I love Unibroue. I have been to the Quebec providence so many times but have never made it to their brewery which is such a shame. They make pure representations of Belgian brews that any brewer would be proud of. They should be ""Damned"" proud of this beer because it is one of the best.  Honey grab me another one of these ""Damned"" brews because I love them.  By the way Maudite means ""Damned"". And ""Damn it""... I really like it! I guess that makes me ""Damned"".",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,aluskungs,3.88,"I poured the sediment in by mistake, the label said I shouldn't have, oh well. Because of this the beer is like unfiltered tea in color. A large bubble head that dissipates quickly.  Strong excellent date fig smell. Super fruity with a hint of alcohol.  The taste was very robust like the smell. A little bitter for me. A thick beer with yeast, great after taste with lingering fruit and spice flavors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,kingjames1,4.12,"pours a hazy tea-tinged amber, with a light fluffy head, quickly dissipating to a sticky web. Smells bready, yeast-funky, dark fruits (cherries, plums, and hint of apples), and belgium spice. Taste is more of the same, with a strong, satisfying flavor, yet somehow unremarkable. Good mouthfeel, though slighty watery (surprisingly). Good drinkability for the style. Overall, a descent belgium knock-off, but not great. Go for the real deal instead, or try Ommegang's products.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,tapman,4.75,"I found an 8-pack of assorted Unibrous at my local craft beer store. Here is #1.  Dark brown mixed with blood and rust describes the color, appropriate for 'The Cursed"". Head can be humongous if not pured carefully and I like to pour it to 2-fingers of white foamy goodness.  Tropical fruit aromas mixed with a little red pepper and alcohol. A tangy mild hoppiness stings at the nose and translates into a wine-like dry aroma.  Gone is the alcohol, Hallelujah!! For me a good beer is high in alcohol for the flavors that come out during fermentation(s) yet shows no sign of it in the taste category. Very well done with this brew. Spiced fruit esters (fruit with sweet, peppery balance) overpowers the alcohol. Finishes with a wine-like dryness that bites at the back of the mouth thanks to the tart esters. Certainly a wine drinker's beer if there is such a thing. Wonderfully complex.  Typical of the Belgium ales, very sparkling yet full of texture from the bubbles plus beer consistency due to good ingredients. Still, I prefer the thicker, syrupy beers in this category so I guess it suffers due to personal bias. Whatev.  Highly drinkable. Alcohol is no where to be found in the taste and the high alcohol content would make for a night of good beer with a buzz worth your money. I know its faux pas to drink to get drunk in the craft scene, but if that's what you want this brew could do it, or not if you prefer. So tasty and complex, I'll drink these until there's nothing left of me. OYE!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,Night,4.45,"Pours amber-crimson with copper and purple tones. Rapidly foaming gold-beige head dies down to a solid chunky layer. Light arced lacing. Aroma is warm and yeasty: banana, earth, and dust complemented by sweet cookie dough malts, hints of vanilla, wine, and cream. Distant peppery hop spice. Mouthfeel has a soda-like bite with lots of sharp, tingly carbonation. Flavor matches aroma quite well: sweet bread and dough malts are rounded out by a strong banana yeast flavor. Juicy fruits (gala apple, bosc pear) in the distance along with the mildest touch of earthy bitterness and piney hop spice. Aftertaste is long, soft, and sweet.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,irishkyle21,4.4,"Poured into my favorite goblet with yeast sediment added as well ( I prefer this beer with the sediment added). Beautiful dirty white head that last till the end ( sounds kind of funny the way I worded that). Has a brownish red color this beer does wonders on the eyes.  Fruity, spicy and yeasty tang all come threw the nose and the taste. The malt is also present on the tongue and hop bitterness at the back of the mouth. One of my regular beers and also one of my favorites. Reviewed this one after a long night working the bar and it was refreshing and relaxing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mshallah,4.6,"12oz brown bottle with gold foil on the neck and cap. Have always loved the label of the ""damned"" rowing their canoe as satan looks on. Label informs bottle refermentation, 8%abv, best before 10/25/08, and glassware recomendation. Pours clear amber when care is taken to leave the yeast in the bottle. A foamy tan-white head makes the beer look very inviting in the glass. Aromas of candy sugar, confectioner's sugar, belgian yeast fruitiness, lemon iced tea, pepper spiciness and a wine-like alcohol. Taste has a cookie sweetness from the malt and all of the same complexities as the aromas mentioned. Let warm to sip and savor. I believe this was my personal cross-over belgian(yeast) beer. It will appeal to pale ale drinkers that seek complex, unique brews.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ZimZamZoom,4.4,"Poured a 12 oz. twisty into my Maudite tulip glass. I've had the glass for a couple years but this is my first time drinking the beer.  Nice deep amber that is almost brown, with a thick tan head that leaves surprisingly little lacing.  Smells yeasty with some alcohol and a hint of dark fruits and some spice. Chopped dates and prunes come to mind.  Plenty of Belgian yeasty funk upfront in the taste, followed by the prunes and spice. The alcohol in the taste comes during a long dry finish.  A bit heavy and very smooth in the mouth. There seems to be an immediate buildup of carbonation on each sip, that leads to a creamy or almost frothy mouthfeel. This is a highly drinkable Belgian strong dark ale, and I will be sure to seek it out again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,coalcracker,3.92,"Appearance: Pours a darker golden hue with an effervescent head. Smell: Pleasant aroma with notes of raisin and sweet fruit. Taste: Sharp bite early. The alcohol is noticeable here. Again, hints of sweet fruit (apple, pear) as its tamest. Harsher notes of raisin, fig also present. Malt is not too heavy in this brew. The alcoholic jolt just tends to kick in a little too strong early on, IMO. Mouthfeel: A real kick in the mouth! Bites you early, but smooths out just a bit throughout the tasting. Drinkability: I could see myself having only a couple of these in one session, despite its attributes.  Overall: Not a bad strong Belgian, just a little unbalanced IMO.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,PBRstreetgang,4.05,"Pours an amber-tinted rusty orange color with good clarity before the yeast pour. Watch out- its a gusher! Rocky soap-bubble head finally settles to a one finger cap and holds well but leaves poor lacing. Spicy belgian phenolics and ripe tropical fruit aromas like orange peel and apricot, with toasty malt and rose alcohol in the background. Sweet pale malt and mild steely caramel upfront, followed by the typical phenols of the propriatory Unibroue strain; peach and apricot, white pepper, hints of coriander and melon, etc. Their house yeast is not for me; as usual it lends a particularly dry and boozey aftertaste that mutes the delicate noble hop flavor and the alcohol warmth is more obvious than it should be for 8% ABV. However, the mouthfeel is again quite nice, and as the bottle states, even smoother than usual. Sugar thinned body with ample carbonation to help cleanse the palate and keep the malt and yeast character from becoming distracting. Finishes dry and a little boozey but fairly clean, a respectable drinkability. Not exactly a textbook Strong Dark Belgian ale; and the yeast accent is less aggresive than most of the Unibroue line. Some people will appreciate that fact and find this a milder but still complex and fair-balanced choice in the Unibroue line-up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,LittleCreature,4.2,"Appearance - 4.5 Gorgeous. Poured three fingers of loose off-white head which rapidly reduced to a half finger where it stayed. The colour is a deep, dark mahogany; reddish brown and rather solid.  Smell - 4.5 Very pleasant, although not as strong as I had hoped. The alcohol is immediately evident, although accompanied by vanilla spongecake, berries, sultanas, candied hazelnuts, and burnt sugar.  Taste - 4.0 The alcohol is very apparent at first taste, and does not diminish until the delicious aftertaste. Flavours include sweet malt, sticky brown sugar, pineapple and cinnamon. Bitterness is low to moderate, and quite well balanced with the other flavours. The aftertaste as before mentioned, is divine.  Mouthfeel - 4.5 Feels amazingly full and rich. Reasonably heavy in the mouth, carbonation is low, goes down really smoothly.  Drinkability - 4.0 I could actually see myself wanting a second of these in one sitting despite the potency. It goes down smoothly, and tastes better towards the bottom of the glass.  OVERALL - 4.25 A really excellent belgian strong ale. This is more approachable than some strong ales, and gets better when it warms up. It's very expensive, but also pretty damn special, so definitely worth it for the once-off. It leaves one with a lovely warmed feeling, wonderful on a winter's night. The only disappointing element is that the alcohol is not all that well hidden (Rochefort 10 at 11.3% hides it's alcohol better). Would go really well with a quality pizza, I may try this again, especially if I can find it at a better price.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,gunnerman,4,"Poured into a snifter pours an amber reddish color with a foamy fluffy head that leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is of malty raisons fig and bread with a bit of sweet alcohol smell in the nose. Taste is pretty good with a bit of candy sweetness very clove and leafy, also a bit of alcohol burn not overbearing, the sweetness tastes llike a hefe to me with that strong bready finish. This was a pretty great tasting beverage and my first from Unibroue, I was very pleased and would drink again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Mandrake,4.1,"Pours a barely hazy deep orange-red with a big pale head that lasts very well and leaves substantial lacing. Smell is of the classic Unibroue yeast and lots of breadiness, crisp fruits like apples and berries, with darker notes of plum and raisin complementing them. Caramel and brown sugar are in the mix as well. Taste isn't as complex or well rounded, though it still holds its own. The caramel comes through in a big way, and the breads provide a strong background for it all to rest on. A bit of grain and lots of spiciness in the finish, though a bit of alcohol shows as well. Surprising, as I didn't get that sense from the higher ABV Trois Pistoles. Mouthfeel is good, full and highly carbonated, and drinkability is good. Nice beer, but could be better.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,soulgrowl,4.13,"Appearance: Hazy apple cider nutmeg brown. Solid Cream City brickish head with fine bubbles and excellent retention.  Smell: Spicy and earthy and fruity and sweet, almost like smelling a basket of apple spice potpourri (from a distance). Light peppery musk of coriander and the sweet essence of orange peel brighten a bready and somewhat brown sugary body with notes of fall leaves, caramel corn, and almonds. Nice.  Taste: Very well balanced and surprisingly sprightly, with a light and lively flavor despite a sweet malt base and high ABV. Very cola-esque in its combination of dark sugars, citric acidity, and herbal spice. Orange, coriander, and spicy alcohol punctuate a tide of rum raisins and apple peels. Good stuff.  Mouthfeel: Somehow manages to be both creamy and sparkly, though at times this can feel a bit too thin and sometimes too drying. An unusual but generally good balance, well-suited to the flavor.  Drinkability: This is a very nice beer. I do wish for a bit more heft from the malts and perhaps a slightly more forward yeast presence, but as it is this is a very drinkable and tasty brew, complex and robust yet not overwhelmingly boozy. Another winner from Unibroue. Very, very good with aged Gouda.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BeerBelcher,4.09,"The last time I had this beer (perhaps 14 mos ago) I was none too impressed with it, but on this try I think it's excellent.

This beer is extremely pleasant.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,John_M,3.95,"I've been a big fan of this beer for a long time, but I'm wondering if Unibrou has tweaked the recipe. It just doesn't seem to have quite the richness and intensity of flavor it once had, though there's no denying it's a very good beer.  Had this one on tap at Mahaffey's tonight.  Pours a very nice copper, amber orange colar, with excellent head retention and good lacing. On the nose I don't get all that much... maybe some ginger and rootbeer. Still smells pretty enticing. On the palate there are some nice flavors of citrus, cherry, apple and rootbeer, with a bit of tartness in the finish. A nice beer, but the mouthfeel is a bit light and almost watery. The beer finishes very cleanly, but for my money give me the Fin du monde or the don de dieu any time.  A good beer, but not the best from Unibroue IMO.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Tasty beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,basica,4.5,"This is my second Unibroue beer and as expected unibroue does not fail to disappoint. The Maudite (pronounced ""mo-zit"", meaning ""damn"") smells fruity and floral and and it pours out dark red brown with a pretty generous head that quickly fades into a thinner but nice and creamy head. The Maudite tastes hugely fruity, with significant dashes of dark cherries and dark berries. It is also yeasty and very slightly spicy and it all contributes to a pleasant full bodied taste. It could do well if added with a slight hint of sweetness to the taste. The finishing from every mouthful was a slightly alcoholic and dry; would work better if with a smoother finish but I realized that when I was finishing the beer by gulping in the final 2 or 3 mouthful, it was rather drinkable albeit going strong at 8 ABV. The after taste is nicely fruity and floral and pleasant; a pity it was not as lasting as I hoped but all in all I liked it a lot. The Maudite had a slightly different fruitiness to the Trois Pistole and that was evident in the smell, taste and after taste and i liked the difference though on the whole I prefer the Trois Pistole. Overall, the Maudite is a great beer and my only problem, as mentioned, is the finishing during the pause per mouthful or sip. If improved, it may well rise above the Trois Pistole.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BBM,4.32,"Poured a smooth, rusty orange color with a foamy white head atop the brew. The aroma was very complex and pleasant, with hints of fruits, spices, and a bit of alcohol.  Fortunately the flavor is just as complex, blending Belgian spices, dark fruits, figs, and a solid malt profile. There is a warming alcoholic finish, but it's in no way overpowering. Mouthfeel is medium, and crisp. This is an excellent brew, and another winner from Unibroue. I'm a big fan of this one. Recommended if you can find it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mikesgroove,3.98,"Poured a deep dark russet brown with lots of carbonation leading to a large off white head, great retention and a significant lace. Smell was fruity, lots of pear, apple and fig hints with a tiny bit of alcohol. The taste followed along the same line, lots of robust flavors, with a decent warming on the feel. Nice smooth feel and a good all around beer. This was another fine offering from Unibroue, everything I have tried from them to date has been excellent, this was no exception. Lots of yeast led to a lively feel on the palate. Great brew, and nice to be able to have it on tap.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,diamondc,4.38,"Served from a 750ml bottle.  Not much to look at (nice head tho') and a familiar fruity aroma that's definetly Unibroue. Taste is of citrus first, honey graham crackers, and finally a dark cherry taste warming up. Not as in your face as La Fin du Monde.  Good amount of carbonation and with the alcohol virtually undetectable, this a perfect five in drinkability & mouthfeel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

When I ordered this beer, I didn't know what to expect, but it is has definite Belgian Ale character. Nice, peppery hoppy flavor, but clean finishing. Yummy.  Mouthfeel: A bit thinner than expected. Not bad, but not outstanding.  Drinkability: Nice clean finish leads to good drinkability.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,prototypic,3.65,"Appearance: It pours a deep reddish brown color. Thick, foamy two finger head. Very good retention and a nice coat of lace remained.  Smell: It's initially a very spicy smell. Mostly an herbal spice aroma. There's a bit of dark fruit there (perhaps plum) It smells very malty and has a bit of a biscuity-yeasty smell to it.  Taste: It's definitely spicy. It does have a crisp, fruity taste to it. It's actually quite a bit more refreshing than I expected. It's got a nice malty taste and leaves a bread-like aftertaste.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's on the lighter side of a medium body. Drinkability is pretty good and would probably be even better for bigger fans of the style. One is enough for me in a sitting. Overall, it's a good beer. Not something I'd drink regularly, but would certainly drink again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A bit bitter aftertaste.  M - Lots of carbonation and it feels really great on the tongue.  D - Almost lethal; you can definately drink a few too many of these. There's almost no sign of the alcohol.

22,33,BuckSpin,4.38,"Presentation: 12oz bottle (Best by of 8/16/08), cellared for almost a year in my possession, in a flared tulip/thistle stem  Poured with a small gurgle and steady hiss from the rising foam. Classic Unibroue spicy nose, clove, ginger, a little anise even. Yeasty, full of crackers, toast crusts, some subtle dark cherry. As it blooms it gets sweeter, lighter, slightly fruity, more cherry, some raisin & clove. Faint summer field florals dance over a s delicately sharp alcoholic glow. A crazy, sticky, huge 3 fingers plus (even with pouring at an angle & slow) of the palest blanched almond hued foam, thick, slightly sculpted, eventually only settling to a finger's worth of the same. Some agitation restores it to 2 fingers worth that laced very sporadically.  The body is a deep, hazy, rich, brassy, slightly rusted cherry amber with a steady parade of bubbles rising from the etched base. A welcome beer for eyes & nose alike.  Mmm..very rich, somewhat creamy, full bodied. Nicely spiced, pleasing clove, yeasty, soft banana, faint black pepper. A semi-dry mouthfeel with a light crunch is offset with a somewhat syrupy, fruited sweetness. The malts bring a burnt caramel bittersweetness to the dance, and everyone rejoices and sings. What is really nice is that this is very easy (and therefore a little dangerous) to drink. Perhaps the year resting tamed it a little, but its very nice, very drinkable and I am enjoying it very much.  The alcohol begins to rise on the initial taste as aromatics that penetrate the sinuses, but the real show begins on the palate as a soft, cool fire slowly ignites, warming the whole of the mouth, priming it for more taste experience - a delectable Catch-22. Its growing more bittersweet, yet the clove quality remains strong. The finish is soft, subtle, sweeter, more caramel, slightly thick, a very warm mouthglow remains, coating, semi-sweet, numbing the teeth.  This was wonderful, a very enjoyable beer & beer experience. It appears that this cellars very well in that it was so damn drinkable yet tasty and with a nice kick to it. I could see it pairing with things like Thai where sweet, sour, spicy, etc. all interact. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

I asked for a sample and was unimpressed. Since then I have discovered and develop an appreciation for the style. With an impending trip to Montreal, I decided it was time to try Maudite again.  The beer is a mahogany brown with a rocky off-white head.  The aroma is spicy with a hint of alcohol.  The taste is spicy, malty, slightly nutty, and biscuit-like.  Mouthfeel is bready in the center of the tongue with a crisp finish around the edges.  Drinkability is good with this beer. A great sipper. Try it if you find it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

It seemed like a fresh bottle, complete with soapy bubbles inside after the first pour. The thoughts of great champagne came up with thousands of little bubbles coming from the bottom of my chalice. It looked great as I reached for the first taste with a reddish brown cloud in the glass. The first taste reminded me of a great dubbel with a yeast edged malt body and the pop of hops every now and then. The second taste led to a third as the bottle slowly emptied.  This was great find and I made a mental note to try it on tap when I find it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,therica,3.58,"A= Poured a cloudy tea-color with a foamy fine-bubbled large head which gradually dissipated after a few minutes, leaving some residual lacing on the side of the glass stein.  S= ginger ale, sourdough-bready malt & yeast and a little fruityness.  T= very intriguiing, although there are a lot of intriguing beers with some simple twist. The simple twist in this seems to be something like what another reviewer mentions, wild curry possibly, which would give it the slightly tangy bitter fruity taste. Or, at first impression, some hints of tangerine and apricot or something along those lines. After the immediate pour it had the same ginger-ale flavor as the scent. a bit overcarbomated for my preferences but for a ""specialty beer thrill"" it's definitely worthwhile trying. Slightly Belgian-sour taste, something like uncooked but yeast-risen dough maybe.  M= Smoooth. Slightly sour aftertaste. A little too much sweetness for my preferences.  D= Not very drinkable in quantity, given the 8% ABV and the amount of corrections I've had to make while trying to type this frequently-changing review of observations.

22,33,BretSikkink,4.6,"Cloudy dark amber brew, enjoyed on tap at the Crescent Moon in Omaha. Awesome rocky head flowed up like crazy, spilling quite a bit over the top, true Belgian style. The aroma is a complex mix of dark fruity malt flavors and lighter estery yeast characteristics, backed up by a solid bread all-around nose.  Flavor is magnificent, nearly perfect. Awesome Belgian-yeast strain imparts phenolic ripe fruit flavors everywhere, balanced by a solid sweet malt backbone, with a touch of spicing to lend superb depth (clove is most dominant but hardly tells the whole story, pepper especially). Little hop flavor, but enough for the beer to be very crisp and refreshing, while packing a great punch at 8%.  A personal favorite, I've revisited several times. Great opportunity to catch it on draft. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,PhiloPsych,3.96,"I am reviewing this beer for a second time.  Color was a slightly orange tan as it poured from the bottle, hazy brownish orange in the glass. There was a big, fluffy, bubbly head that lasted and left lacing down the glass. There wasn't much aroma to speak of, but what there was was sweet and just a bit spicy. The mouthfeel was pretty carbonated and there were lots of visible bubbles at first. Bubbles continued to rise the whole time, too. The flavor is good. I paired it with barbecue beef this time and it didn't hold up as well as I thought it would. I liked it better this time than last time I reviewed it. This is a good beer that I will continue to drink even if not super frequently.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,shadow1961,3.95,"Unibroue's Maudite pours out a rocky head over a deep cloudy amber brew.  The head does collapse fairly quickly, but the active carbonation provides an even quarter inch of foam in my glass. The nose is that fruity, spicy clove typical of some Belgian yeasts, and malt.  The flavor is more of that sweetish malt, with suggestions of fruit and a spicy clove finish. There seems to be a bit of hop in the aftertaste balancing that sweetness.  The mouthfeel is crisp and rounded. Behind everything, of course, pushing the flavors and the mouthfeel is the well balanced alcohol content.  Unibroue is one of the first more extreme brewers I've been exposed to, and one of the best, in my opinion.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The taste is pretty sweet up front, but the spicy, tangy, medicinal cloves and pepper give this beer quite an edge, but a flavor edge thats not off putting and is broken up well with semi-sparkling carbonation. Yeasty and buttery too, fruity notes comming from the malt of tart brambles, and the sugar granules like you find in dates.  Overall: outstanding! Most Belgian strong darks are pretty spicy, but this one is on the spicy side for the style. The aroma really jumped out and grabbed me when I popped the cork. Great complexity, just plain fun to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,rec,3.55,"The pour got me a little excited, revleaing a merky brown body and two-finger of-white head. There was however little lacing after the head dissipated.  At first the aroma smelt dintinctly like Detol (anticeptic), and because of the strength the smell, it's all I could taste upon first sip too - absolutely disgusting, as you would imagine.  Thankfully, I let it sit and tried to clear my head of the relationship between patching up my childhood wounds with cotton buds and this beer. Upon re-visit the extremely full and unpleasant aroma had faded, and I could re-examine without being thrown back.  Sweet malt and apple cirtus were identified first, and then some interesting fragrance I couldn't quite put my finger on - almost like incence.  It began to taste quite good... spice, heavy yeast, citrus and some dark-fruit undertones. This is definately one to drink at 12-15 degrees celcius (cellar temp) - any colder and you might just miss the complexity and get an up-front kick in the pants like I did the first time.  It's definately not a session beer, but one to try before a session - I'll just stress once more that it seems to be a brew that's highly temperature-delicate, so don't drink it too cold!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,udubdawg,4.54,"12 oz bottle  pours an amber brown color, with some tiny particles of floating yeast clouding things, though most of what made it to the bottle sank to the bottom quite quickly. Head is initially tall and foamy, and fades to a thin clinging ring fast.  Nose is really nice. Full. Some alcohol. Spicy and full of fruity apple aroma.  Taste is equal to the aroma, if not better. There's pepper, clove, ginger, and probably some other spices in here. Otherwise there's all sorts of flavors and sensations going on here - a little tart, some caramel sweetness, some plum, apple, and orange fruitiness. Even just a hint of bitter in the finish that I really like - the notes of sour and bitter, combined with the carbonation bite really make this feel like a full-flavored, well-balanced brew. Then that carbonation disappears as this beer descends my throat and I'm left with an intriguing combination of aftertastes and spices. Not filmy, but I'll be tasting this for a bit.  Hey, you gonna drink that? If not, send it my way, cause this is very drinkable, and I guess I'm ""the damned one"" - I'm all out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,roblowther,4.57,"Poured from a 12oz capped bottle. It is a hazy brownish-orange with a thin, persistant creamy tan head. Smells of rum-soaked fruits, and dry malt. The taste is fantastic. It's creamy, with the fruits up front, followed by spices and a roasted malty finish. Crisp aftertaste that balances the sweet beginning. The mouthfeel is creamy (I keep using that word) with a nice carbonation conisisting of very, very tiny bubbles. The drinkability is fantastic.

S: Very fragrant yeast aroma. Spicy hops and a slight malt sweetness in the nose.  T: Huge spicy yeast and sweet malt one-two punch. Wow. Also contained within are flavors of nuts, spices, chocolate, earthy & spicy hops, and rum soaked raisins.  M: Slick and dense. Initial prickliness calms down and a calming smoothness swoops in and takes over. Finish hangs around for a long time on the tongue and continues to develop (starts off sweet and smooth and eventually turns a little tart and fruity).  D: A very complex treat. Always excellent to savor and experience this one. Can this be sessioned? Probably not, but, I don't think that's the point with this beer. Drink slowly and enjoy it's subtle nuances.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Color is a dark brown. Aroma is primarily yeast and green apple. Taste is mostly yeast with an interesting blend of apple, citrus fruits, and some plums and raisins. Feel is slightly over carbonated and finish is too dry -- it makes me want a sip of water. Not sessionable with the sweetness and high ABV. One is enough, but it's interesting.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,kernalklink,3.43,"Saw this brew on tap and had to try it fresh- poured a lively carbonated bright amber and the bubbles seemed to explode in my face. Aromas hit my face like a brick- big, flowery belgian yeasts big spiciness and the taste doesnt get toned down at all. This is a belgian strong on steroids. The assualt on my palate was total- sweet malts and a huge, sour, flowery yeast character followed by a spiced aftertaste. Body was light and alcohol undetectable. Now i like my belgians but this one totally destroyed my tongue for a night. There could be such a thing as too much character where this brew is concerned, and for me the drinkability suffered. That being said i still respect the brew and its no holds barred style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Pours a deep hazy red or light brown with a fairly dense uniform light beige head that dissipates relatively quickly, leaving minimal lacing.  Intensely fruity aroma, prunes, figs.  Taste is creamy thick sweet stonefruit, more prunes and figs, and powerful fruity esters.  Mouth is thick and full. Slightly warm alcohol noticed, with a slightly tingly finish.  Overall a very drinkable, very pleasant beers, but not my favorite of Unibroue's excellent offerings. (Of their standards, I like La Fin du Monde better, and probably Trois Pistoles as well.)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,0tt0,4.11,"750 ml bottle. Nice winged devil on the front. (Hands down, Unibroue has the best packaging. I want to hang the labels on my wall.)  I poured this beer into a Duvel glass, and it looks like heaen. A nice, thick half-inch head on top of a hazy coppery brown brew. As far as looks go, its a top 10-er.  On to the nose: Run and raison pop up first, almost like a good Belgian quad. A bit of melon & rip fruit. There seems to be a slight whiff of cakey, caramel malt going on.  Now for the first sip: Quite an interesting thing... A mouthful of fruit--notably honeydew or kiwi, raison, and plum. Bit of grape and apple skin perhaps? The first sip has a crisp tingle on the tongue which is essentially a bookend to the palate karate that ensues after it goes down. Finish is long and exciting.  As for its texture-- silky, creamy, and, overall, terrific.  Another solid beer from this great brewer, though certainly not my favorite (Don De Dieu takes that cake.) Not on par with some of the crazier and more interesting Belgians, but certainly enjoyable and drinkable. Solid thumbs up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,choyhosoi,4.5,I bought this at a Bevmo and didnt know anything about it. I had read the review on the card. I was really impressed with the taste very smooth. The smell was kind of fruity.

22,33,weeare138,4.42,"On tap at Ortino's Northside... Appears a hazy, dark amber with a 2 finger, thick white head of foam. Smell is of of the typical Unibroue yeasty Belgian goodness of spicy, sweet, apple, fresh dough, black pepper, plums, raisins, citrus, & caramel. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with the standout spicy dough that makes it a remarkable, slightly sweet and spicy brew that's addictive. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly warming and toasty with dough, brown sugar, and spice.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Strong is right, carbonated to high heaven is also right. Im not a huge fan of overly carbonated beers, but this seems to be the best of the bunch. Their is a fruit sweetness with a lil bit of hops in the back ground . there is definatly some spice, of which i can not determine, but its there. it bubbles on the mouth like a sparkling wine , maybe a bit less. im torn on theis brew. though i like the beer, there are things i would change.

T: Sweet / dry?...very complex, IMO.  M: Champagne-like carbonation, clean with slight alcohol warming sensations.  D: Considering it's 8% abv, the alcohol is pretty much hidden in confusing taste.

This just smells sweet with oranges, green apples and bananas. At very first sniff, I thought of tropical fruits, exotics ones I'll never get to try. Also nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon, sort of like banana bread in a way.  Taste has banana in the foreground with a spice presence. Cinnamon and nutmeg come through. I picked up a lemon taste, something slightly tangy. I also noticed something similar to pears. There is also a nice, woody taste toward the finish. Oak perhaps?

This beers shelf life is around 5 years and i think that i might keep one of these in the celler and check it out in 1-2 more years.  Served from a 341ml foil wrapped bottle into my second Maudite snifter aquired on ebay by my brother as a Christmas gift to me ( thanks bro ) after an unfortunate incident breaking my first while washing it.  A- The beer pours a foggy dark redish brown, with nice crackling 2 finger thick head, very lively, settles to ring of foam around the glass.  S- Very yeasty, lots of fruit, some aromas of wheat, oranges, some wilds spice as well, very complex nose.  T- Once again with the excellent yeast flavors, spices are very nice with hints of clove, some peppery flavors as well, caramel malt is there, overall a fairly sweet and fruity brew classic of most good Belgians. There is some faint flavors of hops in the finish but almost undetectable. One word&gt;Complex.  M- Sweet, and fairly crisp, medium bodied brew with excellent carbonation.  D- Outstanding I must say.  Overall an immaculate brew from a brewery well know for its quality brews, which are by far the best brews out of Canada.

The first taste is bold, with true hints of peppers, zest of lemons and oranges, and a nice yeast bacground. Very drinkable, the carbonation seems to hide the high ABV quite nicely.

It has a nice clean cut taste when it first hits your tongue and has some semi-sweet characteristics mixed in with some mild lemon flavors; at least this is what I tasted from it. It has a smooth slightly bitter aftertaste that has little hint of any alcohol and makes you want to take another sip.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A cloudy, almost orange/brown color...a nice little head, some lacing sat on the side of the glass.  Not as strong as I expected...almost a lemony essence to the yeasty flavor...very smooth  I could definately drink more than one of these in a sitting...the 8% alc vol can be misleading in the soft, smooth taste",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,joshmickelson,4.85,"This was served just above room temperature from a ""globe"" style glass.  The appearance is caramely brown, very cloudy until it settles. Nice tan head that dissipates pretty fast.  The smell was very similar to the taste. Very spicy with hints of banana.  Like I said, the taste is very similar to the smell. Pretty mild overall, but it had hints of spice, banana. I also noticed the finish had a very slight perfume taste.  The mouth was very refreshing. I found myself wanting to drink it faster than I should. It is very carbonated, giving it a champagne kind of feel. .  The drink ability was very easy. The carbonation masks the 8%ABV very very well.  Overall: I would buy this again. I was very enthused about the multi-dimensional taste that was hard to pinpoint. The carbonation gave it a lovely feel and taste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Very spicey right of fthe bat. Clove, coriander, potporrui, caramel, toffee, with a bit of sweet tropical fruity pineapple, and starfruit.  Very easy too drink and refreshing, prickly carbonation really enlightens the tastebuds. Again pineapple, nectarine, flowery, spicy with earth inhabited aspects. A hint of caramel fills out the somewhat thin mid palate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,peabody,3.56,Pours out a really clear reddish Ice tea color with two fingers of white suds. With these small bubbles there won't be much lacing. Smell is kinda week for this style but still has all the banana and clove and apple peel. Taste is better than the smell. Lots of sweet malt with just a hint of clove and anise. Mouthfeel is really bubbly and nice. Leaves just a hint of clove in the palate and then the alcohol comes into play. I could drink this a bunch but the cost and the fact that Weihstephaner Hefe-Weizen(sp) is a much better drink for the price.!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Quick to recede, the head leaves very little lacing.  S: Classic Unibroue yeast, which I now can really recognize. Mild spice, possibly clove, and a certain alcohol presence.  T: Wonderful...similar to smell, just stronger. Sweetness, dryness, very complex IMHO.  M: Champagne-like carbonation. Bubbly prick, clean with a slight warming sensation.  D: For 8%, the alcohol is pretty hidden in the taste, just not the effect. Terrific taste, just not very sessionable at this high ABV.  Another fine beer from the northerners.

I taste brown sugar, apple cider, typical sour belgian yeast flavor and a bit of wheat and nuts. A hint of banana. Finally spices: coriander, cloves and white pepper. Overall a complex flavor which is more dry than sweet.  The crisp, dry, fizzy champagne-like mouthfeel is very carbonated and prickly on the tongue, leaving the palate clean with the slightest hint of alcohol warming.  Drinkability is excellent. I know this beer should be sipped but I find it hard to drink it slowly.  Maudite seems almost more akin to a dry champagne than a beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

This is a stronger belgian style ale that doesn't wear on the taste buds, making for a nice evening drinker.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bjohnson,4.13,"I believe this is actually a dubbel, but each person has their own opinion regarding this.  A: Pours a murky dark plum color. Almost a reddish brown with a big cream colored two finger head. Excellent fluffy retention with thick coating lacing down the glass. Amazing looking lace. S: Spicy phenols. Figs, cherries, and other dark fruit. Slight sweetness covers the fruit notes. Theres a soft coating feeling to the aromas--almost like theres a soft blanket that rests over the nose--wonderful aromas. T/M: Spicy notes right from the start. Figs, cherries, and sweet plums are all laced with the spicy notes. Wheaty thickness on the palate. Slightly sweet fruit notes take on the wheatyness. Thicker body with an excellently smooth coating feeling on the palate. Big on the palate with a above average abv that is noticeable, to a degree, in the spicyness, but gets couched in the wheat notes as well. D: A very good example of a belgian strong dark ale...err...dubbel from Unirbroue. They seem to cater to flavor rather than style, which I enjoy. None of their beers can be put into a specific category as they transcend categories. Another very tasty offering from our friends to the north.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Burnt-orange color with red hues.  Smell is good. Belgian nuttiness, yeast, light fruit and aldohol. Quite appealing.  Taste is good. Similar to the smell but no alcohol. Spicy and sweet flavors molded together nicely. Aging has mellowed out the alcohol bite and harshness for the better.  Mouthfeel is very good. Aging has also mellowed out the carbonation for the better. Lively in the mouth with a creamy texture. Nicely done.  Drinkability is very good. Once again, the alcohol and carbonation harshness has mellowed making this one an easy drinker.  Overall: Fresh, this beer (and much like the rest of the Unibroue line) has too much carbonation and the drinkability and mouthfeel suffer. Aged, this becomes quite a nice Belgian style ale and leaves a better impression. Recommended when aged.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Heavily carbonated white head that recedes outside-in, leaving a whispy sheet. Lightly condensed lacing that leaves trails around the wine glass.  Ripe, vinous fruity esters: plum, fig, and orange embraced by a heavy spice of clove. Hints of phenols and sharp notes of warming alcohol.  Heavy-handed clove and corriander with a bit of juicy, citric fruit: orange, pineapple, and apple. Off flavors of coconut accompany a warming and lasting alcohol presence. A pleasant, slightly dry and rich maltiness that underly the spice and alcohol presence.  A hefty, medium bodied; full, yet airy. Appropriately carbonated for the style.  A delicately balanced Belgian-style ale; well crafted. Some robust flavors, held in check by each other.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Budlum,4.05,"Pouring this beer produces a tall, dense, off-white head composed of miniscule bubbles. The body is a mixed garnet and amber hue displaying excellent carbonation and a light haze. Head retention and lacing on the glass are excellent.  The nose of this beer screams with the classic Unibroue yeast strain. Stunning and fresh aromas of pears, apples and oranges immediately greet the nose. A faint, brown sugar smell adds complimentary sweetness that blends with a peppery spice. Notes of vanilla and faint hops also mix in the background.  A rush of sweet fruit flavors start this beer very much like it smells. The flavors are quite subdued but with enough strength to get my attention. Light vanilla and a moderate earthy/oak flavor blend together squelching some of the fruit flavors. As with most Unibroue beers, the yeast makes this one special but it does get a little too strong in presentation. None the less, this is still quite the tasty brew.  The mouthfeel is just average. The strong yeast presence tends to leave a chalky feeling in the mouth. Also, carbonation is lacking enough to make this feel sticky.  Drinkability is good throughout. Despite some of the downfalls, this is the classic Unibroue flavor with excellent presentation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Yeast presence is out of balance, but flavors meld into a decent drinking brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Braudog,3.9,"From a 12 ozer, this poured a very dark and opaque orange color (brown when away from the light), with a head of tiny little bubbles. The aroma is one of dried fruits -- raisins, dates and so forth. Similarly the flavor is fruity, but not intensely sweet or citrusy, but instead sugary and very dry, like a dry champagne with a tight carbonation.

22,33,Jwaks,2.78,"Serving 750ml bottle  A churning tornado of carbonation swirls up through a shady orange tinted copper body, spiraling toward a dense half finger thick layer of off-white froth. Thick fluffy lacing refuses to give in an impressive display of true belgian character.  Strong aromas of stodgy brown bread, medicinal herbs and piquant spices bloom on the bouquet revealing hints of orange zest and wild yeast.  Loads of slick and sweet bready malts lead a half-hearted charge on the entry only hinting at a fuller richer and rather spicy mid palate suggesting flavors of corriander, wild yeast, cinnamon and allspice. A clean finish ties everything together with more supportive bready sweet malt, restrained hop bitters and hints of yeast. Spices make an encoure performance on the tail end of the finish and aftertaste leaving a pleasing spicy flavor on the palate. Overall, this beer is yeast and spice driven, while the taste is fairly interesting the flavors are muted and nearly drowned out by slick crystalline and bready malt sweetness.  Mediocre persistence on the finish and a slick medium body don't quite meld with the overly yeasty and spicy character forming a lackluster and hallow mouthfeel. On the other hand a slick malty body lets this go down easy and spicy character lends this beer a bit of complexity to keep it interesting.  This beer is not as tasty nor as full as I remember it being. Unibroue beers seem to have gone downhill in quality recently and each one has an odd yeasty character that doesn't sit well with me.  Overall, I admire this brew's sweet malt body and interesting spicy character but it could have been much better with a thicker chewy mouthfeel, toned down yeast, some dark fruits and a dash more hop bitters for balance.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,paleoplant,4.6,The beer was poured into a chalice and the color and appearance were beautiful. The color was a dark amber with a faint hint of cloudiness. A nice head of foam that soon settled to the rim. The smell was powerful with hops and hints fruit. The taste was wonderful but the carbonation was strong. This settled with successive drinking. The combination of characteristics make me want to drink this beer over and over.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,brdc,4.5,"Nice-looking dark, reddish and hazy beer with a white head that disappears quickly, but leaves a never-ending lacing behind. Powerful but not overwhelming smell of sugary malts, bananas, molasses, and alcohol. A few other smells I cannot identify add to the complexity. Full-bodied, it has a wonderful but again not overwhelming taste, with upfront sugary malts, warming alcohol, fruity esters of all sorts, and something slightly bitter to close it down, so it is not to sweet. Dangerously easy to drink, another great Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Appearance: Pours dark copper hinging on brown with a 2 finger merangue like head that dissipates ever so slowly to a mere 1/2"" head. Somewhat cloudy with visible yeast particles.  Smell: Fruity and sweet with caramel, very floral with a slight citrus aroma.  Taste: Big malts in the beginning with plenty of caramel sweetness followed by fruity esters a slight hop bitterness pokes through. Lots of dark fruit flavors, raisins, plums come to mind along with brown sugar. Slightly dry in the finish making me want another drink quicker than I should.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy with plenty of lively carbonation.  Drinkability/Notes: What a nice BSDA. Big malts upfront with caramel, brown sugar, raisins and plums and the yeast kicks it up with some really nice fruity esters. Very smooth and creamy in the mouth. Dangerously drinkable with alcohol being so well hidden. A perfect beer for a cold winter night and a sipper for sure but I find myself drinking this faster than I should, its just damn tasty and easy to drink.

22,33,MurphysIrish,3.12,"Poured into a red wine glass (closest thing I had to proper tulip). Nice light amber color. Good carbonation. Strong head formation that dissolved to a uniform quarter-inch head.  Nothing spectacular on the nose but for the typical Belgian ""funk"" which was fine but I could distinguish nothing else.  First sip went down and left a metallic/alkaline twinge on the back of my palate which I attribute to the high alcohol content. This disappeared almost completely on subsequent sips and, except for a slight cough-syrupy twang, the alcohol (8%) remained well hidden throughout. Body and carbonation make for a good mouthfeel as well.  Overall, a keeper, I just expected some more hop character to poke through but, then again, perhaps Belgian Darks aren't where we go for hop nirvana?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,pmcadamis,4.67,"A - Poured into a chalice from a big bomber with some cool Unibroue artwork. Medium brown with an orange glow (there is a lighter hue in the middle....instead of around the edges) and very hazy. Tiny streams of bubbles flow uniformly and steadily to the top. The head was about a finger and a half initially, then down to a smokey haze with a thicker collar around the edges. Big sheets of lace leave arcs on the glass.  S - Intensly yeasty, fruity, and vinous. Purple grape skins, fresh pineapple, mango, fruitcake and raisin bread. Dusty and dry Belgian yeast aroma.  T - Rum soaked fruitcake. Sugary sweet maple syrup malt character supports fruity and flowery yeasty flavors while some balanced hop bitterness evens things out a bit and keeps this from being cloyingly sweet. Dry and dusty yeast really comes out at the end.  M - Full bodied with a good amount of carbonation to liven up the thickness. Tingly on the tongue with a long-lived smoldering finish that warms with alcohol and fades into a nice glowing maple syrup warmth.  D - The very nice mouthfeel helps make this one very drinkable while the alcohol warmth is really nice for sipping and relaxing. This is an all around excellent ale. And best of all, it's cheaper than many Belgian dark ales!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Graebner,4.38,"Pours a orange-grey-brown with a finger or two of fine white head that drops to a finger or so. The beer looks darkish and oddly colored til you hold it to the light and see it is actually a dark fiery orange.  Smells bready and sweet, but with a fruity hint, like cake with a berry topping. Esters and mild spice.  Sweet up front, this thing barely waits for you to savor the sweetness before whalloping you with woody notes and sour and some peppery spice. Barely bitter on the end, and a woody taste lingers briefly.  Mouthfeel is good. Almost too much carbonation, it's pretty intense. Otherwise a little slippery alcohol and a medium body.  Overall a very good beer, though not sessionable because of the high abv and the high C02. Still, it's definitely worth sipping on when you want something delicious in your mouth.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Celt44,4.3,"After passing by a Unibroue display at my local grocery, I finally picked this one up. Great corked bottle with brilliant art work. Appearance is a dark transparent copper - lighter than what I expected. Large foamy but relatively little lacing as I drained the glass. Aroma is spicy - clove, ginger. Fruity also. Malt aroma has a strong presence. After a few whiffs the taste lives up to the aroma - spicy and malty. Very good. Cinnamon and pepper come to mind. Mouthfeel is smooth - spice makes for a nice warm feel. Overall an excellent Strong Belgian - alcohol is masked and spicy, smooth character make for a great session brew. Not too heavy or stong. I'm glad I finally picked one up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BlindPig,4.05,A- Dark copper amber body with some orange hues to it. Light tan head sits on top. S- Spices come through nice a clear. Big malt with some light wood and smokiness to it. Tad bits of hops also. T- Big spice flavor with some smoke. The malts and hops really help balance each other out. Leaves a light bitterness on the tongue. Also a few hints of wood come out. M- Medium to full body with low to medium carbonation. D-Very nice and balanced. It is surprisingly easy to drink also.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BMoney575,3.97,"Sampled on 1-27-07  Dark brown/red color with a nice frothy head that lasts the entire glass.  Of course the most apparent scent is of the Belgian yeast, with a fruitiness that is not too sweet or too subtle. Just right.  The taste is of dark fruits, raisin, plum, but not too dark. Much like the smell, there is a sweet fruitiness that adds a lot the the complexity. The alcohol content is good, adds a nice warming.  Mouthfeel is good, a little thin, but in the Belgian style.  The drinkabilty is good, it offers enough to be a good choice even if you're not in a Belgian mood.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bucko,3.53,"This Damned beer pours a translucent copper color with a huge whiteish head that slowly recedes with some lacing and a small ring of foam. The aroma is strong with Unibroue's yeast, dark fruit, alcohol and subtle spice. In the flavor, sweet malt, molasses and spices come through as well as phenols, esters and a bit of alcohol. Mouthfeel is crisp and light. Smooth. Very drinkable, regardless of the 8% alcohol. Nice beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheSarge,3.72,Maudite pours with much CO2 action and the nody is of caramel color and has a very translucent consistency. The head produced is light tan and dissipates rather quickly.  This gives off aromas of caramel and matallic nodes of copper. Tastes like bubble gum and blood oranges. Wet and spicy. Grows warm on the back of the throat.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,SaucyA,4.19,"What a great beer! After trying Blanche De Chambly yesterday, I couldn't help but sample some of Unibroue's other offerings.  I'll reiterate what everyone else had to say... it looks nice, lighter amber coloring with a nice head that retains well throughout the glass. It eventually almost dissapated but left lacing.  Smell's fantastic. Too many smells to list. Yeast, molasses, caramel, light hops, spices.  Taste is great, nearly an overwhelming amount of different flavors. Yeasty, dry, slight alchohol bite. Sweet, fruity... a joy to drink, and doesn't tire. Every few sips can hit you with a nice kick of alchohol, but highly manageable.  The mouthfeel is great, perhaps a little too light... but it helps make this completely complex beer manageable for everyone. I bet I could give this to my macrobrew-loving friends and they'd fall in love with it. It's super sparkly, but has enough body to let a lot of the flavors come through.  The only thing taking the drinkability is the abv, which is a bit too high for a session beer. But if it's a chill out night, where I need to pair a beer with food, or just feel like sipping, I'll definitely go with Maudite.  I would no doubt buy Maudite, and other Unibroue products, again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ojiikun,4.15,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a dark ale tulip. Colour is deep, deep orange that is just slightly foggy with a sprinkling of finest yeast in suspension. Head is quick-up then quick-down, very moist and transient to a ring of white. Not much lacing of which to speak.  Smell is sweet, dark candi, and just a whiff of caramel roast. The sweet notes are of papaya, hawaian rolls, and faintest licourice. Very mild dry notes come across as booze, mineral water, and maybe white pepper.  Taste is surprisingly more dry but quite crisp and tart. Oranges and deceptively light malts lead the show with eventual figs and too many spices to codify at once.  Mouthfeel is condecendingly crisp and light thanks to the respective taste and always-ready carbonation. Booze is noticable on the tongue past 50 or 55 degrees.  For all the flavour in this one, not to mention the ABV, this is very drinkable. An alluring beer, but not without the occasional moment of lingual exacerbation. One or two sips of of 50 were eye watering.  Like all of the Unibroues, this is distinctive, without funk, and heavy on the bright flavours. The only thing holding the taste back from a 5 is the lack of body on which the flavours so desparately want to ride.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smelt of moderate caramel, dark bread, spices, raisins, bananas, dates.  Taste was upfront strong bitter sweet and sour, like drinking rotten raisin juice, if such a thing were to exist, followed by a harsh bitter sweaty and rustic yeastiness with hints of toasted dark bread, light sweet caramel, raisins and spices on a long finish. Palate was light to medium bodied, watery to a dry finish, fizzy and strongly astringent.  Overall, this is a fine smelling brew and the taste is exceptionally interesting, awkward and outlandish. I think I think I like it... I think.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Maltyness to it as well, just great.  mouthfeel was good and went down amazingly  note: all my friends tried it and said this was the best beer that they've ever had, which is no surprise for them.

22,33,mithrascruor,4.85,"750 mL bottle poured into an oversized wine glass.  Appearance: Pours a wonderful hazy dark apricot/brown color with a foamy off-white head that eventually becomes a nice film.  Smell: Wonderful spices (cloves, nutmeg, pepper) and fruit flavors (cherries, apricots), together with a light bready scent.  Taste: A very nice combination of the various spices and fruits mentioned above, plus some added banana and malts. The different flavors seem to take the forefront at different times -- sometimes it's very fruity, sometimes very spicy. But what results is a dynamic yet balanced complexity. Aftertaste has a hint of alcohol with the spices.  Mouthfeel: Great bold medium-bodied feel, a bit tingly with the carbonation.  Drinkability: Strong but tastes great and doesn't get tiring at all. The alcohol flavor is fairly minimal.  This is a really wonderful and tasty beer. From me it gets a very high recommendation to all, and I will certainly get this again. Amazing flavor and great all around. And hey, you can't do much better artwork-wise!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CharlieMopps,4.62,"A: Three fingers of thick, foamy head and a reddish amber/brown hue to the beer itself. Decent retention. Quite an appealing look, served in an oversized wine glass.  S: Mildewy and yeasty, alcoholic and spicy notes come to mind. Smells delicious.  T: Tasty malt notes and a kick of spice are followed by a lingering bitterness and a dry finish. Very well balanced beer, enjoyable as all hell (no pun intended). The multiple flavors going on here make for a palate pleaser.  M: Great carbonation, crisp and refreshing while at the same time thick.  D: The fluidity of flavor, the complexities and subtleties, and feel on the palate make it incredibly drinkable. An amazingly delicious beer that is highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Estarrio,4.6,"While I am a huge fan of Unibroue, I had not yet tried Maudite for some inexplicable reason.  Maudite, or ""The damned one"" is a fine Belgian strong ale and was well worth the wait for me.  Poured cloudy, mahogany with a small but persistent tan head. Viscous, silky lacings line the sides of my goblet.  Sweet malt, clove, pepper, coriander, bready yeast and light fruity esters make for an enticing aroma.  Sweet malt backbone with caramel, candied sugar, molasses, apple and grape esters, doughy yeast and lots of phenols and spices. The first sip starts off like a standard, sweet Belgian Tripel and then the spices and phenols smack some exciting, balancing flavors on your palate. Banana, clove, nutmeg, pepper and cinnamon mix with phenolic properties to create a spicy/bitter, crisp, semi-dry finish. The complexities in the brew are amazing given the 8% ABV and the smooth, refreshing taste. I could easily drink this by the case.  This medium bodied brew has no shortage of delightfully fizzy carbonation for an easy, pleasing mouthfeel.  Another home run by Unibroue. They craft sublime brews with stellar marketing and very reasonable prices. Maudite will easily become one of my staple selections.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,flexabull,4.15,"Pours with vigorous carbonation, huge head that is slow to settle down. Beer is cloudy, a lot of carbonation seen rising to the top... also a nice dull amber color.  Aromas are of fruits, dust, some spiciness, and I also notice a bit of the alcohol. This almost smells a little bit booze like.  First thing I notice when sipping this is the wonderful mouthfeel. The carbonation is perfect, this beer really coats your mouth, and is very creamy.  Flavors are quite nice. A bit lighter than I expected though. Tastes of spiced apples, a hint of hop bitterness, and then a nice creamy finish.  My third Unibroue beer. And they have all been quite good. Drinkablility is there and the slightly lighter body really helps it. Enjoyable and worth a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Geonious,4.75,"This is the first time trying beers from this brewery. So far everyone has impressed me.  Appearance: Amber Red (Mahogany). Nice head that never quite went away. Very good carbonation. Decent lacing.  Smell: Fruity and spicy. One sniff and I knew this was a good choice for dinner  Taste: Very good taste. Fruity. Corriander and other light spices. Hops. Slight Alcohol Warmth. Crisp and clean after taste. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Medium feel with moderate carbonation that lasted for the duration of the beverage.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. I paired this beer up with BBQ pork chops (think Southern Summer BBQ folks) and it was a match made in Heaven. This beer and BBQ is going to QuadFest 2007!!!!  Definitely on the ""Buy Again"" list.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Risser09,3.62,"2006 Vintage  12 oz bottle poured into a Tasting Glass  Appearance: Pours a hazy dark orange and brown color. Lots of head that bubbles an off-white color. 1 inch head that dissipates and leaves a residual laceo on the surface.  Smell: Spicy, and very citrusy...mostly orange. Other fruity aromas are there.  Taste: Peppery at first but not too cloying. The spice hits first and orange zest follows. There is no alcohol burn probably because of such strong flavors. The finish is hoppy and dry, which leaves you begging for more. This is a complex taste, and quite different than others beers of this style.  Mouthfeel: Clean and drying but substantial enough to keep going. Carbonation is present and alcohol becomes warming after a few sips.  Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer but not as much as other Unibroue offerings. La Fin Du Monde is better and so are others. However, I could drink a few of these in one sitting with some great food.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,markaberrant,3.9,"750ml bottle decanted into pitcher and served in Unibroue tulip glass.  Pours a slighty hazy dark orange with excessive carbonation. Large head quickly forms of large and small bubbles, eventually receeding to about 1/4"" inch. Leaves a bit of lacing.  Smell is of fruit, but seems somewhat reserved.  Taste is spicy fruit, finishes with a soft and spicy warmth. Malt lingers on the tongue.  Mouthfeel is light, clean and dry.  Drinkability is average to me. While the alcohol warmth and spice is not harsh, I do find it to be a little much.  This is a good beer. However, I sampled La Fin Du Monde yesterday and found it to be outstanding, and I find this one pales in comparison. Maudite falls right in middle of golden and dark Belgians... a red according to their website. While it does not have any imperfections, it is lacking of any oustanding characteristics... it's just sort of there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,treehugger02010,3.76,"I had this brew in Utah. It was a very good brew. I was a dark red color. It had an extremely malty taste, but a not so malty smell.

22,33,pavandal,3.99,"Poured into my Tulip glass from a bottle. It poured an iced tea color, with a 1/2 inch head on top that looked a bit like whipped cream. Bubbles raced to the top of the beer as I enjoyed, and the head stayed without lacing.  Smell was wonderful! Fruity yeast scents first hit your nostrils, followed by a caramel scent. No hop spiceness here!  This beer is bitter, not in the hoppy way, but in an unrippened fruit way. Taste is dominated by fruity malt, with a slight bready finish. Alcohol warms the mouth as you sip.  Feels very light in the mouth, and is easy to drink. High ABV, but not as high as many Belgian strong darks. Troegs Mad Elf still holds the crown for me, but this is a nice brew to get if you want something that isn't hoppy and is fun to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,gmfessen,4.43,"I've been meaning to try this one for a while. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, and almost all over the floor. Beer has huge bubbling head...pour carefully! Color is a cloudy golden-peach with a white-yellow glistening head. Smell is of Belgian sugar, cloves and other spices, not much of an alcohol nose. Taste is really quite good, mostly sweet of Belgian sugar, with the clovey-spice taste and a dry finish. The sugar taste is not too intense as I find to be the case sometimes with Belgian style beers. Same with the clove/spice. The mouthfeel is awesome, the head has the consistency of light whipping cream, the beer is full bodied and well carbonated. At 8%, this beer is dangerously drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,kzczp0,3.74,"3/4ths head on pour looked great for only a minute or two than disspates to short irregular lace in glass. Appears as a murky iced tea color that has over been overbrewed. Lacing stays at edge of glass throughout the drinking but carbonation is considerably absent after half is drank.  The smell is incredible in that it would rival any Trappist dark brown. Malt, ginger bread, and dried fruits as well as deep floral smells abound.  First impression of taste is malt that breaks into a bitterness that oddly does not relate to hops or alcohol. Mouthfeel is flat with minimal perspective shown. Overall taste and finish remain the same throughout with little complexity demonstrated to my taste buds. Finish is same as begining with an odd bitterness that abounds.  This beer is not rich enough to rival the great ones, but easily fits into it's classification. Not great, just good to me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,alexskovan,4.29,"Poured cloudy amber with a rich off-white head that wasn't going anywhere. Smell was . . . wow. The aroma is the most impressive thing about this brew. Caramel, citrus, yeasty bread. The aroma seemed to change and morph as time went by. For about ten seconds or so, I swear the stuff smelled like tequila!  Taste was a caramal malt attack with fruit and yeast right behind, all nicely balanced by the hops. Smooth and drinkable. Be carefull! You would not know it was 8% if the label didn't say so.  You know, it's a funny thing, I've given this brew a high rating, yet I'm not actually sure if I LIKE it! It's that kind of beer. Strange, complex, worth brooding over. Think I'll have another, and see if I can't make up my mind. . .",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Westsidethreat,4.2,"A: Rich amber-brown, although the darker atmosphere I'm drinking this in may be hindering the light from passing through the beer possibly making it seem deeper in color. The khaki head dissapates quickly due to the medium-sized bubbles.  S: Immediate candy sugar paired with cooked red Bing cherries, and a smattering of copper coins. Smells like there's iron content in the beer. Lighter threads of tomatoe vines run through it as well.  T: Upon the first sip, the flavors transition in the mouth from cherry, to Red Delicious apple to honey dew melon. As it warms up, the elements become more intense with hints of allspice and cardomon with a dash of clove. Full of cozy flavors, reminiscent of a winter warmer.  M: Lighter and dryer than expected -- from the smell one would think it to be a much more syrup-based and cloying beer. Good carbination provides a nice contrast to the flavors.  D: Well balanced beer in all aspects, however there are not a lot of levels or layers of complexity. For most beers it's the opposite, however I almost feel like this beer tastes better from the bottle than on tap. But the flavors are harmoniously aligned to make an enjoyable beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,tcfishler,2.22,"Dark rich mahogany, clear. Tan head of moderate size and good durability.  Nose brings to mind very ripe fruit drizzled with balsamic vinegar and sprinkled with freshly ground black pepper. Other spicy aromas add complexity.  In the mouth, sweet, rich, and fruity. However, this fruit is ripe to the point of spoilage.  I get the similar rotten/oxidative flavors here as I found in Trois Pistoles. I don't know if that's a result of Unibroue's yeast or not, but regardless, it's a complete turnoff for my tastebuds.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,thinkfull,4.22,"Ooh, another Unibroue to try... Happy Happy Joy Joy!  Maudite looks like a deep reddish colored wood stain. The head is huge and white, subsiding to a pearly lacing with excessive stickiness. The smell caught me off-guard at first. The second I opened the bottle I could smell some kind of Thai food; sweet, yet spicy . Black pepper and papaya come to mind as I smell from the glass. Embarrasing moment: I just snorted some of the head trying to smell the beer. I guess that's a vote for Unibroue on this one.  The flavor just simply wallops you. Peppered steak, tropical fruit, and Spumante all come to mind immediatly. Note that none of those flavors is simple, and that all of them are very present. I can think of few wines that can compete for complexity; fine Scotch is more accurate of a comparison. Thankfully, I can put aside one and let it referment for another year or so, and find out what changes. The only quibble I have is that the drinkability is not much a factor in this beer; between the high alchohol content and the complexity, I start to feel like my tastebuds went three rounds with De La Hoya.

After a while you can swirl the glass and it creates a slight swirl in the cap. Stringy lacing along the glass.  Grapefruit and plum strike the nose with the slightest hint of phenols. In the background are hints of alcohol.  Strong fruit presence among a highly carbonated medium-body that lends a crisp bite with each sip. An acidic mouthfeel in the beginning. A slightly sweet malty base that finish with a dry alcoholic taste along with a tiny touch of hops and bits of phenolic flavors.  Once again a good beer by the Unibroue company. A good example of the style. As you get closer to the bottom of the bottle the phenolic quailities become more noticeable. So if you don't like the phenols, leave the last half inch of beer in the glass to prevent the sediment from getting in the rest of the beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Aroma is a bit musky, dominated by yeast and very ripe fruit.  I'm probably drinking this a bit colder than recommended, but still, this beer is delicious. The yeast flavor is as Belgian as it gets, but not too overpowering. A little bit musky, with noticeable suggestions of dried fruit, especially dried apricots - enough that if someone were to ask me ""What's Maudite like?"" my answer would immediately be ""apricots."" Some tangy citrus qualities too. No really overt hop flavor to speak of. Very slightly phenolic, and barely any hint of alcohol sting in the flavor... it's fairly well masked, but leaves a nice warm feeling in the chest.  Spritzy, highly-carbonated, but the mouthfeel is a little too drying, which does take away a bit.  For drinkability... well, I sure won't have a problem finishing this glass, but I think one is enough... not that I'd turn down two. That description deserves a good 4, in my awesome opinion.  I would love to bring this to a classy party/gathering/dinner instead of bringing wine. I think it'd pair well with sharp cheese and dried fruits, particularly.

22,33,biegaman,3.98,"Although the story of 'Maudite' (""the damned"") is a Christmas one, you'd have to agree there's something Halloween-y about it, not the least for its pumpkin orange colour and jack-o-lantern glow. Transparency is misted in a dense fog that also dims the beer's natural shimmer if left out of the light. Its head, too, casts over the beer like a big cloud.  The aroma has a bit of sugar, a bit of spice and, indeed, everything is nice. The sugar, which is secondary, comes from a lightly toasty maltiness with faint caramel undertones. The spice, which is considerable, comes from a most effervescent, Belgian-bred yeast that pushes notes of bruised banana and fiery peppercorns right up the nostrils.  The flavour actually resembles something of a mulled apple cider, one accented with wildflower honey and toasted breadcrumbs alongside the customary cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Its sweetness is too distorted by the spice to be considered caramel or toffee-like, but it lends itself to the aftertaste along with a pleasant dried fruitiness.  The bubbles are soft and easy on the tongue, allowing the full savor of the spiciness to be appreciated as it wanes between warming and full out five-star piquant, depending on things like temperature and age. Speaking of which, in my experience, Maudite is not a beer that ages all that gracefully. If you want to experience it at its best, drink it fresh.  Maudite is damn good beer from a brewery that, with very few exceptions, makes only exceptional offerings. Maudite is at least a serviceable Belgian-style ale; t is a beer that most people should find zestful, pleasurable and gratifying, a most charming 750ml acquaintance to make that, arguably, might be worth selling your soul over.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

T: Spicy banana bread, with plenty of fruit, like having fresh banana bread with about four different kinds of jam on top. I'm getting some apricot, lemon zest, a bit of pineapple, some cinnamon, and some black pepper. Finish is lightly bitter, alcohol is only slightly noticeable.  M: Slightly chewy. Like all Unibroue beers, the carbonation is pretty evident.  D: Really enjoyable. It presents itself as being a mix of a hefeweizen and a Belgian Pale Ale, with some witbier characteristics; the abv puts it out of ""session"" territory, though. It's a nicely balanced beer, with some great fruitiness.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,wedge,4.17,"12 oz. Best Before: 03-20-09  Reddish amber in color with a big foamy head that holds well. Smooth aromas of spicy fruit esters - dried banana and corriander quickly gives way to a beautiful doughy yeastiness. Certainly has the taste of a strong ale. A initial fresh maltiness dissolves into spicy, appley alcoholic esters after swallowing - moderate phenolics in the center. Warm and complex...but not too complex. Very smooth and pretty well balanced; fills the mouth but its not too heavy.  This one is still young and its great! I'm definately going to age some of these in the future. Hits the spot when in the mood for a Belgian ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Doomcifer,3.87,"Pours a ruddy/murky dark copper color with a decent head that fades down to a centimeter and sticks around. Smells of yeast, caramel, buttery tones, light hops, bready, cherries. Taste is along the lines of the aroma, ending semi-dry. Lots of yeast, ripe fruits, spices, cherries, toffeeish, tartness, alcohol is very well hidden for an 8% abv brew. Mouthfeel is airy with lots of fizzy bubbles not unlike that of champagne. Decently drinkable, but wouldnt overdo it. I could see myself burning out on these quickly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Grundle20,3.5,"Appearance: Pours a deep amber into a snifter, pretty damn hazy. The beer has a decent large bubble head with minimal retention and lacing.  Smell: Strong malts and caramel dominate the nose, but there are lesser notes of English hopping.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Pretty light and crisp given it's overwhelming malt presense in the smell. Lots of carbonation bury the delayed flavors of rich chocolate and malts. The alcohol is pretty well hidden by the carbonation rush and lingering flavors.  Drinkability: It's high in ABV, but that aside I find this to be one of the more drinkable dark beer/malty beers I've ever had. So there is a trade of in overall flavor vs. drinkability with this brew.  Bottom Line: Again another unique take on a style from Unibroue. It seems to me that they have this affinity for highly carbonated beer which drinks light and easy. Check it out, it's a pretty interesting beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smells yeasty and fruity (pineapple, black currant), with dry, savory wood and mushroom notes. Some malt, and faint alcohol.  Tastes of yeasty brown bread, pineapple, black currant, black cherry, brown sugar, some spicy heat like allspice or clove, rich and delicious. A hint of leathery gaminess. Some fresh, herbal hop flavor. Really good.  Carbonation is rich and creamy without fizziness, there's also some slight astringency and prickliness on the tongue. The mouthfeel and flavor profile both suggest that a few brett cells were judiciously allowed into the party, and livened it up perfectly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,phisig137,3.75,"Corked bottle pours a dakr orange-red hue, with a thick three finger head. Great retention, and decent lacing.  Aroma is sweet and yeasty. All of the typical Unibroue spicy yeast aromas are there, along with caramel, toffee, and malt.  Flavor is again, quite yeasty. The flavor of that Unibroue yeast is so distinctive, and I am surprised how well it is able to brew a light, dark, triple, double, and all taste as they should, but all have the same charictaristics. Really impressive to me. Slightly sweet, with great malt charictaristics. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, considering the gravity of this beer, and the amount of flavor. Drinkability is good.  Another hit for Unibroue... They have really mastered many of the belgian styles, and rarely disappoint. There are better Strong Dark Ales out there, but this does not have any major flaws. And when you consider the price, this is a solid winner, dollar for dollar.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,JOaikido,4.2,"341 ml bottle.  A- Very nice reddish dark amber colour. Off-white head that settled to a thin foamy layer and eventually dissappeared. Very appealing streams of fine bubbles in the beer.  S- Sweet odours dominate, malt, caramel and fruit (citrus).  T- Unibroue yeast prevails. Nice taste of malt with a touch of bitterness to balance. Fruitiness in background. Alcohol quite noticeable but seems to fit with this beer.  MF- Very nice ""roundness"". Carbonation just right. Maybe a little pastiness left behind though.

22,33,malcontent,4.18,"Gotta love a beer in a snifter! Nice, solid head that holds firm atop a cloudy, caramel colored body. Head climbs slowly down the sides leaving a trail of goodness along the way. Excellent lacing. A (dare I say it?) sexy looking brew.  Smells like champagne, currants & malt. Intriguing to say the least.  A wine grape first rush followed by dark, malty characteristics with slight hop bitterness & bready, earthy flavors. Almost herbal in its aftertaste but very crisp.  As previously mentioned, exceptionally crisp, very reminiscent of Duvel in this respect. Not as heavy as the hue would otherwise indicate.  NOTE: after initial tasting, paired this with some smoked gouda & Italian salami which really brought out the fruit notes in the beer. A really lovely beverage.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,vanrassel,4,"I like this beer and have come to that opinion after having it several times, but I have to admit it's still one I don't entirely ""get"" and find it hard to describe.  Appearance is easy enough: a large two-finger head over top an effervescent, tawny-coloured body. I start running into trouble trying to pick things out of the aroma. I can perceive yeast, some brown sugar and ripe fruit, but not the kind of detail others seem to be able to draw from this beer. The taste, to me, is a pleasant tug-of-war between some light malt and spicy cloves. The brown sugar is in there  and vanilla?  This is a full-bodied beer that ends with a little stickiness on the palate and a nice warming alcohol effect in the belly. Even if I don't completely understand it, I know I like it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,alysmith4,4.02,"Couldn't find Fin Du Monde, and had to go with this other offering from Unibroue. Normally, I prefer the Belgian (strong) pale ales, but I was pleasantly surprised by this dark brew.  It was rich and sweet, and had a long lasting flavor. Each sip was better than the last, especially as I let the beer warm in the glass. Very drinkable, and one that has turned me on to others in this style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,sacrelicio,4.72,"Now this is balance in a belgian dark! This beer pours into a chalice beautifully with a ruddy orange-brown color and a nice, foamy, cream colored head. The retention is nice to see, and my Chimay chalice compliments the appearance of this beer well.  The smell is good, if a bit one dimensional. Green apples dominate, with some honey wheat bread notes intermingled. Ahhh....smells like a white wine, like a crisp unoaked chardonnay or Spanish Viura. Wonderful. I'm giving this another half-point.  The taste is classic Belgian dark, with all the spicy, sweet malty goodness with yeasty esters followed by tart fruits like the aforementioned green apples. Some serious bitterness in the finish. Nice to see, not always the focus of a belgian of any color. The are alo some savory, meaty, smoky notes in there as well. Always tart.  The mouthfeel is nothing special, but it's fizzy and fairly light. Not bad, but lacking the creaminess of a belgian dark. The upside is that the lightness leads into the next category...  Drinkability! Exceptional. This is a Belgian dark you could drink all day. The alcohol is hidden, the body is light, the flavors are refreshing, and the balance is top-notch. This would be a great starter beer for a Belgian novice, or a good fridge standard for the Belgian fan. Being a good buy only helps the ubiquity of this brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The head easily lasted (though I probably drank this beer a little too quickly!). Smelled like a Christmas cake mix before going into the oven; fruits, dough, a little alcohol. Tasted superb, a complex mix of the aforementioned smells, alcohol subdued, just excellent. This is easily a top notch Belgian dark ale, only smoother than many.

Also a sort of yeasty or bready hint lies beneath. Very interesting.  Tart and slightly spiced. A very refreshing and interesting brew, unlike any I have tried. Seems to have a lot of citrus zest at first sip. Orange, lime, maybe lemon. The spice and sweetness resides midway thru each sip. The finish contains the yeasty component. Really great stuff!  Mouthfeel is crisp and zippy. Fairly high initial carbonation.  Drinkability is high. Wears it's ABV well, seems quite moderate and quaffable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,RedChrome,4.42,"The body had a very nice light to medium copper color. A slight off white head of two inches faded rapidly leaving a fine quarter inch coating on top. Massive amounts of tiny carbonation bubbles can be seen rising. Nice clumpy lacing.  Very fruity aroma. A nice first smell and a blend of light fruit scents. I can identify apple, pear, and banana very readily. A second sniff also brings a malted back to the fruity aroma. Very nice treat on the nose. The smell is not to sweet as to push you back, and finishes with a warm hint of alcohol.  A great tasting beer. Spicy bite in the first sip had a nice appeal. There is a noticeable light crisp tart apple taste very similar to granny smith apples. A second sip also had a distinct malt note that brought a light caramel sense, even though not a strong one. A nice finish had both a clove and white pepper blend to leave a spiced aftertaste.  Good feel. Coats the entire interior of the mouth. A decent burst of carbonation tingles the taste around on the tongue.  Very nice offering. This would be a very nice selection to pair a garlic cheddar as an appetizer early on at a dinner party. Definitely a head above most beers in the style, and a must try for anyone.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,xymyl,4.46,"Hazy dirty deep gold/bronze medium large/large bubbles thick frothy cream colored head that lasts quite a while. Medium carbonatiion. Very broad and complex malt and yeast aroma. Fruity and floral with banana peel and cloves dominating the profile.  The flavor starts with cloves and ends with pepper. You can find banana in it but not like the aroma suggests (there is however a tartness much like an unripe banana that surfaces toward the end (hopnanas?)). A lot of fruit and spice and there is a great caramel flavor that combines with delicate slightly burnt notes throughout.  Mouthfeel is amazing, rich and light at the same time (a trait often found in good Belgian beers), just perfect (the alcohol helps it along). You could drink this at any speed and enjoy it quite a bit, but you should probably give yourself some time and drink it as it warms. That's what I do.  Other notes that are unimprtant to you: Unibroue is one of my very favorite breweries. I love the way they have interpreted Belgian beer styles. Our dog is even named Maudite. She likes beer, but only gets a few drops on rare occasions (beer isn't good for dogs you know).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,elricorico,3.88,"Pours a medium brown with plenty of redness to it. A bit hazy. A thick foamy ivory head forms, and is slow to recede. Looks pretty good.  Smells of yeast and pepper mostly. A little bit flowery. Inoffensive but I don't find it an aroma that I keep digging for.  The front of the tongue gets a semi sweet fruity mix with candy sugar. As it passes through the mouth the taste turns over to a yeasty and spicy flavour, that is fairly drying. I'd say that coriander is in there, and am almost convinced that there is a hint of cinnamon. Somewhere in the mix a tart apple appears. Lots here, interesting and tasty.  Lively carbonation with a fairly light body for the darker Belgian styles. The mouthfeel isn't amazing, but certainly is good.  This one is a bit odd for me. When I have a bottle it certainly goes down well, and has enough complexity to entertain and please my palate, but still I rarely think about picking this one up. I think it has just been overshadowed by the darker of the Belgian Darks out there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Frothy head that settles after a while to a nice ring and single layer of tiny bubbles almost foamy.  S- Alcohol, sweet, peppery. Touch of berry smell maybe?  T- Complex to start; rich with sweet, alcohol, fruity. The middle is a touch bitter and hoppy, alcohol fades a bit, finishes sweet and malty.  M- Great, like a lot of Belgian Dark Ales. Smooth despite the strength of alcohol. Not too carbonated but fizzy enough to make my tongue happy.  D- I think this is a great beer. Reminds me a lot of the Ommegang Abbey Ale, but a bit rougher around the edges. Something to keep on hand.  Can't wait to age this stuff and see if the wrinkles iron out a bit. :-)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Lovely hazy honey-brown color, moderate head fills the glass but dissipates fairly quickly without much lacing.  Aroma hits you with that fantastic fruity yeasty floral winey scent that immediately fired the brain cells that shout: ""Duvel!!!"" Could sniff this all night. Gotta taste this side by side with the venerable Belgian at some point.  More carbonation on the tongue at first which weakens with time. Head wafts away to nearly nothing. Taste does not disappoint, wonderfully complex interplay of sweetness, bitter finish, everchanging array of tangy spices, definitely clove, coriander? nutmeg? Extreme deliciousness. So similar to Duvel in many ways but comes off a bit heavier and more hoppy in the end. Wonderful beer!!! I am so excited to try the other Unibroues!!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

This beer seems a bit more effervescent than most other Belgian strong dark ales I've had and I love that. It smells wonder full, of belgian hops and spices, mild notes of bread and maybe a hint of fruit, but only in the smallest way. The taste is great, clean and fresh not heavy like some B.S.D.A.s. Hints of coffee, carmel, bread and spices. The finish is the best it simply demands more. The ABV is just at the right places for strength and drinkability.

After awhile I realized that the orange was not from the orange but from the beer. Citrus fruits. It really is a gorgeous beer. Like a muted amber/brown. Head doesnt last long. A solid ring of bubbles resides along the walls due to very active mild carbonation. It's warm. Alcohol isn't masked at all. A champagne amongst beers.

22,33,Generik420,4.28,"First thing, the label on this bottle is one of the best I have ever seen. It truly gets you ready to drink something that is out of the norm. I unfortunately don't have the proper glassware for a beer of this style so it was consumed in the traditional pint glass, and for that I am sorry. First thing I noticed was the aroma. The aroma does not match the flavor at all in my opinion. The closest way for me to describe the aroma is to say it smelled like wort during the boil. If you have homebrewed, or taken a brewery tour, then this will hopefully make sense. The aroma smelled somewhat hoppy, maybe a little earthy. The flavor though, was pure Belgian delight. It has a fairly malty backbone, with a hint of sourness, and a nice touch of hops. Taste had a hint of alchohol hotness present, reminding the drinker that this is a higher ABV beverage. You definitely do get a nice mellow warming feeling while drinking this. Color is a somewhat dirty brown, very hazy, and fairly carbonated. This was cheaper then many of the true Belgian imports, making it a somewhat budget entry for the style without sacrificing on quality.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dblinkhorn,4.8,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance - This head is alive! The brew is very active with carbonation at first pour, and the head consists of partly tiny silky bubbles at the bottom, to larger bubbles toward the top of the head. The beer is a brownish amber color that is very clear. If you pour the whole bottle at once, or hurriedly, you will disrupt the layer of sediment at the bottom and this will severely fog the brew.  Smell - The last beer I tasted was the Achel 8 Blonde, so the perfume coming from this glass is a much stronger and complex aroma. As per usual with this style, it has a dominant smell of dark ripe fruits. However, there's something different about this smell I can't put my finger on, but it is enchanting. The hop aroma is more present than most I've tried fo this style, and they are quite citrusy. Also, the malt in the background smells slightly raw and fresh, but still rich. There are definite notes of spice along with a very subtle alcohol scent. Outstanding smell from this beer.  Taste - First thing that hits your buds is definitely the strong flavor of spices and dark fruits (maybe over ripe, but excellent!). The spice flavors are very complex and quite powerful. Immediately next comes a very nice alcohol burn that lasts right up into the aftertaste, but it is not unpleasant at all. The hops flavor comes in at the finish, along with its malt partner. The hops are clean and citrusy, and the malt is rich yet fresh/""rawish"". Also in the aftertaste is a nice sweetness sensation, along with an earthy feel from the yeast.  Mouthfeel - Perfect. Perfect carbonation, it's medium bodied, it rolls around your mouth like smooth silk or velvet. It's heaven in a bottle.  Drinkability - To this beer's credit, while it has a very complex flavor and smell, and a decent alcohol burn, it is very, very easy to drink (at least for me). Of course, strong belgian-style ales are my favorite type of beer.  Overall, this is just another fine example of why Unibroue is one of the most quality brewies in the world. Their beers are just superb and this one lives up (or exceeds) to the rest of their line. A must have brew right here!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,haz77,4.27,"A - Pours a muddy chestnut brown with a foamy light tan head, which drops to a fingers worth after a minute and sits atop the body firmly. Large bubbles of carbonation rise along with some streamers.  S - Fruity esters, clove, banana, yeast, orange, pepper.  T - Surprisingly light for the style. Takes a while for the flavours to appear, with caramel arriving first, then fruity esters come through between the middle and end. Clove and bubblegum in the aftertaste along with a hint of the ABV.  M - Smooth, with a light-medium body. I normally prefer a heavier body for the style, but this was very nice indeed.  D - The lightness of the body, along with the well-masked alcohol make this brew very drinkable. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dutchbrew2,4.25,dark red color yet still able to see through it. tons of carbonation with a great head. lots of fruit aroma plum and cherry and some bannana. moderately malty and sweet on the palate with alot of fruit flavors. I couldnt taste any of the high alcohol content of this beer. 8% is not much for the style but even so theres not a trace of it. everything blends together in maudite to make a very complex smooth and easy to drink ale that i go back to since it is reasonbly priced for a belgian style ale. This is just another example of some of the fenominal ales produced by unibroue.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,scottoale,4.11,"From the big corked 750ml. brown bottle pours a fairly dark orange-mahogany ale with 1/2 inch of cream colored floamy head. The carbonation keeps the head aloft and while it laces somewhat, the lace on the glass slips back into the head.  Sweet and spicy malt nose with that musty yeast blending well with the fruityness. Not as aromatic as I remember it from previous encounters. The alcohol becomes noticable as it warms.  Sweet ripe fruity intro, pear, plum, fig, that eventually turns to the spicy yeast that Unibroue does so well. The spicyness turn to the musty and bitter side, while the alcohol winds it down with a warming, dry finish. Tasty stuff !  Full bodied with plenty of alcohol, the mouthfeel is smooth and velvety with a tang fron the spicy yeast. Very drinkable, but sip and enjoy it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,GolgiIPAratus,3.79,"Sampled: 7.9.06  Appearance is a honey bourbon brown beneath a small head that leaves little lacing if any at all thorugh the drinking. Despite its claimed style, Strong Dark Ale, its certainly not dark in the sense of La Terrible or Chambly Noire but the rich golden brown color is really nice.  Nose is typical Unibroue, yeasty funkiness. But beyond that I couldnt pick out too much by way of complexity or diversity. Failry weak and light.  Flavor also carries the typical Unibroue funkiness to it. This, accompanied with fruity sweetness and a tigne of bitterness make it a nice drinker. But it really doesnt stray far (or at all, really) from the Unibroue line of strong ales. But alone it is a nice beer. Sits light in the mouth for a darker beer and its medium carbonation is just right.  Its a sipper, high in ABV and works well as it warms slowly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,expatsteve,4.17,"Appearance: Impressive cloudy orange/copper brown. 1/2 inch head subsides quickly to thin lacing. Low/medium viscosity.  Aroma: Cantaloupe, golden syrup, ginger and caramel. Familiar Unibroue sourdough/yeast finish. Some raisin notes.  Taste: Bready yeast front palate, which gives way to apricots, raisins, and a little booze in the back palate. Peaches, caramel, and mild brown sugar developments. Slight vegetal end and an almost buttery finish/aftertaste. An impressive brew.  Mouthfeel: Light, fuzzy, with cleansing malt finish - all Unibroue.  Drinkability: A really solid drinkable ale. A little flat in comparison to Trois Pistoles, but good nonetheless.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,neenerzig,4.05,"Another wonderful offering from Unibroue. This beer pours a medium reddish/brown color that appears cloudy when held up to the light. Pours a very big and quite carbonated looking white head that quickly dissappates to about 2/3 of an inch before totally dissappearing 10 minutes later, leaving no lacing behind. Aromas of malt, citrus, some other fruits, and some spice are all quite evident. The taste is of sweet malt mixed with some citrus and a hint of roasted nuts. Not bad at all. Has a bit of a nutty and dry aftertaste. It has a very smooth yet crisp mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Pretty easy to drink as well.  Eric",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,EPICAC,4.3,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy reddish-brown, with a fluffy beige head with good retention and patchy lace.  Smell: Yeasty, with an orange cream aroma. There's a tart cherry fruitiness, with hints of spice and alcohol.  Taste: Tart citric fruitiness; toasty, bready maltiness. The finish is yeast with light bitterness and a lingering fruitiness.  Mouthfeel: Tingly carbonation, light-bodied, with a creamy texture.  Drinkability: Flavorful and very easy to drink, with well concealed alcohol.  Overall: A nice, easy to drink Belgian Strong Dark. The spiciness is less prominent than other beers of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BabaJohn,4.05,"Maudite pours a nice muddy, chocolate color with little head. Still, it just kept bubbling and frothing like a volcano or series of lava flows. Smelled hearty and slightly sour, almost of pickles. Lots of chocolates and caramels in the taste with a pleasing, alcoholic warmth and hints of those sour, bitter smells coming through in the taste. Mouthfeel has a carbonated bite. This is an excellent beer through and through. Way to go Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jhollick,4.8,"Presentation - 12. oz. bottle, served slightly chilled. La Maudite translates to ""The damned"". This should be fun.  Appearance - The beer pours a deep amber with lighter orange undertones. Joining this pretty color is the most beatiful head I have ever seen. My 23oz. chalice could scarcely contain this monstrous and fluffy white head. Bear in mind this was not an aggressive pour, and this head is the norm for this beer. Amazing just to look at it. The lacing remains throughout the beer.  Smell - The smell does not disappoint either. Candied malts and orange hits my nose initially, followed by clove, yeast, and some banana. I expected a darker smell based on the appearance. For my money, this is also one of the best smelling beers I have encountered.  Mouthfeel - The trademark Unibroue carbonation is present in this beer, which I find to be pleasing. The carbonation reminds me of champagne with its small and soft bubbles. That aside, the feel is a bit light and slightly astringent from the alcohol.  Taste - I have had many of the heavy hitters of the Belgian scene, and this is a beer that I keep coming back to. It is surprisingly playful and light for a strong dark Belgian. In fact, I might not even categorize it as one. The spice and clove leave an aftertaste that some have called unpleasant, but its all a matter of taste. I enjoy the aftertaste, and all of its subtleties as the beer melds from dry to slick and the tart, sweet, and spicy flavors wash over my mouth.  Drinkability - As drinkable as any 8% beer can be, although I wouldn't have more than one 750mL bottle in an evening. The alcohol is just one small part of the drinking experience here.  Overall - This is a top 2 or 3 beer from everything I have sampled thus far. This sticks out to me among the Unibroue lineup, which really says something about the beer. This is reasonably easy to find on the east coast, and I am very thankful for that. May I be damned to an eternity of drinking this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,pemulis,3.65,"i had very high hopes going in, and the look/smell did nothing to dissuade me. i found the mouthfeel to be surprisingly thin, and it left an unpleasant after-taste that i certainly was not expecting. i had this on my ""must try"" list, but it has moved to my ""had it - won't buy again"" list  next to la fin du monde on the shelf for the same price, i'm going for the end of the world every time",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,doppelmeup,4.5,"Poured a bottle into a tulip glass. I've had this a couple of months in the fridge.  Mammoth off-white pillowey head that rivals Duval in intensity and staying power. Lacing is not as good as I was expecting. Dark honey-amber color similar to maple syrup.  Distinctive Belgian yeast aroma. Some coriander, clove, allspice, but not overpowering. Sweet malts.  Delicious flavor. Similar to aroma, some hints of bubblegum, some alcoholic bitterness, fruity, sweet malt, very well balanced.  Smooth, not overly thick mouthfeel, especially given the high ABV. LIghtly carbonated. Warming on the way down.  Excellent brew from Unibroue. Very drinkable, and especially good with my dinner tonight, which is a spinach salad with grilled chicken, mandarin oranges, bleu cheese and Makoto Ginger dressing. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BeerRun13,4.05,"Pours a deep dark fiery orange. An off white head was too much at first, and I'm sure it wasn't the pour. Sugary sweet malt aroma. Clove aroma is abundant and nice. maybe a touch of a honey like smell as well. A touch of an orange citrus shows in the flavor. Bananas and cloves are pleasant. Lighter side of medium. Well carbonated, dry, and smooth. This one was highly recomended to me, and I have to pass it on... A very good beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,AmorousAngel,3.85,"Medium brown and cloudy with a fluffy, light tan head (about an inch) that dissipated fairly quickly.  Slightly sweet smell and taste. Noticeable malty tones, as well.  Highly carbonated, so not a very smooth feel, but not unpleasant.  Very tasty and complex, so I will probably buy this one again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bigdeuce,3.88,"This was my first belgian ale. Not sure if it is really a ""belgian strong dark ale"". I feel it is more of a ""dubbel"", especially if you look at the color compared with Trois Pistoles or Terrible. Color is a medium to dark brown, some brown sugar in there, maybe? Very esthery and fruity in the smell and taste, for that matter. Goes down smoothly and is wickedly strong, and undetectable. Good head, nice lacing. An attractive belgian to be enjoyed over and over, just not too many in one session.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Vancer,4.08,"Maudite for review number 400. Special beer for the occasion.  Poured, into a chalice of course, a clear oaken / bourbon color with a tan head  nicely ringing the ol glass. Turns hazy brown as the swirling kicks in towards the end of the bottle. Any brew bottle conditioned brew is extra special for me, like this one.  Earthy aromas first appear, followed by candied fruit and apples. Sweetish quaff of Belgium yeasts and sugar cane. Nothing really stands out, but the taste is solid.  Fizzy mouth, tangy and sweet on the tongue. Very dry and crisp. No alcohol presence at all, its very well hidden. A quality brew, but not a knockout by any means. Nice sipping brew for cool or warm weather.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,kbnooshay,4.5,"I had this last night at the Old Toad in Rochester. It was poured for me into a cool Maudite glass. This poured a gorgrous hazy as hell brown with a gigantic head that tapered as it grew because of the glass. The head did not go down for about 7 minutes which kinda pissed me off but gorgeous nonetheless! The aroma was huge on the malt and was incredibly fruity and yeasty. There was also a hint of caramel and clove. There was not much in terms of hoppage but thats allright as there was plenty of happy spice and yeast to keep it plenty interesting. Alcohol is simply not detectable, at 8%. There was also a yummy hint of banana. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated but not too much. The feel was slick and chewy. I could down a whole 4 pack of this with no problem. All of the Unibroue brews seem to share that quality. I am giving this the same score as Don De Dieu and Trois Pistoles because they are all so awesome, I am not finding a standout.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,denjen,4.07,"Dennis: I have always been amazed at the level of carbonation that Unibroue packs into their bottles without them exploding. Once opened the beer made a mad dash to escape it's bottle only to barely be captures in our glasses. 5 inches of foam later, we were ready to try this. The taste is typical Unibroue, with yeasty, sweet, spicy malts and insane (but enjoyable) carbonation. The taste is enjoyable, but I actually got a bit of alcohol bitter on the exhale...which personally I like. Of course at 8% it's no real surprise. If you like rich malts, and strong beer with some spices you'll be in heaven drinking a beer for the damned. Jen: Of the Unibroue's that I have had, this seems to be more unique than the others. The scent is of mild spices and citrus fruits. With first swallow, I get a blend of coriander and clove. I also get a nice blend of malts and very mild hops. The ending has a nice alcohol presence, but nothing that is overwhelming. And, as usual, the nice little bubbles seem to dance across my tongue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,kimcgolf,4.28,"Pours a copper color with a thin off-white head. Minimal lacing and the head did not last as long as I had expected (otherwise, this rates even higher). But now for the good part. Fruity aroma, most likely of grapes and plums. Very good taste, same fruits, mixed with a spicy flavor, possibly cinnamon. Great finish, as it left a long, pleasant taste and a warming sensation. This is a beer I think I can enjoy more in winter than on a summer day. No wonder its Canadian. Good work Unibroue!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jettjon,4.03,"Highs: Appearance, smell Lows: Weak flavor  Pours a beautiful mahogany color with minor suspended sediment and many very tiny bubbles (quite attractive). Head is two fingers of thick, creamy tan with good lacing and very good head retention. Great looking brew. Nose is strongly of the Unibroue signature wine yeast and dark fruit. Taste to me is more akin to a white ale than a strong dark. Its very light, even understated, almost water-like, with an apple-grape flavor and a slight hint of alcohol toward the middle. Yeast dominates the flavor, and it finishes on a light note, perhaps from the alcohol. Not as bold as I was expecting. Mouth is watery but crisp, with plenty of tiny bubbles to delight the tongue. Drinkability is pretty good. This is a smooth, (gasp) light, and crisp brew, but at 8%, take it easy. Still, its an enjoyable beer though a bit on the light side for me.  Overall: This is a Belgian strong dark? Could have fooled me. Its a beautiful, good smelling beer thats a little undewhelming for me. Try it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Dewey0603,3.86,"This beer pours an amber coppery color with a giant white foamy head leaving some nice lacing. A very good looking beer. The smell is fruity,citrus?, and very wine-like. You can also make out some candy sugar in there too. The taste has a dark fruit, burgandy, candy sugar flavor. For a high alcohol beer, there is almost no sign of the alcohol. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing OK, but this does have a slight metalic aftertaste. All in all, this is a very good beer. It may be alittle too fruity for me,but that's me. I would highly recommend it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,sinstaineddemon,3.2,"A - this ale pours a dark brown cola color, with a thin white head, tons of carbonation is visible  S - a crisp refreshing aroma, like unsweetened iced tea, seasoned with spice, like either clove or coriander, in addition in the background is a fruity dark sweetness like baked apples sans the cinnamon  T - spicier than i thought it would be, like a saison , hoppy bitters underneath, the sweetness is apparently solely in the aroma save for a faint vanilla hint  M - too fizzy and spicy for my taste, but smooth otherwise and palatable  D - the lacking in mouthfeel lowers the drinkability for me, but others who enjoy it will love it, its high quality and tasty",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,gbontrag,4.57,"Clear and clean amber pour, on the thinnish side. Gorgeous blooming froth, and levitating, chaotic beads of carbonation. This smells of new carbon paper, sweetish white wine, mandarin oranges... This is a really pretty sniff. Delicate and floral flaves leap out of the glass into my enjoyment like a dolphin surfacing. It's sleek, light, full flavored; wet marigolds, red peppercorn bite. I really feel like I'm munching my way through a mediterranean garden: This is dry, light, minerally, flowery, spicy. A little bit of sweet melon with black pepper. This is a really nice beer experience. Certainly broadens the menu. I love it! The yeasty backbone provides a papaya-like aura. The malts are truly a vehicle for the yeast here. This good girl not only prays at the church of fermentology, she also provides a wicked good time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Gagnonsux,3.66,"Maudite is a hazy, dark amber-red color. Head is thick, off-white, and very tall. Retention is very good. The appearance of this beer is almost perfect. Aroma is sweet and spicy, most reminiscent of cinnamon. All in all, a nice smell, but one-sided. The start of a sip is a combination is sweet cinnamon and peppery spice. A candi sugar sweetness enters the picture about mid-sip and helps regulate the pepperiness. Some citrissy fruitiness is in the mix as well. Finish is very abrupt. Overall, I found this enjoyable, but the flavor was a bit thin. Considering how high this beer is rated, I'm a bit disappointed. Anyway, I'll probably sample this again to make sure I'm not missing anything.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,atigerlife,4.18,"I have had this beer a couple of times before and I found it not as impressive as others from Unibroue and not a classic of the style. But, for reasons unkown, I found this latest bottle to be very nice. Figured it was time to write a review...  Poured a brownish/orange with a good sized light brown head that had decent lasting power. Light lacing. A lot of small carbonation can be seen rising.  Aroma of dark fruits and sweetness.  Taste was of dark fermented fruits, malts and some spices. The alcohol comes through with a light warming sensation. Nicely balanced.  Mouthfeel was quite smooth. Medium body with good cleansing. Quite nice.  Overall, a very nice beer. Very drinkable despite its 8% AV. A lot of character in a bottle. I guess I'll have another sometime soon.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,InsolublePancake,4.32,"My first Unibroue! I'm just starting to get into Belgian beers and figured I'd better try one from what seems to be one of the best Belgian style breweries in North America.  A- Deep copper with lots of cascading bubbles and a decent off-white head.  S- Spicy aromas with cloves and pepper. Lemony tartness with some banana thrown in there along with a bit of a metallic smell. Tons of complexities here, most of which I can't even begin to point out.  T- Great flavor, very complex, so much so that a more sophisticated palate than mine is needed to break it down. Esters abound, giving me all kinds of interesting fruit and spice flavors. Key lime pie and banana are a couple that stand out to me. Anyway, it's great. Finishes dry with just a touch of bitterness.  M- Very nice, medium bodied, not too thick, carbonation is just right.  D- Considering this is 8%, it is very good. Not a quaffer by any means, but definitely drinkable. I'd have another.  Very nice beer, and good first impression with Unibroue. I definitely look forward to trying their other offerings. Recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jwc215,4.33,"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours orange/brown with a large white, creamy, bubbly head that slowly settles to a spotted thick lace. The smell was of bready malt with a hint of various spices. The taste was of spices, including a touch of pepper - the alcohol was covered by complex flavors - including, but not limited to, orange peel, coriander, a dash of pepper, and a touch of caramel on a bready base. The various flavors intermingle to give it a unique, delicious flavor. The tastes thin out a bit in the mouth, leaving a dry, spicy, but yet refreshingly clean, feel. The alcohol is well-hidden until a warming feeling takes over afterwards. This brew is devilishly drinkable - or is that the devil that is on the foreboding label saying, ""Have more..."" ... Gladly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smell - fruity esters, bananas, caramel malts with hint of dark bread, plums, and dates.  Taste - exactly as smell indicates. Fruity esters and caramel malts. Dates, plums, raisins, dark breads, spicy sweet rolls, washed over by bananas and other fruity esters. Some alcohol warmth also rounds the finish, but it's not harsh.  Mouthfeel - halfway between full and thin- moderate. Also, moderate carbonation.  Drinkability - this is good, goes down well, 8% abv may intimidate some from having more than one serving ( 750 ml ) in a session.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

There is strong malt backbone that is accentuated with corriander fruity esters (banana and orange) and a peppery finish with some yeasty hints as well. There is also a alcohol warming effect. Feels great in the mouth, a little chewy, very carbinated. An extreamly drinkable beer, one that I can see myself buying on a regular basis.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,maundythirsty,3.8,"Cream-colored head starts strong, falls hard but leaves substantial sticky lacing. Beer is carmel-colored and a bit cloudy.  Smells like over-ripe fruit, oranges and bananas, and spicy corriander. Same for the taste, with a prominent alcohol bite and a nifty sour and peppery finish.  A little syrupy in the mouth, but stiff carbonation helps break that up. I love these Unibroue Belgian style beers for about two-thirds of a bottle, because they seem like such masterpieces.

A little caramel malt with a good estery smell like musk mellon. I think this is probably the best beer I have had from Unibroue. Has a nice complexity with caramel, esters, and some sort of spice. Maybe a little like nutmeg, it is perfectly balanced. A nice full bodied beer with great hint of alcohol and warmth but not overwhelming or that noticeable, just another level of complexity. Very enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Massive head, very active, carbonation is high.(bottle refermentation) Cloudy reddish/brown and copper color. small amount of lacing around the glass as I drink.  Grapefruit! with a hint of ""greens"" and caramel sweet smelling malts.  Taste has more of a mellow wheaty/hoppy balance than the aroma will lead you to believe. First hit has some sour notes(grapefruit-sour!) but mellows to a nice hearty finish.  Refermentation adds a nice quick, making it very crisp and refreshing. It just seems to get better as I drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Cloudy as expected, light brown in color.  Sweet wheat aromas with a strong spicy bouquet of anise and all spice.  Dryer than the smell indicates, full of alcohol warmth. Very high carbonation--perhaps the only negative. Nice body. This beer has perhaps the most pleasant and complex aftertaste: long lingering white pepper with the effervescence dancing on the tongue. The spiciness continues long after the swallow is complete.  This beer could make me a real fan of Belgian beers. It's more than just a full body or high alcohol. The analogy I have is listening to a symphony instead of a single great player...there's so much more here.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smell: Strong yeastiness in the nose, followed up by a sturdy malty aroma. Some alcohol reveals itself plainly. Dark currants, or dates as well.  Taste: Heavily roasted malts. Dark, crusty breads come to mind. The alcohol comes through with candor. Heavily spiced; nutmeg, corriander. The hops are distinguishable, albeit in an abstract bitterness. Some melon. Caramel.  Mouthfeel: Bitingly carbonated. Syrupy on the tongue, with a smooth finish. Activates the senses.  Drinkability: Somewhat filling, with a not altogether inviting flavor.

Big and pillowy at first and slowly receded to a nice light frothy covering. Smell: A typical Belgian aroma of pepper and yeast, but it seemed a little more mild than some of the others that I've had from Unibroue. Still very good with some lime hints and some flower aromas. Taste: Toasty malts, pepper, clove, yeast and a surprising mild grassy hop that hangs on at the end. Alcohol is hinting but understanding for 8%. Less fruit flavor than I expected, but also more balanced than I expected. Mouthfeel: Bubbly with a medium body. Drinkability: Easy to drink, maybe to easy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,jwff,3.95,"12 ounce poured into a Unibroue tulip. Pours out a light brown darkened with a bit of reddish-orange. White head resigns itself to a spotty thin layer on top. Smells of that Unibroue yeast which is along the lines of a pear sweetness with an almost powdery sugar air to it. Like most Unibroue beers the yeast takes center stage with other flavors rounding it out. This one has a light citrus throughout that becomes more apparant as it warms, like biting into a boozy pear. There is a little bit of alcohol warmth, but it seems to aid the taste and the mouthfeel. Nice carbonation throughout. This is a little too sweet for me to be an every day/multiple in a session beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CNeilP09,4.82,"if an angel from hell would drink, this would be his first choice. absolultely astonishing. seriously, you FEEL like a badass when drinking this beer. someone asks, ""hey whatcha got there?"" the only response needed, ""maudite."" and the fledgling drinkers turn away and mutter under their breath about how much of a hardass you are. seriously, this beer pours solid, smells solid, and drinks solid. almost a hallucinogenic balance of hops, malt, and magic. sweet coriander citrus, mouth watering malts, this beer is sweet and sour, easy and strong. the head lasts longer than you do in bed. the head from this beer continues to add a crisp funk from afar to the total drink, and the carbonation is like hitting a downturn in a roller coaster of adrenaline. i really don't even want to go into specifics on what this beer actually tasted like to me, mainly for the reason that i'd rather you try it on your own, and take your own perspective into it, without skewing your view with mine. it's a heavenly brew, yet hellish. you could drink yourself into oblivion on this thing. i'm sure many a tortured soul finish their hard day of lashing with this wonderful sip. GREAT BEER. PERIOD.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,IntriqKen,4.45,"Maudite....cursed...yet so beautiful and promising coming off of the tongue. pours a gorgeous cloudy deep amber with a very tall, thick craggy off white head that melts ever-so-slowly to a thick lacing. The nose is hit with rich candied fruits and mild citrus. So far perfect, I'm almost afraid to take my first sip expecting disappointment. I would be very content just inhaling the perfume from this beer. The tongue is met with sweet malts but immediately assalted with a sharp citrus hops bite (and I mean bite) that tingles and leaves the mouth with a drying sweet citrus I find very satisfying. I immediately want another sip...savor....swallow...savor...want another. Aftertaste is dry citrus...candied rinds...not cloying at all. Alcohol presence is felt as you swallow and enjoyed as you savor the effects of the last sip. Very enjoyable. I am not disappointed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,HoustonTX,4.05,"Poured from bottle into a Chimay glass.  A - Pours a rich brown color with a large, off white head.  S - Smell is citrusy, with oranges/lemons/grapefruit apparent.  T - Initial waves of citrusy tones, clove/spicy notes, followed by a sweeping hop bitterness that fades to a well balanced aftertaste.  M - Mid bodied, rather on the light side though. Carbonation is decent.  D - For 8%, it's quite light, but still fufilling, as it tastes wonderful and has quite impressive mouthfeel. Another great offering from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Erdinger2003,3.93,"The dark brown color is enticing and the head doesn't break from the thin head. The lacing is ok, it sticks to the side of the glass a little.  Smell has banana, dark fruit, and a slight plum with clove.  Taste is clovey with dark fruit and a little pepper. The fruit flavors have mellowed out. The body is very light.  Mouthfeel is a little bit carbonated and a little bit watery, but not off-putting.  I will look for a fresh bottle and hope to get more complexity and flavors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,scooter231,3.7,"Such a funny color, this one is. Sort of rusty, sort of ruby, sort of golden. Maybe raisin-colored? I don't know, it's odd. Looks thick, too, almost a honey-like consistency. A bit of a head that fizzles quickly, and a hint of lacing. Nose is quite malty and sweet, a light fruity peachy presence, and a good deal of spicy presence, mostly clove. It doesn't all fit together quite right, but it's interesting.  Taste was interesting as well, bready and spicy, reminds me a lot of La Fin with a weird tart, spicy twang. Yeasty. Mouthfeel is bubbley and chewy and full. It's not a bad-tasting brew, it's an interesting concoction, but it's not my favorite brew. Decent bang for your buck.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,sinistrsam,4.5,"Poured a lovely copper gold, with a deeper hue at the bottom fading into a light irridescent gold at the top. Fantasitc. Lots of sediment. Large white foamy head, lots of lacing adn great retention. Smell was extremely complex; yeasts, malts, sour and dark fruits citrus and caramel come together and become more obvious as it warms. The taste was of deep dark fruits, alcohol, yeasts, malt, vanilla and spice. So much going on here and so wonderfully blended its hard to even describe. Bubbly carbonation in the feel, but very smooth. Alcohol isn't as huge of a contributor although a warming definitely happens towards the end. The whole production is damn near perfect. I could sip these all day. A fantastic beer overall; excellent representation of the style and another slam dunk for Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,pbr85,4.22,"Poured out of a 355mL bottle into a large wine glass (didn't have anything else suitable) A: Pours a medium brown color with a large, frothy, off white head. S: Smell is fruity, notably oranges. Sweet malty dough lingers in the back. Lemon and grapefruit are hidden behind the orange. Very citrusy smell to this beer. T: Wow, certainly one of the most complex brews I've ever had. Let me try to disect it a little. Hints of the citrusy smells are on the tongue, mostly lemon, but the orange flavor remains. Sweet flavors are everywhere, sourdough malts, that yeast flavor that I still don't know how to describe. Interesting flavors. M: Medium bodied. I like thicker beers of this type, so this one feels slightly thin. Carbonation is good and tickles the tongue. D: Very nice. I could imagine eating some nice cheeses and sipping on this beer. Something that everyone should try, and something that I would love to have on hand. Give this to a wine drinker who doesn't think beer can rival wine in complexity.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bignick,4.2,"750ml corked bottle purchased at Trader Joe's in Brookline for $6.49. Poured into an Ommegang glass.  This is another good offering from Unibroue. It poures a hazy, brownish amber with a fluffy head. It has the classic Belgian yeasty, fruity scent. The taste is also pretty classic, although it has a nice depth to it. For 8%, it is pretty drinkable, and one of the better beers out there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,oelergud,3.85,"Corked and caged. Clear beautiful copper body with good carbonation. Light tan head of small to tiny bubbles, dissipates to a float that leaves little lace. Strong honey with some vanilla in the nose. Concentrated molasses. Intense sweetness. Attention-demaning strong spiced flavor with surprisingly little aftertaste of a subdued version of the initial flavor. Full yet light mouthfeel, decent coating and slick sensation. Good drinkability, watch the ABV though.  -Oelergud",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,waldowin,4.41,"Picked up on a whim at the local Fred Meyers when I was unable to find my Trois Pistoles. Man am I glad I grabbed this!  Pours a honey-amber color, crystal clear. Absolutely monstrous head on the pour. I managed to get about an ounce of beer and about 15oz of foam my first try. Foam is off-white, a mix of large and small bubbles. Very sticky, excellent lacing, reluctant to fade. Lots of visible carbonation.  Smell is of golden raisins, peaches, honey, and a hint of cloves. Oh man is this going to be good.  Taste is of honey, golden raisins, and a hint of rum, oranges, and clove. Amazingly blended, and unearthly smooth. Carbonation is plentiful, making this feel like silky cream as you swallow. The alcohol shows up at the very end, warming the throat. This is fantastic stuff!  Now if only it came in bottles smaller than 750ml! As amazing and smooth as it is, the alcohol really gets you. One bottle is an evening for me, but man what an evening.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,sevineyes,4.28,"Poured from a brown bottle with a flying canoe on the label.  A: Cloudy cinnamon. Poured with about a finger of fluffy head. Good lacing.  S: Candied cherries. Yeast. Some smoke. A hint of alcohol. Somethings bringing to mind an herbal presence that I can't quite put my finger on. As it progresses the smoke seems to become more noticeable. Develops more of a dry brown sugar aspect.  T: Wow that's nice. Candied fruits. Cherry. Pears in syrup. Hints of citrus. Rasins. Progresses to smoked hickory. Earthy. Some salt. Finishes with some pepper on the sides of the tongue and has some fleeting glimpses at sour touches. Aftertaste is mildly spicy and lingers without being overpowering.  M: Big bodied. Coating and creamy. Very smooth indeed. Hardly notice the carbonation. Ends with some dry touches, but not dry.  Overall: Not sure I can say enough on this one. I really enjoyed this beer. Just about everything I've had from Unibroue seems to be outstanding. The smell and flavor really harmonize in this beer. I think it's that synergy that make this stand out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Skidz,4.33,"Pours out pale gold and sits a murkey sienna in the glass with a massive foamy off-white head. Fades slowly to a thick skim with lacings coating every inch of the glass.  Smells of dusty raisins, prunes and pears. Caramel-infused malts carry musty yeast overtones and all is backed by light, clovery hops.  Tastes delicately fruity, pushing out apples, pears, dates and raisins. Malts dominate with some doughish yeast flavors. Finish brings in mild-moderate bitterness with mild grassy tones.  Crisp in the mouth with ultra-fine, moderate carbonation. Medium bodied and oh so easy to handle.  Fine and delicous drinking with lots of character. Definately improves with warmth and sitting time to let the carbonation settle out a bit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,supercolter,4.3,"Appearance- orangish brown- almost looks like a brown sunset. Lots and lots of foam. Very frothy- Smell- yes this was probably my favorite part of this beer. There was a smoking oat and sweet smell, with not a hint of alcohol. Taste- Decent taste, was not a huge fan on the first sip, but after 3-4 I gained an appreciation. My only complaint here is that there is a bit of a wheaty taste that hangs a bit long. Mouthfeel- one of the lighter feeling Belgian beers I've tasted, with a bit more froth Drinkability- goes down smooth",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,daliandragon,3.88,"I've always liked this label, with the birchbark canoe of fur trappers paddling like heck for the flames....cool stuff. At any rate, this Belgian dark pours medium dark and opaque into my goblet with mediocre white head. Yeast blasts hard from the nose and is accompanied mostly by alcohol. Also some fruity and spicy notes but less imaginative than I was hoping. Fruity, refreshing taste that rides the carbonation well and finishes with a malty, alcohol laced finish. Mouthfeel suffers from overcarbonation but holds up well otherwise. I need to change the temp on my fridge because this brew is definitely too cold and hurts for it. This is another solid soldier from Unibroue although I found the flavor less interesting than some of their other selections. Still, you could do a lot worse..",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,doubleipa,3.95,"Nice, big, frothy head. Looks good in the wide-mouth chalice. Great lacing and the heads lasts a long time. Like most strong dark ales there is a lot of yeast and dark fruit.

22,33,instrumentality,2.76,"I drank this one in a face-off with Gulden Draak. I ignorantly assumed they'd be more similar than they were. I found the Draak to be dramatically preferable to this one.  Color: Dark reddish-brown.  Odor: Not too intense. My sense of smell isn't that effective these days.  Taste: Slightly sweet, but the overpowering taste was smokiness.  If you're into the sensation of drinking liquid smoke, by all means, pursue this beer, but I didn't enjoy it much at all. It took some effort to down the contents of my goblet. The Gulden Draak was far more palatable.   UPDATE: It's come to my attention that I may be confusing ""smokiness"" with ""cloves."" I may be tasting cloves and thinking clove cigarettes. Either way, it's not a taste I enjoy, but I just don't want to mislead anyone.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Naes,4.03,"This beer pours out a very dark orange, almost brown. The head is a tall off-white frothy layer that makes you pour the beer a few times before you can get the whole thing into the glass. Retention and lacing are both excellent. The aroma is yeasty with a bit of spice and a strong dark fruit characteristic. The flavor is a fine balance of dark fruit yeast and a slight amount of hops. There is also a slight alcohol warming, though it is hidden well. The mouth feel is generously carbonated and medium in body.  This one is definitely worth a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,akorsak,4.12,"I am drinking this on tap (first ever Unibroue on draught!) at Frisco Burritos in Columbia, MD. The ale is cold.  Appearance: More ruby red than brown, the ale pours with a nice head of 2 fingers' length. The head dissapates but leaves a nice ring around the mouth of the cup.  Smell: The ale has a strong yeasty smell to it. Under that, I pick up some spices, maybe a bit of fruit even.  Taste: The ale has a deep dark taste to it. There is an undercurrent of fruits, maybe some dates or plums. The alcohol is not noticeable.  Mouthfeel: The ale poured with a surprising vigor. The bubbles are a little caustic on the tongue, but the spices and sugars in the ale smooth that out.  Drinkability: Another winner from Unibroue, this ale is very drinkable. The alcohol slowly warms without overpowering the taste of the ale. This ale is must-have on-tap, as the aroma and flavor are enhanced.

Nose is sweet, like smelling dried fruits. Taste is awash in spice mingled with fruit. Finish is bready.

22,33,TurdFurgison,4.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Chimay chalice. Deep orange color with 1 finger foam on top.  Smells yeasty, tastes malty and fruity and yeasty. Unibroue must use a similar yeast for this, Trois Pistoles, and Fin du Monde. They all have awesome flavor.  I've been addicted to this taste ever since I first tried it a couple years ago. It's my high-alcohol session beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,custardcb,3.88,Another find devil's brew. Poured a foggy and hazy light brown with shades of red and copper. The head was rather light and fizzy and settled into a light foam across the top of my pint glass.  The aroma is sweet and slighty malty with the yeast coming through strong.. Slightless bit of spice lingers in the nose. The taste is like warm cider and cinnamon. There is a little bitter and acidic twinge there but overall it is very drinkable and quiet nice.  Another find job from the mates at Unibroue,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,heyitsbyron,4.17,"Poured a bottle from a sample pack into a pint glass (oops).  Head was large, say 3+cm, despite not a particularly agressive poured. Color was very brown, sort of muted as opposed to shiny. It didn't lace particularly, but these things don't bother me. In one word: brown.  Smelled like caramel, but otherwise mildly sweet, fruity and yeasty. Nothing out of the ordinary.  Tasted a lot better. Very fine balance between fruit, malt, yeast, and hops. I was expecting either a dry or a sweet finish, but it was very neutral. Booze was very well hidden too.  Not as creamy as some, a little too bubbly, but it general it felt fine.  I would think this is more ""drinkable"" than other strong dark ales because it is so neutral. Obviously it's a bit....pricey...heavy....dark...to swill on a regular basis, but it wouldn't be an impossible task to throw back 4 in a night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,StrongandSmooth,4.77,"12 oz. bottle poured into a chalice...First thing I notice immediately is the smell. It just comes wafting out of the bottle. I take a whiff of it just to get the senses going. I poured into my glass and it poured just a beautiful dark color with a nice cream head. The deep color was really opaque with light no really coming through at all. I was amazed at how easy the first sip was to drink. You get the hints of sweet and peppery. It has a beautiful feel in the mouth. I really enjoyed just having it in there. It had a good coverage as well. You really don't taste the alcohol all that much in this brew, it really smooths and fades nicely towards the end. I could drink it everyday",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MaltyGoodness,4,12oz. bottle  Pours a medium amber color with a fluffy white head that maintains. Spotty lacing on the glass.  Aroma is very bready with a deep dark fruitiness blended in. There is also a distinct peppery aroma.  Taste is sweet with a malty and bready flavor upfront along with a rich dark fruitiness. There is a slight spicy peppery taste before it finishes sweet and bready.  Body is rich and creamy.  This is a formidable Belgian dark ale and quite dangerously easy to drink.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,fingolfin72,3.9,"I love this brewery's labels.  Pours cloudy mahogany with a tall, fine palomino head.  Toasty, cedary spicy alcohol nose  The palate is deep and rich- brown sugar, sherry, woodsy and toffee notes with a nutty creaminess that presents itself in the finish.  The carbonation is just a bit coarse, but not bad. This is a rich, satisfying beer, but the alcohol and carbonation make it just a tad rough around the edges.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,lpayette,3.9,"Appearance - pours a cloudy brownish color with amber highlights. The color isn't too appealing to me, but the head is huge and has great retention and I always like that. In short- Outstanding head, displeasing color.  Smells- Hard cider, light malts, and alcohol esters.  Tastes- Apples, a hint of caramel, sugary fruityness, and definitely fruity alcohol.  The mouthfeel I think is perfect for the style. Much better in that respect than other belgian strong ales I've had recently.  Drinkability is average for me. For some people this could be quaffed a lot easier though I'm sure. For me it's more a sipper.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MSchae1017,3.95,"This beer poured a copper color witha slightly off white head that holds and laces nicely. It smells of belgian yeast and subtle dark berry fruits. The taste is mainly fruity (plums and raisins) with a nice yeast flavor balanced wiht some bitterness so as not to be too sweet. It is nicely thick but a little over carbonated. Overall, a good belgian that I would drink again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Noxious26,3.75,"341ml bottle poured in a pint glass. From Collection 2006 a variety 12 pack from Unibroue.  Hazy, red-amber in colour. Huge beige head fills the top 1/4 of the glass. When I opened this bottle it actually foamed all over the place like a champagne bottle. Big gobs of sticky lace.  The first thing I notice in the aroma is the trademark Unibroue yeast characteristic. It's pleasant, but all the beers have this ""sameness"" to them that makes it a little ho-hum. Sweetness, dried fruit and cake... like a fruitcake or christmas cake background to the yeast.  Flavour is a little hard to pin down. There's alot going on at the same time and the complexities, I find, make it hard to define. Sweet malt at the start and a hint of alcohol. Background spices, yeast and dried fruit tease you. During the carbonation rush, the alcohol becomes more evident. Then the alcohol fades with the carbonation and reveals a spicy and yeasty dry finish. Lingering aftertaste is peppery with a bit of an alcohol bite.  Nice and mellow and smooth mouthfeel with little pin pricks of carbonation until the aftertaste. The aftertaste is a bit harsh with the pepper/alcohol combo.  Like most of the Unibroue products I've had, this is a sipping brew. There really isn't anything to make me want to have another sip right away, but when you do take one, it is very nice. Yes, it is good, but no, it's not really my style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,lordofthewiens,3.9,"This beer was an amber color with a thick white head that dissipated quickly. It had a fruity sweet odor, almost candy-like.

22,33,whynot44,4.23,"Slightly cloudy amber color with a huge ivory head that slowly settles down to just a moderate layer, leaving nice lacing all the way.

Very light sweetness with a definite alcohol warmth and a fruity, slightly metallic finish.  Smooth, medium/full bodied, very easy to drink. Nice Canadian version of a Belgian style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,goochpunch,3.88,"Pours a deep garnet with a thick, frothy, cream-colored head. Very active carbonation in the glass. Smells of granny smith apples and clove spice, almost like liquid apple pie. Flavors are very layered and at times hard to decipher through it all, but what I do pick out are flavors of apples, pears, cloves, yeast, and something that makes me think of grape flavored ""Mike & Ike"" candies in the finish. Mouthfeel is very light on the tongue and very ""airy."" A fantastic Unibroue offering, as always.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,WMBierguy,4.46,"The beer pours out a hazy reddish orange, and has a magnificent head that stays around for minutes and leaves lacing down the side of the glass.. Has a very clean taste. The beer is very strong, but the alcohol is subtle. It's stramge to consider, but this beer (with it's 8% ABV) is more drinkable than any light beer that I've had. This seems to be a great, relaxing beer, one that would go down smoothly after a day of hard work. Unibroue is a truly great brewery, in my opinion the best non-European brewery.

22,33,DaPeculierDane,4.5,"One of my very favorite non-Belgian Belgians. Murked copper caked in rich vanilla foam and chocolate sprinkles. Super spicy nose. Extremely complicated and well candied. Loaded with lemon, pepper, alcohol, toast, mint, chocolate, and plum candies. Tastes yeasty with very Belgianish malts. Carbonation is off the spectrum making this one loads of fun to drink. Acidic yet fluffy. Thats an accomplishment. Finish is yeasty, drying, and peppery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

One to take time with and enjoy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MuddyFeet,3.69,Thanks to Buckeyenation for this bottle. I always see it in the store but never get around to buying it. A very interesting take on the style--very fruity.  Poured a reddish brown in color. Very murky red. No real head except for a thin layer of scummy bubbles resting on top. Essentially flat in appearance. Nose is very fruity. Full of apples and pears. I was not expecting that at all. Left me scratching my head in surprise.  Flavor is very sweet with hardly much in the way of hops. Very sugary sweet with more of the same fruit I got in the nose. I can taste the alcohol from the bit of heat I get from the flavor. Overall it kind of makes me think of a port wine. Very vinuous and thick. Extremely undercarbonated. Interesting take on the style and I think it would make a nice end of the night beer.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Absumaster,3.59,"This is the first Canadian beer I ever had. Don't know if this is the best one to start with, as I feel it is pretty much a copy of any Belgian tripel. Amber, reddish coloured beer with very nice lacing foam. Smell was sweet, malty with ripe bananas and some vanilla. The taste wasn't what the smell promised, it was rather dry, adstringent. Still malt, dark fruits, vanilla were present. Low bitterness and lots of carbonation. It reminds me of Chimay white, but without the strong bitterness. All together a typical Belgian tripel, compliments for reverse engineering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Higravity,3.97,"Subtle can be a strength. Light brown color with tight bubble cream colored head. Smells of slight alcohol with raisin and malt sweetness. Taste is deceptive, at first it is light and not too intenese, then it turns up the volume. Giving more flavor with each sip and providing notes of dried plum sweetness and malt flavor and a belgium yeast phenols. Good body with nice carbonation and this is very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Appearance: Kind of a reddish brown. 1-finger head off of a hard pour which quickly dissolved into a thin, persistent lace.  Smell: Raisins, yeast and alcohol. The smell absolutely screams Belgian.  Taste: Incredibly rich and full-bodied. There are hints of banana, brown sugar, red grapes and pear. Alcohol makes its presence known, but leaves a pleasant, fruity aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Great carbonation makes this brew truly refreshing, despite the abv.  Drinkability: Exceedingly drinkable, but after more than a couple of these you'll be on the floor.

I can't quite distinguish an individual smell but has a citrousey, sweet spicyness going on that I really like. Reminds me of dark soft fruits at the almost rotten extreme ripe stage. Very well balanced taste. It is slighly sweet, just enough hop bitterness with a tingly carbonation zing that makes it all lmost perfet. The alcohol is well hidden within all this flavor. The mouthfeel is a little sticky but I'd rather it be this way than thin and watery. Very drinkable. If you love Belgian ales in this style you'll love this one at this price. Certainly not cheep but still affordable if you do one or two at a time. Try it!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,beerphilosopher,4.5,"Poured into a Westmalle chalice from a 750ml bottle as a striking red amber color with a solid white head that persists well. Nose is of sweet fruits and yeast, with some considerable spiciness there as well. Very festive aroma. Pleasing indeed. The flavor, again, is fruity ... maybe pear and sweet plums. Characteristic Unibroue yeast underpinnings. Excellently smooth and refined, this ale is medium to heavy in mouthfeel and has a terrific sweetness without being cloying in any way. Alcohol is well conceiled. Another fine ale from my Canadian friends ... I'm anxious to cellar a bottle and see what I have in a year or two. A fine Belgian dark. Pick up two bottles ... one to drink now and one to wait upon.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,danielharper,3.91,"Purchased from Strong Bros. Liquor, Fayetteville, TN.  (Notes taken on 2/11/06, while watching Mythbusters, if you must know. Review verbatim from notes.)  ""Dark brown pour, thick tan head. Foamy. HEavily yeast-accented aroma, strong sweet honey notes. Flavorful Belgian funk taste. Relaxing and decent, not too strong. Thick mouthfeel, pleasant to swirl. Very pleasant and flavorful. Drinkable.""",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jamesdergen,4.17,"Appearance: Pours a rich, caramelly amber color with a relatively small fizzy head that dies off relatively quickly.  Smell: Aromas of white grape juice mostly and some sweet grains.  Taste: Big dark fruit flavors, raisins and figs. Nice spicy notes in the background with faint hints of vanilla. Full and rich Belgian flavor.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly light-bodied but too carbonated for my taste.  Drinkability: Goes down easy, but the high carbonation detracts from the drinkability. The alcohol is very well-hidden. I could (and have) taken town an entire bottle on my own, but I prefer to split the bottle.  The first bottle of Maudite I ever had was probably the best beer I have ever had in my life. Pretty much every bottle of Maudite since then has been something of a disappointment. This one is probably the best I have had since the first. If you're into Belgians, you should have already tried it by now!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,skillerified,4.38,"An impressive dark red and brown colored beer with a huge head that's lasted a good ten minutes. Shots of beige come in at certain angles. Very hazy with both carbonation and lees. The carbonation is a little strange. The bubbles are very small and move upward very slowly. One of the most unique looking beers I've ever seen.  Fruit and spice on the nose. Smells quite tasty. The spicy side reminds me of mint, but just slightly different. The fruit side is a sweet red fruit scent. Not a specific one, but that's what comes to mind. On second, deeper sniff, I'm getting hints of clove and banana. Interesting. Not sure if there's a relation between this and Hefeweizen, but the scent is similar.  Sweet caramel starts the palate, but a mild malt flavor takes over half way through. The alcohol is fairly aggressive here. It gives the beer a backbone through the early sweetness and leaves a slight burn on the tongue at the finish. Nice. There's a touch of dark red fruit in there too. Really nice actually. Get's a little black peppery as it warms. A little too much for my taste, but it certainly doesn't ruin it.  Medium bodied and smooth. The carbonation and alcohol really do a number on the tongue. It's not a bad thing at all, but unique. Some might find it too aggressive.  This is hitting me a little harder than I expected for 8% ABV. That's going to hurt the drinkability. The aggressive mouthfeel lowers it a little too. I like it, but I also don't think I'd want more than maybe two of them. Three tops. Overall, another excellent Unibroue offering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jakester,4.2,"I got this 12 oz. bottle as a single at Union Jack's on the Manatawny. I drank it in a goblet. Best Before date of 05-31-07 on the label!  Pours a cloudy (if you pour in the yeast, which I did), dark amber/orange with a two finger head of beige colored foam. The head falls to a good coating and a ring, with minimal lacing. Carbonation appears high. These aromas linger for the duration of the drink.  Aroma is caramel, yeast, spices like pepper, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Also fruits like dark cherries, raisins, and dates. Smells ""Belgiany"".  Flavor is wonderful caramel candy, spices like above, yeast, cherries, plums, and dates. Residual sugar is medium. Hop character is very low, with only a hint of bittering. Aftertaste is a lingering caramel sweetness and a Belgian funkiness.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a high level of carbonation. A slight oiliness comes across the tongue, which gets quickly erased by the carbonation. Finish is tingly.  This is very good. Kind of reminds me of an Abbey Double in a way. It has nice malt character, it's spicy, fruity, yeasty, and Belgiany. I'd drink one of these anytime.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ndolover,4.02,-Nice looking bottle -When poured this lovely beer the head formed a whipped egg white consistency. Which ended up clinging to the glass nicely. -I found the smell yeasty with hints of figs and cheese -A wonderful tingle of tiny bubbles on the tongue showed off the yeasty yet amber malt flavor -It was a bit thin and the taste did not linger long -Definately a beer to drink with cheese bread as it could be a mini session beer.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Mebuzzard,4.6,"Poured into pint glass. Very nice pour. Good size head with a nice 'fluffiness' to it. Stuck to the edge. A dark yellow/orange body, hazy some sediment. A good aroma of fruit, spice, and herbs, some yeast and nut. Taste had a hint of ginger, some pear, lemon? and corriander. A lot of mixes. Vanilla a bit, some biscuit. A good feeling going down, crisp yet sticky,. not much aftertaste, leaves you wanting more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,WanderingFool,4.22,Maudite pours a cloudy brown color with some orange highlights around the edges. A frothy white head dissolves slowly leaving behind a fair amount of lace on the glass. A spicy aroma with a blend of allspice and cinnamon mixed with some apples greets you before your first sip. The scent almost reminds me of an apple pie.  Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is smooth on the palate. The flavor starts slightly fruity with an apple flavor. Soon the spices kick in offering a mild corriander and cinnamon taste. It finishes with a bit of alcohol bitterness leaving some spicy flavors behind.  I really like the balance between the fruityness and spices. This is a good sipping beer that tends to be filling.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Hautacam,4.7,"Slightly cloudy deep gold with light tan head..reduces to collar in a Leffe chalice. Smells great..clovey, yeasty, some alcolhol and malt. Tastes fantastic..this has got a lot going on. Fruits...apple, pear... a medium yeasty- clove- vanilla flavor with some hops and malt coming through....nice semi dry finish. This is a great complex mixture of everything I love about Belgian ales! ....in all the right proportions..amazing flavor. Mouthfeel is medium. Pretty drinkable....although, my girlfriend keeps reaching for the bottle...I might have to be happy with a glass and a half for now. If you love Belgians...you have to have this ale. I'll be buying this one again....probably tomorrow.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jp32,3.94,"Pours a dusty auburn shade with a fluffy cream colored head that dissipates quickly.  The aroma is of banana nut bread and way-over-ripe fruits like plums, grapefruit, and apples. I'm not fond of the odor, unimpressive. Reminds me too much of spoiled fruits.  The taste has an excellent and unexpected citrus zing to it. Grapefruit, lemons, lime, and oranges. I really notice a lot of grapefruit in this one, not to be mistaken for the grapefruit flavor I notice in a lot of pale ales and ipa's, this taste is quite different. Very enjoyable. A little malty underneath, and void of a lingering aftertaste. Its very faint, but after a while I notice some sort of metallic taste... copper or pennies or something. Kind of odd, or maybe my taste buds are just playing tricks on me.  The mouthfeel is good. It could be a little bigger, medium-bodied I'd call it. Drinkability is good as well, I could probably drink this all night long if it werent so damn expensive. A very good beer here, a must try if you havent already.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,rodrot,4.25,"This beer poured a murky reddish/brown color with a 1 inch fluffy head that took awhile to dissipate. Aroma was of sweet fruit, hops and spices. The taste was exquisite- spicy(cloves?), flavors of ripe fruits, rum-soaked chocolate covered cherries, cinammon and brown sugar. As the beer warmed in my Duvel glass, the spices and cherry notes became more pronounced. The beer finishes sweet and malty. I could drink this stuff all night if it weren't for the 8% abv. I purchased this bottle 2 years ago and it has not lost a bit of it's character. In fact, it tasted fresh. BTW, I've seen some publications refer to this beer as a barleywine, which is ridiculous. This is as Belgian as they come.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Bcant,4.12,"Poured from a 12oz foil caped bottle into a large snifter, Moudite is a deep red/orange/brown color that is similar to cordovan leather. A large dense white head settles to leave a sold of foam witch leaves good lacing.  The aroma is very dense and humid. Raisins, currents and plumbs are all featured in spicy medicinal wafts.  The savory fruit flavors start strong; give way to a sweeter middle and a slightly alcoholic finish. There is defiantly a lot going on in this beer but the flavors are balanced artfully and only begin to separate at the very end.  Very round and covering on the palate. Tiny bubbles give a velvety texture and give just enough space for the taste buds to do their job. A touch sticky at the end and this sensation lingers beyond the swallow. Still, a very nice brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheEclecticGent,4.3,"Served in a Unibroue snifter glass at Twains in Decatur, GA. This beer pours a light copper-red with a decent sudsy white head (1 inch). Impressive lacing that repeatedly rings the entire glass as I drink. It has a spicy and sweet aroma with hints of fall foliage. The taste is yeasty, spicy, and earthy. Has a honey-link feel to the taste, very nice. It has a bit of a warming quality. If it wasnt a high-gravity Id be slamming this brew. Another hit from Unibroue!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ski271,4.35,"Pours a hazy medium copper with a small, off-white head that turns a little chunky as it slowly diminishes. Lots of sticky lacing. The smell is of nice moderate malts with some spicy yeast. Caramel, and some light fruit, mostly apple. The taste is well nothing very out of the ordinary for the style. But its just done really freaking well! Wonderful balance. Some light hops which are quickly pushed aside by malts that are very deep in character and bring a nice caramel sweetness that isnt cloying. It has a medium body and a velvety smooth texture. Quite a wonderful beer. I don't think I'd mind hell too much if this 'damned' beer was served there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Blakaeris,4.03,"Pours chestnut brown with a huge creamy tan head. Looks like a rootbeer float.  Smell is yeasty, hint of orange with the spiciness of pepper and ginger. Slight alcohol notes.  Taste is similiar to the nose with the addition of sweet malt up front and slight hoppiness in the finish. Mild fruitiness gives this beer depth. Very nice balance. Spices really make an impact in this brew.  Mouthfeel is good, but slightly over carbonated for my taste.  This is a recommended and enjoyable brew. Unibroue is an amazing brewery. They haven't made a beer that I don't like.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,garymuchow,3.83,"Well this is my second go around with Maudite. My first attempt was bottled during the time the brewery was having bottling issues and the beer poured flat and of poor flavor. I chose not to review it. This sample is from a 4-pack of 12 oz. bottles labeled ""best before 3-17-08."" Aroma is a mx of light fruit, heavier malt with a very light cooked (not quite roast), sweet, yeasty, spicy and a slight alcohol. Dark amber, basically clear until bottom of bottle is poured. Very big head that's off-white that settles to a creamy steady presence. Some lacing. Flavor has a nice spice, yeasty, fruity blending with a gradually building malt character (with that cooked quality). Mild alcohol. Feel is full of fizziness from carbonation that's relatively soft (without bite). Thinner feel, but not too much. Overall my trials of this beer have lacked a fullness of flavor that has any endurance. Maybe it's a product of this style, but the flavors don't build over time, I find they become less present as the bottom of the glass approaches. I love the intial tastes and smells of this beer (style?) but the intensity doesn't last.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Oxymoron,4.27,"Poured a 750mL with a 2004 stamp on the bottle. Pours a mostly cloudy burnt brown color with some lighter tan hues throughout the glass. A decent head that poured but did dissipate around the edges. Ok lacing.  The smell is Belgium-esk with a certain spiciness to it. Good complex malt that is a little sweet. Some lighter notes of honey and candi or brown sugar. Some fruity notes as well, such as apple and pears.  The taste is sweet and very Unibroue like. Some sweet malt that mixes well with the candi taste. Very smooth and easy to drink. Quickly a spiciness that is like a apple cinnamon follows the sweet taste. Some spiciness follows like coriander and a touch of warmth. It finishes back with a sweet overtone for a smooth and enjoyable taste.  The body is good and easy to drink. Maybe a light soapy taste that stays in your mouth but so easy to drink. A nice beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,geetlord,4.23,"This beer poured a golden brown clouded with yeast. The head was foamy and beige but short lived. The aroma was spicy and hoppy.

Nose is a very doughy malt infused with dark fruit, brown sugar, some peppery spice, and a definite alcohol note. Taste is rich, dark and complex, a wonderful bready malt with tons of fruity notes, ranging from pineapple to plum to banana, all overlaid with a spicy yeastiness. Medium bodied with a nice fine carbonation, this has a nice smooth effervescent feel. This is a damn fine beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Wonderfully rich in the mouth, coats the inside of your mouth with a sweet alcohol warmth. I enjoy Maudite everytime!. Such a well done beer, alcohol seems a little too forward at times , so 1 or 2 is usually plenty, but its a very enjoyable 1 or 2 beers.

Lots and lots of alcohol in the nose. Smells acidic and yeasty, but mostly alcoholic - rum, gin, whiskey combined. This makes me a bit leary of my first sip, which I find to be...  Hmm... kind of like apple cider that's taken a turn. The flavor is a bit better than the nose; It has some definite crabapple notes, some spice and caramel, but the alcohol is a big hitter here, too. It's not exactly being disguised.  Mouthfeel is thin despite the head, very little carbonation; There's a quick, tight sensation as you swallow, then almost no aftertaste or lingering sensations except an astringent alcohol burn.  Unfortunately, this beer just didn't do it for me. I found it to be unpleasantly harsh.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,Citadel82,4.3,"This is an exceptional beer, I have fond memories of enjoying Unibroue's beers dating back over a decade. This delightful brew is a readily available treat for the palate. Tonight I am enjoying a chilled Maudite after ""Friday at the movies"" (Madagascar) with my three children tucked in and sleeping and my lovely,( yet still snoozing on the sofa) wife. Pours a hazy amber with a generous off-white head that fades slowly leaving glorious lacing and an nice persistent cap on a pleasant hazy amber brew. Aroma is rich earthy malts with a hint of pine. Taste is pleasant with biscuity malt up front, fruity ale yeast in the middle and a a dry light hop finish.

22,33,Beersignal,4.22,"This is a perennial favourite of mine from Unibroue that I have enjoyed for a decade or more but never given it much more of my time for a more in-depth read.  Pours a hazy dark caramel hue with orange tinged highlights that sparkle gently when held to incandescent light. A tenacious cap of light tan foam garnishes the top of the beer and lingers for a good spell.  Aromas are trademark Unibroue with a spicy/yeasty complex of fruitiness and maltiness that dominates the nostrils beginning, middle and end. This caroussel of aromas keeps revolving... sometimes issuing honeyed notes, then a touch of coriander, then a leafy and earthy pepperiness. It seems as if there was no finish to the aromas, something just keeps rising out into the nose. Great stuff.  The flavours are a compact blend of bready maltiness and candied fruit that is helped along by a tight medium dry mouthfeel. A mild alcohol bitterness balances the sweetness of the malt but is rivaled by crisp notes of pine gum that trickle out in the finish. Develops well and is very interesting.  This is much more drinkable than what the alcohol content would lead to believe. With its medium dry texture and balanced flavour profile that is not overbearing, Maudite is quite capable of rivaling Duvel in quality and drinkability.  Santé",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Carbonation swirls after each sip and reforms the head, very nice looking beer. Smells like all good belgians, fruity with yeasty notes but this one also possessed some unusual earthy woody notes as well which make it especially appetizing. Taste is huge and bold with floral yeasty notes up front and followed by a darker more malty finish. Full of complex suggestions of spices, in a way reminding me of a belgian style american winter warmer, if that makes any sense.

Fortunately, the one beer that unibroue makes is mighty tastey. Maudite reminds me a lot of Edition 2004/5, like the others it hides the alcohol well, has a nice head and enjoyable aroma. It also has that unibroue yeast flavour. Again, I'm not a huge fan of those particular flavours, they clearly don't get in the way of me enjoying the beer. Maudite is a 'solid' beer. It's not so complex that it's intimidating, but the flavours that are present blend well together to form a pleasant melange. I'd buy it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Cwrw,4.12,"From the 750ml bottle...amazing picture-label as always. The cage over the cork says this is the 2005 edition. This is one of those Unibroue beers I drink all the time, and yet I had never reviewed it. Maudite pours into my chalice glass smoothly, creating a puffy but fizzy and large-bubbled head. Why is it I can never get a good, creamy head from any of the Unibroue beers anymore? They all seem way too fizzy, and then they recede to a very thin covering...my glass is clean, etc, etc. The head is a bone-white colour. Big webs of lacing. The beer's colour is wonderful: a light chestnut, reddish honey hue. I love Maudite's spicy/sweet aroma. The aroma also possesses tree bark, or even oak. A solvent pungency lurks in the background. Big wafts of perfume, of yeast, red licorice, vanilla wafer, and roasted malts. The alcohol is really quite hard to find at all in the smell. In closer the beer exudes a very strong meaty smell, like roasted beef. Other aromas: light honey, cereal cream, nutmeg, chestnuts, cinnamon, caramel, and bitter chocolate/mocha coffee. The hops are quite strong when the beer warms more, coming through as hemp or marijuana. There exist also some aromas quite hard to define, which keeps me smelling the beer throughout the bottle. Complex. A fine smelling Belgian dark. The earthy tree bark exists for me in the taste too. Up front the beer gives spicy warmth, light hopping, and some meaty malts. The middle adds the honey-like sweetness, and the finish is all about the malts and a certain dry graininess. Not quite as fulfilling as the aroma, but nice. The floweriness comes through in the taste, as does a metallic nuance. Pairing it with 2-year aged cheddar mellows the spiciness and the bitterness, and really enhances the malts nicely. Also paired it with Danish havarti, but the beer was a little overpowering for it--it was still good though. The mouthfeel is not quite as thick as I should like--this is more medium-bodied. A warming beer, and with little astringency of alcohol, Maudite is very drinkable. Another feather in the cap of Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Appearance: Pours orange brown with a 2-3 finger head and LOTS of carbonation; nice, what you want in a Belgian. The beer is too cloudy to see through but lets the light pass through. Nice appearance.  Smell: The smell is sweet and malty. Significant amount of citrus, fruity esters & spices.  Taste: The taste is very unique, very colorful and bold. The taste had a nice sweet malt flavor to it, but then it went south for me. It got tangy; and much more tart than I expected from a Dark Belgian. Somewhat like an orange drink or fruity wine cooler that make you pucker on the aftertaste. It was certainly not an unpleasant taste, just not the taste I was expecting or that I prefer. There are a ton of reviews praising this beer so it may be just me but I think this may be a love it or hate it taste. It is CERTAINLY not average; and I respect it, but I prefer a darker thicker taste, less 'bouncy' flavors. In truth when I added to the experience, a cheese snack I actually enjoyed the beer as long as the cheese was on my palate to reduce the tartness. I do feel I should rate it though on my first impressions.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel was very light and thin, somewhat like soapy water. (not saying that is a bad thing, if that is what you like, just a close analogy to the mouthfeel). Very carbonated and bubbly feeling on you tongue.  Drinkability: While the flavors and mouthfeel were not my favorite; still this beer went down with great ease; its very smooth. Because it is so light it drinks like a glass of water when youre thirsty. If you like the Belgian mouthfeel and fruit beers with a tart kick, give this a try. If you are expecting 'Ommegang' or Tröegs Mad Elf (some of my FAVORITES) you may be disappointed.  --- EDIT I have since discovered that this beer is also available in 12oz bottles. I enjoyed it a little bit better this time around but not quite enough to actually change my previous review; thus the edit. ---  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Lacing is nice spider webs on the glass.  Smell: This beer smells really good. The smells start fruity sweetness. Then the smells move towards a woody peppery spicyness.  Taste: This beer leads with sweet fruity goodness. The sweetness gives way to spicy peppery splashes. Then the taste leans toward a tart fruityness and spicy again.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a full bodied beer that is nicely carbonated. I cannot tell the prescence of the alcohol in the taste or the smell of the beer. Watch out 8% and just marvelous to drink.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,GreenWBush,3.98,"Maudite has appeared in quantity in my town. There are at least two places locally where you can get this on-tap...rather impressive. I have yet to try this from tap, but have had many bottle samplings. About time for a review.  Maudite pours out of the bottle a leathered bronze, with a dollop of meringuing lasting head. A geographical map of lace networking appears quickly on the sides of the glass. Mysterious and intriguing.  The nose is dry, and filled with strong aromatics. Complex, and somewhat difficult to describe. Cloves, bergamot, candi sugar, cracked wheat, gumballs.  Initially tart, brisk, and dry on the palate, leading to a gorgeously lush malt flavor. And I mean *malty*, a weighty feeling that appears stronger than many true Belgian SDA's. Slight peak of cloying cotton candy/nutrisweet takes over in the last 3/4ths of the taste. Corn becomes apparent at warmer temperatures. Interesting endorphin-bomb flavor suggesting the first nibbles of fine dark chocolate.  A tasty BSDA that really hits the spot for this style. I'm looking forward to trying it on draft.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,OStrungT,4.2,"This beer pours a carmel orange color with a thin white head. The head fades quickly leaving few laces. It has a slightly spicy, malty aroma. It has a decent hop aroma to it as well. I can detect a slight alcohol aroma also. This beer has a flavor very much like the aroma. It is slightly spicy. It has a caramel like malty taste. I can detect a subtle hop flavor. The alcohol is not very noticable in the flavor. It has a very slight bubble gum flavor to it. Only just a little though. This beer is highly carbonated. It goes down smooth leaving a spicy aftertaste. I think this beer would make a good session beer. The alcohol content is a little bit high, but it is easy to drink, and it tastes great.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,paterlodie,4.1,"BB 1-12-08. Nice presentation with white head and dark golden/amber beercollor and quiet hazy. Nose is very much koreander, some hops, (caramellic)maltyness and some candysugar. Overall very fresh impression that's followed by good taste also. Taste is also candysweet and has a fruity/whitewine like taste with it. Further again candysugar and koreander that's majorly there again. Not overdone but nice and clean bitterness with it and showing good brewerskills. Fine mouthfeel also except the IMO overdone spicyness of the koreander. For the rest a great brew though that's quiet impressive to me. Nice alcoholic touch and good carbonisation with it make it very easy drinkable though and one I really like to see again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

In the mouth, I find it sweet and yeasty, with breadlike malt, Belgian candy sugar, good earthiness to it too. Drinkability is hurt, for me, by being a little too sweet.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,stodbrew,4.25,"Poured a deep slightly hazy red, almost brown, color. Head dissipates quickly.  Aroma is mostly malt with a slight phenolic hint.  Flavor is more malt and a bit of spiciness.

22,33,kgotcher,4.32,"POPED the cork on this one. Usually corked beers are less than enthusiastic when uncorked. This one let go a loud POP!  Murky carmel color beer with light frothy head that goes away and leaves little lacing. Aoma is powerful begium yeast with lots of sweetness and clove. Mouthfeel is slick and alchoholic. Warming is noticable as this one goes down. Still it is very smooth and easy to drink.  Taste has a slight hoppy bitterness but lots of fruity belgium yeast flavor take over in the end. Some spicy pepper flavor is noticable.  This is another great Unibroue beer. I don't know if they make a bad beer. . . If you like their style, Belgium foundations with a dose of North American style. Works for me. . .",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Golden2wenty1,4.58,"Picked up a single at Riley's here in Madison.  Pours a muddy, murky amber/brown with a tall, fine khaki head. Nose is yeasty, intensely fruity, with some burnt sugar/caramel notes. Taste is an explosion of intense, complex, overripe dark fruits, caramel, toffee, and a hint of chocolate over a yeasty, grainy malt backbone. Unibroue manages to pack all of this elusive fruitiness into one tightly packed, refined little package. Mouthfeel is champagne smooth and dry. Insanely drinkable for 8%. I think I have to give Trois Pistoles the edge as far as their BSDAs go, but this remains an incredibly tasty beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,crwills,4.23,"Well, with this many reviews already, I probably can't say much about this beer that hasn't already been said. But I will anyway. Ha!  Poured from a standard 330mL bottle into a pint glass. A deep, cloudy golden brown with a thick eggshell head, which faded quickly for me and left the glass clear.  Maudite smells like -- Unibroue. Hard to describe, but practically everything from this brewery (except for the cheap lagers) has a distinct scent that's tough to identify. In addition to Unibrouyness, Maudite contains elements of hay, hops, sugarcane, citrus (grapefruit I think), and just a hint of cocoa.  Taste is initially fairly bitter, and then develops some warming malty alcohol heat. Grasses and hay are prevalent, along with some apples, sourish grapes, and pungent spices. Mouthfeel is pleasant and smooth, and the aftertaste is quite fruity and actually pleasant all through the pint.  A very good beer. I've got a line up of additional Unibroues waiting to try, so we'll see how it stacks up (so far, style aside, I like it better than Raftman and U but not as well as Fin du Monde or Blanche de Chambly).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Taste: Slight dried fruit notes raisens,apricots and peppery and a fair amount of hop bitterness. With a very crisp mouthfeel and as for drinkability it packs a punch yet very drinkable.  Notes: Maudite is one very unique beers that I have ever had and very complex in it's flavors. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bighoppymonster,4.43,"Pours a glowing amber with a thick, foamy offwhite head as this style should. The head quickly settles, however, with active carbonation running rampant. A very sharp aroma with fruitiness, alcohol, and a bit of hops detected, giving it a very pleasent, inviting smell. The smell almost reminds me of cider. Extremely complex in taste. I almost did not know where to being with this one. Starts off malty sweet and nicely envelopes the mouth. The maltiness is then replaces by some spicy sharpness. A little hop flavour as well to keep things in check. Overall one hell of a Belgian. If I didnt know any better I would say this definately came from the Continent. My second brew from Unibroue, and I must say that I have been deeply impressed to both. A damn fine ale!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,cracker,4.42,"This is truly an amazing beer. Pours a an amber orange with a nice lazy head which slowly subsides. Smells of raisins and plums with an alcoholic twist. Oh what a lovely smell. Taste is first refreshingly dry with a subtle phenolic presence but yet somehow balanced with a slight but certainly not dominant sweet, caramel punch. Complex, complex and taste profiles seem to change by the minute as the glass warms. Surpisingly not to alcoholic in taste.  Not sure if it's truly a belgian strong dark ale, probaby more of a strong red ale. But what the heck, it's a damn fine beer from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,andjusticeforale,4.4,"Ive had this beer several times, on tap, in bottles, and even the homebrewed version at Maltose Express in Monroe CT(which was quite good in fact) but I thought I would memorialize my thought and try to pin down my true opinion... This poured to a clear brown rust gold into a modified chalice. There was a smattering of head which pooled up on the top and formed small isolated circles of greater density. There are typical Belgian aromas of yeast and malt, but no fruit, or at least nothing fruity or overtly spicy.  The name La Maudite means the Damned as noted on the bottle. I couldnt help thinking of the Duvel clones and genre, and the abv here was 8%. I though this as I sipped and there was a distinct sweet crisp bitterness which reminded me of Duvel. In fact, there are many characteristics which leads me to categorize it as a Strong Pale ale rather than Strong Dark ale. The lagery crispness, the clarity. Obviously the color is darker, and there is a residual finish to this which suggests a darker malt and yeast structure.  The finish is such that you dont get too much alcohol but enough to know what you are drinking, and although you dont get the feel that you have tapped a Belgian cask on an estate outside Brussels, you do get a nice Belgian-esque lingering.  For an 8% ale, the drinkability is super-high. This is a beer to cook with, pair with food, or drink alone, and savor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,fromage,4.03,"On tap at the Saucer for their Halloween celebration. Served in a special snifter. Haven't tried this one before--tap or bottle. Surprisingly good, complex, and drinkable. Had with some chocolate mud cake, which I thought paired pretty well.  Dark mahogany color, darker towards the top. Tan head with largish bubbles, quickly faded to lacing, which soon disappeared. Not much bubbling action going on. Served way too cold, but I did what I could to warm it up.  Smell was typically belgian. Spicy corriander, a little citrusy sweetness. A bit of grass. I didn't detect much else.  Taste was surprising--very fruity--cherries, oranges. Some cough syrup at first. Some oatmeal and cinnamon raison bread. As it warmed up I noticed a bit of ethanol.  Mouthfeel was weak at first, probably due to the cold temperature. Became more full as it warmed. Aftertaste still spicy, alternating with fruit.  Good drinkability. Alcohol content surely disguised for the most part.  Is it evil? I'm not sure, but I'll definitely come back for seconds.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jaluria,4.23,"I had this on-tap at The Brickskellar in DC. The beer is a burgundy color with minimal cream-colored head. Not much lacing or retention to the head, but it still looks elegant in a goblet. The aromas I detect are of: plums, prunes, cherries, and a touch of cocoa. Very unique and interesting. The taste is a combination of dried fruit with a slight caramel aftertaste and alcohol warming sensation. The taste is not overpowering but definitely an acquired taste especially since the alcohol makes itself known up-front. The drinkability is good especially considering the ABV and the the aftertaste is tarty but not biting or unpleasent. Overall, I enjoyed this beer and would have it again. A very good representation of this particular Belgian style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The aroma was fruity with a strong bready aroma. The aroma was citrusy and and sweet with a raisin and other dark fruit character. For some reason the aroma struck me as that of bread pudding with raisins.  The flavor was nicely crisp with a citrus flavor coupled with dark fruits which were not overdone. The flavor was bready with a light bit of earthiness in the hop bittering, but mostly a light caramel and light spice.  The finish was dry with a light crisp and low citrusy flavor into the afteraste with a light Belgian yeast spice. The body was medium and the carbonation was high.

22,33,SaCkErZ9,3,"Poured from 12 oz bottle with freshness date of 05/05/08.  An extremely large, light head formed immediately, causing a two stage pour. This two stage pour may have arisen yeast from the bottom of the bottle. The head was reduced to 1/4 inch and lasted for quite awhile. Bronze in color and completely murky. Nice, tiny bubbles are present which indicates a light, fluffiness in the beer.  Mostly yeast in the aroma, possibly due to the pour. Slight fruit in the smell. Smelled alot like a hefe.  Again, mostly yeast in the taste. Alcohol is noticeable as well, but is not overpowering. Fairly malty with a slight hop bite. Quite pleasant tasting. Light and refreshing.  Bubbly mouthfeel reminiscent of a summertime brew. Nice drinkability.  I gave all 3s on this because I wasnt sure if yeast is a common characteristic with this particular beer or style. Due to an inefficient or aggresive pour maybe,? I gave average ranks. I will reevaluate this beer at a later date; hopefully with a more effective and efficient pour. Nice beer overall though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The head is still rocky 10 minutes after pouring the last of the bottle in the glass. Caramel and toasty malts in the nose along with oranges/lemons, green hops, and bananas/spiciness from the phenols. Complex enough, but not as aromatic as I'd like. All of these flavors are present in the taste along with dark bread (rum bread?), figs or plums, cherries?, sweetness, and a hop bitterness that is more pronounced than most strong dark Belgians. The body is full with crisp carbonation that makes it a bit refreshing, and the drinkability is fairly high because it isn't too strong in flavor or alcohol to limit me to 1 or 2. Good stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Flavor seemed flat and dulled over the course of drinking.  Still better than a great many beers, but not up to snuff for a brewery of Unibroue's excellence.

I can only hope the taste can match it. Lemony citrus, spice, pepper, wheat, and something sweet that I cant put my finger on.  Yes... there is no denying the complexity of this one. Still, I was expecting a bit more after taking a sniff. But oh well, I'll just have to settle for 'very good' as opposed to 'amazing.' HUGE wheaty taste with a definite spicy undertone. But not only is this one spicy, it is moderately sweet as well... like a more subdued candy flavor. Extraordinarily well balanced, as is typical of many Unibroue beers I have sampled.  Rarely will I say the mouthfeel of a beer is unique, but this one definitely has its own flair. Active carbonation sprints across your tongue, as a malty thickness sets in and remains for long after the liquid has disappeared down your gullet.  Maybe the most drinkable of the Unibroue's I've tried...and with ""only"" and 8% abv (as compared to the 9.5-10% from la fin, trois, and don de dieu) it doesnt sneak up on you quite so fast. Extremely nice brew... highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BuckeyeNation,4.2,"Lucent tangerine with a rollicking and rolling amount of carbonation rushing up to an airy head of ecru foam that appears much too soft to persist or to lay down much lace. I've seen better heads on macro lagers. As predicted, the glass is spotlessly clean. I've decided to add the entire bottle to the glass (thanks to the rapidly shrinking head, there's room) and the now cloudy nature of the beer makes me appreciate the appearance a little more.  The nose isn't as powerful or as complex as it should be for the style. This bottle has been in my cellar for almost two years (the 'best by' date is still more than 7 months away), so I feel justified in expecting some amount of character. It's fruity and lightly spicy, but isn't all that intriguing.  Maudite is much better on the palate. The flavor profile is composed of sweet caramel-toffee, oranges, cherries, blackberries and a smattering of spices and herbs. It seems that several years of rest did not go to waste. This beer is as deep and as interesting as some of the best of the style. It doesn't have the sheer power and majesty of Belgium's finest, but it's still a fine BSDA in its own right.  The finish is long, allowing one to appreciate the flavors either individually or in combination. A piquant, spicy-herbal flavor lasts the longest. Sweet, dark berries aren't too far behind. The mouthfeel is tough to nail down. It's lightly chewy and supple, but is rendered airily breezy by a perfect degree of enlivening carbonation.  Before cracking the crown, I was expecting another acceptable, but unworthy of the hype Unibroue beer. I couldn't have been more wrong.

This one's a dark ale, and although this isn't one of my favourite styles of beer, I can still recognize an exceptional brew when I see it. This one poured a gorgeous cloudy dark hazel brown with a white fluffy head that billowed up for about two inches and knew how to stick around and left a delicate lace on my glass. Typically complex Unibroue aroma, fruity and strong, with yeast and malts also detectable.  The taste is also complex, and these guys go down easy for an 8% alcohol by volume beverage. A definite fruity sweetness, with a chocolatey taste mixed in and a pleasant aftertaste, this one is worthy of its brewery.

Taste is rather tart, but still complex, with flavors of grapes and citrus overpowering a minor malt presence. Some alcohol is noted, but not enough to lead one to think the ABV is 8%. Rather citric and acid like mouthfeel, but not so much to make this brew un-enjoyable. Good drinkability. I'd have this again.

S - Slight caramel notes underneath a vinous grape, blackberry and apple notes. Very nice.  T - A sweet grape and blackberry flavor with a peppery coriander spicing. A faint acerbic bitteness presents itself for just a moment, leaving with a sweet, slightly sour aftertaste.  M - A little thin, very refreshing and smooth.  D - Great.

A taste of zesty fruit flavor and tangy sweetness carres the tongue along with a hint of wheaty-yeasty flavor. malts become more evident as the brew warms.  Deceptively light (not a strong dark ale IMO) but only moderatley light. Not exactly smooth with suck zestiness and lively carbonation, but not overly heavy or bitey.

Slightly hazy, this one looks ""big"".  Aroma was mainly of heavy fruit and berries. I even got the sense of some slight soy sauce from it, which was strange.  Sipping, I notice a tart apple flavor with some type of berry along for the ride. Pretty yeasty in finish, and an apple cider aftertaste. Enjoyable.  Silky smooth at first, but a shot of carbonation keeps me from wanting another one. I full bodied brew that is enjoyable, but maybe a little too much sting on the tongue from the carbonation. Very interesting brew and fun. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,pjwilson,3.5,"appearance: suprising amber color, not that dark at all. At the bottom of the glass it was almost yellow, opaque. Makes me realize that a beligian dark and a true dubble are completly different beasts. Smell: mostly strong belgium yeast smell, not much malts in the smell Taste: yeast dominates this one. It's a bit too much imo. You can taste the semi-sweet malts in the back but it's still drier than average for a beligum. It's fruity i guess the mouthfeel is watery; drinkability average  something didn't click with me on this beer. It was good but not outstanding.

22,33,SkeeterHawk,3.97,"OK, so tjhis bottle says that it expires in October of 2007, so I think that I am safe with this one.  Appearance: Mostly clear deep caramel color with a small dense head at first pour. This head fell pretty quickly, and ended up being a small ring maintained around the edge of the glass by the bubbles rising. I dont notice any lacing.  Aroma: Sweet floral aroma. I smell flowers in this beer at first...I can pick out Jasmine in particular. There are also a lot of spicy notes lurking in the aroma. Some dark fruit lingers somewhere in there also.  Taste: The fruity esters are the first thing that I notice. There are some spices from the alcohol that come out to meet the senses in there somewhere. There are plenty of sweet caramel and candy-like flavors in here to keep the palate guessing. It starts out with a sweet flavor and then it mellows out because of the mouthfeel to end up feeling like it is dry on the palate. There is a bit of an alcoholic burn in the back of the throat when this beer gets done.  Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. The only problem that I see with it is that it is in a broad category. There are a lot of good aromas and flavors in this beer, and it has a good bit of complexity. If it were standing on its own merit, it would be excellent. Being classified as a Belgian Specialty, there are a whole lot of other really complex beers that we have to put this beer against. It is pretty good, but it only has a few prominent dimensions of flavor. It has some sweet caramel, some fruity esters, and a touch of spice. There is no sour component, or anything else to make you contemplate the multidimensionality of this beer. It is a fine brew, but it will take a lot for me to put this beer up on my own personal halls of beerdom.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The aroma is comforting--malty, caramely, a bit spicy. Nice mouthfeel, slight carbonation tingle. You wouldn't expect the high ABV from the taste, so look out! The taste matches the aroma well--malty, smooth, just a tad fruity. One of the great stand-bys to always have on hand.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Opens with a slight pop, then pours with a beautifully carbonated orangey head. The beer itself is unflitered, and is a gorgeous hazey red-orange colour. Strong autumn-like aromas erupt, dark spices, plum. Taste is predictably dense. Smokey flavours, raisins, coriander. Hides the alcohol reasonably well, although you know you're drinking a strong beer. Heavy thick, spicy mouthfeel, sticks in the throat and dosen't let go.

Picking up a bit of peaches, bananas and slight clove. A lot more going on here.  Mouthful - Pretty thin, pleasant carbonation.  Drinkability - Very drinkable. Great after dinner drink, one to relax with. Hidden 8% ABV makes it easy to drink, could sneak up on you.  Pretty impressive brew. This was my introduction to a whole new world of beer.

Be careful, this tastes like delicious candy...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The taste falls in line wonderfully. Rich and malty with dark fruit and an almost true root beer taste in there somewhere. Maybe it was the spicyness and the caramel that reminded me of a TRUE rootbeer. Very complex with each sip adding more and more. Mouthfeel was full with just enough carbonation. Definitly a sipper. Drinkability is good as I would go back for this again. Would be superb in the colder weather with a nice rich stew or braised meat. Or some roasted game with a rich dark fruit sauce.

Mouthfeel is nice, fine carbonation and very good drinkability.

There is a profusion of sediment in the bottle, if this is swirled, the color turns to that of coffee with a bit of cream. The head is small, off-white, and retains well. The lacing is thick and glass-coating. There are many streams of slow-rising bubbles.  Aroma: Profound note of ripe bananas, as well as nutty and earthy aromas, dark fruots, some caramel, and vinous alcohol.  Taste: Opens with a rather sweet, honey-like note, somewhat like mead, as well as light fruits. Midway through, there is a bitter chocolate and earth note and a late note of spicy alcohol. The taste draws to a close with a lingering, mild herbal hop note.  Mouth feel: Smooth and very soft on the palate, quite full in body.

Dark hazy brew, with a short lived tan head.  Smell is fruity, spicy, really complex.  Taste is tart, smoky, carbonation really gets you in every sip. Reminds me Unibroues Raftman.  Mouthfeel is creamy, robust and dry.  I could drink this one anytime, but I live in México and the weather is always a factor. Trois Pistoles is more for my winters, when the temperature drops maybe to the lower 40s (the last 15 days the minimum was 72° early one morning and highs around 110°).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A touch peppery, but more tart peach and buttloads of green apple and apple peels in this one. The apple character works with the bready malt character to give a nice flavor overall. Hops are not too noticable, and bitterness is not either. Overall very balanced, finishes a touch sweet and tart.  Medium bodied, carbonation is a touch annoying.  I would get this again, the flavor is interesting and I want to come back to it again for a second impression.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jamesclark,3.86,"It pours a muddy brown-orange in my glass, very hazy. The bubbles were immediate and plentiful. The cream-colored head reduced in a moderate amount of time.  It smells of yeast and malt, with that characteristic Belgian Dark smell that I cannot otherwise identify. Very slightly floral smell, with a small amount of sweetness.  It feels medium-bodied and creamy. A lot of fizzy bubbles are generated in my mouth as I roll it around. There is a significant sweetness. Bitterness is low, but present particularly in the finish. The alcohol (8.0%) is hidden. There is a special tanginess, crisp and citrusy, which is the primary flavor characteristic, and there is no noticable hop character. The beer finishes with a lingering sweetness and bitterness.  This beer is very drinkable - the complex flavors are assertive but not overpowering, and the carbonation, though significant, does not interfere.  A tasty beer. I would prefer less sweetness, and a little less carbonation, but I love the yeast character and the bold flavor, and I appreciate the bottle-conditioning. Also, the label is great.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

I remember being intrigued and even a little scared by the label, but I loved the beer.  Pours into the tulip glass with a release of pent-up carbonation. Sparkling, amber-hued, copper-edged body with a fabulously rocky, tumultuous, creamy, off-white head. Head stays forever, and laces beautifully.  Nose is powdered sugar, caramelized candy, mixed with tropical fruit esters (some banana, a little candied peach, kiwi) and a heady dose of Unibroue yeast. Luckily, I really like their yeast.  Sugary, wheatish malt has a sweet, candied fruit flavor that isn't overpoweringly sweet. Rum-soaked banana-raisin pudding sounds close. Full-bodied chewy feel without being cloying or syrupy. Yeasty, peppery bitterness does enough balancing to make this damned beer very drinkable.  Still a favorite after all these years (5!).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The beer poured out a murky orange/brown color with a 1"" creamy head that had great retention.Decent lacing. The aroma of this brew was Unibroue yeast, nice! There is some herb and spice in the nose also. The beer has a wonderful complex flavor. Filled with spiciness as it warms and a little touch of fruitiness(raisin,fig,plum?). Also some herby flavor in the background. The yeasty, bready flavor is great. Very fine offering from Unibroue. The beer has a creamy mouthfeel, the 8% alcohol is not readily apparent in the flavor. Maudite goes down very smooth and has good drinkability. The 8% might sneak up on you after a few.

The smell is of roasted malt -- a slight hint of coffee with a bit of ripened fruit lurking the background.  A delicious Canadian attempt at a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. The brew hits on all the right notes and is true to form.  Quite delicious! I will add several to the cellar and be hard pressed not to grab one instead of something else.

22,33,neonbrown82,4.37,"Yet another brew from fellow BA Chatter (and the last unique beer I have to review from the trade). This was probably my favorite all around from the 3 Unibroue brews I have yet tried. It is a bit lighter than the Trois Pistoles, but it is strong in areas where the TP tended to lack.  The appearance is an dark plum color with a thin head. This beer didn't for as perfect of a head as the other two Unibroue beers I collected from this trade, but it managed to stay through the duration of the glass. Looks beautiful in a tulip.  The smell is very fruity and berry-y. This beer seems to have an excellent smell whereas the Trois Pistoles was a bit lacking. Also, it doesn't seem to be quite as grainy, and has a bit more of a candi sugar aroma to it. Brilliant!  The taste is nothing short of brilliant as well. Has a definite candi sugar taste, though thoroughly malty sweet as well. Only has a tiny bit of a spicy hoppiness. The mouthfeel is slightly dry. It doesn't get much better than this. I wish I could get Unibroue products here in Iowa, because I've fallen in love tonight. As my parents are lovers of Sleeman for some reason, I'll have to save a bottle or two for them to enjoy the taste of a real beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Taste is immediately pleasantly sour. Apple skin taste is definitely there. The yeast makes an appearance to add some dimension and sharp spiciness as well, and the breadiness ties everything together. There is certainly some sugar in the back too. Definite warming, but the alcohol doesn't show up in the taste at all. Nice and creamy on the tongue - carbonation isn't overdone thankfully. Very nice.

Lots of fruit tempered by dry malts when first tasted. There's bread from the yeast and pepper from the alcohol. There's some sweet sugar notes that dance around with a citric tartness.

Malty dark fruits (currant and cherry) swim around with chocolate and coffee. Bready malts and Belgian candy sugar come through with some woody and hoppy bitterness near the end and when it warms.

Tread lightly as this is quite a drinkable brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Some calm spicy notes as well.  Taste is much lighter than I expected but it is still good. This may be because I thought it was Belgian Strong Dark ale as this is how it is listed on BA. However, Unibroue describes it as a Belgian Red. Anyhow, the flavor consists of very light fruit and spice, particularly apple and coriander. A solid sweet, but light maltiness pulls through in this brew. Very subtle hop flavor.  A very smooth and satisfying mouthfeel.  I like this brew very much but I think Unibroue has better offerings.

Smells are oranges, a hint of cocoa powder, bananas and something spicey.  The taste starts with tart fruit and alcohol. A subdued round malt surfaces, along with big fruit again, raisins, tartness and then it gets a bit sweet. A bit overwhelming. It actually finishes a bit dry, with an herbal tea quality.  The beer has a pleasing creamy fizziness with a medium body. The alcohol numbs you up a bit. Very emphatic, not a multi-tasker.

22,33,asabreed,3.65,"11.2 oz bottle from a 4-pack purchased today. Poured into a wine glass.  Appearance: Lots of sticky white laze, and a thick head that disappears pretty slowly. I wish the color were a little darker, as it's a bit dark apricot colored, meaning more hazy orange than hazy amber and brown, which is how I like this style. Still nice though.  Smell: Candied fruit, citrus, acidity and tartness -- all of this is up front. Yeast of course is also up front. I say orange and lemon zest way too much in my reviews, but it's evident here so I have to say it again. Slight wine-like aroma of alcohol, which is pleasant for it's vinegar-like qualities that goes together with the malts and aromas of fruit.  Taste: Acidity and citrus up front as yeast slowly comes into play with the malts. A lot of interesting things going on, though I wish I could discern more in the mix. Aftertaste slowly goes into a yeasty and malty finish with slight hop-like bitterness. I just wish it was better balanced, as that's the thing that hurts it the most.  Mouthfeel: Possibly a little too high on the carbonation? I feel a bit of a tingle in my throat that's not unpleasant, but it just doesn't seem quite right after a swallow for some reason.  Drinkability: I was hoping I'd have a lot to say about this beer, but that's not the case. Maybe it needs some cellar time? I love the Trois Pistoles, and I was hoping this would be just as good, though I tried not to be biased about it. This is still a decent brew, but I was just expecting more, especially since I've not been close to even remotely dissatisfied with a Unibroue brew. I guess I will try the cellar, and maybe in a year I'll review one of these suckers again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,BeerFink,4.5,"Freed from the bottle, this ale cascades into my official Maudite tulip a deep brown color, kicking up a bubbly white head. Lots of aroma to this one. Tropical fruits blend with crisp lemony citrous and waltz with bready malts, also some peppery spicy notes, with a touch of alcohol thrown in for good measure. The taste is damn complex - where to begin? Malts are big and form a bready, toasty backbone. Some semisweet caramel is present as well. Prickly lemon and bitter orange peel hops are strong but do not take control of your palate. Instead they fade into candy sugar and a spiciness that leads into the slight alcohol flavor. Also present is some banana and clove flavors, and a touch of yeastiness. Mouthfeel is very complex - creamy malts lay it down smooth, but the hops are very exciting to the tongue. Very nice and full. Drinkability is top notch, a devil of a brew. Maudite? Well I guess I am damned then.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Jacobier10,3.9,"12/20/2004: Absolutely unprecedented head. I poured it from a 12 oz. bottle in a tulip glass and the head just seemed to explode out of the bottle. The pour may have been a bit on the vigourous side, but not too much faster than I usually pour a beer. Nice aroma. Plenty of apples and pears and cirtus scents. The taste was very fruity as well. Leaning more towards the taste of apples. There was definitely a presence of alcohol which could not be missed. While not too rough on the palate, the alcohol taste took away from the drinkability. I don't know if it was me or if it was the beer, but I found it difficult to finish.  This was the 2nd Unibroue beer I have tried, Trois Pistoles was the first. I found many similarities but though the first of two was easier to drink. Nevertheless, I was intrigued by the Maudite, and it's something I want to try again for a second opinion.  Re-review [4/24/05]: Finally getting another shot at the Maudite as a result of bringing this back from Quebec with me in a mixed 12-pack. I have increased my previous ratings for smell and taste upon trying it again. The fruits really stand out and the aroma is more than pleasant. Taste was much better as well. The mouthfeel is the same as a result of the high ABV leaving my mouth a little dry. The presence of alcohol also keeps the drinkability down. Towards the end of the beer you realize that it gets increasingly difficult to finish, but is still enjoyable. A much better experience this time around and a fine brew indeed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mynie,4.2,"Nice little pour. Orange and gold, the color of maple syrup. Big head that turns quickly in a short layer of foam, like any good Beligan (even a Canadian one).  The scent is very light and crisp. Sweet malt predominates along with a lot of yeast and hints of allspice.  Tastes great! Yeast and malt sweetness upfront rushing quickly into a splash of juicy fruit--pear and apricot--and a very spicy finish. I can't place exactly what kind of spice this is, but it's wonderful.  Nice body, goes down smooth. A fine brew that everyone should try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,AlexJ,3.93,"12 oz. sample. Poured into my sweet, brand-new St. Bernardus goblet, it is a deep amber brew, obscurred by swirling yeast storms. It has the appearance of cloudy cider topped by a mighty, but shortlived head of wheat colored foam that leaves little blobs of clinging lace.  The aroma is pleasantly sweet, filled with layers of malt and tell-tale Unibroue yeast and spice. Perhaps a notch or two below my other favorite Uni's in terms of it's nose.  It starts of with a big, malty sweetness balanced with loads of yeasty, spice goodness. It displays notions of apple, pear, and faint banana. It finishes on the dry side, with just a touch of spicy hop tingle.  Mouthfeel is rather full, with a lush and creamy texture. Soft carbonation adds to the velvety mouthfeel. A good and classic beer from out friends to the North.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Omniscia,4.7,"Maudite, one of the crown jewels of flagship Quebec micro Unibroue, is a beer fit for a king. From its look, to its nose, to its taste, this one truly delights the senses. As one of the most widely-available of the Unibroue line, it is an excellent choice for introducing someone to better beer.  APPEARANCE: Deep, firey red. Almost completely opaque, with the occasional visible swirl of bubbles and yeast. Thick, white head that is unfortunately somewhat short-lived, but leaves behind an intricate lattice of lacing.  SMELL: Citrus and spice, my friend. Citrus and spice. And yeast.  TASTE: Sweet, at first. You'll almost immediately notice the twin assault of malty, yeasty characteristics, with strong notes of spice, but after it's had a chance to warm a bit and settle on your palate, the esters, and faint hints of citrus and apple, begin to emerge. Definitely a brew to keep on your tongue for a good spell, to fully appreciate its flavourful complexities.  MOUTHFEEL: Smooth, and thick, with some carbonation, and a distinct warming quality. This is a very full-bodied brew, and, as such, quite unsuited for pounding. This is a sipper.  DRINKABILITY: At 8% alcohol, definitely *not* a session beer, but after your first sip, you'll immediately want another. This one is quite versatile, though, equally at home in a pleasant, low-key conversational atmosphere, served at the dinner table with a hearty meal (game comes to mind), or simply chilling out with the evening news.  OVERALL: Mein Gott! This is one impressive brew! If you happen upon it, be sure to pick it up, lest you regret it forever.  A final note: If you live near the Quebec border, you may be able to find it in reasonably-priced cases of 12 at the duty-free shop.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mgdeth,3.92,"Appearance - Quite hazy, deep amber with tan head. Looks like a fire storm of carbonation going on. Looks like it could be infected or spoiled.  Smell - Malty smell. No hops, but no sign of spoilage.  Taste - Phenolic flavor; spicy. Slightly chocolatey, and caramely. At the foretaste the beer is sort of bready in flavor. Estery. Some alcohol taste is in there, too. The lees from the bottom of the bottle give the beer a yeasty flavor.  Mouthfeel - Highly carbonated. Good strong body, which seems right for a strong dark ale.  Drinkability - Very fizzy, which actually helps to temper the flavors in the beer. This is relatively easy to drink in spite of pretty big flavors and alcohol.  Comments - I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this seems to be a well-crafted beer. I'm not super crazy about the flavor either, but I think it is true to style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,thesilverhand,3.99,"Pours a dark hazy reddish-brown, with a massive off-white head which dissipated quite quickly. The nose is outstanding. I was assaulted by sweet malt and fruit esters - sweet apple, a touch of citrus - and caramel. It reminds me of caramel apples. Mmm. Alcohol is present, but not pervasive, in the aroma. The flavour is sweet and fruity up front. Apples and caramel are again quite prevalent. Further along, there is a pleasant earthiness, with hints of spice on the back end. The high alcohol definitely comes through in the flavour, and leads into a dry finish. Maudite is quite nice on the palate - not too heavy, and with a lot of active carbonation keeping it sparkling and flavourful. Overall, this is rather enjoyable beer. It's not Unibroue's best, but it's an above-average beer nonetheless. It's also very nice paired with blue cheese.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,nicechalice,3.63,"Foggy, orange-brown, semi-dark, clumps of small bubbles, frothy one finger head didn't stay long, lace didnt stay very long either.  I picked up scents of yeast, spices, lemon and some other fruits.  Tasted like alchohol and apples with some spices, was not bitter at all, seems to have a tiny similarity to some hefeweizens I have had.  The mouthfeel wasn't bad but for some reason kind of reminded me of soup.  I am not trying to pretend like I know what I am doing, this is my first review. 12oz bottle for 1.99 from Pavillion's in Santa Monica. I ate some extra aged gouda with it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,FLAbeergutinMASS,4.51,"Few words are how to appropriately describe this beer. Had it on tap at the Moan and Dove in Amherst. Great bar, bar tender was very knowledgeable and was generously hading out sample of the on-tap beers.  Poured chocolatey/hazel/nutella; very think head in a tulip glass.  Smell hard to describe, walnuts, oranges, cherries, loaded with complexity. Tasted as it smelled, kept its temperature nicely, wonderful aromas throughout its life.  I was completely blown away by this beer. It was like nothing I had every tasted before. After five of these monsters I guess that's a good indication about the drinkabilty of this OUTSTANDING beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,longarm,4.35,"From 12 oz bottle, pours a cloudy orange with a huge fluffy head of foam. Lots of tiny bubbles rise from the bottom to help retain carbonation.  Aroma dosed with hints of orange and apple. Light yeasty character lurks underneath a hint of sweet spices.  Slightly sweet up front, a mild dose of spices akin to cloves or cardamom coats the palate supported by slight caramel sweetness. In spite of this, it does not approach a cloying heaviness and has a surprisingly dry finsh.  Easily quaffed, this moderately complex beer has easily lived-up to expectations. It's not overwhelming, but not too simple either.  This was also enjoyed along with a wonderfully simple selection of cambozola, lox and light artisan bread. At the very least, I highly recommend pairing this ale with a soft bleu cheese.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,trancefishy,4,"Gorgeous frothy head, lots of valleys and hills, ah, lovely. nice clear dark amber colour for the beer.  aroma: unibroue yeast, underneath are some sweet, heavy malts, a spiciness like coriander, lemon peels, some dry leaves. mouth watering.  taste is light, a medium sweet with apples and pears and toast. a hop brightness shines through later with some lemon flavour and pine. has a nice dry and bitter finish to round out everything.  nice mouthfeel, spritzy but not overly so, enough to bring out the subtle flavours.  great beer, yummy!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Truh,4.15,"Looked over my shoulder and found I was running with the devil with this one on 3/20/2005. 16-oz. tall pilsener glass pour at 43° N.  Sudsy on the edges, but otherwise, completely clear of the white stuff  no lace and no stick. Very clean orange hue with some nice, gently ascending action that mesmerizes, though it could have just as easily have been the restaurants atmosphere. Cool, cool, cool as ice notes on nose with some jumpy grapefruit and kiwi aspects. Almost a spicy note on the mouth = white pepper, oregano; great malt base bangs through while hot alcohol cools things in a yin/yang sort of way. A reliable go-to.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BigBry,4.25,"750 ml bottle. Cork came off with a huge pop and dark fruity aroma. Poured in to my goblet and dark, burnt orange copper color. Filled glass with half liquid and half foamy, big bubbled head. Didn't leave a lot of lacing, but does have good stability, leaving a nice beige cap. Good carbonation keeps the foam from disappearing. The smell is fruity sweetness, but not overpowering, lots of yeast noted coming throught too. Aromas of toffee and raisin. The taste is quite complex, sweet and firm. Plum and dried fruit and just a small bite on the lips. Full mouthfeel - thick almost syruplike, but not overly sugary. A touch of yeast in the finish that helps cleanse and refresh the mouth so you are ready for the next sip. The second half of the bottle had more yeast and the color of the liquid changed to a murky ice tea color. Warming up a bit brought out even more aroma and flavors. Very impressed, tastes similar to Edition 2004, imo. I would have this as an after dinner drink when everyone else is having their scotch or port. Have another bottle in the cellar, so will be interested to see how this ages in a year or five.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,SupaCelt,4.25,"Maudite ran into the goblet glass with a hazy dark tan appearance. The head came up as a bubbly plume, similar to Trois Pistoles but not as volatile in bubbly effect, then shrank back down without much lingering in lace. There is moderate carbonation, but overall a more thick body as opposed to light and effervescent. Looks good.  The smell is a robust dark fruit waft. Nice malt sweetness in the nose. Yeast refermentation leaves its character spliced in with the fruits. Vague spice, but not too much. Smell is very nice.  The taste comes off with an apple cider like sweetness and a bite to the tongue in the finish. Vividly fruity and reminiscent of a wine in a beer sorta way. Nice flatness with not much carbonation effect noted in the mouth. Juicy texture. Slight aftertaste that continues to satisfy after the swallow. I sipped this girl down over a good stretch of time due to the sweetness. The time span facilitated the warming effect which just made the complexity of the flavors stand together to be marveled at. There is no lack of rich flavoring here. Excellent.  I think I could drink a couple of the 12 ounce bottles and be perfectly satisfied for a night. The intensely fruity flavor and the alcohol content would stay within perfect limits and I would be satiated without having plunged overboard. This really is an excellent brew. Surely not a guzzler or a gulper, but one to be savored. Unibroue seems to be rocking the house.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,hefevice,4.19,From bottle in large wine glass (close to chalis). Poured orangy brown with small head and little retention. Big fruity aroma with hints of honey and brown sugar. Same for the taste with a slightly bitter finish. Was so smooth I hardly noticed the alcohol until it hit me later. Nice drop.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,theo871,4.2,"The bottle says this beer means ""damned"" They're right, I've never had such a damned good beer!  Appearance is cloudy amber, with a large cascading head. The smell is sweet and fruity, and the taste is the same, with lots of spice. It jumps off your tongue in a spicy way, and is surprisingly drinkable for such a high ABV.  Damned indeed!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Hibernator,4.35,"I had the Unibroue Maudite out of a 12 oz brown bottle and served in a tulip glass. There is a best before date on the back of the label for 04-22-07.  Pours a hazy light brown color with a fluffy head at first, but it quickly turns into a thin lacing. Some mini carbonation bubbles continue to rise a few moments after the pour.  Aroma of spices, Belgian yeast, sweet malts and fruity esters. Whiffs of apples and pears in the nose.  Sweet malts and Belgian yeast with clove spices take charge on the palate. The perfect blend of peppery spices and sweet malt mouthfeel. Some sips remind me of an apple cider like sweetness and zing.  Simply put, this is a great beer. Well crafted and very, very drinkable at 8.0 % ABV. Another excellent beer from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,beertastegood,3.97,"Pours a clean copper color with a minimal head, even with an aggressive pour. Smells of dark fruit (raisins) and malt. Very slight alcohol aroma. Tastes of bread, dark sweet malt and fruit. The finish has a noticeable alcohol twinge, but it is not unpleasant and does warm the stomach. Finish is surprisingly clean, with a slight yeasty flavor lingering on the palate. Pretty good. I will have to try more Unibroue beers in the future.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,twelvsies,4,"A solid Belgian style ale. Not anything too amazing, for Belgians that is, but certainly above average. A nice dark red brown color with a bit of tan head on top that sticks around for a few mins. Smells and tastes like a nice sweet loaf of banana bread, raisins, Belgian spices, cloves, and some nice hearty malts and just a touch of floral hops. Like I said, this is a great beer but in my mind it doesn't stand out compared to the best of Belgium.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,baiser,4.17,"A cellared 2003 keg, on tap at the beer bistro. Appearance was a bit disappointing. Virtually no head or lacing. Red/mahogany body. Aroma of fruit, spices, breadiness, sweetness and alcohol. Taste was excellent. Very mellow, smooth, ripe fruits, estery, cloves/spices and a good hop bitterness. Medium bodied, wonderful mouthfeel. Great with food.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,droomyster,4.27,"I've been looking forward to this for a long time. Brought home a 750 ml bottle. Fragrant fruity spiciness, rambunctiously sweet and peppery taste. Darker amber red, medium foamy head that it maintains until youre almost through. I know it's not fair to compare apples and oranges, but Trois Pistoles is still my favorite Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,vitesse,4.12,"poured from 355 mL bottle.  pours a nice light brown color, with a very cloudy appearance. small head that recedes quickly. this 6-pack came straight from MTL, so freshness isn't an issue. lovely spiciness that really hides the alcohol well. slight tangy sourness is in there, but plenty of sweet malty goodness balances it. another very solid unibroue beer that bears the mark of their signature yeast profile. drink this puppy!!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,PorterLambic,4.13,"Pours a rich, amber/orange with a big fluffy, creamy head with good retentino and tons of lace. Smell is fruit, malt, hops, and some spice, mostly pepper. Taste is same as the smell wih some bitterness in the aftertaste. I keep thinking this beer should be more complex but it doesn't bother me. It's just good. The balance is spot on. Mouthfeel is smooth with a light effervescenceand a medium/full body. Warms the throat some, too. Drinkability: on tap, all day long.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Sammy,4.02,"A darkish colour, some spice in nose and a fine drink. Tad sour like some darks. Pepper, strong biting carbonation, much better on tap than in bottle. In bottle, more of Unibroue yeast. Medium to watery mouthfeel. Spice with some malt aftertaste, similar to a cola. Belgian style and unique.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,GeoffFromSJ,4.11,"Poured with an exceptional head into a wine glass. Very big. Two finger widths. Thick lacing throughout. Tastes like Duvel.

Smell: Yeasty and malty with a faint and subtle fruityness.  Taste: Malty and bready; spicy like the nose. Nutty, peppery, with subtle esters, candy sweet finish becoming peppery at the end.  Mouthfeel: Thin and carbonated with a dry finish.  Drinkability: This is a beer I find myself returning to quite frequently. Good session despite the ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,rkhaze,4.24,"Pours a bright tea color with a small foamy off white head. Disappated rather quickly and had a noticeable lack of carbonation. Smells complex. Malty and fruity. Sweet malt, some spiciness and lots of tropical fruit. Some bubble gum hints as well. Rich full malty flavor. Tangy yellow and orange fruits, brown sugar, light yeast tartness and a pleasant bitterness in the finish. Nice balance of flavors. Medium bodied with a light, almost flat mouthfeel. I was expecting more carbonation. Perhaps I got a bad bottle. Best by 3/07 hmm? Great aromas and flavor but the mouthfeel was a bit of a surprise. Hurt the drinkability a bit for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smell is a very sweet combination of pleasant yeast odors some breadyness and a very strong mango like fruit prescence. Very complex and nice.  Taste is very nice, not as sweet as the smell would indicate, a very smooth brew with a nice maltiness with hints of severyal fruit including bananas, apricots, and dates. Changes to a nice woody and clove finish. A very nice complex beer.  Mouthfeel has a nice medium body with a slight carbonation fizzyness to it along with a very dry finish.

22,33,kosmoraios,4.63,"Unibroue never ceases to impress me. This ale pours a glowing semi-opaque reddish-amber with a great head that is just the right size. Looks great in a Duvel tulip glass. Smells are so complex I don't know where to begin. Sweet malts, freshly-baked sourdough bread, mango, papaya, maybe a hint of caramel. Taste is wonderfully complex. The malts are amazing. The yeast provides the perfect base for the myriad flavors that begin to emerge as this ale warms. I taste wheat, white grapes, mango, plum, nectarine. I taste perfectly placed hints of spices: ginger, cardamom, cloves. The hops, yeast and malt are perfectly balanced in this ale. Of course, I may be a bit biased, as this is my favorite style by far. Mouthfeel is wonderfully peppery and smooth with just the right amount of everything. Even the ABV is perfect - not to much, not too little. Wonderfully drinkable for this style - very close to perfection for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

22,33,skybluewater,4.2,"Pours a cherry-tinged apple cider color. Fizzy head recedes to nothing and leaves no lace. Smell's a touch weak, but in general like every other Belgian I've tried: Sweet malt. Tastes of roasted bananas and pepper (as well as other spices), and also some bready malt. Mouthfeel's a bit fizzy at first, and also a bit thin, but both of those improve as the beer warms.  Overall, this is a good Belgian, although compared with La Fin Du Monde and Trios Pistoles (the latter I didn't review when I drank it-good though!), it's a bit weak. Nevertheless, this one hit the spot on this cold, blustery winter night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Anyway pours a cloudy medium brown, loose off white head, first its rocky and pillowy and then it settles fairly quickly to a film. Doesnt leave much lace. Nose is rum soaked raisins, sweet, yeasty. This is a tasty, complex, dark ale, spicy, phenolic, raisins, prunes, rum, wood, smoke, alot going on here. Alcohol present, but not overpowering. More rum and alcohol in the finish. Strong, flavorful brew. Those Canadians sure brew some strong tasty Belgian beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

I knew I had to buy it and drink it while wearing a Slayer shirt.  I had to go buy a Slayer shirt, but that was no problem. I mean hey... it's Slayer.  I have to admit that, judging by the packaging, I had expected it to be swill. (I wasn't yet familiar with the greatness that is Unibroue.) Boy, was I wrong. This is one fine beer. I've had many, many more since that day.  It pours a very dark brown with not much head, and smells like caramel and dark friuts.  The dark fruits are prevalent in the taste as well, along with anise. It's a bit sour, but not in a bad way.  This is one of my favourite beers. I'll definitely be having more. And soon.

Taste has a moderate acidic toasted caramel and wheat malt; moderate pine, resin, grapefruit, and lemon/lime hops; and has a moderate finish with hints of cask wood, champagne, vanilla, and cola.

Off the tap, the beer poured a hazy light brown color with a small head that just coats the beer. The nose was fruity caramel with a light peppery character, but overall, a bit light. There was more peppery spice inthe flavor than the nose would have told, as well as a nice caramel flavor and a slightly bitter finish. The feel was way too thin for me. Where was the body in this beer? Just an okay beer. I managed to drink a pitcher of it, so it wasn't that bad, but I've hd better from unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The taste is of caramel, malts, plums and raisins. It has a interesting chalky finish. The alcohol taste starts to emerge after a few sips, but it never becomes overpowering. The beer also has a slightly sour taste that I think compliments the other flavors.  Very low levels of carbonations which seems to suit this beer. I like this beer, but it would be a once an evening treat for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Taste is bitter malt, with a slight hoppiness that I've tasted in other Belgian ales. Good flavour, but a little overwhelming on the alcohol taste. Not entirely unpleasant, but nothing to call exceptional. Carbonated, but not too fizzy. Nice drinking; goes down easily. Better than many beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,redmosquito,3.53,"Pours a mahogany brown with a lingering champagne like head. Aroma of spicey yeast, minerals, and malt. The flavor isn't overly sweet, and not to bitter, it's bready, somewhat toasted and yeasty with minerals. I'm impressed with the smoothness of this. There is no 8 % alcohol bite in this, which makes it very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,swamiswamu,4.1,"The votive behind the glass gave the beer the apperance of a fiery potion. Really this one had more in common with wine than beer in the taste department. Was that pepper, apple, saffronn, who knows? It was incredibly complex and I would expect no less from Unibroue. The drinkability is lacking, one was more than enough and this isn't a beer I'll have often. I mush prefer Fin du Monde.

22,33,santoslhalper,4.5,"My 100th review. How quick it came....  Appearence: Pours a murky copper with a black flakes. The off-white head is tremendously turbulent, and leaves nice lacing. The carbonation up the sides is perfect.  Smell: The aroma is sweet and spicy. HInts of pepper and citrus poke through, with a strong, intense alcohol backing.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Instantly tart with a strong clove and pepper taste. All malts in the beginning, and a nice amount of hops in the end round it off. I detect and oakish and almost vanilla flavor. The alcohol is nicely masked, but it's still there and actually helps round the beer off. The mouthfeel is bubbly and smooth.  Drinkability and Overall: A rich, complex, and damn tasty treat. A very Belgian-style ale, that is just as good as most stuff currently coming out of Belgium. My first shot at Unibroue and I'm blown away. I wish I could get this around here. Try this.

22,33,blitz134,4.25,"Huge head on this one, might have been a bit of a hard pour. Nonetheless, it shrank rather quickly to an even layer of small bubbles. Cloudy and dark brown in color, dark caramel with a touch of brandy coloring sums it up.  Aroma of dark fruits, some plum and raisin, quite sweet smelling overall. Very inviting. Flavor profile follows suit with the aroma, dark fruits dominate, a bit of sour cherry and plum. Quite sweet just like the aroma. There is a nice malt flavor which keeps this beer in check and adds a good bread aftertaste. Alcohol only adds a slight touch of sweetness, nothing overpowering by any means.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but doesn't detract much. Drinkability is a good overall. I could easily have a couple of these with a nice dinner or just sitting around for that matter.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,GClarkage,4.38,"12/05/04- Purchased at a wine shop in Sonoma, CA  Appearance- Pours a nice cloudy copper-amber color with a huge fluffy white head and decent lacing. Has those beautiful round galaxy puffs of white floating on the surface.  Smell- I bit too much alcohol in the scent. A bit of the same aroma of the beer I just had (NB Abbey) but a bit sweeter. Maybe a little floral character. Raisins and maybe some clove.  Taste- Nice and sweet. The alcohol hides well in the taste. Kind of a thick caramel taste. Quite yummy.  Mouthfeel- Warms you when you swallow, high carbonation, but easy to consume. Considerable creamy.  Drinkability- My buddy swears by this beer and I can see why now. Good deal for $2.39 for a 12oz bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,RBorsato,4.7,Copper/amber color with a nice beige head and active carbonation. Nice black pepper and coriander spiced aroma with a dark fruitiness to balance. Spiced pepperish and malt flavors .. much like it smells; alcohol seems to be well hidden. Medium bodied but smooth with a spicy dry finish.  Very easy drinking for the style .. wish there was a Belgian Strong Medium Ale style to put this in. :-)  Per Label: Maudite = Damned  Best Before: 10/21/05 Tasted: 12/01/04  ($2.33 / 12 oz.),Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,HardTarget,3.42,"12 oz foiled twist top with best by (06-26-06) date, 8% abv listed, ale on lees bottle re-fermentation and serving glass suggestion (goblet, not flute). Aged for about 18 months in my closet and decanted into my New Belgian goblet. Aroma: Strong spicy Unibroue-Belgian yeast with a nice orange rind and pepper smell. Appearance: A brown peach color. Scanty off white head that didnt even try to lace. Flavor: Vinous, high octane stuff. Doesnt hide the alcohol, it showcases it. The effect is one of bitter malt, a neat trick from a brewing standpoint, but it just seems wrong taste-wise. Dark fruits typical of the style are represented, plum and fig most notably. There is a certain malt liquor taste of added sugars. Mouthfeel: It numbs me to the core. I really feel the tingle between the teeth and gums, and I can feel it working its way back to my spine. Carbonation is very strong; it turns to fizz in my mouth. Ill try to let it breathe a bit. Overall Impression: I fear Im entering my Cedar Fever blackout period for beer reviews. My allergies are kicking in today so my nose and sinus are a bit raw. This beer may be a bit much for me, so Ill temper scores with previous happy tasting memories. This sample is proving too spicy, too carbonated and a bit lacking in taste. Sad notes for a great brewery and a good beer Ive enjoyed before.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TastyTaste,4.92,"Pours a hazy maroon color with a big white head, into my schell's tulip. Smells yeasty, spicy, and very intriguing.

22,33,markman,4.03,"Unibroue Maudite (best before 01/29/07):  Ahh, Unibroue MauditeIll be damned. Slightly cloudy garnet pour sits under a beautimus two inch head that dissipates quickly into an even 1/8 inch head of fine bubbles. Aroma is kind of yeasty with some spice thrown in, and perhaps some dried fruit. This brew is balanced to perfectionmalty spice seamlessly fades into a yeasty hoppy finish, and leaves with a smile. Very nice example, and a nice choice to compliment a hardy Italian red sauce.  Cheers...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,KoG,4.15,"After pulling the cork out I had to make a run away from the carpet... must have gotten jostled a bit or something.  Pours into the glass a hazy red-orange with a giant amount of off-white head that settles slowly and leaves a small layer floating on top, not much lacing on the glass itself.  While cold little aroma could be found which seemed a bit musty. After letting it warm up a bit more, alcohol and ripe fruit show their presence with a bit of spice.  Taste had the same attitude as the smell, more prominent when warmer. Not as heavy as I had expected, light alcohol presence that numbs the tongue a bit but is overtaken by a ripe fruit and spice mixture with little hoppyness supported by a nice malty backbone. Very well balanced, quite possibly the most balanced beer I've had.  Mouthfeel was easily the best feature for me. Went down nice and smooth with no bad aftertaste or alcoholic burn.  A very nice holiday selection if you feel like a Belgian as it will complement just about anything and not overpower.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ElGordo,4,"Popped the cork out of the 750ml champagne bottle and it flew across the room above the Thanksgiving turkey. Poured into my Duvel tulip glass a dark brown hue that becomes more and more murky as it nears the bottom of the bottle, almost like apple juice. Great carbonation - tiny, tiny bubbles just keep on coming. Slighly sweet aroma of roasted malt, prunes, brown sugar, light hoppy bitterness, and some serious alcohol. Incredibly complex palate. Notes of brown sugar, sweet malt, dark, sweet fruit, and earthy yeast. Highly alcoholic finish is very warming. Mouthfeel is thick and slightly syrupy, very nice for the style. Takes a while to drink, but is imminently satisfying even an hour after pouring.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,amicar,3.72,"From a 750mL bottle. Pours with moderate white head, which disspates at a medium pace. A cloudy brown appearance with a little orange mixed in. The smell suggests overpowering fruity esters; but on the first sip, they are not as present as expected. Certainly plenty of body and malt. You can taste the roasted malts/ ?crystal malt. However, tastes a little too tannic. Has a warm alcoholic sensation in the throat without being too harsh.  Overall, pretty good, but not the best offering from Unibroue. I don't know what it is, something just feels a little off balance. I would have this again, certainly; but it would not be the first thing I would reach for. I can't see myself having more than one in a night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,cncbofh,4.58,Wow.  750ml bottle. Poured a very icky orange color - like rotting leaves. Tons of yeasty sediment. Smelled of sweet peaches and cloves. Banana esthers.  Oh so good. The taste is out of this world. Creamy vanilla bean malt flavor with just the slightest touch of hops. Well balanced and the alcohol is just warming enough to make my stomach happy.  Excellent.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,SaunaKing,3.73,poured a brown and cloudy color with a tan fizzy head that settled down to a ring around the beer. Aroma was nice but very faint and difficult to pick up. Did not overpower you. Maudite tasted slightly sweet and lemony with a nice but tangy finish. Felt like candy on the toungeand for an 8% abv quite drinkable.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,RenoZymurgist,4,Poured a rich orange that has an almost brown character to it with a frothy white head that subsided quickly to leave a layer of bubbly foam. Aroma is very complex with sweet malts and a lot of alcohol and yeast fruitiness. The flavor is a rush of a barely perceptible hop bitterness and a sweet malt flavor balanced by a dry estery finish that has a lingering alcohol prescence and a mineral water like taste. The mouthfeel has a fine belgian style carbonation that rushes a lot of small bubbles all over your tongue without having the bite of arificially carbonated beverages. The body of this ale also has a Belgian feel to it too as I am sure they achieved the high alcohol of this brew using kettle sugars. Very drinkable on a cold night when this ale is at about 50 degrees F and poured into a snifter like glass it is very expressive of it's flavors yet has a refined balance.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Zraly,4.85,"Pours a hazy copper-orange with a slight film of a head comprised of small, compact bubbles. A beautiful spicy smell that speaks of Noble hops. I am reminded of homebrewing a hefeweizen and smelling the Hallertau hops. Aroma ambrosia.  Flavors of slight toasted malts, apple and dried cherries inundate the senses at first. Yeasty bread rears its pretty lil' head. Then a subdued clove spice kicks in, complimenting the initial scent. Warm, alcohol tones. And watch out! It's super smooth, so it is considerably sneaky at abv 8%.  Overall, wonderful, full-on fruit flavors with rich backings of spice and even a note of fresh herb. The more you drink it, the more you find in terms of flavors. And the more you drink it, the more you like it. A sign of a true epicurean delight.  I can drink this solo. I can drink this with fresh greens and bleu cheese. I can drink this with a nice medium-rare delmonico steak. I can drink this with a vegetarian mexican lasagna. See where I'm going?  A masterful ale selection that won't disappoint. Serve it to your wine snob friends and laugh at them when you tell them you only paid $5.99 for a 750 ml bottle.  One of my all-time favorites.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,RedBaron,4.15,"Strong, devilish ale from Unibroue.  Appearance: Dark, murky orange. Good head. Smell: Raisin-y, plum-y; Good malt tones. Not much hop here. Taste: Complex maltiness up front. Fruity, banana and berry middle. Good finish, but perhaps just a tad too sweet. This sample tastes liked like a younger port. Could possibly rate a 4.5/5.0 in another year, or two Mouthfeel: Solid, full-bodied ale. Leaves the palette nice and warm. Good yeasty residuals, to compliment the sugars. Drinkability: Very good. Solid ale on cold night. Admire the Belgian-like approach to this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,tatterdash,4.2,"Bought a 750 ml bottle of this for an evening of movies. It's an old favourite.  Pours a hazy coppery brown with a foamy off-white head that oddly disappeared rather quickly, which was odd for Maudite. Smells very spicy with a few citrus notes. Taste is a strong yeasty spiciness with hint of orange gets much better as it warms up, becoming more mellow and smoother. It also hides the ABV very well, and sneaks up on you like most Unibroue ales do... which I like. I should have bought two bottles...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,crookedhalo,4.2,"75 cl cork and caged bottle. Pours a hazy orange color with some brown highlights and a lasting light beige head. Bready and yeasty aromas with a fair amount of fruitiness and spice in the background. Predominantly malty, but the yeast imparts a dryness and light tartness into the finish, making it very nice. Rather fruity, maybe taking on fresh fig, mango and pear, very subtle vegetal notes, too. Alcohol is pretty well hidden, which is a plus. Overall, a very nice and enjoyable beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,etaggie09,4.35,"Appearance: a light brown apple ciderish color haze with a quickly diminishing head. Tons of sediment is floating around. Moderate carbonation.  Aroma: Sweet and fruity with a good malt backbone. Some pear and apple smell.  Taste: pear-like sweetness with a nice malt balance. a good sweet, somewhat dry and bitter aftertasting beer. Very enjoyable. a nice example of the style.  Mouthfeel: Excellent. Good use of carbonation.  Drinkability: Doesn't seem like 8% ABV. Very easy to drink.  Notes: This is a great beer from a great brewery. I will have to try it again in comparison with La Fin Du Monde because I loved it. I have also had the Trois Pistoles, and I didnt think it was that amazing although I did drink it a bit too cold.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Gavage,4.33,"Pours a slightly hazy dark amber color with a nice 2"" white head. The aroma is of malt, pepper, spices, and yeast. The flavor is big, as malt is nicely balanced with spices such as pepper and clove, a nice bitterness level, alcohol, and a touch of honey.  The mouhfeel is slightly crisp at the start with a crisp dry finish. Medium bodied and slightly strong carbonation levels. The malt and pepper tones last long on the tongue. Extemely drinkable and an overall tasty brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dgallina,3.5,A medium-bodied red belgian-style ale. Large head and lacing with strong carbonation. Spicy aroma. Medium heavy and relatively creamy mouth-feel.

22,33,sardonic,4.23,"Um, cool bottle. I should probably preface this by saying that this is my first time trying a Unibroue product, or any beer of this type. Cloudy dark amber color, not much head but that's probably my fault for not pouring it all that well. Tastes very spicy and even though I could definitely detect the higher ABV, that's not a bad thing. I give drinkability a 4 even though you would definitely need water in order to drink a few of these...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,cooter,4.55,"""341mL"" Canadian bottle of 8%, poured overly heady. Foam looks bright and heavy. I can feel the alcohol content smacking my eyes after only a few swallows, wow.... Smells tart. Looks indian red. Tastes like red...dunno what that means. Synesthesia. Berries, wheat, alcohol, esthers, malt, clean pennies, and marinara sauce all come to mind (no joke). Definitely suggests a larger serving due to complexity. Good lord does it make you feel good, too! Smooth, not too carbonated, creamy. A simply fun aftertaste. An enjoyable, drinkable belgian which manages to be simple enough to drink and forget, yet complex enough to sit and try to figure out what's in it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,beerceller99,4.2,"75 cl.bottle with a 03-05-05 drink by date. Has a hazy amber-orange color with a decent head. A peppery, spicey smell, medium bodied with a nice creamy mouthfeel.

A nicely crafted brew that has aged well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Alcohol was extremly well hidden. It snuck up on me and before I realized it I was a little loopy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,soper2000,4.2,"Another new bottle selection at Chumley's. Although I've frequently had this brew available for purchase, I've never actually got around to it. Tonight things will be different. The beer pours a deep amber white a tan head that was a tad bit smaller than I expected. No excess of carbonation on this one. Aroma had faint notes of dark fruits and roasted malts. A yeasty aroma was also present. The taste reminded me A LOT of Trois Pistole. Lots of dark fruit, but with a more bread like flavor than the 3 pistole. An excellent experience for me and I look forward to picking up a four pack and expanding on this review.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ken3c,4.18,"Light amber with a big puffy head. It sticks to the glass only in spots. Massive amounts of bubbles feeds the big head.  There is strong smell of ripe banana, mango, and a hint of alcohol.  Tastes of sweet bananas and alcohol. A little like a well carbonated bananas foster.  Light to medium body and very effervescent.  I enjoyed this more and more as I drank. I'm looking forward to the next one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,danadeny,3.98,"Lots of carbonation infused in a light chocolate colored body with nice sediment swimming around. The smell is crisp, orange peel and spice. A nice amount of spice in the flavor especially on the finish where the spice bite mixes with the carbonation and tingles the tongue. Spice is the dominant flavor, a little more balance would be nice, speaking of balance, no alcohol was detectible, and just a very little hop at the finish. With the flavor mostly being spice I would have given it less than a 4, but for some reason the spice can earn a 4 all on it own, with out the help of other flavors. The mouth feel was smooth, with some carbonation tingle, and an over all surprising drink ability.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,diamonddave,4.34,"First off, this beer (as with most of the Unibroue beers) has one of the coolest label designs in the biz. The label looks like it could have been the cover of a Heavy Metal magazine circa 1979. I know this doesn't make the beer taste any different, but it does make you feel hip while you're drinking it.  The beer itself is a murky brown apple cider color. Kinda smells like apple cider too, mixed with a bit of grain. There's something else going on here that I can't quite figure out... like wood or something. (Huh, huh. I said ""wood."")  The taste is crisp and refreshing. Very bubbly and lively, and the alcohol gives it a nice clean bite. The flavor is pretty complex and, at least for me, hard to pin down. All kinds of fruits, malt and hops are dancing around. Pouring in the yeast from the bottom of the bottle makes it even more confusingly tasty.  This goes down way too easy, and at 8% ABV, the buzz will hit you quick. ""Drinkable"" is an understatement. If I could afford to, I'd drink it all the time. ($47.99 a case? What the hell?) This is one Damned fine beer. (Pun intended, unfortunately.)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,DrJay,4.22,"Hazy copper-orange colour with a thin lace of white foam that keeps replenishing itself due to carbonation. Aroma consists of ripe fruitiness and maltiness, with some spice and alcohol as well. Sweet, almost wine-like character is present in the flavour. Sharp fruitiness and lightly phenolic spiciness, just a hint of black pepper with a stronger clove-like flavour. High carbonation and noticeable alcohol warming with a smooth texture and medium/full body. The finish is just slightly bitter, with the phenols and sweetness carrying through.  341 mL brown bottle with bottling date on the back label.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,SilentSabre,4.67,"Very impressed with this one. Nothing like I thought it would be. Poured a reddish bronze/brown with almost no head at all. The smell is very spicy and a bit fruity with the maltiness in there aswell. The taste, too, was very spicy. Some malt, alot of fruit. Delicious! Not very carbonated and as such, very easy to drink. Again, I'm very impressed with this and will likely buy it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BobLuvBeer,3.88,"Fizzy, medium head, sits on a hazy amber color. Fruity, malt aroma which has a finish of alcohol in it. Strong spice and alcohol in the taste.

22,33,zjungleist,4.22,"I belive this might be my first ""corked"" beer. Not just a beer with a cork (please).... but with actual peices of cork in the beer. The cork appears to be damaged on the way in to the bottle. I havent found the pieces in my glass yet, but who knows, they may have been water logged and sank.  Nice pour though. Loose foamy head. Distinct hop aroma, yeast, malt, slighy sugary, and maybe a hint of citrus.  Taste is sweet malt, yeast, then hop. Hints of fruit in the after taste, hot alcohol, and then an almost slighly soapy finish. Hop nose and flavor becomes more floral as it breathes. Malt flavor stepped up a notch too. Soapyness died off a bit.  Never found any cork, maybe it just disintegrated. I didn't pick apart every little piece of yeast to find it though. Overall a decent brew, sweet and malty, with a nice hop to it. Slightly better than La Fin Du Monde, of the same maker. Its flaws are easy to overlook.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,WetCoaster,4.57,"Corked 750 ml  Appearance: A slightly cloudy burnt orange with a thin, creamy, short-lived pure white head. Carbonation is fine, almost champagne like and quite active. A collar and slight head lasted throughout. Some legs on the glass as well. Looks good.  Smell: These guys have the Belgian thing down. Funky yeast hit you first, followed by a wonderfully deep herbal base with a juicy citrus bite floating over. Sometimes yes, sometimes no vanilla. Dee-licious.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Holy crap, my taste buds just got a full massage with happy ending. Starts out rich and spicy, with strong clove, coriander and ginger notes. A non-malty sweetness hits mid-tongue, but soon a wash of blood orange tang comes from nowhere to finish. There seems to be a bit of displaced hoppiness roaming around there as well. Stellar. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with some carbonation up front, but it's a bit flabby; it just sort of lays there.  Drinkability: I don't care if the body's not great and it's 8%, the flavor is so stunning I'd drink it as long as humanly possible. This is joy in glass, kids.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

The head finally dissipated to a thin film leaving traces of lace all over my glass.  Smell: Fruity and spicy. Strong yeast aromas. Plums, clove, and dates.  Taste: Bready and yeasty. Sweet ripe fruit. Spicy alchol esters. Very light hop kick is enough to please.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, smooth and crisp.  Drinkability/Overall: Very easy to drink. Almost too easy.

22,33,coasterfreak75,4,"The pour was dark copper red/amber with a good two finger head that slowly dissapated leaving a white film on top of the beer that held on throughout the drink.  The smell was very fruity and spicy. Heavy in apricots and dates with some coriander and maybe some hidden hops late in the nose. The spice showed more as the beer warmed in the glass.  The drink started with a heavy fruit taste, around the middle of the tongue the spice showed up. The finish was lingering hops with and oily attribute followed by a light alcohol heat.  All and all a good beer to drink with friends and discuss the merits of beer drinking. But I don't think it would go good with food and it's not the most refreshing beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CAMRAhardliner,4.63,"Unibroue has the coolest bottle designs, and this one is my favorite of the bunch. The beer pours out of the 750 ml corked bottle a rusty brown color with an ample foamy head. There is frenetic carbonation going on in the glass. I noticed lots of yeast settling at the bottom as well, which looks interesting. The Aroma is figgy maltiness, spices and some alcohol, theres a hop presence in the back. The taste is very spicy, with coriander and cloves, and different fruits. All this is anchored by a solid but subtle hoppiness. It has complex and rounded flavors and conceals its alcohol content very well. The mouthfeel is smooth and a little bit oily, it coats the mouth. I really like this beer, unibroue is probably the best Canadian brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,99bottles,3.44,"Appearance: In a tulip glass this beer has a cloudy orange-red body topped with a thin head that fades to a resilient white lacing that lasts throughout the drink.  Smell: Whoo! I get super hard phenols. This is a band aid. Ummm, spiciness and sweet bread want to come through, but the medicinal scent overwhelms.  Taste: Not too bad, but not quite what I was hoping for. This is all over the place, but keeps its feet firmly planted in spicy, medicinal, phenolic, yeasty ground. It's interesting in how this beer changes as you drink it. Some clove and sweet-sour-spicy fruit tastes akin to rotten pears linger. Not bad, but it sure is different. Almost like a confused saison and belgian dark ale got together.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated, stays light in the mouth but still is apparently a higher (8%) alcohol beer.  Drinkability: Eh, I'm about set with one. I'd easily revist other Unibroue's before trying this again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,scottum,4.35,"Vintage 2002 from my cellar.  Pours a nice deep brown color with a big off-white head which fades to a nice steady fluff. Tastes a bit spicey. This brew is almost a barleywine, but leans towards the Belgian flavors. Yeast does a great job of eliminating the sweet. Mouthfeel is solid and rounds out a very well crafted brew. I enjoy this one aged better than new.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Naerhu,4.6,"Opaque rich amber body with thick creamy tan head. Spicy yeasty nuttiness, pepper and sherbert aromas. Extremely creamy toffee flavor, quite surpising for belgian style. Hugely spice and quite sweet. Alcohol does not hide, nor does it detract. Masterful balance of the hoppy bitterness and the sweetness  Before I drank this, I figured that Unibroue travelled as poorly as my incontenent grandmother, but this lovely beverage, had in Japan, was unbeatable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Trentonator,4.47,"Maudite (translated ""The Damned"") is a DAMN fine beer. If this is what it feels like to be damned, then I am pretty excited about it.

The taste is also damn fine.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,henrysunset,3.46,"Very dark beer, clouded. Served with no real head but delicate lacing remained on the glass. Smell has a hint of sulfur and a ""common beer"" tone, but fancier and refined.. Dare I say the legitimate champagne of regular beers.  Taste is slightly sweet and has a delicate fruitiness to it... More like a liquor then a beer. Very smooth with ligt carbonation.  All and all, drinkable, but a bit too sweet to be balanced in my book.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,shapudding,4.55,"From the tap out poured this beautiful amber goodness into a tulip glass. Creamy white head reduced down to a small ring. Wonderfully scents of spiceyness and sasafrass... so cool! Also smell cream soda...! Wonderful taste... smooth, lightly creamy, not heavy at all. The spices are not too overpowering. Fruity, but again, not too much. Just very, very yummy, and very, very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,FormatKid,4.43,"Im on a real Belgian kick lately, picked up a 12oz of this from Bacchus in Chattanooga. Must mention that this is probably one of the coolest looking bottles Ive seen as well. When I cracked the cap on this it didnt come all the way off and it just started fizzing and leaking down the side, did this for a good minute until I figured it wouldnt stop and just ripped the cap the rest of the way off and dumped it into a goblet. Anyway, it comes out into the goblet with a nice substantial head that fades rather rapidly into a thin soapy layer on top with a ring about the edges. It is a ruddy orangish shade of amber and is hazy to the point where you cannot see through it, nice appearance. Teeny-tiny carbonation bubbles are apparent and remain for the majority of the beer.  Nice vinous character on the nose, strong hints of alcohol. Sweet ripe fruits are apparent in the aroma along with the signature smell of Unibroues yeast. Im picking up on some banana like scents as well.  The taste starts off heavy on ripe delicious apple just like biting into one, and remains throughout the whole experience. The middle adds a rich malty character and sweet, round yeast mustiness. Slight twangs of bitterness at the end and a nutty character is present in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is light, maybe even a touch too light, but that makes this beer dangerously easy going down. A real quaffer especially for the style.  Really looking forward to having this one again, I hope it is available in 750s because Id like a little bigger dose next time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,blitheringidiot,4.28,"On tap at the Drafting Room in Spring House PA. This is a gorgeous dark orange, russet cloudy pour with a tightly packed head. Maybe I am enamored with the tulip glass that adds to this beer's attractiveness. Maudite on tap has a mysterious carbonation bubble pattern that I've never experinced before. The bubbles start an inch below the surface, then rise. Neat!  Licorice root scents with a hint of phenolics and floral scents.  Instant root beer and root beer barrel hard candy erupt. Then some licorice and awl-kee-hawl flavors show up while this 9% ABV warms. Another flavor that I have never noticed in a beer: Pipe tobacco and chewing tobacco notes undercurrent this Maudite.  All there is to say is this beer is going back easily. Can't say that I am getting tired of this one.  Last swigs: Dessert in a tulip glass. Interesting carbonation pattern. Great beer that stands strong and steady with a complexity throughout the entire drink. Quality.  Beer is good. Happy Canadian beering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

Smell:  Yeaaty with extreme hints of fruit & a touch of the 8% alcohol the label promises.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  Reminiscent of a belgium trippel, this is bursting with fruit followed by a smooth malty characteristic that is followed by a mild bitter hops flavor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Rio,3.93,"Dark orange color, almost bordering on a brown. Kinda hazy still, nice thick head upon pouring, that holds on with a thin layer. Good carbonation. A bit of a citrusy smell to it, kinda reminds me of the smell of an orange cleaner.  A mixture of tastes that I can't put my finger on. Seems to have a bit of a fruity taste to it, almost reminds me of an apple cider in the after taste. Strong taste to it, and a strong, full feel in the mouth. The carbonation feel was strong at first, but has tapered off. Almost has a creamy feel to it, like Beamish.  An excellent brew, and my favorite of the Unibroue I've had so far (3 total so far). It's not top notch in my book, but it's definitelly a good one, and one to get again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,AllThingsNinja,4.35,"Maudite is easily my favorite of Unibroue's regular line-up. There's a fire within the reddish orange brew. It burns brightly beneath the lacy, smoky foam. The aroma of oranges and sugars are captivating. The flavors are complex, subtle, and triumphant. the malty sweetness is balanced by citrus notes, an complemented by fruity flavors as well as hints of yeast. It's an excellent, medium bodied, and drinkable beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,travolta,3.21,"Apperance: Frothy, well formed head. Retention is respectable, becomes rocky. Apple cider in color. Lacing is great.  Nose: Lightly herbacious, orange blossom.  taste: Bitter at first, sweet soft crackers, watery and bitter in the end.  Notes: Adding the yeast did not make much of a difference to the taste, it did not add character like it does with other beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Soybomb,4.26,"Appearance: Pours a dark amber to maybe even light brown color with a nice big fluffy begian head on it that leave a nice lacing in the glass.  Smell: Alcohol and spice are the main smells I pick out.  Taste and mouthfeel: Alot of flavors are here, malt and spices really jump out at me. A medium body that has quite a bit of carbonation in it to take it off your palate quickly and with a finish hardly different than the start.  Notes: Great beer even if not my favorite style. I'd drink one again anytime.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Gueuzedude,4,"This beer has an orange-amber-copper hue to it. It is lightly hazy as well, and the head is a pale tan color. A fruity (a combination of apple, pear, and plum), crisp aroma wafts from my glass. It is well carbonated and has a bit of sweetness up front. This beer is quite smooth, there is not much in the way of bitterness or astringency. The taste is fruity as well with notes of apple and pear. This has a nice light refreshing palate to it. This beer has simple flavors, despite this I really like this. There is a hint of astringency in the finish, combined with the prickly carbonation, that balances the sweetness/ fruitiness of this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,littlebibs,4.5,"Maudite: A great beer for Springtime, strong with a Bewitching taste & hopefully I will be savoring this long past the harvest moon.(It would make a great Halloween brew) Highly carbonated, at first, it settles down where its time for this devils brew to take you to darker places. A very complex beer with hints of fruits, bread yeasts, corriander, candie apples, the works I guess. Very delicious, try the apple ale they also make. Great company up there in Canada and they make some great beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,sublimesipping,4.65,"Passion in a glass! This amazing beer holds true to its old world Belgian roots but melds new world panache. A necter of the gods that pours subtle red chocolate, swirling earth tones. Served royally in a goblet. Color a sophisticated, deep, inviting, sexy. Hints of cherry and chocolate. Tastes as would a fine port, belgian chocolate and dried cherry essence with a hint of cracked pepper and anise. Creamy, dark swirls crown if not a king, at least a prince of beers. Mouthfeel is to remember, savor, linger, a warming of the palate and a perfectly balanced sensation of quality and sophistication. This is a beer to create memories by, with, and maybe for. Tres manifique!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,slitherySOB,4.29,"Ahh, Maudite. A beautiful beer from a beautiful brewery. Pours a dark, stained oak or cherry colour. Cherry wood, not fruit. Nice, 2 1/2 finger froth head that clings to the glass. Aroma of bread, poundcake, dark berries, coriander, cloves and candy. Succulently sweet. And delicious. The first taste is a refreshing, thirst quenching gulp, followed by a bittersweet aftertaste. As the beer warms, the darker fruits shine and the sweet cake taste takes a second seat. Smooth, dry and crisp. Another delicious offering from Unibroue. If Sleemans messes with their beer, they shall have an enemy to contend with.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CortexBomb,4.4,"Pours beautiful reddish black with a monster head on it with a strong spice and fruit dominated scent.  Very complicated and quality taste too. Malts are there in abundance, but the spice and fruits from the nose dance about on the tongue, trading jabs with the hops and the accompanying tinge of bitter.  Mouthfeel is good, definitely on the thicker side with a medium coasting, while drinkability on this is also quite good, particularly for having a high ABV: Unibroue seems to be very good at masking the alcohol content of their brews.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,waughbrew,4.9,"A huge beautiful head with R&L. Rusty red with some black creeping in, forboding. Spicy and fruity in the nose with hints of yeast and chocolate, intriguing. Flavor is gorgeous but haunting - strawberry, spice, dark and long. A bit spritzy then smooth. Damn me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CarolinaCardinals,4.5,"Bought a 750 ml bottle at my local AJ's for $6.79. A wee bit on the pricey side but I had to sample another brew from that wonderful brewery known as Unibroue. The appearance is a cloudy orange-red-brown. Poured a decent head that dissapated quickly but left a sticky sweet lacing down the side of my glass. The smell is wonderful, sweet malts with a fruity aroma, mixed with a generous dose of yeast-for the refermentation within the bottle. The taste is very interesting, sweet malts followed by a somewhat dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is very smooth and full. An extremely drinkable beer, good thing I have only one bottle because of the high alcohol content!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dauss,3.87,"750ml corked A belgian strong ale from the Canadian brewery, Unibroue. Pours a cloudy yellowish reddish brown. Specs of yeast floating and oving throughout the glass. Large light yellow-orange head, good staying power and lots of lacing on the glass. First sip, malty, as it warms and lingers on the tongue, hoppy bitterness gets strong fast. No indication of the 8% ABV this brew packs. A lot of carbonation so you can't drink it fast. Very complex beer. Overwhelming for my amateur taste buds.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,WesWes,4.47,"The beer pours a cloudy orangey amber color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is great! It has a nice fruity, yet malty scent that is quite refreshing. It has a rootbeer type yeasty aroma that is really pleasant. The taste is great as well. It is a sweet and malty tasting brew with a nice, refreshingly fruity Belgian style finish. It goes down really easy and is a bit dry on the finish. This beer has great mouthfeel. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine Belgian style beer. It has great mouthfeel and excellent taste; another fine brew from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,DaveGood,4.65,"This is the beer that was my first introduction to Unibroue and definitely one of my favorites.  This beer poured a beautiful reddish/brown color with a fluffy off-white head that slowly dissapated, leaving a thin lace along the sides of the glass. The aroma was full of yeast, giving it an almost bread-like smell, as well as some spices and hops. The taste was quite complex. It began with some fruity malts before giving way to a spicy (peppery) flavor and minimal hops. It was medium bodied and extremely smooth. This beer is remarkably smooth, given the high ABV. This can be dangerous because this is one beer that will definitely leave you wanting more!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jed,3.77,"Presentation: Brown, 33 cl bottle with a devil, some settlers in a canoe, and ""Strong Beer on Lees"" written in two languages on the front. Seriously. Foil cap. The back of the label has information about the beer in German and French, along with suggested serving glassware. Best if consumed by 4/15/06. Poured into a chalice.  Appearance: Pours a warm, reddish brown color. Actually, it didn't pour so much as explode out of the bottle the second it was opened, despite not being shaken or disturbed. Maudite is a fairly cloudy beer, with a small head and average head retention. As the head disappears, it leaves behind a decent amount of lacing. Heavy carbonation.  Smell: The aroma is dominated by spices and spicy alcohol, paired with fruit notes.  Taste: Nose of sweet fruit mixed with dry pepper and similar spices. Middle is a drier, spicy yeast and malt flavors, with some almost sour notes. Finish is dry, with lingering pepper flavors and the same sour, bready aftertaste. Lots of warming alcohol flavors. As the beer warms, a banana flavor becomes more evident. Overall, the nose in this beer is amazing, but the transition to the pepper/sour flavors really hurts the taste.  Mouthfeel: Nice, solid mouthfeel; warm and smooth throughout the entire beer.  Drinkability: While the big, 8% alcohol content is all over the flavor, it's well integrated with the rest of the beer so that you never taste unpleasant, raw alcohol. Nicely balanced within the taste of the beer.  The weakest of the Unibroue beers I've sampled; somehow, the taste on Maudite just seems a bit off. Coupled with the carbonation problems, maybe this one didn't make the trip over to France as well as its brothers. Nevertheless, Maudite is definitely worth trying, although I'll probably stick with Trois Pistoles in the future.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Dogbrick,4.22,"This beer is a clear dark orange color with mild effervescence and a very thick bone white head. Quick lacing. The aroma is fruit (banana mostly), spice, yeast and some hops. Medium-bodied and somewhat complex with a satisfying array of flavors like clove and other spices, fruit, malt and a touch of alcohol. The finish is rather dry and zesty. The alcohol definitely sneaks up on you by the end of the bottle too. Very enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,watermelonman,4.47,"This poured to a pretty plain dark color but it had a nice head. The smell is fruity and alcoholic.  It's a potent beer, that's for sure. The smell and taste are both very nice. It's dangeriously drinkable. The mouthfeel is dark and wonderful.  I think this is a benchmark for the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,GuinnessSmurf,4.38,"The Unibroue Maudite has slowly become one of my favorite beers of all time. This truly unique Belgian Ale has a lot to offer and can be appreciated by experts and novices alike. Here is why:  The beer pours into the glass a deep orange-brown/yellow. The head is big and bubbly, leaving a very impressive appearance on the top of the beer. When the beer settles a bit, you can see sediment in the glass - oh yeh, baby, ""your ingredients are showing!""  There is a lot of alcohol in the smell...some what of a fermented fruity alcohol. And the taste, is...woh, its powerful. Yeh, there is definately a strangely active alcohol flavor for this 8% ABV beer. The flavor is warm though, and allows the mouth to sort of glow with happiness. There are a variety of fruit flavors that seem to come to mind: plums, apples, white grapes.  The aftertaste lasts and lasts - not just in flavor, but your mouth continually senses the passing of the beer - all the way down to your stomach.  This beer is fantastic.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,donnebaby,4.2,"Amazing color on this beer, a deep apricot fading to amber towards the thinner part of the glass. Concentrated small bubbles group up to form a thin screen of foam over the liquid. Smell foretells a strong drink to come, with wisps of alcohol.  A hard apple taste blasts through on the taste, with notes of sweet, icy watermelon. Everything stops quickly, leaving a slight feeling of heat in the throat and the stomach. A little bit rough!  The mouthfeel is fantastic, resembling champagne in its soft bubbliness. The carbonation shocks the mouth and refuses to die.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BCMan,3.92,"I picked up a 750 ml bottle because anything worth doin is worth doin right. It poured up with a big frothy head that faded back to a roing of bubbles cirling the glass. It had a nice amber color that was cloudy. The aroma was a bit weak but I attribute that to the beer being refidgerated at too low of a temperature. The flavor also was a bit small but along with the fragrance it grew as the bottle warmed. The good thing about the larger bottles is that they last long enough for you to get the variations from change in temperature. The taste was spicy with a variety of fruit accents swirling around. The aftertaste was subtle but warmed you inside nicely. I nicely balanced beer. As usual, the broues of Unibroue are very good and definetly worth the money.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,canucklehead,4.6,"I keep coming back to this beer because it one of the best Belgian beer values eventhough it brewed in Quebec. The balance and rounded flavours are what makes this extremely drinkable at 8.0%abv. Fringante, Terrible and other Unibroue beers are bigger and badder but their availability and price do not put them on my table very often. This beer at $5.00 a 750ml bottle is often in my fridge.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,RootedFool,4.37,"Purchased a 12 ounce bottle at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California.  Pours cloudy copper-tinged amber into my brand new Maudite goblet -- how suitable -- with a big fluffy off-white head that falls quickly leaving, surprisingly, no lace.  Smell is of deep, dark and spicy fruits -- raisins and prunes, figs, &#65279;bananas soaked for days in rum and sugar -- fresh bread and a musty alcohol warmth.  Taste opens with some very fruity (berries and alcohol) notes. Spicy, almost chocolate-like malts flow out in the middle. The finish is a swift tingling of hops and alcohol heat on the palate that lasts as long as the time between sips.  Mouthfeel is very light, and has an airy -- like whipped topping -- quality to it. Interesting.  Great way to break in my glass, and a great beer. My second time trying it -- even better now than before.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Phyl21ca,4.5,Bottle - Poured a ruby colored brew with nice huge head with great retention. Carbonation is good and aroma of malts and hops are well balanced. Taste is a right mix of sweetness and spice. Aftertaste has the usual creamy Unibroue feeling with a subtle bitterness. The ABV is so subtle and to me is one of the great quality of this great beer. Probably one of the best Belgian beer brewed outside of Belgium and one of the best from Unibroue.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ALESwhatCURESya,4.29,"This poured a dirty iced tea color, but the aroma sure made up for it. A nice full, sweet, alcohol smell that brings my senses to alert. The head turned into a scattered film with pretty heavy lacing. The taste is very carbonated with an almost sour, but good, taste. The sweetness is balanced out with a dry finish. I still have yet to find anything from Unibroue that I have not loved!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Rastacouere,4.12,"From the 750ml bottle (which seemed a little more stable) Amber/Copper color. Herbal nose of yeasts. It simply tastes good: cloves, pepper, yeasts, hops, malt, fruits and what not. I couldn't find any component taking the top in this delicious rumble that develops a small, but pleasant bitterness as it, not without regrets, leave your throat.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Ellbert,3.56,Appearance: Suprisingly this poured very clear with a very white head. It left a nice white lace till the end of the glass.  Smell: This had a pretty clean smell but it almost smelled stale.  Taste: Very mild and smooth taste. It had some light spiciness to it that made it very intriging. It was a very well balanced flavor.  Mouthfeel: It was a very smooth beer with enough carbonation. Nothing special.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bditty187,4.3,"Clear bronzy-peachy hue, I was very surprised at the color it poured, it was much lighter than I would have expected but it was a beautiful color, the apple-flesh white head reached a finger in height but it faded to a fourth of that size rather quickly. The amount of lacing was disappointingly minimal. The bouquet is, well, yummy to smell. Notes of spiced cake soaked in cola, hints of pepper, faint suggestions of bubblegum and bananas, a vague hint of alcohol as well. The potency is modest but it gets its point across: inviting. The palate has a lot going on, at times the maltiness is very cake-like and yet at other times it is toasted biscuits. When the cake speaks up I noticed the alcohol more, conversely when the biscuits shine I noticed a basket of fruit lead by green apples, bananas, and array of tropical fruit. No matter the malt construction the spiciness is solid throughout, pleasantly peppery. This is obviously a well-crafted beverage. The carbonation is big and forceful, maybe a little too much so, it is around medium in body, I found it just a tickle too thin but not enough to downgrade it. The 8% abv seems very appropriate for this beer, it is big enough to add complexity but low enough to quaff a few, granted you would feel it. Maudite is a highly drinkable beer; it is another winner from Unibroue. I wish I could drink this regularly; I purchased this 750 ml in Kansas City. If you have passed on this one you are a fool, recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,resirob,4.2,"Poured a deep orange mahogany with an ample head that settled to a wide ring. Light lacing throughout the glass. Persistent carbonation.  Aromas of fruit, caramel, yeast, and a bit of spicy phenols (mostly clove). A lot going on here. Alcohol comes through from time to time.  Taste is complex and satisfying. Fruit and caramel get the party started, and then spice and alcohol show up. A bit of hops for balance, and a long warming finish from the alcohol.  Medium-full mouthfeel.  An outstanding brew, and my first from Unibroue. There will be many more",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,necoadam,4,"Poured out an amber/orange with a huge head that settled down eventually. Smell consisted of plums. Also got some lemon in there as well. Various spices and some alcohol as well. Taste reminded me of Ommegang Three Philosphers. It's got that spicy flavor combined with some ripe fruits. Nice taste. Alcohol is kinda masked and warms the throat nicely. Aftertaste was kinda like dead air. There really wasnt a strong malt backbone on this brew, Granted, you can taste it and all, but there's no structure at the end. Just my thought on it. But all in all, a great brew from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jlervine,4.33,"Poured an amber honey color with a fantastic white head. The head disappears slowly into a lump in the middle of the beer and lining the edge of the glass. The smell has a sweet citrusy note to it that does a fair job of masking the alcohol. The taste is ultra-smooth. Notes of raisins, plums, caramel, citrus - but very light on the tongue. Leaves a bit of dryness that succors you into taking that next sip. Bit of additional sweetness as it warms, along with ginger and cinnamon. Very tasty, glad I waited this long before popping the cork. Deceptively tasty, this beer could have me plastered if I wasn't too careful. This beer is my celebratory beer - it shouldn't be too long before I can buy Maudite in my own state, as opposed to driving to Tennessee for it!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Ahhdball,4.42,"Maudite (Damned). What makes someone want to drink a beer that has Satan and a bunch of yahoo's paddling a canoe for a label? I just answered my own question. Obscure deep orange color with a frothy head that perked my nose up to smell fruits, spices, caramel, and a little yeast. Very complex. The taste is outstanding, so may flavors, almost an overload on the palate. Orange, molassas, ginger, and nutmeg, followed by the heavier malt (but blending perfectly) and then settling in to a hoppy after taste. This is great! Legend has it that the men on the cover are being protected by Satan on thier trip home for christmas. I think if I have a few more of these I'll be right with them!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93

A lasting foamy tan head that eventually disapates to some fine lacing.  Smell: Yummy! Caramel malt, with orange rind, yeast, banana, and spice all hopping around.  Taste: Compex, with coriander and pepper, malt, citrus, banana, yeast and an alcoholic fruitiness. These flavors echo on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Creamy with fine carbonation, and a nice weightiness.  Drinkabilty: Surprisingly so, given the ABV, though I suppose that would eventually put me under the table. I'm willing to give it a go though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,edchicma,4,"An all-around fine brew. An unfiltered cider-like appearance, with good lacing. Smell has a fruity note that invites you to drink. Taste was strong on the alcohol, but there were some fruity notes to balance the alcohol presence. Mouthfeel, as I expected it would be, was medium to full, but nice, if you sipped. For the higher abv, drinkability was above average.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,babyhobbes,4.33,"This is my first Unibroue brew and I'm very pleased!  Pours with a good-sized white,creamy head. The beer is a gorgeous orangish, amber color. I smell banana, alcohol and spice. This tastes so good! There banana and spice as well as a strong yeast flavor. This is smooth and creamy in the mouth and matches well with the flavor and scent. It has a crisp non-cloying finish. I would be pleased to drink this all night.  Now I am anxious to try more Unibroue brews.  This is just a great brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,HiroProtagonist,4.13,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip with a lovely off-white head rising up, then falling, leaving scattered lacing. The beer was hazy and nectar-like, with particulates. The color was a gradient of red to orange, starting with red at the bottom moving to orangish near the top, when a small lamp shines from above. The nose was subtle yet complex, with strong notes of yeast and banana, and subtler whisps of alcohol, coriander, orange peel, and vanilla. The beer felt full and fluffy, with flavors of chewy fresh bread and honey malt, and notes of coriander and peppercorns, finishing with a satisfying and well-balanced bitterness. A very satisfying set of flavors and aromatics. I really enjoyed the 12 oz serving, but I could certainly have had another glass, as it wasn't overly sweet. Another winner from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,RocketWidget,4.26,"Not a typical Belgian Strong Dark. Pours an amber yellow with lots o head. Smell is pungent, of some sort of tropical fruit. Very carbonated, taste is much more hoppy than most Belgian strongs, with fruit and malty overtones. An interesting brew, and a good one.  EDIT 7/27/04: I'm reviewing this sucker again from a bottle conditioned 750ml bottle, and I want to improve my review. The pour is incredible, bubbling the whole way down. Taste is outstanding, smooth and complex, sugary and fruity, yet hoppy and spicy. An excellent beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Charthepirate,4.05,"Poured deep brownish, kinda poopy brown. Head was thick and creamy, pour glass so little lacing.  slight banana, malty, belgiany smell.  Flavor is very tasty, but hard to describe. Quick mellow hop flavor followed by a nice maltiness. flavors of cloves, a little banana and wheat. It's tasty but not amazing.  Best part is the mouthfeel which is smooth, creamy, and fizzy.  Good beer, but not my favorite.  Char",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,RockyTopHeel,4.77,"One word: awesome.  Maudite poured a hazy brown-amber, bubbling strongly as if from the depths below, with a thin, off-white head. The aroma was yeasty, with fruity esters and soft, round wheat throughout  One taste: Oh man. Soft, wheat backbone with layer upon layer of soft fruits (banana? peach?), a complexity of malts, and a crisp, dry finish I've grown accustomed to from Unibroue offerings, as well as light touches of spice here and there.  Somehow, Maudite manages to be smooth, complex, creamy, and crisp, all at once.  Simply beautiful. If this is damned, who wants to be blessed?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,filabrazilia,4.3,Pours a hazy orange with a yellow hue. An off white head adorns the beer and leaves a nice sheet of lace on the glass.  There is a hint of malt in the nose with a rich spice and fruit presence.  This is an excellent tasting Belgian style ale. The spicy flaovrs of the yeast balance nicely with the malt. There are elements of fruit in the taste as well.  This is a medium bodied beer that feels good in the mouth. This beer is very smooth.  Maudite is a very drinkable beer with no indication of the 8% alcohol. That could be a problem because this is such a delicious beer that you will want to drink more than one.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Jon,4.11,"Beautiful dark amber/orange color with a structured, lasting head that leaves great trails of lace down the glass.  Aroma takes a while to open up, but once it does, notes of yeast, ripe dark fruit, some citrus and caramel become prevalent.  Herbaceous, orange notes loom in the flavor department, all while being accompanied by yeasty, peppery notes. Inviting and ever-changing, this is a very flavorful brew.  Highly carbonated, yet extremely smooth and attractive mouthfeel. Almost unparalleled, but quite indicative of Unibroue's offerings.  Quite drinkable considering its alcohol content, which is very well-masked. Well done.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,AtLagerHeads,4.03,This lovely brew had an enormous off-white head as it came out of the tap. The head caps the deep amber body; it did not disappear as it continued to leave nice sheets of lace.  A decent aroma that hinted of spice under the nice caramel malt that dominated.  Great flavor that was surprisingly lighter than expected and gave hints of spice as from a wheat beer. Very smooth and creamy body that finishes with nice crispness.  Decent drinkability from the nicely balanced blend of attributes.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Zorro,4.25,"First bottle was bad, here is the correct review it deserves.  Pleasant slightly cloudy brown beer, looks tasty. Good amount of carbonation, but not too much.  Smells sweet and of dark ripe fruit. Spicy smells too, and apples, grapes and black pepper. Lively and peppy.  Tastes milder than it smells; a bit drier than you would expect. This is a well-blended brew and a good choice if you want a drier Belgian Ale. Has a distinct mild hop taste. This is a beer that keeps delivering new flavors as you drink it. Alcohol is completely hidden.  Mouthfeel is just about right.  VERY drinkable, packs a punch though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,allboutbierge,4.37,"Sampled from several of the big bottles.  Huge and aromatic head grows on top of an turpid body of brown, orange, and red colors. No light gets through but its not really all that dark of a beer. Numerous fruit aromas, i.e. pears, apples, oranges, etc fill the air along with other aromas of wheat and other scents I couldnt put a finger on. Flavor is just as complex. My buddies and I didnt really agree on the taste but I felt that strong flavors of cherries and other bittersweet fruit flavors were most dominant. Other strong flavors include figs as well as a general bitterness which makes the flavor all that much harder to describe. Extremely complex. Mouthfeel is chewy, full, and assertive. A bottle is just a little less than a meal.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,far333,4.32,"Hazy apricot color with a low and lingering foamy beige head. Aroma is strong and sweet, full of pear and apple, plus cinammon and sweet candy. Mouthfeel is full and chewy. Flavor is big and rich, and envelopes the whole mouth. It's sweet and fruity and yeasty, but falls just shy of being too much. Sweet malts make themselves known, and a crisp hop tingle vibrates the tongue in the finish and lingering aftertaste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,FranklinPCombs,3.9,"Very cloudy, looks just like apple cider. Decent head which retreats quickly into a thin sheet, leaving a dripping lace which does not stay. Smell is very sweet and fruity, with definate aromas of apple and mango, and a slight hint of mustard, with the spices and malts beneath. Taste is again very fruity with baked apples and spices, with a subtle malt background, and a little sharp hoppiness. There is a flat taste to this beer, but not in a bad way. The mouthfeel is very carbonated with tiny bubbles, but nice and crisp. Feels just about an 8% ABV so the drinkability is decent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Crosling,4.29,"Poured a hazy golden orange with a thin but large belgian head. Nice retention throughout the entire session. Lacing was very inconsistant and conflicting. Some swallows it would stick wonderfully and some it would slip back into the beer.  Nice aroma on this brew. The nose was hit with spicy peppers, clove, malts, raisins, herbs and yeast. A pleasure to inhale.  Nice flavor as well. Very smooth and well balanced especially for being 8%. Nice flavors of lemon, orange, clove, yeast, coriander and peppers. Alcohol was very very well hidden and the warming effect in the mouth led to an excellent mouthfeel. The initial taste was excellent, the mid-palate was great but then on the finish this beer seemed to die on me, keeping it from a perfect 5 for taste.  Overall a very solid offering. Unibroue knows what the hell they are doing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,SetarconeX,4.4,"Odd looking little beer. Comes out a strange dark tan color, with a hint of...green? Decent head, seemingly held up by an impressively long lasting carbonation. Smell is sweet, fruity, and quite malty. Few surprises, it tastes very much like it smells. Mouthfeel, however, is nice, slick, and wonderful, much more so than a lot of other Belgians, which tend to tingle oddly.  Quite possibly the most drinkable of Unibroue's line I've had yet, and they've got some tasty little bottles. As an added bonus, the label design is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Very much recomended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,CharlesRiver,4.38,"I had this on tap at Anam Cara. Served in it's own glass, nice touch.  Cloudy Tan in color with a nice white head that just seems to last. The draft version seems to be less carbonated as the bottle that I had. The smell is sweet and spicy with a hint of something peppery. Very explosive in the mouth. Smooth and sweet in the beginning, spicy in the middle and grassy at the end. The alcohol comes in to play at the end as I get that warming feeling.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BierManVA,3,"750 ml corked bottle.  Not overly impressed at all. Bier is lacking in carbonation. I had to force a good head by extreme pouring and then it disappeard very quickly.  Likewise, the taste is bland and uninspiring. A little fruit and alcohol. That's it!  Perhaps this bier is too fresh and requires a lenghthy stay in a cellar, and if that is the case, they shouldn't have sold it.  By the way, I purchased two bottles of this recently at different times and both were 'the same'. It is possible that a bad batch has been released. I will take note to give this another shot in a few months as I general enjoy this style very much and other Unibroue products I've had are great.  John",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,NJpadreFan,3.1,"Maudite comes in a cool bottle!!  -Maudite pours a hazy/cloudy orange with a thick head. -Smell is wheaty!? A hint of floral, spice, and fruit?! -Taste is a smooth Belgium Ale flavor with some spices and an undefinable fruity flavor.  -Mouthfeel is very smooth actually pleasant. goes down easy no bitterness or lousy aftertaste.  Overall, it's a bland beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mschofield,4.2,"Very bubbly with a huge head, frothy and rocky, even in a goblet as recommended. Slightly hazy red-gold, away from the light it's a deep red. Spicy and fruity on top of a doughy aroma Fruity taste - cherry and apple? Spicy (alcohol pepper, with other spice), slightly tart. Very smooth, medium feel, very drinkable especially for the ABV, too bad it's only in 4 packs.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,GreatPondBrewer,3.11,"I was very dissapointed by this beer. Especially since I doubt it is very easy to find on tap and was stoked to see it at the Old Toad.  Poured a cloudy brownish orange with a fairly decent tan head that laced here and there. Smell was very indistinct with a grainy, nose full of barnyard smells such as dried grass or hay. Taste was a tad fruity with perhaps some dried apple or fig, and more of that spent grain taste. Alcohol was not very apparent at any point. Mouthfeel was decent but nothing to write home about. This beer seems a bit phoned-in compared to the other things I have had from Unibroue. What a pity.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,merlin48,4,"Pours a murky honey gold, with a nice head. Moderate lacing. Mango and hay on the nose. Creamy and smooth in the mouth, and taste is of medium sweet malt, dried apricots, mild carbonation, and a pleasant pear finish. Conceals the alcohol quite well. Very well balanced and pleasantly drinkable.  I love their mythical labels, but wish they would get rid of that satanic devil character.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jdhilt,3.9,"Another very good beer from Unibroue, cloudy amber apperance, nose has a hint of raisins but good carbonation and four fingered frothy head that leaves a fair lace. On the sweet side but just barely. High ABV but no alcohol burn. $4.99 for a 750ml bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,beernbbq,4.3,"The real deal. Even though this is an ale and not a dubbel, I found it had similar charcteristics to the Chimay Reserve. Plummy, raisin-y, sweet but not cloyingly so. Easy to drink, a great alternative to champagne. Keep it at cellar temp for pure enjoyment.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dpend,4.1,"Appearance is a slightly murky amber.Aggressive head was large and made a good amount of fizz as it dissipated.Created nice lacing and retained a small cover film.Smell and taste was of malts and wheat with a bit of citrus undertones.Highly drinkable for an 8% beer, but the carbonation may get to some after awhile.This seems a typical trait in the Unibroue line.Another fine brew by them.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,HappyHourHero,4.3,"Really thick whiteish tan head. Left a little bit of lacing. Glowing light brown to amber in color. The smell is intriguing. Creamy apricots, a bit of aclohol, a pinch of spice. Light fruity malt flavor combines with a slightly bitter and alcoholic taste. There's even flavor on the exhale. Smooth body combined with a solid amount of carbonation make for great mouthfeel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Foxman,4.2,"Out of the bottle it's a cross of amber and orange, just a bit hazy, though maybe that's from the excessive chill I laid on it. Creamy head out of the gate, that settles back, then slicks the top throughout the sipping, leaving lacy tracks down the inside of the glass. It's got a yeasty tang to the nose, reminiscent of rising dough. The fruits come through at the front of the flavor, with apples coming to mind. A little lighter than I expected the first time I had it, as I for some reason figured on a heavier coat on my tongue and mouth. Emminently drinkable, but the ABV sneaks up on you, so for me two's the limit if I expect to be doing anything before 10 the next morning.  The label's dark, almost Gothic in its way, but fun, not unlike the beer the bottle holds. Certainly something to expose friends to who've at least cut their teeth on a Chimay.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,DagFishHead,3.63,"Appearance: Hazy, apple-cider, amber-brown body. Brisk carbonation (the bottle popped when the cap seal broke). Lush, voluminous, off-white head fades to a persistent 1/4"" that holds on. Creamy foam lace. Smell: Sweet malt, tangy yeast. Citrus, clove. Taste & Mouthfeel: Rich honey, caramel, toffee malt with toasted notes. Followed by a tangy yeast and carbonation tingle, finishing with a very crisp and dry citrus/hop pucker. ABV hides very well offering a soothing background warmth. Carbonation faded from very high to noticeably low in a fairly short time. Drinkability: Quite drinkable for a sweet, high ABV beer. Overall, not as good as I expected, but I will come back and try this again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,grynder33,4.3,"To me , Unibroue is one of the best breweries in the world. They seem incapable of making a bad beer.My Maudite erupted out of my bottle, and after cleaning up,I noticed a cloudy orange red apperance, an intriguing sweet spice aroma,a taste that first reminded me of Duval, fruity orange rind, apple, all kinds of spices, smooth warming in the tummy, left you with a nice fresh breath. Another Unibroue masterpiece.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,PiratePete,4.25,"Poured a dark amber with a light brown head that settled down and covered the brew. Wonderful nose of malt and fruits. Everybody comments on the scotch taste and its true. It is very predominant. What a wonderful, and long lasting, aftertaste. Very warm yet alive. What can I say about a beer with so many reviews except: This was a darn good beer. Try it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,rdrummer,3.7,"This entry from Unibroue pours a medium amber color with very little head and no lacing. It has a malty, yeasty aroma with some undertones of spice like cinnamon. It has a nice taste with some citrusy, but sweet flavors. There is a hint of maltiness and a nice finish that tastes like some of the better Belgians. The mouthfeel is very rich and toney. It is a drinkable beer somewhat above average, but if I had my choice of Unibroue brews, I would pick both Le Fin du Monde and Trois Pistoles over this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BierReise,3.92,"Burnt orange/amber colored and a bit hazy. Very little head, just a slight white film floating on top. Very nice and attractive aroma of berries and sweet malt with a definite yeast undertone. Sharp crisp mouthfeel and not quite as smooth as some of the top Belgians I've had. Flavor is on the sweet side and malty with a sugary end. Decent beer that I've overlooked. Definitely worth a re-visit. Thanks to JohnnyDuvel for throwing one my way.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mntlover,4.3,"Nice light amber color with nice head that stays all the way to the last drop. Lots of carbonation my beer had constant stream of bubbles rising but never tasted over carbonated.  Sweet fruity aroma bananas, raisons? with touch of spice thrown in. Tastes wonderful, malty, sweet, fruity excites the mouth with slight hops on the way down.  Mouthfeel was wonderful I could drink this all day long. Would never have know it had 8% abv if not for the label. Was a wonderful brew sorry that I now have only 3 left. Was my first Unibroue definitely will not be the last.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Shiloh,3.68,"This was a very pretty offering on arrival. The colour had very light cranberry tinge with a crown that was close to two fingers and a wide spread glass cling that did not stop. The body was medium as was the carbonation. Aroma was lightly of assorted fruits, predominantly bananas. Taste was interesting but not appealing. Seemed to me as it had a sweet maple quality to it with a light bitter back.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,OldFrothingSlosh,4.47,"12oz. foil-wrapped bottle. What appears to be a best before date of 1/15/03 on the back.  Appearance: Pours a very...different color. A ruby-tinged apple cider best describes it. Very active and *fizzy* head quickly settes to a ring around the very outside of the glass. Lots and lots of impossibly small bubbles boil up from the glass.  Smell: Spicy, dark fruit, doughy sweetness dance across the nostrils. Complex? Indeed.  Taste: The aromas give a hint as to what will be happening with this beer when it hits the taste buds. Ripe bannanas, pepper, honey up front. Finished with a dash of bitterness to go with a slight ""bannana peel"" flavor on the palate. Alcohol only noticed after it had warmed considerably and then only as a supporting role.  Mouthfeel: The tight carbonation along with the zip from the hops at the end make for a great mouthfeel.  Drinkability: The unique flavor, appearance, and finish make for a continuous ""hand-to-mouth"" action with the glass. Excellent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,silks636,4.32,"Poured from 750ml brown bottle. Caged and corked. Best before date stamped on label. Served very slightly chilled.  Pours deep amber with a frothy white head. Quite hazy. Vigorous carbonation and small yeast particles are observed. Nose is filled with alcohol esters, fruit, spices, and yeast. Taste starts off with a bready malt that quickly morphs into a tangy apple fruitiness. Hops are present, but not intrusive. Peppery spices slip in next... clove and cinnamon come to mind. Finishes off very dry with a nice tart cidery end. Mouthfeel is very crisp with nice carbonation that accentuates the spiciness.  Absolutely stunning. She is deceptively strong too... checks in at 8%, but hardly tastes like it. My first experience with Maudite, although I have thoroughly enjoyed other beers from Unibroue. After tonight I plan on keeping a few bottles of this fantastic brew on hand at all times.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ChrisBowers,4.52,"What an excellent beer. I had this Belgian Strong Ale on tap, believe it or not. It was at Sean Bolan's in Baltimore and I've never seen it anywhere else on tap. Pours a cidery amber similar to Ressurrection Ale. Hints of cloves and maybe a little plum are evident in the smell. Taste is excellent with a rich fulfilling mouthfeel. One thing I did not like about this beer was that while it was balanced while cold, surprisingly it became slightly unbalanced as it warmed up, as is usually the opposite with more Belgian style beers. There's an easy way to fix this though... drink it cold and order another! Be careful though, those who do not respect this beer will be feeling it in the morning at 8% ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Elemental,4.29,"Appearance - probably the only dissapointing thing about this beer. Its advertised as a Belgian Strong Amber Ale but it pours more like a cidery brown color. There is a thin amount of head.  Smell - Great aroma with hints of spices and fruits. The fruitiness is very strong but not overpowering.  Taste - Very fruity and spicy taste. Big and malty, slightly tast and bitter. Almost cidery taste but great note overwhelming.  Overall - Damn good, a must try!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,yankeeheel,3.58,"Poured from a 750ml bottle with a ""use by 2006"" date on it. Got that covered. Pours a very hazy brown/orange, almost appears like apple cider when held to light. Short lived head with almost no lacing.  The smell is strongly of apple, clove, nutmeg, biscuit and alcohol. The taste I found a little lacking. Sure it was complex, but it just came across as very...I don't know...flat? I got the fruit kick up front with the spice, pepper, and alcohol at the end, but it all seemed to blend in to one, and not in a exceedingly pleasurable way. The yeast made for a nice body and mouthfeel, yet I expected more?  Overall an intersting brew but it didn't quite leave me with the out-of-body experience that some other BA's have had. Maybe I need to snag another bottle and let it cellar for a few years.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,steelreign,4.25,"Only the ABV prevents this from being my favorite session brew. Outstanding, creamy and well balanced mouthfeel, along with a nice fruity palate with no bitterness makes for one helluva brew. A nice warming all the way down.

22,33,moulefrite,4.33,"Another delight from this awesome brewery. Always over the top, and always very drinkable!! Color is a lovely deep honey with a golden brown core. Aromatics include sweet toffee and banana cream pie. In the mouth the beer is creamy, intense and alcohol laden, with a real knack for warming things up. Plenty of ultra ripe banana, and an ineffable fruitiness on the palate. This is one hell of a sipper! Drink this without respect and you'll pay the devil! You'll be one of those poor lost souls rowing towards the bowels of hell in an overcrowded row boat (as noted on the label)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Andreji,4.58,"And yet another truly fantastic beer by Unibroue, I'm amazed, no wonder the spot on the list.  Pours a mysterious dark caramel tone that becomes progressively darker from the bottom of the glass to the top, where one encounters a small, white/grey head that fizzes until disappearing into a ring with no lacing. Opaque, cloudy. inviting.  The smell, Ascending from a strong wheat into a fruity, lemony perception with the side smells ranging from a bit of alcohol and yeast, and some, very slight hops.  The taste, fantastic. A wheat base unveiled as the carbonation passes blends gradually into an enchanting lemony feel that slightly sweet and combined with a bit of alcohol, fades into a slight bitterness by the hops to conclude the experience.  The mouthfeel, just a bit nasal thanks to the alcohol, but very soft and yet with a nice, crisp body.  &gt;&gt;&gt;Why I preferred Trois Pistoles: Similar, but stronger taste. better hidden alcohol. both fantastic anyways.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Boilermaker88,4.33,"Presented in a 750ml brown bomber with a ""best before"" date of 08-28-05. Poured a cloudy brown color with a presistent off-white head and a large amount of carbonation boiling up to the bottom of the head. Smell is rich of malt and peppery spice. Slight alcohol aroma wafts from my glass after aggitation (not me, the glass). Taste is of bready malt, pepper, coriander, a hint of vanilla and a nod to banana and clove. Wonderfully complex blending of flavors. Feel is rich, full and dry. Really fills the mouth. A well crafted, delicious beer that delivers a variety of tastes. Another brew I'd like to use as a charter member of my soon-to-be ""cellar"" (read: closet).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,xgrigorix,4.25,"Twelve ounce brown twist cap. Best by date clearly marked on back label.  Pours tawny amber in colour, clear with a gigantic creamy & dense off white head. Yeast pour turns it cloudy as expected, nothing really remarkable about it.  Wonderful aromas of spices, & some herbs. Bright & inviting. Aroma is dulled by the yeast pour.  Rich malt flavours, some orange, with an interesting blend of coriander and pepper. The slightest hint of bannana with vanilla, & then a dry finish that lingers. Yeast pour adds a bread like quality, while muting some other flavors.  Slightly thicker than medium bodied with a nice carbonation.  Well done. I prefered this without the yeast. To each their own.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,RoyalT,4.38,"Appearance  This pours a beautiful, thick cloudy brown. The head was full and left some lacing.  Smell  Big malt and spicy yeast aromas fill the nose. This is a terrific smelling brew, full of caramel and fruit scents.  Taste - The first hint of hops is quickly replaced by huge malt and caramel flavors. The body is very deep, mature, raw, and spicy, with a complex fruity boldness of predominantly banana and clove-spiked apple. Theres also a presence of alcohol and many other flavors that I cant pinpoint.  Mouthfeel  Lively carbonation slowed this one down a bit. I thought it was a little too much for the style. But, its a full-bodied ale that you can sip, suck, chew, or pack in between your cheeks and gum like a wad of tobacco.  Drinkability  This went down smooth as silk.  Comments  This is my idea of a BSDA. I chose this for my 100th beer review to commemorate the occasion.  Update  Well, I had this for my 100th review and now, here I am, over a year later, with 1,220 reviews. I thought Id give this one another full tasting and see how my opinion of it withstands the test of time.  I didnt see a need to elaborate on the Appearance: its perfect. The aroma and taste are damn near perfect. I didnt get any hops this time around but thought the huge butter flavor was just a bit much. Keep in mind that Im trying to differentiate here between a 4.5 and a perfect 5.0.  The style allows for high carbonation. Having said that, I thought this was just a bit too much. Ill say now that it is not quite full-bodied, although the beautiful and full flavors probably demand it to be so. All in all this is one of my favorite BSDAs. I stand by my overall 4.5 rating that I gave this back in August 2003.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,tar,4.3,"Pours a nice cloudy, amber with a thick, foamy, slightly off-white, and very persistent head. The smell is fairly mellow but full of different aromas, especially those of spices and flowers. Very nice complex taste--especially fruity and spicy (peppery in particular). Finishes quite dry. A rather smooth beer and rather easy drinking despite the high alcohol content. This is definitely a beer I will look forward to having again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ManekiNeko,4.47,"Served slightly chilled in an actual Maudite glass (I'm a dork, what can I say). Poured from a 750 mL corked and caged bottle.  Appearance: Burnt umber liquid that is slightly hazy. Quickly forms an offwhite head that dissappates just as fast to a thin layer.  Aroma: Clove and coriander with fruity (I got peach and banana) and malty aromas quite prominent. Little snap of lemon at the end.  Taste: A good wallop of the aforementioned spices rounded out by the malt sweetness. Slight feel of alcohol and bitterness as the liquid lingers on the palate.  Mouthfeel: Warming and just so slightly puckering. Quite refreshing.  Drinkability: Smooth despite the infernally high ABV. Damnation never tasted better.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,beerguy101,3.85,"Medium brown color, small head. Heavy malts and hops, malts are slightly sour and spicy. Large body. Mouthfeel is fluffy (carbonated). Finish is spicy and slightly sweet. Aftertaste has an almost perfume-like sweetness to it, yet slightly sour and bitter. Very different beer",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,NeroFiddled,4.42,"A slightly hazy deep-amber body reveals golden highlights when held to the light; and it's tall, foamy, white head holds exceptionally well and maintains a solid 1/2"" or so throughout the glass. The nose displays crisp, fresh-cut apples and soft, sweet vanilla with a delicate backing of spicy/peppery yeast characteristics. It's just a touch creamy and very smooth across the palate with a very-fine and gently effervescent carbonation accentuating its medium body. The flavor exhibits some fruity toffee and lightly candyish/slightly toasty malt; and it finishes a bit honeyish. The alcohol rises a bit at mid-swallow, and it finishes short and dry. Quite good; although I think I'd prefer a well-aged 750 ml bottle to a fresh draft or 12 oz. bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,beergeek279,4.32,"Served in the 12 oz. bottle. The color is dark amber, with good head. The smell was very flowery and fruity. The taste is very sugary, flowery sweet, with hints of malt to it. The mouthfeel is somewhat heavy. Drinkability-wise, even though it's so sweet, I could have a few more.  This is probably (as of now) my 2nd favorite Unibroue after Fin du Monde. An excellent beer, and probably better than a lot of the dubbels actually from Belgium. Salut Unibroue!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,woemad,4.37,"Had a bottle at the Viking. This is a very cool looking beer, as it comes in a bottle graced by a flying canoe and with Satan himself making an appearance. It poured a dark mahogany with red tinges and with a big head. The first whiff I got reminded me of some sort of perfume. This is easily the most fragrant beer I've ever encountered. I also nosed a peppery aroma. This beer tasted very complex, beginning with a fragrant, fruity taste, and ending with a peppery finish. I don't think it would make a good session beer, as its just too assertive, but its definitely a beer to seek out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Sixpack595,4.33,"I tried this right after a Rochefort 8, and I was shocked. This beer was better in nearly every aspect. The aroma was bready, spicy, and to a lesser degree fruity. Taste was more of the same with black pepper, apples, and others playing bit parts.  Maudite: 750ml for $5.99  Rochefort 8: 330ml for $5.99  Maudite was better, cheaper, and easier to find. Both are good beers, but Maudite will get much more fridge space.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,JISurfer,4.15,"This is another great brew from the fine brewers at Unibroue. You gotta love the name, which in english translates to ""the damned"". Oh, how devilishly good that sounds. It doesn't disappoint either. The rich color to the body somewhat resimbles a jar of my grandpaw's fig preserves. The head stood around for a little while, but died out to a laceing, due to the carbonation. That was the only reason the apperance didn't get a 5 in my book. The taste was similar to any basic Belgian, but it was just a tad to carbonated tasteing for my likeing, but nothing too bad. I would suggest this to anyone looking for a cheap version of a Belgian. Gotta give it to those Canucks.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TripelJ,4.4,"Now Quaffing: Maudite  Presentation: 12 oz. black foil topped bottle that looks like it would be served at the gates of hell.  Ahhh sweet Maudite, surely I am ""damned"", but oh how I love thee. Pours a deep translucent ruby with a medium head that is quick to recede. Color is a deep ruby/amber, more of a dubbel than a 'strong dark ale'. Aromas are sweet--raisins and ripe berries. Taste is sweet up front with a slight bite from the carbonation and alcohol. Hints of raisins and cranberries with an interesting sweetness that melts away to a nice sourness--maybe ripe dark cherries.  Overall: This is a beer to be revered and imitated, but overall just respected. Definitely belgian in style, but Canadian in origin, kudos to Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ALEBOY,4.65,This beer makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. From its' lovely murky brown appearance that is inter-laced with red. Through to its warm inviting flavours that remind me of caramel topping on top of fresh vanilla ice-cream. A true delight.  A big shame that I am writing this from notes as it is sadly no longer available in Australia.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,pootz,4.72,"My first foray into the the Unibrou line up of upscale brews. I am pleasingly surprised. One seldom sees this in the Ontario brew pubs but it's got shelf space on the brewers distributor store chain, which is a good as it is always well conditioned before sale. This brew will actually store up to 6 years and improve as it is a bottle fermented brew....thus the higher alcohol count.  My brew came in a date marked brown bottle complete with eye catching artwork on the label; a crossed armed devil and a flying Voyageur canoe....cool!  The beer pours a murky mahogany color with a wonderful light tan creamy head that caps the beer for quite a while and then reduces to a lace that clings to the side of the glass.  Smells of spices, musty fruits and grains. Starts very smooth and mellow follwed by a very full bodied mouth feel punctuated with sweet nutty tatstes mixed with spices and finishes smooth with a lingering hint of banana...followed by a very warming feel. I saw this describd once as a very complex tatste, that's Maudite oK. ....go figure, I thought all these adjectives were pretentious bogus stuff...but these are all I can use to describe this great brew!  Try it you find it ...or go out of your way to get some if you like drinking beer with good food...this will go well with pasta or red meat (stews) very well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,hotstuff,2.99,This beer poured a large white head with small sized bubbles. The body was cloudy and the hue was light brown.I could definitely taste the alcohol with this beer.About all I have to say about this beer is that it was just okay.I was not extremely impressed by the taste.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Mustard,3.94,"Presentation: 12oz. brown bottle with ""best before"" date -- in this case 09-19-05 -- on the back; $7.99/4 pack from the Beverage Warehouse in Culver City; freaky little label of a ten-man canoe rowing itself at the sun and a gaunt-jawed Satan grinning underneath; second beer of the evening -- comes after a 12 ouncer of Ruedrich's Red Seal pale ale.  Appearance: Pours a foggy brown with a healthy tinge of orange; 1/2"", macro-bubbled, off-white head which quickly recedes; light, unprincipled lacing.  Smell: Thick malt with notes of non-citric fruit, bubble gum and spicy phenol; other stuff is undoubtedly in there as well, but my nose just isn't delicate enough.  Taste: Heavy malt sweetness and a stinging spiciness are Maudite's primary flavor characteristics -- both of these I dig. For the spiciness, xlperro suggests (among other things) ginger ... and I tend to agree. Secondary tastes include a floral hoppiness, bubble gum and alcoholic phenols.  Notes: A big, tasty Belgian style SDA (strong, dark ale) which would rate a lot higher -- for me -- if its bubble gum characteristics were more subdued; Mustard doesn't like spicy hubba-bubba qualities in his beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Indybeer,4.32,"750ml bottle. Poured a hazy golden orange color, with a massive head that stuck around, and lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is almost that of a hefe-weizen. Taste is malty and sweet, with some spice, and a slighty bitter finish. Again the flavor of a good german hefe is in there. Moderate carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel, make this a very good drinking beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,IronDjinn,4.4,"Thought I'd use something special to earn my mug. Poured from a hefty 750ml brown bottle, with a cool gothic Francophone label. Colour is a deep amber with some suspended particles, decent foamy head. Aroma is complex, sweet and toasted malt, cirtus tones, bitter orange peel, some coriander, hint of pepper, even some bubble gum. Flavour hits you like a velvet canoe paddle, nothing subtle about it. Malt is quickly over-run by the spiciness, yet different flavours roll onto the tongue, wave upon wave, a little too quickly to pick them all out seperately. Finishes with pepper however. Surprisingly smooth for an 8% beer, sometimes it pays to be ""damned"".",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,taez555,4.3,"12oz bottle.  This beer poured a huge white head that took it's time dieing down. The body was a translucent light brown/orange/tan.  The nose had a alot of phenol smells. Hinting at almost a german hefe more than a belgian attempt. I could make out some fruity smells as well. Nothing overlly distinct, some plums, raisins maybe even some grapes.  The taste of this beer was very malty and sweet. Classic belgian dark triple ale taste but kicked up a notch by some darker malts. Yet again, lots of very mellow hints of fruit, plums and raisins. A very smooth alcohol burst and presence acompanied by some very subdued hop, earth almost piney sort of taste.  It really didn't have a strong lasting finish, but finished smooth and full of flavor.  Overall I really enjoyed this beer. An amazing belgian style beer from Canada. My favorite so far from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,granger10,4.28,"This is quite a complex Belgian. It poured smooth with a lovely head to match. The aroma told me it would be very fruity with some alcoholic tones in it. Though it was a pleasant smell the taste actually differed in depth and quality. I did notice the sweet sugary taste come through but this beer offered much more. There was a definite peppery spice that gave this beer a little kick. I picked up on some caramel malts and also a woody flavor. There were enough hops to back up this sweet drink, but they weren't too bitter which I liked. It finished tarty and a tad too dry and yeasty for my liking. But this is definitely a fine brew from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,oberon,4.17,"Man I relly like this ""big"" beer,pours a deep amber with a nice thick off-white creamy head,nice sweet almond/caramel smell with slight alcohol notes.A malty,nutty tasting beer with some fruity hints in the finish ( a long finish at that).Very warming something to drink before bed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Loki,4.44,"Sampled from a 12oz bottle.  Pours a deep amber with an off-white, froathy head that leaves sheets of lacing on the glass.  Aromas of sweet malt with hint of caramel, honey, fruit flavors like pineapple or some other sweet fruit and then a generous does of spice with hints of hops that balance the flavor well. This brew had my taste buds dancing and bewildered. Truly wonderful and maybe a little to complex for my taste buds to pull each flavor out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheDM,3.7,"The aroma of this brew was hard for me to make out. It's initial pour yeilded a envigorated head of small white bubbles that left no lacing and has acloudy light breon color. My first taste had an initl uh oh reaction but later settled into flavor that I could not identify. Not sure how to rate the taste of this brew. Not a bad taste, but not great. After a while I could taste the alcohol content of this brew. Perhaps 3 good brews in a night is too much for good ratiings! Hmmmm....",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,daledeee,4.15,"Is this Belgian beer? No but it might as well be.  Pours a nice coppery color with head that stays around and keeps the lace.  I can smell vanilla and banana with malt. Taste is exceptional Good carbonation and bite. Fruit such as grapes and plums,malt and sweetness are prevalant in this one.  This is one of those beers that is way too drinkable for a strong one. I live in Iowa and can't wait for it to be sold here. This is one of the best beers availiable. Imported or exported.  Note: 10-08-08 This beer comes across as a little dry with not as much depth. Still a good one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jcalabre,3.38,"Originally sampled on 4 August 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. Appearance: This beer has a dark orange color. It is opaque. Flavor: It is slightly sweet and the alcohol is well hidden, which I always appreciate. I want to taste the flavors in the beer, not the alcohol. All in all, it's a very nice drinkable beer",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Darkale,4.17,"Nutty and yeasty aroma. Deep and subtle with a backbone of spice.  Color is a dark butterscotch, swirly, with a thin, light tan head.  Taste is malty at first, then sharp and peppery, with good carbonation. Very chewy and foamy in the mouth, with a slick, burning aftertaste. More creamy than I would have thought likely, which makes this a very drinkable beer. The maltiness at first is creamy, then it becomes slick and peppery, with a candy sweetness around the edges.  Another great beer from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,SheepNutz,4.35,"I had this one in a 12oz. bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip-style glass. It pours a deep red with 2 fingers of head that die quickly. There is no lacing left on the glass at all. There is an aroma of fruit and spice, with just a bit of honey. The smell really lures you in. The taste is a bit of fruit, maybe some cherry, with some cloves and a tiny bit of yeast. There is just the right amount of hops too. The mouthfeel is strong, but a little bubbly. Even at 8%, this is very drinkable and nice on a cool spring evening.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Popsinc,4.47,"Appearance: Cloudy amber/dark orange. Huge frothy head. Plenty of active carbonation. A very lively pour even though the head doesn't hold up forever.  Smell: Big and malty. Plenty of spice in the nose. Hints of some fruit and underlying sweetness. There are earthy qualities as well.  Taste: Dark and rich maltiness. Complex fruit & spice flavours are present throughout. Noticeable hints of clove and maybe a pinch of cinamon. Dark fruitiness with sweet hints of caramel. Some woody notes as well. Great body and pleasant balance. A dry, earthy finish with some tartness and a warm alcohol kick.  Mouthfeel: Lively and fresh. Plenty of carbonation and sparkling qualities. Smooth out towards the end.  Drinkability: A great, full beer. I could drink this almost anytime, unless the weather is too hot. This is one of my personal favorites. One of Unibroue's absolute best.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,brewdlyhooked13,3.71,"My only two Belgian glasses are Maudites, so it is high time I actually drink a Maudite from one of them. Ridiculous head, 3+ fingers. In ESPN's Stuart Scott terms, it was stupid big. I had to pause for a minute or two before I could pour the rest in. Kind of a dirty orange color with flakes of sediment in the head and body, reminiscent of Westie12. Head retention is solid with a big lump of foam in the middle.  Yeasty aroma and initially lots of spice, but that tames down after the initial vapors disperse. Still, it has kind of a peppery 'nose feel', tickles a bit on the smell.  Taste has a solid malty presence up front, intensified by the alcohol level. Spicy and bubbly, a nice combination, and a bready taste towards the end. Also more malt notes as well and it gets sweeter towards the end, fruitier.  Mouthfeel is substantial, pleasantly smooth, more than adequate for the style, gives it a little more credibility.  Drinkability - on one hand, the high alcohol detracts a bit, but then again, it is decent enough on all fronts to make it a good, if not potent, session brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jeffboo,4.12,"A nice reddish brown with heavy cream colored head, this brew smells of candi brown sugar,citrusy hops, and bready yeast, a complex swirl of aromas. The beer starts off brown sugar with a toasted malt balance and a light citrus hop in the backround. The tiny bubbles makes for a light body that floats in the mouth. A nice after dinner brew but not as complex as some of their other offerings.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,nomad,4.35,"Poured an ice tea color, a red-orange with a dull glow. Had a big off-white foamy head, healthy amounts of carbonation, and not much lace.  Smelled of the trademark Unibroue yeast, raspberries, tart apples, bread, all with a vinuous edge. Taste was creamy-yeasty at first, but then comes an apparent smooth amber sort of ale taste. Flavors of raspberry, apple, super quiet hops, and whiskey notes. Has a sweet fruit and moderate malt with a slight bitter and acidic twang at the end.  With a moderate length finish and a slightly oily mouthfeel, this beer gave no sense of the alcohol. I've had 330 ml bottles in a bar and I had a 750 bottle aged for about a year or so, and the former is much better than the latter. With age it mellowed without anything new emerging, and this beer is much better when it punchy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Stubbie1,4.25,This strong ale pours a deep dark blood orange. There was a head after the pour but it disappeared without a lace. This is a noisy brew. When I went for my first whiff if aroma all I heard was the head fizzing in my ears. There is a malt aroma thats accompanied with hints of citrus and yeast. The taste is smooth. It started with and is mostly malt with a smooth sweet finish. This is a very drinkable brew BUT watch out for the 8.0%!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Garin,4,"On the pour, I had to work to get a decent head on this one -- though once it was formed, it stayed reasonably well. It slowly shrunk into a creamy, cratery foam on top. The colour is a slightly cloudy golden amber, deepening to a rusty orange.  Malty, citrusy aromas are present. The flavour is spicy and clean, with a hint of bittery hops and more citrusy bitter. Biscuit flavours build. Yeast and sweet spice are also pleasant and delightful. It's refreshing and tasty.  The mouth feel is very nice and rich as well. It's full and lush, and somewhat warming. The light carbonation keeps it lively without annoying. Overall this is a very drinkable beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dwarbi,4.55,"Dark amber, reddish-copper, lovely looking thing of a brew. The head is about a centimeter. A thin layer remains for the length of the beer. Smells lightly of fruit. Tastes just a tad sweet, some spices. Fantastic. And even better mouthfeel! Creamy and rich. You can hardly taste any alcohol. Heavy in the belly, but highly drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Jarod,4.47,"Another great label from this brewery. Bottle Fermentation  This beer poured into the glass an amber/orange color that was cloudy but not overly cloudy as I could see plenty of carbonation bubbles trying to escape the glass. It produced a light beige colored head that was thick, rich, sticky and long lasting. Decent lace was produced from top to bottom. The aromas that came from the glass were of big fruits (oranges, pears and apples), deep malt, caramel, bread, pine nuts, alcohol (slight) and spices. The flavors that danced across my tongue were of fruits (oranges, light pears, and apples), roasted malts, sweet malts, hops ( pine and floral in nature) slight alcohol, bread, and spices. As far as aftertaste, I noticed that when first poured (cold) a dry hop taste was present, but as it warmed, it changed to a sweet malty  with a slight alcohol  taste. This is a creamy, sweet and chewy beer. Easy to drink and very flavorful. This beer seemed different then the others, seemed to be more simple in nature, not overly complex, but I enjoyed it just as much as the others I have had from this brewery. 2 thumbs up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,EmoBeerGuy,4.43,"This is one great beer. Had this one with my friends the other night...they've posted too. As the said, we had this one together when we knew nothing about beer and hated it. Ohhh have we come a long way. Unibroue is slowly becoming my favorite brewery in the world...though Ommegang is holding on slightly ( gotta support the locals).  This pours to a marvelous deep brown-orange which glows as light passes through. The taste is light and citrusy, with malt complexities too boot and a utlra smooth finish. It reminded me alot of Chimay Red which I had recently and I would like to taste them side to side. Great head with above average retention.  This beer lasted me about a half hour because I did NOT want to see it go. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BittRnessabounds,4.5,"I had Maudite for the first time about 8 months ago, and shamefully i have to admit i didn't like it at the time. My first tasting was at the very beginning of my discovery of craft beers, and since then I?ve sampled Maudite 3 other times, tonight being the 3rd time. Each time I?ve tasted this wonderful beer I?ve enjoyed it more. This wonderful ale pours a hazy deep orange/amber with a decent head and reasonably good retention. The smell is yeasty yet buttery with hints of fruit and spice. The taste is also wonderfully spicy and fruity with hints of yeast and just a touch of alcohol. Maudite exhibits a near perfect combination of flavors. The mild carbonation and medium body combined with the tremendous flavor and aroma make this an extremely enjoyable drink. You get no sense of the 8%ABV. This is a truly amazing beer and I?m glad I gave it a several more chances.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Marty,4.7,"Holy cow, this beer tastes like heaven. It's so complex that I think any attempt to apply qualitative descriptors would be in vain. Words cannot describe how delicous this beer is. Everything about Maudite is very well balanced, from the alcohol and hops to the spices and fruit. This is the best I've ever tasted in the style. Rock and roll, Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,francisweizen,4.87,"Maudite on tap is heavenly! I had these samples at the wonderful McLeans pub in Montreal, QC. This beer was presented to me with a nice, devel-ish dark red amber colour with a small head. The aromas were very spicy and yeasty. The taste was big, bold and wonderful. This beer tastes much different on tap than it does in bottles. It is very spicy, more yeasty and less boozy tasting. The mouthfeel is perfectly balanced and the drinkability is also exceptional. I had 3 glasses of this stuff before I knew it and I was well on my way to getting drunk...After-all, this stuff is 8% ABV! Cheers! -F",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,86MonteSS,4.55,"Well I'll be damned, a flying canoe!  First off, the bottle is right when it says ""uncommonly smooth."" I'd say it's easily Unibroue's smoothest. The ale and the head fought a little battle in my glass and the head just walked all over the ale, like a Panzer rolling over a Croissant stand. Orange-ish color, and come to think of it, almost orange-ish taste. Unlike a few of Unibroue's more celebrated beers, the yeast plays but a supporting role in Maudite. Sweet, alcoholic, tangy, fruity... I'm loving this one more and more as I reach the bottom of the 750.  Don't ask why, but in searching for the words to describe the carbonation, I could only think of that scene in Logan's Run where the 30-year olds float to the top of that arena and get zapped. I guess Unibroue's whole mythical/apocalyptic theme has me thinking of death. But Maudite just has me loving life!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,avylover,4.5,"Maudite - ""the damned""...well call me a sinner and send me to hell!! Pours in my guitar goblet a nice hazy orange-yellow with a huge foamy white head after a slightly aggressive pour. The scent is yeasty and fruity, as I have come to expect from unibroue This is one drinkable potent brew. It's spicy but spiced to match the taste, which is bready & fruity. I could drink this all night (with dire consequences) The carbonation only helps the drinkability. One of the best. Cheers Unibroue, eh?  - Added Note. 7/21/03 Came across a bad bottle of this last night. Absolutely no carbonation, and the cork was tight. Not the first time I got a suspect bottle. Pretty awful, but no change to review. Where's the QC?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,marburg,4.62,"The label's wrong! Rather than showing the damned, this beer should show a bunch of contented BAs passing into some sort of dreamy afterlife with ancestors, vestal virgins, football, and lots of quality beer -- or something similar.  Beautiful dark orangish color with an offwhite head. Very spritzy, seltzer-like mouthfeel to it. Taste is complex: fruits and peppery liveliness. You know the beer is kind of heavy, but it feels like a feather on your tongue. Damn good beer. It was flavorful and strong enough to compete with my Jamaican Jerk Chicken Sandwich at lunch today for sure. Tasty.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,dmarch,4.97,"This is definately among my top beers. It also has the coolest label I've ever seen. It pours a hazy amber color with a huge, well-retained head. Amazing spicy aroma and taste. I presume that they added some sort of spices to this. I'd like to find out which ones, because this sounds like it would be fun as a homebrew. Apparently maudite means damned. I never thought that being damned was a good thing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,inebrius,4.6,"The most poundable dubbel I know. Pours Autumn under Winter. Aromas conjure images of honey-drizzled sopapillas with slices of ripe pear. A draught is sugary, but light sugar, spun and quick and chased off by a dusting of spicy alcohol finished with a lop-sided hop grin. Tingly full and delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Scooter77,4.15,"How can anyone not enjoy the great damned one? I love all of the Unibroue brews that Ive had, so far, and this ones no exception. It pours a dark orange/brown color topped off with a huge fluffy, white froth that settles down leaving a bubbly 1/4-inch head. There is a nice burnt aroma that escapes from the glass with some sweet plum scents intermixed. The taste is extremely complex, there are so many flavors going on. The first taste was of charred wood, followed by the richness of malt and sweet caramel, finished off with an ever so slight spiciness of clove. This a good, solid medium-bodied beer. The only thing that lowers the drinkability rating a bit, is the high alcohol content, I cant have more than 2 or 3 in one setting.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,tavernjef,4.82,"This is one hell of yummy offering by the awesome Unibroue guys in Quebec. 750ml corked bottle, pop this sucker and immediately smell the mingling of sweet spices and warming alcohol. Oh yeah...it smells absolutly amazing, I just loved the sweet spicyness, lets see, theres some fruity sweets of orange peels, some nutmeg, ginger, clove, belgian-like yeast, and heck through in some roasted peppers. Then the taste is super rich and creamy smooth with lots of spicy action and tingly sweetness with a great roasty caramel malt backing thats very bold and smooth. The spice is peppery and fruity. Its got alot of things happening in the taste and feel, its just great to sip and ponder what the hecks all in this thing. The feel is medium heavy bodied, solid, silky smooth and a little bit creamy, that starts sweet, citrusy and malty then goes into the spice level and fades nicely into a fresh and drying bitter hop. Nothing here is overwhelming or overpowering, its all balanced in so softly its hard to phathom. This is one super awesome beer, highly recommend getting some.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,JohnnyDuvel,4.23,"Probably my favorite of the Belgian browns (reds? Dubbels?), compared with Chimay Red, Corsendonk brown, Oerbier, Val Dieu Brown, etc. I like pales best, and the darker (Chimay Blue, Trios Pistoles) next, as the browns seem to be a little sweeter to my taste. Maudite pours with a huge, foamy - somewhat carbonated head. Nice, malty taste and smell. Somewhat biscuity, but just a little on the sweet side. Quite a warmer, don't play around with this beer, as it will boot you in the ars!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,sinistersteve,2.96,"Well, I figured a beer with it's label donning a flying canoe and a serpent couldn't be all that bad. Turns out I was wrong. This one really didn't taste as well as I had hoped. The color was nice but the head seemed a bit fizzy. Much like other non-American beers, this one didn't do me any favors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,SamuraiJack,4.35,"I've yet to have a beer from Unibroue I didn't like. As a result, I was prepared to enjoy the Maudite. As it turned out, it would be more accurate to say that I THOUGHT I was prepared. I wasn't. It's truly an awesome beer. Lovely. Upon pulling the cage and popping the cork you're treated to a very light gas release from the bottle. Initial pour shows a dark russet/brown beer that is initially quite frothy and carbonated resulting in a quick and thick head that fades into a pretty sticky thin lace. While the beer has a slight haze it's not the usual yeasty cloud. Smells are of fruit esters, spicy yeast and a slight astringent warmth from the alcohol. The first taste of this beer is astonishing - really nearly overwhelming. So much flavour... malt and caramel and fruit followed by a rush of spice and a little citric-fruit bite and even a little pepper tickling the palette. There is some hop structure balancing the malt and fruit - but the beer is not by any means bitter. Tastes fade into a beautiful soft aftertaste of malt and fruit with the hops tightening the palette and making one wish for more - dying for the next sip, never cloying. I truly love this beer. It's good in the small bottles but oh so much better in the 750ml size. As insane as it might sound, I think I might order a case to cellar.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,shirfan,4.45,"This beer could probably make a killing (haha) at goth bars on packaging alone... happily, it also delivers on taste for the discerning beer geek.  Pours a cloudy brimstone-red with a fairly good head that boils down to a film of lace after a few minutes.  Smells strongly of nutmeg and clove cigarettes, backed up by complex yeasty belgian aromas.  Taste is a smooth mix of sweet raisins, more cloves, and discreet alcohol for the ABV. Notes of pears, nutmeg, and even pepper. Smooth, almost smoky notes mingle with yeast, fruity esters, good carbonation, and a nice zesty, sweet and spicy finish.  The Damned? Quebecois only earn that title when we're playing the Habs...but for producing beers like this, certainly not.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,WaltTrombone,4.32,"I found this at my local beer distributor (Beverage World, Peekskill, NY) in a 4 pack of 12 oz. bottles.  It poured orange-Brown, with an off-white head that disappeared straight away.  The aroma made me think of cream soda and ginger. The taste was complex, with a lemony tang predominant, and strong hints of nutmeg, ginger, apple, caramel, honey, and white pepper making their presnce known. Mouthfeel was creamy, maybe even a teeny bit oily, with a fizzy carbonation keeping things crisp. The finish was a mellow, dry, hoppy tang, fading to malty sweetness. The 8% ABV adds a nice warming effect.  Wow, what a beer! I can see why it's in the Top 50. I'm normally a stout fan, but this brew will help keep an open mind to other styles. Bravo, Unibroue!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,WVbeergeek,3.85,"Pours a very dark amber copper tone with an off white tan toned head, each sip is leaving a strong collar of lace down the glass. The aroma is full of an slightly alcoholic scent with fruit and malt sweetness surrounding the fragrance, quite magnificant very good dinner beer. The flavor is a bitter sweet dominance with hints of apple and other fruit thrown in, making this one quite a delight. This one has medium to light body very drinkable brew with a highly carbonated mouthfeel that makes this one tickle the back of the throat. A fine brew that I could drink with me dinner any time!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bierman2000,4.5,"Another fine product from Unibroue. Copper brown, dangerous and very drinkable the alcohol is detected in the finish only slightly. As it warms it takes on more nuances the hops come out a bite more and the complexity is one of a malty over bitter balance that is a perfect blend. Seek this one out and if you can get the mixed case of Unibroue, to savor the evry different flavors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,kbub6f,4.2,"Bought locally (Grapevine refrigerated shelves), a couple of weeks in my fridge, reviewed 45F-55F.  A big, coarse, cream-colored noisy head collapses quickly. The beer is copper with some sediment.  The smell is spicy, slightly malty. The inhale is a little dusty. The front is spicy and buttery! The middle is apple fruity and the finish is bitter with a nice sourness with some alcohol. The aftertaste is butter and apples. This is a very tasty beer. I'm revisiting all the Unibroue after a few years living away from Québec. This isn't my favorite Unibroue, but it's close.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,GreenCard,3.69,"Pours a ruddy brown, semi-cloudy, and VERY bubbly. Tan, loose-bubbled head. Low head retention due to alcohol content.  Aroma of dried apricots and prunes, some banana ester, malty underbelly, and a slight alcohol twinge. Little to no hop aroma.  Tastes initially of a semi-sweet baked pear (well-done), then the alcohol kicks in all warm and the ester bouqet lights up your entire palette, especially the olfactory bulb. The taste of this beer is very much seated in your sense of smell. A mild hop bitterness fades in mid-way through. Finishes semi-dry with a slight bitterness lingering in the aftertaste.  Medium-bodied despite the abv (typical with these Belgian ales). The carbonation is very aggressive and plays a substantial role in the flavor-break, in lieu of hop flavor/bitterness. LOTS of alcohol warmth.  Another great one from Unibroue. They put out some great brews, all of which I hold in high regard.  UPDATE:  [The following is a review of a bottle that has aged about 5 years, a little more. The best-by date is 07-31-05]  Appearance: pale orange, slight haze, thin layer of suds that quickly dissipate to almost nothing  Aroma: sherry, rum, hint of sourness, subdued spice, multivitamin  Flavor: mellow malt profile with a brown-sugary edge; hints of cork, mold, honey, pepper and raisins in the background; little to no bitterness; finishes semisweet with a clovery aftertaste  Mouthfeel: medium-full body, spritzy carbonation, alcohol warmth  Other comments: A fresh bottle of Maudite is a wonderful beer. But one aged way past its best-by date... not so much. Flaccid and uninteresting.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,brakspear,3.78,"Pours a very hazy copper/orange with explosive carbonation that gushed out of the bottle upon opening. Nice creamy head forms but reduces quickly even with the excessive carbonation.  The aroma is mild but filled with cloves and slight banana notes.  The taste is complex, sweet caramels blend with cloves and bready flavors. Finishing with a slight acidic tang.  Overall a very nice beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,PhantomVodoo,4.2,Cloudy amber color that makes me think of caramel. Huge tan head that leaves lace. Aroma sings of yeast. Banana and clove are noted. Sweet caramel malt scent as well.  Taste is complex. Sweetness that is caramel and toffee in nature. Yeast plays big with notes of banana. Hops provide a nice balance. Beer is just slightly sweet overall. Enjoyable flavor.  Bottle fermented so lots of carbonation in the mouthfeel. Good drinkability. The yeast plays a huge role in this beer. Quite good overall.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Winter,4.03,"12 oz bottle. Maudite poured a cloudy amber with an off-white creamy head. Malt, fruit and yeast combine for a rather pleasing sweet aroma. Mouthfeel is smooth, yet crisp, with a creamy from the carbonation. Malty middle. The 8% abv is first noticed as it warms the back of the tongue. Finish retains the alcohol and fruity flavor to it. Another fine offering from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BeerBuilder,3.92,"This brew pours to a copper color with an off-white head; leaves a bit of lacing while sipped down. The aroma is sweet, medicinal with a clove-like aroma. The flavors that stand out are a sweet maltiness with a herbal/medicinal impact. Like within the aroma, again I detect bits of clove in the flavor. It is a medium-bodied and smooth brew that finishes semi-sweet; it is sure to sneak up on you with its strength. Another great Unibroue offering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,feloniousmonk,4.72,"The color is the loveliest, most perfect red you can imagine, the color of Satan's pajamas, and the head is bubbly, prickly, fantastically white.  Aroma is largely spicy, utterly delightful, with additional notes of dark fruits, berries, currant, citrus, and a hint of flowers, plus a good helping of lemon.  Good carbonation, and a massive deployment of hops upon the palate. The alcoholic component does not seem obvious at all, nay, it sneaks up upon you, as you innocently enjoy this delicious ale. Very smoth and tasty as anything on earth, heaven, or hell. Medium body, sufficient malt, but the hops are fully in charge here, and deliver the drinker into fully refreshing enjoyment.  One of the best beers in the whole damned world!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,purplehops,4.32,"Maudite pours a slightly hazy burnt orange with plenty of off-white head that laces nicely down the sides of the glass. The aroma is passion fruit, oranges, cake mix, and grains of paradise with hints of alcohol. The taste starts with creamy malt flavors and slight carbonation tickle on the tongue. It then moves to a rush of fruit flavors like orange and lemon blending with caramel malt flavors. The finish is yeasty and spicy with coriander and orange peel flavors making an appearance. Aftertaste is a balance of everything above coming together to give you a warm happy glow. The mouthfeel is full and rich with some smoothness and plenty of effervescence to tickle your tongue. Overall a great ale. Another ale from Unibroue that proves the worlds best doesn't have to come from Belgium.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Admiraldinty,4.07,"Amber with lots of yeasty particulate matter. Pours a foamy head that quickly dissipates into a ring. Very spicy-alcohol smelling, lots of fruit. Tastes just like it smells, yeasty, spicy, and loads of fruit. Wasn't quite as flavorful as I expected, however. Mouthfeel is very crisp. This is a beer I can only have once in a while, as it completely screws up my tastebuds for the rest of the night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MJR,4.35,"Appearance: Pours an amber/copper color with reddish highlights. The light tan head starts absolutely huge, then shrinks down to a respectable cap. Reasonably good lacing down the side of the glass. The body's cloudy from being bottle-conditioned.  Smell: Has a complex and warming nose of bready malt, yeast, and candied fruit. Suggestions of clove and orange peel are obvious. A good bit of spiciness is also in the mix.  Taste: This one's quite complex and flavorful with lots of clove, dark fruit, and an organic, bready and malty flavor. The spiciness is consistent from the first sip to the aftertaste, which complements the juicy fruit flavors and candy sugar sweetness. The strong alcohol barely even makes itself known. There's the slightest touch of sourness on the tail end...  Mouthfeel: On the thinner side of medium-bodied with a dry, crisp finish. Finishes quite clean on the palate. Ideally, I'd like this just a bit thicker, as it's a bit watery.  Drinkability: Great, considering it's strength. I couldn't drink these all night, as I wouldn't want to face the next morning, but a few would be more than welcome.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Realale,4.49,"Tasted from a 750ml corked bottle with a best before date of 3/5/05  Hazy gold, with a significant red/orange blush to it. Huge tight head settles very slowly to a thin cap of fine bubbles. Each additional pour results in a resurgence of the massive head.  Nose is incredibly complex. A ton of sweet malt with a significant clove/phenol underpinning. As it warms a touch, a parade of rich dark dried fruits appear - prune, red grape/raisin, date. Then some citrus notes are there - orange zest or candied orange peel. Wow.  Very complex and bready in the mouth, but a step down from that amazing nose. The fruitiness is not as intense, and the clove is more pronounced. The rich malt is really the star player here. The length is very good, and there is slight sourness which adds to both the complexity and length - but its only apparent on the finish.  Great mouthfeel from the fine bottle-conditioned carbonation, but as the 750ml draws to a close, its becoming a bit ponderous, and I could really use a bit more prickle to get me across the finish line. Perhaps I'll just have to share the next bottle of Maudite . . . Naaaaah. Very drinkable for what it is.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Mitchster,4.8,"Unibroue review preface: I spent 2 weeks up in Montreal and drank Unibroue beers the whole time. No wonder they call it UniBrew. Their beers all taste similar. They are all very subtle variations on a theme, that theme being excellence in brewing. That said:  ""Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale"". Belge?...peut-être. Noir?....um, Je ne panse pas. Fort?....oui. Lightly cloudy medium-amber with a touch of sedimentation and potent carbonation forms a voluminous light meringue white head. Hangs around for the entire beer. Excellent retention and nice lacing. Aroma is, at a distance, green apples, but with yer nose in the glass, it's phenolic bavarian wheat, with cloves and bananas of course. There are very subtle notes of brown sugar, but with Unibroue, it's all about the yeast and exceptionally clean ferment. I have to say, I just drank a La Fin Du Monde and it smells exactly like it...it's just darker in appearance. Taste is typical bavarian dunkel weizen mit heife, but with a more substantial malt character/alcohol content and the typical explosive, spritzy mouthfeel. Has a touch of amber malt peeking through and a smidge of bourbon character. No sourness or basement character noted. Finish, besides the slightly smoky sugars, has a very pleasant clean alcohol blast and warms the gullet. (Tirade: I wish more brewers could get this right. Too often, the alcohol kick is fusel and isopropyl, and just dang nasty. Clean is the word, folks and everyone should take lessons from the brewers at Unibroue!). After the Samuel Smith Imperial Stout, I'm feeling a pleasant buzz. Think Edelweiss DunkelDoppleWeizen.  Another world-class brew in the Unibroue lineup. This is also a benchmark for beers in the style. Dangerously drinkable at 8% ABV, this one is an absolute beauty. I love it! Highly recommended!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Dantes,4.2,"Package: 750ml corked bottle, labeled 8% ABV, Best Before 04-22-05. Another beautiful label with real appeal.  Cost: $5.99  Presentation: tulip glass at 50º, tasted the night after a bottle of La Fin du Monde.  Appearance: Nice mahogany brown, with burgundy highlights. Streamers of fine bubbles cutting through a cloudy body. Head is extremely dense, although lighter and less subtantial than La Fin du Monde. Settles to a self-replenishing ½ to ¾ of an inch.  Smell: Banana, clove, apple, pear, and raisins. Also a faint hint of rum!  Taste: A panoply of complex fruitiness: raisins, banana, and a bit of crisp, green apple. A richer, softer flavor profile than the crisper LFdM. The middle and finish weren&#8217;t quite as substantial as I had hoped, which I have experienced lately in some of the Unibroue beers. These were younger examples, tasted off-the-shelf for comparison purposes.  Mouthfeel: A softer, less assertive mouthfeel than the LFdM. Not as substantive as some other strong dark ales.  Drinkability: A very nice beer that is not as challenging as some of the other Unibroue offerings. Smooth and likable.  Another good offering from Unibroue. My one quibble is that I think they split hairs in offering so many expressions on a similar theme. An excellent beer to pour with cheeses (fondue!), smoked fish, olives, and especially a plate of poutine!  Backwash: I think that I prefer the Trois Pistoles from Unibroue, as well as the Chimay Grande Reserve, Westvleteren 12 (perhaps an unfair comparison), and the Abbaye des Rocs. Definitely a very good beer, but not the best of its type. Je me serai condamner!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,TheLongBeachBum,4.22,"A Brown 750ml bottle, which has a lovely deep red, orange and black oval label on the obverse depicting what appears to be a levitated rowing boat full of people. The horned and winged demon at the bottom hints that you should not mess with this beer. Nice presentation and a warm looking label.  The cage was removed from this 750ml monster and as the cork, marked (dated?) 2-2 was forcibly extracted, it kindly reminded me with a thupp and a lovely ghostly wisp of light white-grey gun smoke that disappeared almost instantly.  The head raced up the glass releasing huge aromas as it formed into a cream colored mass of bubbles. Wow. I have a feeling I am going to enjoy this beer. Eventually the head settles to a 1 depth that is comprised of above average sized bubbles that continue to burst as their surface tension lose the battle against natures other forces, namely my mouth. The beer is an ever-so-slightly hazed copper color with hints of orange-amber. This has a fantastic look to it when in a handled 20 fl.oz. Glass.  Aromas are awesome, I worked in a Bakery when I was Student and this beer took me right back to my spotty youth. Smells were released very early on; they positively raced and leapt out the glass in a scene reminiscent of the opening of the Ark of the Covenant in the Indiana Jones Film. Unlike the German Afrika Korp Soldiers, my face did not melt though, by my eyes did light up however. Fantastic, much better than Vicks Vapo-Rub for opening your nasal passages.  Tastes are also of fresh bread again, malt, caramel and a feint alcohol lick. A complex fruity but ever changing beer that is rediscovered during every mouthful. A very solid beer and a seasoned performer for sure. Extremely well balanced. This is one seriously drinkable 8% ABV Beer. This beer definitely should be labeled  Highly Dangerous - One Bottle is NEVER enough. Even after 22 ozs I want more.  I hear they speak French in Quebec. Well this is a bloody good ale that could easily fool a crazy uni-lingual Englishmen into believing that I can do the same after just one bottle.  Merde, Cest Bon !!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,AudioGilz,3.31,"This beer poured super frothy, the head was about 3 fingers...maybe I poured it too roughly. Appearance is a very cloudy brown, slightly dark brown. The smell gave me fruity, citrusy ideas in my head. The taste is very strongly fruit, and some tartiness. I almost had to shiver from the flavor until I got used to it. The taste, so complex, I swirl it around for a while and find myself doing that longer and longer, savoring it. But then it goes down and I'm left with a not so enjoyable aftertaste. Kinda of a bitter, alcohol, spoiled fruit taste. Maudite and beers like this one might just be an acquired taste. This is my first try at Belgian Dark Strong Ales, so who knows, they might grow on me. I bought a set of 3 Unibroue products in a small wooden crate: Maudite, La Fin Du Monde, and Trois Pistoles. So I have two supposedly great beers ahead of me to try out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,proc,4,"Pours out to a cloudy, amber in the glass. Aroma is that of bread, yeast and light fruit. Taste is slightly spicy, yet with a subtle sweetness. The swallow finishes with a spicy tang. There is a nice alcohol warming effect tht isn't overwhelming. It got better as it warmed up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,UncleJimbo,4.23,"Presentation: 12 oz amber bottle with screw cap. Best Before 09-23-02 (about 4 months past date). Poured into a goblet.  Appearance: Cloudy, light brown with light tan foam.  Smell: Citrus, musty grapes, apples, oak, with faint malt and yeast, and a hint of alcohol.  Taste: Champagne-like, lightly fruity (grapes), lightly malty. Very pleasant.  Mouthfeel: Fizzy, slightly tart, mellow, with a warming feeling.  Drinkability: Very good. Smooth. Easy to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Tubesox,5,"La Maudite was WONDERFUL.  This hazy orangish brown beer has an exceptional sweet taste, but not too sweet. Not at all bitter.  This is by far my Favorite beer. I had a beer in a Chicago Brewery that tasted just like it. I Loved it, I have been looking for something similar ever since. This is it. I'd recommend this beer to anyone. It's a little pricey, but worth it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,kelticblood,4.01,"Exceptional pour.Poured a giant soapy white foam head that slowly dissolved.The color is cloudy brown or even dark orange.Lots of sediment and stuff swirling around inside.The aroma was of hops and fruit with a acidic citrus touch.The 8% alcohol was noticed at the first sip and made my eyes water a bit.A medium body with a smooth mouthfeel.Seems to lack in carbonation a bit,,could be a bit more crisp.Very smooth and creamy finish thats refreshing and not bitter at all.Tastes delivers a bready biscuit lemon touch with a fruit wheat finish.Overall a very good experience and I will certainly buy it again.  Note: No lace retention at all..",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Jason,4.25,"12 oz brown bottle with a best before date on the back label.  Appearance: Hazed orange amber, tiny yeast particles are noticed in the brew. The lace is light in retention though the carbonation holds some there while active.  Smell: Bready, almost cake like malt aroma. Dollop of spice and ripe fruit with a well seen alcohol of esters and light solvent.  Taste: Faint caramel malt, ripe pine apple fruitiness, and bold spices that is dominant of clove. Heavy side of phenols with a spicy sweet alcohol, touch herbal from the phenols also. Straight up hop bitterness is light compared to the other flavours but still seems to flavour and balance.  Mouthfeel: Nearly excessively crisp, solid medium body with some slickness.  Drinkability & Notes: Packed with flavour, this one does not hold back at all. Very expressive and the sheer complexity does it for me. I keep this one around to keep my taste buds in check.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,IrishRedRock,4.13,"Not overpowering in any way...not what I expected at all. It was so smooth and delicious, even my female non-real beer drinking friends thought it was quite good. That says a lot right there.  It poured amber with a bit of a reddish hue, with a thick white head that stays around for a while. Perfect balance of caramel malt with a nice hoppy finish to balance things out. Smooth, sensual, and delicious. This one will not let you down.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,kunzbrew,4.35,This brew pours a cloudy copper color with a monster head that leaves a sexy lace in it's tracks. The caramel maltiness is very pleasant and the hops are not over bearing. The medium body is perfect for this strong dark ale. Earthy notes are are present after the brew warms a little. This is an outstanding brew and I see why it is number #13 on the list.  Cheers,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,johnrobe,4.07,"Best before 3/12/05 Maudite, or ""damned"", features one of the best labels for a Halloween party. Let me tell ya, if this beer is wrong, I don't wanna be right. It pours a devilishly murky brown with a white head that maintains a cap throughout. The aroma has that champagne-like quality that I associate with the effects of Belgian ale yeast. There are also hints of green apples and a bit of caramel and some spice I can't quite place. The taste is nicely balanced between a complex fruitiness and caramel, with noticeable (but not overwhelming) alcohol showing up toward what turns out to be a bit of a tangy finish.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,cretemixer,4.18,"Beautiful pour. Cloudy deep amber color with a firm, almost elastic, head. Nice malty aroma that begs to be tasted. Almost has a burnt quality to it. There's a taste I can't quite put my finger on, I may just have to drink another. Overall quite tasty with a nice alcohol warmth.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Wildman,4.5,"This beer poured a copper amber color and formed a white bubbly head that left trace lace. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and spices. A flavor of malt, caramel, citrus and some spice. The finish is a touch sweet, yet astrigent. A nice Belgian.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Mick,4.7,"Golden amber color. Thick creamy head that leaves a sticky lace trail. Malty aroma, slightly phenolic. Thick, creamy, and smooth body. Malty sweet taste and good alcohol presence that balances and couples the body and flavor experience nicely. Finishes really smooth.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ElGuapo,4.37,"pours to a somewhat golden brown amber with an enormous head that will leave lace till the end of the day.  the aroma is very welcoming with nice yeast odors and some very good malts cooming about. there is also a definite hint of alcohol.  the body is very rich and smooth. it is very good to drink as is slides right down. a great flavored beer with everything in balance. a very good malty sweetness dominates with a good addition of bitterness, and it was pleasant to find just a small tinge of alcohol.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Morris729,4.95,"Pours a hazy light mahogany color with a frothy off-white head. Nice head retention and eventually dissipates into a nice lace. Fruity and spicy aromas up front with a bit alcohol. Taste is very complex. There is a bit of a fruity sweetness up front with tastes of banana, honey, and caramel. Next comes a citrus/lemon tart sting in the mouth along with a bit of nuttiness and biscuity flavor. The finish is a dry and bread-like with some hoppy phenols. Considering its 8%, you really cant detect much alcohol. This is an outstanding beer. As for the demon and the flying canoe on the bottle, heres the story from the Unibroue website  Maudite has a typically Quebecois name that is reminiscent of the legend of the Chasse-Galerie (the legend of the Flying Canoe). Legend has it that a group of lumberjacks struck a deal with the devil to fly home in their canoes, guided by Satan himself, to make it home in time for Christmas.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,doerickson,4.13,"Pours a cloudy iced tea-like color with a frothy off-white head that hangs around. Spicy, citrusy, fruity aroma. Moderate carbonation. Sweet flavors of candy apple and banana, with some residual sugar in the finish, which was quite short. Good stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,AtrumAnimus,4.27,This canadian brew is truelly a Belgian Style ale. Fantastic in my opinion. A stabple in my fridge now along with Schneider Aventinus. The real surprise is that this ia a Canadian beer.  Creamy in texture with a great aroma. Fruity and spicy. Clean finish that leaves you wanting more.  I find the 750ml bottles allloow for better final fermentation leading to a richer taste and better head when you pour that the 12 oz bottle.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Kwak,5,Maudite Head : Thick Firm Full of spices. Body : Smooth clear amber color. Taste : Fruity Malt flavor with spices and nut flavor . Aftertaste: Almost winey warming affect in the end.  Very strong but verry easy to drink.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,OatmattStout,4.08,"Poor: this beer poored well and gave a nice 2"" tan frothy head that was poured into an appropriate tulip. Large bubbles cascaded slowly up the sides of the glass for the first half of this beer.  Appearance: Was like a good apple cider in color and in clarity. Good leftovers from the second bottle fermantation in this beer, that I made sure to swirl just a bit into the poor.  Smell: Of fruits, alchohol, and some yeast qualities.  Taste: not a frequent drinker of this red strong ale style but all in all what I had expected. More of a malty sweetness with a slight and well balanced hop charateristic that hung aroung just long enough. Flavors of dried fruits also.  Mouthfeel: Had qualities of a champagne on the tounge and a fairly light finish. [coming from a stout drinker]  Drinkability: As I finish this review and coincidentaly this beer my head already knows this isn't a regular beer.It has good drinkability in moderation and it's 8% alchohol hit's you fast, and if your looking for a punch this ones got it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Delirium,4.5,"The turbulant volcanic head, smells of smoldering newspapers with a hint of old rubber that is being pulled tightly and light musk. Unlike many beers the smell is a fair illustration of what is to come in taste, a smooth incredibly well balanced imbibable reflection of body, spirit and mind.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BeerManDan,4,"Not one of my favorites from Unibroue, but still a good beer. I find the aroma and taste very pleasant but have a hard time putting this aroma and flavor to words. Although complex, I'm lost for words. I will try it again and see if I can taste the complexity of flavors in this beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jtw5877,4.8,"Pours a gold/amber color with a fluffy white head. The yeast is very prominent in the taste and smell. It has a massive complex flavor that is all over the place, it changes as it warms, but it never hints at its high abv. This beer has become one of my absolute favorites especially out of the 750ml corked bottles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MaineBeerMan,4.75,"Very nice looking beer with a cloudy golden amber color and a big foamy head that thins quickly and leaves a lot of lace on the glass. The aroma is very fruity like pears and oranges with spicey notes quite evident and a subtle grassy scent in there too. Flavor is awesome very hard to pin down, you notice new subtleties with every sip especially as the beer warms a bit. Hits with a big sweetness that says fruit more than malt, with a nice zesty carbonation. As it sits on the tongue spices and a white grapefuit bittersweet sourness can be noted. Just a dash of yeast flavor and not much hop type bitterness at all in this one, but the flavors all blend and balance really well. This beer is very drinkable, though the higher ABV might keep you from drinking a bunch of them.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,DerKaiser,4.32,"I'll have to say, I only noticed about 1/3 of the characteristics that the previous reviewer noted, but I'm sure that's likely a consequence of my underexperienced palate.  At any rate, Maudite is just damn good beer (no pun intended). I notice clove and banana flavors, with just a hint of bubble gum, as well. Carmel and toasted notes help distinguish Maudite from some of the other Unibroue products, although they all have similar, wonderful characteristics.  I had a Chimay Blue last night with dinner and for me Maudite is simply better.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,marc77,4.52,"Dark bronze in hue, topped by an ivory white, bumpy, well retained head that leaves spotty lace. Sweetness in aroma is a combination of notes of honey, medium caramel malt and ripe, sugary citrusy fruitiness. Buttery biscuit malt and mellow banana ester add additional complexity, while mild notes of powered cocoa surface as the beer breathes. A snap of unripe citric lemony tartness yields to a deeply caramelized, yet restrained dark candi sugar sweetness. Yeast contributions in flavor are comprised of pleasant clove phenol and understated banana esters. Mild hop bitterness, along w/ dry biscuit malt surface mid palate and provide a delayed offsetting of the caramelized sweetness. When the yeast is poured, this brew gains a nuttiness and mellow mustiness that adds to the overall depth in flavor. Light to medium bodied, but once the initial high C02 level dissapates, a dextrinous mouthfeel conducive to superlative drinkability is revealed. Finishes lightly sweet, bready w/ a hint of dry chalkiness. Maudite is a truly unique and delicious brew. It possesses the citric qualities of a tripel, the estery, chocolately traits of a dubbel and the rich deeply fruity notes of a dark strong. A refined, yet robust stylistic hybrid. I could drink this all day if my liver would allow it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bewareOFpenguin,4.33,"Sampled this by accident. Picked up a four pack of Trois Pistoles and one ""snuck"" in. Poured with a hazy, clouded look. Not much of a head, just a light lacey foam. Tasted spicey and fruity, but not over powering. Not even the slightest hint of the ABV. I am now going to get a four pack of these.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,putnam,4.33,"Sampled blind with bottles of Ommegang, Duinen Dubbel, La Fin du Monde and Orval. Hazy liquid the color of aged Bourbon supports an even, durable head. The smell is of canned fruit, specifically mandarine oranges as well as fresh, ripe strawberries. Simply sweet. Agreeable. Velvety rich palate contains an impression of bright sweetness offset briefly by notes of caramel and whispers of coffee and sweet spices. Extremely smooth, like mink or sable. Nice. This is for the American palate with all of its easy sweetness and smooth texture.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,hyuga,4.65,"Slightly cloudy with a mahogany wood color. Great Belgian head from the bottle fermentation, and it knows how to stay. Some lace is left that slowly slides down the slope of the glass. Huge and complex spicy aroma! Coriander, pepper, and cinnamon, as well as dried fruit, banana, and maybe some plum. Impressive! On to the palate... so very many flavors appear! Spicy and fruity overall, but this, of course, requires an in-depth commentary. Black pepper tickles at the tongue first, then coriander and sweet plum come into play. Tart and dried fruit character are also found among the many flavors that run rampant on your palate. Many of the subtleties are hard to catch! Alcohol is only detectable in the warming effect. Yeast is only slightly detectable, but its presence increases as more of the 750 ml. bottle's contents are emptied into the glass. Grainy malt finish with a bit of spice. A distinct black pepper tingle is left on the tip of your tongue. Massively complex, yet medium-bodied. Almost a full-course dinner in a bottle. This is a ""damned"" (get it?) wonderful ale! Masterpiece!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,aaronh,4.88,"This is my second Unibroue experience, and I must say it is even better than the first. This beer has a captivating bright red color with copper highlights and an off-white head. The head dissipates quickly, but lingers the entire glass and leaves a nice lace. The aroma is sweet and rather like a fine merlot. The taste is exquisite, without a trace of alcohol. Maltiness is evident, and a fruity sweetness is present in the finish. I can mainly taste ripe plum, but I am reminded of a good sweet red wine. The best (or perhaps worst) characteristic is it is a pleasure to drink. Again, this is an elite beer from Unibroue. I am truly beginning to understand why Belgian style beers become so alluring to so many.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,MAB,4.73,"You have to try this beer! I've been enjoying it for more than eight years, and I have to rate it as one of my all time favorites. At a past beer tasting, the brewery rep told me that Maudite ages well- five years or so- in the bottle. Intrigued, I bought a bottle (the large corked version, not the individual metal capped kind in a six-pack) and labelled it with the year, then tried to ignore it for 3 years. I had a friend over and we didn't think there would be any difference, but boy were we wrong! The aged Maudite is much less spicy and yeasty; it's flavours are more combined and it is very smooth with an incredible mouthfeel. It is almost worth having a separate rating for aged/ nonaged product. Wow!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mzwolinski,4.41,"Yeah, the bottle's great isn't it? The beer itself is quite attractive, too. A slightly hazy, darkish amber with a thin lacy head.  Immediately upon pouring, the aroma is dominated by yeast and fruit -- perhaps banana? Yeasty smell moderates quickly and is replaced by a mellow malty aroma.  Fruit sweetness, a mellow malty base, and a peppery finish. Very little hop flavor, and very little alcohol flavor for such a strong beer. Retro-olfaction really adds to the enjoyment.  A much lighter strong ale than Unibroue's Trois Pistoles, this is a medium bodied beer. The high carbonation lends to its being quite drinkable. I drank this from a 750 ml bottle, and planned to save half for tomorrow. Alas!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,jackndan,4.7,"Maudite: on tap, in a small snifter. Extremely complex beer. It pours a deep ruby black, with little head. The initial aroma is yeast and bananas, with hints of Christmas spices. My notes indicate black licorice, coriander, cider, spices, and port, with a crisp bite of hops. Fantastic!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Murph,4.38,"Pours a dark, slightly hazy, ruby/amber color with a thick, creamy tan head that rings the glass nicely. Sweet candy sugar and fruity aromas rule the nose which is slightly muted compared to the rest of the beer (although this may be due to my headcold.) Huge sweet candy flavors make this brew very smooth across the tongue. There are also some very big dark fruit presence as well. The alcohol level is only perceived as a warming quality. The smoothness of this brew is nicely offset but the intense carbonation that is so typical for the belgian strong ales. The lack of any real alcohol presence and great smooth qualities make this brew excellently drinkable. Yet another excellent brew from our neighbors to the north. Unibroue makes some damn fine brews and that is all there is to it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Bighuge,4.22,"Pours with a champagne like fizziness. A bubbly head dissipates rather quickly. The beer is a murky brown/orange hue. Spicy and yeasty nose. (Pepper, corriander, ginger, bready and doughy.) Nicely carbonated mouthfeel. Drinkability is high for an 8% a/v. Taste is similar to the aroma. Yeasty doughiness. Spicy zip (pepper and orange curacao). And some bitterness attributed to the hop load, though not high. High quality again from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Suds,3.91,"Hazy amber-orange color with a big, impressive head. Yeasty, spicy nose, but not as pronounced as I expected. Very carbonated. Alcohol warming is present, but subtle for the 8%. Spicy and yeasty, smooth and rich belgain style beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,the42ndtourist,3.49,"341 mL bottle. I dunno. Maudite let me down, I was expecting something wonderful, but it was just kind of average. The appearance, however, is really cool - the dark cloudy auburn colour and the massive head. The taste is a little spicy, but the alcohol shone through a little too much for my taste. Drinkable, but I woudn't go for more than one in a night. maybe a magnum of this will taste a bit better....",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,zerk,3.85,"Deep amber / copper with a thin lace. Very yeasty nose and flavor, with fruity esters and a pretty fair amount of spice. Others referred to black pepper, and I would probably agree.

22,33,Reverand,4.5,"Amazing beer, pours almost like a champagne. A brilliant amber colored beer with bubbly head. A beer that is not for the faint hearted at 8% definitely not a session beer but more of a sipping beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,LarryV,4.5,"Pours a dark, opaque amber color. Aroma is slightly malty with the overtones of yeast, but the yeastiness isn't overdone in this particular brew. Complex flavor, some fruitiness that turns to a pepper flavor on the back of the tongue. Easy to drink and definitely leaves you wanting another. One of my favorite beers from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,BeerAngel,4.23,"Pours a dark caramel color with a cream colored 3 finger head. The smell is that of yeast which is typical of the Unibroue's beers and also the common hint of fruit. The taste is very well balanced with a variety of tones that change from the beginning to the end of each swallow. Although it has similar fruity flavors as some of Unibroue's others, this one is done even better than most of the others as far as the blend of flavors. A medium to heavy bodied beer with a slight stickiness at the end. This is one great brew! My last ""A votre sante!"" for a while as I have finished the last Unibroue product that I have.  It's been a great adventure in Unibroue land, but all good things must come to an end. But now I know which one's to grab when they are staring at me from the shelf.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,frank4sail,4.15,"Best before 9-10-04 Strong bold yeast alcohol nose. Pink champagne looking with wisps of white lace on the surface of the brew. Slightly fruity tasting with a big yeast tongue. Slightly sweet malt base with layers of soft flavor. Very soft on the mouth. This should be the introductory unibroue product for newbies, because it is soft and easy drinking in every way. It is not as bold as their other products, but it does stand on its own as a smooth, uncommon, wonderful treat.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,tigerpaws,3.68,"Actually have to say I tried this beer because of the label (one of the best I've seen) who says marketing doesn't sell. But was pleased after I did, very strong alcohol aroma, nice dark appearance and it kicks. I would recommend this beer to belgian lovers ouot there I think you would enjoy...........CHEERS",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ADR,4.31,"A darker color, color is like the paint ""Burnt Umber""...upcharging bubbles contribute to a head thats big at first but then mostly sticks to the side of the wine goblet's edges. Muted somewhat fruity aroma cut with some allspice. Mouth-coating impact, spicy like a pumpkin pie in flavor. Carbonation persists to finish, muting a slightly alcoholic presence and adding a nice touch to the mixed citrus/apple alternative taste. One of my favorites in this style, not excessively wine-like but with good complexity. The color of this brew is unique and the flavor is complex but balanced. A beer of distinction, worth sharing the uncorking with some buddies on special occassions. A perfect ""first"" beer before switching to some Porters and Stouts.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mophie,4.05,"Looks like apple cider -- cloudy, copper color, with a nice, full head. Mildly fruity aroma of apple and spice. Taste is not as full as I expected at first, probably because I needed to let it warm up a bit. Once warmed, there was a perfect balance of sweet malt and fruity tang, with a rather powerful spicy finish (pepper, coriander, and clove). Nicely carbonated as well. I liked this beer during the first glass, but truly appreciated it during the second. Unibroue is awesome.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mickeymac,4.5,"This is a truly exceptional beer. It has a nice malt flavor, but the spicy and sweet undertones really set it apart. From the first sip, I was hooked on this one. Fortunately my corner store always has it in stock. However, after drinking this on a fairly regular basis since my original review, I'm lowering my review on taste and mouthfeel jsut a bit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,WilliamPhilaPa,4.3,"Maudite pours a nice, cloudy, dark copper color. The big creamy head, which I almost misseddwindles to nill. A faint fuity aroma on the nose, and on the palate a little zestiness as well. Medium body w/ light carbonation. The finish is that of zestiness and a bit of warming action going on. Overall a good la bière!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,rastaman,3.85,"i like it a lot, very smooth, not to cloying and sweet and good malt profile, a very very decent beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,aracauna,4.14,"The color is nice. Medium dark reddish brown and cloudy. The head is a bit foamy and dissapates quickly. It has a mild pleasant smell. The flavor lacks some of the complexity that I would expect from a Belgian style brew, but the more I drank, the more I liked it. The alcohol only leaves the slightest footprint on the tongue -- just enough to let you know it's there. Overall, a good beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Bierman9,4.35,"Maudite comes through a cloudy, medium-brown, hazy color. Loads of yeasties in the bottle (keeps you regular!). A big creamy head soon recedes to a small ring of lace. A nice fruity, yeasty nose...mmmm..""come to Papa!"". Medium body, and a touch of carbonation on the tongue... It's fruity to start (in a tropical fruit type of manner), with a spicy, dry finish. Similar to Trois Pistoles, but more pronounced. Unibroue does some nice work!  overall: 4.4 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  82",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,cokes,4.65,"Well I'll be damned (literally, as Maudite means damned). Sorry at this weak stab at humor. I'll blame the evil powers of this tempting and devious beverage. What can one say about this brew to do it justice? Outstanding with a sweet,solid malt background that has some fruitness. Typical Unibroue spiciness ensues. Dark amber in color. Head stays for a little while before departing for parts more holy. I think there are some dark forces at work in this beer. All I hear right now is the voice in my head: DRINK ANOTHER, you love the beer so, DRINK ANOTHER. Well, time to heed to my delerium, and I suggest you do the same. Grab some and enjoy. Truely a brewing masterpiece. Let me know which circle of hell serves Maudite...so I can aim appropriately.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,bk3nj,3.86,"I'm not really sure what the fuss is about, exactly. Don't get me wrong, it's good, just not spectacular. I got a lot of the spiciness, and it was very pretty looking, but I didn't taste any fruit, and the spice was overwhelming. Although I might have just had a bad bottle...I'll try again sometime.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Brent,4.6,"Drink and be happy. Nice balance, with reserved fruityness, followed with some spicy bite. The yeast flavor is well integrated.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,mmthompson33,4.76,This beer is a step above your ordinary fine beer. It has a mystique and complexity that is not often matched.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,ThreePistols,4.3,"Dark amber to copper. Initial taste is intense fruity maltiness, followed by a slightly tart/spicy and fruity aftertaste. There's an alcohol taste, but it's well-balanced in the mix.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,pbrian,5,"Exceptional, like all Unibroue beers. It has a complex drinkability that defies its strength.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,John,5,Superb! Hail Unibroue!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,douglisbeck,5,A fine Belgian-style beer at less the cash.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
22,33,Todd,4.85,"Presentation: ""Maudite"", translates to ""Cursed."" Lost souls in a canoe (heading straight for hell), an evil devil with crossed arms greets and ""Beer On Lees"" (beer on yeast) are all present on the label. Bottle refermented in a 750ml brown.  Appearance: Wood stain in colour. Pours extremely frothy, as a champagne, and settles into a thin creamy ring that clings to the sides of the glass. Some haze appears in the glass.  Smell: Spicy aromas, alcohol notes and fruity esters. Yeast aromas hit the nose as you get to the dregs of the bottle.  Taste: Whoa! This brew has some complexities! At first, fruit and higher kilned malt flavours coat the palate. Then, a sudden black pepper spiciness, tartness and fruitiness come into domination -- going spicy once again at the end. A very subtle hop flavour is noted which gives the brew some balance.  Notes: This is an outstanding Belgian-style ale! Comparable to a fine wine, easily accompanying most cuisine styles. Very drinkable for an 8% abv brew, a tease beer as you want more. If this is ""cursed"", damn us to hell!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Dubbel,93
