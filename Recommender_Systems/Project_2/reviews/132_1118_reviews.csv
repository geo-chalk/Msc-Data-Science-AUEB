132,1118,Pivopijak,3.62,"draught (nitro) IBU: 69 Velvety, tan head. Thick and bold, black looking elixir. Soft, dark and caramelized, roasted grains, for the aroma. Slightly watered down, dark roasted grain and dark chocolate flavor that is OK.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TheMatts,4.69,"This beer is really good. Beautiful opaque look with a smaller dark khaki head. First sip and you already taste the chocolate. This isn’t your normal dark chocolate stout, this is a milk chocolate flavor and it is good. Probably higher on the calories so probably only have one, but if you get the chance to try it, do it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,wadamslll,3.88,"Not really into chocolate but friend dropped off some stouts and this was one of them. Would not buy it but for what it is, it’s well crafted. Dessert beer. Makes me miss lagers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,VABA,4.25,Pours a very dark color with nice head and lacing Aroma has very generous dark chocolate hints The taste follows the nose with a well balanced very enriched chocolate flavor A medium bodied decently carbonated beer A good Stout,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Alieniloquium,3.53,On tap at Das Beer Garden. Black body with a nice creamy khaki head. Smells of cocoa and roasted malt. Tastes of cocoa and roar malt as well. Milk chocolate without the milk. Roasted malt and light bitterness in its stead. Medium body and very drinkable. Low carbonation. Hitting some of the old classics and this does not disappoint.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Sigmund,3.94,"1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Black colour, huge brown head. Sweetish aroma with strong notes of chocolate / cocoa, also notes of vanilla. Silky mouthfeel. The flavour is moderately sweet, again with dominant notes of chocolate / cocoa and vanilla, but also a distinct hoppy bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Not bad at all.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,maddogruss,3.84,"Notes from 2011. Had this on draft. A: pours dark brown, blackish body with small, tan head with ok retention and lacing S: smells like sweet, cocoa, dark chocolate; smells like a sweet chocolate bar T: bittersweet, like bakers chocolate taste; subtle alcohol notes; somewhat robitussiny; ok overall M: pretty smooth and solid D: nice mouthfeel and taste combo; good overall; a bit medicinal",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,penguinsgoboom,4.5,"A: Pours a nice rocky head. The head looks like chocolate milk so great start so far. Color is almost completely opaque. The little light that filters through shows a dark brown.  S: Smells of luscious chocolate. A good amount of sweetness, almost like frosting. Nice nuttiness and the malt character really comes through.  T: The cocoa is so present, but never seems to take center stage. The milky creaminess starts and is just so mellow. The roasted malts and the bitterness builds beautifully until the hop spice pops the bubble and clears the pallet. It finishes with a long drawn out chocolate aftertaste. The hops are a bit distracting and I honestly wished there was a lot less hops. It balances the drink and cleanses the palate, but I never feel like I get to fully bathe in the richness before being snapped out of it.  O: This is the adult version of a chocolate milk. So smooth, so drinkable. A clear flaw that changes this drink from indulgent to simply great.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,EMV,3.65,Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip  L: Dark pour... nearly black with big foamy mocha head. Great lacing.  S: Smells fantastic... big roast and milk chocolate.  T.F: Bittersweet roasted malts. Chocolate is present but not nearly as rich as the aroma would lead you to believe... kind of syrupy. Mild coffee... a bit of hop bittering and pine to boot. Lighter bodied than it should be. Fairly smooth. More bittersweet processed cocoa at the finish.  O: This was decidedly average... and nowhere near as good as the rating would have you believe. Looks good. Smells good. Taste... meh. There are WAY better chocolate stouts out there.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,entheos,3.3,"Disappointing. Smells and looks good, but the chocolate flavoring tastes like the chocolate syrup served at a buffet. I’ll skip this the next time I see it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,weissbock,4.35,"Great chocolate stout! i agree, balance between bitter/sweet is off to my palete, leans more bitter for style... not sure if it's Hopping or to much roasted malts.. i think overly hopped! but damn tasty. brown to tan head that lingers awhile, nice aroma, good chocolate in taste, medium mouth feel. carbonation right on! great, could be tweaked to super great! I've turned many people towards dark beer with this one! 50/50 men, women! their dubbel chocolate... an easy 5!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Donoman,4.28,"Beautiful very dark brown/black appearance. Nice tan head that stays thought drinking it also has great lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, slight smoke, and roasted malt. The taste is as described heavy chocolate taste upfront then the roasted malts and oats come through gets quite bitter on the finish. Too bitter in my opinion could do a better job of balancing the sweet and bitter. Mouth feel is smooth, creamy, medium bodied and quite dry on the finish, nice amount of carbanation.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,stevoj,4,Bomber from Albertsons. Near black pour with small creamy beige head. Rich dark chocolate aroma. Taste adds light bitter roast to the chocolate. Velvety feel.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Nass,4.03,The pour is jet black with a tan & frothy head. The aroma is of dark chocolate & roasted malts & the taste follows suit. If you're looking for stout with chocolate added to it then look no further because this beer delivers. There is a date on the front of the bottle. I like chocolate stouts but i'm more of a coffee stout drinkers so this beer I would not care to revisit. Cheers! A-,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RyanK252,3.98,"Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewing Co pint glass  A: Pours dark brown, nearly black, with a slight mahogany tint and a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a firm layer and leaves some thick lacing.  S: Lots of chocolate, cocoa powder, bittersweet, and milk, a little vanilla, roasted malt, a little char, a touch of smoke, earthy, slightly piney, toffee sweetness, and a hint of dark fruit.  T: Roasty, big bittersweet and milk chocolate, a little vanilla, some char and faint smoke, earthy piney bitterness, toffee sweetness, and a touch of dark fruit on the back end, mostly cherry and plum.  M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, slightly creamy.  O: Definitely lives up to the name, super chocolate-y. My main gripe is how assertive the bitterness is. I feel like if they backed it down 10+ IBU it would be even better.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,mintzmeet,4.56,"A stout can’t look better (thick beautiful lacing and head), and the smell hits you from arms length. Smells like a frosted metal cup you get the milkshake in. Great added chocolate, but isn’t sickly or sweet. Nice roasted malt and underlying stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,VoodooBear,3.88,"Presentation: 22 oz. brown bottle with no dates. Served in a snifter.  Appearance: The tan, two finger head stays around for a while and leaves some good, thick lacing in patches all over the glass. It's pure black.  Smell: The strongest scent is of sweet milk chocolate and brown sugar. There's some roasted malt and coffee in the background and that's it.  Taste: The taste is a little bitter at the start but then turns sweet. There's dark chocolate, blank coffee and roasted malt along with some milk chocolate, brown sugar and a slight hint of dried fruit  Mouthfeel: It's not cloying at all despite the sweetness. It's lighter than expected with a medium body and medium-high carbonation.  Overall: There's some rich chocolate notes both on the nose and palate that are very good. It's lacking in body a little bit but that keeps it from getting cloying. It's a very good beer but not great.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,elNopalero,4.4,"Sooo chocolatey. So, so chocolatey. Surprisingly delicious.  This pours the color of a dark roast coffee with a luscious cap of foam that builds and builds.

Tan head of small to medium bubbles, bit of lacing.  Delicious smell of malty Chocolate. Faint, almost sour Vanilla taint to the strong Malt.  Creamy cooking chocolate & vanilla aftertaste, with a mellow hop-coffee presence throughout. but at first a mighty Dark Chocolate crush! Simple yet not sleepy. well done, especially for the low booze %.  This certainly has a place in candy land valhalla!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,muchos,4.17,"L. Black. Light tan head which leaves a thick bubbly patch for a while. S. Sweet but well roasted malt, hint of espresso, chocolate brownie in the oven. More chocolate as it warms. T. Smooth chocolate charcoal. Light caramel and bready right away, deeply roasted to not quite burnt malt, sweetened dark chocolate comes and goes until it lingers on the finish, fruity light roast coffee comes through nicely in the middle, bitter with grassiness and pine in the end with a lingering cocoa. F. Medium leaning toward a full body, decent level of carbonation, pretty dry in the finish. O. Not a dessert, but well balanced with a surprising and pleasant bitterness in the back. I gotta try me some Rogue more often. Cheers ! ! !",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,HoppingMadMonk,4.21,"Nice above average body,just below average carbonation. Aroma is roasted malt,black coffee and cream,and some dark chocolate. Taste is very similar to aroma,as it warms it becomes more complex. It is mildly sweet yet with a slight dry finish and a bitter quality that lingers on the tongue and reminded me of burnt coffee and cream. Overall it was definitely too notch and an overall well made,flavorful beer",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,sokol_1993,4.08,"A great beer! Full of creamy chocolate taste and smell. Dark black. However, its aftertaste is a bit too dry, which preclude me from drinking too much in one sitting.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,dataslal,4.17,"The bitterness of the coffee notes may overwhelm palates sensitive to hoppiness or biterness. Very smooth mouth feel; round and reminiscent of cafe con leche. Decent nuttiness and roasted coffee bean notes that settle nicely. Overall, very well crafted.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Brutaltruth,4.15,"From the growler via Jungle Jim's and enjoyed in a snifter. This always welcome stout pours a nice dark murky brown with cola highlights and a very nice head of tan foam that subsides to a thick ring, thin light pool, and showcases some very nice lacing. Nose of dark sweet chocolate, medium char, earthy malt notes, subtle coffee, and subtle bittering hop notes. Flavors exceed with depth of character with a chocolate and creme brulee note mingling with char and smooth oats that are intertwined in mild coffee and a nice moderately bitter bittering hop note to bring this brew back to center. Very nice mouth feel; medium full body, light carbonation that is lively enough to give lift to the heft, and a chocolatey char touched finish with balanced hop notes.  Overall, a welcome and enjoyed brew for many years over----a Rogue classic.  Cheers",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,AyatollahGold,3.37,"Mocha/caramel colored head on a black beer but not pitch black. The nose is bitter chocolate & chocolate malts with some hop presence. Taste is a lot of chocolate with huge mocha as well. It's like really sweet chocolate coffee. Picking up a little bit of a metal taste as well. Not sure why. The feel is a little dry. Overall, it does have chocolate and the mocha notes are nice but there is something throwing it off a little bit to me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Lingenbrau,3.99,"If you read a label that states 'Chocoate Stout', you would hope it looks exactly like this. It's pitch black with deep brown highlights when lit. The frothy dark tan head resembles one that would cone from a root beer float, and it stays, and stays, and stays. Resting on top of the liquid below, proudly, and impressive. It plasters itself to the glass after each sip, and never abandons post.  This is where it makes or breaks, I believe. There is chocolate, and tons of it, no argument. But as some may welcome the nostalgic aroma, powdered malted milk chocolate makes me cringe, and that is exactly what I smell. Some burnt toast lies underneath, but I can't get those brightly colored fool wrapped chocolates out of my mind.  The flavor follows...kind of. It's not exactly reminiscent of those wretched bunnies or Santa's that we all know so we'll, but it is still detectable. The sweet chocolate ends up being cut through quickly by an indistinguishable roasted flavor, and then a loooooong lasting bitterness.  As mentioned, this shifts very quickly from immensely sweet to insanely bitter within seconds. It has a smooth and silky feel, but man that dirty bitterness is hard to look past.  It might seem like I dissected this beer negatively, but in fact I still enjoy Rogues Chocolate Stout quite a bit. I welcome a good sweet and equally bitter beer from time to time. No question that I hate the chocolate involved, irregardless of it's source, solely based on my interpretation. Overall, it's a chocolate stout...no question there. Cheers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Extraordinary.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,cdclark81,4.23,Great thick dark pour with a lasting head and great lacing. Strong chocolate smell with a bit of roasted malt. Great smoky chocolate flavor. Very smooth and easy to drink. Great beer.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,hopsputin,4.08,"a: the color on this is a very murky dark dark brown & black. real nice 2 finger dark tan head  s: loads of milk chocolate, roasted malt, sweet caramel malts, brown sugar, vanilla, and a touch of lactose. finish on the nose is more of the chocolate  t: like the nose, there is lads of milk chocolate in the flavor. behind that is a big roasted malt flavor, and some bitterness to go along with it. brown sugar and caramel follow the roasted flavor. behind that is more milk chocolate...like a chocolate powder flavor  m: medium mouthfeel. carbonation is about mid-level; not too much  o: chocolate is dominant in this, for sure. it is a sweet stout, but not the sweetest i've ever tasted. there is a nice balance in here provided by the roasted malts that counters the chocolate with a bit of bitterness. its not too cloying, and not too heavy. this is a nice beer which i would rate slightly above average",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Lone_Freighter,4,"It pours out a thick black with a one inch foamy tan head. The smell has milk chocolate up front with some nice vanilla entering in sweetly. Light malted roastiness comes through slowly as it warms. The taste is bitter and sweet in different aspects. The mouthfeel is mostly thick. It has about a medium sort of feel. It is fairly drinkable. Overall, this is pretty good. I like it and would come back again. Also, this goes great in brownies.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Squidretired,4.54,The nose came across very chocolate and somewhat malty. Chocolate and malt were the primary flavors. if you like the taste of chocolate in your stout then this is the one for you.

132,1118,Dakin,3.77,"Look: Dark brown with a sliver of a tan head.  Smell: Chocolate, roasted marshmallow, hops. Smells great!  Taste: Bitter chocolate, hops. Pretty bitter. Not too bad.

132,1118,Leif_Eriksson,4.04,"Look: dark, 45+srm. Creamy, healthy head.  Nose: cocoa, chocolate, malt, smoke  Taste: the chocolate comes through like a dark, bitter chocolate, which produces a drier tasting beer. Some smoke.  Delicious.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Radcpa,3.6,For a dark beer it has a thin appearance and a very mild aroma. The chocolate taste is minimal to say the least. I think this it also tastes artificial.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,HoodviewBrew,1.33,If I could give the taste 0 I would. Incredibly hoppy and estery for this type of beer. Zero chocolate taste that gives it its namesake. Bye-bye $8. It went down the drain.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bbtkd,3.65,"Rogue Chocolate Stout, 5.8% ABV, 69 IBU. Pours black and medium viscosity, no head because a taproom pour. Nose is chocolate sweetness, taste is moderate chocolate and a bitter close. Decent mouthfeel. Overall OK, but not as good as their double chocolate stout. While the chocolate nose is great, nothing matches the chocolate nose of a Samuel Smith Organic Chocolate Stout once the head clears.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,tekstr1der,3.7,"Disappointing as I really enjoy their double version. Pours dark with small brown head. Aroma is the best part with chocolate dominating as expected among the roast. Flavor does not follow. Initial chocolate fights to remain known through the sip, while semi-sour notes, and not quite matching hop bitterness takes over. Finish is a little biting. Could be smoother and sweeter to be enjoyable for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jaketaz,4.04,"The closest comparison would probably be Sam Smith chocolate stout, but this is cheaper and you get more of it. Pretty good bargain for a solid chocolate stout, I would say the best part of this beer is the full bodied feel. The taste is not up to par with some of the other mild chocolate stouts I've had, to say nothing of the stronger Imperial types such as those made by Great Divide, Stone, and Southern Tier. Nice dark color with a nearly white head, not completely opaque, little aroma. Good stuff, there are just a lot of better options.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Would gladly have it any day.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mkh012,3.89,"22 oz. bomber poured into a snifter. Pitch black with a finger of mocha head.  Deep bakers chocolate on the nose. A noticeable dose of piney hops as well.  Other reviewers have been quick to distance this one from sweeter chocolate stouts like Young's, and for good reason. At 69 IBU, this is quite hoppy for a chocolate stout. The dark chocolate is there mid-palate, but the finish is quite bitter. I wouldn't mind this, except it lingers. It's pretty much all I taste in between sips.  I understand why someone who finds a Sam Smith or a Young's too sweet would like this beer, but it's not my cup of tea. As I drink more of this, I hardly taste chocolate at all. Just vague roastiness and hops. If you're looking for sweet milk chocolate, look elsewhere. This is like eating a bar of 90% cocoa. That being said, it's an objectively solid stout that others will love. Just kind of missed the mark for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,devo1980,4.21,"A very decent chocolate stout. The chocolate is hidden, but shows up with a dark chocolate aftertaste. That was enjoyable. The rest underwhelmed me. I am surprised that this is getting 96-99 ratings. Pales in comparison to Sam Smith's Chocolate Stout. Overall a good beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,ChrisCage,4.52,"A- Pours black as black molasses, is thick and opaque in texture and the head is an amazing milky chocolate color, starting about one finger thick and retains very well! It is much too hard to see what is happening carbonation wise and as for the lacing, well it is superb in how it clings to the side of the glass!  S- A combination of dark and milk chocolate initially....it reminds me fully of what the Dairy Queen hot fudge smells like! There are dark and/or burnt malts noted, burnt brown sugar sweetness, fresh cocoa powder, dark roast coffee, vanilla bean...this is very scrumptious in aroma....dessert like!  T- Dark and milk chocolate covered cordial cherries, roasted nuts, such as hazelnut and burnt almond....bittering cocoa powder richness, black french roast coffee, and an overall black forest cake quality...not too sweet, but sweet enough. The finish is Earthy, dry, and just slightly bittering from black malts and hop cones! Very well rounded!  M/O- Solid medium body, velvety carbonation and full flavors make this an exquisite beer to enjoy with dessert or on its own....I love the chocolatey character and would most definitely seek this highly drinkable stout again! Highly recommended!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,rodbeermunch,4.33,"Dark brown pour, not the biggest stout in the world. 1/2"" light tan head. Aroma just kicks down the chocolate. This was the first real good chocolate added (not just chocolate malt) beer I had. And its still a staple in my fridge/cellar.  Taste is sweet, but not overly, mouth full of chocolate/cocao. Is a lighter grade of chocolate, this isn't the brownie batter or dark chocolate kind. More cocao.  I would love if they could drop these into 12oz six packs for ~$10. . .",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Sweet milk chocolate, light roastiness, wet paper aromas. Metallic tartness throughout, but quite a lot of chocolate in the middle, and roasty-toasty toward the back, as well as rindy and earthy hops, even a little booze in the finish.

132,1118,RickyS,4,"Pitch black, moderate head. The aroma is dominated by chocolate, milk chocolate, very sweet but pleasant. Little coffee notes. This is not a very rich aroma, but evidently promising and well balanced. The taste steers the experience toward a roasted character. Here I find roasted malts and a very dry finish, quite hoppy and sharp. Medium mouthfeel. Very tasty beer but I admit I expected more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,deebo,3.43,This is a big toasty roasty dark ass bomb. Black as night. Aroma is big time chocolate syrup-really inviting. Taste is Dark chocolate with a significant bitter bite/aftertaste this beer will make you earn it. Mouthfeel is fairly rough-not much smoothness which is the biggest defect. Overall-great appearance and aroma with a bit Ida too bitter finish and a lack of smooth body. Ok stout.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,JJKBeerLvr,4.4,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into pint glass in February 2016. There was no 'bottled by' date on the bottle.  Appearance: Very dark with nice thick brown head. Just a little lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: Pleasant, and can definitely smell the chocolate, but there is also some aroma of roasted malts, and a little vanilla and hops as well.  Taste: There is a strong chocolate flavor, but it is not too sweet. There is roasted malt and coffee influence and balanced with a little hops. It is a great balance that is not too bitter, nor too sweet. It is very creamy and smooth. The balance between the flavors is great, and not dominated by the chocolate.  Mouthfeel: This beer is very smooth and creamy with a nice aftertaste that is not too bitter or sweet.  This is an excellent stout. You will enjoy it if you like a smooth, bold stout with some chocolate and coffee flavors. It is complex, and every time I drink it, I get something new. Definitely a beer to drink again.

Not too sweet like a lot of chocolate stouts. It's real chocolate, not the sugary synthetic stuff. The hops are there on the back end. Nice bitter finish. This is still a beer drinkers beer.

The taste is lots of earthy hops followed by cocoa, oats, and scorched malt. Very bitter and drying, comparable to a RIS. The carbonation is below average and body is above average. Overall, it doesn't fit with other American Stouts, but has a great smell and taste, if you're expecting a dry beverage.

132,1118,Whiteweasel,4.41,"Poured from a 22oz bomber, drank from a seidel.  Appearance: Intense dark brown in colour, absolutely opaque. Frothy light brown aggressive head that leaves plenty of thick and intricate lacing down the sides. Visually edifying.  Smell: Semi-sweet chocolate is the most prominent scent, just like a glass of homemade Hershey's chocolate milk, followed after by moderately roasted barley. Hint of mocha, but overall balanced bitterness/sweetness.  Taste: Like a Hershey's chocolate milk mixed with a deeply bitter, roasted stout. Completely what someone might expect from the name. I think this is what I had hoped a Guinness would taste like when I was too young to drink beer. Really rich and grainy, and one of the most bitter stouts I've tried, but pairs well with the sweetness of the chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Has a rich malty sweetness that lingers on every surface of your mouth after you've swallowed it, pairing with the intense bitterness that is left as an aftertaste. Thick, richly satisfying mouthfeel, loudly broadcasts its heartiness. Low enough ABV to keep the boozy mouthfeel away, unlike darker, more evil imperial stouts.  Overall Notes: One of the best stouts I've come across: it's rich, chocolatey, bitter enough to balance the sweetness, and profoundly satisfying to drink. The chocolate can get a bit much once you've had a lot, but it's fantastic otherwise.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Wer34truh,4.19,"Black as night color, with a small dirty-white head. Looks the part.  Taste was bitter, and while chocolate was undoubtedly present, it was not as dominant as it often is in chocolate-branded beers. Also felt some raisins, licorice and coffee.  The initial taste is of roasted chocolate, a taste which retains for quite some time. While the roasted chocolate stays, coffee, sweetness and bitterness comes and goes throughout the experience. A well-nuanced taste!  Carbonation is low, and body is medium-light. Very drinkable.  Bough a 650ml bottle for $7. Good beer for a good price",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Back_in_the_Saddle,3.99,"This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a black color with a one finger off white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace leaving some clingy lacing on the glass and then sliding into the beer. The smell had a nice roasty to bitter coffee bean up front then a nice sweet fairly thick chocolate base rounding it out. The taste was mainly sweet with the touch of the roast and the bitter gliding into the aftertaste and finish. The mouthfeel was about a light to medium in body with a good sessionability about it. Carbonation runs nice for the style and for me. Overall, this was a nice American stout that I think I could have again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,StoutElk_92,4,"Pours black with a khaki head. Smells of faint chocolate and char. Tastes like roasted chocolate malts. Feels slightly thin with moderate carbonation.

132,1118,LikeAFishSince56,3.51,"This beer bought from a draft pub, looks like a stout. It is black with a half inch enduring head in a pint glass. The body is clear but opaque, and there is foamy lacing left as you drink it. The aromas are chocolatey and hoppy, but the taste and result is not really a stout. This beer is really an IPA in stout's clothing. A chocolate IPA I should think, not so much a chocolate stout. The finish is long and bitter, which is just fine if you enjoy IPAs as I do. The mouthfeel is a little weak, the alcohol punch substantial, and I don't feel like I've actually just drunk my thrice daily bread. I still prefer my Guinness.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BigDaddyWarbuxx,4.21,"Great initial aroma, with a strong chocolate presence. Fortunately it doesn't overplay its hand in the flavor, and keeps it mild enough to let the stout characteristics shine through, and be accentuated by the chocolate.

If you're looking for the same, you'd probably be disappointed. Some very chocolate beers are Samuel Smith's Organic Chocolate Stout and Lucky Girl Chocolate Dopplebock.  I surmise they used some very bitter dark chocolate in this brew.  Conclusion: Big bottle of awful.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,SitkaSteve,4.3,"This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking brown color with a beautiful and long lasting white to off white foamy head. Lacing is thick and foamy. The smell had a huge amount of chocolate running into roasted nuts, and light coffee. The taste is mainly sweet through the chocolate. Light amounts of roasty nuttiness and bitter coffee helps to balance. The mouthfeel sat about medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation is light allowing the chocolate be the body. Overall, why look elsewhere for a chocolate stout. Sure the hops are low for the ""American style"" but when you drink this as a sipper in the winter, there's nothing like it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,vladdswrath,4.33,"Beautiful black pour with a sticky three-finger head which left tons of lacing as it slowly died down. Smell is pure hot chocolate powder. Both were the highlights of this beer. The taste certainly did not disappoint, but it wasn't quite as engaging as I thought it would be. Still, it's a great desert beer that also improves as it warms, so my taste rating might be a little higher, as I may have started this one too cold.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Taste - The chocolate starts and remains as the star player with some coffee bits.  Feel - Creamy without being too thin. No carbonation.

132,1118,ShawnMN,4.72,One of my favorite stouts! Creamy caremelly head. Smell of chocolate and dark roasted malts. Great feel on the pallet with just enough carbonation to give it a little kick and ehance the chocolatey dark roasted malty flavor. Little hint of a caramelized malt stickiness to the taste as well. Man what a great brew !,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,T_Mob,4.94,"Appearance: Pours a thick, rich liquid that's more impenetrably blackish brown than any other beer I've seen. Brownish head is not much but extremely dense and slow to dissipate  Smell: Chocolate hits at the forefront but it's right alongside some slight oatmeal/coffee smells like those that are common with porters.  Taste: Absolutely amazing taste from the very second it hits your lips. Immense mouthfeel, and generally just one of the richest taste profiles I've ever had in a chocolate stout. It's chocolatey beyond belief but also balanced with just about everything I love about stouts/porters being at least slightly involved in the mix here. A bit of coffee, a bit of oatmeal, a bit of caramel, but still chocolate is at the center here. Everything else plays a huge role though, and it just feels creamy and rich as anything here. It's very powerful in its level of chocolate, the density and power of its taste, the chocolate taste, the way the other flavors influence but never overwhelm... I seriously just want to keep taking huge gulps of this. It's insane. There's not much to be said about the flavor changing much throughout the swallow, it's pretty much just a richly accented chocolate stout through and through, but the chocolate flavor definitely does develop from biting cocoa to chocolate milk to dark chocolate bitterness throughout its mouthful, and there's a slight coffee taste that shows up and lingers on the back-end. I personally think it's an all-around perfect beer, but I feel like the taste and mouthfeel at least are undeniably perfect for a stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Spiff,3.85,Dark Chocolate - with understandable choco bitterness on end - one of our tasters thought the chocolate was more like cough syrup - but he is old. 2 out of three liked it - the third (the old man) walked out and we haven't seen him since.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Black in color with brown tint. A few small white particles can be seen casted throughout the brew. Very srong aromas of chocolate with mild aromas of roasted barley and earthy tones. Flavor reciprocates the aroma (except that roasted barley flavors are strong instead of mild) with all flavors entering the palate simultaneously. Previously undetected by the nose, mild hops enter the palate after intial flavors to create a splendid balance. Full-bodied, extremely creamy, incredidbly smooth, with little carbonation combine to create a near perfect mouthfeel.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Nice chocolate flavors, yet has a nice hop backbone too. Since I primarily drink IPA's, that was a good quality to have in a stout like this. Pours almost black with a picturesque head.  Overall, taking my feelings about the style into consideration, it's still a wonderful beer and if I was in the mood for a stout I would probably go for this.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mzingie,3.85,"Beatiful head and dark black color. Smells extremely hippy for a stout. Taste matches the smell. The chocolate character is a bit overwhelmed by the happiness and makes it hard to distinguish. Mouthfeel is fitting for the taste, perfectly smooth. This one is just too hippy and light for what I'm looking for when I want a chocolate stout. Still a good beer and I will buy it again if I am looking for a stout with bold hop flavor.

132,1118,Grant_Satterthwaite,4.87,"I didn't pour it, I just drank it from a bomber during a gig my band and I were playing. First off, I'm going to assume it looked fantastic like most rogue beers. What I can attest to is the taste and the feel. There's no shortage of chocolate in this bad boy. Some bitter sweet notes of chocolate, even coffee, and roasted malts. The feel is nice and smooth which is typical of stouts since they have less carbonation. As the beer warmed (since I drank it between songs) the chocolate became even more pronounced and the feel also became smoother. Honestly this is by far one of the greatest beers I've had in my life. I'm a sucker for rogue beers and this one is way way up the list.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,hreb,3.73,"A true classic. How have I not rated this already? 22oz bottle served in a stout glass. Beer pours as black as expected and forms a medium brown head. Mild cocoa aroma atop bittersweet chocolate flavor, with just a kiss of hops familiar to an American stout. The chocolate brings up both the levels of bitter and sweet. The result is really tasty and drinkable. Not as sweet as Young's double chocolate, and pairs way better with dessert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,doktorhops,4.45,"Wow, there’s a Chocolate Stout from Rogue I haven’t tried yet... I’m sure it was merely an oversight on my behalf, I love Chocolate Stouts, in fact the name of my beer review blog was almost going to be ILCS (I Love Chocolate Stouts) however I Hate Macros seemed a bit of a better fit - it encompassed brews that weren’t specifically Chocolate Stouts and also increased my hits with web users that hate MS Office [you’ll have to think about that one for a moment dear reader]. In any case Rogue, what can I say about them that hasn’t already been said by others? They’re a brewer with more craft pedigree than you can poke a stick at, and one of the few brewers that experiment with weird/wonderful ingredients*, they got moxy.  Poured from a 650ml bottle into a nonic pint.  A: “Welcome to the dark side of the beer” I think to myself with Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars’s voice in my head. A delicious inky black body with a 1cm mocha head... and the prize goes to: Rogue! 9/10.  S: Milk chocolate upfront, as it damn well should be, with a solid biscuit malt base, oats, a touch of earthiness, along with some choc-chip cookie for good measure - “I’m going to enjoy this!” (Freddy Quimby from The Simpsons). 9/10.  T: Yep, a solid Chocolate Stout FTW! This is one tasty chocolate brew, though I would recommend letting it warm a little as I drank this fairly chilled and it was muted as a result, but damn: the flavours are there and they’re great; milk chocolate, biscuit malts, oats, cookie, vanilla and a slight roasted/light bitter character towards the end - this is one Stout that spoils you like a kid at Easter. 9/10.  M: Medium bodied with a slightly gassy carbonation. I had a burp, and I shouldn’t with a Stout. This is the only smudge against an otherwise awesome brew. 8/10.  D: Certainly a brew I will be getting again... and again... and again... and possibly again... but after that no more for a while... then just as I think I won’t get it again - I get it again. Rogue Chocolate Stout is up there with Amager Bryghus & Cigar City’s Xiquic as one of my favourite chocolate beers, and praise well-earned that is and indeed high, mmm [I’m doing a Yoda voice now]. 9/10.  Food match: Chocolate pie, if indeed such a thing exists, with Chantilly cream (if indeed such a thing exists).  *Check out my tasty review of their Voodoo Doughnut Pretzel, Raspberry & Chocolate Ale on BeerAdvocate and hopefully one day: this blog.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,TheCraftBrewReview,4.35,"Rogue’s “Chocolate Stout” fondly brings back memories of the Winter Stout Tasting event that Nicholas Publicover and I attended a month ago, where he was entranced and firmly suggested that this was the beer of the night. According to him, despite other offerings that night having a higher ABV or different additives, the simplicity and drinkability of this beer put it over the top. An award winning beer and one of the flagship brews from Rogue, I was exceptionally excited to get my hand on another full 22oz bottle of this and put my feet up in front of a fire. Was it as good as I remembered?  Appearance – 94: The stout poured with a thicker head than I remembered (likely in part to all of those high ABV selections we drank last time that I referred to previously!), roughly a half inch thick with caramel/mocha colored bubbles that clung to the edge of the bottle. The color is pitch black and allows no light to penetrate it at all. Slight lacing was evident as well.  Aroma – 94: As one might imagine, the smell of the beer mimics the ingredients used – malts and chocolate. An earthen tone also hints at the roasted barley and rolled oats element, which became more prevalent once the beer hit my tongue.  Body & Texture – 93: As the beer is made with high quality imported chocolate, the first taste (as I’m sure you’d imagine) is of dark chocolate with a hint of milky-vanilla. After a moment a roasted coffee sensation kicks in, before departing to the earthen elements that I suggested earlier. A surprisingly complex amount of flavors given the limited ingredients. Slight carbonation also plays on the palate, which is fun!  Taste – 95: If the Nestle Quick bunny decided to make an alcoholic beverage, this would be it. Everything promised in the description delivers, and then some. Chocolate taste? Prevalent, strong, but not overpowering. Stout element? Certainly. Malted and roasted notes, with tremendous flavor in a great combination. Couldn’t have been more impressed with this selection.  Overall – 94.3 (Excellent): Tasting this beer again after a brief hiatus reminded me of what I was missing, similar to a short breakup with a girlfriend. Holy smokes, what a fantastic beer! If you remotely enjoy chocolate OR stouts (and especially both), you owe it to yourself to sample this beverage. Extremely easy to drink, delicious, and delivering on every level, there is no doubt that several bottles of this will find it to my basement to age. Incredible!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,theIPAman,4.12,"A great gift brought by guests to a dinner party. Ads stouts are her favorite beer style, my wife got to contribute to this review....a rarity. Pours a deep black licorice with a pretty coffee brown bubbly head that dissipates, but returns with a gentle swirl of the glass. The scent is of toasted malt and leaves a reminder of chocolate milk. The taste is of bitter dark chocolate, a hint of coffee, and a faint caramel aftertaste. Some creaminess, but also a nice carbonation. Slightly sweet, especially late. We've had chocolatier stouts, but this was nicely balanced and really quite well done.

Pours an easy and incredible 2 finger head with no vigorous pouring, leaves whispy lacing on the glass. Head is a dark tan color, looks like I'm pouring a cherry Coke. S - Smells EXACTLY like a caramel macchiato, very strong caramel, coffee and dark chocolate notes in the smell with a slight bock aromas backing it all up. T - Imagine when you were a kid drinking Nesquick chocolate milk. Imagine if they made a more adult, dark chocolate powder, this beer has that taste. This may come off unspeaking but it is a very good think, extremely delicious with hints of coffee and caramel. Extremely long finish, flavors stay resident in the mouth for quite some time.

The mouthfeel is on the thin side, there really isn't a great deal of body to go with the big aroma, but at 6% abv I guess I shouldn't have expected much more. There is a nice roast quality as well as a toasted nut thing, but not a lot of bitterness.

Pour is black with maybe some brown mixed in when held to the light and has a frothy cinnamon colored head of about 1 finger that gives way to some nice lacing. Aromas of strong dark chocolate, roasted malts, marshmallow, fudge. Taste starts off with smooth creamy chocolate and ends dry and bitter with more lingering dark chocolate and roasted malts. Its almost like drinking a melted dark chocolate candy bar. The bitterness of the chocolate really sticks on your tongue! Mouthfeel is surprising light in body but perfect for this style.

S: Smell is of chocolate malts, with a bit of a toasty/nuttiness. Also clean, citrusy hops that stack up fairly well to the chocolate malts.  T: The taste is mainly chocolate maltiness with a good amount of citrusy hop flavors. Very good balance between the malts and hops.  M: Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth for the high amount of carbonation.  O: This is a very well balanced stout with good chocolate flavors and a clean, crisp finish from the hops.

Standard Rogue packaging, which is always good. Beautiful looking presentation.  Smell - Roasted malts, chocolate, cocoa, deliciousness, vanilla, and sweetness. The smell is right up front, no deception here.  Taste - Almost like an alcoholic chocolate milk. The delicious roasted malts and chocolate balance each other out nicely, keeping the sweetness from getting too out of control. Other flavors such as vanilla play bit roles on the palate, but the malts and chocolate are primary. And they are delicious  Mouthfeel - Smooth, rich, and thick. The same qualities I like in a woman I like in a beer, and this has it.  Overall - Drink this beer immediately, preferably with your buddies or by yourself in front of a fire on a cold night. It is excellent.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,the_awesometeer,4.26,"Appearance - Pitch black with a nice foamy head which laces the glass very well  Smell - I just smell the sweet chocolate.  Moutfeel - Very smooth, light carbonation.  Taste - The chocolate taste is first but it is not as overwhelmingly sweet as i thought it would be. It actually had a nice balance to it with a little bitterness.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,PhillyJ,4.75,Great go to chocolate stout. the new rebel hop really gives it a bitter finish that isn't quite as subtle as the discontinued 9 ingredient cascade hop version. I think the ibu on this new version is underrated but this stout is great being as it's not an imperial/double stout it has a slightly thin mouthful and a modest 6%abv but it makes up with chocolaty goodness from beginning to end.. I recommend this beer and I believe it shines as it warms as do most stouts I recommend a slight chill our pull it out of the fridge and let it sit and warm a bit I enjoy it from a balloon so it warms in my hand.. the slight complexity that is there can be easily missed if it's to cold and it will really mask the bitter chocolate taste...,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Brewhemoth,3.96,"From a bomber into a pint.  A: Pours black, with a creamy tan head. Very nice head retention. Decent lacing. No visible activity. S: Chocolate and roasty malt. Quite sweet (chocolate) in the nose, some oats and vanilla. T: Roasty, and very chocolatey. Enough bitterness to finish and balance out the sweetness, but definitely not overpowering. M: Medium bodied. Drinks smooth. Coats the mouth very nicely. A moderately dry finish. Expected it to be fuller bodied. Carbonation is also a little more present as an after taste tingle as opposed to the initial.  Overall: Very nice, but not necessarily what i expected. The chocolate aspect i thought was phenomenal, but lighter bodied and too one sided for my liking. Very good though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,xboxhueg,4.5,"Pours pitch black, no light getting through whatsoever . BIG chocolate and roasted smell. Taste is drier than the smell led me to believe, but that is nice since this is so rich. Mouthfeel is heavy as $^!@, super thick like a shake. Thick, dense, creaming head that sticks around forever and coats the entire glass as you drink. This is a great chocolate stout, around the same enjoyment as Samuel Smith's for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,seedyone,4.57,"02/21/15 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Great, great stout. Listed as a sweet stout, but I don't find that. The chocolate is prevelant, but since it's bittersweet, the kids won'tbe licking the chalis. If you appreciate the newer take on stout (bless Guiness & their legacy) you should find this a treat.  The color is black as pitch. The aroma is all chocolate, but more nibs than Hershey's. Taste is great balance of sweet & adult stuff...not masking a bitter or burn...just well rounded. Respectable mouthfeel that adds to the overall enjoyment. The only peeps that will be frowny faced are those that need a head/lacing to validate.  Pull up a stool, ask for a pint, grab the glass & just let this take it where it will. Just keep an open mind & there will be no regrets. Promise.  05/09/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC.

Smell is a sweet chocolate and molasses note. Very sweet cocoa-ish, some roastiness. Kind of one dimensional smell, however it is very nice.  Taste is very clean and robust. Lots of chocolate in this one, however not sweet like youngs double chocolate stout. Excellent.  Feel is real good, nice carb, right in the middle of the road.

132,1118,beerdrifter,4.25,"Pitch black pour with a creamy two finger beige head with good retention and great lacing. The nose is huge and really lives up to the name. Tons of cocoa and dark chocolate along with hints of milk chocolate, oats, and vanilla. The taste follows suit with the chocolate again dominating, but with a distinct bitterness. Hints of cocoa, caramel, leather, vanilla, oats, and roasty coffee. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with medium carbonation and a dry, bittersweet finish. Overall, this surprised me as I was expecting a sweet and syrupy artificial mess, but instead got a much more natural tasting chocolate stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Completely opaque, appears to have medium to light carbonation. Body looks on the lighter side.  S: Very interesting unexpected nose, rich dark chocolate, coco nibs, refined sugar, truffle, chocolate syrup, and molasses. Pronounced oat aroma, very creamy (yes that’s a smell). Sweet and succulent  T: Liquid dark chocolate, rich, sweet while also bringing bitterness from baker’s chocolate - Malt character is solid, sweet and lightly roasted. Caramel notes come and go throughout, good balance and subdued hop profile. Spots of sweetness from some un-metabolized sugars. Oat and truffle elements mesh resulting in a grainy dryness. Cappuccino overtones without being too coffee forward. Chocolate blast that’s very sweet, almost overwhelming.  M: Body fits the appearance, but I think it’s too light. Carbonation is light and fine, after taste sticks around, sweet and lightly chocolaty, quite similar to a mocha cappuccino.  O: Pretty beer, love the bronze/copper head, solid retention and collaring dress the glass nicely. Very sweet, probably works best for a desert or after dinner sipper. I wish the viscosity were ramped up a bit. Very rich chocolate presence, boarder line overwhelming. Reminiscent of Southern Tier’s works. Tasty sipper.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,WoodBrew,4.37,"A pretty dark stout color with a strong mocha colored head. The lace thin but very strong and stained the glass big time as I drank the brew down. Very nice to look at. Nose was (guess) chocolate, candied sugar, caramel nougat, and a little rum-like ester. All were appetizing to smell, but none were presented or combined in an impressive way. Taste was (guess) chocolate and candied sugar. Had a dry hoppy finish but of the bitter sort you'd find in good chocolate. Even better was its almost fruity espresso flavors in the middle of its flavor profile. The mouthfeel was thin with a fizz that came from the head and hops. A very straightforward beer but by no means boring and one of the better stouts out of the six famous and beeradvocate highly-ranked ones I've had recently. Simple and simply edible, this is a tasty stout I am welcome to return to. With a way too easy mouthfeel, and skilled brewing, its a beer version of milk chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Soft, creamy looking head that dissipates nearly entirely, but clings to the edge of the glass. Left little to no lacing on my glass. 4/5  Aroma Thick, and heavy with the smell of chocolate. Not a coco smell, but the smell of chocolate syrup. No hop aroma at all. 4/5  Flavor Light, roasted barley with a slight crispness. Flavor is clean and free of esters. The chocolate flavor is not as overwhelming as the aroma would suggest. Carbonation is on the smoother side, pleasant, and not too abrasive. Has a smooth, creamy finish, and the roasted chocolaty flavors finish well with a pleasant slightly bitter aftertaste.

132,1118,GuinnessRegular92,4.35,Personally this Rogue beer is the only worth trying Rogue beer out there. I have tried a couple other kinds of theirs and this one was the only one that tasted exactly like it was advertised. Very good Chocolate Stout for those out there that like their Stouts actually sweet with Chocolate versus the Oatmeal or bitter taste.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,schoolboy,4.21,"This is the best of the Father's Day gifts! I think. Best of the new ones. Maybe. It's a really great chocolate stout! That I know.  It looks great in a glass, with large bubbles and lace. Unusually large, actually. The aroma is a bit sharp and chocolatey. The taste is rich - intense, complex, bitter and slightly sweet (much less than some). It is not boozy or strong tasting in any way. Very well balanced and easy drinking.  It has a non-creamy mouthfeel. It is so missing that big chocolate stoutness, but it has a great easier drinking vibe. I can easily finish the bomber and live to drink something else afterwards.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Still unsure of Rogue yeast tho to this palate with overall aftertaste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

I poured the beer and it looked fantastic. I am a fan of stouts so I had high hopes. I took a whiff and the beer impressed me once again. It was only when I proceeded to take a taste that I realized that this was not my brew. The initial taste was delightful but then easily overpowered by strong hints of cocoa powder. I read the bottle and they hit the nail on the head by describing it as ""chocolate truffle."" Too choco for me. I would recommend to a friend. Merely for kicks- as a novelty beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

I will have this regularly.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Bottle chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured into a english pint glass.

The taste is to be expected. Lots of chocolate and roasted malts! Just a slight bitter aftertaste, which is from the various hops. The ""9 ingredients: 2-Row, C-120 & Chocolate Malts, Cascade Hops, Rolled Oats, Roasted Barley, Chocolate, Free Range Coastal Water and Pacman Yeast"" is written on the right side of the bottle. If you like chocolate stouts that is loaded with taste, then this is for you. First 'Rogue 'that I have had and they make several different types. Overall a enjoyable brew.

Taste: Definitely like the aroma. Chocolate up front with some chewy malts, roastiness, bitterness, earth, and a char.

It is well crafted. The nose is pure chocolate and the taste is nicely complex. The main problem I have is that the nose suggest something sweet and what you get at first is sour and bitter.

Head settled to a thin layer that stayed around a while. Lacing on the side of the glass.  Chocolatey scent over the head, as advertised. Not much else.  Taste: Bittersweet dark chocolate. More on the bitter side than the sweet side. Not too bad. The bottle label says 69 IBU.  Moderately strong carbonation.

132,1118,Thehuntmaster,2.84,"650ml bottle 6,0% Abv. Served chilled and split between a snifter and a wine glass. No Bottle date.  Appearance: Rogue Chocolate stout appears pitch black in the glass , with a strong backlight only revealing a little deep red along the edges of the glass (this stuff is pretty dark for the Abv.). A standard pour yields a massive dark tan coloured head. The head displays fantastic retention and leaves beautiful rings of lacing clinging to the glass as it slowly recedes.  Smell: Given all the great reviews, the nose is actually quite disappointing. There is a fair amount of chocolate, but it seems somewhat fake and more like chocolate flavour than actual chocolate. Other notes include: Oats, toasted malt and some creamy caramel.  Taste: As with the nose the flavour is rather disappointing. There isn't a ton of flavour and the beer comes across as somewhat watery. There is a fair amount of (fake) chocolate flavour, some roasted malt, a toasty character and a pleasant bitterness on the back end.  Mouthfeel: Blegh, this doesn't work at all, the body is thin and watery. The carbonation is okayish at a medium-high level but it is a little harsh.  Overall: Another shitty beer from Rogue, I can't see I'll be buying anything more from these guys.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

T: Dark chocolate, roasted barley, nice hop kick to it, has a beautiful dark chocolate aftertaste. Awesome beer.  M: Full bodied, good carbonation which is great so you won't feel full. Has an oily finish.  O: Super tasty chocolate stout that's not overly sweet. Many different flavors come out and all have their fair share of presence in your mouth. Go out and buy this!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S- Chocolate and more chocolate nose. Maybe a hint of roasted grain. No, wait, that's more chocolate. A bit of marshmallow cream in there too.  T- Roasted grain bitterness up front, washed away by sweet creamy chocolate, dark chocolate, and other exotic chocolate flavors, along with a touch of mocha/coffee on the back. Familiar Rogue PacMan yeast there too.  M- Creamy smooth to start, with grain and a little hop bitterness, passing into a coffee-like tang.

No light getting through.  Nose is definitely dark chocolate and coder up front with a slight underlying dark fruitiness. Definitely some molasses and earth notes. Really nice smelling stuff.  Big hit of dark bitter cacao up front supported by bitter earthy hops then accentuated by a nice creamy and milky mouthfeel. There's still a nice hint if fruity esters and a nutty quality.

132,1118,joe1510,4.45,"22oz. Bomber $4.99 Health Mart  Finally getting around to trying this. It's been on my list to pick up many times but I always seem to pass it by, since it's always available, in favor of seasonals or special releases. Poured black with a big 3 finger brown, creamy, ruddy head. I can't see a thing through this beer. Leaves spotty lacing throughout the entire drink.  This stuff smells amazing. Big notes of chocolate and cream. Mildly roasted barley and a small hint of coffee beans. Smells like dessert in a bottle. Fantastic!  Flavor has all the qualities of the aroma with a little extra. Starts off with the creamy milk chocolate. Roasted malts and coffee grounds come through mid-palate as the chocolate starts to fall back. On the swallow there's a mild hop spiciness and coffee ground bitterness.  Medium bodied and somewhat creamy. Lively in the back of the throat. My only complaint, and it's a very small one, is the mouthfeel could stand to be a little more creamy. Still very nice though.  This chocolate stout is an easy one to put back. Wonderful flavor and aromas make it a pleasure to drink.  I'm surprised at how good this stout really is. I wasn't sure if it could live to the hype or not. I wish I would have picked this up sooner.

Taste: chocolate syrupy feel as wash over my tongue with a light carbonation and succulent bitterness, (enough too make my mouth water for a second sip,) at mid tongue and the finish is warm and mellow. ABV at 6% but this larger bottle was very fulfilling to me. I would definitely not share this bottle with anyone unless she looked like Penelope Cruz.  Definitely on my nice list!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Jugs_McGhee,3.19,"Reviewed live. Reviewed as an American Stout because it self-identifies as a chocolate stout and it's American. Okay label art. ""Made with imported chocolate."" 69 IBU. 15 degrees plato. 650ml brown glass bottle with standard branded pry-off cap acquired at a local Vons grocery in Santa Monica for $3.99 and served into a flared stem-snifter/tulip hybrid glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Expectations are above average since it's on the beers of fame.  Served chilled, straight from me fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a two finger wide head of khaki-tan colour. Nice creaminess and thickness. Little lacing as the head recedes. Head retention is well above average - about 3-4 minutes.  Body colour is a predictable solid opaque black; dark but not a jet black per se. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show.  Standard fare for the style. Not unique or special. No obvious flaws.  Sm: Cocoa powder/dust, chocolate malt, dark malts, caramel, buried light roast. Not getting any coffee, vanilla, or molasses. Hop character is present yet generic; hopping is primarily preservative here. Sweet. No yeast character or alcohol is detectable. An above average to mild strength aroma.  T: Dark malts and chocolate malts dominate, but there is a slight hint of roast just before the climax that dies almost immediately. Definitely on the sweeter end of the sweet/bitter spectrum. Stale cocoa dust. Oats. Fairly balanced, but there's room for improvement. Would definitely benefit from more complexity and subtlety. I do like it in a general sense. By no means mind-blowing. The chocolate itself isn't particularly rich or evocative; sort of a generic crumbly milk chocolate with heavy cocoa powder notes.  No coffee or vanilla. Lacks flavour diversity, depth, and intensity. Flavour duration is good.  Mf: Smooth, wet, and slightly soft. Good thickness. Nice creaminess for what it is. Good carbonation. Not biting, harsh, gushed, or oily. Suits the flavour profile generally well, but doesn't come off custom-tailored to it. Not syrupy. Decent body.  The soft texture is a highlight.  Dr: Very drinkable; I'll have no trouble finishing the bottle. Fairly priced at $4.00 USD per bottle; I'd definitely get it on-draught at this price. For a beer of fame though, it's not horribly impressive. A pretty decent offering from Rogue, but it's far from mind blowing. I wouldn't want more than one in any given night. Tasty but forgettable. Rogue makes better beers. Hides its ABV well.  High C+",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jrenihan,3.82,"Beer is jet black with a small cocoa-coloured head. Head fades fairly quickly but not entirely.  Nose contains chocolate- surprise, surprise. Roast malt. Nothing else, but a nice smell.  Like the smell, the taste contains chocolate and roast malt. A bit of a hoppy flavour, slight citrus. Almost tastes like bitter orange. Fairly bitter finish. Taste a bit thin.  Medium bodied, thinner than expected. Strongly carbonated, a bit too much.  Overall, not bad, but not as good as I had hoped.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ChestSplitter,3.5,"Poured out of a bottle. Pours almost black with a brown head that didn't stick around for long. Smells a little like chocolate but also some malt/coffee aromas too. Not a really big smell. Taste has strong hints of chocolate but not nearly the chocolate blast of the Rogue Double Chocolate Stout. More bitter at the finish then I expected, given the start. Mouthfeel is really not very thick for a stout, but maybe I should have expected as much given 6% ABV.  Overall a pleasant chocolate stout. If you really want a thicker, chewier chocolate blast, the Rogue Double Chocolate Stout is better, but this is more balanced. It was better overall then the sum of its parts.  And one food pairing suggestion: raw chocolate chip cookie dough with this beer is a revelation.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,MickeyD,3.11,poured into a clean pint glass  A: very dark with thick head which was dark in color.  S: I didn't smell much slight dark roasted malt no real decernable chocolate smell.  T: I only tasted a slight roasted coffee taste typical of a stout no real chocolate taste at all. Slightly hoppy.  M: heavy and creamy  O: I know this has gotten some really good ratings but I don't see why. There was very little taste to this beer and the chocolate didn't add anything to it as far as I was concerned.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Sludgeman,3.22,"Poured into a chalice. Rogue does not print freshness info on the bottle.  Not the rich, sweet, smooth beer taste I was expecting based on the aroma. Did I get an old bottle? There was little to no sweetness. This beer needs better balance. A disappointment for me. You should try this beer if you are a stout fan, which I am, but not again for me.  A – Pours a clear reddish brown with a one-finger rocky tan head.  S - Milk chocolate, followed by coffee with some sweetness.  T – Coffee, some roasted bitterness, a bit of alcohol, a bit thin (-)  MF – Thin, dry, a little astringent (-), minerally.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,AmishLightning,4.57,"Well I been looking forward to this beer for quite some time now. I drank it during a hotter afternoon and in hide-sight was probably a mistake. A cooler evening or sometime during the fall would have been a better time. Anyway, I was not disappointed in the results.  A-A pour showed me a thick dark syrupy liquid hit my glass with no remorse. The initial head that formed was almost comically large. I had to wait until it settled down a bit before the normal head formed before I could finish pouring it. Three fingered head with a craggy top. Jet black color. Not even lighter on the sides. Just BLACK and just the way it should be.  S-Coffee, chocolate, and aroma hops hit the nose. I felt like it was a combination of a chocolate frappe and a hoppier beer.  T-Dang, that is good. A surprise hop bitterness pounces at you and leaves you with a roasted chocolate flavor to mull over in your taste buds for a minute or two. Even as I'm writing this I feel as I can still taste the lingering flavors. Initial bitterness was under control despite an IBU of 69!  M-Thick. I probably should have used a spoon to drink it. It really let you know you were drinking a stout, and not just any stout but a Rogue's Chocolate Stout.  O-I really enjoyed this one. Quite thick, quite sweet, and quite dominant. I stout that runs up to you, gets in your face, and demands that you like it; despite the fact that the hardcore beer drinkers think its a sissy beer because contains chocolate. A bold and brash boss who lets you know who is in the building.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,AlCaponeJunior,3.79,"Pretty good looking, pretty blackish, except you can see a little light getting through on the pour, leaving a nice brown lasting head with some pretty good lacing.  Aroma is quite chocolatey. I get a lot of chocolate and not a whole lot else, except for maybe a touch of roasty notes and a tinge of coffee.  Flavors come out as more complex than the nose, with a good blend of bitter, chocolate (dark and milk), sweetness, coffee, burnt, roasty and toasty notes. It's quite tasty, with a good bit of complexity. The bitterness is pretty high, but it blends with the sweetness and cocoa/chocolate flavors well.  Body is pretty thick and chewy, with a bit of an bitter, dark semi-sweet chocolate aftertaste.  I really like these thick and rich stouts that aren't jam packed full of alcohol. This is a good one, I would certainly have it again. I can't remember if I like it better than their regular oatmeal stout or not, as it's been a while. I recall liking it tho, and I would guess this one is somewhat similar in overall nature.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,SDbrewerJake,3.91,This beer had a nice scent to it... Not sure if cocoa nibs was used or just the chocolate malt but either way i couldnt get the scent right. Taste had a overpowering smoked flavor that had a alcohol finish. I wanted more chocolate but overall not a bad stout... Just not their best. I would stick with their oatmeal stout.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,REVZEB,4.04,"A clean and classic chocolate stout. Has brownie like chocolate with oat, vanilla and lush malts. Body does cloy a little, but good consistency.

132,1118,mporter249,3.74,"Appearance: Dark, black, with a tall, fluffy, tan head. Looks pretty good.  Smell: Chocolate, a little bit bitter, smells a little like coffee.  Taste: The chocolate seems to come towards the end of the taste. There's a bit of bitterness, then a touch of sweet, followed by the roasty, chocolate taste.  Mouthfeel: Definitely a heavier beer, and a little coarse. A good bit of carbonation, and it's nice.  Overall: This is pretty good. I'm not sure I like it as much as Samuel Smith's chocolate stout, but that may also be because I'm new to this style.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,dar482,3.51,"The beer comes in black color with a light fluffy tan head.  The aroma is fantastic. Just big milk chocolate bomb with the smell with some malt.  The taste is pretty good. I wish it was silkier like other bigger ABV stouts. It surely has more chocolate flavor than Young’s Double Chocolate. It then finishes with a bit of a hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is a bit light.  It’s not exactly my style as I prefer a creamier, milkier chocolate stout like some Russian Imperials or American Double stouts. It’s more of a well rounded beer with a hint of chocolate.

132,1118,archyquaffer,4.17,"Poured from a bomber into an 8 ounce sampling glass. The label states that the beer is made with imported chocolate. Rolled oats are also an ingredient. No freshness date is apparent. A moderate pour produces a 1/2 inch, light brown head that reduces quickly, leaving some marbly lacing that sticks a little to the glass. The beer is a very dark brown which almost lets no light escape...  You can really smell the chocolate, and possibly also hazel nuts- the beer reminds me of this brewery's brown ale, which is excellent. The hops are not real apparent in the aroma, but show up well in the taste and aftertaste, and seem to mesh perfectly with the chocolate flavor without overpowering anything. This was somewhat surprising, given the high number of IBUs (69). Despite the rather aggressive flavors/aromas, a hearty dose of roasted malt flavors and textures shine through. The beer is fairly dense in body but not as dense as one might expect, based on the color and other qualities.  I tend to balk at spending over 5 dollars for a bomber of beer, but I've never been disappointed with a Rogue product, and consider the money as well-spent.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S: The nose is Vanilla, milk chocolate, and a touch of marshmallow. Smells great.  T: This beer is nice and sweet. I get milk chocolate and vanilla right up front, but it's not overpowering. Sweet, but not too sweet. As it moves to the middle I get some roast and bitters on the back end. It's well balanced.  M: Full bodied beer. It's smooth, coating, but not too sticky. The sweetness hits the palate first but it transitions wonderfully into bitters as it fades.  O: Very nice beer. I didn't have a lot of expectations for this beer, so I am pretty darn impressed. The flavors are great, it's sweet but not overpowering, it's a great dessert beer.

Good lacing is left down the glass.  S: There's a decent chocolate character backed by some roasted malts and citrusy hops. The chocolate is sweet, though a touch off putting. Far from bad, though.  T: Chocolate gives way to a roasted barley finish, laced with some bitter hops. It strikes a better balance than the double version. All in all, the flavor profile is simple, but not cloying.  M: It's dry and light...at first. This initial sensation cleanses the chocolate sweetness well, however it doesn't fully clean it up. Therefore, it strikes me as unfocused, as it's caught between 'dessert beer' or 'drinkable dry stout'.  O: This would make a rock-solid everyday stout if it were A) in 6 packs and B) less expensive. It's still a decent offering, and better than the double.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Dark and milk chocolate smell with a sweet sugar cane almost maple smell along with a nice vanilla hint.  T- Follows the nose, this beer has a lot of chocolate flavor. With a nice hops bitter finish which gives this beer a higher IBU.  M- My only complaint about this beer. It has a medium body feeling with a lot of carbonation. I would like there to be more thickness and velvet texture. Keep in mind this is just my thought on it.  O- I really like this beer. It is a light stout that can be enjoyed any day. This beer really has both sides of the equation. It has the nice robust chocolate taste upfront followed by a bitter hoppy aftertaste which makes this beer very well-rounded and enjoyable to most beer drinkers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,FLima,4.25,"Deep black color with a thick caramel head with good retention. Aroma of milky chocolate and cocoa powder, it becomes quite interesting and stronger once it warms up. In its taste, there is a bold chocolate flavor that shows upfront and with a good deal of hops to balance it. Also malty, yeasty and condimented. Dry and bitter aftertaste with its lingering taste. Full body with good carbonation. A bit oily. You really don’t fell the 69 IBUs. Great stout and well balanced, not overly complex, focusing on what is promising: chocolate.

T: The taste reverses the smell, with toasted malt making its appearance at the forefront, but with just the subtlest hint of dark chocolate in company with hops in good balance, appearing most plainly on the finish.  M: This beer's mouthfeel doesn't quite match its good looks, smell and taste, and was somewhat thinner and more sparse than I expected, though it is accompanied by a pleasant amount of carbonation.  O: Competent, if not complex, the components of this beer don't, for me, add up to an outstanding whole.

132,1118,MaximalC,3.84,"Pours seal brown with a modest mocha head of coarse bubbles. Aroma smells of milk and dark chocolates, coffee, and citric hops. Flavor is surprisingly mild considering the aroma. I'm thinking this may require considerable warming to get the most out of it. For now, I'm getting a well balanced blend of roasted malt (tending toward coffee) and earthy, citric hops. A delightful mocha haze sneaks up late in the aftertaste. Some milk chocolate is there, but it's very faint in comparison to the more acrid elements. To be honest, I'd be hard-pressed to brand this a chocolate stout when I think of the many stouts out there with a far great chocolate character. Even Rogue's own Shakespeare Stout has a stronger chocolate presence in my opinion. I had this a couple years ago and recall having much the same impression. The mouthfeel is pretty zippy, perhaps a little too much so for the style. With that said, this remains a drinkable stout with a nice roasted character, albeit short on the eponymous chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,KYGunner,4.25,"Black as coal and yielding no light there's a ton of carbonation that creates a frothy soapy brown head.  The scent has pure milk chocolate, creamy and sweet, but I'm reminded of hot cocoa with a layer of marshmallows floating atop. Bits of caramel or toffee with a graham crackery, marshmallow aroma fill the nose.  The taste is dry, chocolatey with a strong burnt maltiness. Touches of coffee mix with the chocolate and present an espresso creaminess. There's some watery tones that end with a metal like feel at the aftertaste but its not so off-putting as to keep one from enjoying a really good stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,StonedTrippin,4.46,"as good as a chocolate stout can get. this is divine. pours a velvety dark brown color with a thick milkshake head, mocha in color, sudsy and lasting. the nose is a mix of milk and dark chocolate, not overly sweet, but definitely real chocolate. well roasted malts are nice and dark and earthy, but not burnt to the point of being bitter. the flavor is remarkably chocolate heavy. its almost like youngs, but the sweetness isn't as intense thankfully. there is a very organic nature to this. its like adult dessert, I really like it. not incredibly complex, but more of a simple and straightforward brew, with little to distract the drinker from the robust chocolate flavors and smooth creamy feel. everything is balanced perfectly, the flavors here are just fantastic. full body, amazingly smooth, and it changes from cold to warm quite a bit. carbonation is mellow all the way through, just enough to wash it down clean. overall this might be the best beer rogue makes, and that's saying something!

Pours a beautiful dark brown that's near-black in this light, with a decent head and resultant lacing. Aroma of Nesquik over dark roasted malts. The taste starts mild followed by a big bang of chocolate milk in the middle, with nice cocoa and coffee tones in the finish. An enjoyably drastic bitterness rounds out the flavours.  Not subtle and perhaps not real sessionable, but a definite pleasure to drink for this chocolate lover. Well done, Rogue!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Swedgin_Wu,3.61,"Very pricey at $9 for a 22 oz bottle.  A- pours very well. Nice deep black with a dark khaki head. IMHO there's not a huge variation between many stouts. they tend to have the same color..only difference is in the head and lacing if any.  S-Smells of dark malts, chocolate (more prominent as the beer warms), and definitely a strong aroma of grassy hops.  T-This is a very hoppy beer. someone else mentioned that it's not a real chocolate stout..it's an IPA/Chocolate stout hybrid, and i would say it's a fair assessment. The hops jump out at you from the start. The chocolate is more in the finish and the bitterness of the dark chocolate smooths out the hoppiness somehow. This is not my idea of a chocolate stout but it does work somewhat well considerably how heavily hopped it is.  M- Seems like there's a quite bit of carbonation in it. Medium mouthfeel. the carbonation makes it harder to drink  O - This beer seems really overrated, partially because i tend to think BA is in love with hoppy beers non matter what the style and partially because of Rogue's reputation for good brews. This is not even in my top 5 of chocolate stouts and not in my top of 10 stouts. I like hops in an IPA, not my chocolate stouts.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

It's a darker chocolate flavor and smells absolutely delicious. Taste is surprisingly hoppy and bitter but the dark chocolate flavor softens the blow. This is almost like a cross between an IPA and a stout. The hops bring a slight sting while the chocolate and oats add creaminess to the palate. Mouth is very creamy.

132,1118,BulbousBeer,3.8,"This in my mind is not really a stout, it is a IPA/stout hybrid. I love a hoppy beer when I order one but a stout should not taste like this, a stout is more about the malt not the hops, I would of probably loved it if I was not expecting a stout. Forgetting what this beer is supposed to be, it has good chocolate and coffee flavors, but the body is a little lacking, it is actually a pleasant drink. But i'd rather of had a actual stout.  Second tasting. After trying this a second time, I have changed my mind. Being from the UK I am used to a British style of stout, as that was what I was expecting I was disappointed. This time around I took a more open minded sip. This is actually a very tasty and balanced beer, i still find it some what a hybrid to my tastes but a real tasty one.

132,1118,Converge,4.16,"Bomber into a tulip.  A - Pours a deep, dark cola hue with slight red highlights while going into the glass, but once in there it looks completely black. Big billowy dark tan head of large bubbles. Excellent head retention and sticky chunks of foam cling to the glass on all sides.  S - Certainly a chocolate stout! Cocoa nibs, bittersweet and inviting give it a big chocolatey character, with hints of caramel malt and vanilla in the background. Not quite as rich or complex as I had anticipated, and there are some crisp hops that feel a tad out of place. The roast is there, but mild, and certainly doesn't hint to 70 IBU. Still, this is a nose to behold, with as much chocolate character as any beer I've had before.  T - Well, there were definitely some IBUs hiding in there somewhere after all. Profile starts of with lots of chocolate, cocoa, and a hint of vanilla at the front of the palate, then soon gives way to a more robust, bitter mid-palate and finish. Roasted barley, charred malt, and coffee roast all come through and last into the finish, along with some subtle, earthy hops. Not quite the chocolate punch the nose had me believe, but a great, well-rounded and balanced brew.  M - Body is medium weight and lively with carbonation, a little too lively for my liking in fact. The bubbles feel overly large, detracting from the smoothness. Typically if a stout is going to have this much carbonation, I like to see finer bubbles to keep the texture smooth and creamy.  D - Enjoyable chocolate stout, but probably not my first choice for the style. Overall it was certainly worth trying, but I'd still put it below DDC's Aphrodisiaque.

Mellowed quite a bit as it warmed up and came off a bit creamier and sweeter.  M: Full bodied and a bit dry with light carbonation.  O: A good chocolate stout.

132,1118,mfnmbvp,3.75,"650 ml bottle, no bottled on date present, uncapped and poured to a Boulevard tulip glass. Excited to try this beer, as it will be my first stout from Rogue.  A - Pours dark as the night, no light is visible shining through. Nice finger and a half of mocha colored head chillin on top, that goes down quick.  S - Deep dark fire melted chocolate smell is prevalent for damn sure. Smells fresh, potent, and wonderful. Hint of vanilla bean in there, but ultimately the chocolate is the dominant feature of the nose. More of a coffee smell begins to creep out as the beer begins to warm.  T - Rich creamy chocolate hits you right away, and finishes with a nice subtle enhanced roasted coffee bean flavor. Very nice, to be sure. Again, as the beer warms the coffee bean flavor begins creeping out more, slightly overwhelming on the chocolate, which should be more highlighted than it is.  M - Creamy smooth mouthfeel. Dark coffee bean flavors linger around on the palate for a minute. A full-bodied beer, but doesn't sit as heavy as some beers do.  Overall, I definitely think it is a stout worth trying, but there are better chocolate stouts out there. This was the first one I've had by Rogue, and it was about what I expected it to be. A thoroughly enjoyable stout, although I'm no stout expert, so don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself.  Personally, I'm following this up with a shot of the Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey, which is going to be the real treat. Cheers, friends!

132,1118,TheDinger,4.17,"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Great looking opaque/black pour with a nice adequate 1+ finger mocca head. Smell was baking chocolates up front with semi-sweet chocolate on the back. Fits the name and that's what I was looking for. Maybe some burnt malts stuffed in there, but huge chocolate. Taste was melted chocolate bars with a little hop finish. Again, some dark fruits/malts are there, but the chocolate takes center stage on this chocolate stout bomb. I get a blend of different chocolate which is nice. Baking, semi sweet and dark combination. Feel is middle of the road and quite silky/creamy. Mild carbonation on this which is just fine. Overall- It is what it is! A chocolate stout with not a ton of bells and whistles. If you like chocolate in your beer, this is right there for you. Not over the top, but a good sipper and pretty enjoyable. A solid effort that hit the spot for me. Not the best out there, but work the try-",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A - Cracked it open and poured (with a slightly heavy wrist) into my pint glass. Looks good. DARK brown - almost black - even in the light. Not much head (1/3 inch even with the slightly agitated pour) but a nice tan color.  S - Maltiness... Chocolate.... Nuttiness... Coffee? In that order. hmmmm, let's see how it performs  T - I left a little dinner on my plate, skipped desert, and passed on sweats all day for this?!? Where's the chocolate? I taste an average-stout, with average maltiness, and some hints of chocolate and nuts. A little too hoppy.  M - Oily / watery stout. Slightly under-carbonated. Not exactly pleasing to the palate.  Look, I understand the paradigm that chocolate stouts should not be over-chocolatey, however, this is will be a disappointment to anyone looking for an even-slightly sweet treat. It was drinkable, but boring. According to the website, this stout is:  ""Ebony in color with a rich creamy head. The mellow flavor of oats, chocolate malts and real chocolate are balanced perfectly with the right amount of hops for a bitter-sweet finish.""  -Color was ebony, but the creamy head was not. -Oats? No. -Chocolate malts and real chocolate? Meh, malts and a hint of chocolate. -Too much hops making the beer more bitter than sweet.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Beer_Runner,4.12,"Bottling date: none  A: A fairly aggressive pour into a standard pint glass produced about two fingers of light mocha colored and clumpy head. After several minutes this head dissipated to a collar and did not leave any lacing. The beer is a deep, dark infinite ebony and absolutely opaque.  S: The aroma is very strong and consists of rich chocolate and malt sweetness, roasted oats and barley, and just a little underlying earthy hops.  T: The taste has elements of unsweetened chocolate, dark roasted oats and barley with just a little bit of carbon char; and, there is also some earthy and just slightly spicy hops.  M: The body is fairly light with a very smooth and creamy feel. And, there is only a little carbonation which fits just right with this beer.  O: This is truly a chocolate tasting chocolate stout. Yet, since the chocolate has an unsweetened character it fits really well into really good oatmeal stout. The result of this combination is a pleasing blend and balance of unsweetened chocolate and dark roasted grains along with the some earthy and slightly spicy hops to add complexity.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Surprisingly sweet aroma, almost 90% pure chocolate scent  T - Bitter, roasty flavor comes out on top, sort of an oaky black character, with a chocolatey sweetness hovering behind it all. Roasted stout flavor all over, not as much chocolate as a dark coffee stout profile.  M - Plenty thick, somewhat syrupy, active foam carbonation. Good and chewy, doesn't disappoint on mouthfeel.  O - Good beer. Great beer, in fact. Just didn't deliver much on it's promise. Did it smell chocolatey? Oh yes. Did it taste chocolatey? ...perhaps. Same as most stout, it had that roasted, dark chocolate character. But unfortunately, it wasn't much of anything special.

132,1118,KajII,4.12,"[Suggested Glassware: Nonic Pint]  The pour was a very dark muddy brown almost black with an average (1-2 finger) medium brown rocky head that receded steadily, down to a thin film with a large collar and had fair spotty lacing.  The aroma was loaded with chocolate right up front along with some burnt malts, a light resin hop and a doughy yeast and had notes of coffee, dark chocolate and a mild nutty presence.  Taste was bitter sweet and malty with a note of dark chocolate in the beginning, and then became moderately bitter with a bold dose of coffee and yes more bitter chocolate towards the finish. The flavor hung around for quite a long time after the swallow, with a very bitter mocha coffee taste left lying on the taste buds.

It's truly like drinking the chocolate truffles rolled in quality cocoa powder I made with some left over gonosh I had, but in liquid form! This is delish! A perfect dessert beer for sure.

A - Dark coffee brown and dense, less creamy than other stouts I've had lately and the froth dissipates quickly.  S - Slightly nutty, very prominent chocolate tones. No hop or malt character on the nose, nor alcohol.  T - Toasted nuts and chocolate initially, with the chocolate lingering. Sweet and the alcohol is well hidden.  M - Extremely clean for a Stout, no oiliness or burn. Consistent mouthfeel throughout the swallow, nothing surprising in this one. Decent.  O - The perfect beer for dessert, a great 'Mood"" beer.

Second, invest in some larger bottles for home brew that will cut down on my bottling time. I have tried some of the other Rogue styles in the past and have not been overly impressed but when I tried the Rogue Chocolate Stout I was blown away. In review, I do not know how this brew can be improved. I have purposely stayed away from some of the other Rogue styles in the past but chocolate stout is a home run.

There was a 1.5 finger, dirty-brown head that recedes slowly leaving a thick ring around the edge of the glass.  S-Cocoa and, uh, chocolate, obviously. Milk chocolate to light-dark chocolate to be exact. The smell is pretty concentrated on those flavors, but I got a whiff of roasted malts and oats.  T-Mostly follows the chocolatey smell, but a bit more bitter. I got a bit of smoke, which makes the chocolate notes almost like semi-sweet chocolate. There was a bit of nutty flavor on the finish.  M-The beer leans toward heavy, but not nearly as oily or heavy as an RIS.  O-As advertised, this is a chocolate stout, and a good one at that. Is this the best chocolate stout out there? No, but if you want to sip on a dessert beer that won't bowl you over with ABV, this is a nice choice in complexity and taste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

This is a contender for first prize of stouts with especially another Oregon stout - Obsidian!  Let's get to the review. Appearance? Black black like purple black with a creamy tan head that won't quit. 5.0.  The aroma of chocolate fills your senses so much that I had to give it a 5.0 too just for its sheer strength.  The taste is a strong stout melded with chocolate. Lotsa chocolate. The chocolate shows up on the first taste. Stronger chocolate flavor than even Young's Double chocolate. I don't know if this is my favorite stout.

132,1118,JamesMN,3.95,"Appearance: Very viscous pour produced a three finger light brown head atop an opaque black body. Laces well.  Aroma: Like an Oatmeal Stout with that added chocolate factor. Sweet and slightly roasty notes.  Taste: Interestingly enough the biggest flavor I get here is a smoky and similar to tobacco. It's not a bad thing per say, just not what I was expecting. I think what I'm tasting is a combination of dark roasted chocolate and the hops. At 69 IBUs the beer leaves a distinct, but by no means overwhelming, bitterness in the finish. As I get further into the beer, that tobacco flavor is fading and the chocolate profile is emerging. 6% ABV actually seems low for how thick and robust this beer drinks.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly thick, between medium and full bodied. Average drinkability and a little too much carbonation for the style.  Final Thoughts: Although the flavor profile on this one was not quite what I was expecting, it's a unique change of pace from the usual Chocolate Stout. Would I drink it again? Probably not, an interesting beer but not one I feel the need to revisit.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,ABisonEgo,4.2,"Poured into a 14 ounce snifter  Appearance - pitch black with a 2 finger tan head. no lacing on glass, head retention is quite lasting.  Aroma - dark chocolate and roasted malts. A sweeter milk chocolate does somewhat cut through on the nose with hints of vanilla making its mark.  Taste - I am more impressed with the aroma on this one. A bittersweet chocolate taste comes through with a semi lingering roasty finish. You do get some hints of vanilla in the middle of the tongue, but the aroma does come off a little sweeter. Not too overpowering of a roasted note to this one, and the bitterness in the finish is balanced enough with the malts that it does not plague the tongue with an overly bitter flavor.  Mouthfeel - Medium carbonation on this one. Not silky smooth by any means, but with a medium body and a semi creaminess to it, its not bad. Wish it were a little lighter on the carbonation and had a little bit more of a heavier/creamier mouthfeel.  Overall - Not bad. This is rated higher than southern tiers ""choklat"", but overall, i think choklat does a better job of nailing what i would want out of a chocolate beer. This is definitely better than a lot of stouts advertised as chocolate stouts, and for the price, its pretty damn solid. I do love the vanilla flavor that compliments the chocolate and the lack of overly bitter malts to give it that easy drinking feel.

Kind of crisp in the middle with a lingering malt bitter chocolate finish. There is a mild hop undertone throughout. Delicious.  The only problem I have with this beer is mouthfeel.

Straightforward and no nonsense, even though it does have chocolate in it. Makes up for its lack of complexity with balanced chocolate and malt flavor. Some nuttiness in there.  M: Just like a good stout should be. Creamy, almost milky. A decent amount of carbonation that doesn't quite make it through because of the rich body, but it's perfectly ""there.""  O: This isn't just a novelty beer like I assumed at first, but it's really good and solid. Although chocolate and stout isn't the most creative combination in the world, it is definitely done well in this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,GMB,4.92,"The bottle tells us that this beer is made with ""imported chocolate."" If ever there were a beer to give us reason to consider the Reinheitsgebot as outdated, this beer is it.  Rogue Chocolate Stout pours a very deep, ebony body with a cappuccino head. When this beer is held up against a strong light source, orange and red hues are only barely visible at the top and bottom of the glass.  The nose is outstanding. Intense aromas of dark-roasted malt and dark chocolate mingle with floral notes that are both spicy and resinous.  The taste of this beer something that I'll crave in the coming weeks. As the nose suggested, the dark-roasted malt are at the fore, and come together in perfect balance with the bittering hops to create the flavor of coffee. Moreover, a perfect balance of hoppy bitterness, roasted malt and chocolate flavor, produces the distinct flavor of a mocha. This is the beer's main flavor base, in relief against which floral, peppery, and citrusy notes dance on the palate. The alcohol content is key here. It warms the palate just enough to complete the sensation of a warm mocha, and complements the hoppy aromatics with notes of dried fruits (e.g., raisins, figs, dried apricots, and prunes) without confusing or neutralizing them.  The mouthfeel is a just a bit gassier, which is to say sharper, than I would like. Its body is full and luscious; a perfect complement to its chocolatey taste. If only the foam on my tongue were as luscious and creamy as the beer's flavor demands...  I was fortunate to have had a handful of roasted nuts, dark and golden raisins, and a couple of chipotle chocolate almonds on hand as I enjoyed this beer. If you feel so inclined, I urge you to try any (or all) of these as snack pairings.  Why the perfect overall score despite the imperfect mouthfeel? Because the imperfection is so slight, and because Rogue's Chocolate Stout is not only among the best Chocolate Stouts out there, it is also among the best beers I've ever had.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mattbk,4.05,"Poured into a brewmaster's stout glass.  A- Deep black, huge cascading head, tan, very long retention. S- Chocolate, roast, slight hop bitterness, slight vanilla. Good. T- Very nice. Roast for sure, followed by a solid, but not overwheleming chocolate flavor. Bitterness, likely from the dark malts. Creamy, almost milkshake like. The roast malt teeters on the edge of acidic, but not quite offensive. Maybe a bit more bitter than expected, the chocolate is a dark bitter chocolate rather than a sweet milk chocolate. Nothing amazing here, but very solid. M- Love the mouthfeel here, so creamy, full, but not too full. Nice head, but not too carbonated. O- A solid Amercan stout, not overwhelmingly good, but a very safe choice for any occasion calling for a dark beer. Would go great in the winter while watching the hockey game.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smell- Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate.  Taste- Dark chocolate with roasted malts and a piney hop balance. My only gripe is that I wish the chocolate flavor was a little bit sweeter.  Mouthfeel- Nice thick mouthfeel with easy drinkability.  Overall- A very tasty stout that hits the mark. My only nit pick is that since it's called chocolate stout that it could be just a smidge sweeter.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,dbrauneis,4.23,"A: Pours an opaque jet black in color with some notes of dark brown and amber when held up to the light and some moderate amounts of visible carbonation near the surface. The beer has a quarter finger tall dark mocha head that quickly reduces to a thin film covering about 50% of the surface of the beer with a small patch of larger bubbles and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.  S: Moderate to strong aromas of milk chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, and cocoa powder. There are some subtler hints of dark roasted malts as well.  T: Very similar to the smell, the taste of this beer is dominated by the flavors of chocolate - both milk chocolate and cocoa powder. There is an underlying flavor of dark roasted malt which imparts a light amount of bitterness, which lingers slightly.  M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth and creamy.  O: Easy to drink and very enjoyable, one of the more sessionable chocolate stouts I have tried. There is a very pleasant flavor with just enough complexity. A very enticing aroma to bring you in.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Patrick2012,4.58,Served in 16 oz. tulip glass  A: Pitch black with great big dark mocha colored head.  S: All I can honestly really smell is a strong cocoa aroma and maybe a little bit of hops. most of the scents are overpowered by the chocolate. its like smelling a bottle of hersheys syrup. not very complex but very good aroma  T: Bitter and hoppy that counters with a little sweetnes. the blend with chocolate gives it a bit of an espresso taste to it. Very nice. smooth and creamy. Love this a lot.  M: Hoppy bitterness and a bit of chocolate linger on my tongue. tastes very good.  O: delicious beer that I see myself picking up at bevmo every now and again. Highly recommended.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Falcon91Wolvrn03,4.4,"Appearance – Opaque super dark blackish brown, with a thick, creamy, chocolaty brown head. Spotted lacing.  Smell – Chocolate and cocoa powder - that pretty much sums it up. Sweet chocolate rather than bitter; reminds me of Nestle quick (in a good way).  Taste – Chocolate and malts; a bittersweet chocolate taste that I didn’t pick up in the nose.  Mouthfeel – Lightly carbonated, a little thin (not a bad thing), silky, with a nice chocolaty aftertaste.  Drinkability – This is a highly drinkable beer. A great American stout!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Not really any roasty notes. A sweet stout with some nice bitterness to balance out the sweetness  M- Like chocolate syrup, smooth, prickly carbonation, finished dry, medium to full bodied  O- Nice sweet stout with different chocolate notes in the taste and aroma. Great smooth mouthfeel too.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Hopswagger,4.24,"P:  Dark black body with brown amber edges crowned with thick chocolate milk head that fades fast.   S:  The nose comes through with rich chocolate silk pie aroma, bittersweet dark cocoa and milk chocolate. Oreos, non dairy creamer, no bake cookies, and roasted barley.   T/M:  Medium-full body that is sticky and has a sting of carbonation on the tip of the tongue. The taste is more bitter chocolate than the sweet creamy nose.  The roasted barley, and rolled oats welcome the dark cocoa bitterness, while room temp coffee layers the roof of my mouth. The barley may actually be overpowering the cocoa. The finish is dry and after some time leaves a faint cinnamon biscotti presence.   O:  Rogue has created a nice chocolate stout that I could smell all day. The upsetting part is that it is not transferred to the taste so much. Heavy roasted barley fades the rich cocoa flavor. This does not create a total loss however for this stout is still rather tasty. This would be a great stout to have around Christmas time next to a crackling fire.

132,1118,TheRealBigC,3.88,"Kind of surprised with this one. Was expecting a creamier brew. This one is a standard American stout, done very well, but for me it doesn't totally live up to the name. The chocolate is there, but it's very bittersweet. I say baker's chocolate and really high percentage cacao bars. A whole different kind of bitter compared to hops, but quite bitter. No doubt it's a unique one, and a very good one, but as far as chocolate stouts go, Young's handily beats this one because it is brewed in the milk/sweet style, which I think lends itself better to the chocolate. I feel like I'm kind of underscoring it, but you get my point.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mjtiernan,3.98,"22oz bottle poured into a short-stemmed tulip. No idea on the date, but should be a fairly recent bottle.  A: Super black body with a frothy dark brown one-finger head. Good head retention.  S: Heavy chocolate...more of the milk variety than dark or semi-sweet. Cafe au lait. Faint alcohol. Maybe a tiny bit of pepper or anise.  T: A modest dose of chocolate up front. Not as much as you might think from the aroma. Mid palate has a pronounced smoke, pepper and woody/tobacco profile. Some bitter hoppiness in the finish.  M: A little on the thin side, but there’s just barely enough creamy mouthfeel to pull it off. Actually pretty easy to drink if you aren’t put off by the earthiness aspect (which I’m not).  O: This was quite a bit different than I expected. Not really a chocolate bomb like Choklat. I’d be more likely to pair it with a cigar than a dessert. I’m not in love with it, but I could easily see myself craving aspects of the flavor profile at some point down the road.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,CraftBeerTastic,3.93,"Ba Review #210 Served On: 08/15/2012 Glassware: Pint Glass Labeled ABV: - Date/ Code: -  Grabbed this one at Wegmans in Mechanicsburg, PA back on my birthday last year (December). The 22oz. bomber has been in my cellar until today.  Look: Poured a pitch black with a huge 3-finger rocky tan head. Carbonation level was undetectable through the black color. Overall appearance was fantastic.  Smell: Notes of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Some earthy hops came through with some hints of juniper. A maple scent was also noticeable.  Taste: First was a sweet rustic character reminiscent of a burning pile of dry fall leaves. The middle was a smooth black coffee with a semisweet dark chocolate that lead into a dull roasted finish that eventually became more of a charred oak note.  This was a wonderful stout. I was expecting a little more sweetness, but the charred character was actually rather interesting. I can’t speak to what the cellar actually did for the beer, but it certainly didn’t seem to hurt anything.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TBoneJones,4.55,"Nearly pitch-black with a robust slightly tan head.  Smells of chocolate, roasty.  Creamy feel with a cocoa taste that lingers slighty bitter. Lacing just clings to the pint glass. Carbonation and the silk, i enjoy the mouthfeel. High drinkability even as it warms a bit. Not bad paired up with chocolate frozen yogurt and dark chocolate coffee beans, in this case (the latter especially blends in with the aftertaste, which seems of chocolaty coffee grinds to me). In the end, a burnt cocoa brew that is not too sweet and is very easy to drink. I want to try Rogue's double of this. ",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,KVNBGRY,4.73,"Ordered this on accident while eating at a favorite fondue restaurant. It poured a dark, velvety chocolate brown. The head was equally as velvety smooth, caramel color.

Smell is of chocolate malt, cocoa powder, chocolate syrup, and milk chocolate aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, char, unsweetened dark chocolate, cocoa powder, and raw cocoa nibs. There is a high level of roasty bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

A nice two finger off brown head with some good cling and lace.  Smell- Huge malty roast notes with plenty of rich creamy chocolate on the nose. A bit of a semi-sweet aromas come up as well.  Taste- It was a chocolate stout, but didnt pound you over the face with it. I liked it better before I took a bit of the cake. Once I did it was a bit more hoppy and bitter. A bit prickly at points and semi-smooth. A tad bit of coffee flavors on the back.  Mouth- A lighter medium body with a light medium semi creamy carbonation. A touch prickly and bitter on the finish.

Aromas of big chocolate, toffee, caramel, molasses, roasted malt, vanilla, cream, and light herbal hops. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength; very dessert-like. Taste of chocolate, roasted malt, toast, oats, caramel, toffee, cream, light coffee, earth, and herbal hops. Fair amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toffee, toast, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit.

132,1118,KellyL,4.87,"Served in a snifter, poured from a bomber.  Appearance – Dark brown, almost black. Faint amounts of light penetrated only the very edges. Poured straight into the middle of the snifter. Thick tan head formed quickly and faded slowly to just the edges. Very minimal lacing.  Smell – Big hints of chocolate, slight roasted malt and very minute hop aroma. It almost smells like toll house chocolate chips.  Taste – Nice roasty flavor up front. Big chocolate notes in the middle and finish. The roasted malt blends perfectly with the chocolate. Slight residual sweetness, but overall it is reminiscent of semi-sweet chocolate. At the very end a slight toffee flavor finishes the sip off.  Mouthfeel – Creamy. Lends a nice character to the beer, almost like drinking dark chocolate milk... But better.  Overall –An almost perfect example. Perfectly balanced. A little more head retention would make it perfect. Rouge has done yet to make a beer that I can't appreciate. It's apparent to me as a home brewer that they spend a lot of time on recipe formulation before releasing a beer.

132,1118,Darkmagus82,4.29,"Served in a 10 oz chalice glass  Appearance – Served a deep-deep brown color with a very small light tan head. The head faded very fast leaving almost no lacing.  Smell – A nice aroma of chocolate with some roasted malt notes mixed in are the biggest. These create a slightly semi-sweet chocolate smell when mixed with a lighter sweeter aroma of toffee and milk.  Taste – The taste is of a roasted malt with a good deal of dark chocolate up front. As the taste advances it sweetens some with the toffee flavors coming to the tongue. This toffee creates a more milk chocolate/semi-sweet chocolate bar like flavor in the middle of the taste which, as time advances further continues to strengthen. It is a very satisfying flavor that carries to the end, where some coffee flavors bitter the taste a bit and leave a very satisfying coffee infused dark chocolate flavor on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the creamier side with the carbonation level being on the lower side. Both suit the flavor profile of the beer quite well and allow all the chocolaty flavors to be sensed by the tongue.  Overall –A very nice chocolate stout that is very easy to drink.

Once the head settles down, it’s time to dig in. Well, chocolate is the overpowering flavor. This makes for a nice dessert beer, but probably would not pair well with food. Other flavors come and go; coffee has some prominence. There is a bit of bitter to the aftertaste, surprise, like dark chocolate. Not a super thick brew, but not highly drinkable because of the strong chocolate flavor. I would love to try this brew fresh on tap someday.

I've had a lot of this beer during my years in Portland, and so this pour in New Jersey gets me closer to home.  I paired this bomber with my steak. I wondered whether the chocolate would work with the red meat, and it really did a good job. Now I continue to sip this as a dessert. One detraction in my meal, don't serve this with pickles (my fault, not the beer's).  Overall this is a very good stout. The name serves it very well. You get a soft chocolate flavor in the nose, taste, and across the palatte in the texture.  This beer is spot on. I recommend it.

Dark khaki head is minimal in stature but adds and extra piece of attraction to the overall look.  S-Smells like liquified milk chocolate. Behind the chocolate fondue aroma is light roast. They really nailed the chocolate here. So pure and intense.  T-Literally tastes like a Hershey bar melted to pure liquid. In the liquid chocolate seems to be a quick but generous pour of coffee. The taste is pretty awesome. It is one-sided but it is supposed to be. Really cool  M-Full feel with mellow carbonation. Feel and flavor match well and complement one another.  O/D-This is a chocolate explosion in a glass. I truly enjoyed this brew. I liked it a lot more that Southern Tier's Choklat. I found this one to be more of a pure chocolate flavor.

Beautiful darkest brown, big creamy chocolate head, lace, really good looking beer. Smells, what else, milk chocolate. Nice mix of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, roasted malts, even some hops leading to a nice bittersweet finish. Nice and creamy on the palate, at the end of a (too) long day, I would have preferred 16 oz serving though.

T: When I think chocolate stout, this is what I want. An great balance between dark chocolate and malty beer flavors. It has a little coffee and almost a little burnt sugar taste too it, but not enough to throw off the chocolate/stout combo -instead it adds a bit of depth. Perfection  Mouthfeel: Extremely smooth, rich, excellent  Overall: For it's style I can't think of any way this beer could be better so full marks. While not exactly inexpensive at $6.50 for 650ml it is worth every penny. If you love darker beers and/or chocolate you will love this beer. If you want a hoppy beer, look elsewhere -that isn't what this style or stouts in general are about. I'm going to have to add this to my list of favorite beers without a doubt.

132,1118,TheSixthRing,4.68,"Appearance - Pours a near pitch black, with only the brightest of lights piercing through the edges to reveal a deep, dark brown. Head is a light coca, 3 fingers deep, and retention for days. Resulting lace is thick and sticky.  Smell - Chocolate is the first thing to catch your nostrils, with notes of roasted malt, faint toffee and a bit of bitterness.  Taste - Darkly roasted malts entwined with a varying array of chocolate layers, from milk to bittering baker's, and it all comes together and ends up tasting a bit like a tootsie roll in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Medium in body, which is light for a stout, but the light carbonation lends to a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  Overall - By far the most complex, most satisfying chocolate stout I've ever had, and one of my all-time favorite beers. Everything about this beer is beautiful. If you're looking for sweet chocolate, then drink this one on the fairer side of warm; the bitterness is more predominant at colder temperatures.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Solid head retention that had a milk chocolate brown hue to it.  S: Unbeliveable rich dark chocolate comes to mind first, followed by a subtle smell of coffee, which doesn't overpower. A slight smell of hops lingers towards the end.  T: Taste was a bit disappointing, considering how great it smelled. First the rich dark chocolate hit my taste buds, then an earthy, ground coffee taste followed...would have liked to taste a bit more hops for the finish, but I know that is normally not true to the style (I'm a hop head at my core)  M: Felt very thick, almost like a mollasses or syrup...a bit too heavy for my taste, but still enjoyable. A moderate amount of carbonation, which suits the beer well.  O: Overall an enjoyable beer, one that I would drink again in the near future, especially on a cold and rainy day.

132,1118,BrownNut,4.32,"A - 4.0 - Totally opaque black. Decent tan head. Lots of lacing.  S - 4.5 - Straight up delicious. Creamy milk chocolate and maybe some kind of really sweet cookie-ish malt, with a tiny hint of something stiffer behind it.  T - 4.5 - More of that stiffer stuff from the aroma and in greater quantity. Not quite coffee but something approaching that. The barest rumor of fruit something. The immediate afterswallow is dark chocolate. After that comes a momentary wisp of mild char bitterness that's gone quickly. I'm surprised this is 69 IBU. After that are nice warm booze fumes wafting up from down low for a while. Longer term aftertaste is faint char bitterness and sweeter chocolate.  M - 4.0 - Feels initially weighty and silky as you pull it in yet gives way to lightness and a bit of carbonation tingle. Just a suggestion of astringency longer term, which is perfect.  O - 4.5 - I thought I was in for a sweet treat that would be more chocolaty than beery, a novelty, but this was distinctive, mature, and therefore memorable. Really well done. Two thumbs well up.

132,1118,Labeerfinder,4.3,"Pours pitch black with a large tan head and decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is chocolate, roast and cappucino. Taste is all about dark chocolate, bitter coffee and some sweet creaminess similar to a milk stout. Mouthfeel is full and drinkability is very good.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ToddT,4.35,"A- Dark black color with a thin tan head, the head fades quickly to a ring and leaves a few spots of lace on the glass.  S- Bittersweet chocolate, with hints of floral hops and notes of roasted malt.  T- Nice notes of chocolate right away, slightly bitter to start then mildly sweet. Floral hops and roasted malt balance things out in the middle and the finish is a final note of bittersweet chocolate with a hint of hop bitterness.  M- More than medium in body and low in carbonation, a creamy and silky smooth texture to this one.  O- Great chocolate taste, no notes of coffee present just chocolate goodness. An easy drinker and at 6.0% ABV one that you could have more than one of.  Notes: Review is for a cask conditioned gravity pour firkin.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Feels creamy and smooth, with a touch of bite on the tongue.  Very up front about the chocolate, and it delivers. Nice beer, I am planning a cake to be made from this stuff.

132,1118,Number45forever,3.92,"Excited for this one, Rogue is great and this beer comes highly recommended.  A gentle pour into my 2012 KATE THE GREAT SNIFTER gave a one finger dark hkaki head. Faded to a nice coating of tan bubbles on top of a black beer.  Smell is a hint of dark chocolate, some floral hops too. Very nice, a bit sharper than I expected. But nice.  Taste immediately hits you with VERY dark chocolate accentuated by a slight burst of hops. Fades into a creamy, milky chocolate. There is NO DOUBT that this is a chocolate stout. I'm currently drinking this one a bit too cold...  After letting this thing warm in the glass for 15 minutes, it's slightly creamier with a milkier chocolate finish. Goes down easy.  Moutfeel is slightly lighter than ideal. If this was thicker, I'd be in love. Still, for a 6% ABV beer this is what it is: easy to drink and quite choco-riffic.  This was a good beer.

Smell had roasted malt up front and chocolate more in the back. Taste was the reverse, rich on cocoa. There's a long bitter aftertaste more akin to unsweetened dark chocolate than bitters or roasted malt. All in all a quality chocolate product, and a decent beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Josh,4.41,"A - Dark, silky looking, two fingers of thick brown head. It takes several minutes for the head to subside, but a residual ""slick"" of head stays on the top. As you drink, head-like residue coats the side you are not sipping.  S - The smell came in waves for me. First I smelled bitter unsweetened chocolate, followed by a sweet smell that reminded me of thick drinking cocoa, and finished with a slight burn of alcohol.  T - Starts out slightly bitter, which is quickly overpowered by slightly sweet chocolate (not too sweet for a beer though), then slowly fades to a perfect bitter.  M - It starts out with slight carbonation, and goes down silky smooth like 2% milk.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Head leaves a little foam patch that is there the whole drink.  S- All sweet malts and chocolate on the nose. Deep malted grains with possibly a hint of a black licorice scent in there. This smells simply delicious.  T- Huge dark chocolate and malt flavors. Chocolate tones are all very dark and deep with little sweetness to them. Maybe slight hints of coffee intermingled with all the burnt malts. Slight tart bite on the end from the not-so-sweet chocolate. Gets better with every drink. Not terribly complex, but very delicious.  M- Relatively light and easy to drink. Somewhat high carbonation for a stout, but doesn't detract from the beer.  Overall, a very good chocolate stout. A little sweeter flavor would be preferable, but a very enjoyable brew. Great way to venture into Rogue's offerings.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BarryMFBurton,4.29,"With some brews, Rogue is overpriced. But a $7 bomber? That doesn’t seem too bad for a pretty big beer. I hope it has the quality of other $0.30/ounce beers I’ve had, at least. Let’s find out…  A: Deep, rich brown with a silky, oily chestnut head. The body is opaque, but looks light and a tad shiny. Possibly due to the fizzy nature of the retention, the bottom of the head looks darker than the top; it’s as if the head is a soft piece of bread, with a soggy darkening on half of it after it’s been dipped into soup. Lacing is here-and-there, webbed and chunky.  S: Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, and just the way I had hoped: no waxy, chalky cocoa powder, just rich brownie fudge, chocolate pie filling, and German milk chocolate (Kinder bars come to mind). Hazelnut, caramel, and toffee ooze from the malts, whose sweetness is only put off by a slight crisp aroma of oat. Smells a lot like a chocolate/hazelnut wafer (like Knoppers, overall, going back to German candy).  T: Familiar Rogue malts are right up front, showing their light spice and mouthfuls of grain. The chocolate is just like the nose: palpably sweet, but not chalky at all. It grounds the palate in earthiness, but not in a sugary, overwhelming way. The hops are like nothing I’ve ever had: they come off as lemon-rind bitterness and some cools bitter, like peppermint. Thank you Rogue Micro Hopyard for the new flavors! They work well in this palate. It finishes with more hazelnut and chocolate syrup, and even a smoky hint of mocha. Smooth flavors all around.  M: Mouth-coating, but not to an obnoxious extent. It still has that wateriness of a 6% brew, which does well to keep it drinkable. Very little fizz to be found.  O: This is one of the best uses of chocolate in a beer I’ve had, especially in the nose. Though light and smooth, this stout is as rich and filling as ever. $0.30/ounce? I’d say that’s the perfect price for beer like this.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,frogships,3.41,"Poured into a standard pilsner glass.  A: Pours a jet black with a hue on the bottom where light barely gets through of the darkest brown possible. there is a 2 finger foamy/bubbly head that goes down after about a minute or two but does retain a small half finger of bubbly head for a few more minutes. Minimal lacing, but some circulated throughout the glass.  S: Sweet chocolate, like sticking your nose in a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Rather pleasant.  T: Dark chocolate. Sweet but a tad bitter, like dark chocolate. It is a nice tasting stout that is dominant in the chocolate taste of course, but tastes like a stout nonetheless.  Mouthfeel: pretty full bodied with moderate carbonation. Very smooth like a stout should be but heavier than anything i would call medium bodied.  O: I am not overly impressed with the stout. It is a nice chocolate stout, a sweet smell and dark chocolate taste provides some complexity and uniqueness, but it lacks something that I can't quite put my finger on. I just didn't love it and I would consider it a tad overrated given the scores on this site, but I would recommend giving it a try for sure.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BeardedRiker,4.05,"I don't often drink Rogue beers. I'm...not really sure why. Maybe because they're just a tad more expensive than other beers and I've had most of what they've had to offer. However, I've not had their Chocolate Stout. All of Rogue's stouts are rated very highly. I found their Shakespeare Stout to be fantastic. It's Fat Tuesday so I will indulge myself in something chocolate. Now it's time to see how this beer fares.  This beer pours out the darkest of brown. Only when held up to the light can you make out the faintest of transparency and a slight ruby color. The head forms slowly and thick, about three fingers high. It's creamy and a light brown. Though it fizzes out pretty quickly, it does leave some good lacing.  This smells delicious. Rich chocolate, like smelling a bag of cocoa powder almost. It's definitely on the milk chocolate side, however, instead of a cocoa-rich dark chocolate smell. Oats and some coffee bitterness make themselves known as well. Sugary sweet chocolate. Honestly, this is just straight up chocolate. Chocolate bomb! The smell isn't complex...but damn does it smell awesome.  This is definitely a beer that tastes much better when let warm a bit. At first mostly what I got was cocoa and coffee bitterness, but now all of the flavors have showed up for the chocolate party. First to the tongue is the sugary sweetness and luxurious chocolate flavors. There's some noticeable hoppiness that adds some bitterness but it's not too strong. Following the milk chocolate goodness, although I wouldn't say this beer has a lactose taste to it, is cocoa and coffee that bring more of a full flavor and bitterness of their own. In the end roasted oats show up that lingers well with the cocoa and chocolate.  This is on the heavier side of medium-bodied...or on the lighter side of full-bodied with medium carbonation. Although I wish it had a bit more body, it's exceptionally smooth and creamy as well as drinkable. It's a bit dry overall but I'd say it's just a tad sticky from the sweetness.  If you like chocolate then this is an obvious choice for a beer to drink. It's so chocolatey that it's almost like drinking some milk chocolate, though without the lactose taste. This beer just screams, ""Delicious chocolate!"" I do prefer stouts to have more body and more complexity in smell and taste but in this case the Chocolate Stout excels so well in being a CHOCOLATE stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Pexkool,4.3,"Reviewed from notes, second time tasting it but first time reviewing.  A - Completely dark, as you cannot see any light through it. Pours a little dark brown head with no lace afterwards.  S - Delicious chocolate, like smelling a freshly unwrapped bar of fine chocolate. Sweet chocolate, raisins and dark fruits.  T - Coffee, toffee, dark chocolate (unlike the chocolate you can smell, it may be kind of surprising it tastes like dark chocolate), roasted malts and smoked flavors.  M - Carbonation is the first thing that comes to my mind, then the bitterness in the back of your mouth and tongue. Nonetheless, it also feels smooth.  Overall, an excellent stout with the kind of chocolate taste I like: Smooth and quite a complete body while not being too complex. I would have it again and again, but it's still not the top on my list.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A: Inky black body wearing a massive mocha-crown hat & superglue-sticky lacing.  S: Straight up coco - malted milk ball, y'all.  T: Ex-wife bitter coco explosion, good bit of roasted malt as well but the coco dominates, think of the bitterness of powdered hot coco.  M: Rogue brews all seem a little thin to me - this one is no exception, but the classic dry stout mouthfeel takes over quickly and pretty much makes up for it.  O: A damn good chocolate stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Arborescence,4.11,"Appearance: Pitch black, pours a massive, creamy head.  Aroma: Chocolate, unsurprisingly. Malt, light toasty notes. And some more chocolate!  Taste: Well, I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that I taste some chocolate… It’s a rather milky combination of chocolate and malt though, rather than the very dark, roasted chocolate flavour that you get with some Chocolate Stouts (I have Young’s Double Chocolate Stout in mind in particular). The beer supposedly packs a lot of hops as well, but I can’t really taste them, the chocolate and malt are overwhelming. Perhaps there is a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste, but that as well is dominated by notes of roasted malt.  Mouthfeel: Full and quite soupy.  Overall: This is my first sampling of the Chocolate Stout, and I was expecting not to be disappointed — I wasn’t! The beer is rated extremely highly, but there are some very valid competitors in this category...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,muskiesman,4.17,from my notes: 22 oz bottle poured into tulip glass Poured a dark coffee with a mocha head of two fingers that slowly fades to a heavy patchwork lacing through out the experience. Dark chocolate and roasted coffee on the nose followed by taste of expresso beans in dark chocolate surprisingly not very sweet but a dry cocoa and rich maltyness. Also present in the mouth very rich with out the unnecessary sugars. One of the best overall chocolate stouts.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Mouth-feel is full-bodied, smooth and creamy, with a slight dryness on the finish with some dark cocoa powder. Overall, I have wanted to try this for years, but never did. It's good, but I'm not big on the artificial chocolate flavors I'm picking up here.

Aggressive pour leads to a full 2-finger fluffy espresso colored head that fades to a ring in about 5 minutes. Lacing seems thick and plenty.  S: Lots of chocolate. Not as much sweet-chocolate as Choklat but a lot of nice, bitter, good dark chocolate and nice cocoa flavors shine through. Roasted malts are well represented here as well.  T: Chocolate backs down a bit as the roasted malts step up their game. Definitely can pick up the different malts used as I breathe back out after the swallow. Very nice tasting beer. Cocoa makes its presence known in dark bitter cocoa flavor as well as lending bitterness.  M: Very nice creamy feel. Big bodied American Stout. A touch overcarbonated for my liking but not terribly so.  O: This is a solid chocolate stout. This happens to also be my first offering from Rogue. I'm not sure why I've not tried anything from them until now but that's how it goes. At $4.99, this is a good buy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Siriusfisherman,4.03,"Appearance: Very dark, black with red tints coming through at the edges when held up to light. A thin brownish, creamy head that disappeared fairly quickly and left a thin ring with a few bubbles.  Smell: A very recognizable chocolate character, a kind of milk chocolate with a definite roast barley smell as well. The blend of malts and barley is very well balanced, but as to expect with a chocolate stout the chocolate is the main character.  Taste: The chocolate again is leading the pack, although in taste it is much more similar to a dark chocolate than in the smell. The roast barley adds some balance as well, probably leading the pack in the flavor from the grain bill. A hop bitterness is present as well, it does feel a little separate from the chocolate and this beer would probably benefit from some limited aging, helping to merge the two into a nice bitter chocolate character. A very well balanced chocolate ale though.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is a little bit in your face in this beer, I feel it could benefit being toned down a bit. It gives the beer a thin feel, which does not compliment a desert style chocolate stout. The oatmeal does add some lovely smoothness however, and after the beer warms and loses some carbonation in my snifter, it does open up a lot more.  Overall: This is a very good stout, the chocolate character is superb, and overall it is quite balanced. I will say however that the mouthfeel does not compliment the chocolate as well as it could. Perhaps a beer like this would benefit more by having a thicker body, maybe even getting the Imperial Stout upgrade. That is getting picky though, I could drink a bomber of this no problem, and would surely be sad when I see the bottom.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

It does have a chocolate truffle finish with a bit of hops bitterness.  Mouthfeel: medium to thick. Powerful carbonation.

132,1118,FeDUBBELFIST,2.16,"Bomber to pint glass. Sampled 8/26/11 - This bottle is about two years old at the time of this review.  A: Pours with a huge 5 finger head, foamy and bubbling, medium brown in color and very long lasting. The body is as dark as brown gets.  S: Chocolate, caramel and cookie. The nose is decent, but beyond the cocoa aromas, there is little left to be enjoyed.  T: Rather one dimensional - and offering nothing more than the simple nose.  M: The mouthfeel doesn't give the flavor a chance to shine. Very light and incredibly thin. Carbonation is lively and fizzy, but with the insubstantial body, it works as a detriment, lacking the fullness that is expected in a stout.

T: Chocolate, toasted oats, more chocolate, and vanilla with a hint of hazelnut. This beer is not nearly as sweet as I anticipated, which made it all the more appealing. This brew really hides it alcohol well, and is probably the best-balanced stout I've ever tasted.  M: Medium-full bodied with the creaminess that is characteristic of the style. This stout is much more pleasing on the palate than many of the other stouts I've recently had, being it's not over-carbonated and maintains it's depth.  O: This beer feels good and goes down smooth.

After just having two Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stouts and an entire Stone Double Bastard bomber, I don't know how well the palate is holding up tonight. Let's give this badboy a shot.  A: Black. Black as midnight. Hold it up to the light, still BLACK. Put a flashlight under it, BLACK! I like it! HUGE five finger ebony brown head with respectable retention that stays throughout the whole session, and an amazing sticky lacing spiraling down the glass.  S: Has an indisputable chocolate coffee scent. Sweet caramelized sugar. Not too weak or too strong either. Very slight hint of booze, hops and bittersweet cocoa.  T: Chocolate, dark roasted coffee, roasted malts, some subtly bitter cooking chocolate and hops laced throughout, earthy with a light hint of floral citrus, oats and buttered bread. Finishes sweet with that chocolate coffee goodness and leaves a perfectly subtle bitter hops and cooking cocoa aftertaste. Not too sweet, not too bitter, nice bold flavor and amazing balance. Couldn't ask for better!  M: Nice and full, moderate (perfect) carbonation tickles the tongue, slightly sticky and chewy, sticks to the tongue and walls of the mouth, never dry despite the bitter bite in the finish.  O: This leaves me speechless. It's perfect. It's almost like a dessert. I've been reviewing top beers according to reviews here, and buying what's available at the local stores around my area. I saw this one on the shelf and I'm glad I picked it up.  This stood up against tastings of Stone's Double Bastard and Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout today, and came out the best of these three titans of great beer today. A new favorite. I hope to experience many more times to come. I will buy this again and again. This will be nigh impossible to beat according to this palate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The finish is a very light chocolate, with a lingering bitterness.  M: Light, thin, highly carbonated...too carbonated.  O: Fairly unimpressive.

Taste- The taste is the same as the smell with this beer, except it comes through very quickly, as if a massively complex array of malty chocolate flavors are packed into a microsecond, after which those flavors quickly give way to a bitterness that remains.  Overall- This beer smells like... heaven... I mean the delicate balance of malt, sugar and creamy chocolate is incredible. However, the taste of the beer is comparatively average in my opinion. All that wonderful flavor is overwhelmed with a bit too much bite for my taste. The Hazelnut Brown Nectar is the exact opposite, not as rich or full of a smell, but a much smoother finish. Id recommend that over the chocolate stout any day.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A: Pours stout dark and opaque, with a big fluffy tan head with tight bubbles and decent lace.  S: Tons of chocolate, some sweeter dark malts, and a touch of vanilla and caramel.  T: Genuine, not artificial, silky milk chocolate from start to finish. A touch of roast bitterness that lets you know its still beer, and maybe a touch of lactose/lactose sugar.

Really respectable. Not as candy toothed as I thought it would be. I sometimes shy away from flavored beers because I feel like I'm drinking a mediocre beer with some additives to mask it. This is a great stout, with chocolate in it.  M: Smooth and creamy, just the way a chocolate stout should be. Somewhat redolent of chocolate milk. A little sparkle of carbonation in there too, but not distracting from the silked out smoothness.  O: Very satisfying and steadying.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TheAlamoWrocker,3.29,"Reviewed January 1, 2012. Poured a 650 mL bottle into a mug.  A: This poured quite an interesting head, the head was thickly carbonated with over 4 fingers in size. This poured black, but it seemed almost like a black molasses color. Laces quite amazingly.  S: This has a strong chocolate malt smell. The head that stays strong is odd in the smell that it adds because its almost bubbly (to an extent soapy). The chocolate malt oddly comes in strongest during the swallow of the drink.  T: This carries an odd taste in that it's not really sweet. This was a drink that I've heard praise about its chocolatey goodness, but it's not at all what I was hoping for. This carries like a powdery chocolatey taste, extremely malty almost like a fountain malt shake.  M: This hits the tongue heavily carbonated (almost like a soda), but then it transforms into a full bodied thick drink. This definitely carries a nice creamy thickness.  O: I'm not quite sure that this is rated as high as it is. This as a decent taste and all, but it doesn't really feel like a beer. The taste are simply to simple in this.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,BeerMeInMS,4.68,"Drinking Date: 12/31/11  Glassware: Pint  Appearance: Pitch black with foamy, bubbly brown head that leaves thick lacing behind as sip through the brew.  Smell: At first sniff a zesty, floral/citrusy hop smell was the heart of the aroma. However, as the head got thinner, Milk chocolaty notes asserted themselves for a mild, but pleasing smell.  Taste: A sharp cocoa flavor was foremost that was immediately accompanied with a roasted character; hops shone through and provided a zesty but balanced bitterness; then sweet chocolate comes in that reminded me of desert; These flavors play around in every sip; As it comes up to room temperature, the sweetness and roasted notes become more pronounced; finishes surpisingly clean with some bitterness, which allows the next sip to be met with a fairly clean palate. Wonderful...  Mouthfeel: Velvety smooth and rich; crisp and clean on the end.  Overall: The taste is perfect...It's got variety, depth, and complexity all wrapped in deliciousness.

The taste is also dominated by chocolate. There is a slight roastiness detectable but it is upstaged by the cocoa. A moderate bitterness comes in at the end.

132,1118,phenomenologian,4.57,"I opened this and poured into an oversized wineglass. not the correct glass I know.  Upon pouring a little smoke comes out. It pours with a one to two finger head that laces and settles. The body color is blackish brown but very very dark and opaque. The color of the head is a creamy light brownish.  It smells of chocolate, some hops, and some grain. The chocolate smell is not too dominating or robust that all you smell is chocolate. You can smell hops and grain too. However, the other two smells are faint in the disguise of chocolate. Not like drinking chocolate syrup or milk by any means. It still tastes of beer.  It tastes of chocolate and grain, and a bit of hops. The beginning taste is of chocolaty hops and grain, but the aftertaste is a nice overtone of milk chocolate in a sort of sweet/bitter way. I really enjoy this chocolaty taste in this beer.  The mouthfeel is a smooth feeling but its sticky at the same time. It is still very drinkable.  Overall this is a great beer. Its pricey but worth the money. The chocolate tones in this beer make it a great buy. I highly recommend it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

T: A roasty acidy chocolate upfront with a blended vanilla coffee blended in. A watery mild hop on the back. Good.  M: Medium body with a huge carbonation. A watery bitter finish. Decent.  O: All in all, this is a good beer. Definitely not as good as Choklat, but still a good chocolate stout.

T: Rich and chocolaty, with a little bit of cream. There is a slight hint of mint actually, that was increased when I took a sip after eating a few chocolate chips. Finish is slightly bitter.  M: A little thin, but not really a problem for me. Nice creamy texture, on the lower end in terms of carbonation.  O: Not the first time I have had this beer, and hopefully not the last.

There is an obvious chcolate flavor but the roasted and coffee flavors are much more powerful than they are in the smell. M-Starts slightly sweet, finishes dry. Overall, a very good stout. I expected the chocolate to overpower the beer but it's actually very balanced and really just adds to the stout flavor profile.

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied stout. Slight prickly feeling on the roof of my mouth from the carbonation.  Overall - An excellent chocolate stout from Rogue.

Smell is similarly appealing with roasted grains and ample notes of bitter dark chocolate. No booze is evident in the smell, which is quite nice.  Taste is great. Actually tastes like bitter, dark chocolate with just enough residual sweetness balanced by bitterness. The roasted malts produce plenty of chocolate flavor, without booze or overly roasted overtones - especially as it begins to warm. Very good.  Mouthfeel is typical for the style. Smooth, with a tough of both water and thick syrup (as oxymoronic as that sounds).  Definitely worth seeking out. One of the better Chocolate Stouts available.

132,1118,BilbosNuts,4.42,"Poured from a 650mL bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a dark as night, very opaque, dark black. A one finger, mocha colored head sits atop the black mass. It has decent retention, but faded into a thin film across the top. It's pretty sticky, leaving some scattered lacing on the glass as you drink.  S: Up front there is a roasted malt and dark bitter chocolate backbone. As it warms, the nose builds, releasing sweet chocolate syrup, earthy, and nutty aromas.  T: Chocolate is again the main player here comprised of dark bitter and a light spicy chocolate taste. The chocolate is delicately implemented, allowing the roasted malts to also make a nice complementary appearance. A sweet chocolate syrup taste lingers on the palate, persuading you to have another taste.  M: This has a medium to thick body that is on the heavier side. There isn't much carbonation and is relatively still. A light coat is left on the palate until you take your next taste.  O: Once again, Rogue does not disappoint. This is certainly one of the better stouts I have had. The chocolate is perfectly placed. It is noticeable, but not overpowering. I highly recommend this one and will be picking it up myself occasionally, as it is always available.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Awesome. The color of the beer itself is very dark, almost black. Retention is excellent and the lacing is thick and lasting.  S: Chocolate and roasted malts prevail. Very inviting.  T: Immediate dark chocolate flavor. Sweet chocolate syrup orchestrates initially, but crosses over to a more alcohol-flavored finish. It wasn't as ""chocolatey"" as I expected it to be, which turned out to be a positive note.  M: Almost perfect. Medium carbonation that drives the flavor around and ends crisp and dry. Very good.

S: Dark cocoa and chocolate syrup. Slightly sweet.  T: Dark chocolate and chocolate malts into a heavy cocoa bitterness, which lingers long after a sip. Roastiness of the malts becomes more pronounced as it warms, and a hint of cereal grain aftertaste arrives late. Sweetness is noticeable but not pronounced.  M: Medium bodied and slightly chalky, kind of like chocolate milk. A little dry.  O: Only the second chocolate beer I've ever tried.

The taste is along the same lines as the smell, but much more bitter than I expected (which isn't a bad thing). This reminds me of a higher cocoa percentage chocolate bar. Mouthfeel is a bit disappointing as it is pretty thin. The carbonation is a little too high for the style, but isn't off-putting. Overall, very nice stout. This isn't as much of a dessert beer as you'd might expect. There is not a lot of sweetness here and the body is also lighter than you would expect.I would have liked to have seen a little more sweetness to help balance out the bitterness.

132,1118,weizenbob,2.02,"This bomber was purchased at Jimmie Garant's in Alpena, MI for $6.99. No bottling/best by date could be located. My first impression of Chocolate Stout comes via the woman on the label seemingly enjoying a frothy mug of (presumably) Chocolate Stout. The snob in me casts shame on this mystery figure's choice of glassware. I joke. Later I discovered the woman is Sebbie Buhler, a Rogue employee who writes a blog devoted to all things Chocolate Stout (http://roguechocolatestout.com).  I cracked the cap and poured into a tulip glass, because, as previously established, I'm too much of a snob to use a mug. The pour yields three fingers of billowy, khaki-colored head. Retention is really good. Lacing replaces the head as it slowly dissipates. The beer is as black as any I've seen. It is a thing of beauty.  Unfortunately, the nose is not as gorgeous as the visual aesthetic. The first whiff reveals the strange scent of Elmer's glue. A closer inspection unveils a literal milk chocolate aroma. The label claims that this is made with imported chocolate. That's all I smell: glue and chocolate. It is simple and weird. Me no likey.  Thankfully the flavor bears little resemblance to the aroma. Unfortunately, however, it is equally, if not more unappealing. Initially it tastes like heartburn. A strange bitterness persists that does not resemble hops, or any other bitterness I've encountered in beer. Behind the unusual bitterness is a wet cardboard flavor. Roasted malts arise and then duck behind the flavor of vomit. I'm not kidding. As much as I want to enjoy this, it is just about the most atrocious beer that has touched my lips. Chocolate manifests subtly at the end of the sip, but it is totally limp and powerless against the train wreck of flavor that preceded it. Gross.  The mouthfeel is kind of creamy but still feels pretty thin for a stout, yet alone a stout that claims to contain ""natural chocolate flavoring"". It's straddling the line between light and medium bodied. The carbonation level is appropriate. Though unimpressive, the feel is far from the most disappointing aspect of this brew.  What should I make of this mess? It's not good beer; it's not good chocolate, and it's not a good value. I guess it is possible that I bought an old bottle, but with no bottle dating on Rogue products, how would I know? Thus far, every Rogue Ale I have sampled has been a disappointment. Somebody please turn me onto something worth drinking from this brewery before I write them off completely. Now I'm off to wash out my mouth with a big-ass can of Evil Eye. I guess I should have used a mug.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (reference my profile for an explanation) For what I spent on this bomber (emphasis on ""bomb"") I could have grabbed a 6-pack of satisfying Schlitz Tallboys and a chocolate bar.

I can't see much carbonation due the darkness of the beer and there is some good lacing on the sides of the glass. The head lasted for 5 minutes before it was gone.  Smell - Chocolate, malts, smoke, roasted nuts  Taste & Mouth - The beer has a high amount of carbonation and it feels very lively on the tongue - yet still creamy. I can taste chocolate mixed with malts and a roasted/smoke taste. It ends with a chocolatey aftertaste with a lingering bitter aftertaste.  Overall – One of the better chocolate beers I've had so far. The burnt/bitter aftertaste adds a nice dynamic to the beer. Worth seeking out in my opinion.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,cdkrenz,3.9,A - Black body with a dark brown head starting at an inch and fading very slowly.  S - A very unique aroma of slightly spicy chocolate. This aroma begs to be consumed.  T - Dark robust long roasted malts creating a deep cocoa flavor and rather sharp burnt taste.  M - The feel is rather soft and light on the lips while gaining weight as it travels toward the back of my mouth.  ~ This is a solid beer in all categories... except the drinkability. I think this is a beer that needs the right place and the right time to really be enjoyed. I would definitely recommend it to a friend and would try it again but I think this is one that should be sipped slowly while sitting alone quietly in front of a fireplace on a cold winter night. It's too sharp for breakfast and not sweet enough for dessert.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,shand,3.48,"Poured from a bomber into a mug.  This brew looks good, it's a nice deep brown color with a large head. The smell is that of just an everyday stout. And the taste is that too. I mean, it's really just straight up Guinness Extra Stout-esque, in both taste and (thin) body. It's not bad, but get Guinness Extra Stout and save four bucks.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kmatlack,3.16,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a stemless wine glass. No bottle date from what i can tell.  A- Pours a dark brown/black color with a creamy looking light mocha colored head. Dies down into a small film on top of the surface.  S- Lots of chocolate and coffee up front, a little bit of roasty malts, more chocolate. Smells to be a little oxidized maybe? Some very subtle hints of cardboard that is reminicent of vomit. Weird. Doesnt take away from the chocolate onslaught that this beer provides.  T- Follows the nose, coffee and chocolate, a little sweet, alot of bitter. Relatively high IBU, not the norm but interesting nonetheless. The intense chocolate is the only reason that this beer gets a slightly above average rating in this catergory. Lingering bitterness.  M- Average mouthfeel on this one, creamy, not bad. Get a little bit of metallic taste that bounces off the roof of my mouth. Kindof strange.  O- Only slightly above average. Good for the style. I like Rogue alot, maybe this one isnt as fresh as id like but i can only rate this on what i have in front of me, it is what it is.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,enzocc,5,"A - Dark brown, black color. Creamy, sticky head, with a beige color. More beautiful than that it cant be posible.  S - Chocolate, dark chocolate, coffee, and gianduia aromas all over. The main character of smell on this beer is the cacao, the chocolate. Beautiful introduction to the beer that makes you watery your mouth.  T - Gianduia icecream. Dark chocolate flavors. Very low in hops flavors. A lot of sweetness, but you can catch a bitter touch somewhere. THE TASTE is only chocolate, it can be more perfect.  M - Creamy, smooth, a little bit sticky creating a dessert style beer. The smoothness on this beer is perfect. You can ask for more.  Chocolate Stout by Rogue. A beer that i didn't think that would be like this. A perfect chocolaty, sweet and bitter. A beer that takes you from all the chocolates that have you taste to any chocolate beer that have you try. This beer is the BEST CHOCOLATE BEER on the market.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Oldscramch,4.2,"Appearance: Black as black can be with deep ruby accents on the bottom. Medium khaki head which recedes fairly quickly to cover the entire top of the beer.  Smell: Glorious! Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate! Malty, too, but not as out in front as the chocolate.  Taste: Malty and then chocolatey, in reverse of the smell.  Mouthfeel: Weak for the style and taste, but not disappointing.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,carolinabeerguy,4.3,"Review from notes at World of Beer - Fort Myers on 9/30/11.  Poured on draft into a shaker pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a coffee black with a 1 finger light tan head. Excellent lacing.  Smell: Sweet milk chocolate with a touch of roasted malt.  Taste: Semisweet chocolate up front followed by roasted malt in the middle before ending with burnt toast and a nice hoppy bitterness. Toasted aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Very smooth and creamy.  Drinkability: Good drinkability. The elevated ABV% would keep you from drinking multiples, but it's still very good.  Overall: Excellent beer overall. I think the draft is almost as good as the bottled version, which is saying something. Definitely worth trying.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,evlu1441,4.1,"This is the second time I've had this beer. The first time I remember it being really chocolaty, and considering it's made with ""natural chocolate flavouring,"" that's hardly a surprise. Here's my review:  It pours almost pitch black and completely opaque with the slightest red tinge around the edges. The head is a chocolate-milk colour. A tasty looking treat!  The aroma is sweet and malty with a rich toasted aroma topped with some chocolate chips. Reminds me of breakfast cereal in a way.  The taste is sweet, and lightly toasty up front. Controlled chocolatey notes towards the middle. Some slight hop bitterness comes through towards the end alongside some slight burnt chocolate flavours. Drinkability is very high on this delicious treat.  Overall, this is a really tasty beer and good on almost any occasion!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RandyV,3.87,"This is a stellar chocolate stout, to me what this style should be. The smell of chocolate and roasted malt comes through in the flavor. The chocolate flavor is nice, a hybrid of dark, milk and malt chocolate. The mouthfeel is OK, maybe slightly watery. It finishes slightly espresso bitter, which is a nice balance to the malt chocolate sweetness.  This is a good, tasty beer and one that I wouldn't mind having again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kevanb,4.21,"From Notes, Bomber into a pint glass.  This beer pours a nice thick deep brown color, bordering on jet back but has hints of caramel colors. It has a nice 1 finger coffee colored head that lingers long after the pour. It tastes like a brownie in a glass, dark bitter chocolate with a touch of hazelnut complimented by sweet malts and a bit of coffee. It has an almost milk like texture that compliments the flavors so well, goes down smoothly with no trace of alcohol.  Verdict: Really fantastic chocolate stout, we put vanilla and raspberry ice cream in it to make a beer float which made it even more interesting. Great desert beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ColForbinBC,4.03,"22oz bomber poured into a tulip  Pours a near ink black with an extremely thick dark brown cap. Great retention with loads of lace. The aroma is of semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. This is pretty straightforward. The flavor profile mimics the nose. Semi-sweet bakers chocolate up front before a pleasant roast and coffee flavor take over. The finish is more of a cocoa powder, granular type of feel. A bit syrupy, full bodied. Smooth, with just that bit of granulation in the finish. Overall, this is a solid stout. It definitely hits its mark.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mtschmitz,4.42,"A) Heavy and dark poured into a pint glass, one finger head with staying power  S) Rich roasted malt aroma with dark chocolate which is very evident. macadamia nut, and cocoa  T) Dark dark chocolate upfront which combines extremely well with the roasted malt Well-balanced with a slight taste of hops.  M) Smooth with a nice sweetness that hangs on the palate. The bitter chocolate taste develops quite well.  O) A very good stout with chocolate profiles that don't overwhelm the overall character of the beer. Will definitely be picking this one up again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,oline73,4.02,"Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass.  Appearance: Pours black with a layer of tan head that goes away completely.  Smell: Reminds me of Hershey's syrup. A bit creamy and sweet with some mild roast.  Taste: Just like the smell. Super strong chocolate flavor. A bit roasty and creamy. The finish has a bitterness to it, but the chocolate flavor remains.  Mouthfeel: The body is on the thicker side and very smooth. Tingly, mild carbonation with a dry finish.  Overall: I've always wanted to try this one and I'm glad I did. Not as intense as Choklat. This beer is exactly what is says it is. I'd have another.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,JayQue,4.57,"Wow!! I wasn't expecting a Chocolate Stout to be this good. The big aroma got out before the cap was even off the bottle....Milk chocolate, slightly cut in sweetness by roasted malts.  Pours a dense dark brown color into a pint glass. No light getting through this one. Dark tan head, big with good retention. Plenty of lacing. The aroma holds up outside the bottle as well. Strong, enticing milk chocolate aroma and some roasted malt.  Taste is key here, too much chocolate or too much sweetness would affect the taste and drinkability of the beer. Not a problem, the roasted malt and milk chocolate are expertly blended so that the chocolate can be the main flavor, but not too sweet.  Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. Overall a great stout. I could drink a bunch of this. I am really enjoying my trip through the top hundred beers of fame.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,pBRale,4.48,"From tasting notes 9-16-11  Appearance: Dark brown pour with a dark brown head--very creamy looking and a fine stream of bubbles rises up, replenishing the head. Has average to moderate retention.  Smell: Nice dark chocolate smell along with a bit of coffee as well. Also some roasted malts. As it warms, a sweet candied sugar smell emerges along with a hint of alcohol.  Taste: Roasted chocolate and coffee, along with an earthy hop taste in the mix. The beer has a nice chocolatey finish and lingering coffee aftertaste. Tastes like a variety of chocolates in the beer (dark, milk, semi-sweet, etc.) that is a nice blend.  Mouthfeel: Medium to thick body, medium carbonation, and a smooth finish. A very drinkable beer.  Overall: A superior stout that is brimming with bold flavor. An outstanding beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DavidST,3.5,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter.  This pours a pitch black color with a decent mocha colored head, but with large bubbles which quickly dissipate down to a thin layer, its a good looking beer but I prefer the look of the stouts with a nice frofty bubbled head (the one with the dense thin bubbles). The smell was pretty good, chocolate with roasted malts. The feel was good medium to thick, although it was also a little grimy and gritty. The taste left something to be desired though. The main taste was an artificial gritty/dirty/grimy chocolate flavor maybe like a Hersey chocolate syrup (the stuff you pour into milk), it was a little too sweet and I didn't get the normal roasted malt bitterness, just this grimy sweetness (gone are the great dark chocolate flavors). You could probably take a Guinness draft and load Hershey's Chocolate syrup into it and get basically the same poor taste. Overall this was decent, but I'd take a Brooklyn Chocolate Stout over this one every time (and they cost less). I definitely don't understand why this is rated so high.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,zeledonia,4.33,"No date on the bottle, but I know it's at least 7 months old (cause sadly, that's when I bought it). Too many beers, too little time.  Pours black, no light even at the edges. Big two-finger medium-tan head, fluffy and dense like a sponge. The head sticks around, gradually puckering and relaxing to a thick layer on the surface. Gobs of lacing stick to the side. This is a darn good looking beer.  Smell is a lovely mix of chocolate syrup and dark chocolate malts. Yum. The blend is fantastic; the chocolate on both sides is slightly bitter but rich, and there's a light hit of hops in the background. Smells more like chocolate than stout, but with how good it is, that's fine with me.  Taste is a little more stout, a little less chocolate. It comes across more like dark high-cocoa chocolate, with less sweetness and milky smoothness than the smell. Hops bring a bit of bitter and a bit of sharpness. Also has an odd starchy flavor that I can't place. Finish is long, mostly choco-bitter.  Mouthfeel is the main thing that betrays that it's not an impy stout. It's not thin, but it's only medium-bodied. Smooth, carbonation is ample but subdued. Spot-on.  This beer punches well above its weight. It drinks like a much bigger stout than its 6% ABV - super flavorful, potent, and rich. I'm impressed.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jhammel01,4.57,"Pours a deep pitch black with a hearty milk chocolate colored head. Lots of retention. Healthy does of lacing all the way down..  Smells like expensive dark chocolates. Bitter cocoa also here along with a bit of hops and malts.  Great milky mouthfeel. Not as much chocolate flavor as expected. When you smell it, you expect a chocolate bomb but it's definitely not. Lots of roasted malt character, Bitter hops up front and a little bit of chocolate in the finish. A bit grainy. Such a great contrast between hops and chocolate.  Overall, another favorite stout! Perfect for an unexpectedly cool fall evening.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Knapp85,3.9,"This beer poured out as a pretty nice looking dark brown color. The head was mocha colored and left a little bit of lacing on the glass. The smell of this beer was actually pretty nice, It gave off a pleasant sweet milk chocolate aroma with a touch of roasted malts in there too. The flavor was pretty good, I enjoyed the slight bitterness it had in the back end after all the sweetness faded. The mouthfeel like most Rogue ales to me seemed a little on the thin side. Overall it's not a terrible brew but could have used a little more body I think.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DrainBamage,3.95,Pours black with a nice brown half-inch head. Smells of roasted malts with hints of chocolate. For taste you are first deliver with nice and smooth chocolate flavor going down smooth and then a smack of bitterness.  This beer is way more bitter than I remember. It's still a good beer which I will probably get again sometime.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Snorlax,4.63,"Reviewed from notes taken this August in New Orleans- picked up a bottle from Whole Foods as I'm always down to try a Rogue offering I can't get at home. Cracked the bottle open, welcomed the ghost smoke with eager nostrils.  A: Pours like a luscious syrup. Has a sheen to it from all the oily chocolate goodness. A beer that truly builds anticipation as the head slowly rises. Head is sticky and thick.  S: Oh man, in a word, great. Real rich chocolate smell, not like the obvious extracts used in many chocolate flavored brews.  T: I will not give many 5's as I understand a 5 literally means flawless, 0% chance of improving, etc. but this is the most perfect tasting chocolate stout I've ever had. The fact that it's made with real chocolate is blatantly apparent. So rich, so smooth. And that after taste: pure truffles. Absolutely amazing.  M: Almost a syrup. Oily with chocolate alkaloids. A true joy to drink.  This is quite simply the best use of chocolate I have ever experienced in a beer. Will buy anytime I see it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,rtaps,4.03,"Poured very dark almost black, with a 1/2 inch tan head. With medium retention  All I could smell was the chocolate  Taste like a very dark but rich chocolate bar. Felt very smooth with little carbonation  Overall give this beer an A- would recommend trying it",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,cmq103,4.15,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a Duvel Belgian Tulip glass.  Appearance: A semi-aggressive pour resulted in a nice, frothy 1/2"" tan head that reduced to thin ring. Impressive clingy lacing as the glass is tilted. This is one dark and murky beer.  Smell: Wonderful bittersweet chocolate aroma, mixed with freshly brewed black coffee and malts. I also sense some oats in the finish.  Taste: Wow, this has a noticeably bitter unsweetened chocolate first impression. It definitely smells sweeter than it tastes. I catch a hint of coffee, molasses and vanilla too.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and moderate body with decent carbonation. Dry bitterness shines from beginning to end.  Overall: An outstanding American Stout with tons of flavor. Very drinkable at a modest 6% ABV. I could easily have a few of these in one sitting. This clearly sets the benchmark for an American Stout. My favorite style is the RIS, which tends to be too heavy to enjoy more than one. This is kind of like RIS baby brother. Well done Rogue!!!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Flightoficarus,4.25,"A - Pours a rich, very dark brown, with a moderate sepia head and lacing.  S - Smell is of chocolate syrup, roasted espresso, caramel, and brownies. It's basically desert in a glass on the nose!  T - Taste is of bready malts with bakers chocolate/chocolate syrup, caramel, and honey notes, blended splendidly with just enough roasted coffee bitterness to keep things well balanced.  M - Mouthfeel is on the higher side of medium. Carbonation is mild, and the beer is slick and smooth. Maybe just slightly thinner than average for the style, but if anything, it works to the beer's advantage here.  O - Overall, this is one delicious stout, and one I can definitely see myself coming back to during the upcoming fall and winter months. Well done Rogue!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,chinchill,4.17,"undated 650ml bottle shared with 2 friends. Served in large wine glass.  Plenty of chocolate flavor in this one, although a little more in the milk (vs. dark) chocolate vein and not quite as chocolately as my gold standard: Youngs Double Chocolate Stout. There's a fine rich, chocolate finish that is about as good as it gets, with a nice bit of dark roasted malt flavor, a faint hint of coffee, and a touch of spicy hops. The beer is mildly hoppy throughout at a level that is well matched to the malt and chocolate. The last statement applies to both the aroma and the flavor.  O - excellent. A must try for any chocolate lover. Lacking the splendid head but nonetheless on par with my gold standard: Youngs Double Chocolate Stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,uawildcat,3.75,A: Looks like a deep dark stout with a nice large head that retains.  S: Smells very chocolatey and sweet. Almost like a milk chocolate.  T: Tastes like a good chocolate stout. Though it was a tad too dark chocolate flavor for me upfront. Gradually sweetens in the aftertaste. Seems to be overly hopped for the style in my opinion.  M: Has the appropriate thickness but seems to be acid or something leading to a prickly feel in the mouth.  O: A pretty good chocolate stout. Only available in 22 oz bottles makes impractical as an everyday stout.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Jimmys,4.15,"A: jet black body. opaque. frothy light brown head is pretty to look at and follows up with some good retention. good lacing as well.  S: aroma is blatantly chocolate milk. i cant even sense anything else. very unique and very inviting.  T: a bustling lactose riddled with smooth sweet chocolate. a touch of roast works its way into the finish turning it slightly dry.  M: creamy and medium/full bodied. just perfect for the style.  D: sort of one-note with all the chocolate, but it is still a very tasty, unique brew. not complaining about the note it's singing at all. after having their hazelnut and chocolate, im looking forward to just about anything else from rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Digimaika2,4.02,"A: Pours pitch black with a substantial mocha coloured foam head that leans more towards bubbly than creamy. Good retention and good lacing.  S: Rich dark chocolate, dark coffee, vanilla, anise, nutmeg, and some very faint hops. Reminds me of a very rich chocolate cake dessert, in other words, it smells delicious.  T: Fairly similar to smell with lots of dark chocolate upfront, and a little bit of roasted dark coffee, with a more pronounced hop-forward presence in the taste. From the initial smell was expecting a bit more in the taste department, but nonetheless still really quite good. Finishes pleasingly dry, with a slight lingering bitterness.  M: Quite a thin mouthfeel (even for the ABV) with a healthy dose of carbonation which I'm feeling is a bit strong for this.  D: Very nice stout that I would likely have again. However, my expectations were perhaps a little too high for this, as I was expecting a bit more complexity. Still a pleasing Rogue offering that I will likely be revisiting in the future.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Gatch,3.86,"A - As dark brown as a beer can get. Deep brown head. Quickly fades with good lacing on the glass.  S - Roasted malt, some cocoa, and more malt.  T - Tons of roasted malt. Some dark chocolate. Charred and smoked meat.  M - Smooth, slight carbonation, slight alcohol. Roasted character from the first sip to the last. Lingers heavily on the palate. A solid, full-bodied stout.  Not as much chocolate as the name suggests. Just a lot of roasted malt. I held off on reviewing this beer because I had it out of a 22oz. bomber a few years ago and have had it on draft a few times since and have been disappointed. I still find myself disappointed. When this is straight from the tap, it's cold and doesn't have much flavor. When I let it warm up...it just became a typical stout. Nothing special.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,StraightNoChaser,3,"Appearance: it looks a stout though a non-descript one. Smell: chocolate (duh). Not bad but nothing like I was expecting. Taste: again, chocolate and enjoyable but nothing outstanding IMO. Based on rep I thought this one would drink like a chocolate shake so to speak. Full disclosure, after kbs and to a lessor degree southern tiers chokolat, maybe I'm ruined. Still with less alcohol I anticipated a quaffer. A tasty stout but no standout IMO.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,iheartIPA,3.93,"Aggressive pour of this black beauty yields a healthy light- brown 3 finger head.  Respectable lacing with every sip.  First thing to come to mind as I stick my nose in the duvel glass is Hershey's Syrup. In fact the more I inhale, the more I realize that, had I been blindfolded, I would not know if this were Rogue's Chocolate Stout or an ice-cold glass of chocolate milk.   This brew is not as thick as anticipated (assumed).  In fact, it's a little on the thin side. Not a lot of action on the tongue.  Silky and fairly flat.   That's not to say this stout is disappointment. While the mouthfeel isn't terribly impressive, the overall taste certainly is.  Essentially it's bold roasted malts and straight up dark chocolate goodness.  Not super complicated, just super tasty. Dessert in a glass.  I will surely buy another.

132,1118,rhenning,4.5,"Bomber bottle, poured into Tripel Karmeleit chalice.  Opaque, very dark brown, nearly black, with several fingers of fluffy deep tan / light brown head.  Nose overwhelmingly chocolate and cocoa with a bit of a mineral quality (rich chocolate ovaltine, anyone?) and a bit of vanilla.  Mouthfeel is luxuriously soft and fluffy.  Tastes strongly of milk chocolate, with hints of milk caramels and a bit of a carbon/charred finish.  Overall, a wonderful chocolate dessert stout, very drinkable for such a rich beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ferrari29,4.08,Beer poured from bottle into a Pint shaped glass  My 250th review!  A - Beer poured with a one finger brown rocky colored foam; held very well; plenty of healthy sticky lacing; solid dark brown/black colored body; no visible carbonation  S - Deep dark chocolate notes; fantastic roasted malt scents; overwhelming large amount of dark malt aromas; slight cork and chalky scents; light scent of oats and grains  T - Chocolate milk with a kick of caramel and alcohol flavors; some cork and oak taste; espresso and coffee deep aftertaste; intense flavor  M - Full body feel; nice and bubbly; slight bitter taste and chocolate lingering aftertaste; filling and coating on the tongue; espresso mucus taste  D - Good dessert drink; nice blend of chocolate and coffee flavors,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jondeelee,4.2,"Smells just like a cup of hot cocoa. Seriously. If you put this in a cup and had someone do a blindfolded smelling session, they'd identify this as hot cocoa. With maybe just a touch of chocolate liqueur thrown in.  On the tongue, the chocolate taste is *very* apparent--more so than perhaps any other chocolate stout I've tried. In fact, the brew tastes, in many ways, like sucking on a Tootsie Pop while sipping on, say, Godiva's chocolate liqueur. Which is not to say that it's bad in any way; in fact, it's quite good. And I don't normally like chocolate stouts. There are, of course, other flavors in the beer as well: some nice chocolate malts that give a lovely almost-burnt-grain taste; some deep caramels; and just at the edge, perhaps a hint of dark fruit esters. Hops are kept to a minimum, and are just enough to add a nice bitterness that takes the edge off of the sweetness of the chocolate. But make no mistake: chocolate is the primary flavor. It's the first thing you'll taste, and the flavor that will linger on your tongue the longest.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,fountainofyouth,4.25,"Taken from notes earlier this week. I will only post what I can remember with certainty. This was a 22 oz. bottle poured into a Nonic pint glass.  Appearance: Dark as Coca-Cola without ice, almost black. Opaque as a wall. Pours a two-finger light brown bubbly head, darker than Guinness.  Smell: A blast of sweet chocolate right off the bat, with darker chocolate and some oats detectable as well. A little bit of hops.  Taste: This is INTENSE; the flavors are very, very dark. Burnt coffee is the lead flavor, with baker's chocolate trailing behind. (It's like an extra-strength Dominion Oak Barrel Stout, if that helps.) The hops finish is very light, which is a relief in light of the bitterness of the malt! The bottle says this thing is 69 IBUs, which I easily believe. It's a ""sweet"" stout only in that it's got added flavor, but this thing is way more powerful than any Irish Dry I've ever tried.  I do like dark and roasty stouts, but the effect over time from drinking this beer is a mild metallic character. That's the only objective drawback.  Mouthfeel: Unfortunately, I don't recall the level of carbonation, which means it was probably unremarkable. I found the body to be light-to-medium.  Overall: This is a special-occasion beer. And by that I mean it's for when you want something really dark and hearty. (Also, it's not cheap.) But when you're in that mood, this thing will NOT disappoint. A very bold beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Buggies,4.3,"What can you say about this one really. Smells like chocolate and tastes like chocolate. With that being said, nothing is really over the top. It also has other features that make it great.  It has the nice typical bitter punch from the highly roasted grains in a stout. Yet, there is an underlying earthiness that this beer has. It gives it a little extra special something between the upfront chocolate and the ending bitter bite.  The flavors get back a little as it warms. But could can wait for it to warm?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,russwbeck,3.48,"A: Deep brown pour with a big bubbly brown head. Retention is phenomenal as a thick cap sits atop the liquidy beneath.  S: Dark chocolate smell that seems a bit watered down. Not really much else going on.  T: The seems a bit strange to me. A lot of roasted malts up front, followed by the deep dark chocolate. Not a lot of sweetness to balance it out though. The flavor hits you and then sort of just drops right off.  MF: Medium to heavy body with great carbonation. I wish this beer was a bit ""fuller."" The 6% ABV is a bit limiting.  O: For a beer that is literally available everywhere, you can't go wrong here. If you're looking for something to blow you away, keep going.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,grannun,4.37,"A - Poured from a bomber into a delirium glass, figured I would take this one slow seeing as it's a stout.... Think black color, nearly opaque, with slight head.  S - Holy chocolate! A little but of hops and malt as well, but I guess I should expect the chocolate, right?  T - And again, holy chocolate! I don't think I have ever had a beer this chocolaty, but wow, is it good! Thick, smooth, and a little sweet. Very unlike most stouts in the sweetness upfront, very little hops and malt that I can detect.  M - High amount of carbonation for a stout, and incredibly smooth.  O - Wow! I am very impressed with this beer. Everything about it is excellent. I can see how any hop-head would find this disappointing due it's it's slight break from the style (less hoppy, less boozy), but can't wait to drink another bottle.

The head is a foamy, rich mocha color. gorgeous.  A- One dimensional, but incredibly distinct. Smells like a chocolate milk that has been sitting out in the sun. A little musty, and buttery. It's a smell you'll never forget... even if you want to.  T- Mirrors the taste. The chocolate notes are there, but they're not becoming of a Stout. I've have ""chocolate"" Porters and Stouts, but it never tastes like this. This reminds me of artificially sweetened cocoa powder.... not a chocolate stout. DISTINCT American hops. They're not the main feature, but they're unavoidable, particularly in the finish. If it were competing w/ Aunt Jemima's Syrup, I'd call it a competitive attempt, but I'd pick the syrup.  I'm sounding harsh, but only beause of other beers I have had. I do enjoy drinking this, but it's not a hallmark Stout.  It finishes dry... and it's unoffensive: those are features to its credit.  M- creamy, almost silky. Gives way to dryness.  O- Not my cup of tea. I was expecting more. ROGUE's Oatmeal Stout blows this away!!! I'd pick most any ROGUE beer I have had over this one; though I'm not familiar with more than half their line-up.  This just tastes too one-dimensional, and that flavor isn't overwhelmingly appealing. In fact, I could almost do without it.  I guess this beer can be regarded like lots of visiting family members: they're great at first, but then they just become nagging.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,greenmonstah,3.66,"A - Pours a deep brown, nearly black, but with some visibility through the very edges. Head grows to about one and a half fingers and appears a beautiful mocha color.  S - Chocolate, like tootsie rolls, but it doesn't linger. A very ""brief"" aroma. On second thought, I am best reminded of chocolate milk when I take a whiff.  T - Strong chocolate flavor with a clean grainy finish. The finish has a ""chemical"" component that is off putting. I liken this to Southern Tier's Choklat, but with a less sweet and much more bitter chocolate flavor. Also, it isn't as strongly flavorful or as tasty as that beer. This makes since, as that is an imperial take on the chocolate stout and this is not, but I am left wanting a bit more. The beer is not balanced at all, it is simply chocolate with the weird aftertaste of chemical laced cocoa. Color me a bit disappointed.  M - Medium body and a surprising amount of carbonation. Slightly dry like a dark chocolate bar.  O - Overall this is an average chocolate stout in my mind. It has much more intense flavor than most American Stouts, but the flavor is too tightly focused and honestly not too exciting because of it. A fine beer, but I certainly won't pay the 6-7 dollars it costs to get a bomber of it here. Perhaps if I lived in Portland again I could give it another shot.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

I get alot of the walnut taste with this, a little chocolate, very earthy and its getting more earthy / roasty as this pint glass ends. Aftertaste is fairly bitter and nutty. I expected this a bit sweeter but a fine beer to relax with and watch a movie. At 650ml per bottle, when you have finished your pint you have a few more litres to look forward to!!

Smell was loaded with dark roasty malts, chocolate and a sweet smell that reminds me of dark fruits. The taste was more chocolate than anything. It tastes strongly of powdered semi-sweet chocolate. I even got hints of hoppy bitter the roasty malts that have a slightly smokey taste as well.  Aftertaste was purely the chocolate with bitterness coming through on the back of the tongue in the later stages.

132,1118,tobelerone,4.07,"Beautiful dark beer falling short of being complete black in color. The nose carries lots of bittersweet chocolate, getting you excited about what's to come. Really appealing taste, chocolate is fully in effect, as well as a bit of hoppy bitterness that's fairly restrained. The finish lingers but doesn't overstay its welcome. Mouthfeel is medium, thin enough to avoid coating the mouth too much. A nice chocolate stout, not very boozy, thick or syrupy. Pretty drinkable but a shared bomber was all I needed. I liked that this one wasn't too over the top or excessively big.  The booze, hops, sweetness and viscosity of this beer are all pretty low, allowing the bittersweet chocolate flavor and aroma to come to the fore. Well done.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Taste is smooth dark chocolate, roasted malt, hints of vanila.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a slightly bitter finish.  Overall, good but not particularly complex or unique. Even after allowing it to warm for a while, not much changes. I've had several chocolate stouts and this one doesn't really stand out. But not bad either.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,magictacosinus,4.42,"Poured into a tulip glass out of a bomber with no freshness date.  Appearance: Quite literally, no light passes through the strong, opaque blackness that is this beer. Contains a vividly thick head with brownish hues. As it warms up, most of the head vanishes, which is common with beers like this.  Smell: Strong, vivid smells of chocolate, coffee beans, cream and milk, cane sugar, and even vanilla.  Taste: The taste of dark chocolate is immediately present alongside a roasted, smokey flavor. It's hard to believe that this is a beer, as it strongly resembles a bitter mocha. This is an impressively rich and complex brew: the taste is very overwhelming yet the alcohol is barely noticeable. The hops grant it an extra kick reminiscent of chili spices.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and thick (and dry) like no stout I've had before. The hops briefly tingle the tongue but do not last. The chocolate flavor is (rightly so) extremely overpowering, but the malts are easily distinguishable. To my surprise, this beer warmed up my throat and forehead.  Overall: Incredible! This is a delectable treat that should be enjoyed on any cold, misty evening. Cheers to Rogue for successfully crossbreeding a hot chocolate and a beer at the same time. The only quarrel I have with this beer is its overwhelming drinking factor. Simply put, it's so rich that I could never have an entire bottle on my own. Due to this, this is a good brew to share amongst friends and acquaintances as a wonderful aperitif - or a good replacement for an after-meal espresso.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smells like chocolate and malts  The taste is dominated by harsh roasted/burnt notes, with a bitter aftertaste. Some dark chocolate and fruit hints too but they're not huge due to a high level of carbonation. This reduces as you drink.  Overall quite a good beer. The burnt notes are too strong for my liking but it is alright nonetheless.  Edited to add .5 to the taste and mouthfeel because as you drink it seems to get smoother.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Good aroma with, um, chocolate. But, more coming along as well. Some roasted malt and even a hint of earthy hops. Not overpowering but nice.  Mmmmm. The flavor is a potent mix of the aforementioned aromas in even tastier measures. The chocolate seems a little darker in the flavor than I expected from the aroma. Excellent notes of roasted malt, hops, and coffee keep this one from being too sweet. Thank you, Rogue. I don't like overly sweet beers.  Fairly light mouthfeel that is very drinkable.

This has a beautiful dark chocolate color, with a 3cm head that's a nice caramel shade. The head holds for a good 3 minutes before dissolving into a lace.  S - Wow, that chocolate really comes through in the nose. Smells of dark chocolate with caramel and a hint of coffee beans. Man, that's good.  T - It tastes like a stout should, to be sure. There's the chocolate confirmed, with a hoppy note that's not overdone; I get a fruity more than piney hop sensation, that fruit being graefruit, but it's not overpowering. I am liking this.  M - Good. Medium-bodied, not over-carbonated, with a hoppy finish. I've certainly had worse.  O - Good beer.

Messy, sticky lacing all over the glass.  A tremendously chocolatey aroma. This smells like real, ooey, gooey, melted, delicious chocolate. Some roasted malt in the background, but the chocolate aroma here is superb! Again, perfect.  A sweet and bitter chocolate stout. It's not as sweet as the nose would suggest, which I actually think is a good thing. Roasted malts and lots of chocolate make up this stunning stout. As advertised. For chocolate lovers: seek this one out!  Unfortunately, the only thing average about this beer is it's mouthfeel. It's simply nothing special, not something poor. It's decidedly average, which is unfortunate because I've had other Rogue stouts with very good mouthfeels. This one simply seems a bit too thin, though it is well carbonated.  The mouthfeel doesn't detract much from this beer. It's nearly perfect. Chocolate lovers all over the world need to be introduced to this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Beer is very dark-- really surprised this isn't an imperial stout.  S: Sweet chocolate, roasted nuts, grains, slightly curdled vanilla milk and a strong oatmeal character. Again really surprised this is a single stout, lots of aroma flowing from this.  T: Pretty much the same as the nose but less vanilla and the chocolate was a little more bitter than expected, which was actually welcome. Solid taste.  M: Like most nitros I kind of get torn because the head is so creamy it's hard for the body to match. Despite it being a common problem I really felt the beer itself was too watery for the taste and the head, it was really mismatching. Otherwise I thought the tastes spread well and it was pleasant to have in the mouth.  O: I honestly haven't enjoyed the vast majority of rogue beers I've had before but this one caught me off guard.

132,1118,seabass87,4.5,"Poured from 650 ML bottle into glass.  A- Opaque black with a short creamy brown head. The head dies down quickly, but it leaves a brilliant swirly, milky topper through the entirety of consuming. Very small bits of carbonation on the sides of the glass. Some isolated lacing around the sides of the glass.  S- As expected, this is predominately sweet chocolate with roasted malts. I'm getting some hazelnut undertones. The advantage this has over its peers is that the chocolate smell is very pronounced without smelling dark, too rich or overbearing. Seems well balanced for the style. Smells absolutely delicious.  T- We first get a dose of milky chocolate, but it doesn't hit as hard as you might think. We are smoothly transitioned into medium roasty malts, hazelnut, and biscuit flavors. Has an incredible aftertaste of chocolate biscotti and just a very small amount of flavorful bitterness. Yum.  M- There is a surprising level of carbonation in this beer. It has a light body for a stout, and finishes neither dry nor wet (just right). The relatively low ABV is what makes these things possible, and I applaud Rogue for being able to make the tradeoff.  O- I enjoyed this beer immensely. It's similar in some ways to the Shakespeare Stout (especially the mouthfeel/carbonation). I like the fact that even though it definitely is a Chocolate stout, the flavoring is balanced and mild enough so that you can drink this without it feeling like you're drinking dessert. I also appreciate the fact that they were able to avoid it getting into mocha/coffee territory - not that I don't enjoy the coffee taste, but it is somewhat commonplace for stouts of this nature to rely too heavily on coffee to cover the alcohol bite. This is a beer that accomplishes it's style with flying colors. I will definitely be coming back to this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Milk and cream mixed with cocoa powder followed by roasted malts. A bit chalky and nutty. Finishes with soft sweetness and dry malt.

132,1118,zoso1967,4.08,"Chocolate Stout pours a deep dark blackish brown that shoes just a touch of reddish highlights. The head is mocha (go figure) colored and made up of very tightly packed bubbles. Both lacing and head retention are above average.  The aroma is definitely chocolaty. Dark cocoa comes on strong with some chalky and charred notes also making their presence felt.  The flavor is very similar to the aroma with plenty of chocolate character making itself known. This beer is not ""Chokolat"" chocolaty, but it is up there. The same slightly chalky character that I got in the aroma is present in the flavor as well, as are some dark and roasty flavors. I also detect just a touch of earthy hop like flavors. This is possibly pretty old bottle and I almost wonder if this is just the remnants of stronger initial hop flavors.  The mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium with a carbonation that is just present enough for me to not complain about it being too low. The beer is smooth and coating, leaving plenty of bitter cocoa to linger on my palate after swallowing.  All in all this is a pretty darn good beer. It is well crafted and definitely has some good chocolate flavors. I picked it up largely because I knew it was highly rated, but found that it did not really stick out that much to me. Perhaps I am just used to the crazy chocolate flavors found in some other newer beers like ST Chokolat, but this one just did not blow me away.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,afksports,4.02,"It's been a while since having a few glasses of this beer, and I'm reviewing my notes on it. First - the coolest part about the beer was that I got to drink it at Brooklyn Botanic Garden on Chile Pepper festival day where the best chiles and chocolates come together for a taste explosion. After a pour of the regular chocolate stout, I had a ""holy mole"" blend of the chocolate stout and chipotle ale that did a great job harmonizing the two tastes of the day. Plus, I got to drink both with Mrs. Chocolate Stout herself - the lady on the bottle. Can anyone say twitpic?!?  Anyhow, the beer: It pours a medium brown to black with a tan head. Points lost here on the sexiness of the beer because the head dissipates and doesn't cling to the glass, but otherwise it's what you want it to be. An instant waft up an aroma of nuts, malt, and a blend of bitter and sweet chocolate grips your nosebuds, and the taste follows suit. There's even a tiny hop presence in the taste at the start, but that's quickly shoved aside by the chocolate. Sadly though, it's not the strongest of chocolate beers, nor the boldest. There is a crisp bitterness though, and it absolutely has a clean finish. The mouthfeel is a little disappointing too, as it's less than Guinness thick, and much more of a light to medium body.  But overall I'd have to give this beer props for what it does. It is a quality chocolate stout that sits on every bodega shelf. It exposes people to a new style, and it's become a go-to beer for my close friend who doesn't drink them. Plus it's affordable. There's a lot to be said for those qualities in a brew, and so I've got to notch up the ""overall"" rating to a 4.0, where otherwise it might be around a 3 out of 5.

The head dissipates very slowly to a thick film which remains throughout the drink and leaves moderate to heavy lacing.  S: Strong milk chocolate aromas are immediately noticed and dominate the scent. Hints of dark chocolate and roasted malts. Milk chocolate scent continues to hit the nose with every sip of the beer. Absolutely fantastic aroma. Bravo.  T: The first sip is dominated by earthy roasted malt flavors. The milk chocolate that dominates the scent is nearly undetectable initially. The chocolate characters that are present are more bitter/bakers chocolate and dark chocolate and are not nearly as prevalent as the aroma implies. However, like most good stouts, it improves throughout the drink as it warms, and the chocolate characters being to come out, although still not as prevalent as I had anticipated from the scent and the grassy/earthy characters continuing to be the most prominent flavors. Some dark chocolate is present in the aftertaste, and occasionally some mild hop bitterness is noted at the end of a sip.  M/D: Slightly over carbonated for my liking. I was expecting a creamier and smoother drink. Although again the mouth feel improves as the beer warms. It is relatively light for a stout, and thus is very easy to drink, even in the 22 oz bomber variety.  O: It’s good, maybe even very good, but not great.

The beer pours a nice, viscous looking jet black with a thick, dense, foamy milk-chocolate colored head. Aromas are heavy in milk chocolate, with only the slightest hint of bitter coffee. It's like someone poured a splash of coffee into a chocolate milkshake. The beer is mid-bodied; a little light and crisp, but still fairly smooth in mouth. The flavor is a blend of dark chocolate bitterness and milk chocolate sweetness. Can't really go wrong with that in this house...I am a fat kid with a wicked sweet tooth! The coffee highlights are minimal, but present, and they peek their head out towards the aftertaste portion of your experience. Bitterness in the aftertaste does a good job of balancing all the sweetness throughout and closing the door on a very wonderful beer experience overall. The finish is smooth on the flavor and crisp in the body. Once again, very well balanced. This is a strong showing from the Rogue Brewery!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kjussel,4.45,"Appearance: As you would expect from an American Stout... Deep, dark brown/black. The head does not linger, but is a coffee bean brown (without the taste of coffee!). Just one of those beers--as is the case with most Rogue brews--that you just know you are going to enjoy.  Smell: Very chocolatey on the nose with an undertone of roasted malts and black patent. Cannot emphasize the chocolate more... Smells of really raw, dark chocolate nibs.  Taste: The chocolate does not disappoint, as it is front and center when it hits your tongue, followed by the lingering roasted flavors of the malts with dry, residual bitterness from the black malts. Oh, oh so tasty.  Mouthfeel: The malty/roasted flavors really, really linger. The tasty elixer rests in your mouth, but does not leave a dextrin-like smacky feeling. Take a drink of coffee right after this (I know, a combination of vices), and you will be a very happy person.  Overall: Truly one of my favorite American Stouts... I have tried so many, especially this past winter, and this one just always rises to the top.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,snpub540,4.08,Poured half of a bottle into my Duvel tulip. It pours a deep black hue that no light is getting through. Half a finger of light brown creamy bubbles makes up the head. Very light amount of lacing is left on the glass between sips.  Aroma is mostly toasted bread and sweey chocolate. There is also a hint of raisins and licorice. That's all I got out of this nose.  Taste is a nice roasty and bitter combination that has lots of chocolate and roasted malt flavors. There is also some woody and coffee notes mixed in as well. A hint of sweetness right upfront but it is quickly gone.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Not a lot of carbonation and it adds to the smoothness of this beer. To me it is pretty mild but is still able to pack in a lot of flavor.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,phiberoptik,3.06,"Pours a nice dark black with a mocha creamy head. It has some beautiful lacing as well as I let the the head dissipate.  Right off the bat I get some roasted maltiness in the nose. Dry cocoa powder and crusty bread as well. The more I smell it, for lack of a better description, it reminds me of when you first enter an old attic. Kind of musty and stale, but not necessarily bad.  The taste is nothing of what I expected. Right up front it threw me off with a chalky, dry cocoa taste. I guess after reading the bottle it makes sense but I get very earthy grains as well. I do not get a lot in the middle but I get bitterness in the finish as well as some burnt coffee grounds which I always enjoy.  This beer is thin without a ton of body. I might be biased as I have been drinking mostly bigger, imperial stouts lately with a lot more viscosity.  Over all this is an interesting beer that surprised me. I am glad I tried it but I was expecting a bit more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Fippy_Darkpaw,4.12,"A - Dark slick pour into the glass. Pours black with a cocoa head.  S - This was the highlight of the beer for me. Smells like bittersweet dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and roasted malts.  T - A little sweet and a little roast. Was expecting more chocolate based on the nose, still obtained a little though.  M - Medium bodied mouthful, seemed just the right amount of carbonation. Smooth and goes down easy.  O - Was nice to have a big bomber stout that didn't knock me on my butt from the high abv. Will seek this out again when I'm looking for an easy and smooth stout. Fair price too.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,1noa,3.58,"Pours a deep dark brown with little head into snifter, and settles into light lace. Initial aromas of chocolate and malt. On first sip you can taste the chocolate and hops with light carbonation. Well balanced across the palate and not too heavy on the chocolate flavor. Overall, a smooth stout. Look forward to having it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Andreji,3.65,"Bottle purchased at whole foods in union square.  Poured into a pint glass. very dark toned and opaque, brown-to-black coloured. The head is ephemeral, but leaves behind a brownish chocolatey lacing and thin film topping the beer.  The smell is nice, dark chocolatey and with an underlying congnac-key feel making it sort of truffle-ish. some hoppiness can be felt but the smell is certainly sweeter.  The taste however wasn't so pleasant. It was a bit too dry for my taste, rather having a very simple grainy sensation at first which is quickly and clearly taken over by the bitter feel. At a point it feels smokey and somewhat like some seriously barrel aged scotch. it's not bad but there's much less of a sweet, chocolate sensation than one would expect. it is also quite alcoholicky, or at least feels so as it goes down the throat. It is also fairly full bodied, making it hard to go much further than 1 or 2 pints.  Overall not a bad beer but doesn't stand much chance against nicer chocolate stouts such as convict hill.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,shwhat,4.03,"look - big, fluffy, dark tan head. filled with huge, medium and small bubbles. almost pitch black body. completely opaque.  smell - chocolate and chocolate. and more chocolate. also a bit of a roasty character. maybe even a fruity scent?  taste - sweet chocolate up front. mostly dark chocolate, but the creaminess suggests a semi-sweet or milk chocolate as well. roasty malt in the middle and a bit of a bitter finish at the end.  feel - thinner than i would have thought. definitely a medium body, more towards the thick side...but i expected a thick, creaminess. a bit of a prickle from the carbonation. a bit sticky on the lips.  overall - i dig it. i've only ever had two chocolate stouts: this and young's double chocolate (which i didn't really like since it was one of the first beers i had ever had besides BMC)...i think if i went back to young's, i'd like it a lot more now. either way, not the biggest fan of stouts, but this one is pretty delicious.  EDIT: decided to pull out a dark chocolate fudge brownie to pair with it. holy crap...so freaking delicious. the bitterness of the beer begs for a bite of the sweet brownie, which then necessitates a sip of the brew. match made in heaven.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,match1112,4.45,from the bottle to my glass it poures black with brown highlights around the edges and a two finger milk chocolate colored head. the smell up front was chocolate followed by a slight roasted smokeyness with more chocolate. taste was sweet malts at first followed by bitter dark chocolate. nice and thick on the tongue with a smokey bitterness in the back of your mouth. awesome stout cant wait to try again.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jsprain1,4.38,"A- Looks to be black with the slightest of ruby highlights. Head is cocoa colored. Retention is decnet with one solid thick lacing. S- Smell is slightly citric hops and a good roastyness, but the chocolate is the biggest player. T- A bit of citrus up front, and a bit of roastyness. The finish is where the chocolate shows up in force. M- Dry at first, but it stick to the tongue in the finish. Decently full body for the style. Soft and low levels of carbonation O- A well made stout. It basically boils down to if you're a purist about the whole chocolate thing. I for one think it turned out splendidly. Near the top of the stout ladder for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,chickenm,3.23,"Pours dark brown with a fluffy tan head and some sediment. Aroma is basically just sweet chocolate, can't smell much else. Not a fan of the taste, it's mostly chocolate cocoa and a little burnt coffee. Mouthfeel is a little light but decent enough. Overall this one was a let down, I'd prefer it if it wasn't completely dominated by the chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,wcintula,4,"Pours beautifully black with a big chocolate colored head that's makes good use of the oats in the beer and sticks all the way down the glass. The smell is a strong chocolate/cocoa smell, enjoy it, don't look for much else. The taste is pretty light, as is the body, which is an unfortunate surprise after seeing and smelling it. It's a chocolate taste, with the roasted malts very noticeable, finishing bitter. This beer is very good, but isn't quite perfected yet.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,NODAK,4.02,"One of the best aromas to come around in a while for me. Very decadent chocolate here...sweet, silky...you can really smell the cocoa nibs here. A slight hint of hop bitterness as well but this is a very chocolatey aroma.  Pours midnight black in the glass...nice, frothy dark brown head with fair staying power.  The taste isn't quite as rich, however. The body is a bit light, and the taste is certainly full of chocolate, but is more of a mix between a sweeter chocolate and a bitter, roasted chocolate. This marriage keeps it from becoming cloying or just being too bitter. The 69 IBU's assert themselves at the end with a fairly hoppy finish for style, which seems a bit floral. The bitterness lingers a little after the swallow.  What was a pretty sweet and rich beer on the nose wasn't quite so on the tongue. Despite that, it's a solid beer for the style even if I was hoping for a more decadent beer (a la Young's).",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,WillCarrera,4.3,"A- Pours jet black and completely opaque. Big two fingers of cake-like, mocha brown head. Pretty good lacing.  S- Not surprisingly, chocolate. Lots of it. The bottle says ""chocolate truffle"" and I'm gonna have to agree, smells just like one of those truffles covered in powdered chocolate. Not picking up on a lot of grain or bread in the nose, no hops at all.  T- Loads of bitter dark chocolate and powdered chocolate. Very little sweetness. Good amounts of smokey char and some relatively light roasted malts. Finishes dry and bitter.  M- Full bodied and creamy. Good amounts of carbonation.  O- Absolutely delicious. It really keeps it simple, when they say chocolate they mean it. It's brewed with actual chocolate and by the time I finished my glass some chocolate ""sediment"" had settled on the bottom. Surprisingly drinkable, I didn't have any problem killing a bomber of this on my own.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S - upon first smell I get definite roasty black malt and roasted barley wafting up. No real hint of chocolate in the nose. But definitely what I expect for any stout.  T - Up front, I get burnt grains and coffee-like bitterness. The chocolate is not as prevalent as I expected, but I definitely don't have to search for it. It comes through nicely after the initial roastiness and becomes more noticeable as I work my way through the glass. Only downside is I get a lasting astringency at the end that is almost metallic in nature. Not enough to be unsettling, but different.  M - Not quite as thick as I would hope for a stout. I know that's not a do-or-die characteristic, but it's something I hope for! Nice bright carbonation that compliments the dark character of the beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BelgiumBill,4.62,"Dumped hard into a Guinness pint glass which produced a massive fluffy brown head which left gobs of lace in the glass and released a huge chocolaty nose. There is no guessing what you are about to drink here.  The flavors were more chocolate and more chocolate, oh and did I say chocolate?  My 4 year old daughter asked if I liked it and I told her it was like dessert in a glass.  Some hops present which added to the arrangement. Nice velvety mouthfeel.  I could drink this everyday and at 6% I can drink it without the commitment I would be making to the Night Tripper Imperial Stout which weighs in at 10.8%ABV.  Really good but this is my preferred style so perhaps a bit biased.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Kegatron,4.12,"On tap @ Tria (Philadelphia, PA) on 4/2/11. Served in a pint glass.  Pours black in the glass, topped with a ½ finger of smooth looking burnt mocha head. This retains well, leaving back a foamy cascade of lacing that quickly slides down the sides of the glass. Chocolate is strong and delicious smelling in the nose, rounded out on the edges by notes of roast and green citrus. This smells great!  The taste doesn't miss a step, with rich chocolate flavors carrying on here, but this seems to be much more assertive with the roasted malt and hops, which really dries the backend of the profile out. Lingering burnt roast, in particular, is strong. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied, with a pleasant mellow prickliness that flows well across the palate. That 6% ABV feels right-on here, with no alcohol flavors or even warmth being picked up at all.  This is one of those Rogue beers that I only try once in a blue moon but it never ceases to impress me. My wife always exclaims that ""it tastes like a liquid tootsie roll!"" and I'm inclined to agree. This is one of the few Chocolate Stouts out that there really brings those rich chocolate flavors to the table and then some!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A bit muted for the style, but it's still good.  M - The mouthfeel is good. Though a hint watery, the carbonation is solid. I like that the taste lasts a while in the mouth after the swallow.  Overall, a good beer. A bit muted for the style, but it's still a pretty good example.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jackie7787,3.47,"A- Pours pretty dark brown, a bit of a light brownish head but not too much and dissipated quickly leaving just a bit of swirly light brown foam on top.  S - Smells strongly of chocolate and a hint of roastiness!  T- Something kind of overpowers the chocolate and roastiness. It was really bitter at first. It was a bit too much, more than I was expecting at least. I didn't think it went with the beer very well. Finished with nice bittersweet chocolate flavor though. I guess it got a little better over time too, but still couldn't really get past the initial bitterness that came with every sip.  M - This was good. Not overly carbonated or anything. Pretty light and smooth.  D- While it was decent overall, I probably won't be having it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bierschmecktgut,3.24,"Received from tap with shallow head, super dark, not much color when held up to light either.  Smell was faint of burnt coffee and chocolate, minimal aromas leaping off pint. Even after a few swirls I felt the smell could've stood out a bit more.  Very clean, chocolate is immediate with hints of roasted coffee. The bitterness reminded me of unsweetened bakers chocolate rather than any hops. Bitterness was medium on the finish but left a chocolate-coffee aftertaste.  Medium/Heavy body with a typical stout palate coating to the tongue. The creaminess was nice and went down pretty easily.  It paired well with dessert but wouldn't consider as a session beer or anything outside of a dinner/dessert beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Covered my palate really well.  O: Paired extremely well with some dark chocolate almonds I was eating with; great dessert drink that's for sure. My uncle asked me whose drink *this* was; I offered a taste; he said it was good; I offered the rest to him and he took me up on my offer.

Ive heard and read so much about this stout so when i saw it my heart stopped and i had to take it in for a second.  Upon opening my slightly chilled first bottle i was hit with an incredibly potent aroma of chocolate.  I poured slowly into a bowl stout glass and was greeted with a beautifully dark, thick and almost oil like liquid that filled my nasal cavities with chocolate, coffee, cream, nutmeg and even hints of scotch whiskey.  Taste was incredible. Beautiful hit of cocoa which burst off in tangents to give way for coffee, nutmeg and even syrup.  Coated my palatte with a lovely film of alcoholic flavour which stayed long after the first sip. As i moved on down the glass the taste didnt diminish nor become too intense.  I am very impressed with this and whenever i see it you can be sure ill be stocking up. I have saved 4 bottles of the six that i brought and am literally fighting myself to not open them.

132,1118,bobhits,4.22,"I hate explaining the look of a stout. It's deep dark brown/black, opaque, and there's gasp a tan head. Lots of lacing and I'll give you that this looks a bit thicker than expected in a 6% beer.  The nose is that of coco and American hops. An interesting experience with chocolate (not just a burn malt aroma that gives off a dark chocolate like smell) and citrus American hops. I recall seeing chocolate and orange flavored candies in the past and thinking they were pretty awful, but this somehow seems to work. The chocolate aroma starts strong, but swirling the beer in the glass gives way to far stronger hops. There's a bit of a vanilla/buttery like aroma at the finish as well.  Chocolate rushes in to start, hops take over, buttery notes, and the finishing with a bitter chocolate finish. An amazingly amount of flavor and complexity and at 6%...just wow. For a brewer I often think of primarily for absurd prices and below average beers this one is just over priced.  I need more from a beer with this much flavor and complexity. I want a bit more cream, or oil, or something to have the mouth feel match the rest of the beer. That said it's nice to open a bomber I know won't leave me intoxicated.  I really need to find this on tap as I expect it to be rather reasonably priced. That said this is exceptional beer. While I miss the intense power and weight of the double chocolate, but the hop flavors here are just exceptional and really add a lot of the beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S: Cocoa nibs, herbal, earthy hop aromas that are muted next to the brown sugar, molasses and chocolaty aromas of the brew.  T: Rich, creamy roasted black malts with Yoo-Hoo! added to it. Seriously, this brew tastes like it had Nesquik blended into the malt bill, which has otherwise bittersweet chocolate and black malt flavors leading into a dry, balanced, sweet and creamy finish.  M: Full-bodied and creamy stout with hints of sticky sweet cocoa powder resins left on the palate.  D: A true dessert stout with built-in chocolate companion flavors to boot.

Getting the obvious out of the way first, it's a stout with chocolate in it, so the appearance is a No Duh: black, generous brown head that lingers quite awhile. There's still a 1/2inch layer. Smell is chocolate and more chocolate, somehow both bitter and the sweet kind at once, a bit of nuttiness (almond, kind of) in the background.  ...wow. For something that sounds like such a simple concept (stout + chocolate), the actual taste is way more complex. Somehow even a bit of tart fruit is in the background, which ends up amping up the chocolate. Underneath all that is the backbone of a good dry stout, and goes down accordingly, w/ a slight warming.

Roasty barley, citrus hops in the background.  T - Wow, is this exceptional. This chocolate stout nails it on the head for me. Its so chocolaty but in a totally natural and not-cloying way. Its also got a nice roasted malt component but not so much to where it begins to make the brew harsh. It simply complements the general theme adding a bittersweet note. this is like mainlining pure dark chocolate but in a way that's pleasurable and not overthetop sweet. Rather dry and a hop bitterness is featured surprisingly strongly thoughout the mid and backend - but very refined and nicely (think orange zest mixed with the finest quality cocoa). Superb. Makes my heart giddy.  M - awesome texture - relatively full bodied with the right amount of booze and everything else to make this texturally phenomenal as well as delicious on taste. the tastes become richer and more intriguing with every additional sip you take.

Great head clings all the way through. Beautiful color. A beer milk shake! Great for dessert or just drinking by itself. Ample 22oz bottle presents well like all rogue products. Hops low but present enough to counteract chocolate. Fantastic! I want more!,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jar2574,4.21,"A beautiful looking pour. Nice thick tan head that sticks around forever. Excellent lacing. Very dark beer. Smells and tastes of chocolate and some roasted malts. Creamy, milky. Very well balanced, nothing overpowering. A great session beer or one to enjoy for dessert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,zrab11,4.57,A- pours a think chocolate milk color with a nice foamy head.  S-OMG the smell of this is heavenly. Has a great chocholate aroma..its like feeding your nose a chocolate bar!  T-Has a wonderfull sweet chocolate taste to begin with then in the middle it his you with alittle booze just to remind you that your still drinking a beer then finishes off smooth  M-Medium bodied with a great feel in your mouth  D-This is one of my favorite beers in this style. This is like a wonderful desert at the end of a great dinner. WOuld use this as a finishing beer any night of the week! Great beer,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Michelle1069,4.97,"Chocolate + Beer, does it get any better than that! This beer is easy to drink, very smooth. For me there was no bitter after taste. By the end of the beer it did get warm and was not as tasty as it was first opened, nice and cold. I do like Stouts a little heavier than this one. But all in all I very much enjoyed it and would buy it anytime!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,cneville,4.45,"Saw this on tap at a local restaurant, and had never tried it. Sampled it beforehand so I didn't have to commit fully, but I am certainly glad I did. Came out almost black, with a tan 2 finger head. As soon as I picked up the pint glass I smelled the chocolate--very sweet smelling. After tasting, however, i was pleasantly surprised at the taste--more of a bittersweet chocolate. I only had one, as it was a quick meal, but it certainly could have been more--the alcohol was barely noticeable, and it was not nearly as heavy as other stouts. Next time, I'll try to pair it more appropriately with food (pizza was an odd choice), but I am guessing that will not be too far in the future.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,SenkoSnack808,4.23,"This is bar far the best stout I have had, and everywhere I go I make an attempt to try any stout I find. The beer pours up with a monstrous tan head, maybe 2-3 fingers, with a pitch black body. The mouth feel is very creamy like, fairly thick but good. Taste is what you would expect, dark chocolate, coffee, the smokey aftertaste, not too much though. I have had many ""chocolate stout"" beers and this one is one the the few I have had that really has the feel taste of chocolate. Overall this beer is one of my go to stouts anytime, awesome beer!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,GoalieRon33,4.63,"Awesome overall beer. Not overly coffee-like, as many stouts are. Smooth chocolately goodness in every sip. Deep flavouring that leaves a smooth after taste. Just a hint of overall hoppage, but definitely noticeable throughout the sip. The only way to describe smell is to chock it up as a combination of a Starbucks and The Hershey Chocolate factory. Warming, smooth, and full bodied. Easy to drink, even for a heavy duty stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BeerCon5,4.4,"Pours pitch black in color with about one finger of coffee colored fluffy head that remains throughout the beer.  The scent is of mostly chocolate and roasted malt.  The taste is dominant of sweet chocolate, roasted malts, notes of coffee.  Medium body, smooth and creamy, low carbonation.  This was a very good stout, much lighter than I would expect making it easier to drink.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,notchucknorris,4.22,"A: Thick brown with a nice dark brown foamy head that sticks around forever and leaves great lacing.  S: Chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. Powdered cocoa smell is unbelievable.  T: Not as sweet as the smell suggests. Bittersweet chocolate with a slight hoppiness coming through the middle. A hard finish of bittersweet chocolate works well. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,devinoconnor,4.07,"Simply put, a wonderful stout from Rogue.  Pours a dark brown color.  Scent is what's advertised: chocolate stout.  Perfectly balanced taste. Chocolate is just right, not overly powerful.  Goes down smooth. Perfect as an after-dinner drink with dessert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Brunite,3.56,"Poured from a bomber into a giant mug.  A: Dark black. Aggressive pour yielded one of the best heads to date. Nitro looking with the carbonation going on.  S: Decent smelling stout. Chocolate and roasted malts.  T: Subdued chocolate. Not bad but was expecting more, considering the rep here. This is my second go around with this beer hoping I would get more chocolate next time. Does not come close to the chocolate notes in last night's Old Raspy.  M: Light for a stout. Not much as far as body or chewiness.  D: Easy to drink but rather pedestrian to my tastes. Something shy of World Class IMHO.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ForWhatAlesYou,4.7,"Bomber bottle into a pint glass  A: 100% pitch black, though it looks like a little bit of a brown tone. Pours a huge dark beige head.  S: Dutch process cocoa, coffee, and a light cigar smoke aroma. Sweet chocolate syrup.  T: Brilliant. Light hop bitter finishes off what I can only describe as perfection. Toasty chocolate and nice malty depth. Flavor=perfect.  M: Rich but not overwhelmingly thick.  D: Nearly 100% perfect. Right there with Surly Coffee Bender and Tallgrass Buffalo Sweat.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bishopdc0,3.9,"Had this on tap at Novare Res, the beer pours dark bubbles forming a creamy head  The aroma is maltly full of chocolate malt, nice sweet cocoa aroma and hints of a coffee roastedness.  The taste starts with a slight carbonation. The carbonation builds to reveal a sweet velvet feel. A milk chocolate flavor with a roasted finisht showcases a great mouth on this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Eriktheipaman,4.47,"One of the most ""black as oil"" beers Ive seen.  The smell was AMAZING with fresh but subtle chocolate and a nice crispness from the hops and carbonation.  The taste was very similar to the smell with chocolate with a slight roastiness and a nie little bitter in the middle.  This beer was a great choice after a nice meal on valentines and Ill have to pick it up again sometime in the future.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,SacredBeverage,4.78,"A: Very dark appearance, almost jet black with a brownish hue. Love the color.  S: In short, a great chocolate smell with dark malt and hops. Some nutty molasses in there as well.  T: I was a little skeptical of a chocolate Beer but Surprisingly it was blended well. You taste the chocolate mostly when it first hits your tongue and on the aftertaste. I like how you can taste the chocolate but it doesn't overpower it at all. Great brewing if you ask me. An awesome winter Beer to be savored.  M: Wow, I was surprised on how smooth this Beer was. Phenomenal texture, so creamy. I think the chocolate really comes through on the mouthfeel.  D: I could drink a lot of this, I don't want to put it down.  I highly recommend this beer if you are a fan of dark beers, it really is liquid gold. Awesome Beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,gueuzeonhigh,4.5,"Pours bible black as a fluffy frothy long lived sculptured head wells up from the surface. The tan-brown head reminds me of a meringue and indeed it's atop what's close to a dessert.  The nose pours forth with an avalanche of chocolate or cocoa. It reminds me of the smell of Hershey's cocoa-- the main ingredient in ""hot chocolate"". But it's not just cocoa-- the nose wells forth with wafts of hops, toasted malt, raisin flavor and caramel.  Flavor is memorable-- from now on every time I see the bottle the full bodied ""up front and center stage"" flavor will come to mind. Tons of everything- hops bitterness, but in style, chocolate of course, sweet malt, raisin and caramel. But the flavor isn't just a cavalcade of the above ingredients. It's rounded and well balanced so that all of the flavor ingredients work together to build the overall mouthfeel.  Mouthfeel is like swallowing velvet. It's extremely smooth and slides down- I love oysters on the half shell.. if you do too you'll know what I mean.  Drinkability -superior, the comparatively low ABV coupled with the ""warm fuzzy blanket"" like flavor profile make this a beer that I could enjoy for the entire evening- only to notice I've put down a half gallon!  Be warned-- this beer should be enjoyed on it's own. I can't think of a dish, besides chocolate mousse that this beer would complement.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TMoney2591,3.43,"Served in a plastic tumbler.  Another revisiting from me during this stretch. It pours a garnet-tinged black-brown topped by a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises, you guessed it, chocolate, along with some seemingly obligatory roasted malts. The taste merely sprinkles on the cocoa powder while simultaneously skimping on the roast as well. And, unfortunately, just like the smell, there ain't nuthin' else happenin' up in here. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, despite this being easy to drink, I really don't have much of an inclination to do so. It's not really bad (meaning offensive), but it's far from very good.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,EricCioe,4.15,"This pours black with a two finger tan head that sticks around with very light lacing. The nose is chocolate (!), huge, dark chocolate truffles, some roasty malt underneath and more chocolate. The chocolate fades in the mouth a bit, and it's surprisingly thin bodied for a stout, but the dark chocolate flavors are definitely present. For such a sweet beer it's definitely drinkable, the low-ish alcohol content contributing to that a bit. I had it for dessert tonight after lamb loin chops that I served with Hop Stoopid. This beer is sort of similar to that one in that it's a one trick pony, but it's a good trick to have. Will buy again.  Updated 18 November 2011. Bumped up appearance and mouthfeel scores. Everything else still applies. Overall, this is a fine brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,websherpa,3.96,"Apperance: It's a stout, it's black. Some color showing through the sides but not through the middle. This has the most beautiful 2 finger chocolate ice cream colored head. Wow. A delicious looking beer.  Smell: Malty with the chocolate up front. I've read reviews saying milk chocolate but after several servings I still put this in the dark category. Maybe in the 60% range of chocolate bars.  Tastes: Pretty much same as the nose. Delicous, I keep coming back for more.  Mouthfeel: It's a little on the thin side, but not terribly so. Average. Carbonation is appropriate.  Drinkability: Had some fresh and not so fresh bottles in town check your drink by dates! I love coming back to this one, but have been disappointed a couple times when I purchased an older bottle without realizing.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bum732,4.33,"S: Rich milk chocolate, mocha notes.  L: Dark black, dark tan head with great lacing and retention.  T: Rich cocoa like malt with some mocha sweetness. Semi-sweet leading to medium bitterness, earthy. Finishes with some coffee roastiness and more hot cocoa, dry.  M: Medium bodied with medium carbonation.  Great chocolate in this beer, very mocha-like and just delicious. Fairly dry and not too sweet which helps drinkability.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bbb099,4.15,"650 ml bottle split with the gf for vday.  A - Pure black with frothy mocha colored-head. Good retention.  S - Chocolate syrup with notes of roasted malt.  T - Thick and sweet cocoa flavor followed by the roasted malt. The bitter combination of roasted malt and dark chocolate towards the end is quite pleasant.  M- Medium to full bodied. Moderate carbonation.  D - Had it on-tap a few days ago and the chocolate characteristics were a lot more prominent, so the bottled version is a little disappointing. Still a pretty solid stout though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Huhzubendah,4.53,"A: The appearance is outstanding. The beer appears opaque and jet black, with a towering, thick beige head over an inch thick. After several minutes, the head slowly begins to dissipate, leaving ample lacing all over the tulip glass.  S: The aroma is fabulous, with dominant scents of chocolates and chocolate syrup, followed by a roasted malt character.  T: The taste does not disappoint. Chocolate syrup and melted chocolates consume the palate without ever being overly sweet. Roast and coffee flavors come in behind, creating a wonderful and delicate dance.  M: The feel is great. Smooth and creamy, with just the right carbonation level.  D: I honestly didn't think I could drink so much of this beer and still want more. I drank most of the bomber by myself, and was a bit bummed when it ran out. A superb marriage of chocolate and beer - highly recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Jesse13713,3.03,"Appearance - A huge fistful of head that exploded over the mug and out onto the floor. A rich chocolate frothy lump on top. Decent lacing.  Smell - Only chocolate and malt.  Taste - A cola-like chocolate that seemed slightly skunked. A more bitter chocolate. It honestly didn't taste all too different from the Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock I had earlier today.  Mouthfeel - A smooth and tasty coffee flavor. Remains a bit skunked. Perhaps I got an older bottle.  Drinkability - Easily drinkable and a little watery. I don't see anything too special in this stout.  Verdict - I personally couldn't find what was so special about this stout. One of the less impressive chocolate stouts I've had. As I said, perhaps my bottle was a little old.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,dragonWhale,2.33,"So it's officially my birthday now, but it was officially my coworker's birthday a few minutes ago when this beverage started to be consumed by him. Being that we have to be at work in about 8 hours, he decided, against my better judgment, that he needed to start making the walk up the hill to better prepare himself for the morning. I'm still not sure what this was all about. But, it was a free beer. As it sat for 23 seconds unmanned, I pondered my course of action. I was then able to determine that this was clearly an early birthday present from John Maier himself in some sort of misguided attempt to assuage me into liking Rogue beers. I obliged him. The milky chocolate dominates the beer, at first a delightful treat fading into a cloying sweet Nesquik chocolate drink. It smells great, thick chocolate rising into the air. But the chocolate is compromised somehow. It is no Theo's chocolate, a thing of pure glory. Sort of a fake chocolate luster. ""Natural chocolate flavoring."" What was wrong with chocolate? Too chocolatey? Not chocolatey enough? Whatever, it is what it is. Just a thick and sweet malty brew, not awful, not undrinkable, just not worth spending my money on. Sorry, John, I tried again..to be continued..(next season)",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Smakawhat,3.68,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  Giant head off pour with five fingers of nice light cocoa brown head. Dark brown body off the pour, body is almost a dark reddish brown. Head has lots of retention. Looks like a big beer no fooling. Some sticky lacing.  Smell is primarily chocolate of a nice almost dark in store chocolate counter. Very good quality chocolate it smells like. Nothing much else though. Strangely enough that primary chocolate smell is completely gone after you have a few sips of the beer. This beer needs aeration and a big pour to get the chocolate out, it wont come otherwise.  Taste makes you think a big sweet thing is coming but it's anything but. Hop bitters, and a wet body contribute to a sharp taste that is a little jarring, and also lacking some roast character. Not carbonated either. Very well hidden abv.  I am not exactly blown away by this, but maybe just a little disappointed. However, it does seem right for the style so I can't say this is something I wouldn't drink again or would even pan. It does some things quite well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kylejohnson03,4.42,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into an imperial pint glass. Pours a rich black, with a small tan head. Major milk chocolate aroma, reminds me of hot chocolate sitting in a mug that hasn't been heated up yet. Flavors are huge chocolate notes and sweetness, touch of roasted malt flavor and smoke. Touch of bitterness on the finish, with a creamy mouthfeel. A very balanced, full flavored stout. There's a reason that this is (currently) the top rated American Stout on BeerAdvocate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,sweemzander,3.83,"22oz. bottle poured into an imperial pint.  (A)- Pours a near pitch black color. Produced a giant fluffy tan head with great retention. Lacing all over the place.  (S)- A big rich and sweet chocolate aroma. Hints at molasses and raisin, but otherwise its a chocolate bomb!  (T)- Same as the smell. A rich chocolatey malty bomb. Some hints at rasin, but otherwise a straight-up chocolate brew.  (M)- A good carbonation level. A tad thinner than expected, but the massive chocolatey maltiness makes up for it.  (D)- Certainly a solid stout. A bit too sweet and chocolatey to have glass after glass of, but a great idea for dessert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,SolomonGrundy,3.46,"First off, $5.99/bomber and 6% ABV. OK priced, a little high. Pours a nice, opaque ultra-dark brown to black. Wonderful head, about 4 fingers high, springs up and persists, leaving excellent lacing. Aroma is oaded, almost too much so, with chocolate. Actually, once it settles and warms a touch, it smells like hot chocolate. Some faint espresso notes and also a touch of hops in there, but dominated, almost to a fault, by hot chocolate. Maybe a little cinnamon hint also.  Flavor is a confusing mix of hot chocolate and tangy chocolate malt. At first it wants to be malty, then the initial tang burst gives way, one-two punch-like, to a rich chocoalte flavor. This then washes away and is replaced by the tanginess of the malt and some nice hop bitterness. Not too sweet, but there is some in there. Finish is super long and bitter from both the hops and, I think, the chocolate flavoring used. Kind of a jumble and sort of a mess. Not worth the price but it is unique.  What I like most: The beautiful pour.  What I like least: The confused flavor profile.  Verdict: Unique and robust, but not worth the price. Novelty only.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BB1313,4.22,"22oz bomber poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a dark brown, almost black, w/ decent head and lacing. Lots of chocolate up front, nice nose. I'm picking up lots of malty aromas as well. Tastes great, once again alot of chocolate. Lots of burnt and roasty characteristics. There's a nice bitterness in the flavors, but remains pretty sweet. Mouthfeel is good, well carbonated and smooth; full-bodied. Drinkability isn't bad, great flavors, but the sweetness can become redundant. Nice beer to enjoy or have for dessert. Very bold beer!  Great offering from Rogue, I've always enjoyed this one. If you're looking for a chocolate bomb, this is a perfect place to start. Recommended!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,veinless,4.27,"Poured a dark black with no translucent edges to be seen. Dark mahogany head that was about half finger and foamy; did not retain well.  Smell was pure malt chocolate, with roasted cookies and raw cocoa in there.  Taste was better still, with dark chocolate followed by a milky cocoa, which was then balanced by a nice happy middle that kept the beer from becoming alcoholic nesquik.  Mouthfeel was thick and smooth, although a bit thinner than the other stouts I've reviewed recently. Drinkability was phenomenal, as the abv somehow yielded so much taste that I don't know how they did it. Really awesome, affordable beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,inlimbo77,4.17,"22oz bomber bottle poured into a DFH snifer glass. No bottle date on a Rogue beer again.  A: Pours a JET black with think tan head. THICK. Three, possibly four, finger head. GOOD carbonation. Nice sticky lacing.  S: CHOCOLATE chocolate CHOCOLATE....love it. Roasty malts there too. Some mild hops as well.  T: I get that chocolate that I was smelling, but not AS pronounced. Still amazing. Nice roasty malts and a solid slight hop bite to finish. Really tasty.  M: It was actually watery, which was surprising for the appearance. Not as mouth coating as I would have expected, but it didn't effect the overall that much.  D: With the mild 6% ABV, you could really get lost in this one. I drank the whole bomber with ease and could have continued with more.  Overall, this is a SOLID stout from Rogue we have here. Not imperial in ABV, but the smells and tastes are great for a normal stout. I would definitely reach for this one again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,robbrandes,4.33,"22oz bottle.  Pours midnight black, with a tremendous thick, billowing head. Smell is an incredible combination of baker's chocolate and roasted malt. Paired this beauty with a nice t-bone off the BBQ, and I was in heaven. The taste might sound off-putting with the chocolate being so prominent, but this beer has balance for days.  Mouthfeel is exceptional, I can only imagine the on-tap w/nitro!  This is truly a world-class beer, and impossibly affordable too! Major kudos to Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Rogue's chocolate stout surprised me with it's ability to bring the chocolate up front without hitting me over the head with it. Go ahead and read the other reviews to get an idea about pourability, aroma, taste, etc. I'm going to go ""outside the box"" and offer a suggestion. Try mixing Rogue Chocolate Stout with Rogue Hazelnut Nectar Ale. Drop me a line; let me know what you think.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Lacing was sticky. Smelled of faint chocolate, I'm not getting the overwhelming amount of chocolate like others have. Head comes back after agitation. The aromas get sweeter as the beer warms closer to room temp but still very mild in my opinion.  Feels great. Smooth without feeling too thick.

You didnt even need to be close to this one to pick up the chocolate aroma. Once you got it next to your mouth, the chocolate was coming right at you. The first sip was very big and full, almost creamy. The chocolate taste was balanced with the beer itself. I did wish, however, that the ABV would be somewhat higher so I could also enjoy the stout itself.

Not much as far carbonation and not big like other stouts. Great dessert beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,Bigc3031,4.4,"I am a fan of Rogue's line up, they never dissappoint.  I find that many beers need to warm up a bit when you pull them out of the fridge and this beer is no exception. Once the beer warmed the chocolate aroma and flavor jumped out. I raised my score on the second glass due to this fact. Great head retention and I can't stop smelling this beer. I think the one thing that kept this from getting a 5 in taste is that it doesn't taste enough like good chocolate but more like Nestle's cocoa powder. I don't want to steer people away from this beer at all with this last comment, it is very tasty.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,liquidsunshine,4.15,"Acquired a single from my local liquor store, Big C's. Poured into a tall weizen glass the color is dark black/brown with a finger of bubbly tan head. The smell hints towards the beers flavour, with a presence of roasty malt and chocolate. The taste is excellent, with a development of character through slightly more bitter cocoa to a gently sweet chocolate. Malt backbone melds well with the chocolate, and counteracts the bitter flavour. Rich and filling, with a nice rolling carbonation the mouth feel like the taste is excellent. I Would not want to drink too many of these in one sitting, although it is not particularly undrinkable.  Overall another high quality beer from a great brewery, and an excellent example of one of my favourite styles.  Cheers - Matt",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

T: Very Chocolaty which is nice at first, but as I continue to drink can make the beer a little to sweet, but i still truly enjoy it.

132,1118,mckeowbc,4.11,"A -Black like a stout should be. Good amount of foamy caramel colored head, that stuck around for a while. Left a fair amount of lacing on the side of the glass. S - Smell is slightly sweet with the unmistakable scent of Hershey's chocolate syrup. T - Taste starts slightly bitter, then the flavor of Hershey's syrup hits about midpoint on my tongue. After I swallow I'm left with a pleasant bitter/sweet flavor hanging on the back of my tongue. M - Mouthfeel is heavy, and the carbonation is noticeable. Not creamy like an Irish stout. I think I might have preferred if it was more creamy like Guinness, I think it would have complimented the chocolate milk like flavor. D - Overall very drinkable. A heavy beer, but not very alcoholic, well balanced flavors although the taste of Hershey's syrup might wear on me after a while.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,fdw3,4.5,"A - Pours a deep black with a thick brown head that slowly fades into a very nice cap.  S - Is delicious an aroma? Strong notes of dark chocolate and roasted coffee fading into a robust malt character.  T - Tastes of chocolate hit first, but fade to roasted flavors with a finishing sweetness. Malt presence is strong throughout and the alcohol is masked quite well.  M - Low-moderate carbonation with a thick, syrupy quality.  Overall: A very good beer in one of my favorite styles.

A nice tan creamy head maintains well and leaves interrupted webs of lace down the glass.  Smell: Very chocolately, with roasted malt as support. Soft aroma overall, except the chocolate, with even softer earthy hop notes.  Taste: Dark chocolate starts and works well with the roasted malt. Some light bitterness exists at the edge of the malt flavor and there is a smokey quality there as well. Muted earthy hops help to smooth it out. The light level of hops work well with the unsweetened taste and  Mouthfeel: Creamy, with enough carbonation to maintain the head. Slightly sticky. Medium to full body.  Drinkability: Solid overall, this is a pretty good chocolate stout and worth coming back to.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,jsanford,4.15,"22oz bottle poured into a Pint Glass  A - Pours dark black with a 1 inch mocha-colored head that dissipates quickly to a thin ring and haze. Leaves some sticky lacing. S - Sweet chocolate, dark roasted malt, and coffee beans. T - I'm surprised by this, I expected it to be much sweeter then it actually is. Granted, I get a lot of sweet chocolate, but there's a good amount of roasty malt, coffee, and a bit of smokiness present that really smooths and balances this one out, along with a pleasant hop bitterness. Really nice. M - Very smooth, with a medium-heavy body and pleasant ""tingly"" carbonation. D - Surprisingly great drinkability. I really expected this to be overly sweet, but it's a very well-balanced beer that goes down easily and has a good amount of depth. Kudos to Rogue!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,thagr81us,4.03,"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured pitch black with a four finger tan head that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, milk chocolate, and Yoo-Hoo. The flavor was of sweet malt, chocolate, and Yoo-Hoo. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I loved Yoo-Hoo as a child and this brough back some feel-good memories while drinking it. With that, it could be a little more complex, but this was very easy to drink. Might be a good way to get people into craft brew that enjoy Yoo-Hoo or chocolate for that matter. A must try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Spider889,4.13,"This was an exceptional find at my local Giant Eagle. And a fantastic value at that! People bitch and moan about Rogue prices but at $5.99 a bomber you're hard pressed to find a cheaper beer in the same format.  The bottle was a bit of a gusher - I was trying to get a decent head (after having to work pretty hard on recent stouts) and the head overflowed over my glass. Once it calmed down I was left with a very tall frothy head with substantial volume to it. Excellent retention and an awesome web of lace was left behind.  Smelled very sweet as one would imagine. Smooth Hershey syrup is the primary aroma. Some oats peak out around the edges along with roasted hazelnut coffee.  The taste was great. Lots of hop bitterness was present to balance out the sweetness. Also some baker's chocolate, coffee, and sweet milk chocolate.  Mouthfeel has a nice initial bite of carbonation, but finishes smooth (bordering flat) despite the head. Drinkability is good. I liked this beer, the price is right, I would certainly buy it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Massive tan head that dissipates slowly, leaving behind very nice lacing along the glass. Aroma hits the spot, a perfect blend of chocolate, dark roasted coffee/malts, and some more chocolate. Taste-wise, this is probably one of the best chocolate stouts I have had. Bitter chocolate mixed with hints of sweetness and a perfect bitter finish and aftertaste...'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, called Rogue Chocolate Stout... :-) Medium to full bodied, this is one yummy stout. The perfect taste makes it highly drinkable. Definitely among my top favorite stouts. Another classic beer from Rogue. Highly recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,broken22,4.3,Rogue Brewery is really good. I like many of their beers and this one is no exception. American Stouts are my favorite. Lets pop it open and pour a glass shall we.  This beer is nice and dark. During the pour a thick tan head forms and tries to make a seal to keep you from this goodness. What I'm getting at is the head did linger for some time before finally dying down to a more manageable level. I take my first sip or big gulp and smile. This beer has great flavor and it is even chocolaty like the label says. Smelling this beer I'm greeted with a nice sweet smell. Hard to really describe in more detail as its kind of unique for me. Since this beer is dark I would imagine most people would expect a thick beer. This beer is actually surprisingly light on the mouth.  So in conclusion I really like this beer. It's just one of those great tasting beers. The flavor reminds me a little of Maui Brewing Company's Coconut Porter. So if you love dark beers but don't want something heavy and just tastes great pick one of these up. My local stores here in San Diego are selling 22oz bottles for $5.99,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,alcstradamus,3.61,"Pours black with a two finger thick mocha head  Aroma is dry, dark chocolate. Some citrusy yeast notes.  The flavor cocoa powder and citrus hops. Not much more.

Not a great one, but worthy of some praise.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S: Strong scents of chocolates and roasted malts (to be expected). Also has slight hints of hops, which are really covered up by the chocolate but they are subtle.  T: The taste is very similar to the smell, has massive roasted malt flavors followed up by the subtle chocolate feel. There seems to be very little hop presence in this beer. The finish has some chocolates but is mostly a smoky finish.  M: Medium/thick bodied with tingly carbonation. Very creamy and smooth.  D: This beer is thick, creamy and very smooth. With the lower ABV I could drink this beer all day. The chocolate is nicely balanced with the malts and makes this a very delicious drink.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,birderbeerer,3.62,"Pours dark black with very little head.  Smells of chocolate/cocoa and mild otherwise. Very exciting aroma. A very distinct and mellow chocolate nose.  Taste is all cocoa, no chocolate. Some roast in the back. The dryness of the cocoa dominates this beer. Each sip seems to evaporate in my mouth. Despite the aroma there's really no sweetness to the beer.  You have to like cocoa to like this beer. The taste took me back at first, but I grew to it as I went along. It is a unique beer in its single-minded focus on cocoa.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Chaney,4.52,"This is a fascinating beer. I saw a documentary on how they made this one: I guess it's basically the Shakespeare Stout with added imported Belgian chocolate (very expensive I might add).  I split this bomber with my wife tonight. Thank goodness she loves chocolate!  A: Poured a very dark, melted truffle brown, with about a one finger beige head that retained itself for long after... hours after even. You see, my wife got full and never told me she didn't finish her portion. That friggin' head was still alive and kicking!  S: Straight up high grade chocolate, with quite a bit of a doughy quality that was very reminiscent of a chocolate donut. I didn't detect any booze... as a matter of fact, it almost didn't even smell like a beer at all.  T: Not a trace of coffee, fruit, or hop bitterness. All of the bitter elements were the ones provided by the chocolate. This was a very dark, dessert of a beer that was very disciplined in its approach.  M: Very milky in texture, almost like Nestle's Quick, only ten times better. The prickly carbonation aided in cutting through some of the dessert, and the sugar content was just sweet enough to give the cocoa a little kick.  D: At 6%, this was very drinkable. Rogue is really hit-or-miss with me, but their pac man yeast worked like a charm here!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,wrb357,4.72,"Poured from a 22oz into a pint glass.  There's no way around it: Rogue Chocolate Stout is chocolate in a glass. It looks like really thick chocolate syrup poured into a glass with some light carbonation addd. It smells of roasted malts and chocolate. It tastes like a stout and a porter had a baby. It's creamy, but has some decent carbonation. The tast is very rich and malty, and at first you don't get the chocolate. But then that chocolate backbone hits you and immediately you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. The taste lingers too, so you enjoy it even more as time goes on.  This is a heavy beer, but the flavor is so pleasing that it's very easy to drink. You really forget that you're drinking beer. After all 22oz are done you feel warmed and relaxed, like having a mug of cocoa, only this is beer, so you're sort of drunk. Easily one of my top stouts.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Milk chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, roasted mocha.  T. Chocolaty goodness. Sweet, caramelized sugars, very little alcohol burn (which makes sense at 6%). There's some coffee-bean bitterness on the finish but it is extremely mellow.  M. Smooth, sweet, coats the palate. Great mouth feel. It does have relatively strong carbonation, but it is not overwhelming. Creamy without being syrupy.  D. Highly drinkable.

Aroma: Sweet and dark with strong coffee and dark chocolate notes. Mild oiliness and milk flavors complete the nose.  Flavor: Huge chocolate taste, but without huge body. Bitterness comes from both dark chocolate and fresh hops. Smoke and coffee notes follow the bitterness to round out the beer.  Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy body but doesn't have overwhelming sweetness or thickness to make this an extremely enjoyable and drinkable beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,PeprSprYoFace,3.91,Can't believe I never reviewed this beer before.  Pours a deep black. Nice tan head with great lacing. Good lookin stout.  Aroma is it's downfall. Not very chocolaty. Very roasty and some tobacco.  Tastes great. Alot more chocolate than the aroma would suggest. Kind of a nestle quick sort of chocolate but more chocolaty than most beers that claim to contain chocolate. Nice roastyness to counteract and a decent sweetness.  Mouthfeel is a little thin but not bad. Wish it had a little more viscosity. Great carb.  Overall a great beer but I don't know if it is really top 100 quality. But good and everyone should check it out.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Shrews629,4.83,"Appearance - Extremely dark brown/black color. Extremely opaque. Just a small thin showing of ruby at the very bottom. A very creamy tan/brown/khaki colored head that has great lacing and retention. Poured thick. Looks tremendous. The lacing was the best I've ever seen.  Smell - Smells of roasted chocolate, cocoa and whole milk. Very well balanced. Pleasant on the nose. Not overly sweet, but almost perfect. The roasted barley comes through as a nice balancing act to tame the chocolate a bit.  Taste - Taste presents a wonderful flood of roasted, sweet chocolate. Some bitter tinges at the back end and on the sides of the tongue. The chocolate tastes more like cocoa, chocolate milk or a liquid chocolate candy bar. The bitterness starts to fade after each sip. Amazing!!!! I loved the taste!!!!  Mouthfeel - Medium to full mouthfeel. Smooth, dry and good. Coats the palate exceptionally. Only got a very small, tiny bit of ""chalkiness"", but nothing to deter the taste or feel of the this beer. This brew is filling and comforting.  Drinkability - This beer is truly outstanding. this is the best ""all around"" beer I've ever had in my life. There could be better ones out there, but as for right now, this has no competition in my eye. Easily drinkable. I would love to have a keg of this set up in my house. I may have just found my new favorite. Without a doubt, worth a try. I took my time drinking this because I didn't want to finish. I didn't want it to end. I could talk about this beer all day.

I thought that maybe it was me, and maybe I got a bad bottle, but 2 of my other friends had it also. One in Colorado, and One in Ohio, both had the same reaction. In my opinion this beer is way overrated.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A khaki to light brown head that is huge, 2 to 3 fingers tall develops and then very slowly turns into a gorgeous thick cap.  S - CHOCOLATE!!! God this smells delish. Almost smells like a liquid half Hershey Milk Chocolate bar and half Hershey Special Dark with a nice malty background. Lots of roasted notes and some light coffee notes coming through as well.  T - Tastes of sweet chocolate, oats, and maple. A very awesome roasted malty backbone holds this beer up and really smooths things out. Almost no alcohol is present at all which makes this beer even more awesome.  M - Very syrupy in the mouth. Dense and thick. A perfect sipper at the end of the night. Has a good amount of carbonation as well.  D - Highly drinkable! This is one to drink fresh over and over. Not sure cellaring would do this beer any good as the ABV is low and the chocolate would probably just dissapear.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Roasted and burned malts up front, with chocolate in the middle and some slight floral hops on the back end. Pretty tasty.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is slightly over medium bodied and pretty smooth drinking. This is one of my favorite Rogue beers.

S: Very dark chocolate, roasted chocolate malts, a little burnt coffee, roasted oats, a little sweetness (not quite caramel).  T: Right on with the nose, intense dark chocolate that has a burnt profile from the roasted malts, there's a little dark coffee. Smooth oats leads to more of a sweet milk chocolate flavor. Alcohol warms the slightest in the bittersweet finish, it's almost completely invisible.  M: Medium carbonation, medium body. While it's quite pleasant, I was expecting something a bit more viscous and full bodied.  D: I can't put the glass down, as a lover of dark chocolate and coffee, this one was hit out of the park.

Predominately taste milk chocolate with some coffee accents and a little bitterness.  M. Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Some lingering bitterness.  D. Very drinkable.

Smell: Smells just like a fine Belgian hot chocolate with a hint of roasted coffee. Slight alcohol as it warms.  Taste: Slight coffee bitterness at the begging then a huge wave of bittersweet chocolate comes through and takes over. The taste of chocolate just lingers on the palate. This is by far the most chocolaty beer I have had.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is full with medium carbonation. Smooth and silky as it gets.  Drinkability: Very High  What can I say?

One of the best smelling beers out there. Milk chocolate dominates (as opposed to the dark chocolate you usually get in these stouts). It's complimented by coffee, a light but distinct hoppiness, and a slight musty aroma. Outstanding.  T/M: Not as legendary as the aroma, but still very nice. The sweet milk chocolate still dominates, but this beer is far more bitter than I'd expect. It's a combination of roasted grain and hoppy bitterness. The sweet and bitter play together nicely at first, but the bitterness combined with the mouth coating end up being a bit much by the end of the bomber.  D: It's nice to find a stout with so much flavor and aroma that's this (relatively) low in ABV, but the bitterness and mouth coating make the last bit of the bomber somewhat difficult.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The brown head is comprised of small, tight bubbles and it is quite tall. Not really any lacing out of this one for some reason though.  The aroma has quite a bit of chocolate to it, matched with dark malt and some hops in the background.  Chocolate comes through immediately, and it is probably the strongest flavor in this beer. The chocolate flavors remind me more of dark chocolate than baker's chocolate, which is a nice touch. The chocolate gives way to dark malt, with some sweetness and some roasted flavors. The finish is better and has a fairly potent flavor of grapefruit from a liberal addition of American hops.  Pretty good mouthfeel, certainly no problems.

Pours a black ale with a hefty amount of beige foam which clings nicely to the side. Aroma has the nice chocolate scents some roasted malts, hot chocolate (with marshmellows) and slight orange whiffs. Great malty, chocolate, roasty taste. The cocoa taste really lingers and a little smoke is also produced afet the swallow. Good stuff. Agitate it a little on each sip to get some nice foam with each swallow. An adventure each time. Great drink on a cold day or around a campfire....or anytime.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Rumplemintz,4.64,"This was my first Stout experience. Wow just a good good beer. The chocolate was a pleasent suprise, not too overpowering, but the way this brewer incorporates the sweet with the dark and full flavor is amazing. It is a strong beer, but the chocolate and carmel hints make it a truely unique experience.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,IHC,4.85,"This is the way a chocolate stout should taste!!  The beer pours practically black and has a big head on the top of the beer, which fades slightly over time but remains throughout drinking. The chocolate taste is perfect, with a slight roasted taste coming through in the middle this beer balances the taste of chocolate with beer bitterness perfectly.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,alleykatking,4.32,Poured from 22oz bottle. Shared with Lukafer.  A- Pours a black color (go figure). Two finger light brown head shows good retention and ends up capping the beer. Light streaks of lacing on the sides of the glass.  S- Chocolate to the max! Tons of chocolate malts throughout the entire nose. Some light roasted malts pair off well with the chocolate malts giving off a iced coffee like nose. Some lighter sweet chocolate notes here and there in the background.  T- This beer delivers on the chocolate. Bitter chocolate in the front blends with a light sweeter milk chocolate like style. Some light roast in the middle of the beer. The ending of the beer has a mix of chocolate laced with warming alcohol. Light bitter hop bite in the tail end finishes up this beer nicely.  M- Medium-heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. Chocolate and roasted malts left on the palate. Chocoalte and warming alcohol left on the palate with a touch of bitter hops. Medium drying on the palate from the alcohol. Malty forward balance or lack thereof. Clean tasting throughout.  D- This was a nice drinking beer. I forgot how much I actually enjoy this beer...which is something I have a problem with at times with Rogue's beers. The ABV is well hidden until the stout warms up but that is expected. A great chocolate stout by this company!,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Lukafer,4.2,"Pours extremely dark brown/black with a thin, dark tan head.  Smells like cocoa, roasted malts, slight coffee.

132,1118,Phillie,4.1,"Served from a chilled 750 ml bomber poured into a snifter glass and enjoyed as it warmed closer to room temperature.  I love the designs of Rogue's bottles, very entertaining and unique.  This stout is dark! Almost like a black hole that destroys any light that should cross its path... The head looks like a milk chocolate wafer or something like an Aero chocolate bar. Simply mouth watering.  The smell does not disappoint!! For chocolate fans, this is as close to the real thing as it gets. Sticking my nose into the snifter yields fantastic notes of chocolate and roasted coffee with some malty undertones.  The taste was quite chocolately and coffee dominant when at a cold temperature. As the beverage warmed up during the sitting there existed a noticeable burn sensation on my tongue and surrounding mouth tissue. As the drink was close to room temperature the alcohol became much more noticeable but this wasn't a bad thing. The flavour became much more complex with the chocolate and roasted coffee complementing each other and becoming much more lively.  I enjoyed this beverage. I would definitely pick this one up again. Bravo Rogue!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ccampo,3.93,"Poured into a pint glass from a 22oz bottle.  A - Dark! You can't see through the glass. Very thick, brown head. Pretty!  S - Tootsie roll! Lots of characteristics here, but mostly chocolate and roasted coffee.  T - Bitter-sweet chocolate, with a nice roasted malty flavor. Pretty strong bodied.  M & D - Thick and heavy, and definitely gives a bitter sting. A little too carbonated for my taste in these types of beers. Fun to drink, but you can probably only drink one. I had this for desert, and I was thoroughly satisfied.  I would easily drink this again. Recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ratrod53,4.57,A- Very dark with slight red tent. Nice two fingered head that stayed for a while. No lace.  S- When you took a wiff it was a little like a cold chocolate cappichino. It was flavored with a rich dark chocolate.  T- The beer had some hops in it. It had a little coffee taste but the power taste was dark chocolate that was almost like a truffel.  M- Good carbination for this type of beer. It was a little heavy.  D- Very good beer if you want something that is a little different. Im not a big chocolate fan but I would have this beer again. My girlfriend loves this beer. So maybe she should have wrote this review.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Boitnott,4.25,"Bought as a reward for getting a lot of school work done in one day. I poured it from a bottle into a Bell's pint glass. The beer pours a beautiful dark brown, almost black color with some light brown red around the edges. The consistency appears thick and creamy. Hardly any head is apparent and it dissipates quickly, but has a light brown color, like chocolate milk which also stays with the moderate lacing as well.  The smell is of rich dark malts and some roasted malts as well. The light chocolate in the background makes the mouth water, and makes it next to impossible not to sip it before reviewing the smell! While delicate, but not overpowering, this leads to a light lingering smell.  Rich, dark malts dominate the nose, which only accentuates as you hold it in your mouth. The light chocolate comes through in the finish, but not enough to take over the dark malts. Surprisingly, the bitter hops mix well with dark chocolate flavors in the finish, which combine to form a nice and noticeably potent lingering flavor on the palate. The sweetness of the chocolate combines with the medium hops, which are more bitter than expected for a chocolate stout. A subtle hint of coffee flavors add to overall appeal of the finish. What sends this taste over the top is subtlety of the chocolate. It does not take over but only sits in the background for balance and mouthwatering flavor.  Tastes almost full-bodied but not enough to make you feel completely full. The relatively high carbonation balances helps to bring out the bitter hops and the subtle dark chocolate. Drinking this during dessert, would be the best option here. After a nice Christmas Eve dinner, this beer would go nice with some chocolate pecan pie. One beer would do the trick, and two if you really enjoy it. Great drink all around, and one of the best chocolates around.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RossCain,4,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass:  A: Poured dark black with milky consistency and a thick, light brown head. The head began with great retention and then settled with about a 1/4"" head. Decent lacing began to settle in on the sides of the glass throughout the session.  S: Chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. Mostly the bittersweet kind. Upfront, the smell was attractive, sweet, and faded into a slightly bitter/inviting coffee like aroma.  T: Sweet, milky and robust upfront. You can definitely pick up upon the strong notes of chocolate malts/flavoring and minor notes of roasted coffee during the initial part of the sip. As the beer continues to move down your palate, it fades into a more smokey sweet after-taste combining roasted oats with bitter sweet chocolate. The very slight hop characteristic shares a minor undertone in the finish which accentuates the lingering taste of the aforementioned bittersweet.  M: Thick, rich, and creamy. A desirable amount of light carbonation is present alongside a medium-full body which fades into a finish that coasts the palate long after drinking.  D: Drinkable during the course of the beer, yes. However, 22 oz was more than enough. The beer itself is very robust and flavorful but more towards the middle through the end the bittersweet characteristic really starts to take its toll.  Overall, the Rogue Chocolate Stout is an exceptional beer in my opinion that is more than worth a try. If you love rich, chocolaty stouts, this will be a staple in your book. However, from my personal experience, I recommend either pairing this beer with an equally robust meal or finishing one off as a dessert at the end of the night; you will find the bittersweet finish turning your palate off to anything else of an equally rich variety.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,heebes,4.27,"1 pint bottle  Pours black with a tan head which dissipates rather quickly. The nose is chocolate mostly with faint auromas of roasted malt and oat.

Easy on the palatte and certainly drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Excellent stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Chincino,4.42,I am currently drinking a Rogue Chocolate stout. It poured to be a very dark brown you could almost say black color with a half-inch tan color head.

132,1118,ChadQuest,3.2,"A overpowering strong chocolate impression that doesnt go the route of cloying sweetness and surupy, cool. This happens by using a more roasted coco powder format then a nestle sweet style like Choklat and other personally offensive beers. So take roasted oat flavors and light hoppy brightness and use it to tame cut through the sweetness, this is the lesson other brewers need to learn too.  A decent bomber to pick up to try, it's enjoyable.  Chad",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,depechemode1983,4.32,Pitch black with a thick brown relentless head thats there to stay. Exceptional lacing. Smells like espresso with chocolate undertones. Like drinking cold dark coffee no sugar no cream. Bitter like 72% dark chocolate. It does have a little sweetness to it. Excellent mouthfeel. So smooth. Im now in love with this beer. One of the best American Stouts Ive had in awhile.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,HURTemHIZZY,4.23,"Awesome brew. Pours a very deep brown with a medium to dark tan head. Lacing leaves a bit to be desired. Smell is intense chocolate. Not like the typical dark and bittersweet chocolate. Those are there, but the star is big milk chocolate, sweet and rich.  Taste is also big time milk chocolate. Deliciously sweet, not over the top or cloying at all. There's also a bit of coffee to offset the sweetness a bit. No noticeable hops, completely hidden 69 ibu. Nice medium creamy mouthfeel. Touch of carbonation. This is delicious.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DefenCorps,4.25,"I grabbed this at State Line a couple of weeks back. This is the first beer I've had in about 4 days, thanks to a sickeningly awful cold, but hey, if I'm good enough to function, I'm good enough to drink, right?  Rogue was one of the first breweries I got into as a n00b, and their marketing did play a big part in my choices. In the past couple of years, apart from the infrequent glass at a bar, I haven't had too many beers from them, and I'm now going to attempt to work my way through their catalog.  Chocolate Stout pours, as expected, black with a very dark brown head with great retention and nice lacing. The nose is excellent in so many ways. Up front, I get some aggressive roasted malt character, almost bordering on a burnt grain aroma, but a brief swirl brings out a decadent blend of chocolate and oatmeal. That combination is so intense, it's almost like a cookie, and the moderate fruitiness further amplifies that comparison. The chocolate isn't particularly dark or intense, rather milk chocolate like, and has a sweetened cocoa character. Hops? absent for all intents and purposes. Excellent stuff.  The palate opens with an intense cocoa character, very Hershey's cocoa like with a noticeable undercurrent of sweetness. The level of cocoa here is pretty darned perfect, balancing beautifully the roasted malt character that comes through on the mid-palate. Not as fruity as the nose would suggest, though there's just a touch of raisin present here. The oatmeal does present a little smoothness on the mid-palate, but the carbonation does take away a little bit from that aspect. Sweetness is almost entirely cocoa-derived without a noticeable caramel or brown sugar component present. The finish is quite excellent with flavors of burnt grain, cocoa and a little sweetness. However, there's also just a touch of a nut-like bitterness present. The other aspects of the mouthfeel are excellent too. Medium in body with a rather smooth, silky feel, the carbonation is a little high for my liking. Drinkability is definitely up there, by keeping the sweetness and alcohol low, this is almost as drinkable as water. I've drunk half my bomber in about 10 minutes. Excellent stuff, I'd LOVE to try this on cask.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BeerdedEric,3.8,"Appearance: a dark brown very foamy head. Kind of looks like a cappuccino. Beer is black, makes sense for a chocolate stout.  Aroma: smells almost exactly like milk chocolate and coffee. Smells very sweet. Chocolate is very pronounce.  Mouth feel: light in carbonation and quite smooth for a stout. When I swish it around seems to thicken up a bit.  Taste: tastes like a chocolate cappuccino with a beer flavor. Leaves a very pronounced after taste of a coffee-like flavor. When I breathe out heavily through my nose I taste more of the chocolate taste, quite interesting.  Drink ability: its good but I think 22 ounces is enough for this type of beer.  At the very end of the beer you can see tiny specs of chocolate, not a whole lot but enough to notice. It does add a few points for me in the appearance column.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,Beerandraiderfan,4.5,"Well nice and dark, not super thick, viscosity not over the top, back to what stouts used to look like, traditional. Aroma, well, chocolate was preeminent.  Taste, whoo, chocolate is massive, its really the only definable taste. I can't help but notice I wished the viscosity was higher on this, I did think to myself it was a little thin, maybe I'm just caught up in the massive beer trend, but this one, while having an immense chocolate feel, it didn't seem to have anything to balance itself out. Plenty more of these to check out along the way to see if it evolves into something that is better with even more legs under it.  EDIT: Having drank about a dozen more of these since the initial review, I can really say I actually have come to appreciate this being a more reasonable stout, i.e. not being massive, but allowing the chocolate delivery vehicle to be right where it need be. Can't beat this stuff at $6 a bottle, one of my frequent/almost always purchases when I go to a store that has this stuff in stock.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

There is an incredibly tantalizing chocolate aroma that surges out of this brew coupled with a subtle coffee smell.  The unsweetened chocolate takes control of the almost roasty flavor. It has a bitterness to it that is very well complemented by the chocolaty flavor. There are some subtle coffee flavors that are pretty minor in comparison to the chocolate goodness.  It is thick and creamy, but has a little more carbonation than I prefer. Leaves a nice aftertaste in your mouth after every sip.

Taste- More of a dark chocolate then milk, little coffee, roasted malts, a little bit bitter but still tastes really good.  Mouthfeel- This is a smooth creamy medium bodied beer.  Drinkabilty- I would say anyone could drink this beer, the sweetness may only allow some to drink a single serving of it but on taste alone, you would want to drink alot more.  Overall This is one of my all time favorite beers I have said before in other reviews that Rogue is one of my favorite brewers out there and this is one, if not their best.

A slightly bittersweet chocolate taste in the front with a sweeter chocolate note along with nice finish. I get a little hops in the middle but chocolate dominates this beer through and through.  Mouthfeel- Slight carbonation on the tongue but much lighter than you would expect from something of this color. It's a very creamy mouthfeel.  Drinkability- For a stout it's fairly high. I will not have a problem knocking out this bomber.  Overall- An outstanding stout and a great example of what a Chocolate Stout can be. Rogue's Chocolate Stout is easily one of my favorite chocolate stouts and I purchase this beer on a regular basis because it works well as a dessert beer or with a meal or after a long day.

Good looking beer.  Smell: dark roasted malt in the background but the nose is first and foremost the smell of bittersweet chocolate. The only thing I've had that is more chocolatey in the nose is Southern Tier's Choklat.  Taste: roasted malt and some hop bitterness are there but again like the nose, its mostly all chocolate all the time. As it warms up you notice more of the grain and the chocolate becomes less bitter and more sweet. Very good.  Feel: not much carbonation so its very smooth. Medium bodied.  Drink: very high. Its easy to drink and since its only 6% you could session this with no problem.  Overall, its very good. The ""made with natural chocolate flavoring"" worries me a bit.

Taste: A very complex and inviting taste, with almost no noticeable turn offs. A great burst of sweetness is brought first. After, a nice blend of spiciness from the 68 IBU's comes forth. A sweet, robust chocolate taste is found and the end and lingers nicely after.  Mouthfeel: All the flavors are spread nicely throughout the mouth and make for a pleasant aftertaste. The chocolate seems to be almost more noticeable and appreciated in the aftertaste.  Drinkability: The flavor of alcohol is simply not present, and therefor becomes easy drinking.

The bitterness is enough to clean the palate. Low carbonation.  D: Fairly high for me, which was unexpected. This would be quite good with a desert, especially (albeit, a little obvious) of the chocolate variety.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,haazer,3.93,"Poured a bomber into my pint glass.  A- Motor oil black, thick pour. Chocolate and tan head that is very compressed with thousands upon thousands of bubbles. Almost 3 fingers worth of head. Leaves a little bit of lacing down the glass.  S- Smells of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. Slight hint of mint.  T- Burnt coffee beans up front. Big malty backbone that finishes the flavor. Chocolate? Chocolate, eh, maybe more in the smell then in the taste IMO. Still a good tasting stout but I was expecting more of a chocolate taste.  M- Good amount of carbonation, medium bodied. Fairly smooth. Low abv doesnt dry mouth out which is good.  D- Pretty drinkable, not overly thick, refreshing and good amount of carbonation. I've had better stouts. I've also had Rogue chipotle ale which I thought represented a ""heat"" taste more so than this ""chocolate"" stout. A good stout don't get me wrong, I just wish the chocolate was more evident.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

T: the taste also had a nice rich creamy chocolate flavor alongside oat grain accents slight toastiness but it did seemed to have a very mild hop bitter bite and a good sweet malt balance.  M: the brew was full in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, slight grainy, but smooth, and creamy finish.

The head has tremendous retention and lacing.  S: Lots of chocolate on the nose. Perhaps more than in any other beer I've had. Although, this is to be somewhat expected as this is one of the first purely ""chocolate"" stouts that I have had.  T: Bitter chocolate up front is the defining characteristic of this beer for me, but the most surprising feature is the hoppiness at the finish. Actually, as this beer warms, the bitter finish becomes much more prominent than the chocolate. I was a little disappointed with the taste of this after the great smell.  M: Probably the weakest point of this beer in my opinion. Very thin and not much left on the tongue after each sip. This also has a bit too much carbonation for me.  D: This beer goes down easy enough, but is not very substantive and lacks complexity.

Smells of chocolate and malt - very pleasing to the nose, it almost reminds me of hot cocoa. The flavor, of course, is noticeably chocolate, however it is not overwhelming and is extremely pleasant. The chocolate seems to be in near perfect balance with the malt flavor. It is slightly sweet, but it adds to the chocolate and makes it an extremely flavorful and delicious brew.

132,1118,tewaris,4.31,"Rogue Chocolate Stout Rogue Ales American Stout OG? 69 IBUs 22 oz bomber with no freshness date poured into a New Belgium snifter.  Appearance 5/5 Clear, viscous (see mouthfeel) looking dark brown, almost black while pouring; darker than the usual stouts, and more closer to an Imperial Stout. Big dark tan color creamy head that has a good retention and an equally good lacing. Very good looking beer.  Aroma 4/5 Bitter, dark chocolate, and some malty sweetness.  Taste 4/5 Hard to separate it from aroma but overall very flavorful. Nice dark chocolate taste until a medium dry finish and a lingering dark chocolate aftertaste. The chocolate is very ""unsweetened"", and so the bitterness is very clean. Therefore it's hard to say what part of it is coming from hops. In my opinion this beer will benefit from more malty sweetness, of which I get practically none. Also, can't really say that it has a decent amount of roast to it. Still, very good!  Mouthfeel 4.5/5 Smooth with medium-high carbonation. Medium body, a tiny bit thin but not watery by any means. Like I have remarked in the taste section, some sweetness and a bigger body will help make this beer a delicious dessert. I said in the Appearance section that it looks viscous; it's not though.

I must admit, I was expecting a sweeter chocolate than what was offered. The chocolate has a distinct bitterness to it that works very well. The more you drink this stout, the more the bitterness turns to a semi-sweet chocolate.  M: Minimal carbonation in this medium plus bodied stout. No worries as the chewiness of this desert stout pleases the mouth.  D: This is a VERY drinkable stout! The initial bitterness fades away as you drink and semi-sweet chocolate is a wonderful parting gift. A very enjoyable stout indeed! The best chocolate stout hands down.

The mouthfeel is a lot thinner than it looks/smells. I expected this to be much thicker consistency with a lot less carbonation. This is where this beer falls off for my tastes. I would have loved this stout to be a little bit sweeter and more body to it. Although it wasn't as heavy as I would have liked it, it proves to be a much more drinkable stout than one would expect.

S-This is a stout in all respects, but it is very definitely chocolate. Chocolate and roasted hazelnuts, but so much more. This is like the best chocolate milkshake imaginable since it is beer.  T-This is without question chocolate first, then stout. This is so amazingly rich that it is difficult to believe the ABV is only a modest 6% ABV. Rich chocolate with a nutty essence and hints of coffee. Very well done, Rogue.  M-Very smooth with a balanced complexion. It is surprisingly good, and usually associated with much bigger beers. This is close to delectable.  D-A very good American Stout, all the more so since the velvety smooth chocolate give this beer its character.

The beer itself is pitch black in color, and as you sip this beer, it leaves a very nice lacing behind in the glass. This is one of the best looking beers Ive ever seen.  S - I am getting a slightly roasted smell, followed by the chocolate. Overall it smells very good, theres not a huge chocolate aroma like I was expecting but the chocolate is definitely present.  T - Wow, this beer has a VERY nice chocolate taste, but not in a gimmicky way, like some of the other chocolate stouts Ive had. When I think of A chocolate stout this is how I picture it tasting. Besides the chocolate taste, it also has a roasted quality to it, plus a tasty hop bitterness at the end. The chocolate flavor is great, but more importantly its balanced perfectly with the hop bitterness, and roasted flavors.  M - This beer has a very thick mouth feel, and it goes down nice and smooth. I enjoy beers that tend to have a nice full body like this one.  D - Personally I think the beer is highly drinkable, just because it taste so great. It may have a full body, and be a dessert beer, but I can see myself drinking 4 of these bottles in one sitting. Sure I would probably pass out in a drunken mess, and have nightmares of chocolate bars with arms and legs, beating my ass with Rogue Chocolate Stout bottles, but in the end its all worth it for the delicious choc-a-riffic taste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A nice frothy tan head emerges from the brew with incredible head retention and leaves copious amounts of stringy lacing all over the glass. Very impressive. The nose is predominantly hit with huge waves of cocoa powder and chocolate syrup. All of the Cascade hops seem to have been completely overpowered in aroma.  How does a 3-year old bottle of Chocolate Stout taste? Let's find out..  Niiice. A nice shallow hop bite at first, but eases into this incredibly smooth and bready chocolate goodness. The cocoa powder on top makes this very reminiscent of NesQuik, my preferred drink as a kid. Surprised to find that there's still an boozy characteristic towards the end, even after all that aging. Still very appeasing overall.  Mouthfeel is more light-bodied and carbonated than I would have liked, but still goes down smoothly. Drinkability is probably higher than what it would be at its genesis in 2007. The hop bitterness is unnoticeable and the amplified chocolate and cocoa makes for a beautiful smoothness. Definitely dispelled all my apprehension about buying this bottle, especially due to its brewing year, but now I'm glad to have been proven wrong.

At first, its a sweet chocolate, but finishes more with a bitter dark chocolate flavor.  Mouthfeel is lighter than expected in the body, but very smooth and creamy. Overall a top notch American Stout.

132,1118,sellmeagod,3.35,"Ah, the chocolate stout. The classic dilemma of whether to go with the beer or just stick to an average chocolate bar and a shot of liquor.  But Rogue, obviously, doesn't think that this should be the case and instead provides an excellent alternative, if a bit safe.  Sure the chocolate smells, tastes, feel, and look are all over, but when it tastes like a thick stout with the texture of chocolate you don't hardly mind that this is such a weak (6.0) abv.

132,1118,mtcarr88,4.55,"22 oz bomber poured into standard pint glass.  This is a beautiful looking beer, dark and robust with a wonderful tan/brown head. The beer pours smooth, and look wonderful as it exits the bottle, almost a molasses type of look as the liquid is poured into the glass.  The first note on the smell is chocolate, a bitter dark chocolate, in vein of a baker's chocolate. It hits your nose immediately, and you can tell this is a real chocolate stout, there aren't chocolate notes, it's pure real chocolate in your nose. I also could smell a faint citrus of hops, and even some mocha style coffee in the nose as well. A fantastic smelling beer.  Once this beer hits your tongue the chocolate hits you right in the face, it's like the woman on the label served you this beer freshly and once the liquid hits your tongue she clinches a bar of chocolate and punches you in the face. A dark, bitter, chocolate is extremely apparent, also mixing with slight coffee roastyness, and I even got a little toffee upfront. The back of this beer is what really separates it, and that's the undeniable bitterness. This stout has 69 IBU's and for a reason, it perfectly balances out that sweet hit in the face at the front of the mouth, with an amazing hop bitterness at the back. Very slight citrus, piney-like hops were tasted at the finish. What a perfect way to end a tasty brew.  Chocolate upfront and hops in the back, and then the chocolate lingers on in your mouth, begging you to drink even more. The mouthfeel is exceptional, I would have liked a bit more bitterness at the back, but this is still a great balance, it's not overly sweet, but not overly bitter at the same time. Carbonation is very mild, and you can be generous with your sips, but I don't think you'd want to, as this beer is meant to be savored.  Drinkability is fairly high, the addictive taste and hop bitterness leaves you begging for more as I said, but it is apparent how heavy this beer can be, so a 22 oz bomber is perfect for me in one sitting.  There aren't too many horrible things I can say about this beer, it still remains one of my favorite stouts I have tried so far, and one of my favorite beers I have tried in my short life. The only real compliant I would have is the price, it's about 6 bucks where I live for a 22 oz bomber, however I do admit it IS worth the price in taste, but my wallet can't take much more!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Naugros,4.07,"All the typical markers for a stout great you as you pour this...dark body and a thick head. But the head on this beer is one of the darkest I've seen showing as truly tan approaching brown.  There is quite a lot of chocolate in the nose along with a bit of toast and even a hint of coffee behind it all. This is the most chocolate I've ever smelled in any chocolate stout. Perhaps that's because they use ""natural chocolate flavoring"" in it.  Again, there's more chocolate in this than most, but then again most ""chocolate"" stouts are referring the roast level of the malts used. This one actually refers to chocolate. The flavoring is ""natural"" but the taste doesn't come off as such. It actually reminds me of chocolate Twizzlers. It almost seems ""plastic"", if that makes any sense. However, there's also a well-crafted stout behind the additives. You can sense the roasted barley and feel the hops adding some bitterness even after the bitterness created by drinking a stout too cold abates.  For some reason I wanted this to thicker, maybe because I figured the rolled oats would lend some viscosity. It seems a bit thin to me. There's no real aftertaste and that's a positive.  Easily quaffable as long as you don't mind the chocolate flavor seeming a bit unnatural.

The body is an opaque black color with just a hint of brown showing through around the edges.  S - A rich aroma of chocolate, nutty malt, honey, and dark bread.  T - Bitter chocolate and Turkish coffee up front with a little bit of roasted nut character. Very dry in the middle with a slightly acrid, burnt flavor that seems to be equal parts roasted grain and hops. Finishes with more coffee, and dark bakers chocolate as well as a surprising note of pine hops.  M - Medium-thick body with a coco-butter slickness, moderate carbonation, and a dry finish.  D - Quite an interesting beer, the chocolate character is undeniable, but the lack of sweetness skews it toward nutty coffee in a way that I didn't expect. The mouthfeel stands out more that that of most beers, due mostly to the unique slickness that comes from the chocolate. The hops in the finish help keep the beer balanced and make the darker flavors stand out. A good beer overall, though I think it would benefit greatly from just a bit more residual sweetness.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ebby82,4.22,"Pours a light black into a snifter. Head is minimal. The smell is of roasted malt, with an abundance of cocoa. It smells like when you tour the Hershey's chocolate factory, or like really good hot chocolate. The taste is more understated than other chocolate stouts I've had. It is definitely chocolaty, but also malty with a hint of nuttiness. The mouth feel is medium bodied, and never too thick nor sweet. It is very drinkable.  Overall, I really like this beer, although Brooklyn's chocolate stout is still my favorite.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,punkrkr27,3.66,"Pours black with a nice two-finger, dense, tan head. Lots of rich dark chocolate aroma with just a hint of roasted malts.

Smells like dark chocolate. Fairly strong aroma, but very complex tho. Tastes like dark chocolate too, and again, lacks complexity. No roasted malt flavors to be found. At 69 IBUs this beer is surprisingly balanced however .Interesting mouthfeel, a bit heavy, but very smooth drinking. Big flavors, but not overwhelming.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Appearance: Black color with a large-ish brown head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves behind thick lace.  Smell: Sweet chocolate malt aqnd roasted notes with some sourness.  Taste: Begins with a roasty flavor, rounding out to chocolate sweetness and finishing even sweeter and more chocolatey with a coffee-like bitterness at the very end.  Mouthfeel: Medium to thick body with a bit too heavy carbonation and a dry finish.  Drinkability: Another very solid beer from Rogue/ Like most of Rogue's beers, this isn't a world-beating beer, but is still very enjoyable and at least worth a try. A nice dessert beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,Lintyfresh,4.43,"I had this a couple nights ago and lost my notes, thanks to a couple 90 minute IPAs.  A. The first thing that I noticed as I poured this into the snifter the bar provided was that it was difficult to see through even as it was coming out of the bottle. It was as black as dark chocolate with a hint of brown (although that may have been the lighting).  S. There was nothing remarkable in the smell except the chocolate coming through.  T. Chocolate. Chocolate malts. Chocolate candies. Chocolate bars. It started heavy on chocolate, had a slight bitterness to the middle, and finished strong dark chocolate. Too bitter for a buddy of mine, but the bitterness isn't what stands out.  M. I'm surprised at how light the body to this was after pouring it. I was expecting (and almost wanting) a much thicker beer, but alas this was medium bodied and smooth.  D. The drinkability is frightening.

132,1118,uustal,4.2,"Pours very dark with a brown head. Decent lacing and head retention throughout. Aroma is dominated by the scent of sweet chocolate. Big unsweetened chocolate malt flavor, some roasted notes. Nice touch of hops as well give the beer some balance and a little bitterness. Sweetness intensifies as you get further into the beer. Flavors aren't too intense like some chocolate stouts. Nice drinkability as well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,thetomG,3.73,"Very nice dark brown pour with gorgeous layer of tan head that lingers slightly but leaves very little lacing behind.  Smell is dark baking chocolate. Flavor is similar but tastes a bit more like chocolate milk/cocoa powder. Also just enough hoppy bitterness in the finish to balances out the sweetness.

I only had Pale Ales & IPAs in my fridge and I was filling something thicker. I went out to get this and it is really satisfying my palate right about now. Not the first or last time I will have this great beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,TheMadJack,4.03,"Poured from 22oz. bottle into Pint Glass.  A: Slick, oily brown whilst pouring becomes a beer black as sin in the glass. No light passes through, the head is coarsely foamy and sepia brown. Moderate lacing.  S: Heavy dark and unsweetened chocolate aroma. Hint of vanilla. Burnt coffee.  T: Dark chocolate front and center, unsweetened on the finish. Dark roasted coffee and tannins in between. Malts manifest as a barely detectable flavor of bran. The smell smacks you in the face as you drink. A straightforward and unapologetic approach to a chocolate stout. Bitterness lingers.  M: Weighty and almost oily. No unpleasant stickiness. The bitterness adds enough bite to prevent it being described as ""smooth"". This beer grabs your attention.  D: What this beer lacks in subtlety it makes up for in flavor. It's a decidedly stout-like two-chocolate punch that puts aside the traditional ""roasted"" and ""burnt"" flavors in favor of straight unsweetened chocolate bitterness. If you like chocolate, you can drink this. 22 ounces is a piece of cake, almost literally. If you really like chocolate, you could drink this all night. If you hate chocolate, don't even bother.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BBThunderbolt,3.7,"Poured into 10oz glass. Poured a solid black with a dark tan head that had decent retention and lacing. The aroma was strongly chocolate, with some roasted notes in the background. That's a fairly accurate summation of the flavors as well.  The body was a bit thinner than I like for the style, but was still decently full. Drinkability was pretty good, but this brew is kind of a one-trick pony and can get boring pretty quickly. Overall, a very decent beer, certainly worth a shot.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

I'd recommend trying this one for sure.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,HiGravShawn,4.3,"Nice dark brown to almost black. The nose has a little more coffee than the flavor provides. It doesn't give a strong bittersweet chocolate flavor, but a more mellow almost milk chocolate smooth flavor with just the right amount of bitterness. Both different and delicious.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,JeepCop,4.58,"22 oz bottle poured into a 2008 KU National Championship pint glass :)  A: The epitome of how a stout should look! It pours a jet black body with a 2+ finger head. The head is tan in color and it appears dense enough to walk on.  S: Chocolate is predominant in the nose with a hint of roasted coffee. Really looking forward to this stout!  T: As expected, Chocolate is the dominating force here. I must admit, I was expecting a sweeter chocolate than what was offered. The chocolate has a distinct bitterness to it that works very well. The more you drink this stout, the more the bitterness turns to a semi-sweet chocolate. This is most likely a product of your palate adjusting to the bitterness. The finish is dry and lingering.  M: Minimal carbonation in this medium bodied stout. I fear the low carbonation is from sitting on a shelf too long, so I will definitely needs a 2nd offering from another store to confirm.  D: This is a VERY drinkable stout! The initial bitterness fades away as you drink and semi-sweet chocolate is a wonderful parting gift. A very enjoyable stout indeed!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RickS95,4.28,"Best looking beer I've ever seen. Pitch black with a big time brown cloudy head.  Smells great; roasty notes of chocolate fill the olfactories, some licorice in the background as well as smoke.  Taste is a cross between chocolate and coffee.  Exceptional head retention. Feeling on the palate is complex. It's sweet, it's bitter, it's smooth.  Goes down easy with only moderate alcohol, very drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Taste and Mouth - chocolate is easily the most dominate flavor here. it has a nice roasty bitter finish. i personally like my stouts on the thicker side and this is thin for what i expected. carbonation is good for a stout.  Drinkability - very good i go back sip after sip. this is defintely a good dessert beer.  Notes - over all i really like this beer. i wish there was more of a thick, oatmeal type mouthfeel but thats just my personal preference when it comes to stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,deapokid,4.48,"Pours a chocolate bar black with buoyant tufts of creamy brown foam. The lacing is rather sticky and the head stays large and in charge even after it sits for a few minutes. This brew looks great, like a tempting rich dessert that you can't help but scarf down.  The chocolate aroma was creamy, sort of like Young's Double Chocolate, but with an added hint of vanilla and a slight cakey bitterness. Aromatically resembles a chocolate milk, which is a wonderful thing.  The flavor is like a wonderful collision of everything I love about dessert. Melted chocolate, vanilla, roasted coffee bean, pie crust, a hint of hops and Cheerios are all stuffed in, but it never feels like too much of a good thing. It's a delicious concoction that gets better as it warms.  One concerning aspect (at least to most of my beer drinking buddies) is the thinness of the liquid, which is rather unexpected. Personally, I don't think it's under-bodied, just light and fluffy.  This brew is an amazing journey from smooth chocolate to a bitter graininess, packing a low ABV for maximum consumption. This is Rogue's crowning achievement and an exemplary American stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,biggietattoos,3.98,"Rogue Chocolate kicked off my evening of beers and I was definitely pleased with my choice (as I usually am with Rogue)  Poured a nice deeeppp blackish brown with a minimal mocha colored head.  definitely gave off an aroma of cocoa, nutty, coffee notes, Not overly malty.  Definitely gives a nice hint of chocolate flavor also a little bit of a mocha coffee taste, slight bit of malts on the back end that quickly dissipates.  Nice and smooth mouthfeel. Not overly thick and syrupy very drinkable stout.  Definitely will pick this one up again",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Daktyls,4.25,"A: Pours a deep dark chocolate brown, with a finger and a half of head which is nice and foamy. A very thick foam which is nice and bubbly leaving a fine lacing on the side of the glass.  S: Let me just say, wow. This beer smells amazing. Smells like a very smooth chocolate with milky notes and a faint floral hoppiness. There is also a very slight note of coffee in the aroma.  T: To be honest, I was a little disappointed by the taste after being so delighted by the nose. The tastes are the same as the nose, but seemed to be a slightly watered down version of the aroma. Chocolate-y notes with again a floral hoppiness that is moderately apparent.  M: Feels good on the tongue, not overly smooth, medium to light carbonation.  D: Very drinkable, I will easily finish this bomber and then promptly wish I had another. As other reviewers have noted, this would probably make an excellent beer to combine with some ice cream to make a nice float.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,NightINgale,4.18,"22 US fl.oz. bomber bottle poured into a tulip pint glass...  A - Oustanding! Dark brown body, with small bubbles rising. An extremely rich fluffy brown head. Great head retention and lacing!  S - Very chocolatey on the nose. Sweet milk chocolate notes, some floral hop notes, and a solid roastiness. This is indeed one of the most chocolatey-smelling beers out there!  T - As much as the smell reminded me of sweet milk chocolate, the taste couldn't be further away from it. At first, bitter chocolate notes dominated, followed by a solid roastiness, with a touch of coffee. Some earthy hops were also present The finish was dry and fairly bitter, with just a hint of chocolate lingering on. After some time, I began noticing a little more sweetness appearing, which really boosted the drinkability for me.  M - Medium body to it; fairly crisply carbonated. Quite smooth; nicely coats your palate. No trace of alcohol.  D - This is a very drinkable stout. Definitely smoother and more drinker-friendly than a typical dry stout. The chocolate really makes a difference. If you are a fan of stout, you'll probably enjoy this a lot. This could even make a session stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BigTomZ,4.5,"Poured a nice black stout with a nice brown head.  This stout smells great. Cocoa, chocolate, roasted malts. I sat down to drink this, expecting to drink it alone. My wife (a wheat beer lover) smelled it decided to drink some with me. She never drinks stouts, but I guess that says a lot for the aroma of this beer.  The taste is very much like the nose. Great chocolate taste with roasted malts and a little coffee at the end.  I think the body is just right for a chocolate stout. Not too thin but not too rich with just enough carbonation.  The chocolate is more of a dark chocolate and not too sweet. I found that this added to the drinkability. I could have finished another bottle if I had another on hand.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smells of chocolate, sweet malt, slight hop, slight roasted malt, slight earthiness/wood, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of an American Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight hops, slight chocolate, hint of roasted malt, and slight citrus. Overall, a good blend and aroma, decent body.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Brenden,4.18,"The color is a very deep, dark brown, almost black, with brown highlights. A fat, dense head pours out and sits almost the entire time, sticking immediately and leaving some very nice thick patches and rings of lacing. The aroma is of heavily roasted malts and a chocolate presence that's more unsweetened baking chocolate than anything else. A very earthy aroma pulls through with some smokiness. Again, the chocolate is more of a bitter unsweetened baking chocolate, but there's a counterbalancing creamy sweetness in here as well. Huge roasted barley malts make up the backbone and a further balancing hops presence is plenty strong, yet still leaves the malts to dominate. A lingering finish is smoky and citric with a light bitterness. Maybe something's changed, but the chocolate presence doesn't blow me away and was not as strong as I would have liked. This is, however, an extremely tasty stout. The mouthfeel is big, chewy and robust in a full body with minimal carbonation and a velvety smoothness. Extremely tasty? Definitely. Extremely chocolaty? I'll try it again sometime to see if it was faded.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Kala1073,4.42,"One word for this beer is WOW!!! From the very first pour to the very last taste, this beer was just great! There is no doubt that this beer lives up to it's name. The first thing that wil hit you is the smell of chocolate(dark) right of the bat. There is also vanilla and malts present as well. As for the taste, it was delicious! The first thing you taste is of course trhe chocolate, but it is not sweet, it is more robust than anything. It quickly mellows off and you can taste the maltyness of this brew. It goes down silky smooth. I will be stocking up on this beer for the forseeable future.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mgbickel,4.25,"This was once one of my top stouts...times have changed over 10 years!  Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter. Split with my wife (as this was part of her Valentine's Day present!). The aggressive pour yielded a large, 2 finger, milk chocolate colored head. Some lacing present as the foam dissipated. The body is solid and black. I tried to force light through...not happening.  The nose is what you would expect from a chocolate stout...lots of cocoa aromas dominate. You can also pick up some roasted malts and a subtle, milky-cream aroma.  The flavors are right in line with the nose. Lots of chocolate and roasted malts. Hints of bitter coffee toward the finish. Really good flavor, but everything is a little on the weak/subdued side...  The mouth feel is on the thinner side (especially for a stout), slightly watery and moderately carbonated.  This is very drinkable. Like I mentioned above...was one of my favorites before I developed a taste for bigger, stronger stouts. I will always keep this in my cooler though!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Ragedman,4.25,"Pours a dark brown, nearly black. The bottle calls it an 'ebony'. For a chocolate stout I find it as dark as it should be.  Smells like chocolate, chocolate, and dark chocolate.  Taste is not quite as chocolate but still there is chocolate. Hops and some malts. 90% chocolate, 9% hops, and the 1% rest. A nice overall pleasing taste, tastes much like Deschutes Brewery Obsidian Stout.  Solid mouthfeel; perhaps just a tiny bit over carbonated but it must suffice and the mouthfeel is still great.  Nearly to easy to drink. Could easily finish off two bombers in an hour. This is a nice strong brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,missingsense,3.56,"Poured from bottled into Victorian pint glass. No freshness date.  A: Black with a thick mocha-colored head that doesn't budge for a while. Sturdy foam lacing plants itself to the side of the glass. I'm looking forward to this.  S: Milk chocolate & dark chocolate. First whiff does not smell like beer at all. I'm expecting to taste a milkshake. A cafe au lait aroma becomes evident as it warms.  T: A taste that develops itself for quite some time. Chocolate flavoring is obvious upfront, along with a roasted malt character. An initial touch of oats is present as well. The milk chocolate flavor turns to dark chocolate as it lingers on the taste buds. The hops slowly reveal themselves in the aftertaste with a faint tingling which grows to become a little more bitter than I would have expected. There's a bit of chalkiness, like powdered chocolate in the end, too. It's bitter-sweet, to be sure, but a little to much of each for my tastes.  M: Relatively thin mouthfeel for a stout, but a good amount of carbonation.  D: The addition of natural chocolate flavorings is a nice touch, but feels unnecessary. I do have a sweet tooth, but I can't imagine pairing this with a dessert (like the bottle suggests)... that would just be sweetness overload. This a beer best enjoyed by itself. I would actually be happy splitting the bomber with someone else. However, those that like very bold, assertive beers will be pleased.  Not my favorite stout, or Rogue beer for that matter, but I have deep respect for Rogue for always taking risks and being creative with their brews.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,July2Nov,4.25,"Appearance: Dark as the night with a small (1/2 inch) frothy head. Lacing clings to the rim and stays.  Smell: Bold & sweet. Licorice and toffee notes seem to pour out.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Slight sweetness hits you at first, then a ground coffee smack, mellows down into a chocolate mix and finishes with a chalky sweetness of what seems to be chocolate syrup.  Drinkability: The first thing I thought was, ""This would be great as a beer float!"". And, I still believe that to be true, however, as a stand alone beer, this one is one of the better chocolate stouts. Not sure if I would have drank the whole bomber by myself...but if i had that ice cream...watch out!

132,1118,billab914,4.1,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my brand new Bruery tulip glass. Poured black in color with a big thick tan head taking up 1/3 of the glass. The head settled down a bit and clung to the edges of the glass where it left some great lacing.  The aroma has a distinct milk chocolaty flavor to it. It has a bit of roasted bitterness to it but I keep coming back to that Hershey's chocolate milk like flavor it's giving off. For a beer labeled a chocolate stout it's pretty true to it's name in the aroma at least.  The taste shows the chocolate milkiness that was present in the nose but it has a bit of hop bitterness helping to balance it out a bit. The chocolate has a long lasting effect in the finish. It has a bit of roasty flavors as well but the milk chocolate really comes through more then anything else. It's relatively balanced for a chocolate beer between the sweet chocolate flavors and the bitter hop and roasty flavors.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice chocolate flavored beer. The milk chocolaty, almost chocolate milk like flavor was very nice in the nose and taste. It made a great after dinner drink tonight.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,grittybrews,4.07,"Poured a deep brownish-black into a Chimay chalice with around a finger of rich tan head that receded slowly to a thin film.  Nice aroma of slightly bitter chocolate followed up by moderate carbonation and a not-too-chewy mouthfeel of powdered chocolate, toasted malt, and cream. Nice clean finish with just a slight bitterness. I prefer Rogue's Shakespeare Stout, but this one is still a pleasure to drink!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Spica66,4.37,"What a surprise to me!!! I open a beer claiming to be a chocolate stout- and I smell chocolate! The aroma is that of a Tootsie Roll. Beautiful dark color, decent head. I figured there was no way this was going to taste as good as it smells. I was wrong. To quote my friend who was tasting it with me ""Who needs a fudge bar when you could have this?"" The body is a little thin, but for only $6 a bomber, this will be a common dessert beer at my house from now.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TCgoalie,3.88,"Notes from 5/14/10  The color is a touch of brown but shows mostly black. It pours a half finger tan head that lingers for a while. A bit of agitation and the head lasts the entire drinking time.  There is a hop bite in the smell that seems to blend with chocolate to produce a sweet grassy scent. There is also an essence of spice that seems to come from the alcohol.  The first noticeable thing in the taste is a good amount of bitterness. The bitter taste doesn't seem like it has much flavor, just bitter. The chocolate aftertaste reminds me of a powdered form of chocolate rather than rich candy chocolate. These two main flavors blend well and work together.  The mouthfeel is thin for a stout and the hops feel like they leave a drying effect on the tongue.  This is a drinkable stout, as to be expected at 6%. The bitterness seems to be a bit much hindering my want for more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A: Dark opaque black, with a huge foamy light brown head that produces small amounts of lacing on the glass.  S: Subtle chocolate aroma  T: Chocolate cocoa and burnt malt flavors and a bit of charcoal. Originally, I picked up a bit of unpleasant bitterness that seems to have disappeared as the beer warms to room temperature.  M: Medium bodied, not as full bodied as I would have expected for a rich stout. Lots of carbonation and a dry finish.  D: Nice sipping beer to have sitting on the patio on a cool spring evening. Would also pair well with a chocolate desert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,irishking1977,3.88,"A: Completely black hue, with a moderate tan head that leaves some decent lacing. Good looking brew.  S: Malty,and somewhat smoky. Some mild bitter chocolate as well.  T: Abundance of chocolate malt. Quite chalky and somewhat smoky, moreso than your average stout. Bitter chocolate notes round out the finish. Good, but I think my expectations were too high; this didn't meet them.  M: Chewy and quite chalky. Chalky, bitter chocolate lingers on the palate for awhile. Carbonation is adequate.  D: Better than average drinkability for a stout, which are normally heavy, and higher than average in ABV. This one is slightly above average in both categories, which makes it fairly drinkable in terms of stout drinkability. This one is more of a dessert beer, however, which seems great to pair with any food that is choclatey or smoked meats or cheeses.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Looked like a root beer float for a while.  S: Chocolate, roasted malts, coffee and cream. Very inviting.  T: Milk chocolate with coffee at first, then some nice hop bitterness mixes in and I get some semi-sweet chocolate at the end. Damn it's tasty, and the chocolate is clearly not a cheap syrup.  M: Heavier, and chewy, with ample carbonation.  D: Very drinkable dessert that I will absolutely be enjoying more of!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

I had this one back in the day, but my palate wasn't a mature as it now, so I had to give this one a whirl again  First off the pour was clean, really really dark black with a thick brown head.  It has an AMAZING smell of milk chocolate! This almost has the same smell as my favorite porter Victory at Sea by ballast point. I love it!!  The taste really cold is a chocolate milkshake. The name of this beer doesn't lie. As it heats up I get roasted coffee with a little more bitterness, but the chocolate runs this bad boy.  This beer is second to the Victory at sea when it comes to chocolate tasting beers. This has just became a top 5 stout for me",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Can tell this is not a baking chocolate but good quality chocolate. The more it warms up I get more of a raspberry smell in this.  T-- Thick and rich dark chocolate. First taste I thought it was powered chocolate. No sweetness at all with this. Just dark, bitter chocolate.  M-- Medium carbonation but a heavy mouthfeel. Very chewy and thick. Flavor lasts a while and the chocolate is quite coating. There is a bit of pine taste in the mouthfeel. Gives it an odd menthol feel to it. If it was more like mint that would be excellent.  D-- Feel like I am drinking a European chocolate bar. Just plain rich and thick chocolate. The pine is interesting and different. Just wish it was more like a mint feel, crisper and cooler. ABV is non existent and could easily drink 2 of these in a sitting. at $18 a pop is a bit hard though. Excellent beer and might become a staple this winter in Sydney.

132,1118,trahantheman,4.01,"poured dark from the bottle with enormous head, with big bubbles... more carbonation than i was anticipating. head was a dirty-tan.  aroma: chocolate. but not milk chocolate, dark chocolate. like 100% stuff. roasty toasty chocolate. i'd imagine that's what walking into a cocoa processing plant might smell like.  the taste? i'd imagine that's what a cocoa processing plant might taste like. seriously though it tastes like it smells and it's lovely. i get some charcoal bitterness on the back end accentuated by the hops which i felt were a little strong.  it feels wet but silky... medium-high carbonation could use a little tweaking maybe between the chocolate bitterness, hop bitterness, and carbonation bite there's a lot going on that might prevent you from really enjoying the nuances but if you're looking for a really good west-coast american interpretation of stout, and you like chocolate, this one is pretty solid.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Mora2000,4,"The beer pours dark brown with a tan head. The aroma is milk chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is roasted malt, chocolate syrup and piney hops. There is some surprising bitterness, either from the roasted malt or from the cascade hops. Medium-thick mouthfeel and a biting, high carbonation. A very nice beer, but I wish the hops were more in the background since I don't think the pine flavor melds real well with the chocolate notes.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Chadpaq,4.03,"A: Nearly dark as night, with minimal amounts of light permeating through. Just enough to let me know that it is indeed liquid, and not purely motor oil sitting at the bottom of my glass. I redact the last comment: ""motor oil"" hardly does the beer justice as far as pure beauty is concerned. Imagine taking the finest Belgian Dark Chocolate bar, melting it down, and pouring it into a glass. Hence, Chocolate Stout is born.  S: I smell nothing beer-related here, but I don't mean to detract from the beer with this comment. Dark chocolate, malty undertones, perhaps some sweet cocoa at the end of the inhalation.  T: My tastebuds are, for the most part, privy to more purely sweet tones when it comes to a chocolate stout. This Chocolate Stout seems to err on a more Dark-Chocolate, semi-sweet side. But I'm not complaining by any means. I think any sweeter and I would have gotten tired of this beer before the bottle was through. As it stood, it contained the perfect amount.  M: Nothing extremely spectacular, but certainly smooth. About like I expected. Felt like a true stout. Thick, heavy on the pallet, but ultimately swallowed clean and crisply. Very solid.  D: I'd definitely drink this beer again. Easily sessionable. I could have definitely gone for another bomber. I'll be back!  Some say that Rogue beers are overrated, claiming the appeal's merely derived from the silkscreen-printed bottles. While the bottles are very cool (and, almost reason-enough to buy the beer), I think the taste speaks for itself.

132,1118,BeerNemesis,4.43,"Rogue Chocolate Stout. 650 ml. ""bomber"". 6% ABV  On the label: ""Ebony in color with a rich creamy head. An earthy flavor of oats and hops that gives way to a rich chocolate truffle finish.""  Appearance: Pours pitch black with a 1.5"" bubbly light tan head that looks as soft as a down pillow. Thick chunky lacing leaves splatterings of foam on the side in abundance.  Aroma: Dark chocolate, sweet malts and a tiny amount of bitter hops. The chocolate seems more pronounced than in most ""chocolate"" stouts I've had.  Taste: Pretty mellow for a stout -- in a good way. I recently tasted the Rogue XS Imperial Stout, which was exceedingly bitter, and this is a nice change of pace. The flavor is lightly toasted malt, dark chocolate in abundance (though don't go thinking this will taste like chocolate milk) and a mocha background. The finish is mild: a little bit of sweetness followed by some residual bitterness. Aftertaste is bitter dark chocolate, though it doesn't stick around for long.  Mouthfeel: Thick, substantial, and very creamy. It accentuates the milder aspects of this stout -- cradling the dark chocolate and mocha tenderly. Carbonation surprisingly peeks through toward the end, which is a nice touch to keep it from being too heavy.  Drinkability: Mild flavor, 6% ABV, complexity, chocolate!, and a creamy, thick mouthfeel make this a pleasure to drink. Stouts tend to be less drinkable as a stand-alone beverage for me. However, this one did just fine. I think I would like it even better with a bar of chocolate and some soft bread.

This has a BIG aroma of old-fashioned chocolate creme soda. Other than that, there's just a bit of minerality. Not a ton going on, but pleasant.  Taste: Not as much chocolate as in the aroma; it's not sickeningly sweet, which I was afraid it might be. Bitter chocolate, burnt caramel, and tons of burnt grains. Pretty bitter; it seems like more than the 65 IBUs listed. Some lightly citric hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied  Drinkability: Medium-high  Conclusion: Not a bad stout at all, but not (IMO) up to the hype. Fairly tasty, but probably wouldn't buy it again.

Some sweet toasted grains and oats, but dominated by semi-sweet chocolate. Dark chocoalte flavors with toasted grain and oatmeal. Slight bitterness. Chocolate flavors are more on the unsweetend side. Dry coco powder comes to mind. Thick heavy mouthfeel. Might be able to stick a fork in it. Leaves the mouth lingering with chocolate notes. Great desert beer.

132,1118,drizzam,4.5,"For my 200th review I wanted to sample one of my favorite beer styles, the American Stout, so I chose one that has rated highly on BA. Let's see if it lives up to all the hype.  A - Poured from the brown bomber into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. A fairly aggressive pour yielded a dark opaque brown brew topped with a huge foamy tan head. This head was so intense that I actually had to wait several minutes to get my first taste of this brew....damn you beautiful head! A gorgeous frothy wall of frothy lacing was left down the inside of the glass. So far, so good!  S - My first thought was that this smelled like a chocolate milk shake. I also am catching just the slightest hint of hops lingering in the background. Very inviting aroma.  T & M - The chocolate I smelled in the nose is certainly present and it frolics playfully with the roasted malt and Cascade and Willamette hops. I was a little surprised to read that this brew has a 69 IBU rating...it almost doesn't taste that high because of the chocolate sweetness. Smooth medium body finishes with a bit of hop bitterness in the aftertaste.  D - This is one helluva drinkable brew! Rogue certainly knows what they are doing with stouts, and it shows since they have 2 beers in the top 4 for this particular beer style. This beer works on several levels, dessert beer or just all around good brew. I'll be recommending this one to my friends!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Mancer,4,"Poured (into a pint glass) a jet black, with a dark brown head. The head measured two fingers. The initial smell of this beer was that of coffee, and possibly cocoa. The initial taste of the beer was that of chocolate, malts, coffee, and some roastiness. There was a definite bitter kick to it, which was quite nice. The brew finished with a roasted chocolate flavor, which lingered for a little while. The brew was medium to full bodied and left lacing on the glass.  An additional note to add is that it was very carbonated, I found myself belching more than usual. Definitely a beer I'd buy again, but not one that I would go out of my way to get. Worth a try to anyone who hasn't tried it yet.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Not as much sweet chocolate as the smell would suggest. More roasted malt flavor comes forward.  The mouthfeel is thinner than I expected, and there is quite a bit of carbonation. The mouthfeel is the weakest part of the beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jpro,4.42,"Had this on tap at the Rogue Public House in Portland a few months back and was impressed - this review is based on the bomber I'm currently enjoying. I like this bottle - lots of good info printed on it: ingredients, food pairings, IBU's, etc. (no freshness date, though). Pours black with a rich, two-finger hazelnut head that leaves patches of lace and manages a thin layer of retention. Aroma is dominated by chocolatey goodness, but there are also some light roasted coffee notes, oats and minty hops in the nose. The taste starts with a touch of minty hops, which quickly gives way to roasted malts and dark chocolate. Finish is sweet chocolate; there's a bit of lasting bitterness (with some light citrus notes) - the light roasted flavor lingers on the palate, too. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied; its a little chewy and there's a light zing from the carbonation. Personally, this is one of my favorite stouts and it's even more enjoyable on draft - its chocolatey and a touch hoppy. Probably my favorite Rogue ale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

About a finger of quickly dissipating head that leaves great looking lacing.  Smell - Bittersweet chocolate. A very slight hint of coffee, however, the main smell here is malty, sweet, bittersweet chocolate. My mouth is salivating in anticipation to try this after a rather bland dinner.  Taste - As the nose presented, the first taste here is bittersweet chocolate. Great malty goodness mixed with oats. This reminds me a bit of Anderson Valley Oatmeal Stout to be honest. In addition to the overwhelming chocolate flavors, there was, as in the nose, a slight hint of coffee but not by any means strong or like a coffee stout.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, creamy, and relatively full.  Drinkability - Great after dinner beer but not something I would just open for the hell of it. I've had this for some time now and am glad I opened it tonight. Pretty good!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,jeremyn,4.08,"Pretty, creamy, light brown head that needs some agitation to get going. The nose of roasted malt and chocolate is simple but elegant. Taste is reminiscent of the nose. Nothing complex... roasted malt and chocolate, but extremely intense. Bigger hop flavor that I expected from this style, but not a lot of bitterness. Tastes dry hopped but probably isn't. Thinner mouthfeel than I expected, but I think that works in its favor. Still a little mouth-coating creaminess, presumably from the oats, which gives it some richness. Carbonation is appropriate and its drinkability is good.  I can't say this beer is anything particularly innovative, but it is intense and delicious.

Thanks to OneNote81 for sending a second bottle of this beer to me after it broke in the first box! What a crazy story...  A - A tall pour creates totally huge cascading that ends in a three+ finger head with awesome retention. The dark mocha foam left rings and rings of lace white dropping slowly. The beer itself is black as midnight.  S - This beer smells like it's got chocolate chunks floating in it! Rich milk chocolate all over the nose. Tons of roasted malts to back it up. A touch of milky cream in there too with a caramel-cube sweetness. Just a rich, bold, thick aroma. A small hop aroma comes across on the finish.  T - Unfortunately the flavor doesn't live up to the hyped nose but it's close. A bit too much hops come out and really draw away from the bold roasted malts and thick milk chocolate. The flavor just ends up being thinner than anticipated.  M - Medium-full bodied and smooth with a roasty and hoppy bitter, dry finish. Not as rich as I would have liked to have had in the mouthfeel.  D - Not as drinkable as I anticipated from both the name and the aroma. A little too thin, much drier, and hoppier than I wanted. Don't get me wrong, it's still awesome but not as chocolaty as he name and smell let on.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Interesting, but not quite amazing.  M: Medium body with moderate carbonation.  D: Something about the way the hops and chocolate interact isn't really doing it for me.  Notes: This one disappointed me. It wasn't bad by any means, but the chocolate flavors just seemed artificial and cloying. I'm glad I tried a pint instead of buying a bomber.

Nice chocolate and oat combo, a bit of roasted malts, earthy notes and hops. The problem is it feels a bit watery, it would be truly stellar if it had some more body to it.

Taste is likewise chocolaty with a bite from the hops that makes for a balanced beer that begs to be drunk. The mouthfeel is creamy and full with a bitter, clean finish and just enough carbonation to carry the tastes and entice the palate.  Drinkability is awesome, as with most Rogue products.

Then loads of dark and milk chocolate that gives a bitter and some sweet taste. A little bit of a cherry flavor. Decent amount of hops giving a slight citrus taste. Starts off somewhat sweet and progresses to finish somewhat bitter.  M - Medium body with good carbonation. Pretty smooth and creamy but it is a little thinner than what I was expecting.  D - Pretty good. Not too sweet or bitter. Lots of chocolate, but it is well balanced as are the malts and hops. Goes down easy but it would have been better if it were slightly thicker.

S - muted on the nose but as it warms it becomes a little bit clearer but only a baking chocolate and mild roasted maltyness is detectable.  T - a bittersweet dark chocolate flavor and the some more coffee/roasted malt sort of bitterness. Overall this chocolate stout comes off alittle to bitter to me.  M - full bodied medium carb right for the style.  D - drinkable. I just didn't think it was as balanced as it couldve been.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,KrisPaulk77,4.45,"Served on tap at the Keg and Barrel, Hattiesburg.  The beer was served in a standard pint glass, and was pitch black, with a big, creamy khaki colored head of foam. An absolute pleasure to look at. The aroma was rich and full of big chocolate notes, both milk chocolate and bittersweet, faint roast notes, and sweet malts. The taste didn't disappoint. The taste was aroma personified. Rich chocolate notes, creamy and full bodied, with hints of bitterness to help balance. Chocolate is the name of the game here. Tasty brew indeed. This is a superb beer. I hate that it took me so long to get around to trying it, but now that I've found a pub with it on draft, Chocolate Stout has found it's way into my rotation. Excellent offering from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,JerzDevl2000,4.62,"Picked this up recently because it's on the top 100 U.S. beer list here and it just *sounded* good from reading the bottle and the ingredients that went into this. Sure enough, this beer lived up to the hype and just may be the best one I've had in quite a long time. Winter has been hellish here in the northeast this year but thankfully, this made one of the cold nights much easier to get through!  Sure enough, this pours like a liquid dark chocolate bar and the frothiness is like a nice milkshake on top to boot. The lacing is moderate and the aroma is just like the taste - smooth, fairly strong, with some hops and a soft, rich dark chocolate back to it. No espresso, bitter chocolate, or alkali to be found here. The best way of describing this is taking a Ghirardelli bar and just having some west coast hoppy fun with it. This is very well balanced and not strong enough in the taste or alcohol department; in other words, I could have easily enjoyed this whole bottle even though I split it with a friend that night.  It seems like a lot of the top Stouts on here are involved in an ""Arms race"" of sorts as they attempt to be more strong and extreme. This is on the other end of the shock scale. Nothing complex about this but one look at the list of what went into this on the side of the bottle and you'll know that this is well crafted as any bomber on your local retailer's shelf. For any beer or chocolate aficionado, this is certainly not to be missed!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The smell is a mix of milky chocolate and dark bitter chocolate. The taste starts with a milky chocolate flavor that moves on to a bitter yet chocolaty kind of finish. The finish in particular is amazing: it highlights a blend of bitter hops, slightly bitter, slightly sweet chocolate and slightly sweet, slightly Smokey and slightly bitter malts. Overall an excellent chocolate stout that has strong chocolate flavors without being too sweet.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

There is a very creamy dark head, lots of retention, and lots of lacing. The nose has the whiff of an imperial stout, with a bit of booziness, some earthy and herbal notes too. The taste is not all that complicated.  The taste is a bit of burnt chocolate, dry, and bittering from the bakers chocolate extract. The beer has crystal malts and dark malts. This isn't overly complicated beer. It has tons of chocolate flavors throughout, some carbonation and this isn't a flat stout by any means. The roasted and slightly charred flavors are nice, the beer is very creamy on the tongue and very mild in the aftertaste.

Slightly more bitter than I was expecting.  m - Little carbonation and a lighter body than I was expecting, on the medium side.  d - Overall this was a very good chocolate stout.

132,1118,OneDropSoup,4.03,"Poured into a shaker: 3 fingers of glistening, lumpy, light brown head over what appears to be an opaque black body. Looks like a latte from the top. Leaves thick but spotty lacing.  Smells like chocolate milk made with Hershey's syrup but with a notable hop presence, enough pine to balance it out & give it some bite. Very subtle roasty smell.  Smell carries through in the taste, except the chocolate is bowled over quickly by hops & roast. Aftertaste is bitterly chocolate, with a small kind of meaty/smoky taste in there too.  Mouthfeel is creamy, approaching flatness, with punch from bitter elements.  All around pleasurable. I like my sweet beers like a dessert, & this had a little more bite that I'd expected, but still very good & enjoyable on its own terms.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The body was a seemingly uncarbonated opaque dark brown... almost black.  S- Smells of roasty and crystal malts laced with chocolate liqueur, with just a touch of hop aroma.  T- A nice replicate of the nose: sweet crystal and roasted malts and chocolate liqueur, with a mild hop bitterness coming-in midway and through the finish. The finish itself is sustained with the aforementioned hop bitterness as well as some dark chocolate notes.  M- A nice firm body, packed with unattenuated sugar. But the carbonation is a bit coarse, abundant and somewhat bloating... I've had worse offenders in the carbonation department, but this definitely takes it down from what would have been a '4.5' in mouthfeel.  D- Nice aromas and luscious flavors for an astoundingly low 6% ABV... but the carbonation issue kills the drinkability for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

This smells amazing. I cannot wait any longer to dive in. It smells like the perfect desert beer to follow up my chili burger with.  T - Chocolate up front, but a nice smooth dark unsweetened chocolate almost like the kind used in baking. There is a malt presence but it is not overpowering. It provides a nice balanced sweetness. This is a very tasty chocolate stout. Almost perfectly done in my opinion.  M - Melted dark chocolate bars in a glass. Everything I could have imagined in a stellar chocolate stout and more. Little if any carbonation. My only complaint is it's a little on the thin side.  D - For the style, this is top of the class. I could not imagine a chocolate stout that is more drinkable.

132,1118,Mavajo,3.86,"This is one beautiful beer. Pours an almost black body with a huge, voluminous, fluffy light brown head. This thing sticks around longer than your inlaws. I sipped this bomber over the course of about two hours (two pours), and both pours still had plenty of head left when I finished. Might be the best head retention I've seen in a beer. Nice sticky lacing cascades down the whole glass. Gorgeous.  I tried this beer once before on tap and was left mildly disappointed. The great appearance had be hopeful, but once I got to the taste and aroma, I again felt a bit let down. The chocolate goes without saying, but there's also a surprising abudance of bitterness and hops here. It's not a smack in the tastebuds by any measure, but it was a surprise. Basically, this thing taste like chocolatey hops.  The mouthfeel I found oddly watery...but still fairly full bodied at the same time. Hard to explain that obvious dichotomy, but that was the sensation I experienced. Carbonation was fairly mild - maybe that lended to the ""watery"" sensation.  All in all, this is a good brew, but I don't think it lives up to the hype. That's not really the fault of the beer though. It's still a good beer; but in my opinion, it's simply another good beer - it doesn't do anything to disgtinguish itself, IMO.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Wonderfully complex and rich smells.  T- Wow, this taste came out of left field- starts off more bitter and less chocolate, than it turns a 180 and ends on bittersweet cocoa nubs and ground espresso.

132,1118,inxy,3.14,"Hmm.  A * Poured into a simple pint glass. Dark, dark in pour, dark in the cup. Zero transperancy. Light brown head that dwindles down to nothing across the surface, light stickyness of head wedged in the corner where the beer meets the cup. Lacing is thin lines but plentiful all the way around the cup.  S * Wow. Smells wonderful. Smells like walking into a fine chocolate shop. Dark chocolate, malt, coffee, and molasses.  T * I'm confused here. I don't pick up any hops in the nose but they are very prominent, almost too bitter for what I'm prepared for. I am expecting dark chocolate and malt, which are there, but the taste is overwhelmed with hop bitterness, almost soured in combination with the other flavors. Reminiscent of old coffee. I'm wondering if this bottle has been sitting under the lights too long.  M * Smooth, kinda creamy, over-carbonated. I'm immediately hit with an odd sour bitterness in the back of my tongue which is throwing off any potential it has for a good creamy mouthfeel.  D/Overall * I'm disappointed. I'm kinda worried this was an old bottle that was sitting for too long. I got it for $4.99 which around here is an amazing price for a Rogue 22oz, generally they're $6.99.

Sometimes there is a bit of a sour milk and smoke characteristic on the nose.  Flavor is quite chocolaty, not as strong as the nose, fair amount of bitterness, some caramel, roasted malt, a bit acidic.  Mouthfeel is a little thin, but soft, low carbonation.

S - Smells largely of rich milk chocolate (not surprising). Just a hint of roasted malt. Smells a touch sweet and a bit creamy...maybe just a hint of vanilla.  T - As expected, there is a strong chocolate component in the flavor, but less than the aroma would indicate. A lot more dark roasted malts and burnt flavors. Earthy and grassy hops. Sharply bitter from the burnt malts...very nice - better balance of flavors with the chocolate than I expected.  M - Creamy and silky smooth. Medium bodied and carbonation is on the low side.

Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Sure looks like a beauty.  The aroma is filled with chocolate goodness. Milk chocolate mostly that reminds me of a chocolate milkshake.  The flavor is much more complex than the aroma. There is plenty of chocolate flavor but it is partly balanced by some bitterness from the malt and hops. Some earthy and floral hints from the hops as well.  Not the biggest body for a stout but the result is a lower ABV that makes this much more drinkable. Carbonation is good and lends a nice texture.

Nose is deep chocolate, rich, just straight up chocolate-malt milkshake. A very light, coarse hop note comes through underneath, but it's clearly outshined.  Taste is pretty fascinating - huge, authentic chocolate is right there in the front, though it does its thing with almost no sweetness backing it up. Instead, you get a dry body, moderate bitterness, with leafy hops ruling the roost as the chocolate starts to fade towards the finish. Very balanced, and pretty unorthodox.  Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied but full in flavor, and maybe just a bit coarse in the carbonation department.  Drinkability is decent, but the overall beer has a bit of a coarse feel, from the hop character to the bitterness to the carbonation. Beautiful execution of chocolate character, but that's by far the strongest suit of the beer.

132,1118,wnh,4.15,"22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.  Pours a ruby-red-tinted black, opaque, with significant highlights when held up to the light. Topped by a large foamy and creamy tan head.  Mouthwatering aroma of chocolate truffles dominates the nose, to the point that it's difficult to get much of anything else out of it. But the chocolate aroma is so good, I don't care. Very minimal roast; color of the beer is about the only thing telling me this is a stout.  Chocolate, of course, on the palate, with a touch of minerality hinting at a dry Irish stout. Finishes with a light bitterness closely associated with cold hour-old medium-roast coffee. Sweet on the whole, but thankfully not cloying. Thinnish in body, but not watery; somehow, the thinness seems associated with the ""natural chocolate flavoring added,"" but I can't specify why that is. Very drinkable, regardless. Indeed, doesn't taste like a beer with natural flavor added.  Not the best chocolate-infused stout I've had, but a solid offering, especially since this isn't an imperial.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,plaid75,4.2,"On draft at the Rogue Ale House, Portland, Oregon.  Poured a deep brown hue with a one finger off white head. There was good retention and lacing.  The smell featured a rich dark chocolate aroma with elements of dry cocoa and chocolate icing.  The taste consisted of flavors of dark chocolate, dry coffee, cocoa powder and tootsi roll.  The mouthfeel was full and creamy.  Overall a very rich and accessible dessert stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ludachris,4.59,"Pours a slick opaque black with nice ruby red highlights. 1 finger of mocha coloured head that has decent retention and leaves some nice lacing.  Heaps of milk chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt toasted malts, light coffee, and hints of vanilla, all of which become much more pronounced as the beer warms.  Dry cocoa takes the center with notes of milk chocolate in the back. Burnt towards the end with some roasted malts and a really nice dry coffee finish. There's loads of chocolate in the taste but manages not to be sickly sweet.  Medium bodied, smooth, crisp and dry. Loads of flavour but very easy to drink.  Another excellent stout from Rogue. I enjoyed this one just as much if not more than their Shakespeare Stout. Loads of flavour, perfectly balanced, not too sweet, and very easy to drink. An excellent dessert beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jrallen34,4.02,"I drank this from a 22 oz bottle into a Rochefort glass.  The beer is black with a light to medium tan head rising about 2 fingers and falling to quickly. There is great lacing.  The aroma is awesome with tons of light better chocolate on the front, its like smelling a chocolate cake. At the end before being overwhelmed with just sweetness you get a nice bitter hoppiness.  The taste is all chocolate. There front is sweet chocolate but then it fades it bitter chocolate all the way. The taste is too much bitter chocolate and one note for me to be great. Its a nice change of pace.  The feel is decent not terribly drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Sean9689,4.14,"Perfect cold night to open one of these. 2009 vintage. Poured from 22oz bomber into my DFH snifter.  A - Pours black with a tannish-brown head. A very thin quarter of a fingers worth of head forms and quickly disipiates into nothingness. Some thin remnants remain on top of the beer along with a thin ring around the edge of the glass. No lacing.  S - Sweet milk chocolate is the dominant note. Smells like Ghirardelli chocolate, high-end stuff, really good. That's pretty much all I get off the nose, but I don't care, cause it smells so damn good. Excellent!  T - Taste isn't as good as the nose, but still good. Dark chocolate and milk chocolate mixed together. Some bitterness on the finish. Rich creamy burnt malts, caramels, but mostly, lots of chocolate goodness.  M - Full bodied and slight carbonation, both perfect for this beer.  D - So good on a cold winter night. The bomber is all mine!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,tmoneyba,4.27,Bomber bottle. Black color with moderate light brown head that diminished slowly and had good lacing. Complex sweet malt and chocolate aroma. Full body with a creamy texture. Good complex bitter chocolate and coffe flavor with a long bittersweet finish. Very good sweet stout.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ujsplace,4.64,"Poured into an over sized pub glass.  A: Thick, dense tan head that leaves great lacing. The color is nearly black - a very nice looking brew...  S: Semi-sweet chocolate and bitter hops.  T: Wow... big chocolate flavor with a nice bitter hop finish. This tastes almost exactly like it smells.  M: Thick and creamy medium carbonation.  D: I am loving this chocolate stout. The abv actually allows this to be a nice session brew. Really great...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kzoobrew,4.2,"The pour appears to be a cola brown with slight reddish tint. The body settles in a black with only slivers of ruby highlights gleaming through the thinnest edges. Cocoa tinged head stands two fingers tall and recedes ever so slowly. Very full sheet of lacing surrounds the perimeter of the glass.  The chocolate is undeniable and expected to be strong in the nose. The underlying rich roasted malt aroma is the difference between good and great. A toasted caramel scent is subtle sitting behind the much deeper stronger smells adds another layer for the nose to discern.  The flavor matches the nose step for step. Chocolate is the focus though once again the deep roasted malt is not to be denied. Chocolate is primarily bittersweet though has a touch of a more raw cocoa flavor meandering about. Light citric flavor and bitterness contributed from the hops.  The mouthfeel is medium to full. Very smooth and creamy. Viscosity is very much in line with the style. I often forget a stout does not need to be overly thick to be enjoyable. While my preference is for a more full bodied brew I cannot mark this down simply based on personal preference.  Very enjoyable and easily drinkable. There is absolutely nothing offensives about this brew. Though Rogue can be hit or miss with me when considering their entire line up, Chocolate Stout is definitely on the top tier of Rogue offerings.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,willmc,4.5,"On Sight: Pours a very deep dark almost black into a tulip stout glass. A good 2 finger tan head, with plenty of lacing left behind. Aromas: Strong chocolate right away with lots of sweetness. Hints of coffee, or maybe more of an espresso. Lots of chocolate on the nose. Tastes: Wow, it's like eating a dark chocolate bar. Not as sweet as I thought it would be based on the aromas. By far one of the better chocolate stouts I have had. Rogue hardly ever disappoints with its beer, a great chocolate, coffee, heavy beer. Wouldn't want to drink too many of these at one time. Would be great served with a slice of chocolate cake or other dessert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,NicholasCasber,4.2,"A: This beer pours a dark, solid dark brown. Immediately you can smell the chocolate, but more on that in a minute. Once poured the head is a nice hazelnut color which seems to stay throughout the whole drink.  S: The chocolate smell is absolutely wonderful to catch wafting from the newly opened bottle. After the initial blast of chocolate, which, seems to be the perfect amount, comes the delicious smell of the hops, and the warm smell of the roasted barely. The overall aroma is very warm, and brings back good memories of chocolate as a kid.  T: The taste, is by far one of my favorites in my beer explorations. Leaps and bounds above some of the other stouts that I've had, it blasts your tongue with chocolate and just like the aroma, finishes off nice and smooth with an almost bitter taste, which leaves you wanting more.  M: This totally coats your mouth with a delicious taste, and doesn't feel overly heavy like most stouts. Completely impressed by this beer's feel.  D: If I could rate this beer low in any category, it'd be the drinkability. It's not that I don't think I could drink this beer often, it's just that I don't think I can drink this beer every day, and that's how I judge my drinkability. However, that's just my opinion, but still, a 4 is still darn high.  Overall, this beer is by far one of my favorites, and I'd recommend it to you and any of my friends. I wish you the best of luck on your beer endeavors and as always, Cheers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Eldalonde,4.12,"A - Pours nice & dark with a full head that lasts pretty good.  S - The smell of sweet chocolate is immediate and dutifully powerful.  T - Small notes of roasted coffee can be found among the striking flavor of rich chocolate truffel on the palate. The finish provides for a touch hops, but not too noticeable and brings a nice balance. This is a great stout with terrific chocolate flavor.  M - This is nice and thick, but not overly so like some impy stouts can be.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S. Mmmm. Burnt malt and chocolate. Very nice.  T. Creamy chocolate flavor. Balanced well with the malt sweetness. Some bitter coffee flavors as well. Good beer.  M. Rich, thick mouthfeel. Kind of low carbonation. Kind of syrupy and sticky like.  D. Goes down easy. I wish I would have bought more than one.

Good retention leaves drippy lace rings.  Chocolate milk, espresso, and burnt brownie aroma. Taste is a similar soft chocolate espresso with a bakers chocolate bittersweet. There's a sour roast/cough syrup/peanut oil off flavor in there somewhere which I'm not a fan of. Rogue pacman body.  Good.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,adamette,4.1,"Live review. Poured from the 650 ML bottle that I purchased along with 5 other Rogue beers within the past month. Poured into my Cooperstown Beverage Trail pint glass. I heard good things about this beer here on BA and decided to pick up a bunch of Rogue beers that day. No observed ""best by"" date.  A Nice, creamy medium brown head over a very dark body that lets in only a bit of light when held in front of a light bulb. There is the darkest of Mahogany colors that shows through the body in that situation. Lacing is satisfyingly significant. 4.0  S Chocolate is in the front. To me it is a nice, full milk chocolate smell that is inviting and interesting. I do not smell much of the dark roast malt that I might have expected but then again most stouts are not all that aromatic. 4.0  T Nice, direct dark roast malt with chocolate. The hops play an appropriate supporting role. I like the simplicity and the mastery of the brewer. 4.5  M Thinner than I expected but it works for this beer somehow. Other similar beers (Southern Tier Choklat, Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti) might be more thick but here it does not bother me. It might make it more drinkable. 4.0  D Good for the style which tends to include such huge beers as to render them less that highly drinkable. This remains a sipper for me, one to be enjoyed over a period of 25 minutes or so. 3.5  Notes: I can see why so many people enjoy this one, a solid chocolate stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,AHebel,3.78,"I've had a few chocolate stouts and this one is slightly underwhelming, compared mostly with the outrageous Choklat by Southern Tier. The appearance is great, showing thick and dark with a light brown 1/4 inch head (poured into a snifter). Mouthfeel is good, but a bit thin and bubbly. The smell is light chocolate, which, when tasted, translates about the same: a tad underwhelming. A mild hoppy character comes in towards the end to cut a bit of the up front, malty sweetness, which creates a good balance. This is definitely an above average example of the style, but it didn't make me say ""Wow!"" or ""This is ""World Class.""""",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,slk22,4.2,"Pours an opaque black color with a thick light-brown head showing good retention. Strong chocolate and caramel malt aroma jumps right out of the glass. Nice, but not complex. Taste begins with a nice balance of roasted and sweet malt flavor. Then a bit of hop bitterness comes out along with a sort of baker's chocolate bitterness that lingers a bit with a dry finish. Very nicely balanced for a chocolate stout in my opinion. Mouthfeel is smooth although body (light to medium) is a bit lighter than expected and carbonation is higher than expected. Overall, a very tasty beer that I could have several of.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Mayhem976,4.63,"A- Poured into a super tall glass, it's ultra black and very thick. It does produce a super large head that keeps building and building, I thought it was going to over flow there for a minute, tons of lacing. Beautiful looking beer.  S- I smell bitter hops and bitter coffee with a small trace of dark rich chocolate on the finish, very roasty, almost smells burnt.  T- POW... there it is, perfection! You'll get alot of hops but it's complimented very well with a bitter heavy roast super dark chocolate, it does finish a bit dry. I've never tasted a chocolate stout filled with so much roast character, Rogue was not afraid of brewing a kick you in the face chocolate stout. Most other chocolate stouts I've tasted are smooth, subtle, and sweet. This stout slaps you on the side of the head and waves hi. :P Amazing.  M- Creamy, thick, ultra rich, and very pleasant.  D- High on the drinkability scale for the purposes of enjoying a delicious dessert beer, would I pound this watching a football game? Probably not. I would like to note I purchased this bomber for $4.99, so it's a great price for an amazing stout. When ""I"" drink this I want to savor the ingredients and pair it with an aged Torano Exodus cigar or perhaps even a Partagas Black.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,wahhmaster,4.03,Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a Macado's Halloween-branded American pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a pitch black color with a thick creamy tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves considerable lacing.  Smell: Smells like a bar of baking chocolate. Also has considerable roasted malt notes.  Taste: Starts hoppy. Finishes chocolatey with considerable roasted maltiness as well. Also has a little bit of a coffee flavor to it. Very well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and full-bodied with a sticky finish.  Drinkability: A tasty stout and one I would love to try again some time. Another win for Rogue!,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ArrogantDeadGuy,4.47,"Pitch black pour with a beautifully tanned head. The flow off of draft looks sturdy and oil rich. The frothy cap grew and grew until it grew out of my glass. The cap stayed for the full term and was left in the bottom of the glass. This brew has a great cocoa flavor with a nice bitter finish that is complimentary to the initial sweetness. This is a great chocolate and coffee representation in the aroma. This brew is missing a little of the toasty nuttiness in the flavor that I was expecting from the aroma. The mouth feel isn't as hearty as I had expected from the pour but far from thin and still properly bodied. The bitterness of the cocoa persists throughout jumping up and down on the pallet. This is no subtle brew and once you start don't plan on moving on, this one owns the pallet for quite a while.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Josievan,4.08,"Appearance: Deep, dark brown approaches black. Head lingers for several minutes and lacing is heavy.  Smell: Heavy on roasted malts and dark chocolate.  Taste: Chocolately in a noticeable, yet subtle way. Some sips taste like a shot of chocolate milk was put in this beer, others taste like premium dark chocolate was ground into a powder and dissolved in the beer. Despite these fine flavors, this is still a full-bodied stout, first and foremost; a stout's stout, as it were.  Mouthfeel: Very thick and creamy with moderate carbonation. There is a bitter aftertaste from the dark chocolate and roasted malts that lingers, but this is expected.  Drinkability: I finished my pint surprisingly quickly for a beer with so much flavor and body. Very drinkable for such a heavy stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,MbpBugeye,3,"A- Pours a cola brown that collects into a black body with hints of red. Deep tan head that never really goes away, throwing some lacing up the sides of the glass.  S- Strong. Big wafts of chocolate. It smells like a tootsie roll.  T- Less chocolate that I expected. Mostly roasty and charred. Some earthiness towards the end followed by some hops.  M- Thinner than I had hoped. Fluffy carbonation. Smooth  D- This is an alright beer. Nothing awful but I dont think I'll have it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,PaleAlien2,4.02,Dense blackness with a brown one-finger head. Ring is retained at the top to leave sporadic lacing on the glass.  Smells like dark chocalate and roasted coffee.

132,1118,MasterSki,3.65,"Picked this up a while ago at Binnys. Finally got around to it. Served in a Pisgah pint glass.  A - Pours with two fingers of dark mocha foam that dissipates fairly quickly to a thickish cap. There are a few tiny specks of lace. Body is a super dark brown that is only a tiny bit lighter with a touch of reddish glow at the fringes.  S - Huge cocoa smell - reminds me of Hershey's chocolate syrup. There's also a nice amount of roastiness and some floral hops, but milk chocolate is incredibly intense and just takes over. I don't even know if I'd be able to tell if this was beer if you gave it to me blind. It's a little mono-dimensional, but it doers exactly what it sets out to do.  T - The taste is a big step down - light cocoa, roasted malts, and a strange earthy and slightly unpleasant aftertaste. I'm not sure if that's what Rogue describes as ""chocolate truffle finish"", but it tastes like dirt to me. The initial taste is more of a 3.5/4.0 but the aftertaste drags it down.  M - Higher carbonation than I'd expect - tingles a little and burns a touch at the back end. Medium body that is fairly smooth once the carbonation dies down. Lots of residual stickiness that unfortunately carries that weird aftertaste with it (although I'm not going to punish the mouthfeel for the taste).  D - The ABV is low and well-hidden, and the carbonation, while higher, isn't bloaty. I just can't deal with that weird aftertaste, although it dissipates quickly enough that the beer is still fairly drinkable (and you can always drink more to cover it up!).",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jwhawkins81,3.34,Aroma - Roasted malts like crystal malts to be specific.  Appearance - Dark brown with a brown tan head that quickly dissipated.  Taste - Roasted malt and then tons of bitter hops and chocolate. Maybe too much bitterness for my taste. I think I'm too sensitive to hops to enjoy this beer. Not enough of the roasted malts to redeem this for me.  Notes - Good mouthfeel with a decent level of carbonation.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,techfed87,4.29,"Going into this, I can tell this is going to be a good beer. Wow, the smell definitely gives off a coco aroma. Pours a solid, heavy brown head. Collapses down into the glass with depressions forming as the head dissipates. Pours a dark black.  First sip gives a sharp cocoa taste, closing with a slightly sweeter note. The aftertaste takes a bit of getting used to. Not to say that it isn't unpleasant, it's actually quite nice. But it can be a bit intimidating at first.  Body is very fulfilling. Has a great feel in the mouth. Carbonation is just enough, not too bubbly, not too flat. Everything just seems to click with this beer. It is everything that it promises and more. I've learned to respect Rogue beers, and this beer does everything to re-enforce that view, and more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BDJake,4.52,"Tried a few weeks back, but I hadn't gotten around to reviewing it until now for various reasons. Dark ruby brown with a thick brown head that left good lacing. Smells of dark chocolate and a slight bit of coffee in the background. Tastes like unsweetened dark chocolate (awesome) and had a bit of a roasted character to it, with some notes of coffee and dark fruitiness to compliment the chocolatey body. Surprisingly smooth, with good carbonation- not too heavy, leaving you to enjoy it at your own pace. It went down very easily, while still retaining full character. I did use a good portion of the bottle to make two floats (received as payment for moving a couch for my brother's girlfriend) and was able to get an ample review from the remainder of the bottle poured into a pint glass. Once you've had this, you won't even be able to look at a Guinness again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Hints of rich, smooth dark chocolate are immediately discernible, followed by hints of carob and raw cacao.  Roasty, smoky dark chocolate flavors are most prominent. A sweet, powdery cocoa-like flavor backs up the darker chocolate. Subtle notes of coffee and fig are also present. Smooth, slightly dry, clean finish.  Mouthfeel is crisp, clean and very smooth, with mild carbonation. Delicious on the palate. A heartier presence was expected.  Very delicious. I imagine, with chocolate cheesecake or chocolate brulee, it would make for a most decadent dessert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,BetterDarker,4.48,"Bomber poured into tulip glass.  Appearance - Very dark, nearly black with mocha head. Head is almost an inch think in the tulip glass with decent retention. Looks stunning,  Smell - Immediate chocolate aroma, actually smells like a malted chocolate frappe, but not as sweet. I can not detect any hop aroma.  Taste - Taste like chocolate, with further hints of chocolate. Some bitterness, I can not believe the bottle states 69 IBU, which leads me to believe that this beer is very well balanced between the sweet and bitter. This beer is absolutely delicious.  Mouthfeel - Very smooth, great lingering aftertaste, my only slightly negative comment could be possible over carbonation.  Drinkability - Very easy to consume, and yes please, I will have another.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,GeezLynn,4.18,"Appearance is jet black with a medium brown head. Dark malt and cocoa combination smells very similar to a tootsie roll with the slightest hints of pine and mustiness. A taste brings molasses, milk chocolate, slight roasted coffee flavors. Loads of chocolate, but not overly sweet and finishes dry. The feel is medium bodied for the style and a little heavy on the carbonation. Despite the deluge of chocolate flavor, I found this to be a very drinkable, and maybe more so than most in its class.  This is a unique beer - one that is extremely chocolaty, yet not so sweet and syrupy that it takes away from its drinkability.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Body is black as the night itself. Aroma is chocolate, or more accurately as the bottle describes...chocolate truffle. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. I would estimate that this bottle is one year old by the amount of yeast sediment/buildup at the bottom of the bottle...the perfect age for this slow to attenuate chocolate stout. Taste is creamy and smooth with some mild hops and mild alcohol heat. Some coffee notes, but mainly just chocolaty greatness. This is the best chocolate stout on Earth.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Nice sticky lacing.  Smell is quite potent with rich milk chocolate and cocoa as well.  Taste is a wonderful! Now this is what I want to taste in a beer with the word chocolate on the label. A combination of sweet milk chocolate and a nice roasted dark chocolate malt bitterness towards the end. This is just about chocolate desert in liquid form to me. Very rich and pleasant!  Mouthfeel is full bodied, nice and smooth. Cream with a mild amount of carbonation. Feels very nice on the tongue.  Drinakability in a word, fantastic! This is by far one of the best stouts I've ever had. It goes down very nicely and leaves me wanting to grab another bottle.

132,1118,FernMaster,3.7,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  I can't say I'm overall truly impressed with this beer, I like it fine but there's several things working against it to make it great. If you're reading this on a smart phone at a liquor store, just buy this beer; Rogue Chocolate Stout is worth trying. I will probably try this again in the future and I may update my review accordingly, but let's get into it.  The pour was actually disappointing, there was less than one finger's worth of head. The head was a nice brown color and the beer was a thick black, with some moderate lacing. The smell may have been my favorite thing about this beer. Rogue's Chocolate Stout smells like a fine dessert, there's some definite notes of cocoa powder, roasted malts and - of course - chocolate. The taste however is not very stoutish, it seems very watered down. There's some hop notes, chocolate, hints of vanilla,",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mmva321,3.95,"Served in a pint glass.  All is pretty standard for a hopsy stout. Nice dark body with a somewhat dissapointingly small amount of caramel colored head that leaves a nice, delicate lacing as you drink. The smell is very intricate, if a little too faint for me. Lots of smells: cocoa powder, vanilla, hops, roasted malt; all are very well balanced and leave a nice, faint auroma in your nose. I just wish there was a bit more robustness. The taste is good but not surprising or astounding. The hops, always well done in Rogue products, really take center stage and really leave the faint chocolate flavors as more of a side note. But still... good. It feels fine enough, though it is a little watery for my taste in stouts. Little carbonation is present. So all in all, a good drink and a good beer. I understand it in those terms but not as a top 100 beer and certainly not as the best Rogue has to offer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

I poured a 22oz chocolate stout into a soft drink cup in the gas station where I got it because I wanted to instantly drink it and Starkville has a 0 tolerance drinking-in-the-street law.  The color was very dark and rich - motor oil.  The smell was quite strong, extreme chocolate.  The taste was what I expected from the smell, almost like a chocolate malt from your local creamery.  For a stout this was surprisingly drinkable. I could probably drink three before I felt like I ate a loaf of bread.  I was wearing a big red cat head, and in order to keep my anonymity I drank this through a straw.

Dark brown with red highlights. The creamy tan head left sheets of lace.  Smell was chocolate pudding. Grains a cocoa powder. An interesting root-beer aroma developed as it warmed. Unusual but pleasant.  Taste was rich chocolate with a nice bitter finish. Creamy milky cocoa. Just enough hops presence to prevent the sweetness from becoming cloying.  Mouthfeel was dessert-like.

A: BLACK it is! with a thick brown head.  S: CHOCOLATE... overpowering. Some roasted malts in the back and a hint of vanilla.  T: Very fatty milk chocolate. Much too intense for my likes. Roasted malts and a citrus/vanilla aftertaste.  M: Oily, medium carbonation and a light body.  D: Well, not my style at all. I like stouts were the chocolate tones comes naturally. It often takes brewers ages to get that refined taste. This is a quick shot and therefor highly unbalanced. Will not drink this again.

132,1118,rvdoorn,2.25,"Chocolate stouts, Yummy, I really had a lot of good ones from the UK, so can wait to try my first chocolate stout from the US! Shared the bottle with PapaEugene. Poured into a palm glass. The beer pours a very black color (no light comes true) with a great light-brown, fluffy head, and a very stable and sticky lacing.  Smell: Very strong (artificial) chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, some roasted malts and vanilla.  Taste: Full of cheap supermarket chocolate taste (the one that has more fat in it than cacao). Much more roasted malts present than the smell indicates. Coffee, citrus (orange). Aftertaste is bitter, dry with long lasting vanilla.  Mouthfeel: a bit fatty, thin-bodied with medium-carbonation.  Overall: This is not what I expect from a chocolate stout. I expect a balanced beer, where the chocolate taste comes from a careful an long lasting selection, optimization and combination of the correct malts which give the chocolate taste to beer. I read on the bottle that the brewers ADDED chocolate to this beer. Come on, amateurs, take your time to brew a beer with a natural chocolate taste, instead of mimicking one. Call some brewers in the UK (e.g. Sam Smith), they might be able to help you, because they have centuries of experience. This a for me a typical bigger, better faster beer....what a shame. Beer should be a natural product....",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,drez511,4.87,Poured into snifter from a 22 ounce bomber.  A: Dark black in color. Nice thick light brown foamy head. Looks great. Leaves a nice lacing on the glass as I drink it.  S: Malty Chocolate smell. Smells delicious.  T: First taste is burnt malt. The finish is bitter with a sweet Chocolate aftertaste.  M: Smooth and creamy. Medium body.  D: A very drinkable stout. I will have plenty of these stocked in my fridge for the fall. Goes great with the Milk Duds I am eating.  This is my favorite beer from Rogue out of all of them I tried. Much better then the Mocha porter that they offer.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,NittanyBeerFan,4.29,"Poured this into a Magic Hat Number 9 pint glass.  A: Lots of carbonation and the pour is difficult as a result. Had to spend a lot of time waiting for the 4-5 inches of head to subside before I could get myself a full serving poured. Opaque black with a thick dark head. As a result of the tough pour, the lacing comes in thick gobby rings around the top of the glass, subsiding to a more standard stout lacing of cascading streams of bubbles as I get closer to the bottom.  S: Bitter dark chocolate and roasted malts. Undertones of Williamette hops add a nice bitterness to this aroma. The background flavor is a sweeter malty aroma, coming through the bitterness.  T: Taste starts with a ton of dark chocolate character against the background of roasted malts. The bitterness provided by the good hopping of this beer is almost reminiscent of a RIS. The flavor moves from dark chocolate up front to a sweet milk chocolate in the finish.  M/D: Smooth and creamy feel towards the back, as the front is more biting with the higher level of carbonation. The texture is heavy and thick despite the lower alcohol content. A good one to share, this one is extremely rich, and proves to be a lot.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,yuriruley,4.13,"22 oz bottle poured into a stein.  A: very dark almost black with a thick tan head.  S: Strong chocolate smell, almost a bakers chocolate. This smell was pretty overwhelming for me, so I couldn't really smell much else.  T: Creamy chocolate with a slight bitter after taste with hints of roasted flavors, very full flavor.  M: Very full body with a nice smoothness to it, not too carbonated.  D: Goes down very smooth, would definitely buy more when I get a chance.  Notes : Over all a good brew, not the best stout I have had. But the first chocolate stout I have had. Loved the smell, which is weird because I am not huge on chocolate. Going to try it with some sort of dessert next time.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The head leaves a bubbly lacing on the sides of the glass.  The smell is all milk chocolate and roasted malts. There isn't much else to it, but the chocolate is very strong and inviting.  The taste follows the smell pretty closely, with a lot of milk chocolate and some astringent roasted coffee and dark chocolate in the finish.  The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout, but the carbonation matches the flavors well and the beer is very drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,capn,3.93,"Rogue Ales - Chocolate Stout is an American Stout style made with Northwest Harrington and Klages, Crystral 135-165, Beeston Chocolate, rolled oats, and barley malts; Cascade hops; imported Dutch bitter-sweet chocolate adjuncts; Rogue's Pacman yeast, and ""free-range coastal water"" (as opposed to the domesticated variety I guess...). It is 15 degrees Plato (a measure of the dissolved solids in beer), 69 IBU, 77 AA (Apparent Attenuation), and 135 degrees Lovibond (a measure of color mostly replaced by the Standard Reference Method {SRM}).  Rogue - Chocolate Stout poured with an opaque, ebony color that revealed ruby notes when held to a light. It had a chocolate-brown, creamy, slightly sweet head with a deep, semi-sweet to bitter-sweet chocolate nose. It had a crisp feeling on the tongue and the back of the throat that accompanied a crisp flavor of bitter-sweet chocolate and left a bitter / residual alcohol finish.  This was a good beer but not exactly what I was expecting. By no means a statement about the quality of this beer of course, just that my taste leans more toward a sweeter and chocolaty flavor in this style. Remember, taste is highly subjective!

132,1118,biboergosum,4.05,"650ml bomber. I've always liked this one, even shared it with my own mother, for heaven's sake. Time to get to a review, methinks.  This beer pours an opaque black, er, colour, with ever so slight reddish cola edges, and three fingers of puffy, thickly foamy, and billowy tan head, which leaves some continental drift map lace around the glass as it slowly sinks away.  It smells of slightly roasted caramel malt, bittersweet milk chocolate powder, cafe-au-lait, a bit of gritty indistinct graininess, and some earthy, grassy hops. The taste is surprisingly edgy dark chocolate, sweet milk solids, lightly toasted caramel malt, a touch of hard toffee, and moderately bitter leafy, weedy hops.  The carbonation is soft and generally just supportive, the body a decent medium weight, well smooth, and more than a bit creamy, those oats representing tough. It finishes off-dry, of course, the chocolate and milky essences persisting as the hops come full 'round to play in this particular confectioners' wet dream.  A nicely balanced affair, something I wasn't exactly expecting - the hops keep the pushy bittersweet chocolate in check, making for a comfortable, easy-drinking stout - provided you have a chocolate sweet tooth, that is. One of Rogue's better offerings.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A - slightly aggressive pour at first yields a huge, tan colored head. this beer with only the faintest reddish hue on the edges when held up to a bright light. head slowly dissipates over a few minutes, clinging to the side of the glass. the high point of this beer.  S - if you've ever burned brownies or hershey bars on the stove, this is the scent. offset slightly by a bit of toasted malt, very faint toffee and coffee. tried my hardest to detect any hint of alcohol in the nose but to no avail.  T - more slightly burnt chocolate. initial sweetness is balanced pretty well by the malts, and then a bit of hop bitterness at the back of the tongue...and there's the alcohol! aftertaste is more of the same, and lingers for quite awhile. as it warms, the coffee notes become a little more prevalent.  M - pretty strong carbonation, a bit too much. leaves behind a chalky kind of texture on the tongue, and the taste (though not bad) just refuses to go away. wished this was a little creamier.  D - though not really heavy, i'm half-struggling to finish all 22oz on my own. kind of tasty, but every few minutes i find myself taking another sip just to fight the overly chalky aftertaste.  Notes: i've had this beer numerous times, and can see myself being in the mood for it in the future, although not too often. wish this was a bit thicker, a little sweeter with a little less ""burnt"" taste, and in a smaller bottle.  -my first formal review on BA. was planning on doing it with a ""better"" beer, but figured I would just jump in tonight. cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smell - Louds of different chocolates - Dark chocolate/Milk Chocolate/Bitter Chocolate - Light roasted barley, coffee, some vanilla, a light yeastiness (kinda like a chocolate covered donut), and some hop character is also present. Taste - Milk Chocolate, Dark Chocolate, roasted barley, coffee, and a bit of a hop bitterness. Drinkability - an outstanding beer! a little leaner on the mouthfeel than I would have liked and a little bit more bitter than I was expecting, but this is still an exceptional brew!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,beerthulhu,4.4,"A: Poured a dark heresy chocolate bar color with a 2 finger foamy head that was cinnamon colored. The lacing was sticky and uniform leaving concentric circles for a lacing all the way down the glass walls. Head retention was good lasting a solid 3-4 minutes while a thin skim coating sits atop for the remainder of the drink.  S: The nose had a beautiful rich milky chocolate scent with an equally beautifully soft roastedness. The chocolate stands out here with an exceptional quality, dark and dry, with a rich fresh milky quality coming through. Definitly take some time and hang around here smelling all this has to offer.  T: The flavor was dark roasted barley grains with a burnt chocolate and dark hazelnut bean taste. There is a good chalkiness while a good sense of roasted oatmeal comes through for a lingering lacing that lasts well after the swallow. Roasted pine and citrus hopping contributes earthy tones that is well noted on the finish and fade. Much as the nose, the deep dark chocolate nature is the main attraction here, burnt, dry with a smoothing bitterness that is only detected upon the swallow standing out with a fierce dominance. What more is there to say about a drink that is perhaps the staple of all chocolate stouts.  M: light-medium with a slick consistency. A roasted malting and chalkiness smoothers the tongue with a full coating from back to front.  D: good, enjoyability was that much better. Even through the nature was a deep dark chocolate stout this was extremely well balanced and smooth sliding down the throat with pleasure leaving a calling card of residual burnt bitterness that will positively keep you coming back for more.

A slight creaminess and milk-chocolate syrupy-ness ensue in the aftertaste.  M: Slightly thin body; nicely carbonated.  D: A tasty and hearty ale; like a meal in a cup. Good stuff.

Appearance: Pours an earthy brown with red corners and an off whilte 1 finger crown that shows a touch of retention and lace.  Smell: Impressive amount of chocolate coupled with a bready toasty malt.  Taste: You know most chocolate beers have a dark chocolate flavor with a mild amount of bitterness. Those same beers are very similar to coffee stouts that have that same dark roast bitter quality. This brew tastes more like milk chocolate with absolutely no bitterness. Just chocolate and malt here folks. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied....seems a touch thin to me.  Drinkability: Goes down like liquid candy.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

This doesn't taste like a beer, this taste more like something out of a Hershey's syrup bottle.

Held it up to a fairly bright lamp about a foot away from me and I couldn't see reds or browns. A careful pour produces a robust, sandy colored, three-finger head with excellent retention and lacing.  Smells of dark chocolate--gasp!--and roasted malts, with a bit of hops. As it approaches cellar temperature, it acquires a milk chocolate/milk stout quality in the background, and a bit of mild rum or vanilla on the back end. Good alcohol masking.  Up front, there's bitter chocolate and roasted malt that gives way to sweet dark malts. There's a bit of bittering hops in the background as it fades to a strong, lingering espresso with an undercurrent of vanilla and caramel.  The beer is full-bodied and creamy, and the bitterness might interfere with more delicate foods, like lightly seasoned/sauced chicken or fish. Lower ABV and a complex, savorable flavor make for a great session brew. Very good drinkability for the style.  One of the top five stouts I have had the pleasure of drinking.

132,1118,ShogoKawada,3.9,"From 22oz bomber. Passed over this one countless times, now I' going back to the Rogue line to see what I've been missing This beer comes highly recomended.  A- A dark, dark, cocoa with a sandy head. This beer has a very thick, long-lasting head that isn't going anywhere. Took a few pours and about 10 minutes before I had a full glass. Looks fantastic. Decent lacing.  S- This smells like...chocolate. Surprise! I am surprised, however, at how dead-on the nose is. Like a dark chocolate bar melting in a saucepan. Really inviting, this is an amazing aroma.  T- A couple things going on here. There's a heavy malt, a bit smoky/toasted, with a moderate caramel sweetness that is quickly replaced with an exploding dark chocolate flavor. This stout is also pretty fairly hopped, but they also play second fiddle to the chocolate. The hops are there to remind you you're not drinking a hot cocoa. I really like bitter, dark chocolate, and this beer is that personified. Very good. Not great, but very good.  M- Thick, creamy, luscious, very full-bodied thanks to the heavy malt bill. This beer takes its time and lingers, with such a great flavor profile I wouldn't want it any other way. I wish there was more carbonation in this one, although the hops do a pretty good job of helping the mouthfeel stay afloat.  D- Moderate. This beer is a joy to drink but is not sessionable- for one, it's too heavy to drink a lot of, and the flavors are pretty intense despite the moderate ABV. Still, fantastic.

Appearance is rich, opaque black with a really dark brown, one finger head. Smell hits hard with notes of chocolate from the malt and the flavoring. Sweet milk chocolate and bitter dark chocolate present in equal measure. No noticable hop presence. Taste is bitter chocolate notes upfront, presented in strong measure. Some sweetness follows and offers a nice balance. Mouthfeel is medium, with a creamy finish. Drinkability in this stout is great. The chocolate flavor and the low ABV make this a highly drinkable beer. For a stout, I could have these all night. My only criticism is chocolate is the only flavor, although it provides enough complexity to stand alone.  Overall, a deliciously chocolate flavored stout. Waves of chocolate notes make this drinkable and flavorful. A nicely balanced stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bamadog,4.02,"Had this sitting around for a few months now and finally got around to drinking it a couple nights ago. Review is from notes taken on 9/14/2009. Pour is from the bottle to a tulip.  Appearance: Pours darkest brown/near black; viscous looking; comes with a big 3 finger head that is dark tan and leaves a foamy lacing down the sides of the glass and fades very slowly.  Smell: Rich and chocolatey like a hostess cupcake and is reminiscent of Southern Tier's Mokah (IMO); prersence of a slight vanilla aspect and alcohol is present in the nose as well.  Taste: Doesn't necessarily match up with the smell; does not come across nearly as rich, but more like a semi- or unsweetened chocolate and like roast espresso beans; sweetens slightly as it warms, but also a bit of an acidic, bitter hoppiness as well.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is a bit strong, I feel the body would be a bit better if it was a little weaker as the body would be a tad smoother; body is moderately thick and levaes a thick coating on the roof of the mouth.  drinkability: Moderate. Decent flavors, wish it was a tad sweeter; a bit heavy in body so it's very filling (as a stout should be), but the ABV is pretty moderate and doable, so that helps a bit.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Docer,4.15,"Had a bomber of this last night....  - Dark rich chocolate color... mild head which quickly vanished... can't see through.  - Great scent, much like the shakespear but with an excellent added light chocolate scent and hop bitterness.  - Fantastic chocolate taste, light.. crisp and especially hoppy really... bitter, and floral on the belch. Surprised actually at how hoppy it is.  - Not sticky at all, very light on the palate.  - Great brew, great taste, and wonderful drinkablility.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,nickd717,4.1,"Bomber from BevMo in Mountain View.  A - Pours jet black with a substantial creamy brown head. Looks great.  S - Lots of chocolate with some roasted malt.  T - Major chocolate taste, good but probably could have been incorporated a little more seamlessly. A little bit like Hershey's syrup was poured into a stout. Also roasted malt, earth, and some mild hops. Bitter and sweet.  M - Smooth and creamy with some rough edges and medium body for a stout.  D - Pretty high for the style.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,patjrooney,4.62,"They have this on tap at Taco Mac in Roswell, GA. It 's a great stand alone beer but I usually have one at the end of the night after I have a good IPA or porter. The aroma is is the first to hit you and then the taste is very smooth. They also have it in a large bottle but the draft is better.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,taxguyjase,5,"The Rogue Chocolate Stout is probably one of the best beers I've ever had. From first glance, the beer has a dark, rich color and the head is a frothy, creamy light chocolate brown (see the picture). The head sticks around for a while too, so you don't have to worry about blinking and it's gone. The cocoa, coffee and malt smell is really appetizing and nothing overpowers any of the scents. The best part is the taste, which has a rich dark chocolate (not really sweet) and truffle flavor. The strongest taste hits in the middle of the tongue, but it's smooth and robust at the same time. The entire beer is extremely well balanced and versitile, as a number of different types of beer drinkers would enjoy this beer. The Chocolate Stout has 69 IBUs, which surprised me as the beer wasn't all that bitter.  Oh and this beer was only $4.99 for the bomber. I ended up seeing it at Whole Paycheck Market for $5.99 and Kelly's Liquors for $6.99 (yikes!). So, if you want this beer, check it out at Quarters and save yourself a few bucks.  Appearance - 5.0/5.0 - Rich, dark color with a tasty, frothy, creamy chocolate tan head. Smell - 5.0/5.0 - Scents of cocoa, coffee, malt - rich aroma, with a little hint of alcohol Taste - 5.0/5.0 - Wow! Rich, roasted chocolate, truffle flavor; Smooth but robust flavor; Aftertaste a little bitter, almost dark chocolate tasting, everything extremely well blended Feel - 5.0/5.0 - smooth, hangs out with a nice mellow aftertaste Drinkability 5.0/5.0 - Would drink this anytime and a number of different types of beer drinkers would enjoy it too.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DavoleBomb,3.27,"Poured into a pint glass.  4.0 A: Pitch black color. Two fingers of brown head, which starts out really foamy and dies down to frothy. Good retention and lots of lacing.  4.5 S: Nose is full of bittersweet chocolate. Real chocolate, not artificial. I feel like I'm in Hershey, PA. Pretty one dimensional, but it's a good dimension.  3.0 T: Taste is a huge letdown. The burst of chocolate in the nose is nowhere as strong as I expected or would have liked. I would liken it to drinking a Coke with ice and letting all the ice melt. The diluted coke is worse than either coke or water. Thus, this beer would be better if the chocolate were ramped up or completely removed. Suprisingly bitter and much less malty than I would have expected.  2.5 M: Light body, which is the exact opposite of what I would want in a chocolate beer. A bit overly carbonated too. Not creamy at all.  2.5 D: Based on the appearance and smell I was expecting something akin to ST Choklat. The taste and mouthfeel eliminated that thought on the first sip. This is a bad beer, which could easily be salvaged by ramping up the chocolate flavors and thickening the mouthfeel.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mdquigley,4.25,"650 ml bottle poured into a 16oz pint glass. Sight: Black hole-like darkness. Tan head with large bubbles that made a full three inches on a calm pour. Excellent lacing that stuck and measured my progress better than I could.  Smell: Roasted malt with chocolate overtones. It wasn't just bitter chocolate, but truly sweet chocolate as well. This is the downright sweetest (in classic terms) beer I've ever smelled.  Taste: Dry at first, like a good stout, then the flavor swirls in your mouth and the chocolate comes rushing out. The flavor was sweet without going too far. The finish was bitter with coffee and traditional chocolate notes.  Mouthfeel: Velvety, not overly carbonated and very nice going down.  Drinkability: I drank 650 ml. and could have had more. However, such good desert beers usually follow a nice meal, and this one was no exception. But I had three glasses, so I'd rate this high as stouts go.  Overall: Very pleased with this one. As I see it, the gold standard for chocolate stouts is Young's brew. Without having a bottle of Young's Double here with me, I can't make specific comparisons, but I'd rank Rogue's concoction right up there.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,PvtVile,4.1,"The Rogue Chocolate Stout was presented in a brown bomber and poured into a Guinness beer mug.  Appearance: It pours extremely dark and forms a great big coffee colored head that takes a while to settle, and leaves lacing.  Smell: Lots of chocolate w/ hints of cream and hops.  Taste: The first taste is some nice bitter hops, and then it settles with a hint of chocolate that stays around for a while.  Feel: Coats the mouth with a buttery sensation and ends crisp and carbonated.  Notes: This is a tasty stout that I wouldn't mind enjoying after a good meal.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

It has a small sweet taste in the beginning and in the middle that is very good. I would have another bomber at some point, but one per session is enough. This is decent, but not spectacular.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,alkemy,4.1,"This poured an exceedingly dark brown color with a light brown head about an inch tall. Definitely has chocolate in the aroma along with a malty ginger bread scent. Taste was also of ginger bread, with chocolate lasting through the finish. Chocolate was somewhat bitter (semi-sweet chocolate as someone else described.) This is a pretty tasty brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,r0nyn,3.93,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a mug.  As is typical of most stouts, the look of the Chocolate Stout in the clear mug is something else as it is impossible to see through the inky blackness. Good sized initial head that dissipates into about a half inch sized frothing. Lacing really sticks to the side of the glass. Smell is a little bit malty with the titular dark chocolate aroma mixed in.  The taste surprised me a little bit at first, as I could definitely identify the bitterness first. I guess I was expecting chocolate straight away, so it took me by surprise. Once I let it swirl around a bit, however, the chocolate character made itself known. Mingled with the hoppiness and maltiness, it results in a complex flavor that finishes off like it started, with a bitter, yet smooth feel. There is a tiny lingering bitterness after the swallow that fades away after a few moments. For a stout, it's about middle-of-the-road in terms of body and the carbonation is just right, meaning it goes down pretty easily.  This is a fine beer, no doubt about that. I would have rated it higher on the drinkability scale if it were just a tad less bitter, but it's still a drink that is very easily and enjoyably imbibed.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,scootny,4.36,"A deep black brown that is impervious to light. A huge head of ridiculous staying power billows from the pour. Lace is abundant and sticky. The glass is just gorgeous.  Smell is firmly chocolated with a deep dark breaded malt base. Whatever the natural chocolate flavor is it is very aromatic and complimentary. It enhances the chocolate of the malt. Roasted notes of dark grains. A faint of hop bitterness cuts through every now and then.  Taste is the firm chocolate from the nose at first but develops into an artfully balanced dry Irish chocolate stout. Dark molasses gives a hint of sweetness. Coffee comes after the chocolate and flows into a clean Cascade hops finish. In between, the oats and barley add body and depth while stretching the malt and dark grainy core of the backbone. An earthy complexity shows itself as the coffee and hops linger. It really shows itself at cellar temperature, do not make the mistake of drinking this too cold.  Feel is silky and smooth. Carbonation is mellow but enough to keep it from turning to syrup.  Drinkability is so good. You want to session this one until you realize it is 6 percent abv. Then you think about slowing down. Then you pour another one promising yourself to go slowly.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DannyS,4.55,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a 24 oz beer mug.  A - Pours absolutely pitch black with a dark brown head that dissipates into the familiar foam collar, leaving tendrils of tan lacing as it's consumed.  S - Mmmm...chocolate. A thick, sweet aroma of cocoa liquor wafts up through my nostrils, accompanied by some coffee and toffee notes. But make no mistake; chocolate is king in this brew.  T - Chocolate, chocolate...and more chocolate. Once again, coffee and a bit of sweet milky toffee does show up, but chocolate is the star.  M - Velvety smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. The bitterness is also subdued and adds to the depth of flavor.  D - That 6% ABV and a slight bitter aftertaste prevent absolute perfection in terms of sessioning, but if you're looking for something to relax and get buzzed on after a long day, this will hit the spot.  Overall - If you're an alcoholic and a chocoholic, beware this beer, as you will get hopelessly addicted. For the rest of us who just love our beer and our chocolate, buy some of this right now; you'll be glad you did as you're sitting there in a chocolate/alcohol haze.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S - First thing that hits you is the chocalate notes. There is def some cocoa and raisins as well. T - Chocolate and coffee notes pop out and stand on your tongue. Alcohol is evident but nicely hidden. Very tasty. M - is thick but not overwhelming. Feels nice for an american stout. Could be a touch more chewy. D - is very nice. Goes down well. Nice and thick - not extremel overwhelming. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming.  Overall a very tasty and solid stout. Would def buy again.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,roadhouse,4,"22 oz. bomber into a pint glass  Pour was basically black, I didn't notice any light coming through. A nice two inch tan head formed on top and left some decent lacing down the glass.  Aroma was pretty much just of chocolate, and quite sweet at that. Nothing too impressive, it just reminded me of the Young's Double Chocolate Stout. Quite one dimensional, and while good, just not extraordinary.  The taste followed the aroma with chocolate naturally being in the lead. Again it's a bit too sweet for my tastes, more like milk chocolate, and me being a big fan of really dark chocolate. Again, no complexity kind of makes it a bit boring. It was pretty tasty though.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied, pretty creamy. Easy to drink considering the sweetness and richness.  I haven't liked many Rogue beers but this was probably one of the better ones. Mainly because the yeast strain character is more muted.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,buschbeer,4.62,I poured into a pint glass to an inch of brown head. It is dark brown/black in color. I have been looking forward to this libation for some time. It was hard looking at it in the fridge everyday.  It smells like chocolate with some roasted malts. It tastes like semi sweet chocolate. There is some bitterness and some sweetness. It is balanced nicely. This is an excellent beer. It makes a nice dessert beer or is just fine by itself. I am glad that I tried this. It was worth the wait.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,qchic,4.37,"Pours the darkest brown. Couldn't convince myself it was black, though I saw no light get through. The generous frothy head started out light brown and faded to tan (hadn't really noticed this happening with other beers). Aroma is amazing, which is stating the obvious to anyone who has had this beer. Tons of creamy chocolate, rich malts, some tang from the hops, nuts, and smoke. The hops definitely come through more in the flavor, which is dominated by bittersweet chocolate. I do crave a bigger body in this beer, but as is, I find it too easy to drink the bomber. A rather good value, so don't hesitate to grab this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ClevoPiwo,4.13,"What a nice looking beer! Rogue Chocolate Stout pours jet black and completely opaque with a big billowing tan head that doesn't seem to be going anywhere soon - looks like I'll have to drink through the foam!  The smell is very pleasant. Big, rich chocolate aromas come through as well as some earthy notes and roasted malt.  The taste is a bit different than what I expected from the smell, the bitterness of the chocolate caught me off guard. The chocolate flavor is pretty rich and bitter with a noticeable hop presence. The finish is dry and bitter and lingers on the palate.  The body is pretty light, making this a very drinkable beer that won't fill you up too fast.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Big rich chocolate taste without the sweetness. Bitter hop character, deep toasted malt, hint of coffee.  Rather thin for the style and moderately carbonated. Crisp and fresh. Slight dry finish.  Never had a more drinkable stout. The ABV and lighter body of this make it go down so easy. The crispness really quenches the pallate. Nicely done.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,dfranks,3.74,Well after seeing how good this beer was rated I decided to stop in and grab a 22oz bomber after work and was really excited to try this. Poured into class and really did notice the great chocolate smell that others commented on. Also a good dark stout. Decent size head that lasted to the end. While I did think the smell was wonderful I was left wanting in taste.  I really think Young's Double Chocolate Stout is a far better choice. If you think this is a good beer (which I did) you gotta give Young's a try.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Rooney107,4.08,"A- A dark brown pour reveals superb lacing and a solid head. Not as dark as some other stouts.  S- Notable aroma of sweet chocolate, a bit of roasted barley and light malt notes.  T- Whoa, chocolate. This might sound strange, but it reminds me of tootsie rolls. I wonder if the chocolate flavor is too dominant, and that it might be somewhat cloying. Perhaps this stout is somewhat one dimensional, or maybe it just seems that way when inevitably compared with Rogue's Shakespeare stout.  M- Not as heavy as one would expect, but a solid creamy feel that compliments the taste well.  D- Somewhat sweet, which could make it hard to drink too many. Of course, it's price keeps one from drinking too many. A solid beer overall.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Nice initial chocolate taste with a good burnt malty body with some delicious coffee flavor and the chocolate comes back strong in the aftertaste.  M. Nice medium mouthfeel, maybe a little thin. Pretty good carbonation for a stout.  D. Surprisingly smooth and very drinkable. A must try if you enjoy chocolate and beer",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kegger22,3.62,"This is a beer that does not warm up well. It was far better cold (usually not a good sign). Poured out rich, deep brown with a generous, light brown head that faded quickly. The aroma was one of the better I've had with rich chocolate dominating. The taste left something to desire. Mostly coffee and stale, bitter coffee at that. Very little of the aroma translated into taste, but some of the alcohol did and not to the beer's benefit. ChocoRogue looked oily, but ended up watery on the tongue. Like a lot of stouts, not high drinkability, but not due to a heavy, alcohol reasons. I just had Mikkeller Beer Geek Brunch Weasel last night and may be over critical of Rogue's as a result of the comparison.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

D: I just can't give a good score here, this is a beer thats good in moderation, and that's not due to the ABV. Its just to over the top chocolate rich, and the sweetness builds to a point you can't take it anymore.

S: Chocolate truffle right up front, bittersweet chocolate, chocolate malts, lots of caramel, oats, and cocoa powder. Truly chocolatey!  T: More hops than the nose suggests, more bittersweet chocolate, cocoa powder, truffles, and some bittering hops to balance this malty monster. I am surprised that 69 IBUs was able to do that!  MF/D: Medium creamy body, watery finish, dry at the end, a little high on the carbonation",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

It's not too sweet like some other chocolate beers and not very hoppy. M: It's not too thick and syrupy like you might expect after pouring it. It has a pleasant medium body and good carbonation. D: This beer is easy to drink as long as you like chocolate. It's not all that strong either so if you like stouts this is a good one to drink.

132,1118,superdedooperboy,4.24,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle with freshness date of 11/2009 into a snifter glass. ABV stated as 6.5%.  Starkly black and opaque with a rich and creamy light tan head of foam that falls away a little more quickly than anticipated but settling into a nice halo that leaves behind a few touches of lace.  Aroma screams one thing only: CHOCOLATE. Rich, delicious, delicate powdered cocoa and creamy lightly bitter dark chocolate. Dreamy.  Medium-full and velvety smooth on the palate with a lightly roasty entry into a rather bitter hoppy middle that moves forward into bittersweet dark chocolate toward the back.  Altogether balanced and producing a creamy, dessert-like quality that would serve well as the base of an ice cream float, with rich truffles, dark berries, or as a wonderful after dinner piece on its own. Not too heavy, either, and alcohol content is low enough to keep a full bottle from knocking one out for the night. Top-notch and a wonderfully well-made example of a chocolate beer. Superb.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,nomomentwasted,4.2,"Had this out of a bottle tonight with the weekly HBO Sunday lineup. Poured into a pint glass and away we go.  Appearance: Really, really dark brown-black that hardly any light escapes through. Brownish head that holds on pretty well and laces decently, but sure looks impressive on the pour.  Smell: Like a Hershey's Chocolate bar. Really rich chocolate and roasted malts with just a slight hint of hops. This beer smells much more like chocolate than the Stone 12th, but it also doesn't incorporate the oatmeal. It's all chocolate and it smells of it.  Taste: Roasted malts are upfront with chocolate powder, finishing with a nice bitterness. A little more watery than I would've liked, but not by much. Tastes a bit like Cocoa Puffs with the malty cereal texture and chocolate powder. Pleasant and tasty for sure.  Mouthfeel: Not too syrupy or harsh, and finishes relatively clean. A great desert beer, that's for sure. Had some cake with it and it paired outstanding. Malt coating wears away to drier chocolate finish that fades cleanly, definitely an interesting and enjoyable one.  Drinkability: I wouldn't have this all the time and it was a bit warm for it today, but man, great desert beer and totally will buy a few more of these to have on hand for such occasions. Not too heavy for a stout either. Definitely worth a good shot.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BeanBone,4.4,"Appearance: An intensely dark brown body with only the barest hints of brown highlights around the edges. Up top, two fingers of creamy, tan head that sticks around a long time and leaves good sheets of lacing.  Aroma: Wow, this is certainly a chocolate themed beer! The aroma profile is absolutely dominated by creamy milk chocolate that reminds me of premium chocolate powder. There's also some dark roasted malt, coffee, and faint alcohol notes to be found, but it's mostly about the chocolate in the nose.  Taste: A big dark-roasted malt profile with plenty of the chocolate powder flavors going on throughout. Certainly one of the most chocolaty beers I've ever tried. As for the Cascade hops, they certainly let their presence be known. It's sweet, and yet nicely bitter at the same time, making it a very balanced beer. The aftertaste is roasty and chocolaty with good bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and wonderfully creamy with smooth carbonation. The finish is sweet at first with the hops drying it a little as it goes on.  Drinkability: About average; you won't be pounding it like a Light Lager, but it's hardly a sipper either.  Verdict: Here's a chocolate beer that really delivers in the chocolate department. But, it's not just a one-dimensional beer though, there's enough complexity here to make this a real winner.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,abrand,4.2,"bomber poured into SN imperial pint glass. I dug this bottle out of the back of the DBF, so not sure how fresh it is.  Appearance is a deep cola syrup black with plenty of creamy tan head that lines the tumber. Nose is dominately chocolate with hints of the smell of baileys irish cream, bitter hops, and the usualy coffee stout aroma. Lots of bitter dark chocolate hits the palate. Malts and dark roasted coffee linger. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Very good chocolate stout from an always dependable brewery.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,NewGeneric,3.51,"Had this one a while back but took notes. Poured a deep brown color with foamy brown head that faded somewhat quickly and left good lacing. Smelled of chocolate, light hops, caramel, and a tinge of alcohol. Tasted like roased, toasted chocolate. Average mouthfeel, smooth but overcarbed and left the tongue a little bitter. Went down pretty easily though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

There is some major chocolate smell in there! Also some roasted malts but the chocolate completely dominates.  T - Whoa! There is some major chocolate flavor in there! It hits you right off the bat, continues through the middle, and you get a tart dark chocolate after taste. Got some toasted malts on the finish and there is a decent level of bitterness. This is just too much chocolate for me. I am not the biggest chocolate fan and really only like it is small doses and this is no small dose. Completely overwhelms the beer for me. Tastes like a great stout that someone put a bunch of cocoa powder in.  M - Very nice, exactly what I think a stout should be. A bit creamy, but not too thick, not flat but not too much carbonation. Finishes nice and smooth.  D - One bomber and I am done, feels too much like I am drinking strong chocolate milk rather than beer.  Overall, I really appreciate what Rogue has done here. They have pushed the limit and not just made a chocolate stout but an über one. Unfortunately, this just doesn't work for me. I can why so many people like it so much and it does taste like a good beer...with just too much chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Take a whiff....and there is no doubt this is a chocolate stout. A very intense Hersey's chocolate syrup smell. There is also quite a bit of coffee in the nose, as well as the typical Rogue hop bitterness.  Take a sip....chocolaty goodness! Creamy chocolate goodness cascades across my palate. This tastes like they took half a bottle of Hersey's chocolate syrup and squirted it in my bomber. It isn't all creamy fun and games though. The hops come in and kick some ass, giving it quite a bit of bitterness. Great stuff.  The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. It literally goes down like chocolate milk, with pretty much the same consistency. Excellent stuff, I'm glad I had the chance to try it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Not very sweet, but the roasted rich bittersweet character of true dark cocoa-rich chocolate. Even a light resin peeping through. Very good.  Mouthfeel very suitable: creamy and smooth.

The smell is sweet and luxurious with elegant flavours of milk chocolate and cocoa beans. Mild hints of pumpernickel and a touch of bitter hops.  The taste is a very well balanced blend of a dry and quite bitter stout and mellow smooth chocolate flavours. Lots of roasted (almost burned) malty flavours, a robust sour-bitter flavour and a slowly descending bitterness. The body is a little thin, though. The aftertaste is dry with notes of coffee, chocolate bars, some herbs and a mild clean bitterness.  The carbonation is mild, the few bubbles are fresh. The liquid is smooth.

132,1118,laituegonflable,4.63,"Pours a very imperial-level dark colour, with brown mocha head, slight tinge of brown at the very bottom of the tulip, but otherwise pitch black. Head retains to a medium crown and lacing is to die for. That is a fucking king Henry shit of a beer.  Nose is insanely chocolatey. I mean, that smells like cocoa, if I'm honest. It dominates quite comprehensively. There is a dustiness to it, or a dryness, that makes me feel like cocoa powder should be coming up my nose. Maybe a hint of bourbon as well, but what an amazing smell.  Taste is a strong, rich, bitter cocoa experience, hints of milky chocolate in the front, then a bitter, roasty cocoa character on the mid that extends its mechanical claws in my mouth to expand its deliciousness. I almost heard it say ""Go go gadget chocolate deliciousness"". There is a slight bitter roasty espresso character on the back and maybe even some hops, of all things? Hops in a beer?? That stop it from being too sweet. Instead it's just fuck hot delicious.  That is very, very, very nice. So well built. Full of flavour, just pleasant. Mouthfeel is slick, nicely full. Great and suits it so well.  I'm a big fan indeed. What a fantastic beer. I could drink that for the rest of my life.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Lerxst,4.42,"I've loved this beer for a long time and was surprised to realize I had never reviewed it. Tonight I am drinking one so here goes...  A-Pitch black goodness with a nice mocha head that fades fast and leaves a bit of lacing. A better head and lacing and this beer would be a 5 on appearance.  S-This smells delicious. Big time chocolate with some sweet malty notes.  T-Dark chocolate and roasted malt with a bitter finish. I'm loving it.  M-Medium body with the carb bite a bit too harsh for me. This should be smoother and creamier. Don't get me wrong, it is smooth and creamy, but judging by the nose and taste, the mouthfeel should be silky and it is a bit stinging.  D-I could easily drink a few of these even though it is a very filling beer.  A phenomenal dessert beer, without question. A job well done by Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,patmcd,4.32,"Poured a great deep black color, with a dark mocha head. It gav offe a great aroma of dark, bittersweet chocolate, but not overpowering. Overall, it was extremely smooth and drinkable, and it only got more flavorful and sensual as it warmed up. Will definitely pick up another soon.  Contrasting this with Southern Tier Chokolat, the chocolate flavors in this are much more subtle, and enhance the flavor of the mild-mannered stout. Meanwhile, the Chokolat kicks you in the face with powerful chocolate. I like both...a lot.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,photomike,4.11,"Pours a beautiful deep brown with an explosive, creamy tan head. Thick, soft lacing leaves lumpy rings all the way down the glass. Looks as decadent as it tastes.  Smell is appetizing, if a little unidimensional. Big time dry dark chocolate and cocoa powder. A hint of sharp espresso.  Flavor is similarly appealing, though not very complex. Dark, bitter chocolate and chocolate syrup with heavily roasted, burnt malt. Nicely dry.  Medium bodied and creamy, with appropriately understated carbonation. Oily, bitter finish.  Surprisingly drinkable for a beer I would expect to be overly rich and sweet.  I like this. Definitely one of the better Rogues I've had, but it didn't blow me away.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

T - First taste is cocoa, smokey, roasted grain & some bitterness hidden in there. Body is thinner than I expected, but I have had some steep beers recently (YuleSmith & ten fidy)  I'll let it warm a bit & see what surfaces...definite smokey aftertaste, but its blended with chocolate. Quite nice! Lacing sticks around like beach foam inside the glass.  M - Ok, not too different when warmer. Still really chocolately. Some bitterness on the front/middle of the tongue, but not as hoppy as some of Rogue's others. This is a nice chocolate stout.  D - Bottle says 69 IBU - I would guess much lower!

132,1118,LestatSabastian,4.32,This beer I tried last night is awesome. I believe it is only sold on draft in my state of Alabama. It is nearly a black beer but a slight brown hue in the light. The smell was very nice. true chocolate smell with a hint of coffee. The taste was also very drinkable. I knocked this one out fairly quick. Sweet with just the amount of bitterness to kill off alcohol taste. warm loving mouthfeel to it. I dont think texture in a brew can get much better. again this beer is very drinkable smooth finishing beer loved it. Beau of Bama,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,abar22,4.27,From notes...  Poured black (bar lighting makes this tough) with a 4 finger creamy head that left tons of lacing. The cap stayed throughout. The nose was dominated by chocolate. I could have confused this for a spiked chocolate milkshake. Hints of roasted coffee also came through. The taste picked up where the smell left off. Super chocolaty with hints of roasted coffee. The chocolate mixed with the smoothness of the malt makes you think you just took a sip of a milkshake or chocolate milk but before you know it the hops pop up to remind you this is a beer. Super creamy mouthfeel makes this a great dessert beer. One is easy to down because it is so damn good but I got the feeling it was time to move on after it was gone.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,projectflam86,4.33,A- Pours a dark amber brown color with a thick coffee colored foam head that leaves nice creamy lacing.  S- Roasted malty sweetness and tons of milk chocolate.  T- A huge rush of 'tootsie roll' chocolate flavors with lots of roasted sweetness.  M- Full bodied with ok carbonation.  D- One really easy drinking stout with a nice flavor.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ricke,3.65,"A: Pitch black with a surprisingly big, brown head that settles into great looking lacings.  S: Basically just sweet chocolate mixed with distinct yet not overly powerful roasted malts. Some chocolate syrup, chocolate powder and a faint milky note. Not bad, but certainly not very complex.  T: Very distinct flavor of sweet chocolate from start to finish. The chocolate flavors aren't that luxurious though, they taste more like cheep dark chocolate, milk chocolate and chocolate syrup. Some dark toffee. Just a hint of dark fruits (plums?). Plenty of roasted malts, not very powerful though and they certainly are overshadowed by the chocolate. In the finish coffee flavors make a fairly good attempt at balancing the sweet chocolate flavors and gives the beer somewhat of a mochaccino edge to it. Some very gentle chocolate bitterness and mild grassy hops in the finish as well, and of course more chocolate. Unfortunately, the finish came out a bit short and boring to me, nothing really takes the lead and the taste just fades away too quickly.  M Medium body, actually thinner than I had expected. Quite a lot of carbonation. However, it seems like some time in the snifter serves this one well since it gets a little rounder and and the mouthfeel gets somewhat smoother after a while.  D: A good beer, but I don't think it managed to live up to my expectations. Indeed, there is a lot of sweet chocolate flavors going on here and that's the way it should be, but it would have been nice with a little more complexity and a bigger body. Still recommended, though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,JoEBoBpr,4.52,"Poured into a Sam Adams glass.  From a 22oz. bomber.  A - Beautiful oily black liquid with a dense 1.25 in tan head with some scattered big bubbles. Retetnion is spectacular. Very appealing beer. Lacing sticks to the glass like glue.  S - Chocolate cake, really rich chocolate cake with some hints of warm alcohol and roasted malts. No discernible hops in the nose. I cant rave enoug about the smells its somehting to experience. Some hop bitterness and dryness at the end but only there. It starts with roasted malts and a coffee flavor that quickly evens out by chocolaty sweetness.  T - Some hints of roasted malts, some mild malty sweetness and mostly chocolate malts and chocolate bitterness. It reminds me of coffee with chocolate, some sort of mochaccino. Very delicious!  M - Very well cabroanted. good balance between sweet and dry bitterness. A little bit on teh watery side for me. Still very good though.  D - More than one might be a bit much.

132,1118,TeeCee,4.35,"Rogue Chocolate Stout  Quick review - dark and heavy stout with all the flavor, body, and uniquness you could ask for.  Color - in the light of the bar, this stuff is dark as the night. I have a feeling it's still a dark, dark brown in the light of day. I re-poured it to get a glimpse of the head. ALL of the head. Light brown, leaving more lace than clean glass on the walls of my pint glass as the head dissipated to about 1/4"".  Smell - a roastedness that makes me think of faded coffee with some fruit behind it (wtf?). I am expecting chocolate, but what I smell isn't the chocolate I'm expecting. Maybe I'm thinking like hot chocolate/milk chocolate.  Taste - like nothing else. It's like a rather dry coffee with added cocoa powder and something with a bitter finish that complements the chocolate perfectly, but is likely the hops. I can't taste fruit discernably, but the smoke here has clogged my nose a bit. If I take a sip with some air, I get a bit of fruit with it: maybe cherry. Cherry would be fitting.  Mouthfeel - this beer is surprisingly light in the mouth. I'd call it a medium thick at best, but I'd expect molten chocolate by the looks. A swish in the mouth lightens it up a lot, not sure if it's th CO2 or the alcohol.  Sessionable? Maybe if you're sasquatch.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,barleywinefiend,4.5,"Poured a very, very dark brown and the tannish head looked good and the chocolate smell was awesome.

Toasty rather than roasty, really inviting and complex.  t - Lots of chocolate but the dark malts are not washed out. Hops are very present throughout. A bit like a little powdered hot chocolate mix was added to a nice hoppy oatmeal stout.  m/d - Spot on for the style, slightly sticky but still easily drinkable on a cool summer evening.

132,1118,CHL,3.93,"Pours exceptionally dark brown (not quite black) from the 22 oz. bomber. Tan head, which persists around the rim indefinitely. What sets the beer's appearance apart is its extreme opaqueness.  It smells like chocolate. Not even like chocolate notes (which is what I normally mean by the term). It actually smells like a melted bar of chocolate. It makes me worry about the beer, but it's decidedly beer-like in the taste, with some complexity. Tastes like roasted grains, but has a bittersweet chocolate taste that persists well after each sip. It's smooth, creamy.  I expected a sweeter drink when I bought it, but I'm not disappointed by this brew. Drinkable, although too much would be filling.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

It is cool. Has a good carbonation. A wonderful outhfeel. The flavor is robustly chocolate. Well balanced and fresh. Has a thicker body. A real good finish and a nice aftertaste. This is a sweet drinking beer. Maybe not for everyone but very good. I like it a lot.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BrewIndy,4.14,"Picked up a 22 oz bomber of this tonight.  A: I was outside with it right after the poor and I swear it gave off a purplish tint on the bottom of my pint glass. Maybe it was the sun going down, I don't know. It was very impressive though. It pours a dark dark brown with a thick brown head that went down after a few minutes. It kept nice lacing down the glass as I went along.  S: This smells absolutely awesome! Rich chocolaty smell. I love it!  T: This didn't taste at all like what I had expected. I thought it would be fairly sweet but you can definitely taste the stout up front. Quite a bit of bitterness to it. It leaves you with a dark chocolate flavor though, especially after taking a few deep breaths.

132,1118,Onenote81,4.45,"In honor of my 1 year anniversary as a BA member, I decided to ""celebrate"" with a bomber of Chocolate stout. Here goes!  Pours a thick deep black with a wicked huge tan head on top. 10 minutes later, still there. Great retention. Beautiful lacing rings all over the glass. Nice historical reference of my sipping. Smells of powdered chocolate, cream, and more chocolate.  Mouthfeel is creamy, but a little on the spritzy side as well. This is the weakest aspect of this beer. Big chocolatey flavor all over this! They weren't kidding on the chocolate thing, were they? There's a touch of hop bitterness mixed in the middle, but the finish is the most pleasant mild cocoa flavor I've experienced. Wonderful. Wow. Why did I wait so long to pick this one up? This will be a regular dessert, celebration beer in the household from here on out...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Epicedion,4.54,"22oz bomber poured into an oversized wine glass.  A: Black. Poured a thin coffee-colored head that faded quickly. I suspect I need a more aggressive pour. Minimal lacing, but produces nice-looking fine bubbles whenever disturbed.  S: Chocolate all the way, but if you hold your mouth just right you can smell the hops behind it.  T: After the smell, I was surprised it didn't taste like chocolate. Instead, what I got was a strong hit of roasted oats and barley and then an upfront bitterness of (I assume) Cascade hops. But then, in the finish, and especially as I exhaled out my nose I got a long, heavy, dark chocolate. To be perfectly honest, I expected a very sweet beer, and that's not what I got. Except for a bit of the malt when you first take a sip, there's virtually no 'sweet' in this beer. This is a heavily hopped beer, with strong bitter flavors and maybe a bit of sour. Outstanding.  M: Medium-full, smooth, with good carbonation to keep it from being too chewy.  D: I don't know how much of this I could drink at once before wanting something lighter and crisper. But I can drink this whole bottle, easy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,sarahspat,4.15,"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Looks pitch black in the glass, but is actually dark brown with an enormous cocoa colored head. Relatively thick layers of foam stick to the sides of the glass.  Smells of chocolate of the richest variety. If you close your eyes with your nose in the glass, you might imagine yourself in a chocolate factory. The sweet chocolate notes play off of coffee to an appetizing effect.  Let's see how it tastes... not surprisingly, the chocolate flavor is huge and delicious, but it still doesn't completely dominate. Caramel and coffee make notable contributions as well. There is also crisp, bitterness for balance... maybe some floral hops flavors in there somewhere? This brew is medium-bodied and creamy.  Rogue's Chocolate Stout is easy to love and would be a good intro beer or intro stout for an inexperienced palate. I would never decline one of these.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,pants678,3.4,"Poured it into an english pint, two finger brown head and deep brown, almost black, opaque body. No light passing, not even at the edges. The head doesn't exactly maintain, but the lace is there. Looks like a stout to me.  Hard to pinpoint anything but a chocolate aroma. Defined and very deep, maybe just a hint of charred malts.  Chocolate. Again, the taste is distinct. Bitterness on the back combines with the light carbonation. Not too much of a bother, perhaps there to break up the strength of the cocoa. Not great, just what I'd expect really. Though, I must say I should have chilled this much longer.  Thick and smooth. Carbonation helps things along, really, without this might be chocolate syrup.  Should be much tougher because of the thickness, but all in all, it's alright. Not unusually easy, but not bad for a stout that I'd expect to be this heavy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Taste and Mouth Feel: While it is full bodied, it is very smooth. Very chocolate in flavor, but it is an unsweetened baking powder chocolate that has a touch of bitterness. This brew is very dry and has almost no sweetness.  Notes: This beer was not what I was expecting, but what ever is. While the natural chocolate flavor shines through, I was not overly impressed with the brew. I will note that this brew did get better as it warmed up, and I may have just gotten a bottle that was old or not well shipped.

The flavor takes that and adds in a roasted bitterness that doesn't completely blend, but works out alright. The body is a little thin, but pretty smooth. This is a really nice smelling beer, with a pretty good flavor to back it up, but the chocolate and roasted malt don't seem to gel as well as they could",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The chocolate flavor has some artificial edges but I get used to that. Some mild roasted malts are present, but it never gets sharp or burned.

Soft chocolate smell, like an Aero bar, as opposed to a thicker, darker, sweeter chocolate. Taste is creamy smooth chocolate. Again I am reminded of Aero. No bitterness, excessive sweetness or anything else off putting. Surprisingly light and smooth, I wouldn't guess this is a stout if I tried it blindfolded. Overall very delicious and the best chocolate stout I have had.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ncstateplaya,4.41,"Very nice...pours a silky black that destroys all light trying to penetrate it. A massive head forms in my imperial pint glass, very frothy and IMMENSE! The head is cookie dough in color and fills 3/4 of the glass. The head dissipates from the bottom up, creating that great cascading effect. There was abundant lacing.  The bouquet is dominated by cocoa. It smells almost like Hersey's syrup. The malt aromas carry on a long way. I have never had a chocolate malt shake, but this is what I would imagine it to smell like, extremely malty and creamy.  The tastebuds are overcome by bitter chocolate, it is very tasty. I picked up on the oats, easily reminding me of the oatmeal flavor. An initial sweetness envelopes the entire mouth and the finish is somewhat bitter, possibly a combination of the hops and dark chocolate.  I would say the mouthfeel is the only weakness of this beer for me, where I am sure others would appreciate a lighter bodied stout. It is however unbelievably smooth and velvety with very fine carbonation.  This beer goes down WAY too easy!!! Very tasty, great dark chocolate bitterness.

Had to let sit for a few minutes to even begin to sip it.  Scent was definitely sweet chocolate. First taste was a slightly dry, nicely roasted flavor. Chocolate was very prevalent.  Very coating in the mouth. Subtle if you're just looking for chocolate. More complex if you really try to taste it. Hints of coffee/espresso. Nice long finish with a mild spice at the end. almost an aftertaste of coconut for just a moment before the finish kicks in. A little bit of a dry beer.  Biggest sell was the scent. Flavor held up to it, though. A little think in the mouth.  I could definitely imagine this with a thick fudge brownie or some vanilla ice cream.

Great retention before falling to a persistent, thick cap. Moderate lacing.  S - Interesting chocolate aroma, almost identical to cocoa powder. Hints of roasted malt hide in the background but the chocolate is the main focus.  T - Soft chocolate flavors appear early on leading into a growing and sweeping bitterness. Chocolate persists throughout with roasted flavors making a moderate appearance mid to late palate. Bitterness continues to grow with undertones of earthy hops. Acrid, burnt, coffee-like flavor shines through near the end and follows long into the aftertaste with a sharp bitterness.  M - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Misses the ""smooth"" mark by a hair and takes on a bit of a dry stout feel.  D - Not my favorite beer, but not really my favorite style either. The aroma is slightly misleading. Instead of a gentle chocolate flavor atop some roastiness, Rogue offers a fairly dry and sharp stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ffejherb,4.47,"On nitro-tap at Brass Rail Deli on 4/20/09.  A - Dark chocolate brown body with a massive three-finger dense, creamy tan head that retained exceptionally well and left thick swatches of foam on the glass.  S - Rich, potent cocoa powder and semi-sweet chocolate syrup aroma that pretty much dominates the nose. A hint of caramel and toffee malt appeared as it warmed up a bit, but the aroma is essentially chocolate through and through.  T - Sweet and malty chocolate flavor that quickly segues into a more bitter character reminiscent of cocoa nibbs. A touch of earthy hop bitterness appears during the finish, but the flavor is all about decadent yet delectable chocolate.  M - Medium bodied with a smooth, creamy texture and soft nitro mouthfeel. Bitterness is steadfast and lingers on the palate for the duration.  D - This is easily one of the best smelling chocolate stouts I've come across, and this also has a pretty aggressive bitterness to boot! The nitro pour gave it a pleasantly soft and smooth mouthfeel as well. Excellent stuff from Rogue!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BarrelO,4.12,"22oz bomber poured into a pint glass.  A: Black with hints of brown around the edges. A nice tan-colored head.  S: Lots of chocolate with additional notes of roasted malts.  T: All about chocolate, but it's of the bittersweet variety. The hops and roasted malts push it further toward the bitter end of the spectrum. It's quite good, but if you're expecting an alcoholic chocolate milkshake, prepare to be disappointed.  M: Thick, creamy, carbonated, and grainy.  D: This is a good stout, but I can't recommend it as a gateway beer like some have. There's definitely an essence of chocolate, but you kind of have to work for it. I think you have to like stout at least a little to appreciate this.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,sweetbrew82,4,"P: Sits a very dark, burgundy-tinted brown with a chocolatey brown head that showed decent retention. Didn't leave as much lace as expected.  A: Bittersweet chocolate reigns supreme in the nose. Followed by roasted malts and a citrusy hop aroma deep within the aroma.  T: Nice base of roasted malts act like a springboard for the chocolatey goodness to showcase itself. It's like a milkshake, with creamy chocolate permeating throughout my skull. Nice, citrusy hop flavor gives this a west-coast feel and some much needed depth to this brew. Perfect dessert beer!  M: Medium-full bodied with a rich, somewhat slick texture to the smooth natured experience.  Notes: This would be a good chocolate stout to introduce as a gateway beer for those just getting into darker beers. Not overly sweet, but does deliver satisfaction to the sweet tooth, and also a picky craft beer drinker. Recommended",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Aenema,3.7,"Appearance - Pours a pitch black with a foamy brown head. No lacing. Smell - Cocoa, roasted malts. Taste - Roasted malts, some cocoa with a bitter hop finish. This is a well-balanced beer. Very similar to unsweetened baker's chocolate, except a milder chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with light/moderate carbonation. Light on the tongue. Drinkability - Although it has a lighter feel/body than many stouts, it remains a rich, filling drink, though does not possess the incredible flavor of some other stouts. Overall - A good stout, though I'd rather have a Peche Mortal or Choklat, unfortunately this lacks the flavor intensity of the aforementioned stouts.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

This beer pour a very dark brwon color with a thick brown head that seems to last forever. The smell is awsome, full and deep, the chocolate is definetley there, reminds me of trufles, fondue and strawberries with chocolate. Flavor has a strong hoppy character, that gives a pleasant contrast to teh aroma. As the lable states, there are hints of oatmeal, chocolate and truffle. Aftermouth is also very enjoyable.

Decent tan head that diminishes to leave nice lacing  S - Dark chocolate and perhaps slightly of oats  T - Dark chocolate, roasted malts, slight oatmeal, finishes a little bitter  M - Slight carbonation but very smooth, medium body that finishes a little watery  D - Average, this stout has a very strong flavor of dark chocolate that although pleasant would likely weigh on me if I tried to drink more than 1 bomber.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mbunje,4.19,"22oz bomber poured into a tulip glass  A - Nice dark brown color. Big full tan head, more than expected. Opaque, can't see through this one. Even the edges are brown, no red or other color.  S - Best part of this beer. It does smell like roasted bitter chocolate. Very well done. A bit a sharpness which is surprising at 6%  T - Also well done. A nice bitterness to it, like bittersweet chocolate. Has a very mild soapy aftertaste (Oatmeal?)  MF - I have to say, a bit disappointed here. This needed to be a thicker, more full bodied experience. It is medium bodied.  D - Price is right at less than $5 for a choco stout. The medium bodied nature and relatively low ABV make this very drinkable...if you want to drink a LOT of chocolate stout.  Overall a very nice effort. Smell is really great.

132,1118,stakem,4.35,"This chocolate stout was everything I had hoped it would be. Initially, the bitterness reminded me more of an imperial stout. It has a very good mouthfeel with hits of chocolate bitters. Very rich smelling chocolate sent.  On a side note, I was ackwardly surprised by a piece of what appeared to be partially melted glue stick floating in the bottle before I pourded my second glass out of the 650 ml bottle.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mizzourah,4.43,"A- Pours as black as night with a towering tan head. It also left a good amount of tan lacing.  S- Strong smell of chocolate and some roasted malts. Mostly chocolate though.  T- Chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate. There is some oats at first, but it's predominately chocolate. I also picked up a nice kick of hops at the end that balanced it out nicely.  M- It's a pretty medium bodied beer. I've had heavier stouts before, which I prefer, but this had a nice mouthfeel. I thought it was a little thin at the end, but nothing to complain about.  D- I had this beer for dessert, and I recommend it for that. It would pair nicely with a very dark chocolate, which I really wish I had on hand. It's an easy drinking beer and the ABV isn't too strong at 6%. I very much enjoyed it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,dickieb,3.96,"Pours black with an average toffee colored head and some greta lacing. The smell is of tootsie rolls chocolate and caramel malts and some light hopping. The flavor consists or bitter dark chocolate some grainy malts and a lingering hop bitterness. The mouthfell is quite thick for 6% and it is quite drinkable. This one is a classic, a good chocolate stout that is not 10%. An excellent example of the style.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bonkers,4.12,"I poured from a bomber into a standard pint glass. It pours jet black with a large tan head. The aroma is pure dark chocolate.

There's a slight backing of yeast notes and dark roasted malts.  T- Lead with big hot cocoa taste, moves on to rich toasted, and finished with bitter herbal hops.  M- Moderate viscosity, could be quite a bit more dense. Carbonation is low with a fine texture.  D- A very nice chocolate stout, which if it were just a touch more viscous could be great.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jeffthecheff,3.91,"Jet black with a cocoa colored head. Aroma is straight up chocolate. It smells like hot cocoa, only more chocolaty. This is one of those beers where all the malt and hops aromas are so hard to pick up I can't really comment on them. The flavor here has a lot more than just chocolate though. The first thing you will notice naturally is the chocolate because of the aroma. The flavors are a bit more complex, with dark malts coming through and a touch of hops in the back. Some coffee flavors also come through. I would prefer just a bit more bitterness either from hops or dark bitter malts. Mouthfeel is great, it leaves some flavor on the finish, making you want another sip, leading to great drinkability. Aroma is a bit strong which lowers the drinkability just a bit, but its still really nice.  Overall this is a great chocolate stout. After having both ST Choklat and Harpoon chocolate stout, this one is much better than both and fits perfectly between both. It isn't ""imperial"" and it doesn't have to be. It has complexity without being too strong. The price is a bit high here, of course since its Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TexIndy,2.94,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. No dating info. It was black in color with slight carb but tons of lacing. It had a very large brown head that very, very slowly settled into a thick constant foam.  The aroma was very weak. I'm battling spring allergies so even had the wife take a sniff. We both had to really swirl the glass and then breath deep to get much. What was there was good. Cocoa and coffee mainly with some milk chocolate in the back. The taste was very disappointing. Chalky with a very bitter middle and end. I like bitter but this seemed out of place and the wrong bitter if that makes sense. Also getting a lot of watery taste as well. Normally, I'd chalk this up to a bad bottle but I tried this about 6 months ago and it tasted exactly the same. I didn't review it then because I thought it was a bad bottle but now I think that it's just the way it is. I really wanted to like this one as I love the style and it's readily accessible but really didn't enjoy. After half a bottle it really became a chore to finish.  Overall, a disappointment - see above for why. Could I possibly have had 2 bad bottles? Seems unlikely but I'm way off from other reviewers that normally I find a lot in common with. Since it's Rogue, I'll give it one more chance down the road. Unless dramatic improvement, one and done.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S: literally smells like a chocolate milkshake, I try to pick out other scents and it says don't bother! Such a great nose treat.  T: very chocolatey flavor but it's more dark chocolate than milk chocolate. Can taste a slight amount of roasted malts/roast coffee once I get used to the chocolate.  M: feels full in the mouth but slightly thin/watery on the finish - I bet on a nitro tap this would be KILLER  D: easy to drink, solid flavor and no alcohol taste, so I'd say high although for me it would be higher if this were sweeter or more milk chocolate in flavor",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,witster18,4.42,"An exceptional beer. For being a beer that has a flavor 'gimmick', so to speak, this is a well-balanced and flavorful stout that isn't overpowered or off-putting in any way. The chocolate stands in the forefront with a bitter hop backbone. I think it wouldn't be a stretch to call it a world class offering. Rogue has developed a beer here that is flavor overload but still maintains incredible drinkability. My bomber left like a thin lager but also left me yearning for more. Hefty price tags with rogue now... they sent out a letter talking about prices of ingredients etc... the way I see it... you pay a world class beer price... but often you don't get a world class beer.... Not Here!... 6.50 hurts...but it hurts so good.... mmmm..mmm tasty beverage. Less Chalky than St. Ambroise Oat Stout... better mouthfeel than old #38... TO quote Arnold, ""I'll be bahck""!

More so (maybe not) than Choklat, or at least it has more beer/stout like flavor than this beer. I mean it has some wonderful toastiness that compliments an outstandingly sweet chocolaty aspect. And tastes much much bigger than the six percent would indicate. Every brewer could take a lesson in the head retention that this beer shows. A half inch cap of sandy brown froth all the way through the session. Maybe just a tad too sweet for my tastes, but I'm not really a chocolate fan and I'm still beyond impressed.

Smells of roasty bitter malts and chocolate. Plenty of bitterness in the taste, but not from hops. The bitterness is all chocolate, almost like sticking your tongue in baker's chocolate. Many think ""sweet"" when they see ""chocolate"" but don't be fooled. This beer is very chocolatey and very bitter. No sweetness here. I would rate the taste portion higher, but the residual bitterness from the dark chocolates isn't too pleasant. Its smooth and milky in the mouth and quite quaffable.  This beer is basically a Shakespeare Stout with tons of chocolate poured in.

132,1118,beerman207,3.66,This review comes from a bomber bottle. I have to start out by saying I was somewhat disappointed with the bottle versus having this on draft. My first experience with this brew was on draft where I didn't take notes on the beer but my recollection was that the beer was amazing. The bottle was a little less impnressive.  Pour resulted in a nice two fingers of head with very nice lacing. The smell of chocolate was good but not as good as the draft. The taste was bitter chocolate with a hint of coffee? This beer is as dark as the night sky which is quite impressive. Overall a really good beer but I have to recommmend the draft over the bottle.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A bit bittersweet.  M: Light but hearty. Strong alcohol taste. A certain watery quality.  D: Very good drinkability. Good balance of flavor and feel.  Deep dark ominous appearance.

The chocolate smells like a bitter sweet chocolate. A soft background scent of coffee can be detected.  Taste: Strong flavor of bitter dark chocolate with some coffee taste. Roasted malt with a smoky component as well. Chocolate dominates just like the smell and bottle promise. A long lasting bitter chocolate aftertaste is not unpleasant. A bit of a chalky part there is present as well.  Mouthfeel: For all the flavor and richness, the mouthfeel is a surprisingly medium bodied feel.

The chocolate is there in aplomb.  T - Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Indeed, the chocolate drowns out much of the complexity, and really makes this one dimensional.  M - Appropriate, given what they were going for.  D - It's acceptable in this regard, but only because it's more of a dessert item than a beer. Some will find this a good thing, but I really do not.

Just about right for a standard chocolate stout.  M: coats well but not especially thick or creamy. The head did not translate into perceived fizz. Typical solid stout but not exceptional.

While other flavors are more subtly expressed, this brew sure doesn't beat around the bush with the dark chocolate. Yum.  M--Not as thick as one might expect.

132,1118,MitchW,4.5,"A - This is by far the darkest, most opaque beer I've ever encountered. Just for kicks I turned off the lights and held a laser pointer to the other side of the mug. Nothing came through. Nothing. The head was a thick froth, akin to what you would see on the top of a good expresso.  S - Cocoa absolutely dominates. A blind smell test would overwhelmingly say that this was a high-grade, bittersweet chocolate bar... and in this case that's a very good thing.  T - A surpisingly well balanced stout with good malt base. Of course the brew has very strong chocolate overtones, but nothing about the flavor seems unbalanced. Biased towards the cocoa, yes, but the flavor just works.  M - A good chewy texture with subdued fizz that gently coats the mouth.  D - Despite the strong flavors and full texture, this is a marvelously easy beer to drink. Additionally, this beer is an absolute desert.

132,1118,argock,3.63,"Poured from 22oz brown bomber into a clear pint glass. No freshness date. Purchased from Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $5.29.  A: Beautiful Nearly black with milk chocolate brown edges and a baking German chocolate cake head, 2-3 fingers, with prodigious amounts of lace.  S: Delicious bittersweet chocolate aromas, floral hops, dark malts, and molasses.  T: Unfortunately the taste is heavier on the acrid, molasses end of the scale and less on the sweet chocolate end of the spectrum. While the acridness isn't overly harsh, it dominates the flavor from start to end and pushes out the more enjoyable flavors of bittersweet dark chocolate, floral, C-type hops, and roasted Dark malts. I get very little sense of oatmeal in the flavor. The acrid, overly bitter, under-sweet aftertaste of damp paper is not very enjoyable.  M: The feel is pretty chewy in the long-run, but feels surprisingly light to the risk of being thin. The carbonation is good.  D: An up-and-down beer with good looks but not a balanced enough flavor which could be served by more body and a toned down acrid character.

Roasted malts round out the mid-flavor, but chocolate pulls through again for a strongly sweet finish with a little kick of coffee. Very light alcohol presence. Overall, it's cloying, like drinking a melted Hershey's bar.  M: Full-bodied with medium carbonation. Very smooth, sticky, and coats the mouth heavily. This syrupiness is the beer's downfall after 10oz or so.  D: A solid chocolate stout -- delivers the mouthfeel and impressive presence. However, it lacks staying power. It's just too sweet to drink more than one 12ozer, and this bomber is hard to finish beyond the halfway point. I enjoyed it at first, but by the end I was completely sick of it and I never want to have it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,FLBeerGuy,2.8,"Poured a midnight black with a nice creamy mocha head. Very nice lacing that lingered as I drank it down.  Smell is pure chocolate, rather heavenly, but nothing else.  Taste is overpowering chocolate and some maltiness. Way too much chocolate in this for me. I do love chocolate stouts (Youngs & Brooklyn my favorites), but this one is like drinking a chocolate malt, doesn't taste like a beer.  I split a bomber with my friend & we both could barely finish our half, not very drinkable.  A rather disappointing chocolate stout from Rogue",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,CityBoy1986,4.18,"Poured into a pint glass from a bomber.  The pour is almost black with two fingers' worth of brown head. Retention is nice, as is lacing.  The nose is (as expected) mostly chocolate with some hints of mocha and dark fruits. The taste is more of the same, and there is a bit of burntness present in the aftertaste. Some mild bitterness is there throughout.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a bit of carbonation, maybe a little too much. Drinkability was good. I can see the rating rising with food.  This is a very solid stout that is worth a visit every once in a while.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,theBubba,2.95,"Poured from a 650 ML bottle into a brandy snifter, this beer presented itself well. A deep dark burnt umber with a very decent mocha colored head that to some degree lingered to the end. Aroma of chocolate...period. The smell was pure chocolate and lacked the other nuances of a typically well done chocolate stout. Stir in a spoonful of dark coco into your next porter or stout and you'll get the idea. The taste was, frankly, disappointing. An unpleasant bitterness lingered after each sip. Once you get past the chocolate, you're kind of drinking a Guinness with a little more body. Whether this bitterness comes from bakers chocolate or a big shot of hops...or both, I couldn't tell. But to my palate, this stuff is unpleasant. The bitter aftertaste lasts until you brush your teeth. From previous reviews, I expected better. I'll take a Young's Double Chocolate, thank you.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,brandoneast,4.57,"Pourd inky transparent black tan head. Aroma of licorice, baker's cocoa, sugar cookie, red fruit.

132,1118,yourefragile,4.2,"on tap at Canal St in Reading  Pours a dark, opaque milk chocolate color with a creamy, dark tan head that leaves sticky lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma is rich and sweet like cocoa, milk chocolate, maybe a little coffee. Like aroma, huge sweet milk chocolate taste, cocoa powder, etc. Slight roast bitterness in finish. Medium bodied, but very creamy. A very nice dessert beer, and very pleasant with the low alcohol (comparable to other stouts). Chocolate is the most dominant flavor, but never out of control or overpowering.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,LoRezDave,3.7,"Wow the high marks by prior reviewers really surprises me on this one.  Apperance - the beer pours nearly completely black with just a slight brown rim. The head is brown and lumpy and reminds me of lumpy mashed potatos and gravy. Weird huh. Prolly just me. Medium bubbles, nice retention. As I drink it the beer seems to want to lace but not really.  Aroma - very prominent sweet chocolate aroma, some dark fruit.  Taste - huge taste of roasted chocolate malts and coffee. More dark fruit in the taste. Taste and aroma very similar.  Moutfeel - a bit thin, and a metallic aftertaste (?!)  So I started this sampling waaay too cold. Rookie move. Very interesting how it really opened up as it warmed. Specifically the aroma went from almost nothing to chocolaty plums. The taste opened up too (not as surprising) and the mouthfeel became less thin. Even after it warms it's only a B+ for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,dasenebler,4.25,"Nice pour, totally opaque black. Beautiful tan head, lacing. Sweet, sweet aroma of chocolate, honey and some molasses.  Taste is also excellent. I feel like chocolate beers can be very overdone, but Rogue strikes a great balance here. The healthy bitterness of this beer definitely contributes to that balance. Malty, not overly sweet as the aroma may suggest. Tons of dark, bittersweet chocolate. Usually I get more coffee with these types of stouts, but here the chocolate is actually an ingredient. Tasty, but the mouthfeel was not as chewy and coating as I wanted it to be. Occasionally the flavor is a little too syrupy-chocolatey, but overall it's very good. Very drinkable for a stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,HatTrick,3.3,"A: Was a very nice and typical black with a creamy head. Reduced down quickly to a very thin fingernail.  S: Smelled like coffee, chocolate, and cloves.  T: Really strong chocolate - very bitter. Mild coffee flavor, weak on the malts. The bitter chocolate was very over-powering and kinda killed the normally yummy malts.  M: Was good mouthfeel for a stout. I liked the thickness of it.  D: Was pretty good with food. Wasn't that fantastic by itself.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ocelot2500,4.3,"Pours a black that lets no light escape. Gives rise to a mocha colored head that is retained fairly well. Plenty of lacing on the glass.  Smells like chocolate, roasted malt, and some coffee.  The first taste to hit the tongue is the roasted coffee mixed with the chocolate. Not as sweet as I expected from the nose, but it is rounded out by hop bitterness. This beer is very balanced when I was expecting it to taste like a frappucino.  The mouthfeel is a little thick. Not quite chewy, but fairly viscous.  This is very drinkable. I find the tastes to balance and if you pace yourself it does not take up too much room in the stomach.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,tjthresh,3.26,"22 ounce bottle. Almost opaque black with a lasting frothy light brown head. Nice looking. Pretty light on the aroma side. The chocolate comes of like obvious extract to me. Theres some slight coffee, and a good punch of hops in the flavor. Palate is okay. easy to drink. Not something I'd want to drink again though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ritzkiss,4.71,"Poured from the bottle deep and black like the starless night. Two fingers of malty head. Whoah, this looks great!  Nothing jumps out on the smell, malts, a hint of chocolate like you would expect.  Taste is great, it just sings in your mouth. Lots of roasted malts and even more chocolate, oats, a hint of espresso. Good carbonation helps it spring through the mouth giving you a wide array of flavors. As it warm, it mellows out and the smooth chocolate gives way.  Wow, this is some beer. Super drinkable, complex as the best women always are, at 6% you could have a couple. I have got to go get a couple more of these.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Duhast500,4.85,"Poured into a pint glass from a 1pt. 6oz. bottle.  The color is a complete dark black, with a light brown foamy head which sticks to the glass.  The smell is of sweet chocolate. Smells like a chocolate bar of a Hersey kiss.  The taste is very chocolate. Tastes like a Mr. Goodbar, some nutty flavor mixed in with the creamy chocolate.  This is one of the very best stouts I have had. It may be the best stout. It is really easy drinking and very tasty. It also has just enough bitter hops taste to remind you it is a stout. This would make for a very good after dinner beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,biegaman,4.59,"Rogue Chocolate Stout looks like liquid chocolate - and a good quality dark chocolate at that. A staunch and secure graphite black body with slender cocoa dusted outline that gallantly unravels itself along the trim. Although inflexibly opaque, the beer is underlined by a very faint beacon of scarlet. A steadfast stream of carbonation continues to amplify what was originally a modest sized almond coloured topping.  This is the kind of smell I wish would stick to my clothes all day. Alluringly bittersweet, it coddles the nose with notes of decadently rich dark chocolate and tropically citric hops. I could also imagine shots of fresh pulled espresso and various nuts (brasil nut, almond, hazelnut) but the coffee would be steeped in hops and the nuts covered in chocolate. Anything this chocolaty *and* this hoppy deserves nothing less than a perfect score.  Heavy roasted cereal grains and sweltered oats meld perfectly with the leafy, highly citric tang of hops. Right on cue a wave of dark chocolate truffles sweep over the palate and settle onto the palate for a long lingering stay. Just when you think the flowery, spicy and citrus character of the hops will overwhelm, right on cue, that graceful finish of dark bittersweet chocolate ushers itself in. In a word: delicious.  Rogue uses both chocolate malt and some kind of 'natural' chocolate flavouring. What ever combination of the two and whatever kind of 'flavouring' (syrup? powder?) it works fantastic. The taste of unrefined cocoa, dark chocolate bars, and gooey baked brownies all show face at one point of another. The essence of chocolate - dry, bitter, rich - is always present.  Of course a number of other flavours are too. I'm tasting primarily chocolate and zesty Cascade hops probably because I'm choosing to, but flavours similar to a mocha latte, sponge cake, custard, creme brulee, whipped cream topped black forest cake, toffee wafers and chocolate chip cookies are all subject to interpretation. The fact of the matter is: if it makes a good dessert, you'll probably taste it at some point.  Rogue's Chocolate Stout is probably best consumed fresh, although I prefer it with a little tiny bit of age (1 year or so). I've found the beer - in typical West Coast USA fashion - to simply be a little too hoppy for its own good when fresh. The tanginess, citrus, and florals of a generous addition of Cascades go well with the decadent chocolate profile but overwhelm it a little at a young age. This is just my personal preference mind you...  An opinion which most would share, however, is that Rogue Chocolate Stout is a titillating beer. It marries roast, chocolate and hops in a delicious, decadent and balanced manner. This should be a staple in the beer fridge of anyone who enjoys stouts, chocolate, or dessert. This Oregon brewery makes some wonderful beers and this particular one still has to be top on my list of favourites. Recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Vendetta,3.83,"Pours a deep black with a big, foamy head. Head dissipates quickly, leaves a medium lasting head that eventually fades.  Cold, it has an astringent alcohol aroma. After it warms it displays more of the chocolate and malt in the nose.  Taste is very chocolaty, no real alcoholic presence, which is good. It is full bodied, but there's also a sense of being watered down. Might just be my imagination, but there's a distinct lack of flavor at the end of this beer, right before the smokiness hits on the finish.  This is actually fairly drinkable, a very good stout to demo to non-craft beer drinkers to get their taste acquainted to a stout.  This isn't a kicking stout, but that isn't necessarily bad. Still, I've had better in the past.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Brew33,4.03,"Picked up a Bomber of this at Jungle Jims.  Pours a pitch black with a 1 finger puffy tan head. The smell is all chocolate and some roasted malts.  The taste is CHOCOLATE!!!! Wow. The bittersweet chocolate notes in this beer are very strong. Smooth beer, not too sweet, slight smokiness. Good beer.  The drinkability for me was low due to the over the top chocolate flavor and heavy body. I managed to knock out a bomber in about 1 hour playing cards. Very tasty brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Jeffo,4.33,"Picked this up at De Koning in Amsterdam.  From a bomber into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a thick creamy two-finger tan head. Color is pretty much pitch black and tar like. Head slowly dissipates into a decent film cap and leaves some immediate lacing. Good film stays and leaves lacing the whole way down. Very appealing.  SMELL: A strong scent of chocolate right off the bat. Roasted and smoky barley malt is there as well, but it's all about the chocolate. It's a little one dimensional, but that's what it's supposed to be I guess.  TASTE: A strong bitter pure chocolate and coffee taste. Some roasted barley malt and a smoky component as well, but chocolate dominates just like the nose and bottle advertise. A long lasting bitter chocolate aftertaste is nice, and a bit of a chalky part there too. Alcohol is not noticeable until the very end. Very enjoyable.  PALATE: Thicker body, medium-high carbonation, and quite creamy smooth on the palate. Goes down smooth and is relatively sticky, coating the mouth.  OVERALL: An excellent chocolate stout that definitely delivers. Drinkable and enjoyable, but it would be hard to drink more than a couple glasses before having to move on to something else. Highly recommended and I'll be getting more next time I see it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Cyberkedi,4.43,"Pours a dark, opaque, chocolaty brown with a thick tan head. Rich aroma is chocolaty and has just a hint of smoke or roast coffee.

Silky smooth texture leaves a nice aftertaste of unsweet chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,drtth,4,"Poured from a 6 month old 22 oz bomber into Samuel Smith pint glass and allowed to warm for a while and over the course of the tasting. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: Pours a deep dark brown with hint of reddish brown in bottom of the glass shown by reflected light from the table lamp. Head is thick and light brown. Coats the side when drinking and loads of fine bubbles persist. A think layer lasts and lasts.  Smell: Aroma dominated by bitter dark chocolate, but is clean and fresh with a hint of milky sweetness.  Taste: Robust taste is of bitter dark chocolate with a hint of something burnt but not unpleasant. As the beer warms more the sweetness becomes more pronounced. So well balanced its hard to detect the hops except that there is a hint of tartness there not from the chocolate or the malts. The after-taste seems to keep going on and on, but becomes mildly unpleasant after a while.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and medium bodied. Gentle carbonation persists for most of the drinking of the beer.  Drinkability: This beer would be great with chocolate dessert or could be dessert all by itself. But given the mildly unpleasant aftertaste I'd probably not drink a second or third in one sitting.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TheFightfan1,4.5,I had this at Isaac Newton's in Newtown PA.Poured from a bottle into a PILSNER GLASS ??? Again I am as befuddled as you are. Pours black with a coffee colored creamy heading. Smell is crazy with chocolate and barley. Taste is not much different with overpowering chocolate that balances very well. The easiest stout to drink and by far the best so far. I can't say much more about this but if you want chocolate ecstasy you got it.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,number1bum,4.62,"Pours black in color, not quite completely opaque at the edges but close. Dense and creamy tan head fills the pint glass, settles slowly and leaves a rocky and pretty full lace. Leaves a ton of stick, a real mess, all over the sides. Nice.  Smell is full of semi-sweet milk chocolate, with a nice sweetness but also some more bitter dark chocolate. Very nice and not at all artificial smelling. There is a hint of roasted malt in the nose as well. Quite impressive, and better than the over the top Hershey's chocolate syrup-like nose of ST Choklat.  Taste, too, has a wonderful semi-sweet chocolate flavor. Some dark chocolate bitterness is there along with some roasted malt, but so is some milk chocolate sweetness. There is a bit of hop flavor in the back end, with some citrus and pine, but the chocolate is running the show here. Some bitter dark chocolate lingers in the finish with some hop bitterness and pine.  Mouthfeel is a smooth and creamy medium body and this is extremely drinkable.  This is much more balanced and just plain better than any other chocolate beer I've had (especially you, ST Choklat). A truly exceptional beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,cameraman,4.62,"Pours a dark brown to black color, with a ton creamy head on top. The head is two inches high and shows tremendous retention, lacing slowly down the glass. The sweet scent of chocolate is apparent with a malty sweetness as well. A touch of grassiness at the end of each scent. The chocolate and malt combine to make an assault on the taste buds, being very dominant. Then it gradually blending to a grapefruit bitterness, that is not to overbearing at the end. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky, with a syrupy clingingness at the end. This maybe a beer for breakfast. WOW! This stout brings the flavor, great aroma, and a silky feel, plus it goes well with chocolate cake.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Bootscraper,4.32,"This received the most votes in a thread about chocolate stout in another online forum, so I had to pick this up as soon as I discovered my local super market actually carried this. Served at about 50 degrees F in pint glass listening to Cattle Decapitation's ""The Harvest Floor"". This beer is motor oil black, and completely opaque. The pour created a pillowy light-brown head about 2 inches thick that did not disappear until I was halfway down the glass. There was a adequate amount of very sticky lacing as well. Also, on the pour path in my bottle and in the bottom of my glass, there actually was powdery chocolate residue left over. The smell was very robust of cocoa or dark chocolate. Very inviting! This was backed in larger whiffs by a slight ""steely"" scent of hops & hint of alcohol. The flavor started off kinda malty sweet (which surprised me for being a Stout and all), and blended right into a pure dark chocolate taste that snow-balled in momentum towards the finish, and peaked in a moderately-lengthy aftertaste. There was also flavors of tangy hops (this was especially present in burps that served as pleasant interruptions to all that chocolate). It was medium-bodied. And again, this surprisingly was not your typical dry-ass stout... the fact that is was just a bit malty lent some sticky properties to the mouth-feel, which I enjoyed. Low-carbonation levels too, this kicked ass. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who loves really dark chocolate. I am not one of said people though, so I personally will not be purchasing this again, but this beer definitely hits what it aims for.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,CHADMC3,4.43,"Pours a dark brown to virtually black with an aggressive, big chocolaty brown head erupting from the body and eventually giving way to a slight lace. I am expecting big things from this enormously bodied brew.  The chocolate malt floats from the glass, with subtle hints of woody hops and other roasted elements.  Wow, this is like drinking a roasted Hershey's bar, excellent flavor! Big character, but nothing overpowering. Dominant chocolate malt, sweet, slightly burnt oats and balanced in the finish.  Robust body, massive flavor, equally energetic carbonation, creamy and warming.  Excellent all around, I could sip on this Stout all night.

More chocolate aroma than any hot chocolate or chocolate milk I've ever had.  T- Starts with sweetness and transitions quickly into bittersweet chocolate. Some coffee/roasty notes in the finish. Sweetness is well-balanced.  M- Thinner than many stouts, with moderate carbonation.  D- The only thing that prevents me from drinking this beer at all times is the price.

132,1118,Spikester,4.33,Black with a small brown head and good amount of lacings. Smell is chocolate fudge cake. Taste is rich bitter chocolate with hints of coffee and a full bitter medium dry finish. Mouthfeel is just the right amount of carbonation.

132,1118,Tolann,4.22,"A - Poured super black into my globe glass. I didn't get much of a head out of the pour, but it was an almost coffee roast color. Not even a glow is getting though the darkness of this beer.  S - Real chocolate! Some bitter notes. Sweet and not a fake chocolate wanna be. Some dark fruit sweetness and brown sugar. Big time chocolate like a double chocolate cake fresh out of the oven.  T - Sweet and bitterness in the sip. Chocolate hangs on your breath for you to relish in. Bitter chocolate really lingers. Not overly sweet that it would sour your stomach, but something you can really enjoy and you want to sip again.  M - Some sharper carbonation and a little lighter feel than I was anticipating but still a medium mouth feel. I really like the bit of aftertaste. I think that and the nose is where the biggest characteristics shine.  D - I'm not sharing this bottle! I'm not sure why I haven't had this one more often. Very good chocolate stout.

Aroma is of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, brown sugared darker fruits, with a nice hint of hops in the background. The chocolate smells like the real thing, it's great. Smells like a freshly baked chocolate cake.  Taste is extremely complex and just great. Milk & dark chocolate mixed very well with roasted coffee notes and malts. Smoke, with a tinge of hop bitterness in the finish. The sugary fruits come through somewhere in the middle, just great.  Mouthfeel is rich, thick and creamy. Almost milky. Medium to full bodied. Has a flat feel to it though due to the lack of carbonation. Nothing that hurts the brew too much, though. Drinkability is great, as this is definitely a top notch chocolate stout.

Finish is similar to a 70% dark chocolate bar. Bitter but not harsh. There is a slight hint of hops which helps to clean the palate. Slightly dry. Not overly carbonated, very full flavors.

132,1118,Stimack,3.93,"Picked this brew up the other day, I was not sure what to think based on the amount of chocolate flavor that I figured would be there. The brew poured to a black color with a thick lighter brown head that had great retention and lacing. The aroma was dominated by the chocolate aroma, bittersweet. Also adding to the bitterness was the hops, with 60+ IBUs I figure that this would add to that perceived aroma? Also was a mild aroma of coffee and slightly burnt grains. The taste was dominated by the same bittersweet chocolate that was picked up on the nose, but also there was a nice malt flavor that seemed to add a dryness. That dryness was mixed with an ample hop presence at the tail. I feel that the flavors of this brew where good, it (bomber bottle) was just to much for me. The flavors just seemed to get to me after a while. I made my way through it but it took time and at the end some effort. The feel was a little syrupy with adequate carbonation. This brew is clearly worth trying and probably would be great going along with a chocolate type dessert. For me I would clearly rather have the Shakespeare Stout from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Chocolate is first and foremost in the odor of this one.  T - Yep... that's chocolate. A nice milk-chocolate flavor with some coffee notes. Finishes dry and bitter, which is a good complement to the chocolate sweetness up front.  M - Exceptionally smooth and creamy. Moderate carbonation helps balance out the smoothness and give it a bit of ""bite.""  D - Very drinkable. Quite smooth and well-balanced. An excellent example of how to blend chocolate and stout.  Overall: The one thing that would keep me from enjoying this often is that the chocolate flavors dominate.

Dark chocolate, coffee bean, even caramel, touches of plum or cherry fruit, even you can zen out, a nicely bitter hoppiness appears. In the mouth it's full-bodied yet in no way heavy, nimble as it has some serious carbonation to keep it from sinking too too deeply. Sure, unsweetened chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, it delivers what the label says. And, as the nose subtly suggests, there's some hoppy spine here as well, not all about the sweetness. Moderate length on finish, as if crafted to be so. No noticeable flaws.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Shared with my girlfriend, who said ""whoa, this smells like chocolate, but not the usual fake chocolate that most beers smell like, but real chocolate"".  Well, it does smell like chocolate. ""real chocolate"". It actually smells like powdered chocolate, and tastes like it also. It's a little funky with a grassy odor.  Tastes great. Yes, chocalatey, but surprisingly well balanced. It seems like the chocolate is replacing the malt, yet it's perfectly balanced with the bitterness of the hops. The bottle claims 69 IBU's, and it's believable.

Outstanding.  m- silky smooth and a little bit chewy. there is almost no bite to this beer, but it doesn't need it.  d- what can I say? this is a heavy, rich, dark chocolate dessert kind of beer with an immense and complex flavor. Holy crap is it good, but if you're like me you'll likely feel pretty full (in a good way!) after one bottle of this. Unless you're sharing, of course, but... share? really?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TLove,4.28,"One of the best winter stouts I have had to date. The complexity is there, the flavor is there, and the taste is therre.  Appearance is very dark brown. Looks like motor oil in the glass but, as pouring, has a very murky quality to it.  Smell is very complex. The chocolate is there, but one has to search beneath the roasted oats, the tumeric and nutmeg, and the bitterness of mature hops to get at it.  The taste is very very good. The longer it sits in the mouth, the more the flavors mix, roll, and come out. The spices, the sweetness of brown sugar, light smoked meats, the bitter dark chocolate, and the round oats combine for an incredible flavor.  Very drinkable. Heavy, but the finish is just as complex and full as the rest of the beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,coldmeat23,4.31,"GLASS: Young's Imperial Pint Glass TEMP: Cellared @ approx 50 degrees  Pours black. Actually, it appears to be such a deep dark brown that light will not penetrate it. Three-finger head of dense light brown colored foam. Excellent retention and massive lacing. Probably some of the best lacing that I've ever seen, at this point.  The chocolate really stands out, in this one. It brings a big toasted maltiness with it. Nice roasted coffee notes. Hints of vanilla and caramel. A little bit of smoke.  The chocolate is still big hare, like in the nose. The coffee stands up next to it, though, to give it some balance. Big roasted malts. Not much hop presence, at all. Just a touch of vanilla cream.  Good medium body, here. Not quite full. Just a touch too waterey, for me. Would like it to be a touch creamier.  Very tasty brew, all-in-all. Nice stout with some good chocolate flavor. Very drinkable. Would be good for a cool night. With the economical pricing of Rogue beers, this would be a great one to have on hand, most of the time.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,charliedango,4.78,"This is the only other chocolate stout I put in the same category with Young's Double Chocolate Stout as the best chocolate stouts available. Pure drinking delight and in a way almost too seductive in nature. Heavy mouthfeel that's light on carbonation and overflowing with a rich, dark chocolate flavor. Not too bitter with a strict stout aftertaste. I'd say the Rogue Chocolate Stout offering is slightly sweeter than Young's which is the only thing I feel sets these two apart. All in all a great stout and one that I anticipate drinking again (next time I hit the Brewhaus!)",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,brewintheLou,4.18,"Pours basically black with a frothy tannish head that sticks around and leaves a heavy lacing. Leaves a nice foam mustache.  Smell is chocolate with some toasty malt.  Taste starts off very heavy and creamy smooth. Has a creamy chocolate in the beginning and a dark chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is heavy, creamy and chewy. Goes down very smooth and not too sweet or too much roastiness, so it doesn't get old fast.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Dark brown/black body tinged with lighter brown at the ends when held up to light, otherwise opaque. Adequate lacing.  Aroma is of dark chocolate/brownies.  Taste is of unsweetened chocolate. Either there was a slight hop bite/bitterness or all the bitterness was coming from the roasted malts and cocoa; in either case it was very well balanced.  Thick mouthfeel, slightly bitter dark chocolate aftertaste that didn't cling to the palate.  Good drinkability, doesn't get cloying. A pretty decent offering from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,sonicdescent,4.2,"Pours a black with one finger thick mocha head. Turns into a crown with light lacing.  Smell is like Hershey chocolate syrup. Unfortunately thats all there is there.  Taste is very nicely balanced, not overly chocolate like the smell could lead you to believe. Starts off sweet chocolate milk, takes a brief bitter turn, and ends with dark bitter chocolate.  Medium bodied and medium carbonated, nice mouth coating feeling.  Easy and good to drink, would buy again in a second. Very nice.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BeenJammin,4.43,Rogue's Chocolate Stout pours a sturdy black with a lovely foamy tan head. The nose is filled with chocolate and roasty aromas with a few sweet and toffee-like notes to it as well. Aside from the obvious chocolate in the flavor there is also a great coffee and cream flavor in there as well. There is also a nice bitterness to it as well from the hops. The mouth fell is nice and thick and it is so smooth going down. I think I will try my first ice cream beer float with this beer.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mattffrost,4.08,Bottle poured into glass.  Appearance Beer is a vey dark brown with a tan head. Carbonation is very low.  Smell A very faint chocolate smell. A bit of coffee. Not a lot of others smells I get.  Taste Very mild chocolate taste with hints of coffee. Not a sweet nor bitter beer. Not bitter finish really. Very low carbonation with the non bitter finish makes a very mild beer. Its a nice beer.  Mouthful low carbonation mild chocolate beer that i s nice.  Drinkability A good beer for the winter. Not by favorite type of beer but a good choice for this category.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Roasted malts but mostly the is dominated by a sweet chocolate aroma.  In the taste the the roasted malts give off more of a dark chocolate taste that dominates with some sweet chocolate hiding behind the dark chocolate. You can also detect the distinct hops that Rogue uses behind the strong chocolate taste.  Not the best chocolate stout that I have had, that would go to ST but still a nice stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,kbnooshay,3.65,"Wow this is gorgeous! Poured black with only the slightest red highlight visible when held up to light. The head is massive and foamy AND frothy. This head is one of the brownest i have seen to date maybe only lighter to TEN fidy. Nice vertical streaks of lacing. Aroma to me is mostly reminiscent of tootsie rolls. It dominates! Milk chocolate and super malty flavors are also strong. In the taste, the milk chocolate flavor becomes dry and more like a bitter belgian chocolate. There is alot of hop bitterness up front also that i didn't smell at all in the nose. Roasted malt flavor is also detectable. Feel is creamy to the touch but overall the body is a tad light. There is a crispiness from the carbonation.  Overall this tastes like a tootsie roll; a candy I am not fond of. I do enjoy the beer but as a chocolate stout it isn't one of my top faves.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,popery,4.63,"Delicious chocolate stout. I have not been the biggest fan of some chocolate- and coffee-flavored beers, but this one really nails the balance of flavors, never tastes artificial and still has a sweet, dessert-like flavor. The beer looks just phenomenal. It's a rich black. If you hold something colored matte black to it, you can see the faintest shade of brown, giving body to the utter blackness. The beer is entirely opaque, as far as I can tell with a wide glass and a strong light source. The head is thick and rich and leaves wonderful sticky lacing. The beer smells like expensive cocoa powder mixed with cacao nibs and a dash of roasted coffee beans. The flavor is wonderful. The chocolate is perfectly used. The beer isn't too sweet or too chocolatey. There are good mineral and earthy hop notes. The malt backbone is big and strong. It's an enormous flavor for a stout that clocks in at a mere 6% abv, a trifling amount compared to some of the Imperial versions. The lush, creamy feel is the finishing touch. This beer and Rogue's Shakespeare Stout are both such incredible stouts. They're among the best of all stouts, regardless of size, and remain affordable amongst the increasing prices of micro-brewed beers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Vengeance526,4.5,"22 oz. bomber...  Pours to a dark, completely opaque color with a 1 finger tan head that leaves some nice lacing.  As for the smell, well what else can really be said here but roasted chocolate. Some roasted malt in the background.  A definite taste of chocolate that comes through especially well if you breathe through your nose a bit while sipping. A faint sweetness but nothing overpowering. Also some hints of coffee and hops in the aftertaste.  This is an extremely smooth beer that goes down easy and something I could easily have a few of throughout the night. Reviewed this a week after the Sam Adams Chocolate Bock (which I did enjoy for the most part) but personally there's no competition here, Rogue wins this battle hands down. More smooth and full flavored at less than half the price. Not a beer to pass up if you haven't tried it yet.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,talkinghatrack,2.41,"I'll start with saying that maybe this one just isn't in my wheelhouse.  I picked up a bottle of RCS because of its high rating here. I'm not impressed. The ""chocolate"" is a stretch. It's not in the flavor, and at best maybe my breath smells a little like Kaluha. Once it warms up I guess it smells like a chocolate syrup a little.  The poured head is great - huge and almost as thick as whipped cream. Neat effect.  The beer? Rouge's Coffee Grounds Stout might be a better name. Some folks must be into that flavor. For me, no thanks. If you're going to drink it, let it come closer to room temperature first. I found it more tolerable that way. Thin body that I wouldn't expect from such a dark, frothy brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Gmann,4.12,"Pours black in color with an average light brown head that dissipated into a light ring. The aroma is big and chocolatey, some stale coffee, and a hint of hops in the end. The taste is of bitter chocolate, roasted malt, hard water and a touch of grains. The stout has a moderate body, lighter than expected, soft carbonation and finishes bitter. A nice bitter chocolate stout, great aroma and good flavor.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S: Pretty much all chocolate, but what do you expect really?  T: Wow. Some faint coffee flavors up front and then a wallop of chocolate hits you in the mouth and doesn't go away. The flavor is not cloying, but tastes natural (as the label says) and fits the beer almost perfectly.  M: Not a sturdy beer by any means, but not water either. Just about right for a stout. Rather crisp on the finish.  D: The flavors in this beer just make you want to keep coming back for more. A great American beer and perfect for the winter months.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S - Roasty malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, bit of perfumy hops. T - I don't know where to start. Roasty malt with notes of very high end chocolate, and espresso followed by a nicely balanced, slightly floralperfumy hops. Extremely pleasant aftertaste of Belgian chocolate. M - Full, thick and velvety. Lightly carbonated. D - This is the first brew to which I've given straight 5's. Everything about it is spot on. Perfect balance of malt, hops and chocolate flavor. What makes it even better is that it's very affordable. I paid less that $5.00 for the bottle. Try it!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,AdmiralDiaz,4.48,"A: One of the most impressive features of the chocolate stout was the thick and long lasting head. It produced a head close to an inch think that stuck around for a good portion of the drink. I was surprised to see how dark and think looking this beer was, even when raised to light i couldn't see through it at all.  S: Roasted scents galore! the scent of roasted chocolate was a perfect indicator of what was to be enjoyed. A friend across the table told me i smelled like roasted chocolate!  T: Somehow tasted even better than it smelled. A very impressive taste of chocolate, roasted oats and barley the just the right amount of bitterness. The great taste keeps you enjoying every sip of this stout.  M: The only let down of the beer was that it wasn't as thick as i prefer, but that's just me, I'm sure many would find its thickness appropriate though. A smooth beer that allows for casual drinking.  D: A great stout that I look forward to buying again. I would have no problem having a couple of these tasty treats. This is my favorite Rogue beer to date, however I'm yet to try the Shakespeare Stout which i hear is just as impressive.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Jmoore50,4.52,"Why wait? Have a Rogue Chocolate Stout. Melts in your mouth, not in your hands. Well, I will try to keep the use of the word chocolate below one hundred for this review.  The bottle is a standard bomber that can be picked up anywhere in your local liquor store.  The pour for this drink was really good and dark, not as thick as I had wanted it to be though. It came out smooth and the head that developed was thick. Three fingers thick, which is good. Why is it good? Because with that much carbonation, the smell lets loose.  The smell is strong. So strong that one could smell this from about three feet away. The chocolate aroma makes me salivate right away, thinking about sweetness.  The first sip was very pleasing to the nose and mouth. The head retention of this beer is amazing. I poured it to three fingers and it stayed consistently at a finger. The taste is really sweet, and I will even say light. I lean more towards the imperial stouts, but this one as a dessert beer is really good. I feel like they could of pushed more alcohol into it and it would increase the taste. Either way, incredibly delightful.  When drinking this beer I felt like I needed more. I personally have a sweet tooth and this beer satisfied my craving for sweets, but made me wanting more. I do feel like if I drank too many of these beers I would have a stomachache, the same one you would have with too much candy. Either way I am going to buy more of these when I can and I will enjoy every single one. Good Brew!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Not very complex, very creamy and chocolatey. Some sweet, dark, and bitter scents rise from the glass. Slight caramels and even slighter coffee.  Not as creamy as led to believe, but all the chocolates are there: milk, dark, bitter. Some coffee on the tale matched with bitter chocolate and to a decent dryness. Not much complexity, but exactly what the name leads to believe, chocolate. A little thinner then I was hoping for.

The nose is primarily chocolate with some light hints of malt.  The taste was a nice blend of chocolate and oats, as well as a lingering coffee taste. There is a nominal bitterness that complements the dominating chocolate flavor as the beer warms up.  The mouthfeel was quite good also, although given the strength flavors, it seems like it could have had a heavier body. The carbonation was reasonably good.  The overall drinkability is quite good also. I think it could have been a little better if it had been just a bit fuller in the body and flavor, but overall a great beer and I'm glad I've got more of it on supply.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The head lingered for most of the glass Left a lot of lacing.  Smell: Milk chocolate, with just hints of chocolate malt in the background to remind me that I am drinking a beer.  Taste: The bitterness of chocolate malt and coffee hits the tongue first, and as that fades, a smooth chocolate flavor lingers comes to the forefront. The chocolate lingers in the aftertaste for a long, long time. As the beer warms, the bitterness mellows, and the chocolate flavor dominates. There is a hop flavor evident that is almost swallowed up by the chocolate malt. There is a slight bitter aftertaste along with the chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy. Exactly what I would have expected for a chocolate beer. Could have used a little more carbonation, but that's nitpicking.  Drinkability: Too sweet and thick to have more than one, but I will definitely buy this again. It is one of, if not the, best chocolate beers I've had.

Good creamy lacing and chunks on the cap.  S: The nose was a deep textured roasted malt, citrus hops and liquer bittersweet chocolate. The nose is deceptive of the power that lurks within this monster.  T: Your pallet meets the smoothes delivery of roasted malts and typical west cop Cascade hops. But this is slicker than snot a kids upper lip to be as raw as possigle. Your tounge is treated to explosions of flavor of chocolate and the smoothest creamest texture I can think of.  M: Quick thick as a milkshake in some senses, but not viscous and the carbonation is might strong throughout.  D: This is by far the best chocolate stout I have ever had.

Impressively, I get milk chocolate, dark chocolate and cocoa powder out of here. Maybe a smattering of dark fruit and hops, but not much.  Hops are much more discernable in the taste, definitely west coasty. Chocolate takes on more dark unsweetened and cocoa characteristics and the dark fruits come out to play a bit more on the palate. Much more complex than I remember this one tasting, or even smelling for that matter. Just enough variety to keep it interesting all the way through a bomber and not too full or over the top to make it tough sledding.

I was less than satisfied with Young's Double Chocolate Stout(too bitter, not enough chocolate) and I wanted a chocolate beer that would redeem this chocolate goodness quality I want in a beer.  It was damn good and well worth seeking out. Perfect amount of chocolate, slight roasty bitterness, but more than acceptable. Very nice chocolate smell and flavor. Surprisingly easy to drink, just a very nice experience overall. Rogue might be a little more expensive as bombers go, but this one is definitely worth a shot if you want your beer a little sweeter on a cold night.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,yelterdow,4.84,"Cellared for the better part of three years, I will serve this in an Imperial pint glass at just over fridge temperature. 22oz. bomber, no freshness date.  Apperance- Deep chocolate brown, almost black color. The foamy head rises almost four fingers tall, medium tan with plenty of substance. The bubbles pop and fade away slowly, leaving craters that eventually fill in. No lacing, which surprises me.  Smell- Sweet decadence... the aroma is of the highest quality imported chocolate, so rich and massive. Creamy enough of a nose to smell like a good milkshake.  Taste- Absolutely stunning presentation on the palate... there is nothing that could possibly be improved here. The entry is dry and rich, sweet yet bitter. It is so mouth-filling in its character, the entire tongue is captivated by nuances of sweet, gourmet chocolatey goodness and bitter, dark notes that dry the mouth in anticipation of the next sip. The most rewarding and impressive phase for me is the swallow, which allows all ingredients to open up completely and showcase their perfect balance, and complex flavors. Never in a million years could I have been prepared for such an incredibly satisfying beer.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- I love the subtle coarseness of the mouthfeel, as it provokes the sweet and bitter attributes to work with each other while adding texture. The most phenomenally delectable stout I can recall in ages... this is a true masterpiece, and should not be overlooked for the sheer reason of broad availability, as sometimes happens.

S - Bitter coffee notes, slight piney hops, thick milk chocolate, roasted notes. No wonder it tops the list of BA's Stouts.  T - Cocoa bitterness, slight hops, some medium roast coffee and somewhat of an oat or grain. I think the hoppy bitterness is the only thing that detracts from the stout qualities.  M - Not near as thick as other full flavored stouts, a wonderful quality in a full flavored beer. Coats the tongue and leaves the cocoa and that hoppy taste behind.  D - I'd do it over again.. for free. Hell, I'd even pay money to do it over again. Wonderful brew, absolute favorite as of yet.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,SurlyDuff,4.17,"A tasty beer with a wierd Martha Stewart looking lady on the label in classic Rogue posture.  Near black with a dark tan head.  Aroma, to no surprise, is dark chocolate and some roasty nut and malt and some sugary molassas or brown sugar.  Taste lives up to the aroma, dead on. Bit of fruitiness and alchol esters, but mild. I'm not sure if it exists, but an imperial (higher abv) version of this should be made. Some espresso flavors in there too.  Gotta be in the right mood/mindset/weather for a chocolate stout, but when the mood hits, it will satisfy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mugglesandhops,4.28,"Been drinking this for a while, it was one of my first Rogues, but this is the first time I have had it on tap and fitting enough it was at the Rogue brewery in Newport.  A- Very dark brown closer to black than brown, 1 1/2 finger thick creamy brown head, lacing all the way down the glass showing every drink I took  S- Huge chocolate smell, a roasted coffee bean aroma this beer smells delicious.  T- Pretty much taste like it smells but 10 fold. Huge chocolate taste up from with a little roasted coffee bitterness in the end.  M- Thick and creamy, heavy bodied for sure  D- A little thick for something like a session beer but I could definitely have more than 1 in a sitting.  I drank around 40 different beers while I was in Portland and Newport and after The Abyss on tap this was my second favorite beer I drank.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,StJamesGate,3.93,"Pours oxblood when held to light. Rock solid head with mad rentention. Cocoa and malt on the nose. Flavor notes of sasparilla and bittersweet chocolate truffle, along with blueberry - actually, once I thought ""blueberry"" I almost couldn't taste anything else. Not as heavy in the mouth as you might expect. Cascade piney-ness cuts through at the end and lingers.  I'm not as crazy on this beer as a lot of other people, but it is a structured and very drinkable stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Adamthome1,4.52,"The aroma from my snifter hit hard and complex character of a flower and chocolate bouquet.  The taste was even more complex feeling rich and heavy on the palate enticing expected taste from the aroma.  The beer gets better as it warms, but not too warm, the taste becomes flat, if you like your dark beers extremely warm I'd recommend the Rogue Shakespeare Stout which does not have the flat chocolate flavor as it warms.  Great beer!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,hoppheadIPA,4.7,"WOW, where do I start. My favorite stout on the planet right now. Out of a 22oz bomber is a creamy blackness producing a nice creamy brown head. Smells like chocolate to me, lol. Not the cheap stuff either. I was surprised when I tasted it. The chocolate flavor is definatly overpowering like most stouts with chocolate. It's very well balanced. Mouthfeel is that of the shakespeare stout. Very creamy. #1 in my fridge, even though you can only have 1 or 2 at a time.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,jbsmth,4,"At first taste, I loved this beer. Subsequent tastings, however, made me realize that although it delivers on the promise of chocolate flavors, that's not necessarily what I'm looking for in a beer.  For me, hops, malt, and yeast make up the heart of the flavor of beer. These three things should be balanced for the beer to taste really good. There are other things which can be added to beers to enhance the flavor, but I feel if an enhancement eclipses either the hops, the malt, or the yeast, it's been overdone.  That's the best way I can describe Rogue Chocolate Stout, a good beer with added flavor that's been overdone. I'll stick with Young's Double Chocolate Stout, which tastes like beer, but reminds me of chocolate, not the other way around.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A little hint of coffee as well.  T - Excellent, a really robust dark chocolate flavor.  M - Really smooth, light carbonation. 6% ABV doesn't hurt  D - A little heavy for a session beer, but this was a very drinkable stout. I really enjoyed this one and plan on hunting down some more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,cvfish,4.35,"A - This beer poured a solid black color that produced a nice fluffy, moderately sized dark brown head which had great retention and laced the side of the glass very nicely  S - The aromas of this beer were dominated by the chocolate, but some coffee and dark fruits did sneak in  T - The taste of this beer was exactly in line with the nose and the title of this beer, instead of a bitter chocolate flavor it is a sweet, milk chocolate espresso experience, with a little bit a dark fruits in the background to break the richness if the chocolate  M - The mouthfeel of this beer is the only thing I take a slight issue with, only a medium body, still creamy, and slight amount of carbonation  D - This is another solid beer by Rogue, the only reason they don't get less than a 4 in this catagory is because this beer is so damn good",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,pseudo,4.25,"Poured into a pint glass  Wow what a great lookin beer, black as the night with a chocolate colored head. Lots of lacing and the head stays for a while (shared with my friend, his pour's head was a lot less though and left quicker)  smells like a dark chocolate and hops. Very sweet and appealing. It taste's amazing. Very balanced with mostly dark chocolate and coffee notes. There's also a slight bitterness and alcohol in the finish (but it compliments it very well).  mouthfeel is nice but not as thick as I thought it might be considering it's a very dark stout. I couldn't drink too much of this mostly considering the price. However, if it was free i'd drink it all day long.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,corby112,4.25,Pours a cocoa colored brown with thin white head. Aroma dominated by chcolate malts roasted coffee and tostie rolls. Flavor once again dominated by chocolate and chocolate malts. Nice roasted character and hops provide a tasty bitter dry finish. Very Good!,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Monkeyknife,3.95,"Poured from the bottle a solid dark brown/black with a healthy three fingers of mocha-colored head.  Aroma of chocolate milk and toasted malts.  The taste is thinner and has a bitterness I didn't expect. More like a dark unsweetened type of chocolate along with coffee and toasted malts. The bitterness lingers through the finish.  Thin, wet mouthfeel with light carbonation.  Thinner and less chocolate than expected. Not that it's a bad thing. I still enjoyed it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,hwwty4,3.91,"Thanks to Julian for this one. I've almost bought this beer about a dozen times. Thanks for helping my indecision.  Poured a bomber into my Tripel Karmeliet glass. Wow, this is a like the Mona Lisa poured into a tulip. Just beautiful. This beer pours a nice dark brown with a huge 3 finer beige head that looks like it has the consistency of amaretto soaked ladyfingers. As the head melts into a nice thin layer, it leaves really nice lacing. The lacing actually reminds me more of what a resiny DIPA leaves behind on the glass, then an American stout should. The aroma is of Hershey's Milk Chocolate Syrup, cream, and just a slight hop bitterness at the end of the nose. The taste is a bit disappointing to me. Its very one dimensional. Baker's chocolate and sweet cream, that's about all. The mouthfeel is full and cream but surprisingly doesn't linger all that much. This is a good beer but the flavor profile seems to be lacking just a little for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,lhaqq,4.02,"A: Creamy, thick, dark tan head with a near-black body. S: Candy-store sugary--a sweetness kind of like being in a chocolatier. T: Sweet, dark chocolate and caramel.

132,1118,MeanGene,4.37,"An extremely good chocolate stout.  Lucky enough to find it on Nitro-tap at Elmer Sudd's in Wilkes-Barre, PA. I've had it out of the 22oz bottle as well. Pours midnight black with a good-sized tannish head. Smells like pure milk chocolate...unreal! Mouthfeel and taste are exactly how the good Lord envisioned...very noticeable coffee and milk chocolate overtones.  I am a big fan of Rogue and this is unquestionably one of their best offerings...Definitely worth a try!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,williamherbert,4.17,"Deep dark chocolate brown. Dark tan head. Brown spiderweb of lace. Head sticks around for a few minutes. Quite good.  A very chocolatey sweetness in the nose, balanced by a lightly toasted malt. Almost like chocolate milk with a heavy malted base. Very sweet and appealing.  Sweet malt flavors, very heavy chocolate in the malt. Roasted but not burnt or bitter. A taste more like liquid chocolate than like a stout. Warmth gives a hint of roasted bitterness.  Creamy and rich feel on the tongue. Milky, with a tiny bite at the swallow. Otherwise, as smooth as it gets. In this beer, chocolate is the name of the game. Sweet (but not saccharine) and very smooth. Quite quite good.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,spointon,4.05,"I poured this one from a 22oz brown bomber bottle into a tulip pint glass.  A= This stout poured black as pitch with zero light penetration through the glass. The head fluffed up to a towering 2.5"" of dark tan creaminess. Once it settled, the head provided a nice 1/8"" cap over the beer and trailed rings of sticky lace all the way down.  S= Aromas of sweet chocolate, dark grains, very faint coffee grounds, cocoa crispies, and an earthiness that is hard to describe.  T= Taste was not half as sweet as the smell. Starts off with strong flavors of bittersweet dark chocolate, carob, and a weak coffee bitterness. Roasted malts and earthy hops kicked in midway leading into an astringent, puckering, dry finish.  MF= Heavy body with a chewy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. The carbonation combined with the bitter finish made this one feel fairly crisp.  D= One of the better beers I have had from Rogue and certainly one of the best chocolate stouts out there. I wish the flavor matched the sweetness of the aroma more, but still a very drinkable beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Yesac,4.01,"A - Solid brown/black in color. Sloppy/foamy light brown head.  S - Extremely rich chocolate complex aromas. Dark chocolates, cocoa. Couldn't smell any better.  T - Musty, dry chocolate taste similar to powdered chocolate, disappointing after such a great smell. Java/malt finish.  M - Very smooth, the carbonation cleans off the palate and leaves it with a smooth thin chocolate coating.  D - Smooth and easy to drink, but the taste isn't what I was expecting.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jpalarchio,4.38,"Pours a deep black with a nice caramel head. Chocolate is very evident at the nose and even more so with taste. Very smooth with a little bit of bite to it.

132,1118,BeerImmediately,4.57,"Black & tan pour with very lite lacing.  Wow, what a nose.. sweet chocolate, wrapped around salted peanuts - Liquid Baby Ruth bar.  Roasted coffee bean dryness to balance out the sweet cocoa - just the right combo.  Creamy mouthfeel, with just enough bitter bite to leave you wanting more. And more.  Very drinkable - low alcohol, and not a harsh tone to be found. Bravo!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,nighthawk,4.28,"Bomber poured into my trusty mug.  Pours black, opaque, with hints of brown at the edges. Large, tightly bubbled light tan head dissipates into a rocky, sticky foam, leaving plenty of lacing and chunks on the glass. Retention is ridiculous, it just won't go away.  Roasted grains (oats, maybe a little wheat) and chocolate nose, very light caramel and floral aromas in the background.  Brief charred grains flavour is followed quickly by dark chocolate. Smooth milk and caramel sweetness is a nice interlude before very well-roasted grains make another appearance. Rich and silky chocolate on the finish, with a touch of bitterness.  Mouthfeel is nice and silky, smooth, lightly creamy without ever feeling heavy. Not what I'd describe as ""light"" though. Definite presence in the mouth, with just enough carbonation.  A good solid stout, with chocolate adding a nice creamy sweet touch. This one delivers what it promises. I only wish it were available cheaper here.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kinger,3.69,"Rich floral aroma with a dark bitter chocolate scent. Black pour with a 3/4"" head that settles down to a solid 1/4"", but no lacing ouch. Mouthfeel is much thinner than anticipated, finish is primarily bitter. Flavor is decent, the chocolate doesn't come through as much as in the aroma and the bittering hops seem to have a tight grasp on the taste. Overall this is not one of my top picks, kind of bummed out. The regular Shakespeare is much better. I'll be using what's left in the bomber to make a black and tan, Cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DoctorDog,2.86,"Presentation: 650ml bottle into a large mug.  A- Deep brown/black, completely opaque in appearance. Pours with massive brown/tan head, which fades slowly to but a thin coating, leaving heavy lacing.  S- Chocolate syrup odor wafts up, and grassy hoppiness there if I bury my nose deep.  T- Starts off bland with a burnt coffee finish. I was too impatient, perhaps, and needed to let it warm. As it warms, vague hints of chocolate appear (still less prominent than expected), and the coffee finish mellows substantially. Still disappointed.  M- Medium/light....thinner than I had hoped.  D- Eh....ok. Not too heavy, but I can't imagine even a fan wanting more than this bomber worth.  Future outlook: Disappointed in this one. Doubtful that I will revisit it anytime soon.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,josiahschlender,4.49,"A gentle pour almost overflows my glass with a large, nestle quik colored head. Very dark brown in color, but not quite black. The head lasts pretty long, but leaves no lacing.  Wow, the smell is so chocolatey. One of the most striking aromas of any beer I've tried. Maybe a bit of lactose sweetness, with bittersweet roastiness and just a bit of earthy hops. It smells more like chocolate than chocolate does. I don't know how they did that... definitely increased with some warmth, too.  Flavors are not so one-dimensional, but they are excellent. Dark chocolate (the 70% cocoa kind) is balanced by roasted grains and a surprising amount of earthy, bittering hops. Well, it's a Rouge, I shouldn't be surprised by the hops.  Great mouthfeel, matches the flavors perfectly and keeps the complex flavors milling around for a good while.  If it weren't for the high price point of the beer, I'd probably give this a higher drinkability score. Phenomenally good for a ""sweet stout,"" which is one of the few beer styles I have a hard time enjoying.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,johnd513,3.9,"This beer pours a dark brown that is almost black with a nice frothy off white head that sticks around for a while and leaves nice lacing on the glass.

M: Smooth, light, and lingers in your mouth, making it great 22oz. to sit down and enjoy all byu yourself. Got better the more it warmed up too!  D: loved this beer, I'd buy it again for sure. With only a 6% ABV you could easily have two of these!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,CHSLBrew,4.05,"Poured into and enjoyed from a pint glass.  A-Poured with an attractive mid-brown head. Strong retention throughout the drink, likely due in part to pouring into the glass a couple times. Deep black color with almost no light penetrating.  S-A strong aroma of rich chocolate right off the get go. Also, bits of chocolaty and coffee malts.  T-On the first instant of the first sip, this beer kicked me in the face with chocolate flavors. As I would learn, this chocolate taste oversees the entirety of the taste. After the initial flood of chocolate, a sweet maltiness surfaces, with strong overtones of roasted and coffee malts. A present bitterness nicely balances this beer, keeping the sweet and chocolate in check.  M-Very smooth on the palate, with a medium feel. Not overly carbonated (goodd!).  D-This beer was enjoyable throughout the whole bottle. However, drinkability is moderate, as the chocolatiness could prove to be too assertive in the long run. But for one sitting, this beer is a treat.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S - It smells like a tootsie roll followed by a small amount of roastiness and a bit of alcohol. My favorite part of the beer!!  T - Some coffee bitterness right at the beginning followed by a smooth creamy milk chocolately taste that lingers with a small amount of alcohol hint in the end.  M - Great stuff - smooth drinking, medium bodied close to thick. A small stingy sensation left in the mouth after swallow.  D - Too sweet to drink more that one in an evening, but something that would be good to have on hand when you need a chocolate fix. Good stuff!!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smelled of very sweet malts. This stout had a lot more flavor than some of the others I've and much for chocolate/ cocoa flavor. It just didn't come 100% together for me. There was a lot of bitterness going on. Mouth feel was good and it was very drinkable.  I would go with the ommegang chocolate or brooklyn.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smell- Roasted cocoa malt and a touch of coffee.  Taste- First struck by a taste of tasty hops that quickly subsides to a delicious chocolate milkshake. I am not kidding, this tastes remarkably choclatey and is delicious, slightly bitter on the aftertaste but very much a chocolate lovers delight.  Mouthfeel- No what I would expect for a stout, surprisingly thin. A thicker brew here would go better with the heavier flavors.  Drinkability- On the flip side of a light stout it is more drinkable, one of the few stouts I could have more than one of.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Aroma - Strong roasted dark chocolate malts mixed with a good dose of freshly ground coffee beans, burnt butter, cola traces, freah vanilla pods, some piney / grassy hops, toasted (charred ?) malt loaf, chocolate cookies (some dough), slight smokiness, cocoa powder...  Taste - Strong charred / sooty notes, bitter black coffee mixed with sweetish milk chocolate and also some dark bitter chocolate (although it's not quite as chocolatey as i was expecting)... lots of pepperiness, light pine, some powdered chocolate, light treacle, grassy and earthy traces, some tobacco smokiness, faint roasted nuttiness...  Feel - Quite sharp and dry - not as smooth as i was expecting... medium / full bodied.. a very quaffable brew even at 6% - no real trace of the alcohol..

This one is the epitome of choc stouts. Dark...basically totally opaque. Sweet chocolaty goodness whafting during pour and drinking. Taste..sweeet and smooth. Minor in thickness-lacking but thicker than 75% of others in the stout category. Almost too drinkable...and at the price, I had to cut myself off. Great beer!...GO GET ONE.

Earthy hops and malt initially hit the palate, but then give way to a chocolate delight.  M- A little too watered down for me. I was hoping it would be a little more viscous in texture, but I can't complain...it tasted great.  D- At 6% abv and low viscosity, combined with chocolate goodness, I could drink this beer all night.  Overall, very impressed as to how rich the chocolate taste in this beer.

Tastes like the aroma, mainly straightforward rich dark chocolate, with toast, and a bit of orange with its peel. Barely perceptibly sweet. Well balanced. Chocolate toast lingers, with some medium bitterness. Very tasty.  Smooth rich texture. Refreshing, quite drinkable.

M-- perfect medium body...goes down very smooth and easy...again the hops help to clean the sweetness away getting ready for the next sip but their taste is not present unless you are searching hard..

T: Chewy chocolate with the volume of sweetness a little high for my taste and didnt have any bitter to challenge it. The vanilla and nougat offered something more to the character but nothing mind blowing. Lots of flavor in here though. I do enjoy the roasted malts.  M: Chunky filling mouthfeel.

Too much of a good thing when they package this stuff in 22 oz's.  An after dinner beer for sure. Pours a pure black with some lacing. This beer is meant to stick to the ribs. It should be a food category all by itself. If you are watching your carb count, this is not the beer for you. The amount of calories I consumed in just one bottle would make a Big Mac cry. Oh well....the love of beer I guess.  Thanks Rogue for a great, very filling beer. And now onto the Big Mac. Good thing I work out daily.

Just the right amount of carbonation and a nice dry finish..  d- I've only eve bought this by the 1pint 6 0z. bottle so I couldnt say other wise, but I cant definatly drink that bottle in one sitting and im feeling great afterwards. Probably wouldnt want mch more at once though  yes yes yes.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Voonder,3.94,"Beautiful beer! Pours black in colour with huge, I mean HUGE caramel brown head with lots of lace. Smell - dark chocolate, coffee, malts. Taste is the same, less chocolate that I would expect, but still really deep taste. Mouthfeel - silky, with medium carbonation. Drinkability - yes, it's drinkable, but honestly, based on reviews I expected a bit more from this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Jayli,4.48,"This beer pours a wonderful black - no light passes through. A foamy 1 1/2 finger head that dissipates leaving a lingering head. Great lacing throughout. There is a rich chocolate scent with hints of caramel, and potentially a bit of coffee. The taste picks up where the scent ends - rich chocolate flavoring...but more of a darker chocolate flavoring. There is a slight bitter aftertaste - but the beer itself is so good, that the aftertaste can be overlooked. The beer is more carbonated than I would have anticipated. However, unlike other beers that I have had with this much carbonation it's not overpowering and doesn't detract from the beer. This is a fantastic chocolate stout - I hope to find it again soon!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,julian,4.41,"A: jet black, with a thick pillowy brown head from an deep pour. Almost solid foam lacing on the opposite side of the glass I've been drinking from and dotted lacing on the side I have been drinking from.  S: Mildly roasted, dark chocolate aroma, slightly bitter, yet sweet at the same time. notes of caramel, and toffee and maybe even some coffee beans in there too.  T: Taste is rich with chocolate. Tastes like dark baker's chocolate, in that it's slightly dry and bitter. It also has a mild roasted feel about it which was prevalent in the aroma too. Taste sweetens later on bringing out the flavor of mild caramel or toffee. Finishes off smooth. No lingering bitterness.  M: Great feel all around. Medium carbonation, smooth & easy drinking.  D: This is a super easy drinking beer. No sipping necessary, you can take a mouthful and down it with ease.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,PatronWizard,4.2,"Bomber to glass...  Black fluid with thick cream tan head. Love the creamy heads. Great looking beer.  Smell reminds me of Easter. Rich milk chocolate. Can almost smell the creaminess. Can also smell some dark chocolate. Maybe some coffee.  Taste of bitter and burnt chocolate. Good, but the nose is better in this case. Coffee flavor is present. As are a trace of hops way late in the game.  Thick for sure but not as creamy on the tongue as I expected (or hoped). Seems to have a teeny tiny bit more carbonation than is called for.  Far, far too easy to drink. I find myself taking gulps instead of sips. Good thing? Bad thing? I've had some stouts I wouldn't dare gulp.  As I was trying to figure out why it's so easy to drink, the wife tells me ""it's the alcohol."" So I checks it out and sure enough, 6% ABV, which is incredibly light for me. No big deal, just means I can drink a few!  As it turns out, this is a very tasty, very easy to drink beer. In my pathetic opinion, all craft beer drinkers should keep one of these in their collection for the buddy who stops by. Tremendous potential as a gateway beer.  Overall: great beer",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The first sip leads to a cascade of great stout flavors chocolate coffee and roasted malts abound . By far one of the best stouts I have had for a while . The body is on point for the style .

132,1118,SimplySinister,4.5,"A - Good head, moderate carbonation, and terrific lacing. This is a pretty stout.  S - Chocolate and malt.  T - This beer is aptly named ""chocolate stout"" for its intense chocolate flavor. The chocolate quite obviously contains a high percentage of pure cacao (bakers chocolate) giving the beer a bitter taste. In some ways, this stout is reminiscent of a more bitter Young's Double Chocolate Stout and a much less sweet version of Mackeson Triple XXX Stout. All in all, it is rather one-dimensional, but it is all it claims to be; which earns extra points in my book.  M - Dry, clean, and light.  D - This stout would definitely take serious points here if and only if Rouge came down on the price quite a bit. This beer is just *way* too expensive at $6 per pint.  I may complain about the price, but this beer is world class.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,GilGarp,4.4,"It pours from a 22oz. painted brown bomber into the Sam Adams glass. It has a nearly black color with just a hint of dark brown around the edges. Lots of rocky head top the beer and it sticks around quite a while. The lacing is pretty good too.  Aroma is good, sweet and chocolatey with just a bit of roasted coffee.  Flavor is excellent - it's chocolate for sure but also a bit of espresso, both sweet and bitter, some earthy grassy notes, and hops. Chocolate is definately the theme and it comes shining through without being overpowered.  Mouthfeel is smooth and balanced, just enough carbonation, and it's good that it's not too much because a stout like this is best when the brewer goes easy on the bubbles.  Drinkability is good but really couldn't be any higher considering the sweet dessert-like nature of the beer.  Overall a great example of a chocolate stout - the best I've had.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jf2,4.27,"Presentation: Standard 1p 6 fl oz bottle, poured into glass slightly shorter and wider than a pint glass.  Appearance: Poured a heavy dark brown. A surprising amount of carbonation without truly forming a head. Very little lace at first, and once head settled, there was none.  Nose: Toasty, with notes of coffee and, yes, chocolate.  Taste: Rich malt, with toasted flavors, both chocolate and coffee. A very slightly sweet finish is followed by a slightly bitter after taste, but in a positive way, which reminds me that I am drinking a toasty stout.  Mouth Feel: Surprisingly carbonated and light, compared to other stouts (in my opinion). Early in the bottle the carbonation was cloying, but dissipated later in the bottle, possible as the beer warmed.  Drinkablilty: Quite delicious. I liked it more and more as I finished the bottle.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,EnojysAnyBeer,4.88,"What a truly exceptional stout. My 1st chocolate-infused beer and I am blown away  A- Poured vigorously for an amazing 4-finger frothy, cascading, latte-colored head that leaves lacing all over the glass. Deep opaque black.  S- Smells like chocolate liquor mixed with the traditional malted barley and hops of a beer.  T- Taste is unbelievably chocolate. The sugary taste of the chocolate greatly compliments the sweet malts and the bitter taste compliments the spicy hops  M- Feels like a watery hot-chocolate mix. Medium-heavy body and silky carbonation  D- I could drink this for as long as my sweet tooth is awake and then some just for kicks. The bittersweet aftertaste makes you want more after every sip.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Thunderball,3.67,"Poured midnight black into a mug. The smell was of chocolate milk, and coffee. Taste was chocolate up front with a campfire type coffee with chicory. A smokey, bitter finish. No one could say that this is not a well crafted brew, its just not my bag. Too much of a good thing that my palate grew tired of quite quickly. I will probably not be revisiting this offering again anytime in the future.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ckaufman,4.35,"Had this beer on cask at Fathead's on Pittsburgh's south side.  Pumped into a massive dimpled mug, this beer was black as the night with little to no head whatsoever. Massive smell of malted barley, chocolate, and a pinch of wood. Tasted like someone melted a chocolate bar into my beer. Strong malt backbone prevails here. There was minimal carbonation and this beer went down silky smooth. Excellent in the cask... recomend you track this brew down in the cask if you like it from the bottle.  Cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,timmah427,4.13,"Pours dark black with a brownish, creamy head that soon sinks down. Aroma is dark chocolate and roasted malts. Taste is at first dominated by roasted malt flavors, but gives way to milk chocolate flavors. An overall delicious, perfectly balanced chocolate stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,daythree16,4.53,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass. Pours jet black with a really nice three finger head that looks like cappuccino foam. Each sip adds another layer of lace to the spiderweb-like strands that coat the entire glass.  The aroma that stands out the most is milk chocolate. Very sweet and inviting. In fact, it smells like a bowl of Cocoa Puffs. Taste is sweet up front with some chocolate and dark roasted malts. Dark chocolate finish with just a touch of hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Medium-bodied. Drinkability is awesome. This is one smooth and delicious stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,tedsox31,4.29,"Appearance: Pours pure black into a 12 oz. pint glass. There is about a finger of head and it leaves a trail of lace down the side of the glass.  Smell: Very, very full of chocolate. It is mostly what I can smell. There may be some malts that I detect, but it definitely is huge on chocolate.  Taste: The taste reminds me of the kind of semi-sweet or dark chocolate that I use when I'm making fudge. It is pleasantly sweet but also with a nice bitterness that balances the sweetness of the chocolate malts. I do not taste much else other than that.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, with a pleasant bite of carbonation. This is not a too-heavy stout, but it still is heavy enough that you would call it a stout.  Drinkability: Definitely one of the finer stouts that I have enjoyed. No more than one for me in a sitting, but a beer that I would like to drink again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,AWolfAtTheDoor,4.5,"Pours liquid midnight into my Green Flash pint glass. Tall mocha color head that recedes quickly enough. Reasonable lacing throughout the session.  BAM chocolate on the nose. Maybe some roasted malts trying to emerge, but the nose is ALL about choloate.  Nice balance of roasted malts and choloate on the mouth. Smooth and sexy. Goes down quicker than a Bangkok prostitute (from what I've heard...)  Surprisingly light mouth feel. Would have expected a little more from such a choco tastic beer, but then again it's only 6%.  Super drinkable. I put away the entire bomber myself. Killer beer. One of my favorite offerings from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,itcomesnpints,4.7,"An expansive gloomy head with great retention over an ebony vacuum. The scent is of tantalizing Dutch dark chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is absolutely unbelievable. Rich chocolate cake with a warm swirl of alcohol, topped with a taste of cascade hops to add to the bittersweet cocoa finish. Medium to heavy, very balanced mouthfeel. One bomber was not enough to satisfy. Need more. Many more. The bar has been raised. Hats way off to this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Goliath,4.23,"Pours black and completely opaque. A large inch and a half mocha colored head forms and lingers with excellent retention leaving some lacing down the sides of the glass.  The aroma is nice, but more subtle than I would have assumed. Dark chocolate is definitely a dominant aroma, in addition to a touch of hops.  Taste is great. A really big burst of bitter dark chocolate dominates. A touch of that hop bitterness. Just a great beer.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick, and creamy. This one has a nice carbonation tingle as well.  Drinkability is fairly high. Just great big bold flavor, and low alcohol makes this one easy to consume and enjoy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,changeup45,3.47,"Bomber. Pours a very black color, moderate tan head that doesn't last long. Chocolate, malty aroma, although not all that strong. The flavor is pretty nice with dark chocolate right away with subtle malts and bitter hop notes following. This seems more like a dessert. Hell, maybe it can be. I can't drink too many of these chocolate beers though. A simple 12 ounce would have been fine.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,WillClark,4.47,"Poured out of a 22oz bottle into an imperial pint glass a thick, dirty brown with a stern mocha head that settled in like a champ. All I can think of is chocolate malted shakes from the aromas released from this manly head, which maintained its frothiness and left a nice amount of sweet lacing on the side of the glass. The taste is superb- not overly roasted, bitter notes, but a brilliant cocoa sweetness and a crisp finish that makes me want more....and more. Highly drinkable- one of the few stouts I could use as a session but with most likely debaucherous results.  The first time I had this was on cask at the Rogue Ale House in North Beach and I enjoyed it, but something about the effervescence of the bottled version increases my enjoyment. Definitely up there with Young's Double Chocolate. Maybe even a trump of it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,katan,3.93,"22 oz bomber, undated  A - Pours dark as night in color - light color bleed through on the edges. carbonation is present heavily through the strong head, which dissipates into a light film.  S - chocolate all the way. What did I expect? Perhaps some roasted off notes are hiding behind there - very subtle.  T - Starts off with a strong dark chocolate flavor - very robust. Goes to a bittering mid-taste that complements the first hit nicely. Finishes with what I would say is more of a dark cocoa flavor that seems very unsweetened. After a few more drinks, I find that the ""chocolate bomb"" has mellowed in my mind to a much more even kiel balance.  M - Thick and creamy - certainly solid in body. Not a bit of carbonation bite that I would associate with the appearance.  D - Sitting heavy on my stomach, which would indicate the strong body is filling me up. Nonetheless, I find it easy to drink. The lower ABV by style also is a bonus here.  Glad I finally tried this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Proteus93,4.22,"A: Jet black and viscuous... a creamy, and slightly foamy head - light golden brown.  S: A rich cocolate aroma, over a roasted malt scent. Some soft coffee aromas subtly mixed into things. Very nice.  T: Closer to baker's chocolate, with unsweetened notes of bitterness. Maltiness and a hint of hoppiness for balance.  M: Quite a sharp and assertive carbonation into a slightly thinner mouthfeel. More creaminess would be great, and it could be excellent on cask.  D: Not cloying, which is a big plus for a beer with such added flavours - at least in this style. With some more body, it would be an even better evening sipper.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Tons of chocolate malt and Hershey syrup.  T: Taste is so chocolaty and sweet! Also a tad bitterness from black malt that goes so well with the chocolate sweetness! A mild hop finish, but nothing exceptional  Overall, a great dessert beer that is worth drinking!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,HoppyMcStout,4.24,"This beer pours a very rich black. The scent is undoubtedly of chocolate and chocolate malt. For some reason, this time around the beer tasted a little harsher than I recall. This might be due to the fact that I was previously drinking hazelnut brown which is so very smooth itself. At the very least, it has solid stout flavor, and also has the benefit of being another one of those few beers with chocolate that actually tastes like chocolate, but without tasting artificial or detracting from the actual beer flavor.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ljbrisson,4.38,"Presentation: 22 oz. bottle with a retro graphic. I didn't prefer the dark red and beige color scheme, but after tasting the beer the bottle seemed to fit the taste. The bottlecap was pragmatic, although one of the nicer I have seen and definitely better than Flying Fish's white-on-red flying fish logo.  Appearance: Hard pour into a pint glass, this beer had a 1.5 inch think tan-colored head and I still had beer left to pour! It was as black as I have ever seen a beer; I actually held it up to a light and it still was black. Looked like a delicious glass of spent motor oil.  Aroma: Smelled mostly of chocolate, but I could detect some roasted coffee and even a little bit of hops and a lot of sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Thick, warm, slick, velvety. This is a heavy, heavy beer and I loved it. There is a perfect amount of carbonation to slice through the heavy feel and break it up a little bit.  Taste: Chocolate, mocha, a little sweet caramel, and finishes with bitter dark chocolate taste and a tinge of hops. For the beginning, I felt like I was drinking chocolate pudding; the end brought me back to reality as I tasted the more bitter finish. The hops definitely keep the chocolate taste from being overwhelming.  This is the best beer I have had in quite a while. I highly recommend it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,glid02,4.67,"Got this on tap at Stout's Irish Pub in Atlanta.  The glass was opaque black with a light brown head. It looks delicious. Lacing sticks around but isn't that sticky.  The smell is great - smells like someone just opened a dark chocolate bar. There's also the slightest amount of coffee.  The taste is also very good. It's mostly chocolate, with a bit of coffee taste that diminishes as the beer warms. There's some hop bitterness near the end which I also like.  The mouthfeel is absurdly smooth and creamy. The carbonation is just enough to release the flavors. Really great.  This beer is very drinkable. Everything about the beer is awesome, I docked half a point just because the chocolate taste could be overpowering after a while.  Definitely recommend this beer. Nothing else I can really say.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ryrust5301,4.44,"Appearance - What a marvelous looking beer in the glass! This thing just looks like a chocolate bomb! Dark black in color with a dark tan, almost brown hefty head. Layer of tan creaminess is left on top after the head vanishes.  Smell - Creamy and smooth with an overwhelming presence of chocolate. It's a bitter smelling bakers chocolate in this one if I had to guess.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Takes the smell and kicks it up a notch. Very smooth and creamy in the mouth. Meadium body but nothing too harsh. I can't get over how smooth this is. Creamy as hell with a huge bitter bakers chocolate that tko's the tastebuds. Finish is very bitter and somewhat powdery. A coffee note comes in just a bit in the aftertaste.  Drinkability - Would I have another one of these? YES, and another, and another, and another. This is one mean ass beer to throw down as a dessert itself. Pair it up with something, anything, and don't share. You'll want it all just for yourself.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,MikeWilson,4.44,"The pour produced a jet-black beer with a dense and frothy brown head. The aroma was strong and extremely complex: Dark chocolate was the most obvious, and so assertive it made my mouth water a little for want of a Hershey's bar. I also detected roasted grains and some ""earthiness"" that was in the background, perhaps some other character lent by the chocolate. Subtle hints of alcohol rounded out the aroma.  The roasted grains and chocolate flavors complement eachother perfectly. Roasted barley creeps up in the aftertaste and stays there. This beer is also rather bitter, both from the hops and the dark grains. Substantial fruitiness appears as the beer warms up. I detected a little bit of oxidation but it doesn't harm the overall impression. Just a little too carbonated for my tastes. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy. The silkiness on my tongue makes me believe this beer was brewed with oats.  Final impression: An outstanding beer! I really loved how the character changed as the beer went from fridge to near-room temperatures. I must always have a few bottles of this stuff around.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,maximum12,3.86,"Split this bomber with the wife after an unusually short debate on what of our pile of beers to drink.  Pours black & smells like a, a...Tootsie Roll. Seriously. I thought about it during the entire glass. Every time my nose went anywhere near the rim thoughts of those little black logs went dancing through my head. Not much head, but a meager swirl brings it, & the massive smell, right back to the hop.  Tastes like Tootsie Pops soaked in hops. An expected bunch of sweet cocoa up front, an unexpected hop bite in the back, & bits of burnt matter flaking along the sides.  This beer is smooth, silkly, & the cocoa comes on stronger with each sip. The alcohol warmth only becomes noticeable about halfway through the glass. Drinkability is low, this is one of those stouts that's heavy & filling.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S - Dominated by roasted malts and dark chocolate, as expected.  T - Again, dominated by roasted malts and dark chocolate. Make that LOTS of dark chocolate! A small touch of hop bitterness came through in the finish.  M - Full-bodied, thick and wet on the palate. It left a slight aftertaste of dark chocolate, which I'm definitely not complaining about!

132,1118,ibbjamin,4.35,"Paid $5.49 for a bomber from BevMo in Gilroy, CA. Poured into a pint glass with 2 pours.  Inch and a half of a dark tan head that is moderately frothy. Superb head retention. Very dark brown, nearing black. Thick dark tan lacing that lasts.  Smells very strong of roasted malts and dark chocolate. More like a sweet and tasty dessert than a beer :)  At first, it doesn't have as strong of a taste as I was expecting. Actually just a mild flavor similar to how it smells. Aftertaste of dark chocolate. After drinking more of it and letting her warm up, the deeper more robust flavors start to come out.  One of the lightest bodied and easiest drinking stouts I've had. Lightly carbonated. An almost watery drink and finish. If I had to pick something to be improved upon, it would have to be the mouthfeel; maybe a little creamier finish.  Highly recommended. Nothing too crazy going on, but they have damn near perfected your classic American Chocolate Stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

This beer is black, no transparency, no edge glow, just black.  Smell upfront is powdered cocoa, reminds me of nestle quick chocolate milk powder. There is a couple distinguishable chocolate scents in this, the real cocoa powder, and the malty chocolate grain. Very cool.. Some sweatness in the smell, a milky cream like smell too.  This is good! Big sweet chocolate upfront, then a chocolate grain bitterness, some carbonation zing on the tounge. More chocolate. At the swallow a spiced cocoa, bitter bakers chocolate, some dry bittering lingers. Thick and creamy, this beer is like a milkshake.

132,1118,cvstrickland,4.42,"22-ounce bomber poured into a snifter yields a dark chestnut body with a thick lid of fine-bubbled mocha foam that looks more like bread dough than bubbles. The creamy foam retains at a broken sheet that leaves plenty of webby lacing on the glass.  Smell is chocolatey, toasty and wonderful with a dose of fruity hops.  Taste is smoky bittersweet chocolate with blast of tangy, bitter hops and a sugary snap of unsweetened Hershey's syrup. A dry, powdery alkaline cocoa flavor is accented with notes of dark, high-cacao chocolate and a firm, charred bit of roasted barley. Oats add silkiness and an earthy, gritty, hearty heft to the drink. A winey note of French Roast coffee shines amidst the superb semi-sweetness.  Super good, smooth, and very drinkable despite the excess of chocolatey goodness.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,Reagan1984,4.15,"O.K., lets just start by getting a couple of the cliché's out of the way, since they are so appropriate. The Color is of dark chocolate, very dark brown but not quite black. A light brown sticky creamy head forms atop the beer and sticks around for a short time. Afterwards a sticky light brown ring remains around the edge of the glass. This ring contributes to some lacing as the beer is consumed.  The aroma is of cocoa powder, fresh baked brownies and roasted goodness.  The taste is wonderful and begins as unsweetened chocolate then adds a very subtle fruitiness. After this the taste begins to fade and you are left with a roasted, chocolate bitterness. I am a huge chocolate fan, so I like this. It really reminds me of unsweetened baking chocolate, which I can never resist trying when I bake. It also has the dry almost astringent finish that comes with unsweetened chocolate.  The mouth feel is actually lighter than I had expected and a bit less than I would prefer. I'd like this to feel as big as it tastes.  Drinkability is quite nice and this is one that needs to be served at cellar temperature to really be enjoyed. As I slowly enjoyed this, I really noticed more flavors popping up as the beer warmed slightly.  This is a really nice stout, but I have to admit that I prefer Young's Double Chocolate Stout which combines that great flavor with a more appropriate/creamy mouth feel.  Having said that, you should also be sure not to miss this beer.  I am becoming a big Rogue fan!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,generallee,4.68,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 22oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance: It's very dark brown, almost black in color. The body is quite opaque with a few streams of tiny bubbles that are only visible near the sides of the glass. The head is thick and pillowy with excellent retention. It has a dark tan color and it leaves behind cool tan lace that slowly slides down the sides of the glass.  Smell: The aroma has a pleasant blend of dark and milk chocolate with doughy sweetbread malt.  Taste/Mouth feel: The flavor has a wonderful balance with a mild, subtle malt base with semi sweet chocolate and some roasted flavors that turns more bitter sweet and dark chocolaty as the hops add a mild bitterness. The palate is smooth and mellow with a medium body that gets thinner and drier in the finish. Carbonation is active yet still smooth.  Notes: Over all this has an easy drinking character with nicely balanced flavors that work well and complement each other wonderfully.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Doomcifer,4.5,"Pours a pitch black brew that lets not a hint of light through. Huge, frothy, dark tan/brown head that retains with a deathgrip on the side of the pint glass. Smells of Hershey's chocolate syrup, sweet chocolate, lactose, roasty malts. Splendid. Taste is more sweet, roasty malty flavors balanced by the nice chocolate touches and a nice hop finish. Very well rounded. Mouthfeel is extremely velvety and thick, yet airy. Perfect amount of carbonation and finishes dry with help from the hops. Very drinkable, this tremendous beer is.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,pmcadamis,4.52,"I had this one at The Grape Escape in downtown Galena.  A - Obsidian black and as thick as Satan's snot. This is pure black evil in the glass.  S - Deep milk and dark chocolates, along with some really powerful hop notes. This smells like chocolate of the highest quality, not the Count Chocula artificial notes that I smell in some chocolate beers. This is like Belgian chocolate goodies.  T - Chocolate and hops marry to make a nearly flawless flavor. This is outstanding.  M - Thick and full bodied with a nice hop tightness and a slightly dry finish that clears up all of the residual sugars.  D - Excellent! This is some good stuff.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,MrHurmateeowish,4.6,"22oz bomber from Ron's in Farmington. Pours an opaque black body with an inch of tan head. Smells roasty with strong cocoa notes. Tastes very roasty with some grassy hops and strong cocoa notes, especially toward the finish. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. A superb stout in every way. Super tasty with just the right balance of flavors. A new favorite!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kyleec,4.82,"Poured from 22oz bottle into a goblet.  A: Deep black, nearly opaque with a burnt tan head that hangs around a little while.  S: Smeels of cacao, chocolate malts, roasted barley, maybe a little toffee.  T: Carbonation at first, but once it settles in the glass, fine dark chocolate, roasted grains, toffee and caramel, bitter with just enough sweetness to balance it out. Bitterness comes from the chocolate as much as the hops, which are present but subtle. Nice creamy finish.  M: Carbonation and cream.  D: Easy to drink one, but not two.  Overall: So far my favorite chocolate stout. Seems like it would go equally well with a uicy pok roast or a sweet dessert. Everything in this brew is so well-balanced. Top notch stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BMoney575,4.64,"Sampled on 6-29-08  Pours an absolute pitch black, with a thin tan head that tries to stick around.  Smell is unbelievable semi-sweet chocolate, sweet and bitter.  Taste is super chocolate. Very authentic chocolate flavor, not over sweet like some. Smooth and slightly bitter on the finish.  Mouthfeel is good, just a bit too thin to be awesome.  Drinkability is good, but I'm surprised at how the bitterness asserts itself after awhile.  Overall, the best chocolate stout ever.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Bitterbill,4.38,"The pour is a near pitch black but when I hold up my glass to the light, I can that it's a very dark brown. Big 2 finger+ head of tannish foam and there's plenty of sticky lacing. Awesome head retention and plenty of lacing.  The smell has oodles of both dark and milk chocolate tickling my nosebuds. Wow. Does this ever smell inviting!  And...the taste tells it all. Big baker's chocolate taste that literally has me grinning after every sip. Oh, there's definitely some sweeter milk chocolate flavour there as well but it's nicely countered by a very pleasant dryness coming from notes of coffee and a bit of toffee and that just kicks up the drinkability factor for me. Wow is this stuff good or what?  Good thick mouthfeel gives it a really creamy texture and the carbonation is low and perfect for this beer.  I've had this available locally a few years ago but I never got around to reviewing it so, I had to grab a bottle yesterday when I was in Ft Collins. I'm *so* glad I did!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,fitzy84,4.47,"Bought the 22 ounce bomber. The appearance was delicious: solid dark, brown head and creamy lacing. Aromas were particularly strong in a pure dark chocolate aroma, with hints of mocha, cocoa and toffee. Not too rich but very specific. Taste mirrored the hinted aromas even with the bitter, chocolate aftertaste. Now the mouthfeel does make it seem pretty frappey, but I felt it was way to bubbly and airy, almost like the consistency of a McDonald's milkshake. Overall, even with some texture issues, this is a brilliant chocolate stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Hoagie1973,4.32,"Appeared dark black with a filmy coffee colored head. Have to revisit this one to properly rate its appearance due to the fact that I had it on tap in an 8 ounce plastic cup on $1 draft night. However I had a few and there's plenty to talk about. Smells extremely chocolatey, I mean like real cocoa, not just chocolate malts. A discernable hop presence fights its way through. Flavor is rich and chocolatey, but not sweet. Actually very dry and powdery, like powdered bakers chocolate. Finish fades into a sharp and potent hop bitterness that hangs on the tongue until your next sip. This is a very dry beer, but intensley flavorful. Full bodied and creamy. Don't expect to quench your thirst with this one, but do expect an enjoyable experience.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,CrellMoset,4.17,"On tap at the Midlothian Capital Ale House.  Appearance: A deep, dark brown body with a tan head. Great retention, solid lacing that sticks all over the place. Very inviting looking.  Aroma: Whoa. There's that natural chocolate flavoring. Smells overwhelmingly of powdered hot cocoa - definitely bringing me back to my Boy Scout days. It's a little more complex than that though, to be fair - a milkyness is present, and there are saccharine notes that aren't just pure ""chocolate chocolate."" Very nice - smells like you'd imagine a chocolate stout should smell.  Taste: Here goes ... wow, not nearly as sweet as one would imagine from the smell. Everyone's had that powdered hot chocolate in their childhood, so you expect something much milky and sweeter when you sip this one. Not so. It's very dry, much more about the bitter, dark chocolate and other roasted malts than about milk chocolate. There are some pleasant bitter astringencies imparted by the roasted malts, and there's an ever-so-slight non-malt bitterness (the Cascade, I'm assuming, which also gives it a few earthy notes that I can't really attribute to the malts). Only the faintest hints of other Cascade notes detected though, which is good - I've never much liked chocolate oranges. Very rich, without being sweet.  Mouthfeel: Excellent - surprisingly big-bodied and bold (that big head from the oats?), which keeps it from being too thick, with expressive, even carbonation the smoothness of which lends a powdery feel (cocoa powder?) to the whole ordeal, although that may just be my imagination.  Drinkability: Great. It's big-bodied, but everything jives very well. It's not sweet at all, so nothing is cloying, nor is it overly bitter. The chocolate is always present, but it's really just the ""chocolate"" that's there ... hmmm ... that doesn't make much sense. I always grew up on milk chocolate (as did most people born in this day and age - you're not going to give dark chocolate to a child, right?), but this is that pure cocoa solid flavor, which works very well with all those other toasted malt notes. Very drinkable - pair it with a dessert.  Solid, solid beer. Flavor is solid and balanced, chocolate is powerful without being overpowering, and everything else in the supporting cast comes together nicely.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,csmiley,4.2,"A - Pours dark brown and opaque. Some hints of cola show around the edges of the glass. Head topped out at one inch and stuck around for longer than expected. The lacing left behind was nice.  S - Smokey roasted malt aromas come through first but do not dominate. Quickly behind are notes of maple and dark chocolate. Even though the chocolate comes in midway, it steals the show and sticks around once it shows up. Overall the aroma is mild and pleasing.  T - Chocolate. Dark and bitter at first but a smoother milk chocolate comes in later. Behind the chocolate lay some roasted malt and a hint of smoke. Finishing off the flavor was a small amount of alcohol and coffee.  M - Medium bodied with good carbonation. Silky feel. Finsh is bittersweet, clean, and does not stick around for long.  D - Drinkability is good. The beer is a good example of how to showcase the chocolate flavor. I would gladly have more of this one. The alcohol is relatively low which makes is disappear even faster.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,JayDub,4.18,"22oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  A - Extremely dark brown, only a hint of light at extreme edges. A dense, tightly packed, caramel colored head that settles to a nice sheet, and leaves a sticky lace all the way down.  S - Toasted malts, mollases, toffee, and obviously rich dark chocolate. It's a wonderfully inviting aroma.  T - More roasted malts, unsweetened dark chocolate, a hint of hop spiciness, and some dark fruit.  M - A creamy, medium-thick body that goes down with ease. A surpisingly clean and dry finish given the chocolate content. A fairly low level of carbonation brings just the right amount of bite.  D - Well, I drained the bomber in short time. I thought the chocolate content would slow me down, but not so. I'm not quite gonna call it sessionable, but it was a joy to drink. I will definately do this one again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,MrHungryMonkey,4.09,"I got it at Target.  Nose: Chocolate indeed! Richly roasted maltiness with dark roasted flavors, particularly chocolate (per suggestion) and espresso. Dark, ripe fruit. Vanilla, and an almost-lavender floralness.  Look: Jet black, perhaps dark, dark brown. Mild head - dark brown - with poor retention.  Flavor: First sip reveals abundant fruitiness in the attack, mild malt and hop in the midpalate, and a growing bitterness in the finish. Quite a transition and spectrum of flavors. Deeper chocolate and roasted malt develop against the fruit. Tart hop edge comes in between middle and end along with bright fruit through the finish. A little bit of spicy, herbal hop takes root and provides a nice, subtle foreground to the dark malty backgrounds. More bitterness in the end tastes mainly of hop leaf, but also perhaps from highly roasted malt. Vanilla suggestions turn into reckonable flavors and bring to mind oak. I only notice a very soft sweetness as an afterthought upon relishing in the finishing bitterness.  After reading the bottle, I see that there really is chocolate in here (along with oats, which kind of makes sense). I can't really tell that there is chocolate added beyond very richly roasted malt which often tastes chocolate-like to me. I'm glad Rogue didn't over do the chocolate, as that would have skewed these nice flavors down the path of being flavored.  Paired with some corned beef, marbled rye, and aged swiss, it does smell creamy like oats. And my corned beef, paired against Rogue Chocolate Stout, tastes rather like wintergreen. How odd - it tasted rather meaty a minute ago.  Feel: Medium-full-to-full bodied mouthfeel. Good bitterness, stiff body.  The Verdict: A pretty good, and indeed chocolate-rich, Stout with a surprisingly strong bright fruit character juxtaposed on the dark malt and a pleasantly strong bitterness ruling over the finish.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Matty1918,3.76,"poured from a bomber into a pint glass.  Pours black with a nice tan, creamy head. Nice lacing and retention.  Aroma is of toasted sweet malts....caramel with hints of chocolate.  Taste is of light coffee up front with chocolate bringing up the rear. A mild spice is also there. Lots of chocolate flavor here.  Mouthfeel is creamy very nice. Not a lot of carbonation. A nice stout to end the night with.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,srandycarter,4.4,"A - Dark, close to black, tan head, leaves eventually, persistent thin bubbly lacing.  S - Bakers chocolate, burnt malt and hops.  T - Wow. Chocolate is dominant, followed by burnt malt and grapefruit.  M - Thick, chewy beer. Nice balance, good carb, excellent coating.  D - I could go for a time with this. Reminds me of my own stout, which I am very partial to.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BamaBeerBuff,4.29,"A: Pours a deep, dark brown with leathery edges. A large cocoa colored head settles slowly and chaotically to a nice creamy cap, leaving some initial rings and sheets of lace.  S: Woah, strong bittersweet chocolate with a faint toasted malt aroma and some citrus hops. Absolutely fantastic aroma.  T&M: Sweet chocolate, citrus hops, and toasted black malt all make their appearance. Finish is long and lingering with all three primary flavor components, though a bit stronger on the roasted malt and chocolate. A medium/full body with slight amount of carbonation--helps those chocolate flavors stay smooth.  D: With so much flavor, it has to be drinkable. A smooth, creamy feel also adds enjoyability to the experience. Chocolate stout is one of the most unique beers I've ever drank, and would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,AmishT,4.4,"A - Huge mocha brown head that isn't goin anywhere fast. A little bit of lacing when it does decide to recede. Deep brown almost black. The color of the beer as it's poured from the bottle is definitely noteworthy.  S - Delicious aromas, a mixture of dark chocolate and earthy hops. Really invites you to take that first sip  T - Man, tastes like it smells, which is awesome. Hops and chocolate is a big win in my book. The bittersweet chocolaty/hoppy aftertaste is awesome; it really sets you up for that next sip. The chocolate and hop flavors are nicely balanced: just enough hops to remind you that you're drinkin a beer.  M - A little bit too light in my opinion. The rich chocolate flavors don't endure as well as I would like when held to my tongue. Slick. It's not a bad mouthfeel, it's just not what I personally would like in regards to the flavor profile  D - The lighter body definitely bolsters the drinkability. Fairly low abv, great flavor - it's a damn drinkable stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Thiestru,3.83,"Poured from a bottle into a pint-sized pub glass.  Appearance: Black as sin and completely opaque. Very respectable light brown head - it was three fingers when I first poured it! This diminished, but some head still lingered, lacing the glass thoroughly.  Smell: An intensely rich dark chocolate aroma leaps out at you from the moment you open the bottle.  Taste: Wow! I did not anticipate this kind of bitterness from a chocolate stout! This beer has something of a bite, which, strangely, doesn't seem to derive from the hops. Rather, it seems to be coming from the chocolate malt itself. I'm surprised at how little sweetness is to be found here. Definitely an interesting taste, if not quite what I want from a chocolate stout; but I think it might grow on me.  Mouthfeel: Full and creamy, but to be honest the provocative flavor distracts me from the mouthfeel.  Drinkability: I definitely wouldn't want more than one of these in a sitting; it's going to be hard just to finish this one. Doesn't mean I'm not enjoying it, though....",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Metalmonk,4.25,"Label notes this is 69 IBUs...not what I would've expected on something like this. I wish I wouldn't have peeked at Rogue's always uber-informative label. Could be a wonderful thing though...to the pour!  Pours an oily but not ultra-thick stream into the snifter, which boasts a light brown not unlike a lightly-toasted marshmallow. The color is a deep, dark brown, bordering on black, and the bubbles seem to take their time moving through the viscous liquid. Slabs of lace complete the very nice picture.  Too many American stouts concentrate solely on the stout part (ie. the dark/roasted grains), forgetting the nuances that make a great stout great. This one doesn't make that mistake, and it's obvious even in the aroma stage. The roasty, almost smoky stout-ness is here, but there's also some depth thanks to hops (nothing overboard), plum/grape-skin, cream/milk sweetness, and just enough chocolate to make good on the beer's name. Aroma could've been bigger, seems kind of held back, or tame, but hardly regrettable.  Flavor is outstanding, and it's all about balance. Chocolate is at the forefront, but not ludicrously cranked up. Carries lots of caramel on its back, which makes it feel like you're drinking Rolo candies. Chocolate and its pal Caramel get along well with the roasty-toasty grains (oats/barley noted on the label) and some obvious hops (Cascade...again, I cheated). Frothed milk seeps into the flavor, but could also partly be the texture talking. Lingering smoke and roast in the finish, which push the chocolate back a little--not surprising considering they're more aggressive flavors. Mouthfeel is decent, airy and silky, like any good stout, but thicker & creamier would've put this beer over the top. Think melted chocolate, and you have my expectation vs. the reality. If the texture of Bell's Expedition Stout could've been fused to this beer, we'd have a World-Class winner.  One of Rogue's best. There's little to nitpick about...this is hugely enjoyable, and highly drinkable considering the style.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RomanW70,4.29,"Pours dark brown with a tan head that disappates quickly. Strong aroma of chocolate, but with additinal notes of roasted coffee and licorice. Tatse of chocolate and hops which really shine through at the finish. Fairly well balanced. The chocolate malts are the highlight here, but the finish is bitter and lasting. One of Rogue's best beers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,stephens101,3.95,"Revisiting the Chocolate Stout after about a year. If memory serves me correct, it's one tasty SOB. A semi-hard pour reveals a very dark brown, almost black brew with a rolling and dense dark tan head that carries itself proud to a slow finish and leaves a good lacing all around to remind you of itself. Smell is quite complex with sweet and dark chocolates, malts and caramel upfront and an essence of burnt wood and pine in the background. Tastes of dark chocolates, molasses, licorice, toffee and a good hit of bitterness and some slight smokiness to finish things off. Carbonation is just right for this medium to full-bodied, yet highly drinkable stout. Rogue always does me right.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

There's a distinct roasted malt flavor that's buttery with a hint of coffee. It has a rather strong aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very thick without much carbonation.

132,1118,ommegoose,4.18,"$6.00 bomber from Evanston First Liquors.  Looks great. Pours out a viscous dark black, more than lots of impy stouts, with a full dark head. Impressive color on the head. Full 360 degree lacing. At the end the sediment doesn't look too nice, and is not expected in this style.  Milky chocolately aroma. Smells nice, Tootsie Roll like. It's not terribly complex. Sweetness covers up roasty or bitter notes.  There's a lot of interest out there in chocolate stouts, it seems, and this one is named often. After just a few sips, it's easy to see why. Plenty of flavor for a beer that is not that big in terms of abv. Whereas the nose was pretty one-dimensional, there's plenty going on on the palate. The suggestion of chocolate in the nose leads you to find that right away, but there's a smooth foundation of roasted oats and barley, followed by a generous amount of hop bitterness. I found it a bit much initially, but I got used to it after a few sips. The chocolate flavor is nice, and the clear focus over coffee or roasty notes. Finishes a bit on the bitter side, with lingering dark chocolate.  I was looking for something fuller in the mouthfeel. Seems to dissolve in the mouth, when I'm looking for it to be heavier and just sit there.  Drinkability is hurt a little by a lack of crispness and a finish so long that you always feel like you just took a sip. This is a very solid beer, but to be honest, it gets a little boring near the end of the bomber. I don't know if I'll purchase again anytime soon, but I still recommend it to stout lovers. Of course you already know that it's good anyway. Still doesn't beat the mighty Choklat in my book.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,wiseguy142,4.58,"What a wonderful beer. Deep milk chocolate permeates almost every aspect of the beer- from the taste to the aroma, and even the mouthfeel is like drinking a hearty chocolate milk that is just perfect. My one complaint is that I wasn't able to directly discern the hop contribution to the beer because the chocolate flavor and aroma was so great. Maybe there isn't one or maybe it's not needed. I'll leave it until my next try to decide, but this is certainly a great one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

If you say it smells like something else, you're a f&*king liar! LIAR!!!  Taste: Definitely tastes like chocolate. To be specific, this tastes like liquid Tootsie Roll and roasted malts, dark chocolate and oats. Quite delicious.  Mouthfeel: creamy with medium carbonation (high carbonation for a chocolate stout). Taste coats the mouth, however aftertaste was a bit disapointing (just a little bit).  Drinkability: I wouldn't want to drink any chocolate stout all night, however this is the mother of all chocolate stouts. This beer sets the standard for all other chocolate stouts I've tried and will try. Rogue did not disappoint with this one.  NOTE: One wise man couldn't finish his Rogue Chocolate Stout.

T: The taste is a strong mixture of milk and dark chocolate. It's very malty and bitter-sweet. A very mild hops presence comes in after a while but for the most part this beer tastes like a melted chocolate bar leaving that thick cloying sweetness in the after-taste.  M: Very smooth with a little crispness, medium-heavy body, light-medium carbonation, finish is very sticky.  D: Tasty if you like the intense chocolate, goes down ok, slightly filling, decent kick, good representation of style, I've had some chocolaty stouts before but I think this one overdoes it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Taste is roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate balanced with some earthy hops. There's some milky sweetness in the middle before a long, semi-dry chocolate finish.

The feel is smooth,milky like,medium carbonation with a creamy texture and a slight bitter finish.  Notes: I was expecting this brew to be heavy,to be too full flavored or just too sweet. What a surprise ! Balance was awesome and the drinkability was so close to session. I suppose it may be a session brew because it is not too heavy and the ABV is not so high.

132,1118,Ben4881,4.3,"Chocolate Stout Rogue Ales Brewery  Appearance: This beer pours out dark, thick, with an impenetrable blackness. A lovely head foams to the surface, brown at the bottom and egg shell white on top. Looks almost like a root beer float. The head sinks fast and leaves almost no remnants of lacing on the glass. Some lacing remains as the glass empties, however.  Smell: A very soft chocolaty smell creeps into my nose. There is some toasty character to it, but not overpoweringly so. Mostly, the smell is very sweet and chocolaty smooth.  Taste: This is a creeper. The taste begins very soft chocolaty and sweet, like the smell. Then, a milky flavor hangs as I swallow. Upon swallowing, an unexpected kick back of hops tickles the back of my tongue. The slightly sticky, dry, and bitter aftertaste is a welcome surprise. This beer finishes in a different place from where it started.  Mouthfeel: As a stout, it is appropriately thick. There is some carbonation, which lightens the load. Not too chunky, pretty smooth.  Drinkability: The complexity of the taste from start to finish is a plus. The dry, bitter finish makes me want to experience the silky, sweet, chocolaty all over again.

This beer pours like crude oil looks like dark chocolate and tastes like guess what? chocolate. and its wonderful. dont get me wrong you can tell the difference between this and a chocolate milk. You take your everyday coffee hinted stout give it rogue quality and add a bit more than a hint of chocolate and here we are. this stuff is way ahead of guinness in my book. doesnt have the slightest flat waterdown taste that you expect with an average stout. Very filling ive had a few 22s of the stuff and cant wait to get more. pace yourself and enjoy this one,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S - smells of chocolate and malt.  T - a bit of coffee at first while cold then the chocolate became more pronounced. as it warmed the chocolate came forward a bit more and started to stand out. this is on of the first chocolate stouts i've had where i felt the chocolate presence was this strong.

132,1118,Kemmerlin,4.65,"A: Poured a two finger width foamy head that left good lacing down the glass and had a dark chocolate brown color.  S: Had aromas of chocolate brownies, hops, toffee, and slight coffee.  T: Really chocolatey and not the typical from the syrup can chocolatey with a hoppy and coffee taste. A smoked cigar after taste graces the remainder of the beer that keeps on giving.  M/D: Heavy but not brainy like typical stouts slightly bitter and of course has pretty good sweetness. The beer is dangerously drinkable and would go well with any dessert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,pokesbeerdude,4.28,"I've been curious about this since Christmas time so I bought it, and forgot I had it in the fridge. We'll see what happens.  A: Poured from a 22oz bomber, very dark brown, almost black. Almost completely opaque when held to the light, a few redish brown hints around the edges big tall tan head, almost sand colored, reduced from about two inches in my hofbrau mug to roughly a half inch. Delicious looking stout, great head retention.  S: The darker roasted malts really pop out on this one, as well as a Hershey's syrup smell. Smells a lot like beer thats still in the brewing process, pretty interesting.  T: Chocolatey sweetness at the very front which leads into the bitterness from the burnt malts, nice clean hop finish at the end which is refreshing with such a thick beer. The hops actually linger in the mouth, with a nice citrusy bite, lingering coffee bitterness and of course sweet chocolate. Not as sweet as I expected, but that's ok.  M: Smooth and very creamy. Just a little bit of a bite from the light carbonation, this is very sticky in the mouth as well. Lots of sugars in this one.  D: This is definitely a dessert beer, I can't think of any other time that I would like to drink this other than after dinner. It is pretty heavy, and rich, but very good, but one is definitely enough for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

This one was head and shoulders better. More chocolate flavor, more chocolate aroma, better roasted malt flavor as well. Hops in perfect balance, understated (especially for Rogue) but adequate.

132,1118,jessecarr,3.95,"I love Rogue beers--to me, many of them straddle the fine line between experimentation and execution. This beer is very well executed.  On the heels of tasting many imperial-styled stouts, this bomber reminded me that stouts can be very rewarding--even when they don't blow you away with 12% alcohol.  You can't aggressively pour this beer into a pint glass. It leaves a huge head that doesn't settle. I learned that quickly. But the smell was clean, even minerally.  It gets to be a bit watery as the bomber empties, but the mouthfeel and taste are fantastic. It has a chocolate taste that hides during the swallow and doesn't peek out until a few seconds afterwards. It also leaves a very smooth aftertaste--something I hadn't tasted for a while in a stout. (my one beer with imperial stouts is their bitter, dry aftertaste)  Congrats, Rogue. You keep impressing me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jayrod20,3.88,"Rogue Chocolate Stout pours a rich dark brownish black with a nice lingering head. The smell is strong of chocolate after the initial pour, but fades quickly. It has a nice taste, unfortunately it is accompanied by a rather non pleasant bitter aftertaste. This fades slightly as the beer warms. Bitterness and high carbonation is what stands out most to me in the mouthfeel. Drinkability wise I expected this to be less bitter, I guess thats why I keep on getting it. Overall its not bad, but I do think there are better Chocolate Stouts out there.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bkilpatr,3.82,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. 04/05/08.  Pours nearly pitch black, slight brownish hue. Nearly three fingers of fluffy light brown head, which leaves nice lacing around the glass. Aroma is amazing. Sweet, sugary milk chocolate. Finally, a chocolate stout that actually smells like chocolate.  Taste is very interesting. I get lots of bitter dark chocolate, and little bits of creamy milk chocolate. I was hoping for a bit more of the milk chocolate, but overall the chocolate flavor is definitely there. Nice roasted malt flavors, and a bit of piney hops in the finish.  Mouthfeel is disappointing. For a chocolate stout I was expecting something smooth and creamy. But this is much too carbonated. The chocolate aroma and taste are there, but not the smooth and creamy feel. Drinkability is decent though, it's not too thick and the ABV is relatively low (6%).  A pretty good chocolate stout, but would be MUCH better if they lower the carbonation and smooth it out a bit.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S- Smells mostly of chocolate with a hint of vanilla.  T- Tastes like eating a chocolate bar with a hop filled aftertaste.  MF- Very creamy in the mouth and not as thick as you would expect. Low in carbonation, which makes it easy to drink.  D- Very drinkable for a chocolate stout. However, I still could only drink a few before switching to something else. Would be a great after dinner drink to finish off the night.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,cjohnson,3.87,"Pours a near black body with a slightly reddish tinge around the edges with a surprisingly small head that went away quickly, but left some respectable lacing.  Smells predominantly of chocolate, but also a little bit of coffee and just a tiny hint of vanilla.  The first thing I thought when I drank this was how chocolatey it was; it was almost like drinking a Hershey's bar. The taste goes back and forth between bitter, dark chocolate and sweeter milk chocolate. The finish is a nice little bit of hoppiness.  The mouthfeel of this beer is a bit disappointing: it doesn't quite ""match up"" with the taste. It's certainly not ""bad,"" but would have been a lot better if it were creamier.  Still, all in all this is a pretty drinkable beer. I probably wouldn't want more than two back to back, and having something else in between to break up the strong chocolate taste wouldn't be a bad idea.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Avryle,4.48,"One of my favorite chocolate stouts out there & now its going to make my evening of reviewing other people's problems, that much better... Why won't they just let me drink in the office???  A- pours a thick black (no light getting through this one!) with a 1"" mocha colored head on a vigorous pour. Head disipates to a mocha-colored cap that leaves intricate lacing through all 22 ounces of goodness  S- Rich chocolatey malts bitch slap you right away. Some nice hints of caramel & vanilla as well  T- Bittersweet chocolate, cocoa & caramel wiht a slightly bitter cocoa & hop finish.  M- A little lighter than I like in my stouts which make it more easily consumable than is probably good for me or my liver. Pretty active carbonation too. Mouthfeel is the one shortcoming of this beer, but even its not ""bad.""  D- As stated before, the body is a bit thinner than many stouts making this maybe a little too drinkable. Is that possible?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S: Sweet, chocolate, and malts, with a little vanilla.  T: Boom! Tons of chocolate up front and at the end, with the malts coming in during the middle. Almost like a milkshake as opposed to a beer!  MF/D: Creamy texture, low carbonation, I personally found this to be EXTREMELY drinkable. I'd read in other reviews that this isn't a session beer, but I disagree, I had four of these before I knew what was going on (probably down to my wife helping herself every time my back was turned.) Excellent beer which I thoroughly enjoyed, so much so there's a growler of it sitting in my fridge. (Ooh, speaking of which...!)",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,yemenmocha,4.76,"Pours opaque black with off brown/tan head that retains well.  Nose has a nougat-chocolate character that is very enticing.  On the palate the roasted malts, multi-chocolate flavours dominate, and hops are noticeable in the background to keep things from getting out of hand.  One of the most drinkable chocolate stouts I've ever had.  The chocolate components are truly some of the best around.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Pencible,4.64,"This poured out thick with a little bit of very dark brown head. It had a chocolaty scent, and a flavor to match. It tasted like a liquid bar of dark chocolate. Like chocolate milk, but beer. It was slightly bitter, but very drinkable. It had a good texture, and was just plain tasty. One of the best stouts I've ever had, if you're in the mood for chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,rye726,4.18,"Near black, dark brown color with a silky espresso head.  Complex profile of burnt, black and chocolate malts. Also a sweet fudgy aroma.  Not as sweet as I woud have thought. The chocolate is more bitter like raw cacoa. There is also a nice malt structure balanced by piney hops.  Full body and good carbonation. A very drinkable stout. No artificial flavoring here. This was good, but is much better fresh on tap. On nitro, this is close to a perfect beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,deltatauhobbit,3.95,"Pours a dark brown/black color, very little light being able to shine through (only on the edges), perfect sized head with great retention and some lacing.  Smell is quite sweet, finally a chocolate stout that intensely smells of chocolate, the chocolate aroma seems more like powdered cocoa that you'd make chocolate milk with.  Taste is bitter up front, the sweetness from the nose is lost on the taste, but not entirely when it finished with a chocolate aftertaste, the carbonation is killer though, definitely needs to be toned down a bit as it ruins the creaminess of this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

M - Bit too carbonated for me. Not as creamy as I'd like.  D - Fairly good. A bottle was no trouble.  You can taste the chocolate for sure. Would be good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

S - Malty, sweet chocolate aroma with slight hints of spice and ripe fruit.  T - Sweet and chocolaty up front, followed by a smokey slightly bitter and somewhat metallic finish. The taste of this stout became more pronounced as it warmed up.  MF&D - Medium/Full bodied stout. Sticky and chewy mouthfeel.

S- Roasted coffee/espresso mingled with dark chocolate. Smokey wood with chocolate, makes me think of camping and S'mores.  T- Bittersweet dark chocolate with that smokey woodiness. Ends with a creamy chocolate milkiness.  M- Smooth, creamy. great carbonation that is crisp and soft in the same swallow.  D- This is one of my favorite styles, and this is a great representative.

Chocolate malt infussed! I think my nose is in a fancy chocoalte factory.  Tastes of dark bitter chocolate. (a good thing). Creamy as this warms up. Some alcoholic flavors. A great balance of sweet malts and bitterness.  Creamy and sugary mouthfeel that coats the pallet of chocolate malt like flavors. I am drinking this AS desert. It is incredible by itself. Another flavored offering by this brewery, I did not care for. This one. Hell yeah!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,KingPuuChuu,4.48,"It's no secret I love Stout.  This stout is one of the finest I have had. It pours an incredible black, when you shine it up to the light, the light vanishes. The head is pretty frothy, and releases a pleasant aroma of chocolate, more specifically, cocoa.  Upon first sip, I was taken aback, being hit with a heavy flavor, it was almost too much. Almost.  As the beer started to warm up, it's drinkability soared through the roof, and the characteristics came through. The beer had notable hints of citrus, which matched well with the chocolate.  I enjoyed this beer with some vanilla bean ice cream, which I found to be an excellent pairing.  On the mouthful angle, I would say that 1 bottle is enough, because of how beefy the beer is. With that negative out of the way, another awesome beer from Rouge. Cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,zdk9,4.12,"A- Pours black, as in black, as in no light of day will ever penetrate this beer. There's about a half finger of cocoa colored head and some light lacing, nothing drastic.  S- When cold the beer emits smells of milk chocolate, that strongly remind me of cadbury eggs, very milky with a sweetness that's smooth and natural. There's also some hints of citrusy hops, tart orange, and weak grapefruit. As the beer warms I get more dark fruit and brown sugar coming off it. Quite an enjoyable smell, and nice complexity.  T- Again the most prominent taste is the substantially milky chocolate which is great tasting. This is one beer which I can really appreciate the real chocolate that's used. Hops are there, adding to the complexity of the taste, but playing second fiddle.  M- Smooth and creamy, like thick whole chocolate milk down my throat. Alcohol get's somewhat pronounced especially when warmer.  D- Complex, delicious. This is certainly a great dessert beer, but there's quite a bit of chocolate flavor, so I can see getting tired of it.

132,1118,Sebletitje,4.6,"I would put this Rogue beer on top of my favourite chocolate beers. Right along with Lost Coast Chocolate Porter.  The joy began right after opening the bottle. It pours a dark body and thick head that settled rather quickly. Full body / chocolate smell is heavily present right after opening and in the glass. It has a nice smell that does not overtake the quality of the beer. A very enjoyable beer, very smooth, full chocolate body, does not leave any bad aftertaste. A near perfect mix of chocolate malt and barley.  A good beer to share with people interested in discovering something new and appealing. Have yet to find any food I could pair it with. I thought about trying saltine with good Belgian chocolate, but was afraid it might ruin the enjoyment of the beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Gehrig,4.8,"Since I was making jambalaya tonight for a potluck lunch tomorrow, I figured a top-of-the-line beer would go well with preparation and sampling. Chocolate Stout more than fits the bill. Two dense fingers of dark mocha froth top a deep ebony body, gorgeous. Thick lacing rings the DAB mug. Plenty of chocolate in the aroma, but caramel, molasses, and coffee also greet the nose.  The taste is simply divine. More complicated and balanced than Ommegang's own delicious Chocolate Stout, this creamy concoction is a dream beer for the palate. The sweetness has a nice complement in the coffee, with neither overwhelming the other. Chocolate is in charge, but not to such a degree that it displaces the other essential flavors. Spot on.  This is an extremely easy beer to enjoy, and worth grabbing a second. Big and smooth, this is certainly my favorite from Rogue. Outstanding.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S - All kinds of chocolate milk, dark, and cream with a bit of a caramel accent. T - Dispite the scent it is all deep dark chocolate in this one with a slight hop almost piney ending. M - Lighter then I thought it would be but not a bad thing. Carbonation was in proper balance with the style, present but not overbaring. D - Awesome brew and with the low alcohol content it makes a welcome addition to any session brew schedule.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smell is minor, getting very lite, almost hot chocolate smells, not as heavy as I expected.Tingaling on the tongue with a very nice chocolate after taste. This coming from someone that isn't a chocolate fan. Finish is a bit watery, slightly bitter. The roasted malt, smoky flavors really came out towards the end and when the beer warmed up.

The beer poured very dark almost black with no light shining through and a little over a 1 finger high dark tan head. Smell of chocolate is very apparent over everything else. The taste is great. A dry bitter chocolate taste with a good finish that gets easier to drink as you drink more. Good finish and very nice mouth feel with the right amount of carbonation. Very much recommend this to anyone looking for a chocolate stout to try.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ElGrecoVerde,3.83,"Poured dark brown, almost black, with a frothy tan head. It looks like black milk.  Smell is, surprise, chocolaty. You can tell they use real chocolate in the process, and not fake chocolate flavors.  Ready for a double wow? Taste is chocolaty too! Very creamy, very chocolaty, with some bitter dark cocoa following. There's a bit too much of the sweeter milk chocolate flavors, which I could go without, but overall it's well balanced.  It finishes clean, taking care of some of the rich flavors and making it fairly drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,clayrock81,4.25,"Poured the bomber bottle into my mug and received a one-finger frothy head that slowly died, leaving small lacings. This sat on what was essentially a black body that you could barely see through when held up to the light. Not to be redundant, but the smell is chocolatey. I mean, there are hints of other malts in there and hops, but putting my nose in my glass was akin to unwrapping a chocolate bar and smelling it. Not only does the beer have a very pronounced chocolate taste, but it has a dryer feel to it, as if there were coffee and/or roasted malts in it. A smooth beer overall with some hop catching you on the backbite. I detected mild fruit flavors, but that could be my imagination. I just wish Rogue would sell this in six-pack form rather than just the bomber bottle.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Oats mellow the flavor somewhat, but only a little.  Not really my bag.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

This beer is opaque; I held it right up to a light bulb and no light comes through whatsoever.  Smells like cocoa, dark roasted coffee, caramel.  Taste is immediately dark bittersweet chocolate, like natural unsweetened cocoa, then malty, roasted coffee. Nicely balanced with a hop finish.  Mouthfeel is smooth, not to heavy, light to medium carbonation. Surprisingly light-bodied for such a dark beer.  This is a surprisingly drinkable beer for it's color!

T: The carbonation hits your tongue, and while you are letting the beer roll around on your tongue, the beautiful roasted malts come out. The malts are quite nice and refreshing; however, the chocolate rests on your tongue and it begs you to drink more. I figured there would be more chocolate in this beer, but it's still god damn tasty.  M: Thick as fuck. This feels like you can eat it with a spoon!  D: Incredibly drinkable considering it's thickness. I'm sure that after 2 or 3 pints, I'll be full, but I'd still want another!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smell: The first smell was full of malt tones with some slight hints of toffee. My first thought was ""wow....they found a way to make a beer that tastes like an ice cream sunday"". I'm getting very excited!!  Taste: The frist sip had hints of un-sweatened chocolate. Soon after the toffee flavor fights it's way back to the palate. A slight hop bitterness is present and it finds a great way to mixs with the chocolate/toffee flavors.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth as it rolls across my mouth. The carbonation is definitely noticable, but not too overpowering.  Drinkability: I think it goes without saying that if a beer reminds me of a sunday....it's very drinkable.

The head was about 1 1/2 fingers of creamy tan that slowly diminished to a thin ring. A very slight amount of foam clung to the glass. It smelled of dark roasted malts with a subtle sweet chocolate aroma, and a bit of alcohol towards the end. The taste was very rich in dark malt and chocolate, with a small amount of alcohol in the finish. It wasn't as thick as I would like and quite a bit more carbonated than I am used to in a stout.

The chocolate wafted its way to brain in no time and was intoxicating. The flavor was supreme for an American Stout.

It drinks like Luvel chocolate milk, except not sugary and with a most welcome flavor of hops and a slight coffee intro. Delicious bittersweet finish.  M: Excellent. As I said before, it's akin to drinking bittersweet, beer-flavored chocolate milk.  D: Very high drinkability. Could easily enjoy this all night long.  I appreciate stouts ranging from the kick-in-the-nuts of a RIS like Old Rasputin to the creamy drinkability of Guinness draft. This offering from Rogue is just about a perfect combination of complexity of taste and repeat-drinkability. Will definitely order again...and again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,Ryanbob,4.92,"This beer appears black and pours a thick head that doesn't last long, but leaves lace on the glass. It smells like Count Chockula or nestle quick mix, chocolatey goodness. The tastes are cocoa, oats, tons of malts, a bit of hoppy bitterness, and more chocolate. It finishes with a nice roasty, cocoa flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth, thick, chewy, velvety, and tiny bubbles. My favorite chocolate stout so far, this beer is delicious, rich, and so smooth it can creep up on you.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mwilbur,4.65,"Poured from bottle into pint glass. A: Very dark smooth brown color. Creamy dark tan head. S: Roasted malt, coffee, and dark chocolate aroma. Dark, smooth, and sweet. T: The roasted malt hits first--a little sharp bite too--which gives way to soft chocolate notes, dark roast coffee, and a hint of caramel. Finishes in the trademark smooth fashion of Rogue's darker offerings. The more you drink, the bite falls away and chocolate takes over as the dominant flavor. Simply wonderful. M: Quick bitter note--similar to unsweetened cocoa, followed by nothing but silky smooth texture. D: Very! Nice as a dessert beer, on it's own to savor, or even has good sessionability. Another excellent beer from Rogue. One would think with all their offerings they would lose some quality, but this is definitely not the case!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smooth. A beauty.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Deep hop bite and chicory-style bitterness. Nice and dry. Unsweetened chocolate is almost perfectly balanced with hearty toasted-grain malt profile.  Just enough carbonation to wake up the palate that little extra. Feels like ice cream on the back of the mouth.  Easy to drink-more of a sipper of course. I tried other chocolate stouts and chocolate imperial stouts and was not prepared for the awesome balance of this. Excellent stuff.

132,1118,manleyphoto,3.22,"As a rule I'm not the biggest fan of Rogue brews. Not because they make bad beer, on the contrary, their beer is pretty good. I'm not the biggest Rogue fan because I believe they are not living up to their potential. Rogue makes a staggeringly large array of beers, in just about every style. They use unique ingredients and bold flavorful malts that generally make their beer pretty good. But that's just it, Rogue makes good beer, but I think they could be making great beer. There is almost always one thing about each of their beers that doesn't agree with my sensibilities. Sometimes it's a thin body, or sometimes a funny flavor that lingers through the aftertaste. Chocolate Stout is a beer that is changing my mind about Rogue. This beer is a strange brew that is oddly satisfying. The beer pours a deep black with a dark tan head and a profound aroma of cocoa. This beer hit me on three distinct levels with every sip. Like clockwork: one, two, three. The first taste is a deep rich bitter chocolate mixed with a vague toasted malt and coffee flavor. The dark chocolate gives way almost immediately to a tart liquid-citrus in the middle taste which again leaves quickly. The final stage of the taste for me is the most interesting. The easy drinking citrus disappears into a smooth aftertaste that I can only really describe as tasting like a boozy version of Yoo-Hoo Chocolate Drink. This beer is a vehicle for chocolate and the chocolate is definitely the star. I don't know that I could drink more than one of these at a time, but as a dessert, this beer works wonders. Every time I discount Rogue beers, they seem to come up with another one that gives me hope. I hope they continue experimenting to come up with more beer that truly lives up to their potential.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,aquaderek,4.28,"Poured from the bottle into my tasting glass. Very dark brown, not quite black, with a 1 1/2"" tan head. The nose is count chocolate, think of sticking your nose in a cup of hot chocolate. There is a little more going on in the nose, but the chocolate almost overpowers. The taste is a creamy wonderful chocolate stout, first the flavor of sweet chocolate, followed by fruity hop type flavor, rounded out but alcohol warming and a slight bitterness, like eating dark chocolate. Good stout if you are a fan of chocolate, like I am. I gonna drink one or two this evening.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RyanPB,4.7,"Magnificent. Simply fantastic. Pours a nice dark chocolate brownish-black with a small, dark tan head. The nose hints at the forthcoming chocolate. The taste is tremendous. If you like chocolate, Southern Tier's Imperial Choklat is the only thing I've had in the neighborhood. In terms of mouthfeel, it was pleasantly bubbly without turning into champagne. As for drinkability, I had to fight off friends to whom I offered a taste. I will buy this each time I see it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,blatherbeard,3.86,"I have to say, i am very dissapointed. This review differs from my other review of the chocolate stout as its in a bottle not from a tap.  I was dissapointed to find that i could NOT smell the chocolate at all in this bottled version. Taste is still of chocolate, but it takes a few minutes to find your taste buds. Theres a more caramel taste here than chocolate this time. Still, no bitterness so that does excite me. If you sit and just taste, you definetly get more of the chocolate taste coming. Pouring was still the same, nearly black with a mousse head.  I would still buy a bottle or 2 but it gets expensive as nobody sells them in builk and by the bottle its INSANELY priced.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jaxon53,3.28,"Served this at just about cellar temperature, into a pint glass, from a twenty two ounce brown bottle.  Appearance: This one pours out a deep midnight black, that looks to be like a spent motor oil, and not a single ray of light could pass through. About two and a half fingers of mocha brown head formed. Head was thick and creamy and just seemed to hang there forever. Great head retention leaves generous gobs of thick lace behind.  Smell: Aroma is thick with milky chocolate, some roasted/toasted malts and oat aromas. A bit of licorice and brown sugar are in there as well along with a hint of hops. The aroma of this beer is quite strong.  Taste: I really prefer the smell of this beer to the taste. The choclate isn't really rich and creamy like it is in the smell, and has an almost burnt flavor to it. A bit of coffee and caramel come out from the background. A rich maltiness with just a touch of hops. Not quite what I expected, I guess my expectations were set a bit high.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is very thin. No chewiness or thickness here. Almost watery.  Drinkability: Decent drinkability, but lacking some body here. A very middle of the road in my opinion.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The nose is big sweet chocolate bars with a nice amount of citric hops, and some roasted malts thrown in for the hell of it. Not quite as sweet in the taste but the chocolate is definitely still there. Black and roasted malts come in as well, along with cocoa and citric hops in a light, bitter finish. Medium-full in body with lush and creamy carbonation. If you are a fan of chocolate, or a fan of beer; you will enjoy this one.

Smells of chocolate and a hint of herbal hops. Tastes of dark chocolate truffles, with coffee, citrus, and hops as well. Bitterness is excellent and balances out the malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and rich, good carbonation levels. Due to all of the above, this is quite a drinkable beer. One of the best stouts I've had, as the chocolate adds a great flavor to this Ale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Really, it smells of cocoa powder, or the sugar free mocha syrup that we use at work (Starbucks). A very slight twang of the alcohol as well.  T: Wonderful dessert chocolate flavor, but not very sweet. A roasted flavor is present, and there's a tartness from the malt and alcohol that reminds of the kind of tart berries that pair well with chocolate.  M: Not too terribly thick, but the roasted chocolate flavor stays in the mouth for a good period of time. The tartness of the alcohol and oh-so-slight hops bitterness finish.  D: It's a really ""fun"" beer to drink. As has been recommended on the site before, it would do very well as a lone-standing dessert or paired with a chocolate-based dessert.

The smell was a deep dark chocolate. As i drank more the glass allowed the odors to concentrate in the glass. Smells of caramel, chocolate and pecan started to develop. I love pecan pie, and these scents really stood out to me. (the next time i drink this beer i will do so from a tulip, or only fill the glass 1/2 full in order to get the full effect).  Taste was like a dessert in a bottle. Rich and chocolaty, with some hops bite in the swallow.  Mouthfeel was world class. Smooth and velvety. I found myself swishing this one around.  Good drinkability, but i think this beer is better savored than guzzled, so this area doesn't really apply to me.

A few notes of hops balance out the sweetness quite well. Im also detecting some faint aromas of mint and oatmeal cookies. As it warms up the chocolate dominates even more and it smells like Nestle Quick.  The taste is a little bitterer than I expected. Dark, bitter chocolate with a dry cocoa aftertaste. A little minty as well and quite a lot of roasted barley. Some hoppy bitterness in the middle and end of the palate. Earthy finish.  Mouthfeel is just a tad too thin for my liking and too carbonated.

An aggressive earthy malt Hersey's dark chocolate mocha character that leads you to believe that there is serious sweetness to follow. The mouth feel is adequately carbonated with a solid note of hops. Full bodied and full flavored, the roast mocha comes out from beneath the semi-sweet chocolate taste and lingers nicely. A very good drinker with a lot to consider. IMO quite similar to ST Choklat. Enjoy!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,erosier,4.79,This is one excellent beer. It pours a beautiful black from the bottle with a nice thick tan colored head. The aroma is of roasted malts and chocolate. It really is a nice aroma to start the beer to. The taste is excellent with roasted malts as a nice base followed by a the chocolate flavoring the aroma promised. The chocolate flavoring is perfectly balanced with the roasted malts for the right amount of bittersweet chocolate flavor.

I was so excited to drink it after smelling it, so I was so disappointed when...  T:...the taste was overwhelmingly bitter. It was so bitter that I couldn't taste any sweetness at all. I let it warm up a bit and ate some pizza to try and tease out some flavors, but got nothing. All I could taste was bitter, bitter, and more bitter aftertaste lingering on my tongue, so that I didn't even look with delight to the next sip. All I kept thinking was, ""well, I gotta finish the beer.""  M: It's smooth, like Guinness, and almost as thick and heavy as a Gunness. It wasn't heavily carbonated at all.  D: The bitter aftertaste was just too much for me. I finished the bottle only because I hate to waste beer. I've tasted great chocolate stouts, and I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone.

It has a nice taste, unfortunately it is accompanied by a rather non pleasant bitter aftertaste. This fades slightly as the beer warms.

Lacing was thick and strong though.  Whoa, the nose is all semi-sweet chocolate. It's not bad, but I seriously can't find anything else in there. Bit milky I guess.  The taste is a pleasant, creamy dark chocolate, backed up quickly by coffee. The rear is brought up by an earthy hop flavor, which provides a nice balance to a truly delicious beer. I've had my share of chocolate, vanilla, maple, etc. stouts and porters and this is beautifully strong and balanced at the same time.  The mouthfeel is exceptional. There's just enough carbonation to cut the thickness, but it's pleasantly thick and very appropriate for the style.  Drinkability is very good for the style. I'd much rather have several dry well balanced stouts like this than some of the over-done half-candy flavored stouts I've had lately.  What a great chocolate stout.

There is good head retention and lacing, and as already noted, the beer looks impressive. The nose is pretty complex on this beer, with obvious chocolate, but with some underlying citrusy bitterness. The beer really doesn't smell very malty and/or sweet, and as it turned out, it wasn't. On the palate this beer is pretty intriguing. On the initial taste the chocolate flavor is really in your face, but after that I didn't notice it so much. The chocolate, along with what sweetness there is, can be tasted on the front palate, but then the hops come on strong, leading to a very dry, somewhat citrusy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is pretty good, though it doesn't have the plush creaminess of Stone RIS, KBS or Dark Lord, to name a few. The beer finishes very nicely, and given the relatively low alcohol, I found the beer to be pretty drinkable. There is a touch of licorise and burnt toast at the very end, which is really the only detraction in this otherwise very impressive beer from Rogue.

Taste is milk chocolate, maybe a bit of roasted malt (the chocolate is completely overwhelming), and a horrible, horrible bitter after-taste. It's actually giving me a stomach ache. I don't know what it is, but the sensation I'd describe is that it is like drinking burnt, bitter chocolate in liquid form. Oddly enough, this is layered over an increasingly cloying chocolate sweetness.  I drainpour a beer basically never (Samuel Adams Triple Bock being the other example I can think of).

I poured from a bottle into my new Rogue goblet provided by my wife as a Christmas gift. The apperance is dark, definitely a little thicker than average beer, with a dark coffee color.  The smell was not strong, but it was nice. It had a nice aroma of Chocolate, but I could certainly smell some hops in there too.  The taste was perfect. I'm not even a fan of chocolate and this was delightful. It was not overwhelmingly chocolate, but definitely a hint under the hops and malt.  It was a little thicker than some other beers, but not like a Guiness. It was not as thick as milk. That was nice, because darker beers tend to be a bit heavier and this was not too heavy to drink the full 22 oz. bottle in one setting.  This was quite drinkable. As I mentioned I didn't have any problem finishing the full bottle and a full meal. I would recommend this to anyone who likes fine beers.  Overall, this is a great beer.

There is a roast bitterness in the taste, but I think some of that bitterness comes from the chocolate as well. I once homebrewed a chocolate stout with pure cacao nibs, and this has that taste that I got. Taste has some hops in it as well as that silky chocolate taste.

132,1118,DoubleJ,4.24,"Served on-tap in a tulip during my visit at the Sunset Grill & Tap, on to the beer:  I got very little head in my glass and little lacing, but the body is pitch black and intiminating. The smell is extremely inviting, lots of sweet milk chocolate. From the aroma, I was guessing I would be drinking a chocolate shake, but my minor complaint is you can only taste the chocolate towards the end of the sip. It starts out like a stout, roasted bitterness and coffee, before you get to the gold, which is the chocolate. Despite the thick appearance, it goes down easy. I can't say I was dissapointed, I just was expected a different journey in the taste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,AKBelgianBeast,3.88,"The stout pours black with thin tan head, quickly dissipates into a ring. The nose is chocolate and coffee. Dark chocolate. At first taste the coffee seems stronger to me than the chocolate. Coffee bean, chocolate and some toffee. a bit of smoky flavor but not much. mouthfeel is a little thin, but sufficient. Drinkability is quite high. A smooth drink. a good one from rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,Squaretooth,4.5,"Smells of rich chocolate. Tastes every bit as good. Pours rich, dark thick, with a nice tan foamy head and very nice even lacing.  I had this in a bottle as well as on tap. Either way you cant go wrong, but if you can find this on tap anywhere, that is the preferred way to go. Just an awesome beer and one I can drink over and over again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DrinkinBuddy,4.51,"Pours a complete black with brown particles and 1 1/2 finger light brown head. Smell is woody slight smokey with chocolate bitterness and hop infusion. Very complex smell. Taste has a slight smooth chocolate taste with a very nice hop bitterness that compliments it very well. Mouth feel is a little thin, but thicker than a porter, so it passes with a 4.5. Drinkability is definately a 5. I could and will definately seek this chocolate stout again. A definate ace in my book.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,IntriqKen,3.63,"While this is rated 'Outstanding"", I still prefer Chocolate stouts who come by their flavors ""naturally""...from the malts rather than the addition of flavors.  Pours a very black with a beautiful 2 finger milk chocolate colored head that leaves sticky mapping on the glass as you drain it.  Aroma is definitely chocolate...milk chocolate with carob aromas.  Taste is again definitely chocolate...powdered milk chocolate, carob, roasted to burnt malt, artificial vanilla tastes, lightly hopped for finishing.  Aftertaste is powdery and artificial vanilla.  Mouthfeel is too thin for what tries to come across in the flavor. Good chocolate stout, but still artificial and disappointing to me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bunnyhustle,4.32,"Poured from bomber into chalice and as soon as I opened it I could smell the chocolate. This is a black beer with a thick, mocha colored head, good retention and some lacing. Smell is of chocolate as expected but I was suprised to get a whiff of hops too. The hops are more pronounced when the beer is colder, as it warms the chocolate becomes dominant. Taste is of chocolate as well but a nice, rich, creamy chocolate, almost like a syrup. Some toasted grains and a tiny bit of hops (again, while its colder). Low carbonation and a thick, creamy mouthfeel. A pleasant, somewhat oily chocolate aftertaste left behind. Lower ABV makes this pretty drinkable. Overall a great beer and the best example of chocolate in beer I have tasted yet. As I review this is has a solid spot in the top 100, while I dont know if it will climb much higher, I certainly dont see it falling off the list. A true classic.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Very cool.  T: Chocolately, roasted barley flavor with a nicely subdued hop bitterness in the background.  M: Creamy and thick, with the roasted barley aftertaste dominating.  D: An excellent stout. Maybe not quite as good as the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, but a close second. Well done.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BeerBelcher,3.06,"I was not greatly impressed with this beer. It certainly looked the part of a sweet stout, but the flavor and mouthfeel were very reminiscent of Yoohoo chocolate drink to me...which is to say chocolate-y (in a way) yet a bit thin and watery.  This beer certainly looks the part of a top-notch stout; it was black and opaque, although not particularly viscous. Head formation was creamy and sturdy. Aroma was chocolate-y and coffee-ish, but not overpowering. Flavor was as I said, very reminiscent of Yoohoo. Mouthfeel was a bit thin.  Id weakly recommend this beer.  I picked up this 22oz bottle from Garys Liquor in Oak Creek, WI.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Floydster,3.91,"22 ounce bottle purchased from Beverages and More in Newport Beach for five dollars, last one on the shelf  Aged six months from intial purchase, probably close to a year old, second time trying this particular beer  Poured into my Aventinus glass with a very nice black color and a monsterous tan head that was close to two inches, left lacing for up to an hour, took close to two hours to finish this because it was my last beer of the night  Smell was chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate, also some coffee and roasted malt  Taste was also dominated by chocolate, there was some hoppiness left which was odd because of the age of the bottle, it gave the beer a slightly dry finish, this one must be even hoppier fresh but I cannot quite remember the first time I drank it because it was so long ago, hints of coffee came out once the beer got even warmer but it was pretty much served at room temperature, rich and filling, I am not a big chocolate fan or sweet beers in this way but I thoroughly enjoyed this, would have again  Not much carbonation at all, but the body sure was thick and full, nice long lasting mouthfeel  Could not drink much more than a bomber of this, too heavy on the stomach, the ABV is low though, does not go down easy, most definitely a sipper and dessert beer  Another nice beer from Rogue, I liked this one better than Shakespeare and their other stouts, highly recommended, glad this one is widely available",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,boogles,3,"I did not enjoy this beer. Purchased in bomber form, the beer poured nicely, but my hopes began to wane when I sniffed it. Too much chocolate. The chocolate nose reminded me of chocolate syrup for lattes, which is never as good as Hershey's syrup--which isn't very good. The taste was more offensive--like someone dumped a bunch of flavoring into what could have been a good beer. Well, someone did. Although I did not like the strength of the chocolate, it was the synthetic characteristic that I couldn't get past.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smell is overwhelmingly chocolate, believe it or not. Very sweet smelling. Taste is a sensation of chocolates. I first noticed very sweet chocolate, like Hersey. Then it was more semi-sweet. There were also notes of very bitter chocolate, almost like coffee, like the taste of eating chocolate malt. Very complex. Very delicious. I could easily kick back and enjoy these all night.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Beer pours like chocolate syrup, a completely opaque, deep dark chocolate color almost like the bottle, with a large dense head.  S: Mighty roasted coffee aroma, with sweet chocolate undertones. Some hops are noticeable as well.  T: Bitterness of dark chocolate dominates the taste, coffee becomes the undertone. Also some fruit and hoppy notes!  M: Mouthfeel is heavy and syrupy. The first few gulps combine the syrupy feel of the beer with the creaminess of the head which reminded me of hot chocolate, very silky and smooth.  D: Took me well over an hour to finish this bomber, and it made me quite full! Both the price-tag and the novelty keep it from being a regular in my fridge, but its fun and definitely worth picking up in the future.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Can definitely smell a lot of fragrant chocolate, caramel, and almost the smell of milk. The taste is really creamy, milky, and actually a bit like an oatmeal stout at first. Then it fades away into a sweeter chocolate taste that slowly turns into the aftertaste of deep dark chocolate and coffee with a lot of the bitter cocoa taste. Not too much carbonation with the beer but I think that it fits the creamy smooth nature of the beer though pretty well. A really drinkable beer too because the taste is just great and you don't get tired of the chocolate taste at all since it is not a sickingly sweet chocolate taste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Taste is malted milk, more coffee, dark chocolate almonds, chocolate cheesecake ... very, very tasty. The mouthfeel is smooth, just enough richness to make it irresistable with a medium body. I found this had a mildly bitter finish with a lingering choco-nutty aftertaste, what a treat, thanks Jan.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The first time I had this one I was knocked back of how great it taste and blended the two main items(chocolate and beer) together.  The chocolate is rich and smooth, dark chocolate.  It pours a very dark liquid and head retention is foamy.  In ranking with other beers like this one, this one is my favorite. I haven't been a big buyer of Rogue's beers but I have heard that they are pretty good.  Good example of it's kind",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

I thought I got a slight smell of hops on one wiff but it was never there again. The mystery of beer.  T: They call it a chocolate stout for a reason. Not overly sweet however which is nice. I really can't pick something else out that balances it though.  M: Wonderful silky feel to this one. Tons of tiny bubbles ease this one down nicely.  D: Splitting a 22oz bottle of this is perfect. Not too much of a good thing. Perfect desert beer. Had an 07 vertical with dinner (bufalo burgers) then this for desert and it was perfect.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BWH3,4.15,"Chocolate Stout Rogue Brewery 22 oz bottle served in Goblet at 50 F  The beer stats as presented as only Rogue does.  Northwest Harrington and Klages malt, Crystal 135-165, Beeston Chocolate Malt, Cascade Hops, Rolled oats, Roasted Barley, Natural Chocolate Flavoring, Free range coastal waters, and Pacman Yeast. Plato 15, IBU 69, 135.45 Lovibond, and 77 AA.  Appearance: Still espresso brown beverage with only a glancing hint of red in the underbelly if you hold the glass to light. Head pours a milk chocolate brown. Initially large the head fades too quickly for stout into a thin sheet of foam. The beer does cling to the glass nicely when swirled but not with the viscosity of an Imperial stout. (4.0)  Smell: The aroma is fantastic. The bouquet begins with the obvious scent of dark chocolate and roasted grain bitterness. The caramel/honey like sweetness lies beneath and is punctuated with clove, cinnamon, and vanilla notes. Overall well balanced. I would have liked the scents other than chocolate and roast grain to be bolder. (4.5)  Taste: The smell and taste are quite different. The taste is not nearly as balanced and is rather bitter. The chocolate, roast grain, and coffee flavors predominate. The rolled oats create a creamy smoothness to the flavor. Ends with solid bitterness of the roast grain that mimics the aftertaste of espresso. Overall rich and full flavored but not as dynamic as I anticipated from the aroma. In the end, I prefer other stouts to this one in terms of taste. (3.5)  Mouthfeel: Superb. Rich full bodied without being syrup like. The oats give a nice smooth slick finish and explain the beers legs when swirled. The carbonation is perfect as well. (5.0)  Drinkablility: I enjoyed this one. I could easily drink another. Certainly worth trying and comparing to other widely available craft brewed stouts. (4.5)",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smell is of rich milk chocolate with the slightest hint of spicy hops. Taste is decent but a little too sweet for me. I do enjoy beers with chocolate taste but this one seems to go in the wrong direction for me. Mouthfeel is about medium and silky with a hop bite in the finish.

Some hops, little bitter, though a dry bitter. Not hops aroma which is desirable. Malt almost tastes porterish.  M - Sits well. Above aveage, tantilizing beer molecules. Aftertaste sour bitter very enjoyable. Not thick at all.  D - Id love to have one of these frequently. Pricetag isnt horrible at $6US per bomber.  Overall a very very nice beer.

There's a quick rise to a head of about 1 inch, which scales down to medium lace around the glass. Pitch black. Smells like sweet chocolates, and when inhaled a tick layer of hop aroma. The hops are there but not overpowering - well balanced behind the malt and chocolate.. my GF loved it, and she's not a fan of high hop beers.

No hints of alcohol and little hop. Perfect balance of the roasted malts and cocoa. Feels thin, as it warms up it coats the tounge and lets the chocolate really sink in. This is very good.

Smell- Sweet coffee & cacao, with plenty of chocolate. slightly biscuity. Smells like dessert.  Taste-Rich chocolaty taste with hints of biscuit and toffee tones. If there were such a thing as a beer milkshake, this would be it, only with beer. This beer is fabulous. The chocolate is everywhere on my palate. It is a superbly balanced beer.

I was told by a bartender to try it combined with a Rogue Chipotle Ale to make a mole black and tan, which was phenominal.

Unfortunately the overpowering taste is the burnt coffee. Burnt is the correct word too because the taste is more than just roasted coffee. If the burnt flavor is toned down this could be a good beer.  M- Good mouthfeel, little light for my taste but is still a medium body.  D- This wasn't an enjoyable beer.

T: Bitter up front, gives off a very espresso like flavor, the chocolate is there as well, with some hop to follow.  M: Thin, very carbonated, mildly creamy.

A touch of roasty malt and just a bit of hops at the finish to give a nice, slightly bitter and dry finish. The best chocolate flavored beer I have ever had.

Smell presented with hints of espresso and malt. As soon as the beer touched the front of my tongue, flavors of dark chocolate and roasted/burnt coffee wafted through my sinuses; however, the smell was much more intense than the flavor.

Chocolate sweetness stays though the end. It's like drinking a candy bar!  M: Medium-light bodied - a little more body would have been nice. Carbonation perfect. Very slight astringency, which is to be expected. Pretty good in this respect.

Not really able to detect anything else, but that's okay. I love chocolate! Taste is also as expected heavy on the chocolate flavor, almost like they added chocolate syrup or copious amounts of cocoa to the beer. The cocoa flavor is very nice, gives it a kind of bakers chocolate flavor, without any noticeable roasted coffee flavors. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, possibly due to the oats used in the recipe, possibly due in part to Rogue's proprietary yeast. Whatever the cause, it is quite enjoyable. Drinkability is extremely high, unless you are just against chocolate flavor. Try it with ice cream as a float. It's delicious. Also, i've had the chance to try it on nitro before this, and i must say i prefer it from the bottle. Easily my new favorite beer!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Not very complex, but right now i dont care as the balance of this beer to the style is solid. A joke that its ranked top 50 beers in the world, but there are a lot of beers that are very wrongly classified. Whats important is that this is a well done beer and nothing to be scoffed at.

Head rises up an inch and a half and slowly settles to but a skim coat. Aroma is much chocolate - wish I could say I get some hops but the chocolate is there by itself - slightly sweet.  Tasting this one is very nice. Lots of chocolate hits the tongue with a roll of carbonation that imbeds the chocolate into your tongue until a wave of hops digs it out and dries your tongue out in the process. Great flavor, balance and well taste...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,biggmike,4.23,"Poured an attractive black color with brown head that lingered. Aroma is chocolate, but also of Cascade hops. Flavor is very chocolatey, but the sweetness is balanced well by by the hops. This was very tasty. Nice lacing on glass. If you like chocolate, do yourself a favor and try this. If you dont like chocolate this might convert you.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,Strix,4.15,"22 oz. bottle.  Nearly black with a chocolate-colored head. Smells of roasted malts with a hint of chocolate. Chocolate is present in the initial taste, then fades to a roasted malt and hazelnut. Long lingering aftertaste is slightly bitter, reminiscent of dark chocolate. Very smooth mouthfeel. Very nicely done.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,HopsHops,4.88,WHOA!!!  CHOCOLATE STOUT  This is absolutely outstanding... I didnt know chocolate stout could actually taste so much like actual chocolate.  Pair this with some chocolate ice cream. I dare ya!!! Thats what i have done and i am astounded.  Smell was a bit faint but the rich chocolate flavor and the drinkablity wow ...mouth feel was just right as well...Nice dark rich color I should have got 2 of these...  Excellent work....,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,stcules,3.95,"Almost black, some dark brown edges. A finger of a compact beige head. In the smell: chocolate, strong, and vanilla. Definitely soft, smooth and pleasant. Under that, some toasted malt, fruit, but the chocolate is dominant. In the smell some more bitterness, but still it is very smooth, with a dominant note of chocolate, and oat for the softness. Balanced. Vanilla. Quite light in body. Chocolate, hazelnut in the aftertaste. And a very long bitterness.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,marksto,4.37,"Pours jet black with a tan, rocky head that displays good retention. Aroma is dominated by cocoa, vanilla, and coffee; with some malt sweetness and light fruity esters. Flavor is a delicious blend of smooth roasty malt flavors balanced really nicely with a chocolate, toffee-like character. A bit like a cross of really smooth stout with the character and mouthfeel of a frothy milkshake.  An excellent example of an american stout, one of the better offerings from an excellent Oregon micro, highly recommend.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,sloejams,4.68,"This has long been one of my alltime favorites stouts. It's a breakfast beer. It's a dessert beer. It's chocolate. It's stout. It's fucking delicious.  I always use a chalice for this fine beer. It's beautiful - deep dark coffee color with a nice frothy cappuccino head, lace cascading throughout as I roll the glass about. The initial aroma is bittersweat chocolate followed by flavors of toast and roasted malt. The chocolate is in the forefront of taste too. What is truly remarkable about the taste is the high hop content. Hops are certainly not something that comes to mind when you think about a stout, no less a chocolate stout. Somehow the fine brewers of Rogue make this effortless and most importantly - truly delicious.  A phenomenal beer for any time.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,lackenhauser,3.88,"Very nice, deep cocoa coloredbeer with a good sized, tan head on top. Moderate aroma-mix of roasted malt balanced against a slight chocolate tinge. Good malty flavor-the chocolate stands out just enough to be noticed. Decent amount of roasted and choclate malt flavor as well. Nice mouthfeel-somewhat drying and ever so slightly astringent. A very enjoyable beer. Much more drinkable then some of the other flavored beers out there.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,allengarvin,4.25,"An oversight, me never getting around to reviewing this beer. It pours a jet-black color with a big, smooth, and creamy head of foam. Nose is excellent, full of notes of dark, semibitter chocolate, lightly roasted, rich and appetizing... this is how my ideal hot chocolate smells on a cold wintry night. Taste is superbly chocolatey, though bordering on the too-sweet, balanced by moderately low hoppiness and a medium malt roast. Bittersweet finish.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,brewmaster411,3.74,"This beer is black in color with a dark tan head. The initial aroma is roast, giving way to a subtle chocolate aroma. The roast dominates the aroma. The flavor again is dominated with the roast. The hop aroma and flavor are subdued and hidden by the roast. I can barely perceive any chocolate flavor.  I prefer to have a balance of flavors in my beers. While a very good, and well crafted stout, I could barely perceive chocolate flavors and aromas.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

It's odd in a good way. You get a immediate bitter burnt taste followed by chocolate all the way through.  Mouthfeel: A touch thin compared to what the smell/taste would lead you to believe  Drinkability: Although this is good it has a thick taste to it enspite of the feel you get while drinking it. May be a bit hard to finish off more than 1 of these",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mshallah,4.47,Pours inky black with a brown head. Smells of milk chocolate and chocolate milk. Slight lime citrus aroma. Strong milk chocolate and chocolate milk flavors. Just yummy. Hops impart a slight citrus acidity. Body is very smooth and thick. Oats evident in the mouthfeel. Not creamy but smooth and full. What an amazing sipper. Coffee tones build to add to an astringent finish. Milk chocolate flavors and aromas dominate to make a wonderful beer. Can't wait to purchase more and pair with chocolate and vanilla desserts.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,baggio,4.19,"Bottle at Monks Cafe!  A: Dark brown with a thin lightbrown lace.  S: Milk chocolate all over the place.  T: Chocolate, liqorice, dark bread.  M: Silky smooth with medium carbonation and medium sized bubbles.  Fantastic brew. It reminds me of Youngs double chocolate stout but with a more complex and fuller body. Recommended!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,udubdawg,4.17,"22 oz bomber  Pours a very dark brown, though not particularly thick, with a very large light brown head. Retention is impressive, and even picking up and putting down the glass is enough motion to bring up more brown foam. Lacing is limited, but I find there is nothing to complain about here. Really nice.  Hey, I think there's a little chocolate here. Intoxicating, rich and sweet hot cocoa aroma. I can't say that it smells like anything I'd call beer, but I love it nevertheless. Fantastic.  Although I love the aroma, I find myself glad that it doesn't taste like it smells - something this sweet and chocolatey would be better suited to one of my wife's sickly sweet nightcaps. Instead I find I am enjoying a beverage full of dark roasted malt, a decent amount of residual sweetness, balancing hoppy bitterness, and not sticky-sweet at all. Part of me wants to side with the un-flavored stouts I love, but I find I cannot judge this great effort harshly.  For all that is there the beer is surprisingly thin. I'd like to see a bit more, but only if the sweetness is kept restrained. Caronation is medium and works well with the thinner body. Drinkability is limited only by my enjoyment of the style; I imagine some women I've known would guzzle this stuff.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jfrank85,4.26,"Pour was decent with minimal head and very little lacing. Color was dark, not black, more dark brown. Smell was wonderful, chocolate malts that almost smelled smoked come to mind. Taste was also great with a strong emphasis on blending the chocolate and beer taste to its best potiental. I could definatly drink one of these on a hot day or even as a desert after diner.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mnj21655,4.42,"22 oz. bomber poured into a pint glass.  Pours a deep, dark brown, nearly black in color with a finger and a half of dark tan head that leaves lots of sticky lacing. Wonderful aroma. The smell is dominated by a wonderful chocolate, some bitterness, a nice malty sweetness and hints of hops. Taste is wonderful and incredibly complex. Wonderful chocolatey and roasted notes dominate. At first you are hit with a chocolate flavor and some associated bitterness that melds with oats, roasted barley and chocolate malts. The chocolate flavor dissipates slightly and lets malts and roasted barley take control until the finish. In the finish the chocolate flavor comes back with a vengeance and remains long after the beer is gone. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nice, medium-ish body with carbonation that is just shy of moderate. Drinkability is great. The amazingly complex taste and wonderful aroma make this a pleasure to drink. If you haven't had this be sure to give it a try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,scott,4.67,"V.07  Rich & luxurious mouth of burnt malt, chocolate, smoke & peat. Nose is a robust equivolent, just begging for consumption. Minimally carbonated after an initial fluffy head. Mildly bitter finish. I was in the mood for a nice big stout (and I'm rewarded with it also having a low abv), and this surly delivered. A satisfying beverage that comes highly recommended. Way too easy to drink.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,younger35,4.53,"Drank from a good ol pint glass. Have had this beer in the cellar fridge for quite some time and figured it would be a nice beer to drink after Stones VE 07.  Appearance- Pours jet ass black with a huge light brown frothy head. Leaves a nice layer of head on top that leaves fairly minimal lacing down the glass. Looks like it could be dessert. Smell- Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate. A very sweet cocoa nose that really took me aback. I thought the chocolate part of Chocolate Stout referred to the malts used, not actually chocolate. After further investigation there is still a slight fruitiness to the nose. Taste- Well, like a broken record Chocolate. Starts with a big burst of chocolate that recedes, yet never really leaves the palate. Luscious dark fruits add a bit of bitterness that helps to cut into the sweetness of the brew. The alcohol is slightly detectable. Finishes with a coffee/espresso like aftertaste that lingers for quite a long time. Mouthfeel- Silky smooth! Its like a chocolate beer shake. Light carbonation mixes well with the thin body of the beer. Drinkability- IMO opinion this beer would be best enjoyed with some kind of non-chocolate dessert or after a big ol hop bomb. Its super delicious and the only thing that stops me from giving it a five is the fact that the sweetness lingers in the mouth for quite some time. The 22oz bomber is almost too much for one sitting but youll definitely enjoy it. Yet another super high quality beer from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,meechum,4.8,A - Pours dark black into a pint mug with huge head and extreme lacing after the head goes down  S - Chocolate which is huge up front and then if you move past that you can smell some woods and burnt toasts and roasted malts  T/M - Very luxuriant mouth with a touch of carbonation at just the right level. The taste is as advertised it starts out with a huge chocolate flavor and then moves to some of the malted flavors and then finishes with just a touch of hoppy bitterness to even out the flavor  D - This was a wonderful brew. I would personally caution that because of it's sweetness that one 22 oz bottle in a session should be plenty. This in my opinion could be served as a desert in itself. I would keep some on hand for a relaxing night cap,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Brad007,4.65,"Pours a deep black color with a nice brown head. The ingredient list seems similar to Shakespeare Stout. We'll see though. Aroma is very creamy with chocolate essence up front. Almost like a frothy milkshake-type of aroma. Taste is much of the same. Very creamy and chocolatey up front. The taste fades into a smooth, coffee-like aftertaste. Very nice beer that would go well with a chocolate dessert. It's not too overpowering and the creaminess really compliments it. Similar in scope to Shakespeare Stout but with more creaminess and some chocolate essence. Still very good! I'd go as far as to rate it slightly above the Shakespeare.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mdm46410,4.07,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a shaker. This stout poured an opaque black with a huge, rocky, tan head that slowly faded away. Some creamy lacing was left around the glass. The aroma of this stout was made up of rich chocolate, light spicy hop notes, and some roasted malt. The flavor was dominated by the chocolate. Some excellent roastiness also arrived towards the end, then finished with a mild lasting bitterness. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. A very nice stout. Highly recommended for chocolate lovers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,rgdgerard,4,"Poured very black with a big head that subsided over time. Retention was not impressive.  Nose: Roasted chocolate, milder than I would have thought from reading other reviews, and faintly alcoholic. Slight coffee bean aroma.  Slick smooth mouth feel- not chewy. A lot lighter than I would have thought for a stout. Malts predominate along with a mild chocolate, which could have been more pronounced. Moderate carbonation. Slight bitterness of hops emerges more as the brew warms.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mhaugan,4.25,"Tasted at the Tempe Great Arizona Beer Festival  I had previously stayed away from chocolate stouts. Not sure why. The color was very dark black with a nice thick head. Smell is chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate. Taste is creamy chocolate with just a hint of bitterness and alcohol. Mouthfeeel was almost slightly grainy. This might have been a function of the tasting environment. I can't wait to try this with a nice slice of plain cheesecake. Will pick up a bottle to have the next time cheesecake is on the menu.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,beerphan,4.5,"22oz brown bomber -&gt; imperial pint no date  Pours black with a huge tight thick, more brown than tan, head that seems to be depositing chunks of brown lace down the glass. Appears to be well carbonated as bubbles climb the side of the glass after each sip.  Nose: Roasted chocolate, faint wisp of alcohol, sweet candy like dark fruits, toasted molasses, coffee beans. Citrus from hops emerges as the brew breathes.  Slick creamy delicious mouth. Not quite chewy but definitely thick. Malts dominate along with a silky chocolate. Bittersweet bitterness leaves a slightly chalky feel in the mouth, and barely balances the thick sweetness.  A great brew that stands up to its moniker and reputation.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Damian,4.84,"Drank on-tap at Redbones Barbecue, Somerville, MA  Poured an opaque brown/black with a one-finger, cocoa-colored, creamy head that slowly faded to a thick ring. Tiny droplets of lacing clung to the sides of the glass and lasted through most of the drink.  The aroma was pure hot fudge from beginning to end. I tried looking for indications of other aromas but soon discovered this was futile.  The taste was a terrificly balanced blend of sweet and bitter flavors. The beer started malty rich, chocolatey (sweet, dark chocolate) and creamy up front with hints of vanilla. Deep, roasted malts and black coffee came through mid-palate. The long-lasting finish was surprising hoppy, espresso-like and quite dry with a rich, chocolatey aftertaste.  The mouthfeel was thick, creamy and silky smooth with a fine, moderate carbonation that brought out the best of the flavors.  Despite its overall lack of complexity, this was an outstanding beer. I sampled it both on-tap and in a bottle and I found the tap version to be richer, smoother, more chocolatey and, overall, far superior. It could pair perfectly with a variety of chocolate desserts but I would recommend savoring it on its own.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

I can also taste a coffee flavor as well.  Mouthfeel- A very smooth medium body beer.  Drinkability- This beer is fantastic! It would be awesome to drink in the winter time.

132,1118,TheBierBand,4.45,"Again, my wife, Sandy purchased this for me... no special occasion.... just because she's GREAT!  Poured from the 22 oz bomber into my pint glass to produce a thick, creamy tan head of about 2"". The beer is a nice ebony color and TOTALLY opaque when held to light.  The head settled down to 1/4"" and stayed to the bottom of the glass leaving thick clumps of lacing.  The aroma is wonderful... heavy on chocolate sweetness and a bit of roasted malt.  The taste: Very nice! The roasted malt and dark chocolate dominate early and then just a touch of bitterness follows. A very nicely balanced stout that I will have again and again.  Mouthfeel: Nice aftertaste and mouth coating. Carbonation is about right.  Drinkability: Highly recommended. 22 oz bomber was quaffed readily without any ill-effects. PROST!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,McStagger,4.35,"Keep hearing good things bout this one....  A: Pours a beautiful black with brownish tan head. Head is consistent in texture with freshly whipped cream.  S: Present yet subtle dark chocolate. Espresso and cream. This beer smells incredible.  T: Malt, cream and dark chocolate. Dark chocolate lingers across the palate for ten seconds or more after swallowing. The finish further evolves into cappuccino and dark mocha. Chocolate definitely dominates the palate, and it is exquisite.  M: Smooth as silk. This beer slides across the palate, leaving cloying pockets of flavor throughout.  D: The only downfall of this beer. Beer is chocolate deliciousness. However, it's a dark chocolate flavor and as such, is hard to enjoy in a large quantity.  Hands down, one of the best stouts I've ever tasted. The chocolate is present and powerful, but not overly so.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,bigman147,4.3,Appearance: Pours opaque black and thick. Head is dark nutty brown. It is thick but settles fairly quick with nice lacing and a whispy veil.  Aroma: Smells like milk chocolate. Slight herbal note. Mostly chocolate and coffee notes.  Taste: Malty sweet but not overpowering. The chocolate is definitely the prevailing smell/taste/everything to this beer. A nice peppery spicy note from the hops refreshes and reminds you that its beer not some chocolate elixir. It makes me wonder if they achieve this through adding chocolate or perfectly balancing malts. There is a slight astringency that makes me feel they use Black malt in the grain bill. Overall its a killer taste  Mouthfeel: Carbonation seemed to be too high and forced I would love to see this on cask or nitro. Drying finish with the dark malts left an odd lingering characteristic.  Drinkability: This is very tasty and very drinkable. It won't be an everyday beer for most just based on the chocolaty taste. I wouldn't recommends it with desserts but I would recommend it as dessert or used in the dessert. I tried pairing this with some ice cream and found that with sweet things it loses its own sweetness and becomes far too bitter.  Perfect Recipe with any left over (if thats possible): Reduce in a pan by 3/4's. Add 1-2 tbsp of sugar (brown or white). Add 2 cups fresh cherries. Cook for 10-15 minutes until sauce picks up a pinkisk cherry hue. Serve over good vanilla ice cream. I made this the other day and my wife and friends loved it. They couldn't believe how strong the chocolate from the beer became.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Some roasted notes and a little bitterness for balance.  Mouthfeel: Somewhat light, not too heavy.  Drinkability: A nice change-of-pace or dessert beer, not really session material.

Smell is mostly of the chocolate malt, but there is a slight hint of the cascade. The initial taste is quite hoppy, but it is also quite chocolaty and malty which results in a well balanced beer. There is a slight chocolate-hop residual taste. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a full, creamy carbonation.

There was Stone, Ithaca and Rogue representing the brewing world. I have to say, this was my favourite of the night. The woman representing Rogue is the same one whose visage graces the bottle and she was very nice. I got one to go so here is the review.  A-Pours an opague black with a thick soapy five plus fingered head. Really gorgeous to behold.  S-a baked chocolate smell, very dry as well. What I think are cascade hops form the finish to the smell. This particularly comes out as it warms.  T-a lovely roasted malt combines with the chocolate to form one tasty start. The roasted bitterness also perfectly forms with the nice hoppy aftertaste to form one dry finish. This is such a well rounded beer it is amazing. The hops are what really push this to the next level. They provide a wonderful dry quality to mesh well with the malt. Not as sweet as I would think either.  M-Slightly chewy with a low level of carbonation well done for the style.  D-This is superb. I had a few of these tonight and paired one with Ciao Bello's Lebanese Yogurt Gelato to form one hell of an oce cream float. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys this beer. vanilla or coffee would do well to but the slighhtly tart yogurt really went well with this.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kevinglin,4,"22 oz. bottle poured into pint glass - black in color with a persistent, tan head. Didn't notice any other tones or colors - very dark overall.  Chocolate aroma hits you up front and the taste follows suit and comes across as quite sweet. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick, but lively carbonation keeps it from being chewy.  Very drinkable, but in moderation. Sweetness of the chocolate does not make this a session beer, but it is good as a nightcap or dessert beer - mix it with a fruit-beer or lambic for a sweet treat.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The stout poured very thick with about one finger's worth of head and an aroma that was ever so soothing to my sniffer. The chocolate flavor in this brew was excellent! I enjoyed every sip of it as the night continued to wind down. If anyone enjoys a good smooth cigar with a great beer, Rogue's Chocolate Stout might just be the perfect pair. I will most definitely enjoy this beer again and again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

T: Boy does the Chocolate stand front and center here, at this point I am begging for the marshmellows. So much chocolate with a great background of malt and a hint of hop.  M: It is pretty heavy, average body for a stout.  D: It goes down as good as it tastes. Due to the overpowering chocolate one pint or bomber is enough for me.  Overall its another good beer by Rogue. I love how they have brought the chocolate into the foreground in this brew while muting the coffee. The coffee is there, but the chocolate is the real star here. This would be a good beer to lay on someone who is wanting to come over to the dark side. It is not too overpowering, and has they nice warming chocolatelyness that will win their heart over.

Smell is dominated by a sweet, dark chocolate. Hints of toasted grain, too. Tastes of the chocolate, too. Little bit of bitterness, like dark chocolate or roasted coffee. Good balance between the sweet and bitter of the tastes. Medium mouthfeel - perfect for this type of stout, although I wouldn't mind it being thicker. Overall, a wonderfully drinkable stout. Nice use of the chocolate without being too one-dimensional. Another strong offering from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Good retention, followed by nice, sticky lacing coating the sides of the glass. The aroma is, well, chocolate. Milk chocolate for starters, powdered cocoa, then the sweetness of it leaves way to a more subdued, coffe/tofee like- aroma, and at points even some earth-like smells. This beer is quite firm on the palate, interestignly starting somewhat bitter, even lightly hopped, followed coffee and earthy flavors, and then obviously layers and layers of chocolate. Sweetish throughout most of it, but not cloying, and the aftertaste is like bittersweet chocolate. Big, bold, but not overpowering or cloying, this one went down amazingly easy with chocolate truffles. Indeed a masterpiece; great dessert beer with chocolates or on its own.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TechMyst,4.6,"From bomber to becker at cold temp. Color is opaque black with light brown head, quite a bit actually. Transmitted color is deep ruby. Decent amount of lacing.

Good amout of bittering balancing the sweet. Not really a sipper, but not something you'd want to slam either; drinkability is excellent. A little heavy on the belly, but it's a chocolate stout, so that's understandable. Great quality; nothing fake or cloying here. Definitely would try again! Not a lot going on with this, but still interesting. Could be considered a good baseline/benchmark for the style.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mwearl,4.58,"Poured from a 22oz bottle, this beer was black with a tall brown frothy head with lacing that never quit. Ample smell of dark chocolate and sweetness. Taste was mildly smoky with lots of dark cacao chocolate with a little bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium with no special characteristics to note. Very drinkable beer even for a stout. I've had other chocolate stouts and the Rogue should be the benchmark to compare all others in my opinion.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,PittBeerGirl,3.78,A- wonderful. small creamy dark tan head with deep black body.  S- sweet dark chocolate and coffee. some hops noted too.  T- malty at the beginning with hints of coffee. bitter hop aftertaste. Dark chocolate lingers. The chocolate and hops blend well together.  M- thick heavy body and high carbonation. Goes down pretty easy.  D- This is a very drinkable treat. Its not hard to drink the whole bomber in one sitting and that is enough for the time being too.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,genog,3.88,"Poured a brownish black that left little head  Strong, rich, dark chocolate smell  Taste is a burnt coffee aroma, with dark chocolate and some dried fruit taste.  The mouthfeel is what I really like as it punches the back of my cheeks and found that really nice combination with the rich flavors.  I would drink this again. I had this with a buddy, and we quickly finished the bottle, and were disappointed when it was gone.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

This is very tasty brew  M- creamy, almost with an extra stout consistancy. very nice  D- one of the easiest drinking stouts out there. A perfect dessert beer that can be drunki often. Nothing out of whack, nothing out of control. Just balanced goodness and one of my favorites.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

T- Sweet, but not as sweet as the smell advertised. All around a balanced beer, strng chocolate taste present.  M- Smooth, creamy, not too thick.  D- A bit too sweet, chocolaty for my tastes.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BretSikkink,4.4,"Review from notes. On tap at the Crescent Moon in Omaha.  Inky black, viscous liquid, dark tan head. Good retention pretty sweet lacing as well.  Baker's chocolate in the malt; a little sweet and a little bitter, but not overly roasted. I noted a little sting of alcohol in the nose as well.  The flavor is very balanced, sweet malt with a good earthy hop presence. Mostly coffee and chocolate flavors, with some dark fruit as well.  Full mouthfeel, good carbonation keeps things light but properly thick. A little bitter afterflavor, nothing to draw away from the admirable qualities of this sweet stout. Dry finish.  Very natural sort of chocolate flavor that runs throughout. This is an amazing stout, a one-off Shakespeare that does it right: no fake choco syrup or additives. Awesome brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ArrogantB,3.53,This beer was dark black as stouts usually are. The head was a light coffee color. The smell was just a hint of dark chocolate. The taste was also dark chocolate but not very strong. i was actually expecting a stronger flavor since flavoring was added. This beer was decent and probably one of the better Rogue beers I have had.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Mickelswit,4.38,"The bottle smelled immediately like chocolate upon opening. It was like unwrapping a bar of dark chocolate. The beer poured thick and black, forming a lingering brown head. No light made it through the glass.  The beer smelled of chocolate, but not in a sickly sweet or overpowering way. There was still that soft roasty note that stouts have. Chocolate is, of course, the main taste in the beer, but the roasty notes and just a bit of soft hops show through in the finish, which is crisp. The whole bomber went down nice and silky.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Onibubba,4,"Black pour with a short mocha brown head. Agood swirl brings it back up and releases the aroma. Intense bittersweet chocolate and malted milk. Smells really delicious. Interesting...The taste is not as overly sweet as the smell would lead you to believe. Reminds me of more of a milk chocolate than a bitter darker one. There are some welcome bitter notes on the finish though. Mouthfeel is good, very smooth. Carbonation does not make itself too noticeable. Very drinkable. The alcohol is low enough that it is a non issue. Delicious and filling beer. Very solid.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jdaelhousen,4.29,"Thick pour, but has an elegant formation for 1 inch of head.  Smelled of extremely sweet chocolate malts and nutty aroma.  Upon first taste, the chocolate sensation is immediately present, but a woody flavoring hits the palatte right before consumption of the sip.  The aftertaste contains a sweet and pleasant blend of the woody flavor and the dominant chocolate notes.  The mouthfeel of this stout is very thick and syrupy while the balanced alcohol % is noticeable... Overall, a fine choice for an after-dinner beverage and high on my list of chocolate stouts.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Mebuzzard,4.62,"OK, I've had this before in bottle and on tap. Decided to review the bottle, which meant I had to drink it again. Darn the luck... Pours a rich, smooth black body topped by a thick and rick dark tan head. Nice retention and lacing. Smells very very nice. Coffee and chocolate blen well here, along with dark fruit, anise and some prune. Tastes wonderful. the balance between the chocolate and coffee is outstanding. Like having a chocolate coffee. Black fruits round out the palate to give a hint of sweetness other than the chocolate. Good subtle bite on the end takes care of any residue or lingering aftertastes that may be unpleasant. Great beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,wagenvolks,4.37,"Bomber into a tulip glass.  A sandy, taupe-colored head appears thick and leaves little lacing, but is well retained. Body is a deep, seal brown and impermeable to light. Lots going on in the aroma department: gingerbread, cinnamon, sugar, dough, chocolate, toffee, and a dash of spice & fruit.  Taste isn't as flavorful as the aroma'd suggest: some bready malt notes with chocolate and mocha coffee. A spritzy mouthfeel for a stout, a bit thin, but with good carbonation levels. It falls a bit flat after about ten minutes, but the taste gets better as it warms. A bitter, semi-sweet chocolate aftertaste finishes the flavor. Basically, the aroma on this beer hooked me. Everything else is good, like most Rogues. Definately one I'll be having again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,andebrice,4.62,"Pours a dark black, with a tan two finger head that didn't stick around very long. Good color for the style. Smells of sweet chocolates with hints of vanilla and caramel. Very Very sweet smell. This smells really good cold, I will have to let this warm up a bit and then smell it too. I would have to rate this as one the best smelling ,for the style, that I have ever smelled. Doesn't seem to taste as sweet as I would have expected. Has a nice dark, very bitter chocolate fell through most of the drink, finishes with a burnt toast or kind of an oatmeal stout character, with just a hint of vanilla. This is a very full brew with minimal carbonation, perfect for the style. I may just add this to my regular drinking list. I should also note that if beers were rated on smellability this would rate a 5. I could smell this brew all day long.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jmalex,4.43,"This is a long time favorite of mine. I was even lucky enough to have Chocolate Stout served to me by Sebbie herself at this past year's Philly Craft Beer Fest.  APPEARANCE: Pours black, black, black with a 2-finger loose-bubbled tan head. It lasts for a considerable amount of time looking picture perfect. Lacing is also spectacular. This beer can't possibly look any better.  SMELL: A major amalgam of smells, but the chocolate (not surprisingly) stands out the most. Bittersweet cocoa is right up front with a backing of caramel, roasted barley, and a bit of diacetyl. The chocolate aromas don't seem artificial either, like one would see (smell) in other beers. Wonderfully chocolaty!  TASTE: It starts out mildly malty and roasty with heavy flavors of Pacman. The chocolate comes on soon enough and in perfect levels of intensity. The finish is roasty with continuing chocolaty-ness and a bitterness of black malt and northwest hops. Clearly one of the best uses of chocolate in a beer that I've ever had.  MOUTHFEEL: The falling point of this beer unfortunately. Not that it's thin, but it's just not as beefy and thick and mouth-coating as I'd prefer. It's almost a bit watery despite the medium body.  DRINKABILITY: I couldn't have chosen anything better to have for dessert tonight. The sweetness of this may not be for everyone, but it's certainly for me.  Thank you Rogue and thank you Sebbie for giving us this wonderful brew that I'll be going back to again and again. This brew proves that beer and chocolate are a combination that works together fantastically.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,SaltyLime,4.42,"Great for a desert, would drink this as a reward to self.  Appearance - BLACK! Did not lighten up a bit when held up to the light. Nice dark tan head.  Smell - Dark chocolate, malty. Gentle but solid aromas.  Taste - Yummy. A little softer carbonation & lightening up on the hop bitterness would have made this perfect. Definitely reminded me of Hershey's dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel - Chocolate taste lated forever on the palate. I now k now why the lady on the label had a big smile. Could have been a little bit smoother.  Drinkability - Loved it, but not sure about drinking this one all night long.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RJLarse,4.25,"I bought a 650 ML bottle of Rogue Chocolate Stout at a grocery store. Poured in to a pint tumbler.  Pours an ebony black color and is opaque, with a frothy camel hair brown head. The head is quite resilient and leaves a lot of brown bubbly lace on the glass. Almost like a brownish marshmallow residue from hto chocolate.  The smell is fairly faint, not as strong as I expected anyway, and has chocolate and dairy aromas.  The taste is predictably chocolate (natural chocolate flavoring added). There is also a mellow malt flavor in the background, and then a mildly bitter finish. The flavors are well mingled and balanced. It tastes a little bit like instant hot chocolate (Swiss Miss).  Mouth feel is smooth and full bodied. Not as thick as I thought it might be.  This is a drinkable brew, but certainly not an everyday sort of thing. It would be good in the winter, maybe for a holiday gathering. I'd have it again. I'll look for it around the holidays.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,zebulon,4.15,"Had this from a 22 oz bottle.  Opened the bottle and the chocolate aroma hit me. It drank this slowly and the aroma didn't disapate. The taste had the complexity and variety that you find in good dark chocolate. I kept thinking this was a premium chocolate bar in a bottle.  The color was ebony with a tan somewhat coffee colored head that lasted and tasted creamy. The inch + head eventually went down, but each time I swished the glass it can back somewhat.  As I said the taste mirrored the aroma chocolate and bitter hops, dry on the tongue, not unpleasant, maybe a little malt not sweet, but balancing the bitterness. It had some fizziness which also mitigated the bitterness.  Concidering the bitterness it was surprisingly light on the tongue. All in all a good job of balancing.  I am not sure how to rate the drinkability. The taste stayed with me for quite a while. Not unpleasant. A drinkable chocolate bar and I like chocolate. It is just that I got satiated on this, it is not a beer that I can drink more that one of.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Easily 3 fingers of thick frothy and persistant tan head which decorates the glass with sheets of lace.  Scent is sweet chocolate and vanila and dark fruit and soft powdered cocoa.  Taste? Tart at first! I taste blackberries and cream! Followed by sweet chocolate and a lingering dark cocoa finish. Wow! This is absolutely delicious! After the very long dusty cocoa subsides I even notice a subtle citrus hop flavor and gentle bitterness.  Mouthfeel is a creamy medium-heavy.  Drinkability is very high.  I'm really impressed by this beer. Probably the best ""chocolate"" stout I've had. The tart fruity berry taste, the dramatic long finish, the way the hops sneak in at the very last moment... What a remarkable beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,GbVDave,4.1,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into two 16oz pint glasses. Thanks to HeatherAnn for the assist.  A: Deep, dark, black with a really pretty mocha colored head. Pours with the consistancy of chocolate milk.  S: Big chocolate aroma dominates. This is followed closely by hops and something I can only describe as bitter cocoa.  T: Bittersweet chocolate, bitter hops, with a bitter, bitter, bitter burnt malt finish. Also detected a fleeting hint of coffee in there.  M: I found the mouthfeel on this one to be too dry, puckery, and bitter. I expected more creaminess from a ""chocolate stout"".  D: Strange, but while I found this to be dry like a desert, I was won over by the immense chocolate and dark roasted/burnt malt flavors going on with this one. A challenging stout, indeed.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S - Bittersweet chocolate and chocolate malt aromas coplimented with sublte citrus odors that lingers with a faint hop aroma. The smell is similar to chocolate cereal.  M - Creamy tip of the tongue sweetness tantalizes. The full body and dry chocolate sweetness finishes with a slight bitterness.  T - Chocolate, the bittersweet variety similar to baking chocolate and cocoa flavors. Nutty and roasty malt with a subtle dry texture. Sweet mixes with bitter or spicy hop tinges toward the end.  D - Decent amount of chocolate in the aroma keeps you coming back. The Cocoa and bittersweet cocoa tastes are the primary flavor with a citric hop quality and a dry stout finish. It is a decent chocolate stout, but not the best chocolate ale overall.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jwc215,3.2,"650 ml bottle, ""Made with imported chocolate"" stamped on bottle.  Pours almost black with a foamy tan head that descends to a thin cover.  The smell is of sweet chocolate with some cherry notes.  The taste is of bittersweet chocolate truffle upfront. Slightly chalky. Some metallic/plastic notes. Opposite of descriptiion - start off sweeter and ends more bitter. Not too fond of the way the Cascade hops work together with the dark malt and chocolate.  The feel is a bit thinner than expected, but holds up decently. Doesn't quite coat the mouth the way I would like it to.  I love chocolate and stouts, but this one doesn't thrill me. I much prefer the Shakespeare Stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kajerm,4,"Bomber with a woman drawn in the typical Rogue style. Pours brown-black with a fluffy off-white head and gobs of lacing; the head and lacing make it look like a black IPA.  The immediate aroma is a strong cocoa note, along with some roasted malts. There is a clear Cascade hop smell that contrasts interestingly with strong sweetness of the chocolate.  The flavor profile, like the aroma, is bimodal-- lots of early overpowering sweetness and chocolate flavor which gives way to citric hop flavor and bitterness. The typical pacific northwest hop-everything-to-death approach works really well here-- the strong and slightly artificial cocoa flavor would become sickening and cloying after two sips without the hops. With them, this is one of the more interesting tasting beers I've had, and one of the first really hoppy stouts that I've liked.  My only real beef with this beer is the same one I had with Shakespeare Stout-- the mouthfeel is way too thin. I like my stouts to be chewier and more substantial, especially when they have such a strong chocolate flavor. Even looking at this as a stout/APA hybrid (which, in a way, it is), I still need more weight, and I think this can only really be delivered at 7+% ABV.  On the upside though, it's hugely drinkable-- I drank a bomber of this stuff without blinking once.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smell: CHOCOLATE, scent of sweet chocolate, vanilla and even a little coffee.  Taste: From start to finish its a refreshing taste of sweet milk chocolate and dark chocolate. This beer has the most natural chocolate flavor of any i have had. Hops are certainly there to round the beer out but the 69 IBU's certainly don't come across as bitter at all.  Drinkability: After ever sip you just want more and more. Alcohol is not really picked up on the palate. This beer is just so damn smooth and so damn tasty.

The smell is dominated by (what else) chocolate, but it is a sweet, milk chocolate smell with hints of vanilla. This smells better than some chocolate baked goods I've smelled. The taste follows suit - big dark chocolate flavor with a nice roasted oat finish, absolutely delicious. There is a some carbonation here, which I think could be toned down a little bit. This beer could use a bit more creaminess. I returned from Easter brunch a poured this for dessert & boy, I wish I had a couple more. This is one helluva beer - excellent stuff. Highest recommendation.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,tapman,2.44,"I, as well as a handfull of reviewers out of hundreds, found dissapointment in this beer.  The body is black with a dark mahogany tint when held by a light. The head is brown, but it looks thin like when pouring and MGD. Head fades quickly as suspected.  I found the chocolate smell to be overpowering. Right away you know what you're getting into with this beer. It is a smell of bitter chocolate, and not chocolate malts either. We're talking just ground from the cocoa bean chocolate, not sweet. I later read the ingredients on the bottle, which is a nice touch I must say, but I was dissapointed in ""chocolate flavoring"". Flavoring? So, really they mean a chocolate flavored syrup, am I right? I do hope that there is no high fructose corn syrup in this beer.  Once again I find the chocolate taste completely overpowering. I don't taste any coffee, toffee, or burnt nodes of flavor...just chocolate flavoring. I do believe I bought this beer to taste, well, beer instead of a masking chocolate taste. It finishes with an oat bitterness that is better than the beer when in mid-swig.  Oats and barley help out in this department. Whether the oats are used as an adjunct to improve the mouthfeel or it's actually part of the intended flavor, I do not know. What I do know is that for a stout it was pretty average with the oats and co. helping to just make the deadline.  I hate to sound like a broken record, but the chocolate taste is just too bitter and overbearing. I'm suspicious of the ""flavoring"", but happy that they printed it so I could think about it in the first place. Points for honesty. I won't have another of these for a very long time if I can help it. I would much rather have a Young's Double Choc. Stout (in the bottle, not can). They probably use flavoring, too, but I feel it is done much better.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Color is dead black, with just a hint of brown along the seams of the glass. Basically the best looking beer I've ever seen. Nose is almost all the way coffee, some alcohol hints, and a good amount of sweet chocolately mocha. Taste is intense, to say the least. Lots of roasted malt and coffee bitterness up front. Nice citrus comes in too, but not too much. Them comes the sweeter chocolate on the tip of the tongue. Ends with a nice mix of hoppy bitterness and malty sweet; doesn't overwhelm with bitterness like the Shakespeare.

The first taste to hit is a bit of roasted malt, but is immediately followed the the rich and creamy chocolate flavor mixed with a touch of mocha. The mix of these two principle flavors is what makes this truly spectacular. Very well-balanced.  This brew goes down very smooth and creamy. It reminds me of nice creamy Swiss/Italian chocolate. I would say it is a medium-full body...not too full, but still has a lot to it.  I could drink this one until I am stuffed. An excellent brew.

There is some dark reddish-copper colors at the junction of the beer and the head.  S: Dark Chocolate (obviously), coffee and toffee.  T: The hops hit the taste-buds first, not overpowering but right on and rather balanced. They are only slightly bitter but balance out nicely with the malts and chocolate. Next is the taste of slightly bitter coffee. The aftertaste is that of rich dark, creamy chocolate. It is not overpowering but rather subtle. Not like drinking a chocolate milkshake but more like eating a very dark and bitter chocolate truffle.  M: Chewy with the hops lightly felt on the tongue.  D: This is a very drinkable beer for such a big body. With the first pint it feels and tastes like drinking a slightly bitter coffee. The second pint, as it warms, the smell and taste shift more to the chocolate side of this brew. It's probably not something I will be drinking once a week but it makes for a very good desert beer on it's own or served with desert. A very interesting and intriguing beer.

The head was thick and creamy but diminished quickly.  The smell was awesome. It was so chocolatey and rich with hints of roasted coffee and toffee.  The taste was a dissapointment. It was not very flavorfull at all. It lacked everything that smell made me believe it would taste like.  The mouthfeel was a little gritty, not very smooth.

132,1118,BuckSpin,4.45,"Presentation: c.2005 vintage 22oz bottle, cellared for approximately 18 months, in a classic conical pint glass  While retrieving this beer, I could not help but notice a solid 3/16"" of packed sediment on the bottom of the glass.  Well, its nice (and a bit of a relief to be honest) to hear a decent amount of carbonation as I pour. It pours thick, viscious, yet steadily & softly cracklin' with life.  Nose is insanely deep, making me work at it, like trying to smell a shadow. Deep, rich, mysterious, rich yet subtle stone fruits (black cherry, fig), oily black Cajun coffee, deep roasted malt hues are abundant yet fleeting. Bitter baking chocolate is present, subtle charred wood, charcoal dust. As it warms the chocolate quality rises & grows, as do some wood tones. Head was a nice, lively pinky's worth of loose mocha stained foam, cola like in agitation and song. It sang for a minute, then disappered leaving nary a trace...nada....nothing. Color is the blackest umber imaginable (as I have become fond of saying its ""black in a good mood""), no light getting thru this one.  Hmmm, well that sediment could not have been cocoa! Wonderfully smooth, wet, velvety, rich with milk chocolate. Burnt malts add a pleasing bitter counterweight but are not overpowering. Oh, this is smoooth on the tongue. Caramel qualities rise over the milk chocolate hues, I'm just gonna sit back, relax, and let this baby drive me home taking the long, lazy scenic route! Time has certainly not hurt this. There is a pleasing, eye closing, inhale deeply and sssllooowwly savory exhale quality to the chocolate & caramel tongue feel. I find myself rolling it over & over & over in my mouth, ironically like a candy or piece of chocolate. This is indulgent.  Any subsequent refills of the pint from the 22oz bottle stir a head activity, and each one last longer than the previous, this one leaving a floating sheen and a glass edge ring. Still no lacing.  It evens out on the palate with a milky sweetness rising up, some caramel echoes add to the sweet quality. Malts finally take a stand against all this chocolate and are noticable with a lukewarm, black coffee flatness. It finishes nicely bitter, slightly dry, with a hop kick and some alcohol warmth, which I find a welcome change from all these pleasantries to this point.  I saved a small Hershey's Special Dark bar to try with the last few sips to see what it would do as a trigger. Amazingly the oils in the chocolate made the chocolate & caramel qualities in the stout vanish, making what was a luscious, wet chocolately stout rather dry...interesting.  This was a wonderful, luxurious experience. Can't say I've had a stout like this. I have certainly tasted similar qualities in other stouts, but never like this. I can definitely vouch for this Rogue offering as a cellaring candidate. If you have a chance, put one away for a year or so and taste for yourself.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,StargherKing,3.6,"Pours a dark black, with browns and reds at the edges. Head is a dark cream color, not too thick, not too thin. Smell is very chocolatey, with some coffee and toffee. Dark and roasty all the way with this one. Taste is VERY good, tastes like a hearty stout mixed with chocolate syrup (then again, for all I know, that could be the case). Mouthfeel is thick, but not unpleasant. This one coats the mouth a bit, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The only downside to this beer for me is the drinkability. The richness of it is honestly a bit too much for me. Very good, but I would almost have to down this one as shots. If you have the constitution to overcome the sheer richness of it, and like chocolate stouts, I'd heartily recommend this one. If you're like me, and like something not quite so overpowering, I'd suggest splitting it with a friend. Delicious beer, just hard to drink.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

T - It tasted of dark chocolate and roasted malt. A little bittersweet.  M - It was creamy and buttery. A heavy-bodied beer.  D - An amazing beer. It is like drinking a bar of great dark chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,prototypic,4.28,"Appearance: Pours an opaque, dark brown color (nearly black) with a creamy brown one finger head. Nice retention and decent lacing.  Smell: Very chocolaty smell. It also has a bit of a coffee fragrance along with a smoky, malt smell. Finally, there are hints of toffee that come through.  Taste: Initially, there is a very nice dark chocolate flavor. There's also an espresso/coffee taste that blends very nicely with the chocolate. Lastly, it's malty and tastes smoky.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is a very light and smooth stout. At 6%, it's pretty drinkable. I could down a couple of bombers with ease. Overall, this is a damn good offering from Rogue. Highly recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ultralarry2006,4.5,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle. Leaves a one finger espresso-foam-color head with a little bit of retention and some good spotty lacing. Body is the deepest possible brown. Looks great.  Smell - chocolate and roasted dark malt - mouthwatering !  Taste - chocolate, roasted malt, and lapsang suchong black tea ( a malty tea roasted over pine-wood fire ) . Very, very rich. Also very bitter and very sweet - much like both chocolate and stout each by themselves, much less together !  Mouthfeel - full, smooth, somewhat chewy, and semi-dry, if not outright dry at times.  Drinkability - this is excellent ale, and sessionable to boot. Also would go well for and/or with dessert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jasonjlewis,4.01,"Nice chocolate aroma in the nose and on the palate. I was surprised that there were cascade hops in a dark brew like this. I thought cascades might have worked better, but then the flavor of the beer was impressive and the hops really work nicely. Nice chocolateness to the beer as well as chocolate malts with a roasted characteristic. Not as thick as I like my stouts to be. the only thing disappointing about this beer was the head, which disappated fast. For being such a complex brew with 69 bitterness units, this beer was drinkable. Clings to the mouth well, but not very crisp or full or thick like other stouts.  The beer wasn't as full in the bottle as it could have been, did that effect the appearance? Most people rate it a 4 to 4.5",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kdoc8,3.8,"I had this from a bottle at the Rogue Brewery in Newport, OR. It poured a deep dark brown-black color, not a large or foamy head. It had a mild aroma of chocolate and malt, but not overwhelming. The taste was surprisingly thin and watery for a stout, not full-bodied at all and the flavor of chocoalte wasn't very strong.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kernalklink,4.55,"I have been on the lookout for the perfect chocolate stout- here it is. So sexy creamy black on the pour, with sticky lacing and head. Aromas were slightly coffee like with some undertones of chocolate in the malt. The taste- pure essence of cocoa. Bittersweet chocolate to the max. The absence of cloying sweetness made this brew absolutely delicious. Some mild flowery sweetness, like honey is in the wings to round it out, and the thick body can take it. Goes down so easy- my tastebuds are in heaven.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

This isn't Guiness so don't make the mistake of treating it like Guiness.  Appearance - dark as a no-star night in Maine. So dark you can't find your way through the forest.  Smell - I swear nitro-refrigeration affects the aroma, even if it's only in my mind. Overly cooled brew, no hints of chocolate, cara, or coffee. No hop aroma (not surpising). Just a little bit of bland malty aroma.  Taste - A touch of chocolate. My guess is that due to the nitro-pour, no way this brew was ever going to warm up to a decent temp and consistency in my life time. Bottled is way better. Hops, however light, seemed murdered by the nitro.  Mouthfeel - a little thin  Drinkability - just okay, didn't get a second, which is unusual. Too cold, too bland.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,acrawf6,4.26,"Pours out a pitch black into my tulip glass, no light coming through any of it. Nice thick dark tan rises and eventually drops to a ring around the glass. Pretty good lacing as well. Really looks great in this unibroue glass.  Smell. Has the nice cocoa powder chocolate aroma that gives it a sweetness as well. under that is a touch of coffee- together easily smelling like a chocolate coffee concoction.  Taste. Lots of the chocolate flavor, but on tap i think i get a little more. But still plenty of that flavor. though it says bitterness is at 69 ibu, i dont get too much bitterness, and a bit more sweetness . Small amount of roasted malts under the chocolate, but it really is the chocolate that completely dominates the flavor. This is great if you like the flavor, but part of me thinks this takes away from the complexity of the beer (not a big part though). Aftertaste, i get more bitterness, like a bitter dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel. Body is pretty full, though not as chewy as i would imagine. For it's size, it even has a small slickness to it. Carbonation is at a good level. Balance is pretty nice.  Overall, i really havent had other beers to compare this to that are really so similar. I think it uses the chocolate extemely well in this beer. It's loaded with flavor, and i see this being a great digestif beer, and if not that, a great beer to have on it's own and enjoy it's unique flavors.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

For a sweeter stout, there are others I prefer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mikesgroove,4.6,"Finally got to try this fine Rogue. Poured deep black as night witha big creamy colored, and audibly fizzing head that quickly faded leaving behind a half and inch of thick bubbles that laste almost to the end. Deep thick brown lace dripped down the glass. Very full looking. Smell was off course dark german chocolate, roasted or smoked smells wafted through as well. Roasted coffee and chocolate mousse as it warmed delighted the senses. Rich, smells like a chocolate dessert, very strong. Tastes followed suit well. Strong roasted chocolate, soo much chocolate, incredible, tasted like smoked pudding, Very nice. Carbonation made it very lively, and a dry finish capped it off very well. This is a big dessert bear, easily the most filling beer I have ever tried. I actually felt bloated after this. No real alcohol at all detected in this, and at a low ABV I wouldn't expect one. Suge huge bold flavors in such a low ABV are a welcome treat and make this very drinkable. The smooth, creamy, full flavor and texture and overall chocolate overload make this the perfect night cap, very well done.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BeerCheese,3.3,"Took the bottle from the fridge and poured it right into a clean glass. Completely black with a big brown head. Great head retention and lacing. Almost odorless, which was strange. May have been a hint of chocolate in the smell, or it could just be in my mind because of the name. Medium carbonation with a medium/full body. Seemed a little bland for a stout, but the little bit of flavor that was there was very nice. I could certainly taste the chocolate and roasted malts. Good balance of hops too. No taste of alcohol present. Overall, a slightly above average stout that's very drinkable. I'm still stumped by the lack of smell, though, which really brings the score down for this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,aalappatel,3.73,I had this from a 22oz bomber bottle. Poured an almost black liquor with a one finger off white head that dissipated almost immediately. The smell was reminicent of earthy and chocolatey tones. There is an initial bitterness that quickly turns to a smokey choclate flavor. It lingers in the mouth for a while. The mouthfeel is quite heavy. This is definitely not your watery yellow fizzy beer !,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smell: Fresh cream, chocolate, I also smell sweetened coffee and some irish cream.  Taste: Big chocolate malt stays through out, at first it's complimented with an espresso acidity, then becomes creamy with those irish cream notes, a faint hint of hops come in at the end and dries it up.  Mouthfeel: Fizzy, light carbonation, medium to full bodied, clean and easy to drink, very dry finish.  Drinkability: A great brew, light, chocolatey and delicious.

132,1118,lawrence76,3.75,"Poured on draft at bukowski's -2/19/2007 on a cold night.  Appears very dark in the glass, red when held up to the light. A deep, tan head formed and left exquisite lacing on the sides of the glass.  Aroma is of chocolate and heady malts.  Hop bitterness becomes apparent upon the first sip. Excellent body to this beer. A certain grittiness is evident, likely from the use of flaked barley or un-malted oats; simply wonderful on the pallette. More deep malts & some caramelized aspects are present, and a subtle hop aroma which compliments rather than distracts.  A wonderful stout to have on a cold winter night.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,vanrassel,4.03,"You can see by the marks, I think this is a good beer  I just don't know if I'd consider it ""Top 100"" good.  It poured into my pint glass opaque and almost black, like viscous motor oil. An attractive bubbly tan head formed, and it didn't quit as long as there was beer in mmy glass. Not surprisingly, chocolate figured big in the aroma, sweet with a backing of toasted malt.  A simple first impression of the taste is that is what like a quality dark chocolate bar. Deeper examination revealed malted milk and a slightly lighter, sweeter taste than first perceived. Coffee emerged in the finish, but it was more Colombian roast than espresso.  Overall, the low carbonation and full body made this a smooth, creamy brew. It's a pleasant experience, in small doses: after half a bomber, I was ready for something else.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

It does not stick around after a few sips are taken and turns into just a little ring where the liquid meets the glass. The beer is black and not much light gets through on the edges.  S- Chocolate hits at first then some coffee and more hops than expected. The chocolate smells like a chocolate powder like Nes Quick or something.  T- Not as sweet as I was expecting. The chocolate is the flavor that sticks out most in this- big surprise. There is a good earthiness to the beer as well. The hops blend really well with the chocolate.  M- Creamy, but not overly done.  D- It seems like this could be a hard beer to get as right as Rogue did. The best part about this beer is how well balanced everything is.

132,1118,BigRedN,4.88,"Appearance: Poured from the 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer is black. when held to a light it's still black. The pour produces a large, foamy, brown head nearly two inches thick. The head never really dies, falling to a solid cover on the liquid leaving lots of lace. One of the prettier beers I have seen, it also helps that I like the ""dark"" beers and go for the black look.  Smell: What else would you expect from a chocolate stout but lots of chocolate and roasted malts aromas. Some decent hops aromas are buried within as well.  Taste: What can I say but this beer suits me. I like'em big and malty with planty of roasted malts and a touch of hop bitterness on the finish. This beer delivers. Not sweet at all, (I would even say it is a bit bitter) with just enough chocolate flavors but not overbearing. A great stout.  Mouthfeel: Rich, smooth and creamy. Full bodied , a touch chewy. Limited alchohol, if it wasn;t so filling this could be a decent sessioner because it is so good.  Drinkability: This is one of the best beers I have ever had. The End.

132,1118,ccrida,4.64,"Poured on draft, the Chocolate Stout is a deep, dark reddish black, with a thick, 2 finger, creamy, medium-dark tan head. Sadly, the head didn't stick around to long and only left slight lace. Very nice, rich but not oily, especially with that head. The aroma, yummm, thats great! All chocolate, sweet, but like coco, not sugar. The taste follows suit, it is fantastic, very chocolaty, some oats and a bit of cola. You can really taste the difference between stouts with chocolate malt and ones like this that also use the real thing, very nice. There's also a fairly assertive hop presence, particularly on the finish, which is probably the main differentiator between this and Young's Double Chocolate, which is similarly fantastic real chocolate goodness. The mouthfeel is fantastic, super creamy, but supple and light, almost like a nitro, but with more carbonation. Whoa, this is super drinkable. I could have these all night!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The head subsides but begins as exceptionally creamy. The smell is raisiny with very rich, dark chocolate moving to the front. Cocoa fills the nose. The taste is incredible, rich and smooth yet dark and a surprising (if you don't read the bottle) entrance of hops that get stronger on the finish. A bit smoky and a ton delicioius.

S: Loads of chocolate. Slight whiff of coffee. Roasted malts and earth.  T: Slight blast of burnt coffee is immediately taken over by dark chocolate and a slight pine hop bitter bite. Roasted caramel malts are followed by the sweetness of molasses. More chocolate.  M: Rich and creamy smooth. Minimal carbonation. Slightly dry.  D: Grandma's homemade brownies in a bottle.

The aroma was an almost indescribable abundance of chocolate with usual stout undertones of roasted barley and subtle coffee, all very overpowered by chocolate, however. The taste was great but just a tad on the bitter side as far as the chocolate was concerned. The mouthfeel was fully tolerable with decent carbonation.

The body is oily black, opaque, seriously does look like an I.S. Smells of subtle light smoky chocolate character, which permeates the totality of this drink. The roasted barley and oaks (as listed on the bottle) manifests and aids nicely to form an earthy well-rounded complexity. The cascades at first were rather forward, but as this warms up they mellow out and the chocolate is allowed to come to the fore. Taste wise this beer is rich bitter chocolate and coffee. Has many flavor components of a sturdy RIS, but simply lacks the strength and thicker mouthfeel. I realize this is not what they were going for, but worth mentioning. The mouthfeel definitely has a literal chocolate residual feel ""made with imported chocolate"". This is very much a worth while stout. The complexity of an Imperial stout, but the strength and mouth feel of a standard stout. Totally worth a drink.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Towering chocolate mousse head takes a few minutes to settle down. One of the best looking pours I have ever had in my Duvel tulip.  S - Very nice. I bought this one out of the beer cooler, as it was the only choice. It's about 5 below outside and the beer sat in the truck for a while as I stopped for some fatwood to kickstart tonight's fire. I think I'm drinking this one a little cold, but I couldn't wait. I'm guessing the aroma will open up a bit as I type. Chocolate and coffee overtones, with a faint raisin burnt malt bitterness, almost a mincemeat hint.  T - Outstanding. I was torn between this or the Shakespeare tonight. I'm glad I got this one. This beer is very very tasty.  M - Wonderful. Full, creamy, broad across the palate and very nice all the way down. Leaves a nice tongue and gullet coating.  D - Low ABV makes this one a good candidate for a winter evening session. I'm a little out of ""beer shape"", so two will be quite enough thank you.  A break was just what I needed.

Looks like a beer to be reckoned with.  The scent is the only detractor of this stout. Bitter-sweet chocolate, rich malts and a distracting tinny hint that has hints of rubbing alcohol in it.  Taste is rich bitter-sweet chocolate, notes of brown sugar and a malts. Slight acid essence. This is a satisfying, enjoyable stout with a definite chocolate character.

132,1118,beveritt,4.73,"Presentation: Poured from a 22 oz bomber into an Imperial pint glass. The label has the standard Rogue theme of someone holding a beer up. In addition, it has the always useful information about the beer ingredients and specifications. This one is 15 degrees Plato, 69 IBU, 77 AA, and 135.45 degrees L.  Appearance: Pours with a dark tan, 1 inch head. This settles slowly, leaving some lacing on the glass, a thin coat of foam, and a few random islands spread throughout the top. The beer itself is dark, black except for a little hint of ruby/brown around the edges.  Smell: Sweet chocolate, with a strong undertone of roasted barley. The smell is an amazing blend of sweet and bitter.  Taste: This beer has many complex layers of chocolate and stout flavor. Initially, you pick up what I would term bitter, baker's chocolate, this blends well with the bitterness from the roasted barley. Next, there is a subtle hop, flavor, lightly citrus with a hint of bitterness, Finally, a sweet chocolate aftertaste, without being to sweet or cloying.  Mouthfeel: Average level of carbonation with a decent bite. Helps to blend the varying flavors well. God body.  Drinkability: In a world of so many Imperial this and double that, it is nice to find a full bodied and flavorful stout that only clocks in a 6% alcohol. This is a great drink and one that you can have a few of. Plenty of complexity, while still demonstrating the fine art of restraint.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

All of the great things about the bottle just come alive in fantastic ways in the draft version of this brew. The chocolate aroma and flavor just come out to greet you and taste great. Many a non-dark beer drinker will change their tune after having one of these.

There is a nice smoky flavor that comes through in the end which makes for a full flavorful finish.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full with just enough carbonation.

132,1118,terrabyte,4.07,"Poured a very thick, black color with a monstrous dark-brown head.  Aroma obviously consists of chocolate, but mixed well with coffee. Not as strong as I expected it to be since it is showcasing Chocolate so much.  This could easily replace my morning coffee. Oh, if only real life didn't get in the way! The chocolate flavor of this beer is the kind you might find in your coffee: A nicely melted, milky chocolate with lots of bitterness. Mix that with coffee, or maybe espresso, and you have this beer. The aftertaste is quite bitter which works great for this combo, sine you're not sure if it's bitter chocolate, bitter coffee, or both you're tasting.  Mouthfeel is low carbonation, silky smooth like silk milk, and kind of sticky in the aftertaste, but it's full of taste that has you smacking your mouth trying to suck the flavor out.  Drinkability is quite high. A surprisingly under-the-top flavor-wise, but extremely enjoyable. So many times I have tasted chocolate or cherry-chocolate beers that taste fake & powdered. This one tastes real and is controlled, balanced, and enjoyable. Yet the price of not being overwhelming is to be somewhat boring. I've had beers with more chocolate before that weren't showcasing chocolate as the main ingredient. I was expecting more then from this one.  There is some small print on the bottle that brags of imported chocolate. I'm not sure if they should of bothered. I couldn't tell the difference since the chocolate wasn't a very strong component.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

It produces a rich dark and creamy head and sticks around a while, eventually dissipating into fine lacing.  Initially I detected the mellow smooth chocolaty character, but was later replaced by the presence of burnt malt and a slight citrus kick. Not the typical coffee flavors typical of stouts. It feels very smooth at first, but finishes a bit dry.  Altogether this is a great brew, and is a dessert in itself.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jcdiflorio,4.7,"served into a nonic glass from a 22 oz. brown bomber crimp cap  Opaque,black with a mocha head thats very thick,dense becoming rocky leaving a thick pillow of foam sitting on top of the beer. Good retention,chuncky lacing all over the sides of the glass.  Awesome chocolate aroma,intense chocolate notes,smell like a cup of hot chocolate, reminded me of my trip to the Hereshey factory.If you love chocolate,who doesn't? this aroma will make you drool all over. Also showing through are hints of carmell/toffee and some of the rolled oats. Chocolate all the way here though.  Taste: chocolate of course! The best tasting chocolate i've ever tasted in a beer. Once your past the chocolate taste a very complex maltiness appears that's carmelly,roasty,coffee like,burnt notes. Great malt tastes after the rush of chocolate. Finishes with a sharp,crisp,slightly dry citrus taste that's very pleasing with chocolate overtones. An amazing tasting beer. If you love stouts and chocolate this is the beer for you !  A thick and very creamy mouthfeel,even sticky,I loved it. I didn't think at first taste this beer would be very drinkable,but the more I drank the more drinkable this beer became. Would be filling after a while or it would had gotten a 5. I been trying not to give out a lot of 5's,If this was my first review I would have given this beer all 5's easily. This beer is that damn good. Seek out this beer and give it a try. Warning: if you don't like chocolate don't even attempt to try this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The best ""chocolate stout"" I've ever had.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,theopholis,4.37,"Appearance- Black. There's no other way to say it. This stuff is black. Not even any color when veiwing it through to a light. Wow. Head is brown, and fairly substantial, but disappears very quickly. Leaves some decent lace tho.  Aroma- Lots of roasted malt and bittering hops. An AMAZING amount of chocolate nose.  Taste- Wow. This stuff is chocolaty. Good dark chocolate. Nicely blended with the normal stout tastes, good mellow bitterring hops, nice malt character. As it warms, a distinct roasted coffe taste takes over.  Mouthfeel- Kind of thin for the style, but not bad. More like a bitter or porter. Carbonation level is good to.  Drinkability- It's a stout, and hence not easy drinking. Still, very interesting and very nice on a cold night or with a big juicy flavorful steak. Well worth a try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,paulthebeerguru,4.32,"I poured this 22 oz. bottle into an imperial pint glass. The beer pours a deep, black nectar that leaves a milk chocolate head hanging off the rim of the glass. The aroma is nothing but choclolate, chocolate, chocolate! After the first sip, there is rich, chocolate lacing on the inside of the glass. After another sip, I can taste the rich imported chocolate, and then the roasted malts come in. The beer tends to finish a little sweeter than the initial sip. I recommend this brew as a great desert beer, or a great change of pace beer for the long term drinker. Cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Sweet chocolate milk scent with abit of butter, the scent feels very round and soft. Strangely bitter and sweet smoke flavor up front quickly changing to a more pronounced smoke and bittersweet chocolate flavor. Aftertaste is a fairly mellow experience of darker bittersweet chocolate and restrained hops. Moderate to full body and ok coating, abit dry. Pretty good drinkability and a good brew but did expect alot more from this brew, especially from a brewery with Rogue's reputation. I must say I've had better and more powerful chocolate flavors from brews without added chocolate flavoring.  -Oelergud",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A little sweet, a little winey, a little malty, and a little sour with that undefineable chocolate aroma as well. Taste is similar. Not hugely malty and sweet, but more subtle. Very nice chocolate flavor, pure and rich with high quality chocolate. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but quite smooth. Not the vreamiest stout out there, but a little tannic bitterness from the chocolate helps to not make it cloying either and heightens the drinkability. The good quality chocolate in this beer really makes a difference. Quite nice.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,shadow1961,4,"Rogue's Chocolate Stout pours a creamy brown head (it doesn't last long) over a black brew. The nose is rich with dark malt, mocha, and a bit of dark fruit. The flavor is dark malt, a bit of unsweetened chocolate, and hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and dry, and the aftertaste is of mild hops. Flavorful belches. It's not as overbearing as some stouts, yet is still rich and filling. It's still no lightweight though- it's for slow sipping and dark thoughts in the dead of winter...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Chocolate, oats, dark roasted malts, a little bit of hoppiness. T: Chocolate, lots of chocolate, bittersweet malt, and some hoppy flavor from the cascades. (kind of reminded me of a toned down IPA.)

Poor head retention but good lacing.  S: Roasted malt and some good dark chocolate.  T: Good dark chocolate, not the normal crap some beers push, coffee, and roasted malty goodness. Very good.  M: Slightly creamy but thinner than expected, more porter-like. Complex enough, yet not trying too hard.  D: Easier than some stouts, due to its thinness. Yet, it's still a chocolate beer, making it sweet and not very sessionable. 1 bomber at a time is plenty.  Another good dark brew from Rogue. I liked the mocha and now the chocolate. The only reason the chocolate scored lower was the thinness of the stout. I hear that west coast stouts are thinner. Either way, it is still good. Next stop on the Rogue train is the Shakespeare Stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,strangefate,4.32,"22oz bottle.  Pours a typical stout appearance - jet black with a thin-medium head that dissipates quickly and leaves some lacing. You can tell this isn't just chocolate malt. The bottle says that it's made from ""imported chocolate"" and you can really smell and taste the chocolate. The chocolate taste is very noticeable, afterwards a hint of caramel malt is detected. A medium-bodied stout with a great drinkability. This is a beer you let your friends try just so that they can taste the real chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,geexploitation,3.51,"Pours a completely opaque black color, with a tenacious tan head that sticks to the side of the glass. Aromas of dry, almost dusty chocolate flavors -- it reminds me of baker's chocolate. There is a milky, creamy backing to the aroma -- maybe due to the oats? On the palate, some stout sourness first off, medium carbonation and some juicy acidity. The chocolate flavor is quite dry, not sweet, and the finish is a bit short. Overall, I was disappointed by this. The chocolate flavor was a bit flat, almost subdued, and there's not much else going on in this beer to make up for it. Mouthfeel is too thin, and the staying power of this beer is kind of lacking. What's a mellifluous term for ""enh""?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,flexabull,4.07,"Pours thick dark black, big tan bubbles in the head that quickly faded.  Beer smells of creamy dark chocolate,with a bit of a malty sweetness.  Tastes of dark chocolate is the first flavor I notice, carbonation is noted. Also there are a bit of a hop bitterness and creamy malts on the finish.  Mouthfeel to me seems a bit over carbonated, but the flavors sure linger well... this mouthfeel might be a touch too light for a stout  A tasty and drinkable stout.

Just sweet enough. I suppose it is possible for a beer to be better than this, but it would be darn tough.  This beer leaves Young's Double Chocolate in the dust, and Young's ain't chump change.  The only downside is that availability is poor in the Dallas area.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Slow to fall, rich and sustainable.  Initial smell yielded a generous dose of anise/liquorice-like notes. Rich, intense chocolate cake sweetness with powdered sugar. Spicy aroma. Bready, with a good deal of malts. I could smell this for days.  Burnt caramel malts, rich and roasted, but not overpowering. Hints of sweetness and a lactic, milky character. Bready, and also quite chewy. Espresso bean notes. Sweet, chocolatey finish with a semi-bitter bite that subtly hangs out in the background. Noticeable carbonation with a smooth, full body.

132,1118,schusterbauer,4.85,"pours an opaque black that seems to have brown swirling throughout, with a tan head that is pretty large to begin with, and persists while drinking. smells like chocolate bars being melted to make hot chocolate. tastes like chocolate, dark chocolate, and that's almost it. a slight hop bitterness keeps things fresh tasting. nothing exactly balanced here, but that's clearly not the goal. where other chocolate stouts seek to add chocolate to the stout experience, this beer merely uses the stout as a chocolate delivery device. mouthfeel is amazing -- silky smooth and very thick. it might become too thick after more than one bottle, but for one serving, it's just about perfect. drinkability is impaired only by the chocolatey nature of the beer, and that it is so rich as a result.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bgraney,4.23,"Pours thick black, almost like molasses with a fluffy espresso head. Definite chocolate aroma backed by charcoal-like malt.

132,1118,WanderingFool,4.27,"Rogue Chocolate Stout pours an inky black with a thick, creamy tan head on top. The foam dissolves slowly to a ring around the beer and leaves behind a nice netted pattern of lace behind as it dissolves. The aroma is all chocolate with just a hint of floral hops mixed in.  Each sip of this medium bodied beer is very tasty, but a little thin. It begins with a chocolate flavor that reminds me of a chocolate easter rabbit. Towards the middle some of the roasted malt bitterness pokes through and at the end there's a hint of floral hops. Once gone the chocolate flavor lingers on the tongue.  This is one tasty, easy to drink chocolate. However, I had to take a point away for mouth feel because I thought it was a little thin. Other than that I highly recommend it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

M - Thick, syrupy, but pleasantly so.  D - This trumps Young's. It's not something I'd drink often, but my girlfriend loves it.

132,1118,ski271,4.13,"Very dark brown, almost black, with a small, creamy, tan, slowly diminishing head. Smells of rich roasted malt with lots of chocolate. Some dark chocolate in there but its the good dose of milk chocolate thats most notable. Actually, yes, it smells a little like chocolate milk (in a good way) accompanied by light brown sugar and grainy bread. The taste follows suit with the chocolate presence taking center stage. Big and malty with being overbearing, some very light berry in there too. The finish is pleasantly bitter and dry, and improves as the beers warms. At first the body seems huge but it thins a bit toward the finish, making this beer big and satisfying while remaining easy-drinking. Its creamy-turning-dry texture and medium-low carbonation are also nice. Not a bad beer overall. Interesting and definitely worth trying, but not one of my favorite Rogue beers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BeerSox,4.52,"Bomber into mug.  Pours like motor oil creating an opaque black appearance with a thick fizzy brown head that settles to a thin fuzzy cap. Sticky lacing along the glass.  Dark malts dominated by dark chocolate scents and light creaminess.  Bitter malts complimented by bitter dark chocolate flavors, along with some bittering hops in the finish. The bittersweet chocolate lingers in the mouth for a while. Very thick and chewy feel with a slightly dry finish. Each gulp imparts a crisp bite from the higher carbonatoin.  A superb brew by Rogue. This thing is loaded with chocolate. The 22oz makes it its own desert, or if you like, its own meal. I highly recommend this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jubnat,4.27,"22 oz. bottle. Poured very dark brown, opaque, with a dark tan head. As I tasted it I instantly thought of chocolate waffles. Then it brought on a more roasted flavor. Very nice, not too overpowering. Not too chocolatey, which is good. Flavor develops nicely in my mouth. But the aroma has most of the chocolate, a nice start to each sip. Great aftertaste. Somehow, its quite a refreshing drink. Really very tasty. Nice take on an American stout. But I think I'll try out some of the other Rogue beers before going back to this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DieselSnorter,3.77,"After seeing how highly rated this offering was, I had to try one. My only other experience with chocolate stouts was Young's, which I enjoyed a lot.  poured out pitch black with a very dark brown head that didn't really last very long and also did little in the way of lacing. It still freaks my neighbors out when they see me drinking something that resembles motor oil and I call it ""beer"".  It smelled much like a chocolate stout should. Kind of a toasted chocolate combination.  Not as sweet as I was expecting, definitely not as sweet as Youngs, and a bit more bitter as well. It had a definite hop flavor toward the end as well.  it seemed a bit thin to me, not as thick and creamy as I would have liked, but not bad at all.  I can see me drinking this once in a while, but probably not on a too regular basis.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,uberabr,4.89,"A: Poured from a 22 into a pint. I like the Rogue bottles, kind of a rotoscope approach. Unique styling. As far as the beer itself, stouts are harder to review in this department. What can I say, its pitch black. A light brown head that forms and dies within a few minutes. Pitch black.  S: Wow. This is definitely a chocolate stout! Not just chocolate hints, this one smells just like a fresh chocolate candy bar. A syrupy cocoa. There were definitely some heavy adjuncts used here, but thats not exactly a secret, and it'd be impossible to get this level of chocolate out of pure malt anyway. Very, very nice. Now I know what chocolate really smells like. I would give it a 6 if I could.  T: Nice and sweet. Rich and creamy with a dark milk-chocolate flavor and subtle hints of deep roasted espresso. Some cream, wheat, and delicate mint.  M: Excellent. Full body without being totally syrupy; a delicate mix of water, sweetness, and carbonation.  D: This is an extremely drinkable stout. Ive always liked Youngs Double-Chocolate, but this one blows it out of the water. This is how a chocolate stout should taste. Simple, chocolate, and an appropriate, modest, stout mouthfeel. This beer is really a delight.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,largadeer,4.28,"I've had this one on draft, cask and in bottles; it's consistently excellent.  Appearance: Dark brown and opaque with a rich caramel-colored head.  Smell: Awesome dark chocolate smell from a mile away. One of the more pleasantly aromatic beers out there.  Taste & mouthfeel: Dark chocolate in the forefront with toasty, bready undertones and a slightly hoppy finish. Very balanced flavor, leaning on the dry side. Rich and medium-to-full in body, velvety and smooth on the tongue.  Drinkability: For the style, this is drinkable to the extreme. I can easily have a few pints of this in one sitting.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Totally drinkable and enjoyable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

S: Chocolate notes strong w/ coffee and malty aromas present, but not overpowering.  T: Heavier than expected coffee-like flavor, w/cocoa chocolate notes throughout. Toasty malt taste within, but not at the forefront. Smooth all-around, and similar in this regard to the hazelnut nectar.  M: Syrupy and sticky on the palate in the finish. Carbonation a little on the high side, but not bad for this particular brew.  D: Due to the sharper coffee notes, I might be inclined to keep it limited. Still, good for another, especially suited for dessert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,msubulldog25,4.2,"Enjoyed a pint pour with a bit of espresso/chocolate truffle at Pix Patisserie in Portland, OR. (Happy Birthday to my mother-in-law!) Have had this beer once or twice before, but it's been a while...  A: Rich deep brown with a lingering creamy tan-colored head. Very nice lacing. S: Initial cocoa and toasted malt are sweet, a deeper more bittersweet (emphasis on 'bitter') dark chocolate follows. Delicious, enticing aromas. T: Upfront bitterness of the deepest, richest chocolate - quite roasted & bittered by hops. Mellows to a sweeter cocoa with a softer malty/grainy smoothness. M: Full mouthfeel & body. A wonderful cream consistency, slightly carbonated, with a nice lengthy bittersweet finish. D: A fine porter, balanced well, though a tad on the bitter side. It's got 'chocolate' without being overbearing. A very nice pint to enjoy alone or with dessert. The Rogue Chocolate Stout Float is a dessert drink I have yet to try, but plan to do so in the near future (they serve them at Rogue and at Pix - supposedly 'invented' by local beer writer Fred Eckhardt, I think...).",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Less chocolate & more vanilla than I expected. Good mouthful, really good taste. Rogue Chocolate is probably one of my top 5-10 stouts. Id also recommend trying Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout and especially Youngs Double Chocolate Stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Osiris9588,4.42,"It's an opaque black, topped with a creamy, milk-chocolate head--solid retention and decent lacing.  The smell consists of toasted malt, coco, and chocolate. It tastes like a big glass of chocolate milk, except better. Oats, roasted malt, coco, cream, and just a touch of bitterness from the hops, results in a tasty treat of a brew.  The mouth is mellow and creamy on the front, and the dryness of the malt and coco, followed by the assertion of hops, results in a delightfully bittersweet finish. A truly enjoyable stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,dblinkhorn,4.18,"Poured from a 650ml bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance - Pitch black brew with a dark tannish brown head that is about a finger thick and very creamy. THe head has good retention, and eventually settles at a half-finger velvet head on top of the brew. Lacing here and there on the glass on the way down.  Smell - Major chocolate aromas up front, milk chocolate and dark chocolate. Buttery caramel and molasses brings a wonderful sweetness to the smell. There are some hops bitterness just behind the sweet and chocolate aromas. Rich roasted and bready (pudding-like) malt character ties it all together. Very little alcohol aroma, if any.  Taste - An equal mix of super oily hops bitterness mixed with dark and bitter chocolate flavors. A butter sweetness comes through second and helps to balance the initial bitterness from the hops and dark chocolate. Very thickly rich roasted malt character with some earthiness and creamy chocolate finish after this. The aftertaste brings back some oily hops bitterness, but is mainly creamy chocolate and some malt. Again, almost no noticeable alcohol.  Mouthfeel - Full-bodied and very smooth, but a tad over-carbonated in my opinion. The carbonation kind of has that foaming effect in your mouth that detracts from an otherwise solidly smooth and full mouthfeel. Still superb, though, but not perfect.  Drinkability - As per the style, this stuff is rich and strong, and as a result the drinkability must suffer.  A wonderful chocolate stout. I'm never surprised at the quality brews that Rogue brews. This stout is not disgustingly chocolatey, but right on the money. It has a nice mix of bitterness and buttery sweetness, set on a rich roasted malt canvas. Highly recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Deconstructionis,3.8,This is the first beer i felt compelled to review again in a different serving type. I did not think the on-tap version was near as good as the bottled version. The following are what i gave the bottles:  appearance: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 3.5  The tap version looked just as good but the chocolate and sweetness were far more prominent than in the bottled version-- to the point of being a little overwhelming and seriously detracting from drinkability.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,barefootbrewer,4.27,"This beer poured a thick oily looking liquid with a nice cream colored head. The smell is sweet like a mild chocolate. The taste is heavy and sweet.

132,1118,umfskibum,4.5,"22 oz bottle with Rogue's typical nice artwork.  Appearance: Pours a deep black color. No light gets through this baby. The head is a nice frothy brown and a good size. Nice lacing down the sides of the glass right to the finish.  Smell: Wow, you can smell the chocolate in this beer! This beer fills your nostrils with the smells of bitter dark chocolate and roasted malt, with some hints of oaks. This scent is rich and wonderful - Rogue could sell Chocolate Stout air fresheners.  Taste: Smooth and creamy. Not a sweet or milk chocolate flavor, but a nice bitter dark chocolate taste. Full bodied. Strong tastes from the roasted malts. Just a little bit of oat and smoke flavors and hoppiness, but almost all CHOCOLATE. Tasty.  Mouthfeel: Again, smooth and creamy. Rogue's Chocolate Stout feels wonderful across the palate, and thankfully isn't and heavy or thick as one might expect.  Drinkability: Delicious, but definately a dessert stout. The chocolate flavors and creamy texture make this perfect to pair with a chocolate dessert.  Other: An OUTSTANDING beer. Unlike some other stouts out there, this beer truly tastes of chocolate and has a rich, full flavor.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Taste is dominated by bitter chocolate. Also some roasted malts and burnt coffee. Quite strong flavor.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, cleansing and somewhat more lively than most stouts. Dry finish.  Overall, quite impressive. Very drinkable and very pleasant. Sort of like liquid chocolate. Would probably be great in a stout float.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Brewlore,4.11,"Pours black as night with a fantasic dark tan colored head that pours big and gently fades and lingers around. It smells great as well with roasted malts and a chocolate scent dominating the scent, a very inviting scent.  The taste is quite chocolatey with some nice bitterness and some sweet malt flavors coming in. It's a really balanced beer that offers some nice flavors as it runs across the palate. The chocolate and bitterness are well balanced.  It's mouthfeeel is grand, it's a bit tingly and full bodied on the palate. It leaves your mouth a bit dry afterwards but surely does not take away from the overall experience. Leaves a little bitter aftertaste which is quite nice.  This beer is highly drinkable though I wouldn't want to sit and have more than couple pints of this stuff. It's a bit heavy so it can be quite filling especially if your drinking it with some desserts.  In the end Rogue makes a wonderful chocolate stout. It's one of the better ones currently on the market. Cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,pweis909,3.92,"This beer is chocalety like no other chocolate stout I've had. Actually uses choclate flavoring, so no great surprise. It pours quite dark with a tawny foam. Big foam, initially, as in ""my cup runneth over"" but it calmed down. Perhaps the oats are giving it foam? In the smell and taste department, well, did I mention chocolate? That really is the reason to drink this one -- it's easy to forget it is beer -- the hops and malt take a back seat. Sweet, but not cloying. In the mouthfeel department, it sort of dries my mouth out after each swallow, leaving a powdery feel. I find it interesting but not really one that I would try regularly.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Zoh,4.92,"Poured from a 22oz silkscreened bottle and split with a friend. Appearance is black with no chance of light penetrating the beer. Thick tan head that maintains itself until the beer is gone. Smell is dark roasted malt with a load of dark chocolate. Some coffee hints as well. Taste is heavenly. Evenly balanced dark malts with bitter chocolate combine to form a nearly perfect beer. Coffee and blackened malt hints creep in as well. Mouthfeel is thick but very palateable. Drinkability is also way up there, I could have glass after glass of this. Overall, one of the best beers that I have ever had.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,rarevos,4.52,"Poured from 22 oz bomber into snifter.  A: Pours a rich, jet-black with loads of dark tan head. Head has phenomenal staying power.  S: Chocolate, and more chocolate. A hint of coffee, and a slight roasty quality.  T: Very dark, rich, bitter chocolate. Not sweet chocolate, but semi-sweet or bitter chocolate. Has a touch of cream to the front, and a bit of caramel in there, too. Finish is long, has a mild bitterness wrapped up in a burnt tail.  M: Lightly syrupy, full-bodied.  D: This is fantastic. The bitterness and burned quality make it abundantly clear that you're not drinking chocolate milk. This is a terrific dessert beer. This is, believe it or not, my first beer from Rogue. I've got a few more bombers in my beer cabinet, and I'm now really looking forward to them. A wonderful introduction to the brewery. I'm hooked.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jtell,4.3,"Served from a bomber. Pours a pure black with no light passing through. Got a lot of head out of a normal pour. Kind of surprised by that. Really liked the dark, rich look of the beer. Definitely has a liquid, dark chocolate look to it. One person commented that it looked like hot chocolate. Smell is pure chocolate. Taste is alcoholic chocolate milk. Picked it because we were having smores and it was a hit. Mouthfeel was rich and oily, in a good way. Really was just like a liquified chocolate bar. Drinkability is lower because it is really sweet and rich. Split the bomber between four people and it was a good amount. Could definitely replace dessert after a meal.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,NolateM,4.57,"Poured into a good old fashioned MUG. Appearance is blacker than the eyes of the grim reaper, and the head is thick and rich and brown... awesome retention, but not much lacing.  The aroma is TOTALLY CHOCOLATE.  The flavor... holy lord. Delicious roasted malts, and elegant dark chocolate. Maybe even milk chocolate, a little bit! A hint of rich coffee is in there as well. The hop bitterness comes through more as it warms, and kinda hits the side of the tongue to give it a little bit of an acidic bite. Mouthfeel is creamy and slightly drying, but not too drying.  For drinkability... really you don't want to sit down and drink several mugs of this. This is a beer to have one glass of, or maybe two if you feel like keeping the bomber to yourself. This is what I'd prefer to have instead of dessert... or I suppose you could have this with dessert too.  As far as recommending this... come on, does Rogue even MAKE an unimpressive brew? This is one of my favorite stouts. Buy it NOW.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,auntfloyd,4.03,"Served from a 22 oz bomber into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter designed with this style in mind.  Pours a perfect black, totally opaque; thick but not too dense. Seriously, holding this thing up to a light shows that absolutely nothing makes it through this. Very small light brown head that quickly recedes.  The nose is chocolate, full on. Very sweet, with slight maltiness. The smell is almost of something baked, like a very nice chocolate cake.  The taste fully lives up to the aroma: this is a chocolate beer, for chocolate lovers. The taste upfront is all semisweet chocolate, merging into a more bitter roasty-chocolate flavor, finally fading into a light hoppy bitterness at the end.  The mouthfeel is fairly light, with a carbonation level that's just about right. The drinkability is high, though obviously this is more a sipping beer than anything else.  Overall, this is a very good chocolate stout, with stronger emphasis on the chocolate than other versions (such as Brooklyn's or Young's). Another tasty brew from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RedHaze,4.08,"Pours a deep black that doesn't let any light through, with a two finger dark tan head that fades slowly to a thick cap, leaving behind a very nice webbing of lace.  Smell; dominant chocolate aroma up front, with some roasted malts intermingled with some hints of coffee.  Taste; as with the smell the chocolate is the dominant flavor, which isn't surprising since this is a chocolate stout. A touch of coffee bitterness is oresent, as well as a little bit of a smokey quality. this isn't to complex in the flaovr department, but it is still very good. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, and fits the flavor profile almost prefectly. The only thing that limits the drinkability is the heaviness of the beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,EPICAC,4.62,"I purchased this last night at Downtown Wine & Spirits. I let it warm to around 50º F and served it in my NERAX pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a deep black with ruby tints at the edges. It's topped by a thick, fluffy, brown head that thins to a persistent quarter-inch layer, that leaves patchy lace on the glass.  Smell: The aroma is very chocolatey. The first whiff is a very nice sweet chocolate. Swirling the beer brings out some nice tart fruity aromas. There are also hints of dark roast under the strong chocolate aroma. The smell is great, but makes me fear that the beer will be too heavy on the sweet chocolate flavors.  Taste: My first impressions are strong roasty flavors throughout, with some sweet chocolate hints. I first notice some mingling sweetness and roasty flavors that move into tart fruitiness. The finish is a nice mix of sweet chocolate and roasted and hop bitterness. Unlike the aroma the roasty flavors are strong and not overwhelmed by the chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, high carbonation, lightly silky.  Drinkability: The chocolate isn't overpowering, and the roasty flavors provide a good balance.  Overall: I was afraid this beer would be too sweet, with very dominant chocolate flavors, but the roasted bitterness is high with the sweet chocolate providing a nice balance.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Wasatch,4.35,"A - Pours black in color, some carbonation, nice creamy tan head that lasts a long time, nice lacing afterwards.  S - Scents of sweet malts and chocolate.

132,1118,cracgor,3.69,"Very dark velvety black beer with a dark tan, barely red in it, head. Pours out thick. Smells hoppy. More sweet and mild than a hop bomb. Nothing bad, just not too remarkable. The aftertaste is a lot like semisweet or bitter chocolate morsels. Up front it is a lot fruitier and hoppy. It would be nicer if the chocolate could come out more at the front. Thick and like a stout should be. I could drink this fine, and it's not a bad beer. Maybe it's just how I feel right now, but I would prefer a lot of beers to this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,wolffman17,4.5,"Chocolate Stout pours pitch black. The big dark brown head is thick, chunky, and holds form for a couple of minutes. Not much lace remains on the glass, but that's probably more of a glassware problem than a negative of the beer. In the first whiff, I'm surprised that the hops dominate. After a few minutes the wonderful chocolate characteristics pop out. The aroma is full of dark chocolate, sweet chocolate syrup, fresh baked brownies, roasted malts, and hops. In the past, I remember it having more of a coffee characteristic. This time I can't find any coffee, and that's the only thing I think would make the aroma any better. Tastes much like it smells. Bottom line, this stuff tastes awesome. Rich, full-flavored, and balanced. Real chocolate taste; no artificial chocolate syrup flavor. With all the chocolate flavors in the forefront, it's easy to forget that it's wonderfully hopped. Smooth and creamy without being syrupy. Needless to say, I find it highly drinkable.  When I first had Rogue Chocolate Stout, it made me realize there's beer out there to be explored.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Portertime,4.5,"I work at Total Wine, Beer, Spirits and More in Fort Myers. Our beer section is considered ""the home spot."" When I started there is February of this year I noticed a full case (24 loose bottles) were on a shelf under the title ""Great Brews."" I figured we had just gotten it in. Months and months went past and not a single bottle was sold but still I thought nothing of it. Finally in late August I decided to make a move and buy the first bottle off the shelf. It turned out to be an outstanding, rich chocolate stout. I first took a few sips directly from the bottle and took in the aroma. I then poured the rest into a glass and noted any taste or smell change once it got a chance to breath. It had a slightly flat taste, probably from sitting on the shelf for so long. It was a dark cocao brown. Strong bittersweet chocolate flavor filled my mouth which reminded me of biting into a Hershey bar. I'd have it for dessert anytime.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kimcgolf,4.32,"This is one of the darkest, thickest stouts Ive had to date. This pours to an opaque, used-motor oil black, with a thick, dark tan head. The real secret to enjoying htis beer, as with many stouts, is to let it warm some. In my anticipation to try, I first smelled and tasted it right out of the refrigerator...nothing special. I then waited 20 minutes, and what a difference. Great aroma of chocolate and toffee, smelled like fresh made Turtle candy. Taste was more of the malty chocolate, but finely balanced by enough hops to not be too sweet. From the looks and smell of this thick bodied beer, I was worried about a syrupy sweet, but instead was long, smooth and just right. A very good beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DPMomutant,4.3,"Bear with me, it's been a while...  Got tonight in a 22oz bomber for $4.99  As much as I've had and enjoyed this beer it's amazing I didn't review it before when I reviewed more often, but anyway...  The pour was an extremely dark brown with a nice brown head. And when I'm drinking something called 'chocolate stout', that's exactly what I want to see. The only flaw is that it could have lasted longer.  The smell and taste are both of a good oatmeal stout infused excellently by dark chocolate. The chocolate comes first but by the end it reminds you it's a stout.  The mouthfeel didn't do as much for me. It rolls around good but a bit rough for my taste at the end. Still not bad at all.  I am reviewing this about 3/4 of the way through this bomber. I've been working on it for around an hour just enjoying it. The (heavenly) smell and flavor have maintained throughout. You're only going to want one of these, but you'll want all of it.

132,1118,TheBeerWolf,4.32,"All I have to say is wow! This stuff is as good as everyone says! Pours a deep brown almost black. Thick tan heads that sticks around for a little while. When smelling it fresh out of the bottle you definately smell the malt and subtle hints of dark chocolate. The taste it just wonderful. To me very balanced. The malt is the first thing I notice, just a small hint of alcohol then the subtle chocolate flavor. The chocolate aftertaste is nice and not overwhelming at all. The mouthfeel is not nearly as heavy as you would expect it to be by looking at it. Very good drinkability but not something that you pound 4 of unless your a gorilla or something. I usually take a while to drink my stout but as I got to the bottom of the bottle and it warmed a little the alcohol taste kind of started to take over and there was less of a chocolate taste at that point. But I pretty much enjoyed the whole bottle so no real big complaints. I think it would go great with a nice chocolate desert or it can be desert just by itself! I highly recommend this one if your a fan of stouts!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

My friend who doesnt really dig beer at all loved the smell of this one. The appearance was very nice with fluffy head and hardly any lacing.

132,1118,burnstar,4.44,"Pours opaque black with a medium/small tan head that dissipates quickly. Smells strongly just like milk chocolate with a bit of roasted malt - very unique and nice. Roasted malt flavor with a lot of chocolate, obvious and pleasant but not overpowering. Some hops are noticable in the finish and the beer finishes with a lingering roasted malt bitterness. Surprisingly this is pretty balanced. Mouthfeel is excellent- thick and creamy. Delicious but the heaviness and chocolate flavor do take a bit away from the drinkability of this brew. Awesome overall.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,SacoDeToro,4.09,"On tap at the Rogue Alehouse in San Fran.  The beer was a deep black with a minimal brown head that diminished into a brown lace that lasted through the pint.  The aroma of this beer is truly unique, expecially as it warms. I've had chocolate stouts before, but never with such a wonderful ""Hershey"" aroma, just like when you unwrap a fresh bar readying your s'mores. There are some roasty notes in the background and hints of Pacific NW hops.  The flavor of this beer is very roasty with some hints of ash. There isn't much sweet maltiness to speak of. The chocolate comes through very nicely without being overpowering. The hops are there in a good amount, but aren't too citrusy or piney, just nicely floral. The flavors are very complimentary - like a dark cup of coffee with a rich chocolate desert. Mmmm...  The mouthfeel is medium, but I wouldn't mind a little more weight here. Also, the addition of some wheat malt and/or Carapils might help add a little creaminess that this beer lacks.  Certainly the best chocolate stout I've had. Cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The only bad thing was when the beer was gone.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,MuenchenerKindl,3.58,"Poured from a bomber to a pint glass. The liquid is a dark chocolate, to dark brown with moderate carbonation. The head is a fantastic looking cocoa colored, 2 finger thick, big and puffy, layered mass of foam with a rocky crust. It really is quite a work of art.  The smell is fragrant, lots of sweet chocolate and a hint of alcohol.  The taste is where I lost it. It is big chocolate, quite smooth with a bitter after taste on the back of the tongue. Bit I just did not like it all that much. Like the Sam Adams Chocolate Bock. Maybe it is just too sweet when you add chocolate to beer. Come to think of it I do believe I have had some beers that tasted chocolaty that did not have chocolate in them. They should try to do that, But a bet it is real hard.  The mouthfeel is fine, smooth creamy, maybe a bit too small on the carbonation. This beet has plenty of bitter taste just no bitter bite.  Drinkability is just not up to standard. Next time pour me something else. MK",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Domingo,4.25,"Pours a dark black color that I've only seen in imperial stouts before. In fact, this might be even darker and more opaque than 99% of those, too. Pours easily and has a medium to average size brown head. Smell is well...chocolate. Not the ""kind of chocolate"" flavor most dark beers have, but more of a baker's chocolate or of a nice european candy bar. I'd call it REAL chocolate, which I guess it contains. Taste is very smooth and silky. It starts off tasting a little like an irish dry stout, but then the chocolate kicks in. Again, like the smell, this isn't a ""chocolate-like"" flavor but very much the real deal. At the same time, it's a darker chocolate flavor, which I really enjoy. Mouthfeel's perfect. Thin enough to drink regardless of season, but still maintains a lot of flavor that would wash away if it were too thin. I could drink several of these, although because of the flavor, it seems like some of the depth decreases a bit as you drink more. I found that chocolate overpowering the other flavors a little after about 1/2 the bottle. Still - this is a GREAT beer. By far the best chocolate brew I've had, and the price is cheaper than most of the others, too.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,hunteraw,4.28,"Split four ways, a big bottle of this disappeared pretty quickly.  Appearance: One of the darkest beers I've seen, absolutely opaque. Off-white head, good lacing.  Smell: Smells like the cocoa powder used in baking. Lots and lots of chocolate aroma, from beginning to end. Hard to pick out anything else, though.  Taste: Chocolatey and malty. As if Ovaltine had been stirred into the glass. The label cites ""natural chocolate flavoring,"" I'm curious exactly what they used. Bitterness shows up at the swallow, where it finishes dry. Surprisingly not a ""sweet"" beer, despite all the chocolate flavor.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is tame, as it should be for the style. Creamy mouthfeel, with medium body.  Drinkability: This would be a great dessert, but it worked well as a mid-afternoon snack too. Dry finish helps drinkability a lot.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Estarrio,3.45,"One of the blackest pours that I've ever seen, with a small cocoa colored head. OK retention, fancy lacings.  Big chocolate smell. Sweet malts and molasses lend to a chocolate bar wrapper aroma. Some hints of vanilla as well.  The flavor is not as sweet as the aroma would suggest. Bitter chocolate, cocoa and coffee balance with earthy oatmeal, slight dough flavors. There is a pronounced bitter finish but not overly flavorful. The taste somewhat more bland than I imagined. Much better at room temperature but still somewhat watered down tasting.  Moderate carbonation, what I might expect from an ale. Not creamy in the least.  I went back to the bottle to look for a freshness date but none was to be found. I have to wonder if this is either stale or light damaged. I honestly could not finish the entire bottle, as it simply was not appealing to me in the least. I'm going to try a another bottle from a different state and re-review if there is a significant difference. Otherwise, I'm very unimpressed by this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Greenfloyd,4.74,"What a decadent beer  In a category best served as an after dinner (or breakfast beer) stout, this is a culinary homerun. I could just as easily drink this at 9:30am Sunday morning, preparing for a Seahawk game, as I could puffing a nice Partagas Habano, after a sensational dinner with friends.  True to the American stout style, we have a deep, dark chocolate hue that gives way to a spice less (no cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, etc) oatmeal cookie/hot chocolate nose. A fairly quickly dissipating espresso head topped off this brew, adding to its decadent appearance. The flavor isnt to far from that. Mild mocha latte, sweet roasted malt, with minimal hoppy presence, lend this beer to its wonderful lingering aftertaste of dark chocolate oatmeal ( whatever that is). This beer was fairly heavy, as a good craft stout should bevelvety and rich, but not overbearing with its mouth feel, lending itself to multiple, large bottle consumption opportunities.  A great starter AND a great finisherall qualities I love in a beer. Enjoy alone, or with a nice after dinner, light to medium bodied cigar. Goes incredibly well with NY cheesecake as well.

Milk chocolate, and lots of it. Hersheys doesn't have anything on this beer. Taste has a nice bitter-sweetness about it. Initially there is a surge of sweet chocolate and malt upfront. Which then leads us into a strong sweeping coffee roasted hop bitterness. That bitterness really rounds out the beer. From midway on, the bitterness is on high-level, and really fills the Stout role.

Smells are definitely chocolate at first, some roasted burnt maltiness comes through as well, definitely a pleasant aroma.  Tastes, well like a stout, Coffee, oatmeal, malty sweet with a chocolate aftertaste. Maybe it's just me but I can't taste all that much chocolate, which I think is a good thing. It's there just not as apparent as one would think. Slight hoppyness to finish things out. This stout also doesn't sit too heavy on the stomach, which definitely earns it some points. Good medium-heavy body with good amount of carbonation.

Smell is of chocolate malt, and a little roasted malt? Perhaps. Taste is almost abundantly chocolate, although the hops do come through, albeit just enough to offset the sweet maltiness. Chocolate is strong, but not tedious, yet more than enough to please the chocoholic beer lover in me. Mouthfeel is a luxurious smooth, satin delight. Almost a romantic affair. Truly a sensual stout. Drinkability is slightly better than average, as I could maybe have a couple of these, but would need something to cut through the sweetness at some point.

Mabey some malt. First taste is only chocolate. Other tastings reveal some fruity flavors like green apples hidden wonderfully by the sweet to semi-sweet chocolate. Mouthfeel is constant all the way through this bottle and the clean feel followed by a chocolate coating of the tounge is very nice. Drinkability is determined if you love chocolate or not.

132,1118,rayjay,4.62,"Used to drink this when it was called Black Bear Stout for Japanese export (1999 or so, wish I would have saved a bottle), picked this one up from the local shop who just started carrying it.  I've always loved this beer. It is fairly hoppy (69 ibu) and it actually works great with the chocolate (yes real chocolate) and the malt. Smells like Hershey's Syrup. A great looking stout with a fluffy head but minimal lacing. Beer is pretty black, but has a definate brown in there as well.  I think this would be a great beer in a tasting for non-beer lovers, or especially non-dark-beer lovers. It could also be poured over vanilla ice cream. Not only is this the perfect dessert beer, it actually IS dessert!  Pacman yeast really works for this one, although I generally don't like that strain and it keeps me away from most Rogue's. There are only a handfull of their beers I truly enjoy these days, but when they nail one like this, it's heaven in a bottle.  I don't know why anyone would pay $15 for a crock of Impy Stout when Chocolate Stout and Shakespere Stout are available for 1/4 of the price. Cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ypsifly,4.55,On tap at Slow's in Detroit.  Black under a finger of light brown that shows good retention with shetts of lace.  Rich chocolate and roasted malt aromas. Hop dryness is in the back but not to be ignored.  Nice balance between the roasted malts and chocolate flavors. Cascade(?) hops give it a nice bitter/dryness that adds further balance to the equation. Lingering chocolate aftertaste gives it a nice dessert like finish.  Awesomely full mouth. Creamy. An excellent after dinner drink. I highly reccomend.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bruachan,4.35,"grabbed me a bomber at arrowine. i love me some rogue (like i love similies)  darker than the french soccer team. the brown head pours a finger or so, but recedes like a pre-tsunami surf (well, not really). smells like chocolate! i get the cascade in there, too, though i doubt i would have picked it out without help from the label. the chocolate masks it a little  tastes like chocolate! the super smooth mouthfeel is only punctuated by robust bitterness and carries other tasty malt flavors along with the chocolate. smooth oatiness. man, this stuff is super easy to quaff and super easy to find delicious! fantastic dessert brew. another winner from rogue  ps-the low appearance rating comes from the head's shortcomings. the head wasn't that impressive and i didn't get any lacing. i feel that anyone can make a brew a beautifully dark as this; it's the head that's more nuanced",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,johnniemarg,4.08,"22 oz bomber poured into a pint glass.  Pours as sark as used engine oil, with a dark brown dense and persistent 2-finger head.  Smell is swiss chocolate. Tons of chocolate. I can smell some bittering hops, but besides the chocolate, there is little discernable. Maybe some molasses.  The taste is just about all chocolate. There is just enough malt to balance this out. The malt is just noticeable at first before the long chocolate middle of the taste takes over, finally ending in a dry, hoppy, bitter finish. After I was ready to post this I realize that the malt becomes more prevalent as this warms, balancing the chocolate better.  The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Coats the mouth. A little pricky on the palate from the hops.  This is a good stout. I had it before and didn't like it as much. I probably had it too cold the last time. I'm sure this would go very well with most rich desserts.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,SilentSabre,4.27,"This is everything I was expecting and more. It poured a very dark, rich brown and left a thick, soapy, caramel coloured head that seems to be hanging around for sometime. Laced the edges of the glass nicely. Smells like milk chocolate. I mean, it actually smells like a chocolate Easter bunny. Amazing. Taste is good and chocolatey, as well, but there is almost a spiciness present. Like a nutmeg-cinnamon-clove kind of spiciness. Bizarre. Very much enjoyable, but bizarre, nonetheless. Has a bit of bitterness on the finish, which is a bit dry, as well. Mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth in the mouth with little or no carbonation sting. This is a fabulous stout. I'm glad I took the time to try it out.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,wingman14,4.6,"This one pours a black with a tan head that sticks around for awhile. You can pour this one so the head stays with you for the entire beer, I find that this gives a nice aroma to the glass. The smell is of pure chocolate, sweet and inviting. It is like melted chocolate in a glass. The taste is similar, very sweet, straight chocolate, even with the heavy chocolate taste this beer is balanced so you do not get sick of it by the last sip. The mouthfeel is great, smooth and rich. I always find that I could have a couple more after the first. Every time I have had this beer it has always impressed me. An excellent brew that everyone should check out. Enjoy!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,MiScusi,4.79,"This beer blew me away from what I was expecting, namely after having had the Young's Double Chocolate Stout.  This was a totally different kind of beer than Young's. The smell is of sweet powdery chocolate. The taste is of liquified sweet chocolate. IBU's register at 69 but this thing actually felt like maybe 10, this one is pretty mellow. This would be the beer I'd put a scoop of ice cream in if I ever wanted a beer float.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mstudley,3.98,"A: Looks like liquified chocolate cake. Thick pour, deep black in color with minimal head. Poured from 22oz bottle at room temperature.  S: I think I took more time smelling this brew than drinking it. Fantastic bitter chocolate aromas mixed with strong coffee scents and roasted malt. Just great.  T: Again, great. Bitter chocolate (like baking chocolate) truffles, coffee. More sweet than bitter overall. I think I need another for more research :)  M: Only area that came up a little short for me. I expected a much thicker, creamier feel to compliment the taste. Not bad at all but should be richer.  D: One did it for me. Would be great after dinner to finish things off.

132,1118,Noxious26,4.63,"650ml bottle poured in a pint glass. Part of a Father's Day gift from my parents. Thanks Mom and Dad!  Black, opaque with just a hint of cola colour around the edges as held to the light. Prodigous light brown foamy head is over an inch high on the pour. Great head retention as it's still around 1/4 inch half way down the glass. Looks like a piece of sponge cake on top of a glass of motor oil. Impressive lacing down the glass.  Aroma is sweet and bitter. Burnt sugar, bitter chocolate, roasted malt, and a hint of coffee that is more reminiscent of a cafe mocha. Very enticing.  Rich full stout flavours are complemented by creamy chocolate. Bitter chocolate, burnt sugar and roasted malt off the start. Then it actually seems a bit sweeter in the middle as it's more of a smooth, sweet, creamy chocolate for a second, then it's gone and replaced by coffee, burnt, roast malt and even a bit of a herbally hop undertone. Finish is classic stout: bitter roasted malt, burnt sugar and coffee with a hint of sweetness. Aftertaste is bitter burnt and roasted malt.  Rich, full mouthfeel. Smooth and creamy, yet thick and full. Light pin pricks of carbonation touch the tongue ever so briefly.  This is a tremendous stout. I know some people aren't big on chocolate or coffee stouts, but to heck with them. This is great. I really like how the bittersweet chocolate adds another dimension to what seems like it would be a world-class stout underneath. Definitely an easy going sipping brew. Another classic by Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A: Opaque ebony with a carmel colored resilient head, with nice persistent lacing S: Unsweet chocolate dominates anything else T: Chocolate malted oats with the slightest hint of very mild hops M: Liquid toffee D: Too bold for a session with anything more than a 22 oz bomber.

132,1118,JBStith,3.73,"Rogue Chocolate Stout in a 22 oz bomber...  I had this beer many years ago in the Rogue brewpub in Newport. At the time, I thought it was wonderful. It is still a ""good"" beer, but I guess my palate has evolved over time. Anyhow, here it is  A: Pours hazy and dark brown, the color of dark chocolate. Good tan head with descent retention and lacing.  S: Initial smell is of sweet malt and rosted coco or chocolate. No sign of hops or spice, which is good for this style.  T: Follows smell. A distict taste of coco and chocolate. Again, not much bitterness at all. A bit lacking in malt backbone.  M&D: Mouthfeel is a bit thin. I was expecting a heavier, sweeter stout to compliment the chocolate. I feel this beer should coat the mouth and it doesn't. Drinkability is descent, but not great.  Overall, my impressions of this beer changed significantly over time. this beer doesn't impress me as much as it did many years ago.

Extremely dark, basically black, liquid topped with a large chocolate milk colored head. Thick creamy foam that shrinks but doesn't disappear and leaves a thin lace trail. The aroma is just what I was looking for: chocolate. Dark chocolatey maltiness, and bitter bakers chocolate smells rise out of the glass. The taste is full of flavor, chocolatey cocoa, maltiness, and enough bitter kick to keep it from being to sweet. Also can sense some caramel and vanilla flavors. The added oatmeal make it full bodied and smooth. Finish is a bit dry, not sticky or oily, with a touch of bitter chocolate. I could sip this from my snifter all night.  Ranked the #4 American Stout when I tried it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Wow. Mouthfeel is dense and thick, with a noticeable amount of carbonation making it's way to the tongue. Drinkability is pretty good.

132,1118,InsolublePancake,4.22,"A- Pretty much black, I don't see much light getting through this one. Big tan head with a nice lacing. Looks like a stout should look.  S- Rich chocolate and coffee aromas, smells like a cafe mocha from Starbucks (or wherever). As the beer warms the chocolate aroma becomes more pronounced and takes on more of a Hershey's syrup smell. Roasted malt is always there in the background to remind you that this is, indeed, a beer.  T- Chocolate and coffee flavors abound. Espresso and baker's chocolate are the highlights with a burnt toast flavor in the finish. Surprisingly little sweetness, as the aroma indicated that this would be a fairly sweet beer. Finishes dry and fairly bitter with a lingering mocha aftertaste.  M- Smooth and velvety, very nice.  D- This beer isn't extremely alcoholic, but it does pack a bit of a punch at 6%. It's also very rich and filling, so I really wouldn't want to have more than one. One of these as a dessert beer is all I want.  Very good beer, I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's worth buying this beer for the smell alone. Great for dessert. I'm not even a huge stout fan and I loved this beer. Highly recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Nice lacing, destipe the plastic cup Cocoa aroma. Tastes like a good, hoppy stout, mixed with dark chocolate. Feels like a chocolate soda at times. Eatly on, the carbonation was felt as it went down. As the beer warmed, it became much smoother. Drinkability was ok, got better as the night went on.  Eighty-five degrees with high humidity was not the place for this beer.

T - bitter chocolate and roasted malt. Chocolate stands out more in this one than any chocolate stout I've tried.  M - very creamy on the tongue. Smooth.  D - easy to drink. could easily have a few of these in one sitting.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Powerful smell of chocolate and roasted grains. Taste is fairly sweet chocolate with an oaty, bready touch. This beer is surprisingly bitter. It's not unwelcome because of the sweet chocolate, but it's unexpected. Minimal carbonation, but it is a stout, after all. Very smooth mouthfeel.  This stuff is so sweet, but I did drink a whole 22 oz. bottle without trouble. I'll probably pick up another one of these days.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

If you let the beer sit on your tounge for a moment it becomes velvety smooth and soooo creamy.

132,1118,cjgator3,4.4,Pours a dark pitch black with a nice creamy 2 finger tan colored head. Aroma is sweet milk chocolate and a slight hop bitterness. Taste is creamy chocolate up front with notes of coffee and hops finishing up the taste. The bitterness from the hops may be a bit too strong for this particular brew but they do help clean the palate of the sweetness preparing you for the next sip.

Chocolate becomes more pronounced as the beer warms.  Definite cocoa and bittersweet chocolate flavors. French roast coffee. Strong bitterness becomes less apparent as the beer warms.  Fairly thick and chewy mouthfeel. Strong bitter aftertaste. Very thick bodied beer, especially for one that is relatively low in ABV versus it's Imperial Stout big brothers.  Overall a pretty good beer. The lower ABV would let you drink more of these than you could an Imperial stout, yet I find the flavor of this beer equals that of a RIS. Nice example of the style.

Poured into a Sammy Smith pint, came out jet black with a magnificent 2 finger slightly chocolate tinged head. The smell of this beer hit me harder than any other before. Chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate. Hints of toffee, vanilla, coffee and a touch of alcohol coming through. It only got better as it warmed.  Taste first off had all the smells coming through with a good kick of alcohol, which dissapated as I drank on and the beer warmed. A later taste of perhaps black licorice came through.  As for Drinkability, it is awesome, all I needed was a scoop of vanilla icecream thrown in. Highly recommend this beer, as well as any other Rouge. Still have not been dissapointed by any Rouge beer.  Cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Kendo,4.45,"Got a couple on tap at Lionheart in Albany last night.  Pours black with a short, milkshake-colored tan head that disappeared relatively quickly, leaving not much lacing, but a pretty solid ring around the glass.  Scent: The immediate onslaught is chocolate. Reminds me of hot cocoa mix. As I inhale more deeply, however, I discern the malt underneath. But as expected, the chocolate dominates.  As for taste: once again the chocolate dominates, especially at the start of each sip. As it coats the mouth, however, there is a sense of roasted malt, a tad bit of coffee flavor, and a very slight bitter finish lingers on the back of the tongue, reminding me once again more of dark chocolate bitter than a typical beer's hoppy bitterness. Given the chocolate scent and the initial flavor, its surprisingly dry rather than sweet.  As for mouthfeel: moderately carbonated. Not as heavy on the feel as you might expect from the color and scent, but also not as creamy as I thought it would be.  Drinkability? I liked it so much I had another. For a full-flavored stout, I found it quite drinkable, and the 6% ABV won't hit you as hard as, say, an Imperial Stout. But if youre not into chocolate-flavored beer, you may consider this to be a one and done dessert-type beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,zjungleist,3.9,"Appears near pitch black with a fair tan head. Smells great, mainly and very strongly of dark chocolate. The taste is heavy with roasted grains and a distinct chocolate aftertaste. After a few drinks the chocolate aftertaste became less pronounced and was slightly more bitter, though I would not have described the first few sips as sweet. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy on the bubbles, and I would say it was a little too much for a stout, but there was some creaminess. Overall I did enjoy this beer a lot, but when I'm in the mood for a beer like this, I usually go for something a bit stronger and more complex.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,veggiemafia,4.37,"22oz. bomber served in a nonic.  Pours very black with almost no transluscence and a mocha/tan head that dissolves to a ring and patchy lace. Visible sediment on the bottom of my glass, don't know what's up with that.  Smell is to freakin' die for. Chocolate dominates with notes of coffee and dark fruits to back it up. Minimal hop presence in the smell, but it's there.  Taste is similar but the impact of the chocolate is lessened and there's a distinct grainy character that really keeps this one from being overly sweet. Hops are a pleasant earthy backbone, still quite fruity, too.  Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but definitely leaves a sticky feeling in your mouth.  I could put this one away for the rest of the evening.  I really want to try this with some ice cream and maybe fresh berries.

132,1118,Cwrw,3.85,"This is my first chance to try the Chocolate Stout from Rogue, and if reviews mean anything, this should be a fine stout indeed. 650ml bottle with the embossed Rogue label. What I love about the Rogue bottles is their listing of the actual hops and malts used in the beer--something I have yet to see on any bottle here in Canada. Nice to have the IBU and Plato listed as well. Big whiff of chocolate as soon as I popped the cap. This, like their Mocha Porter, is extremely dark and opaque with hints of dark blue near the edges. The head is large and mocha-coloured, with little dimples of deeper brown/near red. Good tight foam and full sheets of lacing that leave rings on the glass. A fantastic looking stout. The aroma is make-no-mistake chocolate. Nesquick, raisins, and cafe mocha. A syrupy aroma floats around too, akin to tree sap or maple. The hops are really hard to smell, because this is all about the dark cocoa man--in fact, whilst the aroma is appetising, it is uncomplex. Perhaps some hazelnut, a little toffee/caramel, light licorice. Brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate bars....etc. Anything chocolate really. To its credit it smells like fresh, real chocolate and not some stale extract. The beer warms a little and some creamy lactose comes into play as well, complementing the malts. A really lovely malty aroma all in all. Soft and sweet. Cocoa and mocha on the tongue at first, with soft hints of dusty chocolate on the middle and a fairly bitter finish where the hops add their oiliness and a little grassy citrus. The bitterness is actually quite high after a few sips. Tasty malts, with some oat fulness. Licorice, chocolate raisins, and very grainy and dusty malting in the aftertaste. Still, the flavour is not quite as full or as chocolate-filled as I expected. The body feels a little weak--perhaps less smooth than I should like for a chocolate stout. Lingering taste though, with a wonderful roasty dryness. This was very good, but not outstanding. Personally I don't see why it rates so high. A definite case of ""not-living-up-to-the-hype.""",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Subtle roasted malt aroma as well.  Taste  The taste is dominated by the chocolate which I was expecting judging from the smell. the chocolate taste either grew on me or that particular aspect mellowed out a bit as the beer warmed. There was enough bitterness in there to tame the sweetness I was expecting, which was nice.  Mouthfeel  Thick chewy body, very nice for this style of stout.  Drinkability  Surprisingly easy to drink.

The taste is roasty bitterness up front that gives way to clear as a bell chocolate, slightly bittersweet bakers chocolate, but with a touch of milk chocolate sweetness. There is a creamy creaminess present as well. The roast chocolate notes linger in the mouth. Full bodied and also surprisingly light, with almost no carbonation, but this works.

132,1118,elricorico,3.85,"Pours nearly black and forms a large light brown head. Looks very nice.  The smell is rich dark chocolate, and somewhere underneath roasted malt tries to make itself known. Loving the dark chocolate part, and when the smell balances it is still very nice.  Taste is a little more stout than chocolate. Roasted malt becomes stronger, and the chocolate part of the taste feels a little thin. The finish has a bit of dryness, and more roasted flavour lingers than anything. I was hoping for a more chocolate flavours.  Mouthfeel is good, though I would say that it could use just a touch more weight. Carbonation is light, as expected with the style.  I must say that this is the Rogue brew that I wanted to try the most. I can't say that it is a bad beer, but I am a little disappointed. I was hoping for something closer to Young's Double Chocolate Stout, as that is one of my personal favorites. A good stout, but the chocolate is drowned out by the strong stout qualities.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Orrshow,4.65,"Appearance  Black and non see through. The head is a nice dark tan and leaves lacing all over.  Smell  So full of chocolate its crazy and Im reminded of some sort of nutty truffle. The smell is quite sweet and I sense some hops as well. Very nice.  Taste  Same as it smells. Dominated by chocolate with an almost earthy sensation. There is roasted malt present, bitter hops, and a hint of what strikes me as cherrybut its extremely subtle.  Mouthfeel  Thick thick thick. Love it. Toned down carbonation. So nice. Wow. Pefect.  Drinkability  I can down like no other, but I prefer to sip it. No complaints.  Damn good beer. I love it. I need more",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,EvilKeith,4.03,"Pours a dark, dark brown. In the glass it could easily be mistaken for being black in color. Light is not capable of passing through this one. The head is mocha in color and would look right at home on a rootbeer float. The lace hangs in sheets.  Smell is unsweetened cocoa, dark roasted malts with smoky and toasted notes.  Taste is all about the chocolate. Not sweet, more of a dry cocoa flavor. Cocoa flavored aftertaste, not unpleasant.  Full bodied, potentially a meal all by itself. Creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is rather subdued.  I have tried other chocolate stouts, to date none have been in the same league as this one by Rogue. Well done!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jettjon,4.28,"Highs: Taste, oh my God! Lows: None  Pours a brown/black opaque with a solid one-finger head of brown, creamy, various-sized bubbles. Head fades away at a steady pace, leaving a light lacing. Nose is malt, sweet hops, and a strong presence of milk chocolate. Taste HOLY CRAP, its chocolate milk! Serious milk chocolate action here. If this is your thing, read no further; run, dont walk to your nearest beer specialty store and buy some of this marvelous elixir. Fortunately (?) the milk chocolate, in-your-face flavor fades upon subsequent quaffs; it could become overpowering. Theres also a heavy malt presence and some sorghum evident. Mouth is a bit watery for a porter, but is refreshing and bubbly. Finish is sweet hops to a dry bitter close; excellent if you enjoy this style. Drinkability is good, easy to kick back several.  Overall: Wow, a kickass porter. I think Im in love.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bennetj17,3.7,"Dark black pour leaves tan crust of foam. Aroma is distinctively sweet and of chocolate cake. The taste is not as sweet perhaps, it has a bit of mocha flavor with a hint of smoke, and a moderately bitter finish that has a sour after taste. Mouthfeel is quite thick, with decent carbonation. Drinkabilty is good, not overly alcoholic, but the chocolate flavor seemed a bit contrived as they added flavoring. I would have expected a bit more sweetness to balance out the taste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,trouserbat,3.55,"Appearance: Deepest black, with noticable bubbles and a thin but persistent, lusciously brown head.  Smell: Dark and heavy malt, chocolate. Not a significant amount of hops, ""just"" dark chocolate.  Taste: The chocolate dominates everything else. There's some maltiness, certainly, and while there are certainly some bittering hops (69 IBU worth, according to the bottle), I don't taste much hop flavor in the citrusy / piney register. The malt and hops support the chocolate, rather than complement it. Other reviews mention some spices (especially comparing it to Mexican drinking chocolate), but I don't taste them.  Mouthfeel: Thick, but not smotheringly malty. Rather drinkable, actually, a bit thick but not satiating.  Overall: Definately worth trying. The chocolate flavor is good, though it did come off a little one-dimensional. Nonetheless, highly drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Beergeeknut,4.43,Appearance: Pours jet black with a very foamy head about two fingers thick and mocha in color.  Aromas: Mocha notes lots of chocolate.  Taste: Chocolate and more chocolate great mocha notes with burnt hop notes and very malty rather rich. A very smooth mouthfeel.  Notes: This one is aboslutely great a chocolate lovers dream beer foam lines the glass from begining to end a winner from Rogue. Cheers!,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bignick,4.23,"On tap at TPH 4/14/06 for $5. Served in a pint glass.  This is a chocolate lover's chocolate stout. It is a beautiful beer: black with a creamy, slightly brown head that just invited the lucky drinker to imbibe. The taste is sweet for a beer, with an overwhelming chocolate taste. It is almost like drinking dark chocolate, with a nice hop undertone playing with the semi-sweet roastiness of the malt. A little slow going down due to its body, this is a very nice offering from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,nflmvp,3.53,"Sampled on 4/13/06 from a 22 ounce bottle.  Poured near black with a two inch mocha head. Smell is chocolate, chocolate, chocolate and even more chocolate. Oddly enough, taste is chocolate too...both sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel is thick and coating. Drinkability is pretty good.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,wbc,4.27,"This is a rich malty sweet beauty with a creamy off white head and thick lacing. The color is completely opaque. The aromas of chocolate and mocha are completely apparent from the opening of the bottle, there are more subtle notes of toasty or roasted grain but not overpowering. I think Rogue has once again proven to me that they can brew whatever they want and succeed. I could drink this beer for dessert any day of the week.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Zorro,4.5,"Pours a coal black beer with a tall brown head.  Smell is slightly sweet and fairly hoppy for a chocolate stout. Once you get past the hops the chocolate and vanilla aromas really come out and massage your nose. But there are more aromas; this is unexpectedly spicy with a good cinnamon and slight chili pepper aroma like Mexican chocolate. There also seems to be some allspice and ginger in the scent as well.  Taste is semi dry and spicy at the beginning with a strong cinnamon and ginger flavor. Chocolate kicks in more after a few more sips, but the spices never quite disappear from the taste and adds that extra kick that Mexican chocolate and coffee has. This is a stout that never gets bitter and stays semi dry in your mouth a most superior stout.  Mouthfeel is thick.  I really want to hate this beer because of who makes it, but I can't do that this is really a great beer. Creamy and tasty this is quite good, and somewhat expensive at $7 a bottle. If you are holding out on trying this just because of who makes it then stop and give it a chance. I would possibly question the Style classification, as this is most certainly a heavily spiced beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,boulevard2,2.7,22 oz bomber  Pours a thick ceamy head and then disapates quickly. This beer is heavily carbonated with a strong scent of chocolate and malt. Not as strong or smooth as I hoped considering Shakespear's taste. I even tried to pare with chocolate and found it very dissapointing. This beer had no substance to it and left me hanging! Hope next years batch is better!,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mcallister,3.5,"A used motor oil brown pour, with very little head present and no lacing. Overly roasted choclate malts, oats, malt ball, cream and sweet vanilla abstract and used coffe grounds make up the aroma.  The mouth of this beer is very austere to me. There are some sharp edges I think need straightening but I feel this way about all of Rouges darker brews. Almost like a low end mocha latte. And I say low end because of the coffee taste, which reminds me of either used rinds or a cheap folgers or maxwell house type blend. Overly choclate hops and oaty flavors and very unsweetened. Roasted malts, cream, cassis, and a slight background hop, and maybe some burnt marshmallow.  This beer leaves a very tannic mouthfeel with a long choclate finish. Too choaclaty for my liking; making this a one beer and done for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Roguester,4.2,"Smells faintly of chocolate, and pours a very dark brown with milky brownish head. Initial taste is a bit harsh, complex combination of quite bitter chocolate and hops. Following the beer is a great mouthfeel, something like chocolate cake. Perfect drink for after dinner with a desert, or as a desert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,scottoale,3.85,"From a 650ml brown, silkscreen labeled bomber pours an opaque black-brown liquid that does not let light through, it looks like liquid Vegemite. An overly aggresive pour got me a three-finger, cocoa brown frothy head. Plenty of lacing with this one.  First sniff reveals dart bitter chocolate roasted to burnt malts and a very strange hop twang that hard to put a finger on. I am guessing this is not normal for this brew, the best way I can describe it is vinegar and kind of tincture of benzoin...really weird. I will review this beer again soon, as I think this is not a good bottle. I will do my best to continue, putting aside the strange, off-flavor.  Main taste with the first quaff is of bitter chocolate, dark french roast coffee and a strong Cascade hop bittering finish. Very rich and roasty. It starts with just a bit of sweetness then quickly turns bitter and dry with a nice, chocolaty aftertaste that hangs on.  Mouthfeel is lively and cream-like, medium heavy in body and moderately strong, I'd recommend this as an after dinner beer or night capper...cheers.  Note: the ratings I gave reflect what I think the beer deserves and I will review it again soon and adjust as I see fit, thanks. S.O.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jhollick,4.77,"Presentation - 22 oz. bomber bottle. Poured shiny black with a dark tan head. Excellent lacing, but that's nothing new for Rogue.  Smell - Sweet cocoa and dark chocolate are predominant. Oats enhance the rich sweetness of the smell  Mouthfeel - Heavy. Thick. Smooth. Very nice. Enough said.  Taste - The smell belies the taste of this beer. I was expecting sweetness along the lines of Young's Double Chocolate, but that isn't the case. The taste is sweet at first, but the dark, more bitter chocolates soon take over. Not that its a bad thing in any way. Coffee and hints of berry can be found. The hop presence is perfectly masked until the finish. Surprisingly dry and hoppy at the end, but that provides an excellent contrast to the sweeter and earthier flavors found towards the beginning. Taaaayyysty!  Drinkability - Strictly a one per night brew at the bomber size. Nevertheless, thoroughly drinkable throughout the bottle. The flavors never wear on you, and alcohol level is reasonably low.  Overall - The word of mouth has been spreading, and with good reason. This beer kicks ass. It takes a backseat to no chocolate stout (I'm looking at you, Brooklyn - you have been matched). The 22 oz. size gives you plenty of time to savor all this beer has to offer. I'm glad I bought two instead of just one! Rogue, why must you be all the way on the west coast???",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,custardcb,3.97,"Big'ol 22oz bottle poured into my pint glass. Jet black color with a rich brown head that is rich and abundant. Has rooms of rich cocoa and toffee. The roasted malts jump out with coffee, toffee, and vanilla scents.  The first taste is so rich and almost overwhelming. Dark bitter chocolate is the most predominate flavor with espresso lingering in the background. It has a certain dryness to it and isnt sweet by anymeans. As you keep drinking the taste only amplifies in you mouth.  I couldn't do a session of this by any means but paired with the right dessert it would be fantastic. A very high quality brew that I look foreward to using in my cooking.  As much as I like this beer though I've opened two 22oz bottles on seperate occasions and couldnt finish either of them. Afterwhile it just gets to be too much for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,VoodooBrew,4.5,"All right all right, I guess I'll go ahead and see what all the hype is about over this beer.  Pours quite dark-- just about opaque. Big dark tan head leaves nice tracings on the glass. It took me a while to begin drinking this beer because I was having so much fun just smelling it! Rich milk chocolate, faint pipe tobacco, all wrapped up in a general candy aroma-- smells like chocolate eggs with the hard candy shell... smells like Easter! More goodness on the palate: surprisingly airy and floral, followed by a candy sweetness, chocolate, tobacco, then a sturdy roasted bitterness in the finish. Whereas the aroma seems to be all milk chocolate, the flavor takes on more of a dark chocolate/cocoa profile, along with dark fruits as are often found in dark chocolate-- in this case, dark cherries, perhaps. Whereas this baby is loaded with flavor, the palate remains by and large unsmothered, and as such you may be tempted to gulp this brew right down. But don't-- there's too much complexity and too many rewards in here to rush through. Bravo Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,tgbljb,4.67,"Poured a very deep brown color with massive tannish head. Left nice lacing on the side of the glass. Taste is loaded with toasted malt but the dark chocolate is also present in large quantities. Taste is sensational with the sweet choclate tastes combining with the roasted malt to form an astonishins delicious taste sensation. Finishes with a slight bitterness, but the sweetness of the chocolate overwelms it. An excellent, well-made beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BlueHammer,4.82,"This is easily one of my favorite beers ever. I first tried it a while ago, before I understood much about beer and was skeptical of the idea of ""chocolate-flavored beer""... How naive I was...  I've had it many times since then and it remains my favorite chocolate stout. The chocolate flavor is powerful, yet not overpowering - I like that.  It pours almost black with a fairly thick tan-colored head. It smells like a chocolate bar - and shouldn't it? It is sweet and malty but balanced, making it easy to drink. This beer serves as an excellent ""dessert"" drink. It was great to sip after dinner, though it goes down so smoothly, if felt as if I'd barely started it before it was gone. It feels as if it starts at the tip of your tongue and just rolls comfortably back down your throat!  I recommend it and I will be definitely be having it again!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,skillerified,4.33,"Pours pitch black. I excpected a little color, but this was pleasantly surprising. Huge and puffy chocolate colored head. Good lacing.  The nose is dominated by a deliciously sweet smelling chocolate candy scent. Maybe a little sweet malt, but there's not much beyond the chocolate smell. Not that I'm complaining. It smells fantastic.  The flavor is a mix of sweet malt and a delicious, light chocolate cake. There is a slight hop bite on the finish that nicely contrasts with the early sweetness. A good mix of flavors here. I'm expecting it to get a little richer as it warms.  Rich and creamy with just a little carbonation bite. Sweet, but not too sweet. Excellent balance for the style.  There is no reason not to have another. An excellent brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,normZurawski,3.7,"This is a good beer, but I think it takes the word chocolate to an extreme. It's got the same sort of flavor Hershey's syrup has - rich and slightly bitter. It's good for one glass, but I don't forsee myself buying this again. Don't get me wrong, it's enjoyable. But it's not your typical beer. At least it doesn't really come off as something I'll ever say I have a yearning for.  The beer pours dark & rich, as you might expect. Little to no head to speak of. Decent aroma with the foreshadowing of chocolate syrup to follow. Decent but thin mouthfeel, with an abundance of chocolate overtones and a malty body. Everything about this is hinted with that chocolate syrup taste - overtones, body, nose, finish, aftertaste. You name it, it's there. After I finished the glass and licked my fingers, it tasted like chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,NolanGTI,4.95,"Yep, this may be one of my highest rated beers according to style right now. In effect, this beer is the wonderful Shakespear stout with additional chocolate mixed in. I have gone through a case of bombers this winter and could not have been more pleased.  Color- wonderful rich blackness with a nice brown 1 fingerred head Taste - literally Shakespear witht he chocolate turned up Smell - did I mention the chocolate, purely seductive with hints of roasted malt and coffee  This could easily be a gateway beer for chocolate lovers. A truly wonderful stout that is just beautifully crafted and will consistently bring a smile to your face with each sip.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Drew966,4.08,"This beer pours an opaque black with a thick tan head from a 22 ounce brown bottle. Malt and a hint of chocolate in the nose. Tastes like a dark chocolate bar.

132,1118,taez555,3.61,"Poured a pitch black body with a thick brownish/tan head.  Nose was a mix of milk chocolate, coffee, toffee, fruits with an overall natural root sort of smell. Almost has a root-beer float sort of smell more than a chocolate smell.  Dark burnt malt taste. Medium bodied and surprisingly smooth. Dark Dark Dark chocolate, coffee, coffee beans, espresso beans, licorice, vanilla beans. Again, I""m thinking more root beer float. Tastes sort of like chomping on chocolate barley malt more than a hershey milk chocolate bar. Very present bItterness that brings itself forward even more as it fades in the end, although it's probably more of a burnt malt bitterness than hop.  I like the concept of a chocolate stout, but I found it to be more of a super dark chocolate malt taste than candy bar sort of chocolate. It's good, but I just didn't think it was well balanced.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

T - Smooth subtle chocolate flavor. Roasted malt. Lots of vanilla flavor. Coffee with cream. Nice lingering hop presence in the finish. Tastes more and more like a chocolate malt as the beer warms.  M - Thin to medium bodied. I expected it to be a little more full in the mouthfeel department. Mid level carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink.  D - Good drinkability. Very enjoyable as a nightcap.

The aroma is all about chocolate; there's modest amounts of roasted coffee and malt smells, and a slight citric hoppiness.  The taste of this beer is, like the smell, completely dominated by a dark chocolate sweetness, with hints of roasted coffee and a citrus bitterness. The mouthfeel is full, thick and creamy; finishes slightly dry with an aftertaste that is a blend of chocolate, coffee, and hops.  A very good beer, but almost a bit too intense on its own.

Smell is laced with thick, sweet chocolate, and has a slightly burnt overtone. The smell just gets stronger and sweeter as the beer warms, until it is like a freshly unwrapped chocolate bar. The taste is of dark, roasted malts with plenty of chocolate coming through. Again, the chocolate becomes more palpable as the beer warms up. Mouthfeel is a touch thin, but still has enough body to satisfy, and the drinkability is remarkable for a stout. This goes down easier than the macro lager I was given at a party last night. Nearly perfect, this is destined to be an all-time favourite.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Taste is similar to the aroma. A little more sweet and burnt malts come out in the flavor over just chocolate. Wonderfully creamy mouthfeel. Burnt grains linger into the aftertaste.  Very nice. Not something to drink more than one of, but would be great to go along with desert or as desert itself.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Kind of dark chocolate, but also some baking chocolate and maybe some chocolate syrup. Roasted malt/coffee background. Nice. Lightly sweet chocolate. Gives way to drier baking chocolate/cocoa powder. Roasted barley gives a nice bitterness, before rich, chocolate mousse takes over the long finish. This is chocolate beer. Medium-bodied. Not syrupy; in fact, almost dry. Ample carbonation.

Some instant cocoa aroma with a little dairy, and dark malt. Mainly choclate though.  Taste is a hearty ,creamy blend of oats and dark malt for a second , then nothing but dark chocolate goodness.

First smell of this beer is a big dissapointment for me. Smell like artificial chocolate, sweet and fake. Like taking a big whiff of a hershey's chocolate sauce knock off. Definitely chocolately, but fake, artificial, and cheap.  Luckily, the flavor completely makes up for the aroma. Upon sipping this beers you are treated to a nice roasted flavor, accompanied by a bold bitter chocolate flavor. I personally love dark chocolate (won't touch the milk stuff), and this beer does not dissapoint me there. After smelling it, I thought this would be undrinkable. However, the flavor is fantastic, dark, bitter, chocolate. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, most likely due to the oats used in brewing it.  Drinkability also ranks high, due to low alcohol and smooth, well blended flavors.

Small dark-mocha head that fades fast. Pitch black motor-oil like colour.  Smells like... duh... chocolate. Milk chocolate, or chocolate milk, to be precise. A bit of hop kick in there, surprisingly, but mainly malty. Reminds me primarily of fresh pastries or croissants, like the pain du chocolat I had for breakfast this morning. Mmm.  Tastes great, although you can tell the chocolate is an additive. I think I like the beers that come by the chocolate flavours naturally better. Milky notes. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for the style and appearance, and the only moderately disappointing aspect of this brew. Slightly sour aftertaste.  An interesting idea with this beer is to have it with some very bitter chocolate.

There is an underlying and unexpected bitterness -- perceived most strongly in the finish and aftertaste -- that pervades the roasted coffee malt flavors and chocolate sweetness. I want to say this peculiar bitterness comes from the cocoa, but subsequent burps yield a distinct Cascade flavor. Amazing complexity of tastes acheived here. Silky smooth mouthfeel; medium to full body. Not something I'd go for very frequently, mainly because of the special chocolate flavor that is the main event of this beer, but nevertheless, an formidable and worthy accomplishment by the geniuses at Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The distinct citric-floral scent of Cascade hops is also detectable.  Taste: Quite bitter, and exquisitely chocolatey, especially in the finish. Hops keep the otherwise weighty beer buoyant. An excellent, thick, earthy dessert stout, almost venturing into RIS territory.  Mouthfeel: Nice and creamy, and slightly grainy from the oats. Slightly syrupy on the back of the tongue and palate.

I think this is very well balanced. A little hint of hops at the finish.  Mouthfeel: Light carbonation with a semi-sweet chocolate taste that coats the tongue and fades to a pleasant bitterness.  Drinkability: I really enjoyed this stout. I do not have access to many chocolate stouts in my area but I think this Rogue is great. I will definately buy this one again and again and again. I will probably enjoy this after a meal since I like sweets after I eat. I can kill two birds with one stone. An after dinner beer and sweet desert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,supernaut,4.32,"I've had this beer quite a few times, yet never reviewed it despite slamming the label design in the forum, so with a bottle in my hand...here goes....  Pours out very well. 2 finger head and lacing to match. Right away you're blown away by the chocolate. One whiff, and you get the feeling you're about to drink a candy bar. The taste is much of same. Very chocolatey throughout. Some evidence of burnt malt and mild coffee undertones. A hint of dark fruit sweetness, again buried by the chocolate. The finish is very smooth as well. Coats the tongue for a moment, and then fades. High drinkability. Could go well before or after dinner. Would also suggest adhering to the serving temp recommendations. I've had them a bit colder and warmer, and this beer (like many) brings out the goodness when served a bit on the warm side. Definitely recommended, bad artwork aside.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Optimat0r,4.55,"appearance - very dark, as expected, looks like liquid chocolate.  smell - i dont usually bother with this category but this is the best smelling beer ive had. smells almost like hot chocolate  taste - very solid. similar to the shakespeare stout except less hop presence and with prominent chocolate flavors. very deep. slight hint of coffee, but this one truely lives up to its name and is an extremely good example of a chocolate stout.  drinkability - good but after a while the sweet flavors get to be too much. would be great on tap in a single serving, or splitting the 220z with a friend. if u like chocolate stouts this is a must. everyone should try this one at least once.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,danielharper,4.28,"Purchased from Frugal MacDougal, Nashville, TN.  I reviewed this once before on-tap, from memory, upon first trying it. This is a second review, taken with much more beer knowledge and with peace and quiet at home with a bottle. My opinion has changed slightly, and I taste things now that I didn't taste before, but largely I think I'm about even with myself.  A: Dark body, thick foamy tan head. Head seems to float on top of the beer like a chocolate malted, and leaves significant lacing on the glass.  S: Strong on hop presence, with dry roasty malt underneath, and an enveloping layer of chocolate. (This is the largest difference between my two reviews -- on-tap all I got on the nose was, ""smells like the best mocha latte you've ever had"", but experience has given me greater olfactory tools.)  T: Strong hop presence in flavor, nice velvety bittersweet cholcate afterwards. Lightly bitter and slightly astringent aftertaste.  M: Thick mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, about right for a stout.  D: Could down several of these -- a bomber goes down smooth.  Overall, I love this beer and buy it every chance I get. Is it better on-tap or from the bottle? Hmm, gonna need some more experimentation to find out.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ashleyshalyn,4.15,"On-tap in a pint glass  A: Dark Brown black with a creamy coffee colored 2 finger head with great retention.  S: Deep chocolate and coffee malt. A bit of hop is noticeable as well in the background.  T: Low on the hop and high on bittersweet chocolate! Also the coffee taste is much more evident on tap than in the bottle, which surprised me. DO not expect a sweet chocolate with this! In fact, the first time I had this we ate 70% cocoa chocolates along with it and MAN did it really bring that flavor out in the beer simply amazing!  M: Chewy with low carbonation, but it isnt too too heavy.  D: A personal favorite I could drink this every day if it wouldnt make me gain 5 billion pounds!  Cheers to Rogue! This is a fabulous beer on-tap and out of the bottle... I have had both, but this review is for the tap. I'll get around to writing a bottle review when I drink it next time ;) I cant wait to try a black and tan made with Rogue Choc Stout and Rogue Juniper Pale Ale.

132,1118,Prufrock,3.92,"22 oz. bottle poured into a pilsner.  pitch brown with an inch of brownish head. head falls into lumps leaving rings of lacing. nice-looking beer.  aroma is chocolate, chocolate, and chocolate. a whiff of coffee as well. the hops push through with a touch of citrus that appears more as the beer warms. reminds me of those chocolate-covered candied oranges.  surprisingly bitter taste. malty sweet followed with a hoppy aftertaste of pine and citrus. chocolate in the taste is more bitter than sugary. a touch more sweetness in the flavor would make this one more balanced. the appearance and the aroma are top-notch, though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,sulldaddy,2.98,"I had a pint of this while visiting Kclingers. THe beer comes in a pint glas and there is a thin creamy tan head floating on the surface. The color of the beer is drak brown with no lite passing through when held up. The aroma is rich and chocolatey, no surprise there. The chocolate is actually fairly sweet like cocoa powder of a hershey bar. First sip reveals a fairly thick body and very mild carbonation. Nice and smooth beer. Then the flavor, things go down a little here IMO. The beer is very sweet chocolate flavored like eating a candy bar over and over. By about mid pint it gets to be very cloying and not very enjoyable. Maybe with some fruit or vanilla ice cream but with a dinner it is just too much sweet chocolate. Of course if you really dig that this is for you. I am turned off by the overdose of chocolate and wish it was some more roasted notes or coffee to balance the sweetness.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,whynot44,4.62,"Dark opague brownish black brew with a very nice tan head that sticks around moderately well and leaves lots of coffee colored lace.  The aroma is dark cocoa, dark roast coffee and roasted malt with some hints of citrus hops.  The taste is the same, rich roasted malt, dark chocolate and espresso. Starts mildly sweet but is immediately overcome by the bite of dark roasted malt and dark chocolate. Finishes somewhat dry with hints of grapefruit or pine.  Very smooth and drinkable. A very nice cool weather beer, went well with a hearty beef stew and very nice after dinner. Very good stuff.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,AltBock,4.53,"22oz. bomber bottle with a nice silk screen label that has a picture of fellow Roguester Sebbie Buhler. I'm not sure who she is, but this beer is dedicated to her. She's wearing a bright red jacket, a mug of this beer in her left and holding some chocolate in her right. It had the usual Rogue information and no date on the side. Rogue says this beer goes well with beef and dessert and probably with their Chocolate Stout Cheese.  Appearance: When poured into my Samuel Smith pint glass, the beer was a very dark brown/black color with a head of tan colored foam that was about 1in in height. It also left plenty of tan colored lace and rigns around my pint glass. Very Nice indeed!  Smell: It had a pleasant aroma of dark chocolate (of course), roasted coffee beans, dark roasted malt, and plenty of hops. In fact thats what it smelled like (hoppy) when I first popped the cap. I got the roasted smell when I poured it.  Taste: It tasted exactly like it smelled. There was plenty of bitter dark chocolate up front, roasted malt and roasted coffee beans in the middle, and at the end, a slight hoppy aftertaste. Excellent taste!  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and some light carbonation. That bitter hoppy chocolate aftertaste in the back of your mouth doesn't seem to want to leave just yet.  Drinkability: This is one beer that I wouldn't mind to have again. Easy to drink and hands down one of the best brews made by Rogue. If you like chocolate beer, then you'll love this one.  My 100th Beer Review!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RoBotGod,4.35,"No disappointments from this beer. It defiantly lives up to its name. The pour looked great. Dark and rich with the head being a dark brown. The smell was great. It was like you had just taken a chocolate cake out of the oven. The chocolate was there but you could still get a whiff of the good stout flavor. It was very smooth, good flavor. Kind of reminds me of chocolate milk.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,hanco005,4.4,"I have waited so long to try this. The bottle has a woman holding a mug of the brew and a big smile on her face. A red bandana adorns her neck and she smiles at me as she knows I am getting ready to enjoy it. The bottle boasts of being made with imported chocolate. The bottle also claims it is made with Pacman YeastI never was never any good at PacMan.but Ms. PacMan is another story. I know, shut up and review it for crying out loud.  650ml bottle into a pint glass, but not all at once, mind you.  Adark brown and thick, 2 inch cocoa colored thick mushroom like head, which slowly fades into a thin dusting on the top. A massive thick lacing remains on the glass, like a cocoa cloud.  Sall I can smell is gourmet dark chocolate, very sweet and inviting. I am trying to smell other scents, but cant.  Tstrong bittersweet chocolate taste, not near as sweet as the smell. The bottle says an earthy flavor of oats and hops that gives way to a rich chocolate truffle finishYes, indeed (although I am not really tasting the oats). This is wonderful!  Mthick and chewy, mild carbonation.  DAbsolutely wonderful. The bittersweet chocolate flavors make this one great. Any more sweetness would ruin it. Outstanding! Couldnt drink more than this bottle, though. It is incredibly thick. A great dessert brew!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,EmoBeerGuy,4.37,"Pours dark dark dark. Nice head. On the nose one can tell this isn't a chocolate stout in the realm of youngs, this one plays for keeps. Thick and chocolatey, the beer is brewed, I believe, not only with chocolate malts but also with real chocolate. The result is a rich, smooth, sweet masterpiece.  Beers like this keep Rogue at the top of the list of American breweries.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ChainGangGuy,4.3,"Appearance: Pours black with brown highlights and a sizeable cappuccino head, which while it's initially rather pillowly, doesn't last for very long.  Smell: I haven't had one of these in awhile, but friends, I can tell you quite categorically... it smelled exactly as I remembered.  Largely black roasted malts blended with toasted caramel, a rich earthiness, and just the merest amount of hops.  Taste: Sweeping chocolate taste (as in a baker's chocolate, not the overly sweet chocolate you'd get at Easter as a kid), with a dash of espresso and a hint of almond. The finish is slightly bitter and plentiful, reminiscent of a fresh espresso or a fine cocoa powder.  Mouthfeel: Medium-thin; a bit lighter than I would prefer. Thankfully, it's not overly fizzy, keeping it creamier on the tongue.  Drinkability: Phenomenally well-balanced, and very drinkable. A good stout is tough to beat, that's for sure.  Still though, you put a gun to my head and say ""name your #1""? I dunno. Gotta go, like, double stout. Or strong ale. Or a nice lambic. Or a good juicy IPA.  Or a barleywine!  Yes, maybe it's that.  Maybe it's a barleywine.  Still though, this is a darned good stout!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,assurbanipaul,4.83,"Pours black and thick as crude oil with a foamy walnut head. No light gets through this pour. Nose is thickly malted, winey in character and slightly sweet with rich chocolate. Nice lacing.  Taste is rich, bold, full-bodied and bitter. Most of the chocolate flavors are either in the aroma or very high on the palate, since the taste is roasty, dry and malty as a quality stout should be. A bit nutty, a little bit of espresso, nutmeg, oats, some Imperial flavors as well, a mild hop bite. This ain't the oversweet Hershey's but some kind of fine silky Eurochocolate instead -- a very good choice.  Low carbonation, pleasant dark chocolate aftertaste. A wonderful pairing of the stout and the chocolate, with neither overpowering the other. One of the few beers here I feel is truly underrated.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smells like hot chocloate....Hot chocolate made from dark chocolate....Mmmm....  Taste is amazing. A rich dark chocloate taste unlike any chocolate stout I've ever tasted. It's a bit on the bitter side, and there are hints of malt - but it's all about the chocolate!  Nice carbonation, boisterous body.  Insanely easy to drink, has been a favorite for many years. I'm glad I finally found a place to get it regularly.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,abcsofbeer,4.62,"Poured this one from a 22oz bottle with no freshness date to speak of. Pours the blackest brew color I have witnessed so far. There is a very nice creamy brown head about a finger high that leaves wonderful sheets of Belgian lace on the glass sides.  The aroma is as expected from the name, very chocolatey, much like a candy bar. It is accompanied by a sweet caramel and buttery aroma.  The taste can only be described one way, chocolate followed by a mild and nicely added bitterness that is a combination of malts and hops. There is a slight hint of biscuit and bread in there as well. Overall, a very pleasant beer to drink and very well made.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,danielocean03,4.15,"Poured an opaque black with a thin brown head from a 22oz bomber, that fell quickly to light foamy off white lacing. Aroma is rich of many types of chocolate, mainly a bittersweet/bakers chocolate and some roasted malt also present. Smells very good, nice blend of sweet and bitter chocolate. Taste is powerful chocolate and malt, hints of hazelnut and berries, doesn't deliver as well as the aroma implies, but still very good. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied, moderate to heavy carbonation, maybe a little too carbonated. Drinkability good, pretty rich tasting brew, would be an excellent dessert pairing for complementing something sweet with the faint chocolate bitter aftertaste from this impressive beer. Would purchase again, my wife has some interest in this beer as well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

OK if you don't taste chocolate drinking this beer then go see a doctor imediately. Again all the different characters of chocolate are folwing thru this beer, milk dark, bittersweet.

132,1118,TurdFurgison,4.18,"Poured from large Rogue bottle into 2 pint glasses. Appearance was so good, dark brown chocolate color with chocolate milk looking foam on top.  Taste was OK, but not as outstanding as the visual. Tasted a little light, not as chocolatey as expected. Kind of similar to Rogue mocha porter for me, in that I expected more based on the name and previous reviews.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,nickss,4.33,"Pours a gorgeous black with a monumental (and extremely audible) rocky brown head.  Smells of chocolate... pure and simple.... simply wonderful aroma. Bitter mocha aroma, with a touch of berries thrown in.  BIG chocolate taste... i can't emphasize enough how much I love this brew. Bitter mocha flavour, with a touch of espresso in there.  The mouthfeel could be a bit thicker. Not to say it's thin necessarily... I just feel a stout of this flavour should be extremely thick and chewy. Also... a bit more carbonated than I would like.  Very drinkable brew... the flavour is indeed chocolatey, but not so overwhelming it would prevent me from diving into another bomber or two of this in one night.  Rogue continues to impress me... definitely a beer to try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

M: Mouthfeel is pretty full and chewy. D: I'm not a big chocolate fan, but I do really like this beer. As always another very solid offering by Rogue. Not something that I could drink a lot of at once I don't think.

132,1118,stevegamburg,4.88,"This is a phenomenal chocolate stout. Had one last night and accidentally spilled some on the rug. The stain looks like black ink.  Pours pitch black with a thick, foamy, dark head that doesn't stick around for a long time. Smells spicy with chocolate and dark grain. Taste is full bodied with hint of chocolate and well roasted, almost burnt, grain with a very nice finish. Very silky and creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Highly drinkable for a heavy, full bodied stout.  This is an awesome stout. This is a tasty adult treat like chocolate milk was when I was a kid. I highly recommend it. Mmm...I want another.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kkipple,4.49,"On-tap at CW's Tap Room in Columbia, SC.  Appearance: Rogue Chocolate stout is a deep, opaque brown (nearly black) beer with a fine bubbly head that's the color of brown sugar. But really, who drinks this for the looks?  Smell: Pure cocoa. Barely anything else makes it out of the glass. A few malt scents escape, but this is just an intensely sweet, chocolate smelling beer.  Taste: Chocolate. Chocolate chocolate chocolate. What, you need more detail? Alright. Rich, thick, perfectly bittersweet cocoa. Dark chocolate in a glass. You won't notice anything else for the first few sips (or half pint). Just amazing chocolate flavors that coat the mouth.  Mouthfeel: Mildly warming, thick, heavy cocoa aftertaste. Slightly dry, just like you've eaten a bar of dark bittersweet chocolate.  Drinkable? Well, not for me. It's incredibly filling. I have no idea how many calories are in a pint of this but I'm not sure I want to.  This is an admittedly odd beer, and if you're not crazy about chocolate, it might be something to try once for the experience. However, if you, like me, relish a good dark bar of chocolate (Lindt's 70% for example...) then watch out. This beer will be the death of both your waistline and your wallet. Don't say I didn't warn you.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,waughbrew,4.45,"Very black with one of the darkest, most beautiful heads I have seen on a beer. Creamy with a few different shades of brown and tight lacing. The aroma is so alive! Chocolate bready malt in the front with raw leafy unroasted coffee beans backing it up - mouthwatering. Taste is largely lukecold coffee and cocoaish chocolate with a very strongly herbal lasting finish. Thin feel is not slick but smooth, almost casklike as it warms! Very very drinkable. One of the, if not the, best beer at this alcohol percentage. I slightly prefer the Shakespeare, but hell, why choose when you can have both. Wonderful.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Shiloh,4.27,"An exellent chocolate stout. This brew arrived a dark black colour with a thin, dark, tan head. Carbonation seems light but is diffacult to view. The body is lighter than anticipated...medium +. The aroma is of dark bakers chocolate and roasted grains. The taste is very pleasing, bringing the roasted barley, cascade hops and chocolate as one. The roasting affect and bitter chocolate leave a nice lingering after taste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,FLAbeergutinMASS,4,"Had this one on reserve for sometime now. Not a chocolate lover at all. However, I do enjoy a sweet blast once in a while. I had very high expectations for this one. It does have a hot chocolate flavor to it, almost like a powdered chocolate. The most distinguished characteristic is its dry aftertaste, I have yet to find this in a stout. Unfortunately I think it taste artificial, good, but fake.  If you like chocolate this is the one for you. A nice one off for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,Dithyramb,4.72,"Presentation: Served in a pint glass at Frisco's in Columbia. Deep opaque black brew with limited dark tan head. Had light retention and carbonation, but very nice lacing.  Dark malts and chocolate on the aroma is complimented extremely well in the flavor category. This is a big, creamy and smooth brew. Not too much in any category that would slow you down. Deep dark milk chocolate runs the show, with a hint of smokiness, bitterness, and coffee in the background. Very rich brew, being creamy and sugary goodness without sticking to your mouth. Most brands would throw in a bunch of bitterness just for bitterness. This one amazingly does not, making it even better. This went down like a double chocolate tort after a hearty steak. Yeah, you shouldn't have room, but somehow, it disappeared.  Desert in a bottle, this would be paired excellently with just about any desert on the planet. Frisco's plans on adding it to whipped cream, Frambroise reduction and vanilla ice cream. Yum.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,maddamish,4.24,"Appearance: Small head when poured. Lacing is minimal.  Smell: Expresso, Chocolate, Caramel and coffee notes. These are some pretty strong notes however.  Taste: Chocolate and expresso followed by a bitter malt aftertaste. More bitter than chocolate but still pleasing to the palate. A little more thin than I was expecting but still a solid presence. A fine offering by Rogue.  Notes: I heard a lot about this beer and while it was good, I was expecting a more pronounced chocolate than a bitter malt. If you like bitter stouts then please pick this up.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,lordofthewiens,3.3,"This poured a very dark brown, almost black with a substantial cafe au lait head. It had a sweet, chocolate odor. The taste was a little off-putting.

132,1118,objectivemonkey,4.73,"Pours pitch black, 1/2 inch of head beginning with and shrinks to thin head, and already with lacing down the glass, and has nice streaks and blobs of lacing all the way down. Smells of chocolate, dark and malty. Simply, lovely, though a bit too understated, which is about the only complaint I have for this beer. Taste is heavenly. Have I had a better chocolate stout? Perhaps, but this is up there. And as it warms, I only become more impressed. The great thing is, the chocolate taste doesn't overpower the beer taste, nor visa versa, that is, the chocalate and malts are balance each other almost perfectly. As far as mouthfeel goes, its interesting, because it gives you a little phiz in the beginning, is smooth through the middle, then gives you some tingle during the aftertaste with choclaty goodness to leave you wanting more. This might be the highest beer rating I've given, because this is one of the best beers I've ever had.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

M- suprisingly solid medium body. I expected it to have a much thicker feel. extremely smooth and actually refreshing, not something you see to often with a stout.  D- the easiest drinking stout ive ever had.  overall- i cant believe its taken me so long to try this beer. Its hands down the best stout ive ever had. Extreme smoothness coupled with a suprisingly refreshing feel that you dont expect from a stout. simply put, this is an excellent beer.  edit: as i finish off the 22oz, i think this is probably the most enjoyment ive ever got from drinking a beer.  rogue, please put this stuff in a 6pack.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Tupperwolf,4.34,"Very dark brown on the pour, quite opaque but not quite black; Centimeter-thick tan head that recedes to a creamy ring and leaves some tan rings around the glass as it settles. Tiny, frothy lacing.  Lots of chocolate on the scent, a combination of super sweet and bitter baker's chocolates and sweet espresso beans; Malty, with no evidence of hop oils, very sweet chocolate-coffee makes up the scent. Smells like cocoa with mini marshmallows. The chocolate they added definitely adds to the scent.  Now this tastes the way I like my stouts; I found Rogue's own Shakespeare Stout to taste too much like a regular porter. I think the addition of chocolate has made up for what they're missing. It'd be nice if they could find those flavors without adding anything, but I'm a little biased. There's a cheerful bitter baker's chocolate taste from the roasted malts, some hop oils bittering on the tongue; It's sleek and sweet, mostly, pretty well balanced stout.  Mouthfeel is thicker than the Shakespeare Stout, and I like that, too; Chewy and full, with minimal carbonation to distract from the flavors and sensations at hand. Lots of tasty milk-chocolate flavors hang out in the aftertaste.  Pretty drinkable; No alcohol prescence, tasty and thick. A satisfying stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Illinick,4,"A: Extremely dark brown, opaque, with a small caramel brown head and good lacing throughout. S: Roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, sweet bread and some nut scents-almondy, hazelnutty scents. Chocolate is the real winner here. T: Nice flavors of bittersweet chocolate, nut, malty-sweet bread and some notes of oat with a touch of coffee and smokey/earthy flavors. The malt is there but is subsided by the presence of other flavors. Definate hop presence that provides a well infused bitterness to round out and offset other flavors. Chocolate is the backbone, but does not dominate the taste profile. MF: medium and somewhat bitter. Overall: Has a nice flavor profile-the chocolate is matched well against hop bitterness. To be honest I expected more of chocolate flavor; however, the complexity of the flavors and the hop bitterness made this a quality brew. Nice brew for the cold weather also.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Jacobier10,4.34,"On-tap @ The Publick House in Brookline, MA.  Pours an opaque black color with a small tan head. This might come as a shock, but this beer actually smells like real chocolate! If you blindfolded me and put the beer and a chocolate bar in front me, I would be hard-pressed to tell which one was which. The taste is great as well, but I did not receive the chocolate rush that I did from the aroma. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Slightly bitter from the use of hops brings the drinkabikity down a bit, but it's still great for a stout. This beer was a treat to have on tap and left me feeling very satisfied.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Shovelbum,4.82,"Pours a big creamy dark mocha head over a black body. Wispy sheets of lace and a decent ring of foam all the way down. Aromas of chocolate, sweet malt and floral hops. Complex and rich flavors of bitterswet chocolate, roasted malt, nuts, vinous fruit and mild sweetness-- all counterbalanced by a subdued hop bitterness. Full bodied, moderate carbonation. Smooth and creamy in the mouth with a drying finish.  As a chocolate lover, I find the chocolate component of this beer to be extremely well-executed; it is definately a major presence, but complements the other flavors without downing them out. The hop level is similarly well-done--contributing to aroma and flavor, without throwing things out of balance. Overall, this a complex and well-crafted stout, suitable for dessert or simply good drinking.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,daliandragon,4.24,"I've been staring at the rows of Rogues staring at me every week as I peruse through the local beer distributor. The artwork of the different people on the bottles is really cool but some of them kind of freak me out a little. At any rate, I decided to take a break from the English ale shelves tonight and give Rogue a shot. Pours evenly into a pint glass, displaying a perfect black color and modest but thick chocolate foam. I'd love to see a little more head but I'm already being knocked out by the smell. Deep, rich, milk chocolate hits my nose, with backup from dark roasted malt and hops. A slightly sour note is also present but strangely a perfect mesh with all the chocolate. The taste is surprisingly dry and pleasantly bitter. Lots of delicious malt but without much of the usual sweetness. Coffee and raisins are two familiar flavors I can identify. The texture is smooth without being silky and the mouthfeel lasts long after the beer is down the gullet. Overall, this beer is delicious, smells amazing, and is very well made but seems to fall just short of true stout greatness for me. Still, definitely worth a $3.99 flier every once in a while in the winter.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,smcolw,4.25,"Very dark brown with a deep beige head (light brown?). Three-finger head from the pour, excellent ring lace on the glass side with each sip.  Strong cocoa aromas, almost like hot chocolate mix. Some sweetness to the smell. Some dark malts come through; no discernible hop.  Very chocolatey taste with very little sweetness. I like how the beer transitions to a subtle hop flavor. Perhaps the only flaw is that aftertaste is so brief. Thick body, similar to hot chocolate. Appropriate carbonation. Nice complexity with lots of differing tastes coming through at different points of the taste. The balance at the swallow is something special.  Do you like chocolate? If so, this is a great beer. It does not have the usual overdone flavors, just a wonderfully balanced brew. If you're expecting a dry stout, this will be quite distracting. Go with cocoa flow and enjoy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,TheEclecticGent,3.86,"One of the better Rouge beers in my opinion. This stout has a very dark brown color (thick and rich), a brown head with even carbonation. The smell is a very light hint of chocolate. A very stout taste with chocolate overtones and even more chocolaty aftertaste  nice. Its has a light mouth feel for a stout.

Smell = Deep, dark chocolate with robust toasted malt. Fainter and lighter than expeected but what's there is good. I expected it to be much more intense.  Taste = Disappointing given the hype. Chocolate is there but overwhelmed by a sourness that drowns out the other flavors.While I like hoppy flavors this sourness feels wrong on every level, especially in this particular style. This feels like a mismatch that isn't balanced. It's not bad though with average taste and drinkability but very disappotining given the huge expectations. The mouthfeel is also thin and watery, not what I'd expect from a stout.  Overall = An OK stout that I draink with apathy.

Taste: True to the smell there is alot of chocolate floating on roasted coffee. This beer has a very pleasing bitter sweet chocolate sort of taste.

Rich and creamy milk chocolate, toffee, hazlenut, a touch of sweet vanilla. Very strong, and silky chocolate/cocoa aromatics. Reminiscent of a melted milk chocolate bar in a pot of freshly brewed hazlenut coffee.  Moderate roasted malt character that is more mellow and silky than most other stouts, due to the semi-sweet flavors: sweet toffee, chocolate, light nuts. A hop bite cutting through the rich chocolate flavors at mid-sip, that leaves a lingering toffee, coffee, and light alcohol in the aftertaste.  Full bodied; syrupy with flavors that back up the strong consistency. Covers the palate nicely, like a piece of melted chocolate.  A very flavorful version of the style. Unique, yet still true to the style. I don't see myself getting tired of this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The lacing continued to stick for the entire beer which surprised me. Aroma is clearly chocolate. Just like a bag of Hershey's Cocoa powder. The malts are also a little toasty smelling, but mostly hidden by the sweet smell of chocolate. Taste is outstanding and actually has good balance between the sweet chocolate malts and hops, which became more noticeable as I drank the beer. Hops have a grassy quality. Creamy, but finishes a little dry and surprisingly crisp. One word can sum this one up. Wow.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Suds,4.47,"This brew pours a dark, nearly black color with a dense tan head of moderate height. Decent lace, coupled with the visual perception of thick heaviness and serious viscosity make this an attractive one. This is another one of those beers that deserves lots of nose attention: big-time chocolate malt, deeply roasted grain, oats, dark coffee. Its a little grainy at the start, and moderately sweet. The mouthfeel is full, robust, and creamy. Its an experience. Light bitterness in the finish as a balance. This one is a wonderful, no-nonsense piece of art.

Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate! No suprise here. Just a hint of roasted malt.  Taste starts off with a tiny burnt/roasted malt bitter bite followed by a very silky chocolate taste. Almost like a hot coco powder but more towards the dark chocolate side. Not overly sweet or heavy. The best part is that it tastes like real chocolate unlike some beers that have the chocolate name in their label.  The mouthfeel is very smooth and milk like with just a hint of carbonation. Suprisingly light as it sits in your belly which is great because I could sip this all night long.  As far as chocolate beers go, this is the best I have had. Makes an excellent dessert by itself but I am sure it would go excellent with a slice of chocolate cake (perhaps it would even make a good cake!).

I drank the Young's a few nights ago and was bitterly dissapointed, I don't feel that young's is up to the hype. This beer however is about as prefect as I could imagine from a chocolate stout. Pours as black as any beer i've seen with a frothy mocha colored head which was moderate but left nice lacing, Aroma was soft and subtle but difinitely chocolatey. Doesn't really even seem like smelling beer, it is so subtle and candylike. Taste is just right, chocolate is definitely the key here but it changes to mocha and then to coffee in the finish. I was worried that this would be too sweet but it is perfectly balanced and with each taste I respect what Rogue have done here that much more. Truly a world class effort, I suspect this is now the bar by which any chocolate stout will be judged.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Very creamy looking head which holds well and leaves erratic lacing all over the glass. It smells very chocolaty, creamy, and vastly rich.  It tastes very creamy and..well.chocolaty (what did you expect?). It initially tastes of molasses which quickly fades to softer and silkier tastes of smoke and lightly sweet chocolate. The beer has a soft bitterness to it and goes down smooth and is not as heavy as one might expect. A very chewy beer.  Taken as a whole, this beer is terrific. This is what I have been looking for in a chocolate beer. It tastes very strongly of chocolate (which is more than some other chocolate beers can say). Big body and bold flavor with fine balance makes for a great beer. Try it with chocolate cake; good stuff!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

As I smell this beer all the aromas I talked about milk chocolate, brown butter(butterscotch), coffee, floural hops, caramel, sugar, vanilla, are all on display in this beer. The taste of this beer just explodes on your palate. It starts with a vanilla chocolate sweetness then moves to a bitter hop kick followed by a coffee essence and finally finishes with a silky smooth butterscotch aftertaste.

Tan/brown head with some lacing and a little head retention.  Smells like dark chocolate. Fairly strong aroma, but very complex tho. Tastes like dark chocolate too, and again, lacks complexity. No roasted malt flavors to be found. At 69 IBUs this beer is surprisingly balanced however.  Interesting mouthfeel, a bit heavy, but very smooth drinking. Big flavors, but not overwhelming.

The beer poured black with short tan head that left thin, fine lacing down the side of the glass. The beer smelled - literally - like some hot chocolate or cocoa. The flavor was chocolate followed by an immense roasted malt character and a lingering coffee after taste. Absolutely spectacular. This beer is a true pleasure and an absolute delight. It's incredibly drinkable, and - even though a flavored or ""chocolate stout"" - one of the best american stouts I have ever tried.

132,1118,MSchae1017,4.63,This beer was tasted in a pint glass from a 22oz. bottle.  I had to rate this beer the same as I did their Shakespeare Stout. To see that review click this link http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/132/359/?ba=MSchae1017 The only difference from this and the Shakespeare stout was that the head was a significantly darker color and that the smell and taste of the beer had a distinct chocolate flavor to it. These factors do not make the beer any better or any worse in my opinon just different. And to be honest with you being different is one of the greatest qualities of any beer. This normally factors greatly into my drinkability,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,stevecee2003,3.9,"I poured this beer from a large bottle (1 pint 6oz.) into a large glass mug. It made a nice dark foamy head. It stayed on the sides with a nice lace, and pours very well, with a dark hint of what's to come.  The smell has a nice chocolaty aroma, and some hints of burnt malts. But a good combination. I am comparing this to my favourite chocolate: Youngs Double-Chocolate Stout, and it does stand up. To a certain degree.  It feels VERY good in your mouth, and that may be it's best attribute. Soft and warm. A burnt malt taste is over-riding. But the chocolate is ever-present! It's a mixture of deep warm flavours, with those malts and a slight hint of fruitiness. This beer just smells good.  It is a good choice if you like these type of brews. I was surprised how good it was, and will drink it again. Definately worth the adventure.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Phatz,4.27,"Presentation: This beer comes in one of Rouge's signature screen-printed 750ml bottles (pretty cool).  Appearance: It pours out like a reddish motor oil. I got a very nice 3 finger head that was a chocolaty light brown with a cherry red tint to it. This stout sits in the glass a brown that is so dark it looks black. While pouring it I could see the reddish hue and when I tipped the glass or swirled it could again see the red/brown hue that looked black again when the glass returned to the table. This is completely opaque with absolutely no light passing through.  Smell: As the name would suggest it is overwhelmingly chocolate (pleasantly though, this is a good thing). Opening the bottle before I even poured it I could tell it was chocolate. While pouring it I could smell the chocolate and as the head rose, it forced more chocolate smell up into my nose. This is not a beer that you have to go hunt for the aroma; instead it reaches out of the glass, slaps you in the face and shouts 'notice me'! I like that. It is bold. After the chocolate smell was done slapping me in the face I noticed a smell of dark cherries, and another dark sweet smell of black licorice or maybe birch beer, and then earthy coffee undertones. Fantastic.  Taste: For as much chocolate as you smell, the taste (fortunately) is not terribly overwhelmingly chocolate; it is more moderate. The taste of course is like the smell but it is a bit less complicated. The chocolate flavor is wrapped around a red, slightly cherry, almost birch or rootbeer flavor. But not the soda. Not the birch or root after they have been sweetened more like the birch bark. It is slightly sweet but the sweet has a significant tart to it in the aftertaste that makes your tongue curl up on the edges as you swallow. By the end of the glass the coffee (and tar-ish) flavors come forward more to sit beside the chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Certainly a full-bodied beer. Very thick feeling but not overly heavy-- maybe a medium pushing toward heavy. DRY! The aftertaste leaves your mouth with a tart dry feeling (like it needs a chaser). Fortunately having a bit of chocolate nearby works as the perfect chaser to take the sharp tip off of the tartness.  Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer; however the tartness in the aftertaste requires one of two things (for me); either immediately take one after another sip to keep the front end flavor, which speed up the inevitable inebriation; Or drink with food, using your chocolate, desert, or meal as a chaser, which prolongs the glass. In either case it is still very pleasant on the front end, and very manageable on the backend. I recommend this beer. Enjoy.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smells of really high quality hot chocolate, not that Swiss Miss shit, earthy and sweet in the nose.  Delicious. There really isn't much else to say. Very rich chocolate flavors with an earthy bitterness in the end. The mouthfeel is like velvet that leaves behind an ever so slightly prickly carbonation as it goes over the tongue. I have to keep myself from downing this bottle so quickly. So enjoyable to drink.  With a name like Chocolate Stout, I was expecting this to be way to sweet. Rogue did an excellent job. The bitterness in the end is perfectly done in contrast to the chocolate flavors, making this like a liquified block of dark chocolate. I really don't see how this beer can be improved.

132,1118,beerphilosopher,4.3,"Poured into a standard pint glass from a 22oz bottle.  A - Mostly opaque jet black with deep brown accents. Hot cocoa-colored thick head. Didn't last long ... reemerges when swirled in the pint with sporadic lacing.  S - Initially, not as strong or as robust as I would have expected. Then I realized I hadn't let this bottle adjust to the proper serving temp before pouring. As it warmed, the aromas were much more apparent. Quite simply, this beer smells of dark chocolate ... almost as if I were holding a pint full of baker's chocolate shavings. Possibly a hint of hop notes in there somewhere, swimming in a sea of rich cocoa.  T - Honestly, one sip of this offering from Rogue and I am instantly in love with this brew. It is, by far, the very best chocolate stout I have ever been honored to sample. Absolutely sinfully good. I am drinking it as I write and am quite literally overwhelmed with dark chocolate heaven ... again, as if I am drinking melted baker's chocolate in a glass. NOT overly sweet, and I do taste the presence of some hops in there too. The Rogue guys have outdone themselves with this one. Almost pure chocolate flavor here ... to the point you almost need to remind yourself this is a beer.  M - As expected over all, but possibly the ONLY downside to this beer is that it feels just a little thinner than I'd like. But, just a little. I actually appreciate that this stout doesn't bruise your palate with overly thick, heavy body that leaves you desiring something that more closely resembles liquid. Perhaps this isn't such a downside after all ...  D - Not only the very best tasting chocolate stout I've ever had, but also clearly the most drinkable (see above). You could drink these all night if given the chance ... and oh how I'd like the chance. The more I drink it, the more I'm grateful that this beer isn't too heavy which would limit how much I could tolerate at a sitting.  Drink this one alone at least once, in order to fully appreciate what the Rogue folks have done here. Then, by all means, try it with some high quality cheeses, or possibly a rich chocolate dessert of some sort. This beer is a MUST DRINK for chocolate lovers and/or stout lovers. You'll likely be both when you've drained your pint.  Exceptional beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Taste - This beer tastes of caramel, with a finish thats malty and  you guessed it  chocolaty.  Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is chewy, creamy, medium-full-bodied, rich and smooth.

T- This beer has a nice earthy robust dark malt flavor with some hints of dark slightly sweet chocolate, although the beer itself is not sweet.

Smells of Hershey kisses or a big Hershey bar. Wonderful. Not much in the way of hops. Notes of caramel and even vanilla as well. Smells like a chocolate cake in a glass. Wonderful.  Exceptional taste. The chocolate flavor is the predominant flavor in this stout. Wonderful, creamy chocolate taste. Tastes like a mix of a dark chocolate and milk chocolate thrown into a barrel of quality stout. There is actually a bit of hoppines in there as well. A tiny hop bite hits the back of the tongue as the tasty beverage flows down the gullet. I really cant think of a better dessert beer.

Almost black, great tan foam that sticks around forever and coats the glass. The smell is domineering chocolate. The taste...wow it's almost too chocolatey to be a beer. You could confuse it for some sort of chocolate liqueur until the roasted malt kicks in gently to balance the chocolate taste. There is also some molasses sweetness hiding underneath it all, which in my opinion really completes this brew. That's all I get here, but the interplay is done to perfection. The finish is mildly bitter and dry from the chocolate and the acidity of the malt. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and thick for a beer of this ABV - definitely is only hurt by the decadence of it all. This is amazing.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

A great tasting chocolate flavor that does not quit. Even seems to have a tiny hint of hoppy flavor, with a tiny bit of balancing bitterness that prevent it from being too sweet but rather just right. Nevertheless, the chocolate flavor is dominant, and delicious.  M - Feels nice and light on the tongue, and a little fizzier than other stouts. Still a nice smooth stout overall.  D - Very good.

132,1118,wedge,4.5,"Dark black/brown with a light tan foamy, rocky head...good retention. Aroma is of bittersweet chocolate, dark and sweet - dry with some roasted malts. Deliciously sweet and chocolately. Flavor is rich and smooth - bittersweet/dark chocolate with low bitterness. Appropriate carbonation and smooth thanks to the oats. Lightly dry.  Just a damn tasty stout. This beer is exactly what it advertises. If you want a chocolate stout, look no further.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,tastybeer,4.62,"Wow chocolate. Black with cocoa brown head. Smells intense chocolate, sweet caramel, roasted dark chocolate. Taste explodes with strong chocolate, bitter and sweet, with an all over roasty taste. Full and thick, and carbonation seems to come out of the chocolate taste. Tantalizingly drinkable.   You could probably make chocolate out of this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,beckerboots,4.6,This stout is the top of the food chain as far as the evolution of American beer ingenuity goes. It's like putting Laura Secord in a bottle. Dark brown appearance with ample lacing and serious retention. The smell/taste/mouthful aspect of this stout was like a 6-4-3 double play in baseball; it just flowed to a natural progression culminating with a chocolate experience unlike any I've ever had before. Exceptional drinkability may be a gross understatement as this maybe one of the five finest beers I've ever had the pleasure to sip (and sip and sip and sip). Kudos to the Rogue Brewery.

132,1118,SurgeonGeneral,4.72,"Serving temp: 50F Serving glass: Pint glass  Appearance: Very opaque black with a dark tan head that dissipates rather quickly, but hangs on as a thin film throughout drink. Pretty good lacing.  Aroma: Roasted malts hit me first. Then, the chocolate. This is the first sweet smelling chocolate beer I've ever had, similar smell to a good hot chocolate, along with other aromas. Faint coffee smell. Slight bit of citrusy hop notes.  Taste: Not nearly as sweet tasting as the smell, but the chocolate is defintely there. More bittersweet in the taste, though. And just as well, I wasn't expecting a milkshake. Sweetness now comes in the form of raisens & figs. Hoppy bitterness with a little bit of citrus fruit is pretty big in the taste from what I was expecting after smelling it.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied & creamy. Not chewy or anything, but it coats the mouth very well and leaves sticky residue allover my lips. YUM! Ever just stick a half a teaspoon or so of cocoa powder in your mouth and chow down? That's the feeling this brew leaves you with. Well, not quite as *dry* as that, but if you've tasted pure cocoa, you know.  Drinkability: This is a fabulous brew, replacing Youngs Double Chocolate as my favorite chocolate beer. The sweet aroma & contrasting bitterness is balanced so well. And the finish just makes me want to have more. Hmm.. I think I will.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,1whiskey,4.27,"The Aztecs believed that chocolate, in liquid form, was ""the nectar of the gods"". You know, they just may have been on to something with that..  22 oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. Pitch black color, big 3 finger dark brown head lingers for a while and leaves considerable lacing all the way down.  Before I could even pour it, my entire kitchen smells like mexican mocha. HUGE chocolate aroma. Impressive!  Taste is as advertised...rich and dominated by semi-sweet cocoa. Bitter alkaloids and burnt coffee contast with the rich chocolate, but don't overwhelm the beer. Somewhat distant hops are buried far beneath the huge chocolate taste.  Despite the near pudding-like heavy body, this is quite carbonated and suprisingly drinkable.  My only real complaints here (and they are minor) is that at 6% ABV, I really shouldn't be able to taste the alcohol. The balance leans slightly on the bitter side, just a hair more sweetness and this would be an instant favorite for dessert. That said, this is a very good stout and a must-try for any stout or chocolate lover. Floats anyone?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,sinistrsam,3.29,"This nice-looking stout pours thick and creamy, with a medium-sized dark-tan head that is populated by large bubbles. It dies off quickly, leaving almost no lacing. It looks completely opaque, even when held to the light. I took one whiff and immediately fell in love; almost completely chocolate, but smooth milk-chocolate, not overpowering. A very light malty nose, with hints of hazelnut and coffee. I was excited to try it and hoped the sweet smell didnt leave me disappointed. I hate to say it, folks. I was. Ive come to expect great thins from Rogue, and everyone else seems to be in that boat. The sweet, chocolaty smell led me to believe it would be a bit sweeter than it was. I know, I know its a stout, and should be treated as such, but the first thing I noticed was the bitter and highly carbonated mouthfeel. It was dry, smoky, with less chocolate than I was expecting. It most closely resembled chewing on a coffee bean; more bitter than anything. The feel wasnt flat, but rather the taste. I thought I must have served it too cold so I waited a few minutes. And waited. And waited.and still, an even slight sweetness wasnt there. I suppose it got slightly sweeter after a few minutes, but it was more or less flat tastes of bitter cocoa, oat, alcohol and coffee. It wasnt very rich. Im not writing off Rogue by any means. It could be a bad bottle; I might have served it incorrectly. I dont know, but I have to admit I was hoping for a little bit more drinkable beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The chocolate is the dominant flavor but also has some smoky and malty characters. Hops were not too evident. Really smooth to drink, unfortunately it was on special by the pitcher and even with pawning some off on my skeptical friends I was overwhelmed after two pints. It really s quite bittersweet. Very enjoyable for a pint or two.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Dark dark dark color with an absolutely beautiful creamy brown head. Smells chocolatey, with a hint of dark fruit waaaay in the background. Deep, very rich. Tastes delicious- at first you get a wave of coffee and burntness, and then the chocolate sneaks up on you. Deep, rich, complex, and not overly sweet and cavity-producing. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and creamy. I could not drink a bomber of this on my own... but it's damn good. Drink your dessert. Cheers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ommegangpbr,4.13,"Chocolate milk. Yoohoo. Milk stout like. The chocolateynessis a bit overdone, but for chocofans, this is a fine brew to have around. Smooth. Very smooth. Not as hoppy as expected... a bit more might make this a bit more interesting. Good though. Pleasing to the palate. Some might even wax poetic at it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,lpayette,3.94,"22oz. Bomber  Chocolate and Oatmeal aromas. Pours dark brown, with light brown creamy head. Bittersweet(mostly bitter) taste similar to baking cocoa. Noticible taste of hops.

132,1118,wingnutter,4.15,"All I can say about this beer is WOW.  Pours a deep black with a creamy head. Looks like carbonated liquid chocolate. Beautiful and inviting.  Smell: Heavenly bakers chocolate, mellow malt, and a slight hop presence. Is this really beer? The hell you say!  Taste: SMACK! Chocolate just explodes in the mouth and finishes wonderfully. So tasty. Every time I took a drink it begged me to take another. So I complied. Bakers chocolate right up front, with a hint of coffee and toffee right behind it. The 22oz bottle was gone in no time, and left me wanting more. BIG chocolate flavor without being too sweet. Mouthfeel was excellent - frothy, heavy, and creamy. Has a nice dry finish that makes you want to take another drink immediately.  Excellent drinkability, an instant favorite...  At 6% ABV its not too strong, and would make a nice dessert after a steak dinner. Try eating some chocolate while drinking this beer. Amazing.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,slitherySOB,4.33,"Very black stout. Black like, well, dark chocolate. Pours with a decent, one finger brown head that lasts for most of the duration. No lace, but that's okay. Smells mainly of dark chocolate, with a subtle hint of roasted malts. Hmm, very bittersweet taste. Sweet and bitter dark chocolate, with a bit of a roasted toast taste as well. Nice. Very nice. Mouthfeel is, hmm. Not light, but ligher than expected? I guess medium light. Good, but I was expecting something thicker. Drinkable? Hell yes. Perhaps not session beer drinkable, but one could drink these all night and not get tired of it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Gagnonsux,4.28,"The color is pitch black with a light-brown head that is incredably thick and creamy. The aroma is of dark baker's chocolate with a nice bit of roastiness thrown in as well. The taste is of an incredably rich, sweet chocolate flavor with a mild roast flavor. The dark chocolate flavors also provide a moderate bitterness that accenuate the incredable chocolatey flavor. A hint of hops gives the flavor a little bit of an edge and reminds you that you're drinking a Rogue product. Anyway, this is world class.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Melchizedek,4.3,"Great stout look, with a nice dark tan head, and totally opaque in the glass.  Smells like chocolate (!), dark, with a touch of supporting roasted grains--you don't get the whole character of this in the nose, but in the mouth it really shines. Chocolate up-front, mouthwatering with only a slight pudding sweetness, then all toasty grains and a great coffee bitterness follow. There's also a touch of earthy, subtle hop in the mix, which keeps the whole thing from being overly rich. A little metallic, maybe from the water? It finishes like chocolate milk, smooth and creamy. There's a little sharpness from alcohol and carbonation, but nothing severe--otherwise, one of the better mouthfeels I've experienced.  What a fun, tasty treat. This is a dessert unto itself, and a neat little novelty item--but surprisingly, there's a darn good stout in the midst of all the chocolate beer gimmickery.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,etaggie09,4.57,"Appearance: Jet black with a quickly disappearing espresso-tan head. Less than impressive lacing. A little underwhelmed by the appearance actually, but it wasn't bad.  Aroma: very earthy with some roastiness and cocoa. some sweet malty aromas pull through as well. quite nice really.  Taste: Cocoa, rich chocolate truffle, and roasted coffee bean. I think I enjoy this one more than I do the Shakespeare. It's got just a really nice layered flavor. And the chocolate is not really sweet as it is rich in its presence. Man I like this. A great stout with a twist.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy with moderate-high carbonation. A bit too much carbonation if you ask me, but this is still a killer stout. Mmmmm tasty.  Drinkability: Goes down very easily. A whole bomber of this stuff after dinner was a real treat.  Notes: Well this is probably one of my favorite stouts to date, although Shakespeare is right up there. Rogue does a really nice job with their stouts. They impressed me more than Old Rasputin or Samuel Smith's even, and those are imperials. Well done, Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,hoffman,4.38,"This is an excellent beer. Pours up thick and black smooth out of the bottle and appealing from the start. The head really rises more so than I would have expected to almost 2 1/2 fingers before settling out to 1/4 finger and lacing the glass forever. The head is mocha in color and had large pockets of air within exagerating the thick frothy texture. The smell is sweet and grainy heavy on chocolate and malt, this is decieving, understood when the flavor hits your tongue. This beer does not taste nearly as sweet as it smells, the light sugary flavor of the chocolate and malt is balanced more than adequately by an excellent hop base. The thick pour of this beer is a dead givaway to the smooth frothy feel. One of the best I have had from an overall standpoint, not an everday pour but nice for special occasions, will drink again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,KarlHungus,4.45,"This brew pours a black color with a big tan head. The aroma is as chocolatey as chocolate. As is the beer were chocolate milk.

132,1118,foamer,4.3,"Pours an absolute pitch black with a lovely thick tan head. A wonderful and pervasive semi-sweet baking chocolate aroma in the nose. Not much roastedness detectable; the chocolate really takes over. The taste is a near perfect blend of the chocolate into the stout flavours. It starts off with a semi-sweet chocolate but then blends seamlessly into the gentle roasted bitteness of the stout and finishes with a subtle hop bitterness. No one flavour dominates and the meld in a subtle interplay. A very nicely balanced chocolate stout. Nice smooth mouthfeel, with a gentle carbonation. A very lovely and exceedingly drinkable after-dinner beer. Quite pleased that the LCBO decided to get this in.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,waldowin,4.22,"Appearance - Poured an inky black. No light gets through at all, even when held up to a light. Perfect for a stout. The head is the darkest I've seen on a beer, such a dark brown that you'd have to dig for the blackest of stouts to find a *beer* that was darker than this head.  Smell - Smells of chocolate, truffles, vanilla, cream. A wonderful dessert confection smell.  Taste - Dark, dark earthy malts here. A bit of earth up front, a hint of dark fruits, and then a nice wash of dark chocolate with a vanilla finish. Almost like pouring melted vanilla ice cream into a root beer. The hops are almost nonexistant here.  Mouthfeel - Carbonation is a bit heavier than I'd like. For a beer this dark and yet this sweet, a nice thick almost syrupy feel would be better. It's still a very rich, chewy feel to it. You almost feel like you could eat it with a spoon. Wonderful.  Drinkability - It would be hard to find a food to pair this with, this is a dessert in itself. The wonderful freshly-cooked-truffle smell this has combines with the chocolate and vanilla tastes to make this a delight to drink. It's so rich however that it's pretty filling. I'd be hard pressed to drink more than one 22oz bottle (though I'd certainly give it a try). I'm very glad I can buy this locally.  On a side note, the label says 6% ABV, but I swear this has to be at least 8%, it hits pretty hard.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,beveragecaptain,4.4,"22 ounce bomber. This beer pours out dark brown with a brown head. The aroma is a delicious chocolate smell with some roasted malts. The flavor is very roasty. This is probably the best use of chocolate I've tasted in a beer. There is just a bit of sweetness, but this beer is mainly bitter. The hops are just able to come through the strong malt and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy. Make sure to let this beer warm up a little before you drink.

Has a milk chocolate and roasted caramel malt smell and a sweet flowery pine hops aroma.  Moderately sweet/bitter, milk/dark chocolate, coffee, and a roasted almost burnt malt taste with an orange/grapefruit hops flavor.  Medium bodied, dry and creamy almost watery texture, soft carbonation, and a metallic almost astringent finish.  I thought this might be good since it's rarely seen on the shelves. The initial balance is good and very drinkable and the finish has an initial strong but balanced metallic, grapefruit, and astringent smoothness.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Naes,3.94,"This one is black with a large frothy dark tan head. Its aroma is of bitter chocolate. The flavor has much more chocolate than I was expecting, but is balanced nicely with a bit of bitterness. The aftertaste is similar to a fancy chocolate bar. Roastiness and coffee are also present. For such a sweet beer, I must say that it is done quite nicely. Mouth feel is full bodied and generously carbonated. Goes down quite easily for such a sweet beer. Definitely worth a try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Enola,3.98,A good offering from Rogue. A nice thick & creamy head on a dark beer. Just the way I like em'. Tastes great with a pronounced roasted flavor. Lots of lacing.

Chewy bread, caramel, chocolate, coffee... a whole symphony of malt flavour, balanced with hop and roasty malt bitterness. Truly exceptional. The aftertaste evolves into bittersweet chocolate.  M: Thick, chewy body, moderate carbonation. A little chalky.  D: Awesome, but the body & strength prohibits it from being a long session brew. This one's more of a meal.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Pours very dark molasses color with a small head--not much lace but enough to warrant a 4.5. Solid beer all around, As I taste it more throughly, I think it may be as good as Young's dbl chocolate stout but it really is not. By far, the best American chocolate stout I have tried.  Tasting notes: Dark malt that is slightly charred (which is good) , dark semi-sweet chocolate, caramel, etc.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Overall a good drinker and not bad when your in the mood.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,CortexBomb,4.23,"Pours out perfect stouty black with an off-tan into my stein. The smell is mainly roasted malts and chocolate, which should be expected for a beer like this.  The flavour of the beer starts off strongly chocolatey, this is probably the most noticeably chocolatey beer that I've had to date. In addition to that there is a soft roasted characteristic and the faintest addition of hops, but enough to add flavour. There is also a certain creamy aspect. Really balanced all the way around though, even though the chocolate is the strongest flavour it is still far from overwhelming. The finish is a nice bitter bit. I like it. As the beer warmed the initial chocolate hit up front became more pronounced, but it still didn't overwhelm, and I think I actually liked it that way a bit more.  The mouth is a little thin for my tastes, but is average for a standard style stout. Drinkability is quite good.

Aroma brings forth some almond and coffee but the semisweet or dark chocolate comes throug strong.  Sweet malts give way to a sublte but still assertive chocolate presence. Just a hint of bitterness but in reality to roasted coffee from the malt is more prominent than the hops. Finishes with a warm chocolate flavor.  Full bodied and delicious, I could buy this all the time.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

This is the most chocolate tasting chocolate stout I've ever had---every sip has a rich chocolate note--you don't have to go searching.

Taste is a wonderful bittersweet chocolate with a rounded malt (roast bitterness and sweetness) backing. Finishes fairly bitter. Nice soft mousy mouthfeel.  This is one I wish I could find more often. Very tasty on its own, but would probably go very well with cocolate cake, brownies or ice cream...

132,1118,SkeeterHawk,4.29,"Appearance: Black as coal, but doesn't remind me of motor oil like the Stone Imperial Stout does. It poured with a thin tan head made up of small bubbles, but it didn't retain but for about a minute or so at the most.  Aroma: Some definite chocolate aroma's going on in here. They smell like cocoa rather than actual chocolate. This cocoa aroma gives it a ""dry"" edge and makes it smell like there may be oatmeal in here also.  Taste: The taste is really assertive at first sip. There is a bit of a bitter bite from the chocolate at first to go along with some light floral hops. I am thinking that the bitterness is also aided by some hops, but there isn't a lot of hop bitterness to this beer.  Opinion: This is an excellent beer. I really like how the chocolate is a noticeable addition rather than a sharp roast that comes from generous helpings of chocolate malt. I personally think that this beer could use an addition of oatmeal or lactose sugar or something to negate the bittering component added by the cocoa. Just a thought...but still an excellent beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

It smells like fucking chocolate cake.  I don't have too much to say about the appearance - thick, dark, not too much head. Fine by me.  The taste is fantastic to say the least - everything blends well - the chocolate, the roasty taste, the bitterness (but not TOO bitter). It slides down easily - no strange aftertaste.

Such as: mowing the lawn, doing the dishes, or making it to work on time.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,UncleJimbo,4.33,"Sampled on-tap at Redbones.  This stout poured as black as night with creamy, brown foam that settled to a thin coat and clung to the glass a bit. The smell was full of chocolate and cocoa with some mild maltiness as well. The taste was chocolatey -- darky bitter, with cocoa, malt and some bitter hoppiness in the finish. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with full body and good carbonation. The bitter chocolate flavor lingered in the aftertaste. Very nice. This was an excellent beer, and I wonder why I don't drink it more often?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,methtlcai,4.72,"I can't believe I waited so long to try this! Pours a jet black with a gorgeous mocha head (2 fingers thick)- the lacing was pretty sweet but retention could have been a little bit better. Such an awesomely powerful aroma- I kept sniffing this beer all the way through the 22nd oz. Smells like slightly bitter dark chocolate with just a tinge of roastiness. Taste is less bitter and more milky, thick and rich without being choking. Tastes just like milk chocolate, not like beer at all- definitely hides the alcohol. At least a top 3 stout if not the best (imperials not included)!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Sycodrummer,4.65,"Wow, been waiting on this one for a while. Watched many friends quaff this one down and now I've finally had the chance to do the same. Poured from the 22oz. black bomber into a mug the beer was jet black in colour with a thick, frothy, chucky, light brown three-finger head. The head on this beer was darker than most beers can claim to be. The head died down to about one-finger and remained there for the entire length of the sample. Big rings of lace formed all the way down the sides of the glass.  Chocolate just overpowered the nose of this beer. It's called chocolate stout and you get what you pay for: an intense dark chocolate smell of cocoa and candy bars. A semi-bitterness to the smell like rich dark chocolate. Perhaps some faint mocha as well and fudge like smell.  Taste is everything it's proclaimed to be. A rather (but appitizingly) bitter dark and burnt chocolate and coffee flavours upfront. The darkest of dark chocolate with a chicory like bitterness to every sip. A deep burt roast flavor like a coffee shop on fire and an almost slightly sweet fruit smell, like chocolate covered raspberries. A bitterness to each sip that's quickly balances by a malty smooth creamy finish. My only complaint would be the the chocolate is too overpowering here. I prefer a bit more subtle chocolate flavour such as that found in Young's Double Chocolate Stout and Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout.  Thick on the palate with almost no carbonation. Better, IMO a little on the colder than warmer side.  Wonderfully filling and very drinkable. Skip the dessert menu this beer will be far better than anything else there. Although perhaps a little too heavy in chocolate flavour, this is a great beer and one to revisit often.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BEERchitect,4.12,"After a long due subatical from this beer, it's time I sit down with a bomber to assess, or re-assess.  Boy, those initial aromas are succulent, inviting, and to a large extent- irresistable. The fresh baked brownie aromas wrap around the roasted coffee malts and caramelized barley to promise deep, rich flavors of bitter sweet gormet chocolates and coffee truffles. No fruitiness, not hops, not phenols, nothing to interfere with the cocoa and coffee focus.  Even before the aromas are realized, the beer takes on a look as fitting as the aroma. Very dark and opaque brown colors ride just below a heavily tanned head, much lacing, and a creamy, froathy foamstand. So far, a perfect beer.  Deep, roasty, toasty flavors of wood-fired malts provide the base for the Stout-worthy beer. Strong cocoa and milk chocolate flavors dare to compete, but never dominate. Instead the choco-flavors are religated to compliment the beer and provide a secondary, yet complex role for the heavily roasted coffee-like malts. These work in harmony to complete a perfect beer. ...but then there are the hops. In Rogue fashion, the hops that shows no role in the aroma or initial taste, show up at mid palate with a grassy flavor that begins, and continues to detract from the harmony created from the Stout-like coffee and added cocoa flavors.  Sharp, bitter, and with a slight aggresion that outplays the delicacy of the malts and chocolates, the hop seem to play the part of the 'bull in a china shop'. Beyond the creaminess and softness of the beer, the grassy piney character becomes a distraction to the mouthfeel and interferres with the finish, aftertaste, and secondary taste. Still, the textures have more to say beyond the hops; the beer remains creamy, smooth, and chocolatey otherwise.  Everything about this beer sings 'delicacy'. But those bullying hops, I could do without.  It's like chocolate milk for the beer dependent. Plops viscously into the glass. Raises a 1/2"" solid tan-brown head, laces well. Opaque brown - black in color. Smells boldly of cocoa, roasted grains, and a twinge of lactic acid. Tastes thick and rich of bittersweet chocolate, barley malt, and dark grains. Nice blend of alcohol warms into the body and thins the beer toward the finish. Lingers of chocolate and roasted grains. A slight hop bite remains in the back of the throat. A very good beer. Not a whole lot of different flavors, just 2 or 3 that are seriously bold. Now, I need to find a cookie and some ice cream.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Golden2wenty1,4.75,"Picked up a single at Steve's liquor here in Madison.  Pours pitch black, maybe the blackest stout I've seen. Barely a glitter of light through the edges when held up to a light. Big two finger coffee colored head with excellent retention and good lacing. Smell is amazing - cocoa powder, chocolate syrup, dark baker's choclate. I almost don't want to stop smelling it. Taste doesn't disappoint though. Same multi-faceted chocolate flavors as in the nose, with some mocha, espresso, and a slight hoppy bite in the finish. Not the most complex overall taste package, but a delicious one nonetheless. Mouthfeel is fairly well carbonated, smooth, yet crisp. I have found that Rougue Ales tend to be delicious, but fairly one-dimensional. Out of the 4 Rougues I've tried (Hazelnut Nectar, Mocha Porter and Shakespeare being the others) this is the most robust and interesting. Simply a world class stout if you like chocolate. Not overpoweringly sweet. Just the right amount of coffee/hop bitterness. A must try for any stout lover.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mentor,4.12,"Bottle obtained from Superior Liquor (Colorado) and consumed a couple evenings later in August 2005. Pours a two finger dark brown head over a pitch black liquid. No edging when held to light. Smells...wow. Chocolate, molasses, a hint of roast. Sweet, malty, chocolatey. Desert. Chocolate dominating the flavor with bourbon cherries underneath. Campfire wood. Fudge-cicle. Okay, a minute of sniffing and the head is a thin layer over the beer...what's it taste like? Starts chocolate with some cherry (ie, black patent) sour. While these start strong, they become very powerful during the swallow and in the aftertaste. As they rise, they get a more refined quality and a faint espresso/coffee-roast steps in, too. As strong as the flavors are, I'm surprised the flavors aren't clinging to my tongue. The body is heavy, but not thick. The finish is quite clean. Dry actually, with some hop bitter. A touch of citrusy hop flavor puts the chocolate on guard. Oddly, there is a flavor in my mouth, like I just toked on a cigarette after several months without one. Nah, maybe it's just a bit of wood flavor, like the wood that I found in the smell. Anyway, this was a really enjoyable beer. As much as I hate Rogue for the overpriced offerings they've recently put out (you know those bottles that are super-premium priced in flashy but stupid bottles), I have to admit, they make really tasty beers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DogFood11,4.67,JET BLACK!!! I've visited the rogue brewery a handfull of times and this is a must ...I hate chocolate...I love this beer...how can that be? Super fine carbonation cascades with every pull. Tan head leaves spider web lace. Well... they have crafted this puppy so beautifly that even a chocolate sweets hater like myself can love this beer..Mmmm  It feels like velvet...slick and oily but not too rich OMG....after visiting and watching american beer DVD I realize how much care the owner of this brewery puts into every beer...it tastes like they used as much chocolate as water or any other ingredient super strong flavor.  Notes: If you drink it cold it has a dry coffee type characteristic. When it warmed the chocolate was in control.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,connecticutpoet,4.62,"This was an exceedingly dark brown brew that initially had a four-finger brown head. The head slowly turned light tan, then died away over several minutes.  Aroma was of rich bitter chocolate and dark, slightly roasted malts. It was a little sweet, but not too much so.  Taste was indeed sweeter than the aroma, full of richly roasted malt, doffee notes, and hints of sweet chocolate. A very nice combination.  Mouthfeel was excellent... smooth and creamy, yet full of body.  Drinkability was exceedingly good. Although I like stouts, I am not what could be termed a stout lover... my favorite style is double IPA, so I prefer much hoppier, somewhat lighter beers... but I could have had another of these, and it was in a 22 oz. bomber.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Taste is of powdered and dark chocolate, fruit and roasted malts. Crisp and light on the palate.  Had this brew for dessert tonight. Didn't need anything else. An excellent way to end the night. I put off trying this brew for some time, mostly because I tend to take Rogue's line for granted since it's so readily available. I'm glad I finally gave it a try. Will defintely be looking for this beer in the fall.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

The flavor is full of hints of burnt malts and bittersweet chocolate. Kind of like chocolate chips. A hint of bitter hops pull through. Full bodied and a creamy silky mouthfeel. Has a semi-dry bitter-sweet aftertaste. Damn, this is a good stout. One of the best flavored stouts I have ever had.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Shultzerdugen,4.33,"22 oz. brown bomber.  Darkest inky brown with a tall, pillowy tan head. Sporadic clinging of bubbles.  Chocolate smell. Huh, it isn't just a clever name. Coffee, estery alcohol, fruits also in the nose.  Full bodied, super creamy and smooth. Surprising hints of nutmeg and cinnamon fade into a round chocolate middle. Roasted malts and coffee flavors set in in the finish, with a long lasting bready aftertaste. Hops lend earthy undertones that pair nicely.  I had the first glass by itself and the second with a slice of cherry pie, can't go wrong either way. Very nice.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,asabreed,4.84,"Bought a bomber for $4.99 and was waiting for the right, relaxed night to crack it open and sip it for over an hour. It was certainly worth the wait; even with all the hype, this is a kickass stout.  Appearance: Opaque of course, nice thick mocha-colored head. However, there wasn't much sticky lacing, which I expected (could be the glass). Also, the head dissipated quickly too (also could be the glass). Though I DID think the glass was clean. Still nice looking though, despite the absent trails of frothy goodness.  Smell: What I had hoped for. My thing with other chocolate stouts has (usually) been (though as my reviews show, some I still love) a beer that's too hoppy, or else not as balanced with creamy aromas of the many kinds of malts and sweeter ingredients. But this was totally creamy: dark and milky chocolate, real chocolate and chocolate malt mixing well, a sweet smell of powdered chocolate, slight coffee (though with cream and sugar, not bitter black coffee). Perfectly balanced and wonderful to get your nose in.  Taste: Chocolate insanity -- amazingly done. The coffee with cream and sugar aromas certainly come through, which adds an interesting twist to the powerful chocolate aromas. Not much hops flavor, though somehow it's handled without being too sweet or too overbearing. I don't see how a chocolate stout could get any better.  Mouthfeel: Silky, creamy, medium carbonation, not too thick of a body. Awesome.  Drinkability: I have to say, I wouldn't want this all the time. I would, however, like to try it with a dessert next time, as pairing this with many different things would probably make some amazing texture and flavor combinations. I'm going to get another one ASAP and save it again for another night, sipping for as long as possible.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,fisherman34,4.6,"This is easily the best chocolate beer that Ive had. Strong aromas of chocolate, along with the slightest hint of roasted coffee. The flavor is of authentic chocolate, not processed chocolate syrup, but REAL chocolate. The sweetness is well balanced by the hops and some Munich-ish malts. Id be in big trouble if I could drink this all the time!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Backer2004,3.8,"I found this one at the BP gas station for $4.00 so I said what the heck, rogue's been good to me. Then I look on the reviews and see this is Todd's highest reviewed beer ever. Some others mention that trying this should be a goal in life. Now my expectations are so much higher!  This just didn't happen. It's not even the best stout by Rogue (compared to the Shakespeare Stout). Excellent head and lacing and wonderful aroma. The taste just didn't seem like chocolate, much more mocha, coffee, and malty caramel. The warmer it gets, the better.  I still like it very much, but there's much bigger goals in life.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Brian700,4.29,This beer pours black with brown head. The head stuck around for a little while but slowly faded into a ring around my glass. The nose is amazing. It smells like chocolate mixed with maple syrup. The flavor is also very chocolatey with sort of a maple flavor thing going on in there as well. I also detect some coffee flavor. This is the best stout I have had in a long time. Great mouthfeel. Nice and creamy with a full body. Very drinkable beer. A must try.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,packetknife,4.12,"(Big) bottle with a characteristic Rogue illustration on it. Poured dark brown with a massive dense light-UPS-brown head that laced well. Organic chocholate and caramel on the nose, plenty of coffee too, something like burnt wood lingering too. Tastes just the same as it smells with the addition of one of the best feels (you just want to let it linger and caress your tongue) I've had. Given the stye I think the feel is not improvable. I can't say it's too drinkable though, although I'd certainly go for it, because it is a bit sensory overwhelming. Kinda of like the feeling I get when I have a nice Scotch with a fresh chocolate cookie.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,garymuchow,3.71,"Aroma shows a somewhat mild roasted malt that gets rounded out very subtly by the chocolate. Very attrative black with a very dark head that is thick and recedes rocky and leaves a nice heavy lace. Surprisinly bitter even with the roasty and somewhat sweet chocolate flavors. Dense. The finish gets more bitter the longer it lasts. Full feel and thick and somewhat smooth. A little oily. Overall nice. Flavor has Rogue quality, I'm assuming from the yeast. I like this, but not like others do, but it's not up to some of their other beers like Shakespeare.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,JackTheRipper,4.59,"This beer is insanely good. A: Pours an atramentous shade of midnight ('sup Gus), moderate head. I heard about the smells of this one so I poured it in an oversized wine glass to get more out of the nose, but it spread the head out too much, now just a collar.  S: How good is this! Big smell of chocolate, probably the best smelling chocolate I've ever come across. Heavy notes of roasting cocoa beans. Amazing, wonderful, lovely, seductive chocolate notes. Hints of coffee and malt round out the smells to absolute perfection. I haven't had an olfactory delight like this in years. I really have to pull myself away from the glass to take a sip.  T: More of that lovely chocolate cascades all around my mouth, inviting, caressing. Dark malts peek through followed by a big hit of hoppy bitterness. Amazing balance of flavors, everything is just right and in just the right levels. Have you ever melted a piece of Toblerone in some strong coffee? I had a drink like that in a department store in the United Arab Emirates, this beer is bringing back memories of that experience. Finish just lingers and lingers, never ending merging of chocolate sweetness and dark coffee bitterness.  M: Does the pleasure never end? This beer is very big in body, chewy and silky, rich and creamy. Carbonation level feels lower than it is, the bubbles feel like they are being buffered by the beer. Alcohol is very well masked.  D&N: I think if I ever have this on cask, I may drop dead of the sheer pleasure. I'm trying very hard to fight giving this one fives across the board, I can picture this one on cask and it haunts me. The brewers at Rogue have come up with a true masterpiece. One of the finest beers I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. This isn't beer, this is pure indulgence in liquid form. Buy this beer if you see it. Buy three. It's that good.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Smells absouletly awesome, like chocolate, obviously. Reminds me of hot chocolate, but it's cold, and beer. Smells so wonderful that I wish I could inhale it all.  Taste matches up with the smells, except a bit more dry and bitter. Nice roasted malts. Flavored with oats and chocolate, and a bit of the hops poke through. Excellent taste.  Medium carbonation, but altogether very smooth. Leaves my mouth a touch dry.  I could drink these all night, but I could see where it would be filling for some.

132,1118,diablo14,3.74,"seeing as how youngs double chocolate stout is probably my favorite beer going around, other chocolate stouts have a fair bit to live up to in my eyes. after trying the rogues interpretation, twas as i expected. not as good as youngs, but still very nice, and very american.  lovely deep brown color with a cocoa colored head which was fair to middling. some bubbling here and there but nothing too potent. this beer smelled of only one thing - chocolate. it was as tho someone had dropped a hersheys bar in my beer.it has a very rich and inviting smell, and a little dryness tickles the nose. the taste is pretty good, if a little unbalanced. starts out with smooth chocky flavors, giving way to a slightly roasted hint. silky texture up to the point the beer slams into a huge blast of bitter hops. this just didnt work for mine. the taste was slick, the hops were far too bold and agressive. they tended to take everything over, as they so often do in US beers. just didnt balance with the flavors. on this basis i wouldnt drink more than one of these at a time, and wouldnt drink it over youngs at any stage.  i still enjoyed this beer, but i think its possibly just a tad overrated. if you want a smooth chocolate stout, get youngs, if you want a big, robust and intensely hoppy stout, get shakespeare or storm king. this is somewhere inbetween, and its not so much fencesitting as trying to get the best of both worlds. in my assessment it doesnt quite work.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,futaboots,4.5,"This was one of the earliest craft beers that really hooked me into the world of better beer. Even though I've tried SEVERAL beers since then, including many American stouts, this one is still one of my favorites.  Appearance and smell. Dark as night. Modest brown head, that subsides into a nice lacing that never dissapears. Smells like dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel. Thick and creamy, just the way I like it. Is it just me, or does my glass feel heavier than usual?  Taste. If you leave this in a cold fridge for a long time, like long enough to get the temp down to slightly below 40F, you will be overwhelmed by chocolate on the first sip. 40F might be too cold for this beer, but don't worry, it warms up plenty quick, and with a 22oz bottle to work your way through, there's plenty of time and beer to get the full spectrum of flavor across several temperatures.  But basically the flavor is chocolate. Bitter roasty stout tastes are also there. This is not a sweet tasting stout by any means, there's plenty of roasted malt bitterness, backed up by hops (there's just enough to be noticed, although I heard that Rogue uses a lot in this brew), and then CHOCOLATE. Embrace the chocolate, you love it. I drank this with some very very smokey tasting marinated and grilled chicken, and it paired excellently.  Some people might give this a low drinkability score, because it's so thick and full of flavor and filling. I won't. I could drink this stuff morning, noon, and night.

Roasted grain is there, along with a little fresh roasted coffee. Finish has a hint of citrous hops with also provide subtle spice.

132,1118,woemad,4.2,"Big ass 650ml bottle from either Huckleberry's in Spokane for $4.99  Poured what appears to be pretty much midnight black, with a moderate, mocha colored head. Mocha colored lace drips dowh the glass.  Smell is very chocolaty, as one might expect. More chocolaty than the Young's Double Chocolate Stout I had the other night at The Viking. It almost seems too sweet.  Fortunately, in the taste the hops come through to keep the beer firmly grounded and not floating off into cloying land. The cohcolate comes in first, and is rather rich tasting. The hops enter the proceedings partly through, and provide a balancing dry note at the swallow. It keeps this beer in the realm of dessert beer without being too sweet. This would be great after a nice meal.  This is a relatively thick stout, somewhat viscous in the mouthfeel. I have no problem with that, but someone used to watery beers would probably be overcome.  This is an outstanding dessert beer. I feel like I should have a nice cigar around, though my bronchitis keeps that from being an option (haven't had a cigar in 4 months - no longer smoke anything else at all, yet I get bronchitis from f-ing allgergies. Doh!). This is way too sweet to have several pints, but as a one bottle per session beer, it's quite nice.

I would really like to see a nice healthy thickness on the feel. It really deserves it. Overall, not a bad brew. I find it easy drinking. The flavor is pretty darn nice.

The taste nearly lives up to the smell, begins with bitter hops that resemble a dark unsweetened chocolate, followed by a smooth malty middle and ends with a sweet milk chocolate sweetnesss that rests on the tongue along with a slight hops bitterness. A perfectly put togeather stout, one of the best stouts period and easily the best chocolate stout i've tried. Not very drinkable, 22oz is the most i could see drinking at a time and its quite filling. Goes well with any type of fine chocolate. Excellent stout, period.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Chadbrew,4.82,"This is just a beautiful espresso colored beer that only has hints of ruby around the margins of the glass when it's held up to the light. There was about a half a finger of brownish-tan head that diminishes to little islands of fluff. Really great chocolate and roasted malts, maybe a hint of cherry or plum in there too. Wow! Like the smell there is a lot of roasted malts and chocolate but with a nice hoppy bitterness and a sweet finish. The mouthfeel is great. A big thick body, it's like I'm eating a chocolate coffee cake. The drinkability is nice, a 22 oz bomber is perfect for this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,GClarkage,4.5,"04/15/05- Purchased at Belltramo's Wine and Spirits in Meno Park, CA  Presentation- Poured into my Chouffe Noel tulip. 22oz bottle with no dates.  Appearance- Very dark pour with a nice dirty 2 inch head which settled over a few minutes. Lacing was very nice as well.  Smell- Dark chocolate and a bit of toasted malt.  Taste- This has a great roasted malt flavor backed with a pretty large dark chocolate taste.  Mouthfeel- Semi-carbonated and a nice coating mouthfeel.  Drinkability- One of my top chocolate flavored stouts. Not quite as good as Stone IRS, but not that far. Quite delicious. Would be great as an after dinner dessert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,weeare138,3.95,"This one is really really good. Although, some of the reviews may be a bit on the overkill side of praising her. The appearance is murky black with constant strings of bubbles arising throughout the entire duration of the brew. Actually looks like Bosco's/Hershey's syrup when I pour the remainder into my glass. Smells of bitter chocolate all over the place with a sweet malt jumping into my nose. Definitley some semi-sweet chocolate going on about halfway through...I also like trying different chocolates! I have to say that this brew is a good one but it is sweet. There's just not a ton of balance going on as the finish is lingering all on the front of my tongue. That IS what I expected though being a chocolate stout. Feels pretty good going in and down the hatch, with some carbonation and bitter sweet chocolate tickeling the front and sides of my mouth. This was out of a 22 bomber, so I think that 1 of these would be enough for a night. It is a good one to cap the night with though.  Finger licking good!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ChrisBowers,4.02,"Pours jet black with decent head retention into a nonic pint glass. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, maybe some fruits present. Taste is quite bold, not overly complex. Just a ton of chocolate creamyness, maybe a touch of coffee and a pronounced hop finish. The hop/chocolate dynamic was an interesting one, although it very much limits this beer's drinkability in my opinion. A very good beer, though not quite as complex as I was expecting. I've had it on draft before and found that to be a much better experience. I would drink this out of the bottle again though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,3Vandoo,4.23,"A pitch black beer, that let no lights pass in. A toffee brown foamy head, and an oily body. Wee tiny bit small bubbles are present, they are so small you cant see them.  Smell of dark chocolate, hops, caramel and some fruity flavours that are shy at best.  Taste is very bitter, a great hoppish finish that beer has, some dark chocolate flavours and roasted malts are also present. It is quite different, but even me a hophead, I do thing the imbalance between the hops and the rest of the beer is not very pleasurable for long. Not a bad beer, just it doesnt go down smoothly compared to well balanced american stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,neonbrown82,4.72,"This is the single most delicious stout on the planet, and I can't believe I had almost forgotten about it. I knew there was some reason why it was the darker beers that finally made me cross over to better beers for good, even though they were never really a preferred style. This beer is very exceptional, though.  The appearance is what one would expect from any stout. Black to the very core, not even showing a ruby highlight when held up to the light also accompanied by a chocolatey foam cap which quickly recedes to a ring. The smell is typical stout, but one thing is different: chocolate (obviously). It smells like a cup of hot cocoa after a long snow shoveling session. I never thought I would catch myself saying this as spring is just now underway, but if only it were winter again... just for this very moment. The taste is very chocolatey as well, and supported by a nice roasted barley flavor. Back when I used to drink this religiously, my palate was not developed enough to truly appreciate this beer. My tastebuds are now worthy of such a fine brew, and I will once again be picking this up regularly.  edit: I ended up mixing the second half of this bomber with the second half of the Rogue Chipotle Ale I just reviewed as well for a Molé Black & Tan. It was good, but I think I liked this beer better on its own, as the smokiness of the chipotle ale tends to overpower the chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RedDiamond,4.54,"The bartender asked if I was having any food. Just a beer, I said. Make it the chocolate stout. Hey, he says, beer is food, especially that beer.  Hes right. This is food. And Im glad I gave this one a second chance because my first effort from a 22 oz. bottle was rather ho-hum. On tap, the chocolate stout is hell yeah.  Rogues Chocolate Stout may be thought of as a double chocolate stout; its made with both chocolate malt and actual chocolate. In this case Rogue opted to put the chocolate where it belongs; not as a shy condiment, but as a full-term partner boldly defining the flavor from start to finish. The nose is dry, chocolaty, and profound. Likewise, the chocolate flavor washes across the palate with expressive authority. As the more beerish elements recede, the chocolate remains to define the finish. Its a finish worth lingering over.  Prior to drinking this beer Id only known much tamer versions of the style such as Youngs. Im thankful for Rogues success in convincing me that chocolate stout is a meritorious concept. Id previously been skeptical that the temporal sugars of grain maltose fermented in a dark beer could successfully intermix with the tropic sensuality of tart cacao. But it works. It works exceedingly well.  This is an artistic and imaginative beer whose exotic properties are neither shy nor misplaced.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,MrSeth,4.03,"Poured with a gorgeous chocolate colored head of a modest size with lacing reluctantly hanging onto the glass. Looks very attractive.  There is chocolate in the aroma, creamy milk chocolate. Earthy undertones.  The taste is smooth chocolaty, earthy, with a few rough edges around the chewy oat flavor.  For the mouthfeel, I found this stout almost watery in consistency. It is a kind of refreshing effect.. but I'm not sure if I could get used to a stout that is this thin. But on a hot summer night this may be the right choice for a stout.  .",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jlh8643,4.42,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. The brew developed a nice dark tan head that dropped down to a very fine cap after about 5 minutes. Coffee, chocolate, dark roasted malts wafted from the glass. Chocolate and roasted malts dominated the initial sip with a nice balance of hops. Swirl the aroma around in the mouth and I can still taste the chocolate, roasted malts and some oatiness too. Slightly dry on the finish. I really enjoyed this brew very much and plan on getting some more in the future.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,beertastegood,3.83,"Pours a beautiful pitch black with a great big dark tan head. Smells a lot sweeter than I expected, like high quality hot cocoa mix. Burnt coffee and malt aromas as well. Tastes like cocoa beer! A very prominent chocolate flavor dominates at first, then fades into a bitter coffee flavor. Finish is dry, with a slight chocolate aftertaste. This beer is a little heavy on the sweetness, but as it is a chocolate stout, that is not to be counted against it. Reminds me of a more in-your-face version of Young's Double Chocolate. As a novelty, I did enjoy this brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,karst,4.9,"Pours black with a rich tan head to die for. Chocolate aroma dominates. Burnt bitter taste eddy in a river of chocolate that flows from chocolate mountains. Great beer to end a tasting session. It could not get much better. Not embarrassed to stand behind the high marks. Why the ""low"" drinkability rating? I noticed that I was getting more than my 1/4 share. Joe, Derek, and Dave thanks for a nice evening with five craft brews ending with this standout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,travolta,4.23,"Apperance: black with a tan head. Head form and retention was like a root beer float. Rocky and thick.  Nose: Milk chocolate, creamy vanilla bean  Taste: Spring greens, earthy, oats, lite sweet chocolate, smotth truffle.  Notes: This was a very good stout. I love the chocolate as being an aftertaste. This chocolate was not over powering, but right where it needs to be. I was not impressed with the price, but I was impressed with the quality and taste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,whartontallboy,4.35,"Deep black pour with a tight thick head of dark brown bubbles. Head retains pretty well before eventually dissipating. Smell is sweet with some dark chocolate and just a little bit of hoppiness to go along with the big roasted malts. Flavor is roasted malt with a lot of chocolate, but it's different from most chocolate stouts I've had. The addition of the real chocolate seems to give it a feel that doesn't taste like cocoa powder was poured in after the beer was brewed. It's deliciously complex and tasty and not at all cloyingly sweet. The Cascade hops are always there in each sip and tie everything together nicely. I might not want more than a bomber of this in a sitting, but it's delicious! Head and shoulders above all of the other chocolate stouts out there...if this one didn't cost so much, I think I'd drink it all the time.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,HogHill,4.44,"This bomber poured into my Stone Imperial Stout glass, a dark brown, with a thin tan head which left lacing around the rim. Smells of cocoa, like a Giradelli Hot Chocolate but only a Stout! Taste is similar to the aroma, lots of chocolate and dark malts, there is a good deal of hops on the finish (69 IBUs). Mouthfeel is reminiscent of other stouts, a bit creamy and not overly carbonated. I don't know what the ABV is here, but I'll guess it's around 6%, and even though some would think a chocolate stout is pushing the novelty envelope, it is indeed very drinkable. I enjoyed this with a bowl of vanilla ice cream on top of a banana, delish! Highly recommended, nice job Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Gaisgeil,4.38,"A very nice stout! This is probably the best brew I've had from Rogue overall.  Pours a deep and rich black with a thin dark brown head that fizzles into nothing after a bit but leaves a bit of a crown throughout. Smell is of dark chocolate, sweet and creamy smelling, malty, maybe a bit of cherry or molasses in the background. Taste follows suit but adds a bit of a coffee flavor along with a certain almost dairy flavor. A bit bitter, but in a good way I think.  Overall I'm very impressed!

132,1118,carln26,4.35,"Dark brown in color with a creamy light brown head. As you would expect with the name on the beer this has very definitive chocolate notes in the aroma. Dark chocolate covered cherries rise from the beer. Mild roast malt and a light flowery hop note accent the finish. Wow, powerful chocolate flavor up front, followed quickly by a light hop bitterness. Maybe a little too bitter. The richness lent by the malt up front doesnt balance as well with the hop here. Great velvety mouth feel, still very drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,crookedhalo,4.05,"Pours an opaque deep brown color with a growing chocolate milk colored head leaving nice lacing as the head subsides. Delicate aroma of chocolate amongst black patent and chocolate malts, a touch of oat and a decent hop aroma (for a stout). Almost too chocolatey. Roasted barley scorchiness helps alleviate this stout from being too distracting with chocolate. Decent dryness in the finish from the hops. Nicely balanced between chocolatey sweetness and the drier finish. Subtle carbonation works well. On its own, a solid stout, the addition of chocolate makes it a bit more luxurious and exotic. I'm not really even a big fan of chocolate, but this stout is great. No synthetic chocolate taste whatsoever.

The chocolate isn't sweet either, it has that imported smell to it, and i'm sure it'll have that imported taste as well. Malts also show up, along with a touch of coffee, cocoa, and earth tones.  Taste started out with a ton of chocolate along with some roasted malts. The roasted malts seemed to get stronger and stronger towards the end. Some dark fruit and coffee show up as an underlying to the chocolate and malts.  Mouthfeel was medium. It was very smooth, rich, and creamy. Very nice.

It smells like chocolate. There are hints of rosted malts, but the chocolate is the dominant aroma. This beer smells stronger of chocolate than any beer I have ever had. It tastes like chocolate. I cant really say any more about that. It tastes like carbonated, slightly malty chocolate. It goes down smooth. This beer is easy to drink. The carbonation is just right. I think that this beer is very good. However, I think that the strong chocolate flavor might become a little bit much after a few pints. If you havent tried this beer, you need to. Soon.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,blitz134,4.2,"Black hole colored if I must say so with no light transmission. I do believe light is actually being sucked into this beer. There was ample brown head to begin with which reduced to barely a coating. Aroma was of toffee with hits of tootsie rolls and expresso. Flavors of ample toasted malts and a touch of smoke. Chocolate is definately a major player in this beer. There was also an unexpected touch of slightly citrus hops coming through. Almost like that orange flavored chocolate you get around the holidays. And at the very end was a tiny amount of coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel was thinner than I expected, not really heavy at all. This is a good after-dinner beer that I'd gladly have a couple of and will revist again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,sinistermadman,4.45,"Rogue brews some really good stuff, but this is my first time trying this stout. I am usually put off by flavored brews so we'll see how this goes.  Pours a deep, dark brown which emanates a very creamy caramel nut colored head.  Hints of chocolate malts are evident in the smell. Doesn't smell overly sweet, but rather earthy and deep.  First taste can be summed up in one word, chocolate. Not a overbearing sort of chocolate, but a kind of bitter non-sweet kind. Very balanced. Very crisp and quite refreshing. The chocolate tone is kept in check with oaty goodness. This stout is quite tasty. I am surprised that this stout is as drinkable as it is.  Drinkability is excellent. Definitely a dessert beer, although this could work pretty well in a session lineup in my opinion.  In summary a stout which defies logic in obtaining a non-intrusive but very rich flavor all the while not trading off on the drinkability factor.

132,1118,Pegasus,4.42,"Appearance: Utterly black with a thick and dense tan head, which retains well. The lacing is thick and glass-coating.  Aroma: Deep notes of bitter chocolate utterly dominate the aroma. There are lesser toasted malt notes as well. The superb arom makes it tempting to serve this in a goblet, to retain as much of the aroma as possible.  Taste: Bitter chocolate and alcohol dominate the flavor profile from start to finish. Subtle fruit notes are present in the middle, offering a brief chocolate-covered fruit flavor. There is a lingering coffee-like bitterness towards the finish, which lingers well beyond the end of the taste.  Mouth feel: Quite smooth and full, a little soft carbonation on the tongue, dry at the finish.  Drinkability/note: Unwaveringly excellent, complex, and difficult to overrate, no less than superb.

A moderate brown (not tan, brown) head that starts strong and vigorous, but drops fairly quickly.  Aroma- well, I guess I must say it. Chocolate. Sweet, medium milk chocolate- but fairly rich. Not bitter strong chocolate. And to be honest, I can't smell anything else.  Flavor- rich, malty, dark bready, with obvious chocolate overtones. But the hops keep this from going to far into the realm of chocolate milk- it pulls it back a notch. Pretty tasty, but more hops than I expect.  Mouthfeel- full and creamy, can't ask for much more.  Overall a good beer, worth re-visiting. I'm starting to try Rogue's selections, and I am enjoying them.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Stubbie1,4.12,"As all stouts do this one also pours a dark coffee color. A tan head meets the top of the glass and hangs for a spell then leaves no trace. Aroma of semi-sweet chocolate is dominate nothing more and nothing less. The taste was a surprise, I thought it would be over done as some other chocolate type brews but this was well balanced with the chocolate flavor. It was not as sick sweet but a bitter sweet. Maybe the malt and hops used blended this well. Bottom line enjoyable but too much chocolate could drive me nuts after awhile so I couldnt put this as a session brew but definitely in the desert category. If you have had other chocolate brews and did not care for themtry this one from Rogue, it may change your mind.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Mouthfeel is very full and creamy with a nice overall texture.  A very drinkable stout from Rogue!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mgdeth,4.47,"Appearance - Black color, with a light brown, rocky head (the same as Shakespeare Stout, which is as it should be, because this beer appears to be identical to Shakespeare except for the chocolate flavoring). Head retention is good.  Smell - Chocolate aroma is abundantly present. It is difficult to describe how good this beer smells - sweet, chocolatey, with maybe some roastiness in the background.  Taste - The chocolate flavor is well-pronounced, but it is not overdone. The roastiness present in Shakespeare shows up here as well, but it is more subdued. I only detect hop bitterness in the aftertaste. The chocolate/roasted coffee aftertaste lingers for a while.  Mouthfeel - This beer seems thick and rich, and makes a very fine stout. Satisfying.  Drinkability - This is a beer you have to nurse because it is so complex and heavy on flavor. Not for the faint of heart.  Comments - This is a pretty incredible beer.

Taste is bittersweet cocoa / chocolate (reminds me of the cocoa powder made by Droste) some sweetness then coffee/cappuccino with a long dry finish.  Medium bodied, hard to believe you could pack all that flavor into such modest bodied brew.  Oy Vey, this is one special glass of stout.

132,1118,shirfan,4.16,"Completely opaque, pitch black, with a thick and long-lasting layer of fine tan bubbles. ""Lacing"" is an understatement, this leaves an entire sheet along the inside of the glass.  Aroma: Leather, dark chocolate, ice cream parlor, hershey's syrup, old books.  Taste: More dark chocolate, chocolate syrup chocolate, chewy dark malt without a burnt aspect. Frothy latte notes before a not-overdone amount of citric hops takes over. Balanced well; no one flavor tries to outmuscle the others. Not a trace of alcohol burn.  Smooth mouthfeel...it's tempting to think it's on the thin side, but actually just subtle and well-crafted.

Taste and Mouthfeel: A chocolate sweet taste is all there is. And that's a good thing. Sweey, sticky, and syrupy. The hops are there, but not strong. It's all about chocolate malts here. And loads of them. In the mouth it's not as creamy as I'd hoped.  Drinkability and Overall: Excellent. Simply excellent. A true classic that will bring your taste buds alive.

Lacing goes beyong what I consider normal, there are actually multiple layers of lace-rings that cling till' the end-spectacular! -Aroma bursting with sweet, roasty choc. malt, cappucino, faint plum, and piney hops. -Tastes soooo much better that bottled version. Huge bittersweet chocolate and coffee notes followed by carmalized sweetness and a lingering piney hop bite. Like a big, creamy glass of chocolate cake.

132,1118,koolk,4.5,"US Trip Aug-Dec 04  Deep and dark and brooding black with hints of brown. Head was fluffy and dark tan. Steady carbonation.  Wow, nothing but choc on the initial sniff...dark melted sweet sexy chocolate...yum! On closer inspection there are some traces of hops and some roasty grainy notes, but that chocolate kicks all of their arses.  Again on the palate the choc dominates but the more 'stouty' flavours come through - roast/toast malts and some green leafy flavours. Well balanced (bitter sweet flavours worked well together) and incredible round and drinkable, this is a ripper of a chocolate stout.  Wow, another killer from Rogue, this boys are doing some great things.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,skybluewater,3.57,"Pours a pitch-black color. Smells like a big chunk of chocolate. Tastes of (what else) chocolate, but is also quite hoppy, as per usual with a Rogue brew.  Overall, not a bad beer, just waaay too much to drink in one sitting (I'd settle for 6 or 7 oz once in a while). I doubt I'd buy again, unless I have someone to share with (which isn't likely...).",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,oxmasterscream,4.32,"Appearance: Thick, creamy-looking, tan head sitting atop a deep black-brown ale. Like a giant espresso. Exactly how it should look.  Smell: Deep, dark and sweet chocolate. The most chocolate I've ever smelled in a beer. A hint of spicy hops. As a chocolate lover, I could smell it all day. I want a candle that smells like this.  Taste: A full-flavored balance of burnt malts and bittersweet chocolate. Finish starts with a sharp shot of grapefruit and then a wicked, bittering that lasts and lasts and lasts. Good stuff.  Mouth: Syrupy and prickly. Full bodied and smooth, like melted chocolate. Just great.  Drinkability: It's always nice to taste a stout that's full-flavored like an imperial but lacks the high ABV so that it can be drunk endlessly. Try one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,dgallina,4.72,"Pours black with mahogany highlights and thick tan head which leaves good lace along the glass. Smells of very strong coffee malts, chocolate malts, and actual chocolate backed with hop spice. Flavor is a lovely balance of coffee malts, bitter-sweet chocolate, and cascade hops. Mouth-feel is soft and chewy, but relatively drinkable for a beer this heavy. Extremely appetizing as a desert beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,hero27,3.37,"Appearance: 22-ounce bomber. Dark, dark brown in color..very opaque. Very thin brown head even with a vigorous pour.  Smell: Nice smell of roasted coffee and obvious chocolate aroma.  Taste: Tastes strongly of dark chocolate and very apparent roasted flavor. The roasted malts are good, but maybe a little too much? I dunno, the taste just let me down a little given the other offerings I've had from Rogue. I didn't like the combination of bitter coffee and chocolate in this one and didn't enjoy the aftertaste. I think without the coffee bitterness, I would have enjoyed the taste a lot more.  Mouthfeel: Decent carbonation from this one, but the body is definitely fairly full. Soft, creamy finish.  Drinkability: The thick body and full flavors make this one beer you won't be drinking in large quantities.  Overall, I think other Rogues have spoiled me, because this didn't live up to my expectations like I hoped it would. Either way, I recommend it because it is still a great, very tasty chocolate stout...just not exactly to my taste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,GreenWBush,4.01,"Impenetrable black with an ovaltene head. Lace sticks with the glass at every swallow documenting your progress.  Nose is heady chocolate built by hints of toffee, dark chocolate, artificial vanilla.  The taste rings off like a chocolate coffee drink due to the heavy influence of the cascades, though in my particular sample bitterness was the hop's main contribution. I cannot help but be reminded of a hot fudge sundae.  The heavy viscocity might hurt the drinkability a bit, but truly this beer is a liquefied chocolate bar, and not of the dirty American stepchild variety. A chocoholic's dream.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,zacharius,3.72,"This beer comes in a bottle with a silkscreened drawing of some person on it, pretty lame artwork in my opinion. Oh well I don't have to look at the bottle, I'll just look at a club magazine instead.  This beer pours a dark brown color with a frothy tan head. Smell is of roasted malts and intense chocolate. The smell is really great but I was dissapointed by the lack of chocolate in the taste. It was sweet, malty with some hops and there was a slight chocolate flavor but nothing like I expected from the aroma. Nice thick bodied beer, like a glass of chocolate milk. Excellent drinkablity, definately a session beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,baiser,4,"Black and thick, with a creamy brown head. Aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malt, some coffee. Taste was roasty, dark bitter chocolate. Somewhat smokey, somewhat sweet. After taste was a nice milky unsweetened chocolate flavour. Full bodied, yet surprisingly easy to drink. Just delicious.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Rastacouere,3.61,"Pitch black pour. Rather long-lasting big tan head. Rich malty aroma reminiscent of chocolate milk, smarties, vanilla. Definitely reminds me of smarties... Gets a bit too tart (citric and lactic) to be extremely enjoyable to me, but as far as sweet stouts go, Ive rarely encountered better. I guess Id just love it more would another less citric hop replace those astringent cascades. Well made nutty bitter finish counters the heavy sweetness, although it tastes more like bitter black chocolate. Gets roastier and roastier as it warms, like burnt chocolate. Good full body, oatmealish, velvety.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,SaunaKing,4.52,"Looks like chocoalte, smells like chocolate and tastes like chocolate. My first chocolate stout and I was amazed how this beer really does taste like chocolate. The beer is almost black - a very dark brown with a tan leather head that did not last long but left lots of lacing on the glass. Rich, strong smell of chocoate and the taste is a tart chocolate with a hint of coffee. A smooth mouthfeel and pretty drinkable for such a unique tasting beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DrJay,4.42,"Very dark brown beer, nearly black, with no highlights. Dense, creamy, tan head that persists and really sticks to the sides of the glass. Chocolate and rich toffee aroma, almost butterscotch, with some roastiness and a light alcohol smell. Very smooth, creamy texture. Rich chocolate flavour with burnt and roasted maltiness in a support role. Flavours are quite well-balanced. Alcohol is just at the edge of taste perception, but does cause a slight warming on its way down. Light hop bitterness appears at the finish, but doesn't overpower the malt and chocolate. Carbonation assists the creamy texture with tiny bubbles mixing well with the full-bodied beer.  Brown 650 mL bottle, freshness code on rear label.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,FormatKid,4.42,"I poured this beer out of the silk-screened bomber into a standard pint glass. The body of this looks nicely dense on the pour and its just about as black as any other big stout Ive seen before. The head is surprisingly light, sort of a very light tan. That sucker is immobile for a long time though, it hangs tougher than the new kids. Big fat clumps of foamy lace cling to the glass as the liquid descends down my glass. The aroma is very inviting, roasty, nutty and not surprisingly a big fat dollop of milk chocolate. The flavor reminds me of a really nice stout mixed with chocolate milk, its that chocolatey. The flavor is predominately charred malt and soft, chewy milk chocolate, the cascade hops put their foot down a bit in the finish and after-taste but arent quite as assertive here as I perceive them in some of Rogues other beers. The mouthfeel is an even medium Id say and the carbonation lightens the perception. This is a damn fine beer, and Ive never tasted this much chocolate in any other beer before.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Sammy,4.18,"Dark and thick, very roasty. Not in aroma, but certainly in solid and smooth stout. Rolled oats provide body and sweetness to otherwise semi-bitter chocolate.. Very drinkable. Very natural and well rounded, not sweet nor bitter. Nicely hopped. RIch medium-full mouthfeel.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Viggo,4.58,"Although this beer was pricy, ($5.65 CDN for a 650 ml bottle) it was one that I had to try. I was not disappointed in the least. It poured a nice dark brown bordering on black, with a thick and creamy light brown head. The smell is roasted malt and a sweet coffee-like aroma. The taste is amazing, like an alcoholized mix of rich chocolate milk and espresso. The finish is like a piece of bittersweet chocolate melting down the throat. Mouthfeel is very smooth and nice a nice sweet/bitter flavour sticks around for a while. I really enjoyed this beer, and will definitely be purchasing it again soon.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,orbitalr0x,4.5,"Pours from the bomber a beautiful black with a nice dark tan head. I can't see through this and holding it up to the light doesn't help much. This is as dark as night. The smell is of roasted, burnt malts with a healthy dose of chocolate on the nose. Hops are subdued in the mix..smells like some freshly baked brownies. This is my dessert after a nice dinner.  The first taste is quite complex. A nice mix of floral hops and roasted, nutty malts intertwines with what I would say is the perfect amount of bitersweet chocolate flavor. Damn..this is one tasty brew. Almost tastes like some fine dark chocolate to me, maybe a hint of coffee in there as well. This is quite well balanced and easy to drink. Sweetness is there but is counteracted with a nice does of biterness.  The mouthfeel is good and it goes down smoothly. Drinkability is right up there as well. It tates so good I just want to keep downing it. Forget the cake, pie, cookies or anything else...after a fine meal serve some Rogue Chocolate Stout instead.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Phyl21ca,3.67,"Bottle: Poured a pitch black stout with a medium brownish head with better then average retention. I was quite surprised at the hoppy aroma with light chocolate/ roasted coffee notes. I guess my expectation (because of the name) were to find real discernable chocolate taste, instead I feel that the overabundance of hops covered the chocolate with a lingering bitterness. A bit more sweet and chocolate taste would have been a better representation of what to expect of a chocolate stout. Nonetheless, this is a very good stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,IronDjinn,4.1,"Sampled while in Vegas. Poured from a 650 ml brown bottle, silk-screened label. A pitch black body, blocks out the light. Large creamy tan head. Intense chocolate aroma with faint hops. Sweet milk chocolate flavour, with dry coffee, balanced out with the cascade hops. Smooth mouthfeel, effervescent and somewhat light. Not necessarily a session ale, but one that's worth picking up on a regular basis.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,CAMRAhardliner,3.93,"Pours the prerequisite opaque black of a good stout, topped with a nice rocky tan head coats the glass with lace. The aroma is overwhelmingly of milk chocolate with a nice hoppiness (both bitter and aroma). The taste starts out with plain Cadburys, then dark chocolate, resinous mollases and oats take over. A very capable hop bitterness is detectable. The finish is sweet, of more milk chocolate, but definitely not too sweet like some stouts (caribean, Im looking your way). The mouthfeel is creamy and slightly slick with lots of soft carbonation evident.  This is a very good stout that tastes like actual chocolate. One criticism I have is that the chocolate taste is a little too dominant. It has very little roasted barley flavor. Young's Double Chocolate Stout is definitely a more balanced beer.  *note* One really cool thing about this beer is theres a residue left in the bottom of the glass thats like the stuff you see in a Quick chocolate milk mix. It might be yeast but it really tastes like chocolate. This beer is totally made with real chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TerryW,4.5,"Well, for me this is one of those died and gone to heaven beers. I put it in the fridge to chill it out and the anticipation just about kills me.  Dark when poured, firm good sized head, laces nicely. Good looking beer.  Smells and tatses magnificent. Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Sweet and delicious on the nose, a little syrupy maybe, but chocolate. Earthy and dark, smooth and full of flavour. Chocolate. Malt, coffee, some burnt chrcteristics.  An excellent marriage of chocolate and beer. Worth every penny. Tasty and well crafted. Go buy a couple and be prepared to enjoy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

This beer is phenomenal is every aspect of the sense. The 22oz bomber is a godsend. This poured out a beautiful pitch black with fluffy tan head that resembled that of a root-beer float. The smell had definate hints of chocolate that just teased the senses. That first sip got my motor-neurons running 100 mph. The sweet taste of chocolate was followed by a little burnt taste and the combinate was spectacular.

Deep brown with a puffy tan head, looked good but didn't look so special, but smelled like a Hershey's Special Dark, or the bags of chocolate chips I used to steal from the kitchen cupboard. Ultra creamy fabulous semi-sweet chocolate malts with a lightly citrusy hopped coffee finish. Goes down crazy smooth with great lacing all the way. Superb.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,pootz,3.98,"22oz bomber from the LCBO. Date code stated it was well within freshness peak. Served at 43deg.F in a thick English pint glass.  The pour revealed a black stout that allows no light through the glass. Lovely frothy chocolate colored cap... mild to medium carbonation. Nose is predominated with sweet spicy cocoa tones with some must from the oats lemony hops were just barely detectable.  Mouth feel is big with sturdy malty/oat body and predominated by distinct chocolate tastes balanced against grassy hops that mildly bitter the cocoa flavor in the surprisingly silky, light (for a stout) finish.Taste not unreminisant of liquid semisweet baker's chocolate. A very tasty stout and very drinkable ( I usually dont value stout for easy smooth dinkability).  I like this stout....would recommend it and actually prefer it to St. Ambroise Oatmeal stout. One tip: when you pour this from the large bottle, leave 2 fingers in the bottle...swirl it then pour this into your glass...there is quite a bit of delicious oat and cocoa sediment on the bottom that really aids in the smoothness of the finish.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RenoZymurgist,3.99,"22 oz. Bomber with a chick holding a mug of Stout on the front. Poured a black brew with a deep brown head that didn't last long. The aroma is fairly mild with hints of roasted grains, chocolate, and herbal hops. The flavor is exceptional as this stout has a sweetness in the beginning just as chocolate itself has a sweet creamy inital flavor, while the beer then segues to a nice chocolate finish matched by roasted malt flavors. The mouthfeel is excellent in regards to carbonation but i believe that the body is a bit light. Very drinkable with spicy foods as an excellent contrast of flavors as the Stout cuts through the heat of the dish for the brief time that it is on your tongue then after you swallow the heat is back.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,yankeeheel,4.23,"Pours a deep, beautiful, ink black with a rather active espresso colored head. Maximal lacing and good retention. Smells overtly of chocolate and coffee. This is shaping up nicely. Taste wise it is a home run. Huge waves of coffee, slightly burnt, and chocolate malt enbalm your mouth. This stuff is desert and that's just how I'm having it. Finshes slightly dry with a nice sweetly astringent quality to it. Mouthfeel is rather big but quite enjoyable. God help me if I ever find this on tap.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,HiroProtagonist,4.72,"Rogue Chocolate Stout was served from a 22 oz. silkscreened bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was black, and was topped by an ample brown head that eventually receeded, leaving pools of shimmering obsidian-like blackness. Rich aromas of cocoa-chocolate, cola, and creamy sasparilla wafted from the glass, integrated with a superb and intriguing roasty smoky earthiness. This stout delivered divine flavors...beginning with a dark chocolate-cola roasty maltiness that opened up with an excellent earthy cocoa bitterness and perfectly subtle non-descript esters. The finish was cocoa dry and cola-like with cherry esters, leaving lingering bitter chocolate notes. Yes I could tell there is some real chocolate in there. The body was richly full and smooth: perfect for the flavors and character of the beer. I was very impressed with the Chocolate Stout, enjoying it immensely, in contrast to the Shakespeare, which I think is a bit unrefined and out-of-wack with its esters. Being a lover of both stouts and super dark chocolate, I highly recommend this one to other like-minded individuals. Perhaps my favorite from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,99bottles,4.45,"Appearance: The beer has a dark brown-black body, completely opaque, and is topped with an inch of dark tan foam. Good head retention, a 1/2"" stays the entire time.  Smell: This has a wonderfully rich nose of cocoa powder and lightly roasted malt; only the most faint touch of bitterness in the nostrils.  Taste: This is pure decadence. A well balanced malt profile gives this a rounded flavor, not an astringent one. Rich dark malts combine nicely with real chocolate? to elicit the cocoa flavor in the nose, and even a sweet coffee liquer flavor. So smooth and chocolately. Mmmm. Even though I don't match beer with desert, this could convince me otherwise. Roasted bitterness creeps in to finish, and keeps one honest.  Mouthfeel: Very nice, not thick and viscous like an Imperial, but not flimsy and weak like a dry stout. Just right.  Drinkability: I'd gladly have more than one. Delicious. I'm very happy to have found it on tap in my neck of the woods.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bultrey,4.27,"Wow. Wow. That's all I can say. I had this on tap in a 20 oz. glass at Spuyten Duyvil. Beer brewed with actual chocolate, as this one is, scares me. I don't think of it as a natural combination (except for maybe some good dark chocolate with a malty barleywine). The chocolate is incredibly aggressive in the aroma, making for one of the most unsual and delicious smelling beers ever. But again, I'm thinking ""I don't want to taste this, just smell it."" Well, I was wrong. The chocolate is there in the taste, but not nearly as aggressive as in the aroma, and it is quickly balanced by smooth, dark roasted malt with some nice hoppiness on the edge. The beer finishes cleaner than any stout I've ever had, as the chocolate shows up again in the aftertaste, more in the form of vanillin, perfectly balancing out the roastiness. Mouthfeel is smooth, smooth, smooth. One might classify this as a dessert beer, but I think not one to accompany dessert; rather, it IS dessert. Sublime.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BuckeyeNation,4.89,"Darkest mahogany. I would call it ebony but I get the sense that there's a reddish tint when the glass is held up to bright sunlight. The generous head is toasted cocoa brown in color, tight-bubbled and semi-firm. It looks like it might be an impressive lacer, but despite maintaining a thick creamy disk, there isn't a lot of glass coverage. A short collar and a few small scraps is it.  There's an undercurrent of dark, roasted malt and citric hops, but the nose is dominated by an enticing, liqueur-like, bittersweet chocolatiness. It smells like an entire bottle of Hershey's syrup was added to the bomber. This is, without question, the most chocolatey nose of any beer that I've ever had. Wow, a beer milkshake!  My impressions after tasting are nearly identical to my impressions after smelling. Sure, you have your roasted black malt and your trademark Rogue hoppiness (Cascade in this case), but man oh man, the sweet, silky, liquid chocolate goodness is exploding over my tongue and is lingering seemingly forever.  The carbonation is under the radar stealthy, which only improves the smooth, impossibly creamy texture. It isn't full and chewy like an Imperial stout, but it really doesn't need to be for maximum enjoyability. This is one amazing beer.  When I saw that Rogue added natural chocolate flavoring (the front of the silk-screened bottle says ""made with imported chocolate"") I was all set to put on my beer snob hat, invoke purity laws and say things like 'why couldn't they make it taste like chocolate using only roasted malt, etc.' That was before I tasted it.  I don't care what they added to make it taste this delicious, I just hope they keep on brewing it. If ever there was a chocolate beershake, this is it. If that strikes some as heresy then I'll gladly consume their share. Rogue Chocolate Stout is, in my opinion, the definitive chocolate stout and the one by which all others will now be measured. Tremendous stuff!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

Aromas are of roasted malts, coffee, cocoa, and just a slight light hop aroma. The intially taste of this beer starts off quite roasty and chocolately with the dark malts really finding their way into this brew. This follows with a nice coffee tone with hints of expresso and just more cocoa. This beer finishes smooth and thick, with a nice hop bitterness and yet more roasty malts.

You really have to hunt for it at first. After a while it seems a little more present, but you'd think there would be more to it. A decent stout. I wonder what the ""natural chocolate flavoring"" is.  This bottle was courtesy of frank4sail, who brought it (amongst many others) to Belgium for me.

It's interesting to note that in Summer of 2003 the American Museum of Natural History in NYC had an exhibit on chocolate, and this beer was offered for sale in the gift-shop!  Served in a pint glass. Beer was nearly black with little head. The aroma of chocolate was immediately evident. chocolate bars don't smell this chocolately. Sweet aroma and a slight hop backbone were detected. Taste was outstanding. Off the tap this beer had a totally different characteristic than in bottles.

Aroma first and foremost is of nice dark bitter chocolate. Then under that I notice a damp chewing tobacco (which I do not use, so it may just be an impression) and vanilla oil.  Taste is a good match for the smell and I have dark chocolate followed by a mellow malt and finally a tangy medium hop finish. In there somewhere I get a campfire roasted marshmellow also. Taste stays in the mouth for minutes after each drink.  I like the mouthfeel, but it could be a little better if the middle palate was a little shorter, bowing to a longer fore-palate. Either way I will say that this is a great mouthfeel beer, just not perfect.  Drinkability for me is good, I couldn't turn this into a ""session beer"" but I don't really do too many of those anymore. This is a wonderful dessert beer, campfire beer and general tounge pleaser.

Head retention is good and it leaves a nice brown lacing about the glass. The aroma coming of this one is of heavy chocolate with a slight floral hoppiness mingling about. Some coffee can also be detected in the smell. The taste was excellent all the great qualities of a stout were present with the taste of dark chocolate. It seems the coffee flavor can out on the backside as an after taste; also there was some bitterness present. Mouthfeel was full bodies and creamy.

132,1118,PudTinkler,5,"Holy sweet mother of God...this is the finest beer I've had. The color is borderline black..deep and beautiful. The head is caramel-colored but doesn't last long...the scent is a fantastic combo of chocolate with the slightest hint of coffee (or toffee?)... The taste is what blows me away....sweet, yet still has the strong ""stout"" feel to it. I give this beer the highest ratings I possibly can.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Billolick,4.17,"Bomber bottle, pours black and rich, engine oil. Heady nose of chocolate and expresso. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Notes of expresso, cholcoate, chocolate cake. This stuff is just plain yummy. Great dessert beer, great for a night capper. Classy product from a long time major player in the craft brew market. Thanks Rogue..",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ViveLaChouffe,4.38,"Pours pitch black with a huge deep brown head. Some lace but not alot. Smells of chocolate and cappucino.  Taste is overwhelmingly of dark chocolate. And bitter coffee as you might expect. But there is another dimension to this beer and that's the sweet milkiness that reminds you of a milk stout. Mixed with the chocolate/coffee bitterness, the creaminess lends a bittersweet quality to this brew. Again, a creamy mouthfeel with a nice bitter finish. But still very smooth. Really luscious and easy to drink. Fantastic stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,HochFliegen,4.45,This beer was as dark as the dark chocolate bar it tastes like. The head is a tan color. The head slowly turns to a thin layer of bubbles that didnt really lace the glass as much as I thought it would.(could be due to glass at bar) The smell was huge. Lots of chocolate and coffee in the aroma. Also very smooth and sweet maltiness. The taste is dominated by toffe and a slight bitterness at first and in the end leaves a massive burst of dark chocolate that lingers and coats the mouth.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,PCaravan,4.65,"Appearance: It is as black as any beer I've poured and the head is definitely the darkest I've seen though it does not stick around. It's intense color gives pretence to what is to come.  Smell: The smell is not intense but is rich in dark chocolate and malt.  taste: There's no beer that taste as much like a bar of dark chocolate as this one. Would be great as an after dinner dessert. This beer actually has a generic description of ingredients on the side of the bottle. I lost a little respect for the beer when I saw it at 'chocolate flavoring' even it was imported. It works really well but I would have been much more impressed if the flavor profile was achieved with malt and traditional adjuncts (like roasted barley) alone.  mouthfeel: It was a little over carbonated for my taste for a stout but it was smooth and silky... like an oatmeal stout, really cool.  drinkability: This is definitely an enjoyable brew from start to finish and would buy it again. Would work exceptionally well as an after dinner drink in smaller portions. It's not something you'd want to quaff several glasses of unless you're really into chocolate. Too bad I've only seen Rogue Chocolate Stout in 650ML bottles.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Hagbard,3.76,"Black as night with a very thin, dark tan head, this beer even looks like chocolate. The smell is sweet, dark malts, but I can't really pick up any chocolate aroma specifically. Oddly, the more I smell it, the less smell my nose picks up. As the beer slides onto the tongue, the initial taste is sweet and malty. The chocolate doesn't assert itself until after it has sat on the tongue for a bit and you're ready to swallow. At that point, it really rears back and smacks...makes you think you have a piece of dark chocolate in your mouth. I detect a slight metallic taste in the aftertaste, which is ever-so-slightly off-putting. Drinkability suffers for me as it becomes almost sickingly sweet by the end fo the glass. An 8 or 9 oz. serving would be ideal as an after-dinner drink, but a 22 oz. bomber is just too much.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,dauss,4.73,Pours a beautiful and pitch black color. Fairly large dark tan head with good staying power and good lacing. Smells faintly like dark chocolate. Smooth and almost creamy. Lots of roasted malts and hoppiness. A very tasty stout thats full of chocolate flavor. Another wonderful brew from Rogue.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,soper2000,4.15,One of my absolute favorite desert beers. This is pure chocolate. It pours a nice thick black with a very creamy tan head. Smell is full of roasted malts and chocolate. Taste was initially super chocolatey but later other flavors came out to play. I get faint notes of coffee and a general roasted flavor out of this as well. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is great as this is thick and creamy. Drinkability suffers a little as just 1 of these leaves me completely satiated.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Olorin,4.77,"Simply amazing, looks like chocolate syrup coming out of the bottle. Has the darkest head I've ever poured - albeit somewhat uneven bubbles. Chocolate Mocha aroma, very nice. Thick creamy deep roasted flavor. A very moving moment. Hops asserts itself, beautifully balanced and deeply satisfying. This is what I'd hoped to experience with Rogue. Silky and velvety on the tongue and all the way down. Wish I owned a case or two. Extremely fine Brussels Lace. Rogue claims to use Imported Chocolate when making this brew and it must be said it is done with a restrained hand. It is the quintessential chocolate stout. A rare find.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Holden,4.3,"Pitch black in appearance, it has a small but continuing head. Upon smelling, a roasty cocoa aroma is quite evident. The chocolate was pleasant, went well with the roasted notes, but was not overwelming. This beer has strong bitterness that does not dominate, but works well with the roasty chocolate flavors. There is a pleasant finish. A very drinkable stout!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Skidz,3.63,"Pours a deep, dark brown with a big brown head on top, some lacings. Sits jet black with a tiny bit of crimson showing through, but barely any.  Smells of raisins, dark chocolate (powdery) and malts. Not to much to the nose besides chocolate. Tastes extra strongly of chocolate....ooooh, finished with the taste of burnt marshmallow, packed inside two grahm cracker squares and a chunk of Hershey's chocolate. The should call this ""S'more Stout"" seriously...I want more. Deeply roasted grains, a slight taste of coffee and a bit of cascades top it off. Slightly bitter, but leaves my mouth feeling empty, but thirsty for more.  Medium bodied at best, packs a punch in terms of carbonation, which I suppose is for the better, otherwise, you might get sick of the burnt sweets. Not a bad beer, but it is really sweet. I'd like to drink this sitting around the campfire, in lew of eating s'mores. 22 oz. bomber does the trick for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Edwin,4.23,"Served on tap at Kclinger's Publik House  Appearance - Dark as night. Black with caramel-like head on top. Head didn't stay along for the ride, but initially this was a total prom queen of a stout.  Smell - Yum. Nutty, chocolaty with some coffee notes and roasted hints. This made my stomach growl. Very nice arome to this one.  Taste - Wow. Very nice. The cocolate is the front-runner here with the roasted and coffee flavors coming in a quick second and nuts pulled in with the bronze. A very nice array and balance of differing flavors.  Mouthfeel - Silky smooth and as comfy as an old recliner. This beer just ""fits"" on the palate. A welcome guest.  Drinkability - If I wasn't trying to accumulate passport stamps, I would have camped out on this one all night. Very drinkable.  Overall - This one is a truly remarkable brew. If you do see this one, pick it up and enjoy it. It is worth it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,PatandDavid,4,"Had on tap at Redbones. Pour was dark as night, low head dissipated quickly. Aroma was all about rich chocolate. I thought the taste was mostly dark chocolate with some roasted notes. A very nice and tasty stout that does exactly what was expected. Would get again, no problems.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TastyTaste,4.75,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Pours like motor oil. I am not exagerating at whatsoever. Thick and black, light absorbing, with the darkest brown head I have ever seen. Smells like, guess what? Chocolate! I work at a bakery and it smells just like chocolate hazelnut bagels. Sweet and smooth smelling. Taste is like many stouts, chocolate and coffee, but you can definitely taste the belgian chocolate (i think) that was used to make this stuff. I can't believe how much like bitter chocolate this stuff tastes (that is why i gave it a 5, it tastes exactly like the style it was shooting for). Very delicious dessert beer. Worthy of being ranked so high, and having the Rogue brand name.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BeerAngel,4.38,"Pours a very viscous and dark brownish-black used motor oil look with a massive rocky tan head. The smell of the expected chocolate and some roasted malt and hops make your mouth water. The ultra silky smooth taste consists of bitter-sweet chocolate with a nice rich malty roast, spicing that seems like nutmeg, and perfectly blended hops round out this fine brew! This is a heavy bodied brew that is as creamy as it gets. Very nice!  Notes: This is a dessert in a bottle and I'd take this over any actual dessert any day. A very smooth yet complex brew that is the epitome of a chocolate brew! Cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ppoitras,4.18,"Enjoyed on tap at The Moan and Dove, Amherst, MA, presented in a pint glass.  Delivered with a nice head on top of a dark brown/near black brew. Chocolate and roasted malts scream out at the nose, and the taste buds are not disappointed. Bitterness tempers the sweetness excellently, almost like a mouthful of bittersweet chocolate. Hearty, smooth, imminently drinkable. Get it if you can...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,MrNuggets,5,"Blacks as night with a thick head with a deep brown colour. Heafty brown lace around my glass. Smells of sweet malty chocolate. Blasted with sweet chocolate, then malt. Leaves me with a bitter chocolate taste. Very chewy, like taking a bite of a top notch chocolate bar. I could drink this everyday, all day, for the rest of my life. A 5 Star brew from rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kmcnair,4.57,"Pours into my glass a deep black motor oil color and leaves a thin brownish head. Leaves a moderate lacing down my glass during consumption. Looks rather good, though the head was a bit thin.  Smell is delicious, roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate.  Taste is quite good, more bittersweet chocolate and roasty character. The hops are there as this one is rather spicy.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and warming as it goes down. Leaves a thick coating on the throat.  This is a tasty brew, definitely drinkable, near perfect for after dinner. Rogue did a nice job with this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Southernbrew,4.31,"Black as motor oil with a big beautiful brown soapy head, 2 fingers high. Just looking at makes me thirsty.  Strong chocolate odor, very, very sweet, like cocoa. Slight roasted aroma as well.  Beautiful thick body with a smooth mouthfeel, excellent. This is what a stout should be like. Delicious chocolate taste with the slightest bitterness, perfect. Leaves a very nice roasted aftertaste.  This is an awesome stout that I will definitely buy again. TRY IT!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,cerevisiaephilus,2.42,Not a fan of this beer. I don't like the overt chocolate flavor. I don't think chocolate belongs in beer...except Young's Double chocolate which seems to be much less overt in the chocolate department but I know they add chocolate to that beer. In the Rogue beer they add chocolate flavoring...tastes and smells like Nestlea Quik to me actually. Really quite an artificial tasting beer to me. The mouthfeel is quite thin too. Not quite sure how this is top ranked...#19???? better than Thomas Hardy's? Hennepin??? Celebration? Man...crazyness in my opinion.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ManekiNeko,4.35,"22 oz. bomber served at cellarish temperatures in a pint glass.  Appearance: Jet black topped by a huge thick brown head. An omnipresent small layer of bubbles remained all throughout consumption. Decent-sized globules of foam were left on the sides of the glass.  Smell: Rich smell of a dark milk chocolate (but not one with high cocoa content). Strong vanilla aromas and mild whiffs of light roasted coffee. A hint of sprucy hops at the end. Nice.  Taste: Rich roasted malt and oatmeal sweetness. Light mocha flavors. A lingering bitter hop finish. Not as chocolately as I was hoping for.  Mouthfeel: Full and hearty. Very robust, nice and chewy, like a stout oughta be.  Drinkability: A rather delicious taste treat. Very smooth, but a stronger chocolate presence would be nice.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Bierguy5,4.45,"Pours a dark, almost black liquid, with a tan foamy, almost creamy head. What a great smell of bitter chocolate, and roasted dark malt. Immediate taste is of the roasted malt, with good bitterness. Then it hits, this may be the best finish of a beer I have ever had. The finish is of a cocoa powder and milk chocolate flavor. Wow! This beer has just about anything you could ask for in a chocolate stout. Good mouthfeel, maybe not a great session beer. This is a good, special occasion beer. Another winner from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jtfest,4.53,"Pours a deep chocolate-black, opaque in the glass, with a 1"" frothy coffee-mocha head. Chocolate and chicory form the aroma. Not to be redundant, but the flavor is chocolate, with a nice bitter finish reminiscent of bittersweet chocolate. Even the mouthfeel is thick and creamy, like melted (say it with me) chocolate. All of this, however, is contained within the context of a very satisfying stout. You like chocolate? You like stouts? You'll love this. You probably wouldn't want to drink it all night, but as a treat or a desert beer, it's really good.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,beergeek279,4.27,"Served in the 22 oz. bomber. The color is black, with a foamy tan head. The smell is like powdered cocoa. The taste starts with the sweet chocolate taste, and then the malt takes over, and the aftertaste is a bitter chocolate taste. Mouthfeel is average. Drinkability-wise, could have a few.  An interesting chocolate offering from Rogue, especially for those who appreciate a more dry chocolate taste. This is something I'd likely have again. Smells simply fantastic!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jahred,4.25,"Pours a dark black color with a medium-sized, beautifully tan-brown (chocolate-milk colored?) head that quickly disappears, leaving nice lace on my goblet.  The scent is of sweet, malty chocolate milk, with perhaps a hint of caramel as well (this scent got stronger as the beer warmed).  The initial taste is of bitter chocolate at the front, followed by burnt malts and a burnt, creamy, slightly hoppy aftertaste. After a few sips, I wasn't incredibly impressed - the chocolate was a bit more subtle than I expected. But as the beer warmed a bit, it got easier to drink, with the chocolate tastes devevloping even more and mixing wonderfully with the burnt, sludgy malts. The mouthfeel isn't overly thick, but enjoyable nevertheless.  I enjoyed my last few sips with a few hershey kisses lying around here - what a fantastic combination! Or maybe the taste developed because of the alcohol - I'm still not sure how much was in the bottle.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,rajendra82,4.12,"I feel like Homer Simpson right now. Mmm.... Chocolate. The first smell after opening the 22 oz bottle was a bit hoppy with a hint of coffee, similar to the Shakespeare Stout. A deeper breath and the smell of Chocolate broke through quite clearly. When poured in a pint glass, it looked the part with an opaque brown body topped with a rough brown head. The taste is dominated by the presence of chocolate. Because of the strong flavoring, other tastes are a bit hard to distinguish. I can detect a bit of coffee, and burnt toast. Quite dry and a tad too harsh in the mouthfeel department, I think. It left me wishing for more maltyness and a smoother and sweeter body. This is definitely not to be chugged, but sipped and allowed to coat your throat and tongue as it goes down.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,pheurton,4.12,"on tap at isaac newton's: inky black with an increidibly dark brown bubbling head, that retreated for the most part. on the nose...oh man, what a nose...this had to be one of the best smelling flavored stouts i've ever come across....deep dark milk chocolate covered roasted barley smell. i can't stress enough how good this beer smells. a tad bit too much carbonation thins out medium body. hints of chocolate and smoke at first sip, followed by a massive roasted flavor and quite strong (for the style) leafy hop flavor. this beer smells alot more chocolatey than it tastes. a great sippin' brew, though i don't think that i'd want more than one in a sitting. a must try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,chaduvel,4.7,"Awesome. Pours out like a can of motor oil. Two inch dark brown head not unlike the top of a chocolate milk shake. Is this a chocolate milkshake...besides the chocolate aroma the touch of hops and strong malts tell me that this is in fact a beer. Taste is incredibly smooth. Big malts up front with a pronounced hop bitterness in the middle with a finish of sweet chocolate goodness. Overall flavor is almost of baking chocolate. This is the best chocolate beer I've had yet, and one of the best stout's to boot.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,sparkydoyle,4.74,"Pours a dark black color, with a velvety dark brown head. Even the head tastes like chocolate. Nose is chocolate, and discernable well-roasted barley notes. Flavor is intense--chocolate and chocolate malt notes dominate with counterpoint of floral hops, and a cherrylike fruity note. No sweetness or sourness in the profile. Highly drinkable--mouthfeel is not thick, low carbonation.  Having had it many times over a few years, I find it amazing how consistant this beer is, regardless of whether it is served on tap or bottle. There is really nothing that the brewer could do with it to make it any more enjoyable. Great with a big slab of chocolate cake for dessert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,MobBarley,4.95,"Sampled most recently on 1/15/04. Transcribed from notes. Oh my! Simply put it doesn't get much better than this (from a bottle anyhow). Pours black as an accountant's soul with a burnt umber shard at the bottom. A luxurious, frothy cacao colored head that is tenaciously stubborn tops the brew and gives it a regal look. The smell is initially sweet like hot chocolate before moving onto more bitter, toasted notes of chocolate and creamed coffee. The taste is outlandishly appealing. Chocolate upon chocolate with the hops and alcohol more apparent when warmed. It is sweeter and more complex, not to mention more enjoyable, when allowed to warm a bit. It has a unique finish which is both green and creamy. Mouthfeel is great. Chewy, complex and mildly carbonated...perhaps slightly thin for the style. There is a lot going on here. Drinkability is perhaps a little too good. More?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,filabrazilia,4.3,Appearance - Pours a brilliant pitch black with a beautiful brown head. Good lacing sheets the glass.  Aroma - delightful milk chocolate and sugar greet the nose along with the Cascade hops.  Taste - Delicious chocolate and hops dance in the mouth in a sensory experience that is surprising and fun. This is a great tasting beer that is not too sweet but wonderfully chocolate and hoppy.  Mouthfeel - Not as thick as I would have liked. I was expecting a little more body from this beer. This was the only disappointing feature of this otherwise spectacular beer.  Drinkability - A truly drinkable beer that has changed my mind about stouts. The chocolate and hop balance make this one of the better beers I have sampled lately. The creativeness of this wonderful brew makes me proud to be a beer drinker.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,byrd,4.48,"Im not sure if a stout can look ant better that this when pouring into the glass. Pitch black in color with a large frothy tan head that has a slight cascading effect as it builds above the rim of the glass into a perfect dome shape. The head lasts a long time, slowly receding to a thick frothy lace. Lots of chocolate notes on the nose with a good amount of hops that seem earthy in nature. Some roasted and coffee notes also play in, but are intertwined with the chocolate character. This brew is huge in the flavor department and really hits my palate the right way. Roasted notes are far more apparent on the pallet then on the nose. Theres a subtle, slightly smooth start of semi sweet dark chocolate that is followed shortly after by coffee and roasted notes. A slight hint of milk chocolate comes in towards the middle, followed by and soft prickly carbonation. Good hop finish that is again a bit earthy, brings a nice balance. Roasted and coffee notes come back in the aftertaste and last forever, forcing me to draw the glass back up for another sip. Towards the end of the bottle, white sediment is noticeable as it collects on the bottom of the glass. The overall mouth feel is medium and is smooth, yet not quite so smooth due to the roasted notes. Despite this, the brew is incredibly drinkable. Im sorry to see the bottom of the glass, and Im even more sorry that I only bought two bottles.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,edchicma,4.38,"An outstanding brew....Exceptional appearance...black, choclolate creamy head, chunky and leving a beautiful lace. Smell...hops, chocolate, malt, a hint of coffee...all in their...definitely invites you to drink. Taste was initially slightly sweet, leveling off at mid palate and ending in anice hoppy burst. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and dry, almost astingent in the finish. A delight for malt, chocolate and hops lovers. Highly revommend.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Reidrover,4.1,"Another pint at Rogue's Pub on the Newport dockside. Very good beer in appearance a dark brown, dark cooking chocolate brown ale. Small tan head.

Very nice on the palate..smooth and rich. A most drinkable stout..nice",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,kbub6f,3.95,"A thick pour; opaque, black beer. The head is dark tan/brown and crusty. Nice. Spotty lacing. The nose shows off plenty of dark chocolate but no possibility of hiding the Cascades. Yum. But the hops are almost confined to the aroma. The beer starts with sweet chocolate, travels through a thick, malty, chocolate base to a bitter, dark chocolate finish. This is a very tasty chocolate drink. The Cascades in the nose offset the chocolate a little, but I wouldn't take offense if somebody called this beer ""a bit one-dimensional"".",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RocketWidget,4.38,"Comes in a nice, 22oz bomber, damm skippy. Pours a black gold, a classical stout look with a good, meaty head. Smell is of malt and what else but chocolate. Taste is straight up solid. Much less of a burnt taste is there, though still quite active, this is the best brew to ever hit the chocolate nail on the head. Bold and very drinkable, one of the best chocolate stouts out there.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Dmann,4.85,"This is dessert in a bottle! It poured a jet black color with a dark brown head that settled into a pillow of foam after about 1 min. The smell was all chocolate, just like sniffing the inside of a truffle. The taste was just amazing with a great chocolate sweetness and just enough hops to balance out the flavor. This is one that could be enjoyed with cake or ice cream or just by its self. What a beer!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bewareOFpenguin,4.5,"What the hell was I drinking? Is this beer? Who cares? It was dark, with a chocolate head.

Masterfull.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,counselor,4.13,"Bomber bottle pours black as pitch with a thick, dark, tan head. The aromas are all chocolate, not the syrupy sweet milk chocolate, but a real good bitter dark baking chocolate. The taste is roasted malts and chocolate with a keen dry hop finish.

Good stuff, but couldn't see doing more than the one bomber.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,CBFanWish,4.6,"Dark pitck black. It's like looking into the nightmares of a child. Even the head is a dark tan color. But then it all becomes a dream. The everlasting chocolate smell brings me back to my childhood. It's like unwrapping a Symphony dark chocolate bar and getting that magnificent odor. The taste is purely chocolate also. you can feel it melt on your tongue as it goes down. No beer has ever brought me back to my preteen years, except Colt .45, but that is a different story. Another A for rogue. Good times.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Admiraldinty,4.15,"Very nice. Pours jet black with a huge tan head. Aroma is of chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate - also sweet malts. First taste that hits is slightly burnt malts, then some bitterness. So much chocolate. Dry with very little actual sweetness. Extremely smooth mouthfeel with just a bit of crispness. Somewhat oatmeal stout-like. All in all this is a great brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TinusTime,4.38,"Pours the colour of night with a light mocha head which sat and lingered like froth on a cappucino. Smell is of roasted malts and Chocolate almost like an Ovaltine gone Adult. The taste is of Roasted malts at first then the chocolate slides in and dominates, just enough hops come in to dry out the palate and keep everything in line. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth with the flavours lingering around long enough to keep the smile on your face. Drinkability is good although they could fill you up quick. Overall a killer Chocolate beer. I give it the edge over the Sam Adams Chocolate Bock because the chocolate character is more subtle and refined.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BeefyMee,4.45,"22oz bomber  Appearance: Black as night. Darkish head that retained fairly well.  Smell: Mmmmm, chocolate.  Taste: No surprises here, just a thick, huge chocolatey flavor. Not overdone, although it tastes like massive amounts of chocolate were used in making the beer. A well balanced beer is evident behind the chocolate, especially in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Like no other. So rich and velvety that I was taken aback at first sip. Try the beer for this, if nothing else.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. Dangerously drinkable. I just don't think I can take so many of these in a row.  A fantastic beer and a very unique flavored stout. I will definitely buy this again, even though it lightened the wallet a little.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Gueuzedude,4.08,"Pours with a thick darkish brown head. Quite black in color. The head is so meringue like that I take a bite of it. The head is like biting into the lightest, fluffiest, slightly sweet chocolate mousse. The aroma is strongly of chocolate, it dominates the aroma of this beer. Quite a creamy body, lightly sweet as well. This beer finishes with a bit of dark malt and a subdued bitterness. Just like the aroma, the chocolate is dominant in the taste of the beer as well. It is like eating a dense, rich, creamy chocolate dessert that is only lightly sweet. Very good, though I must say that it seems a bit one-dimensional.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TPoling,4.52,"Pours a deep black with a thin, but lasting head. The nose is of chocolate and little spicy, perhaps cinnamon. The 69 IBUs are amply balanced by the malts. Chocolate and oats mellow it even further, although the hops may a play for dominance in the finish.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Foxman,4.4,"It pours a deep dark brown, but this is something you just know; it might as well be black. It's impassable to light. There's a rapid, light brown creamy head that explodes and just won't go away. The head's the color and texture of chocolate mousse. Three-dimensional lacing runs wild on the side of the glass.  Initially there's a muscular roasted malt aroma, backed by a poignant chocolate bitter-sweetness. There's a strong note of cocoa with an understatement of espresso. Overall the aroma is thick and almost sinewy, in its way.  The thick, rich malt sweetness smacks you in the teeth, and coming in next, and quickly, is the mitigating bitterness of the dark roasted grain. There's a robust thread of dark chocolate throughout the entire flavor. An espresso bitterness rings the back of the mouth at the swallow. The alcohol creates a glow that slides all the way down to the stomach. There's a vague butterscotch patch on the tongue at the finish.  Heavy bodied and dense, this stout slips and slides viscously about the mouth, covering and clinging the whole time it has its way. It deposits a dry sensation across the tongue, as well as a mildly slick buttery feel at the finish.  Chocoholics, rejoice! I like chocolate, and I like this beer! No hints here, it is what it is, and that's a thick, rich, robust stout to make Willy Wonka proud. The heft and ABV limit this to mostly singular indulgences, but that one- OK, maybe two- goes down smooth and with gustatorial delight. Nestle's Quik has always been a down-home comfort drink for me. Now that I'm a big boy, this beer will take that role. In a nutshell, you'd have to HATE chocolate not to like this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,budsboy,4.23,"Blackest of black, completely opaque. Pours thick with a dense foamy dark tan head.  Smell is chocolate malt goodness and hints of espresso and some nuts.  Oh, man, that tastes good. Chocolate bombards all of the tounge, stong bittersweet. Coffee dangles at the edges and finishes with a strong chocolate that lingers for a good long time.  Smooth and creamy in the mouth, a dessert for kings.  This is a defining beer for the style. Rogue just keeps proving itself.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,merlin48,4.52,"650 ml bottle. Pours an opaque deep brown(almost black), with an honest-to-goodness light brown head that lasts and lasts, eventually giving way to ring and sheet cocoa lacing. Big aroma of chocolate, Irish cream coffee, and burnt smoky malts. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Carbonation doesn't bite, but it's there. Taste is chocolate, roasted and caramelized. Smokiness is noticeable. Cascade hops peep in, but the Dutch chocolate drives them away. Damn, this stuff has an overwhelming taste. I don't know how any other stout can claim to be a chocolate stout, standing against this one. Excellent product here, and I love it! Really close to liquid food.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Ilacquin,4.12,"Initial impression was typical for a stout: dark, almost black with reddish highlights when tipping the glass under bright light. Head was thin, dark tan and dissipated quickly. Aroma was enough to knock your head back... at first. Deep chocolate and roasted malt, just a hint of coffee/expresso, very bold.  Taste was overwhelmingly of chocolate and roasted malt, strong and with plenty of ""bite"". Definitely not for the light of heart. Well balanced for the amount of flavor present, and definitely a superior example of the style.  Intense flavor and heavy mouthfeel detract from the overall drinkability of this beer. The single 22oz. bottle was enough to leave me burned out on chocolate, and feeling stuffed.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Gavage,4.45,"Pours a black color with a thick brown head. The aroma is sensational as chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and some more chocolate are very strong on the nose. This first smell did get me ready for the chocolate overload here. The flavor is huge, my first thought was a liquid chocolate candy bar. The chocolate is wonderful and the stout is well balanced on the malt and bitterness levels. By far the most flavorful chocolate beer I have ever consumed.  The mouthfeel is thick and full bodied. Subtle coffee and bitterness linger on the tongue behind the chocolate well into the aftertaste. The drinkability is knocked down a notch because after finishing the bomber bottle, I felt like I ate the several whole chocolate bars and I had enough for this sitting. I consider this a chocolate meal.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,JISurfer,3.26,"I think I got a bad bottle or something, cause I got no choclate in this whole beer. The most I got was a heavy bite from hops, which I don't care for too much. I have had the Brooklyn Chocolate Stout and that blows this one away, as far as balanced out malts and hops, as well as taste. This one was way too hoppy for me and had little balance. I got very little malts in it at all, which was a huge let down. The best thing about this brew, for me, was the apperance. This is simply one of the best looking beers you will ever see. Nice head retention and super dark color. The color was so beautiful, I couldn't see through it, so that's a plus in my book. Other than that, this was below average, as far as chocolate stouts go. I couldn't finish the bomber, and that says a lot to me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mschofield,4.82,"Dark ebony black with a three finger brown head. Very chocolate filled aroma, like a Lindt dark chocolate truffle, perfectly chocolaty. Roasted malt, milk and dark chocolate impressions in the taste. Very bitter from the chocolate malt Creamy smooth, full feel, very robust, some hop earthyness and a large amount of hop bitterness. Very easy to drink, the only problem is I think I'd burn out on the chocolate after awhile.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Crosling,4.5,"An excellent beer. Poured pitch black with a captivating dark tan head. Nice lacing throughout the session and nice head retention as well.  Awesome aroma. Truly smelled like a chocolate covered truffle. Absolutely fantastic!  Chocolate! Chocolate! The best chocolate stout I have ever had. Really does a favor to the style! Bittersweet chocolate destroys the hops that are fighting for survival. Some suddle coffee and toffee as well, but mainly just chocolate. This is a perfect dessert beer. Smooth and silky with a nice bitter finish.  Not a fault.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RoyalT,3.93,"Appearance  This was hands down the most awesome-looking beer that I have rated to date. The body is a gorgeous, thick black and the head was to die for. It was gigantic, spilling all over the place, then settling down into a slow receding pattern that seemed to last forever. It left a film an eighth of an inch thick on the inside of my glass.  Smell  Cowabunga! This smells like a Hersheys bar. The chocolate is very refined and laced with artificial sugars. Its actually more of a dark chocolate, almost like a baking chocolate. Either way, its great.  Theres also a nice malt base and the threat of hops at the tongue, but lets not kid ourselves. This one lives up to its name.  Taste  The hops fight their way out at the taste, but the bittersweet chocolate flavors dominate.They call on a bit of coffee for sure, but the bitter coca and refined sugars carry the show.  Mouthfeel  Not as smooth as I had hoped from the nose, but this is bordering on full-bodied and is very bitter at the mouth.  Drinkability  A perfect nightcap. This would go well with burnt crème or crème brulee.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DagFishHead,4.75,"Appearance: So black it was sucking the light out of the room, Generous creamy chocolate/espresso milkshake head with great retention and sheets of creamy lace. Smell: Powdered/sweetened hot cocoa, espresso, sweet roasted malts, earthy, hints of dark cherries. Taste: Semi-sweet malt/cocoa start, middle is full with dark fruits and minimal fizz, dry-hop/bitter-chocolate finish with lingering dry bitter aftertaste of cocoa and roasted malt. Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied malt, appropriate low level carbonation. Drinkability: Highly drinkable... Willy Shakes gone Swiss Miss. Rivals Young's Double Chocolate, but a tad more bitter and not as silky smooth.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DESTRO,4.64,"ive been looking for this forever, the day has come, my panties are creamed, and here she is in all her glory. pitch black baby. small bubbly brown head that dies down to a ring, leaves a nice lace. huge cocoa smell, dark chocolates, just damn wonderful. taste? huge chocolate everywhere, dark chocolate, unsweetened cocoa, roasted/burnt malt, a decent amount of bitterness from the hops, the aftertase is pure joy, leaving the sense that you just had an iced expresso. a little creamy and really smooth, but it finishes crisp and a bit dry. interesting mouthfeel indeed. a down right awesome brew. just like the name says, its a chocolate beast, so dont expect anything different. this one gets a goat thrown \m/. a head bang AND an ""ace of spades"" dedication.  $3.49 a bomber.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,HappyHourHero,3.53,"Dark cola colored head was solid. The beer was dark as hell, light absorbing and whatnot. It reaked of chocolate, like a bottle of chocolate syrup. The body was middle of the road which is good because I didn't feel like actually drinking a bottle of syrup. The taste was all stout, not nearly as much chocolate as in the aroma, and a little bit of roasted malt. A good beer, very drinkable. I just thought the chocolate in the aroma was overbearing and a little artificial.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,GCBrewingCo,4.2,Black motor oil stout with a huge rocky head that lasts for days. Huge chocolate aroma with a good hop backbone.

132,1118,Realale,1.92,"Opaque black. No highlights. Small dark brown head.  Sweet, low-quality milk chocolate on the nose (someone at the blind tasting said Whitman's buttercreams and they were right). Definitely buttery as well. Quite nutty too. Cloying and gross.  Surprisingly light on the palate. Lots of bitterness, and a touch of burnt malt flavor. Needs body badly. Mouthfeel is OK, length is, unfortunately, average.  Tasted blind at the 12/14/03 St. Louis BA tasting.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,AtLagerHeads,3.65,"One of the more disappointing Rogue brews I've tried. The taste on this beer is just not on mark for such a proud name. The slightly thin body provides a flavor that is just weak and quite short of stout strength. Dark as night, this beer had a small nondescript head and little lace effect. Truly short of chocolate sense as well, but long on a thin malt sense.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,winomark,2.63,"Appearance: Pours a deep dark brown with a quite thick light brown head.  Aroma: Mild chocolate tones dominate. All other aromas are quite muted.  Taste: Lots of carbonation takes away from the chocolate(which is detectable) and any other flavors that might be present.  Mouthfeel: Unimpressive, IMO. Too much carbonation creates an unwanted, flavorless void.  Drinkability: Not at all excited about this one. Doesn't live up to the hype IMO. Won't try again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bewley,4.45,"22 oz bomber that has a fanciful lady painted on it, holding an overflowing mug in one hand, and what appears to be a piece of chocolate in the other.  Oh my . . . Oh yes!  This black, viscous liquid clings to the glass like an auspicious cloud. A four sip belch emitted hints of cocoa, English toffee, wild blackberry and charred smoked casks that have been preserved in castor oil.  This is mighty good stuff!  We tried this with a piece of ""Death by Chocolate"" cake from Greg's Restaurant in Providence, RI--making for a great combination. This stout definitely deserves its high ranking.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,AbePhroman,4.55,"Bought a bomber of this for $3.49. I enjoy Rogue brews alot but never had this stout. As of yet I hadn't had many chocolate stouts, except Young's Double Chocolate. Poured it into a pint glass. Dark, syrupy brown. Nice tan head, not too big. Good lacing. Smelled very strong of chocolate. Little bit of a hops aroma too. Tastes exceptional. Not sure what the abv is on this but it seemed like a very drinkable beer. I will surely pick up a few more of these in the coming weeks.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Boilermaker88,4.87,"So, last night my wife and I had just put my son to bed and she asks me if I have any beer she might like. I check the fridge and there sat my bomber of Rogues Chocolate Stout, virtually begging to be chosen. Since my wife already is a fan of Youngs Double Chocolate Stout, she was willing to try Rogues offering. This brew had a uniform ebony hue that looked like it was sucking the light out of the room. A firm, bubbly, one-finger brown head perched atop the beer. As the beer disappeared, a solid layer of sheet lace was left behind. The rich chocolate aroma came pouring off the top well before I got my nose close to the glass. Some roasted malt notes were also present but the overwhelming aroma was chocolate. The taste was redolent of dark chocolate, amazing in its richness. It reminded me of the Swiss dark chocolate my brother gave me on his last visit back to the States. Some light oatmeal and gentle coffee flavor rounded out the taste profile. The feel was medium-bodied at first but built up in thickness as it warmed. Not quite as velvety smooth as Youngs, however. Im astounded at how much chocolate flavor and aroma is crammed into this beer. Its not a beer; its like a dark chocolate mousse that got liquified. Unbelievably drinkable; try to restrain yourself from guzzling it all before it has a chance to warm up some.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,WVbeergeek,4.52,"Appearance: Ebony just barely letting any ruby highlights through at the edges when held up to the light, seems viscous with the pour and forms a nice sized milk chocolate colored brown head leves behind beautiful uniformed webbed lacing. Aroma: Hints of roasted marshmallows, deep milky chocolate, toasted nuts just one heavenly aroma barely letting some floral notes of hops. Taste: Ladies and gents what a beer, this one is definitely worthy of the Best of BA, with dark roasts blending with hop bitterness in the finish upfront the beer is full of toasted nuts and chocolate pleasure. Nothing compares to this one just awesome I like Brooklyn's Luxury Double Chocolate and Young's as well but this one kicks up a notch in the right direction. Mouthfeel: Full bodied almost chewy definitely pours like motor oil this is one big brew, awesome.

Taste is full of milky chocolate, well-rounded and very, very good. Nice touch of hops, too, and their bitterness makes for a dry, almost dark chocolate like finish. Easy to drink, and prettty much wonderful. I'm a big fan.  This was a great dessert on Thanksgiving, too.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Darkale,4.13,"Nearly black body. Magnificent tan head is creamy and uneven on the top and large-bubbled on the bottom. Yeasty aroma with a deep noseful of chocolate.  Burning, thin, and raspy in the mouth, with just a slice of cool creaminess coming through before you swallow. Interesting mixture of sensations. I would prefer a bit more thickness in the mouth, but I cannot find it in me to condemn this beer because of that wonderful mixture of raspiness and cream.  This is definitely a beer that you will not want to serve too cold. It just got better and better as it warmed.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,NickLovesBeer,4.5,"Chocolate Stout pours pitch black in color with a huge tan head and great lacing. It smells of chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate.

Theres a hop bitterness hiding in there, also. This is a special beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,dmarch,4.21,"Jet black in appearance with a thick tan head. Aroma of chocoalate liquor. Taste is of dark chocolate, not overly sweet.

Taste is great, and basically the same as the aroma. The mouthfeel is too thin for my liking, but I'll live. Drinkability: I'm pretty sure I could polish off two or three of these in a night. Good, but not as good as Shakespeare. But then again, what is? Rogue set themselves an impossible standard with that one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Mitchster,4.45,"Compared to the draft version (see my review), the differences I notice in the bottled version are 1)There is a hint of nutmeg or ginger towards the middle...it's slightly spicier but in a herbal fashion, 2)The chocolate flavor and aroma is more subdued, 3) The mouthfeel is a little denser, silken and smooth, but not quite as soft. This is still my favorite chocolate stout, however the draft was a pure pint of heaven.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,HardTarget,4.32,"Aroma: Hops, and dark chocolate. First smell was the stout style maltiness, then came some of the aggressive hop, now, all I can smell is the deep dark chocolate. Appearance: Jet-black, even with back lighting. A fluffy tan head retreated to a light coat and laced Flavor: Backbone of classic stout roasted malt, nice hop bitter at the end, all of which is covered with a coffee chocolate coating. The chocolate taste seems to melt away to expose the slightly bitter, refreshing finish. A chocolate covered hop? Mouthfeel: Medium body with a nice creamy consistency, and a bitter tingle at the end Overall Impression: A smooth clean tasting beer with a chocolate twist. The chocolate is present, but not overwhelming, a nice counterpoint to a typically (for Rogue) delicious stout. There is more of the chocolate in the nose than the taste, but it&#8217;s all good. Makes me want to try more chocolate in my homebrews. Drinkability is great; I had trouble writing the review between sips, the nice dry finish invites another mouthful. Recommended, I&#8217;ll be getting more of this for dinner party desserts.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,JMH_,4.4,"rogue hits the nail on the head again. this is a damn fine brew. pours black as hell with a dark tan, foamy head that is oh so creamy looking. there is an obvious sweet chocolate smell that dominates with a bit of maltiness as well. it smells (and tastes) a bit like chocolate milk. the chocolate is more dominant in the flavour than the smell, which was maybe the only drawback for me with this beer...it was a bit too sweet at times. if that was toned down a bit, this would be that much better of a beer. very creamy and smooth, and just enjoyable all around.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ADR,3.83,"A big and thick black pour generates a decent and creamy tannish head that's slightly more even in color than Shakespeare. Nice intricate lacing properties. Aroma is too tipped toward chocolate to my mind, quite strong and unidimensional. Excellent body, mouthfeel, and proper carbonation. But like the smell, the malt flavors and sweetness leans too far to the chocolate side for my everyday tastes, just a slight coffee compensates. Just when you think this is going to be a Young's Luxury Double on steroids, the famed Rogue hopping balances very well and brings the close and after sensation about. A good beer for the right mood, it just lacks the slightly more masterful complexity and outstanding balance of Rogue Shakespeare Stout -- still the finest beer on the planet in so many characteristics. More than one pint of Chocolate Stout at a time gets very cloying for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,granger10,4.05,"The pour was black and I couldn't see through it. Head was tan but pretty weak and faded fast. Nice lacing though. Smell was of a cocoa flavor. Taste was strong! Intense flavors came through. Lots of chocolate, but not really sweet chocolate, more bitter chocolate flavor. Another flavor was a woody flavor that complemented the chocolate nicely. Mixture of sweetness and hoppiness stayed balanced throughout. Very roasted feel in the finish. Medium carbonation and a medium to thick body here. Improved as it warmed. One intense beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,dedalus,4.15,"huge pint and 6 ounce bottle. great gift from a great friend.  poured out black with a tiny, darkish, custard-colored head, which dissipated quickly and left only a bit of lacing.  a powerful nose of sweet chocolate and the ubiquitous cascade hop. a lot like the mocha porter, but more chocolatey.  a rather watery mouthfeel, but nothing that the flavors don't make up for.  these flavors were a shock, because i'm used to beer showing its sweetness first, and balancing that sweetness out with hoppy bitter balance. but this rogue is all grapefruity hops up front, and then the chocolate starts to peek its head out in the middle. the finish is a long, slow mingling of the now fully present chocolate and the fading but still powerful cascade hop flavors.  i haven't had many rogue brews, but this one shows an uncommon balance. the massive hoppiness is joined by a serious dose of roast and chocolate, which makes this the best rogue i've tasted so far. excellent stout.  cheers,  s.d.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,Sudmissle,4.57,"I thought Young's Chocolate Stout was top dog in this class until I tried this. This has a dark brown color, a thick head, as with the Rogue Shakespeare Stout. I find the Chocolate flavor to be ideal, strong enough to know it's chocolate, but without tasting artificial or being overbearing as to ruin the stout taste. A thick, hanging, tongue-coating mouthfeel with an aftertaste that follows the initial coffee and chocolate flavors through. It is somewhat pricey, but after drinking many good stouts, this one is very memorable with the ideal amount of chocolate. Unlike flavored coffees that taste gimmicky or artificial, this is an ideal blend of stout and chocolate flavors.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,rastaman,3.5,"Like Youngs Double Chocolate Stout, its a bit gimicky. Sweet vanilla and chocolate flavour to start off with.

The chocolate flavor so dominates this brew, that I can barely taste the stout. This fails in combining the best of stout and chocolate because, it is just chocolate without any marriage of beer flavor.  This is a dry, dry beer and the chocolate tasted artificial.  Maybe this is review is low because I had the Choco-bear bottling.  On second tasting a week or too later I had to lower my review. This is a suboptimal beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,OldFrothingSlosh,4.62,"Presentation: 22oz. bomber. Typical Rogue screened images on the bottle.  Appearance: Inky black in appearance. The thinnest shaft of light is able to barely squeeze around the edges when held up to the light. A veritable ""black hole"" of beer. Thick and creamy deep tan-colored head spouts forth during the pour, only to quickly retreat to the edges of the glass, where it built a patchwork quilt of lace down the glass.  Smell: Open a chocolate candy bar. Inhale. Repeat. Dominated by chocolate, this beast of a brew barely lets anything else into the nostrils. Only the faintest scents of choclate and roasted nuts are detected before being overwhelmed in a chocolate avalanche. Far and away the most amazing beer I've ever smelled. How in the world do they get this to smell so incredibly chocolatey?  Taste: Remeber the kid (Augustus Gloop) in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" who threw himself into the river of chocolate? That's me with this beer. I could jump in and swim in it all day long. The flavor is incredible. It teases you in the beginning with just a taste of chocolate, only to follow with a 5-alarm fire of chocolate flavor that lasts until the very end, where the dark and bittersweet chocolate plays upon your palate for what seems like an eternity. Amazing.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and so very creamy.  Drinkability: Way, way up there. One to sip and savor over many minutes. This would be awesome with some vanilla ice cream...though it doesjust fine on its own.  Another spectacular beer from Rogue!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Shaw,4.18,"I've given a more detailed review to Rogue Chocolate Stout in its draft version below, but wanted to make a short note about the 22-ounce bottled version, which I've had more of than the draft. (I even paid a friend $60 to bring a case back from Oregon to Florida.)  The bottled version is still excellent (in my top ten), but it's just not quite as good as the draft. The chocolate aroma and taste is more muted in the bottle than when you have it draft. But that may be because I've had it draft right at the brewery, while the bottles are usually a bit older?  This bottled beer is one that I could drink exclusively for the rest of my life. And the draft is even better.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,aaronh,4.3,"Deep brown color with reddish highights, topped by a nice brown head that shows good retention as it slowly fades to a rocky layer of foam. Aroma is sweet, with roasted notes and good chocolate scents, but there's also a good hop component as well. The taste is very good, with sweet malt and dark chocloate notes surrounding a slightly fruity note. Then a great coffee flavor sweeps in accompanied by a blast of bitterness on the finish. The lingering aftertaste is a lot like eating dark chocolate cake with raspberries and then chasing it with an irish coffee. It surprising how much the chocolate flavors show through, as this is not a one dimensional beer at all. Much more chocolate than Youngs double Chocolate, and a heck of a lot more of everything else as well. This is one of those beers that I had passed by a few times, not wanting to pay the PA premium. But I'm glad I finally got a bottle last month. This is a great beer, truly deserving of its praise. Now if I could only get this much chocolate taste in a beer without the complimenting (and great) bitterness, maybe I could get my wife to have a brew.

132,1118,kevinl6,4.75,"One of the best beers period, in my opinion. A must try for any stout lover. It is pretty much true to its name, but I'll describe my thoughts of the brew anyway: This one pours thick, and is a black hole of a brew. A nice thin, light brown head caps it off. Smell is chocolate and roasty, and...oh yeah, chocolate. Taste is exceptional.....very chocolaty, perhaps slight hints of coffee...but mainly chocolate, and more chocolate! A thick and smooth mouthfeel, easy on the palate. This one is a little thick to drink too many, but that's a good thing in my book. Nonetheless, I usually limit myself to one of these at a 'sitting'..........a delicious brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,Stingray5,2.11,"22oz bomber pours a deep brown with a medium tan head. Aroma is immediately milk chocolate, dried fruit, cinnamon and nutmeg, some hops. Prominent, but not entirely to my liking. Above average carbonation for a stout. Taste is of solid milk chocolate easter bunny, with some nutty, spicy notes. Quite complex, but the chocolate is WAY too overpowering. More bitter spiciness and nutmeg in the finish. Chocolate strays to bitter as it warms. Seems to be a quality brew, but to me this stuff is foul.  Granted this is a chocolate stout, but the chocolate is way too overpowering. A complex, well crafted brew, but the over the top chocolate and spices just aren't for me. It was like trying to drink a melted Hershey bar. I couldn't finish it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,oberon,4.32,"Wow what a appetizing beer,poures a ddep brown color with an off-white creamy head,the aroma is of biiter chocolate and powdered sugar.Flavor is malty sweet and of course...chocolaty nice and creamy tasting with a nice sweet finish.One of the better stouts I have had in some time.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,daledeee,4.43,"Looks like chocolate, smells like chocolate, tastes like chocolate. I almost forgot this is beer. This is good beer. Pours a beautiful opaque with very brown high head. The head even tastes like chocolate. Not sure if the taste is bitter chocolate bar or cocoa right out of the can!! I drank this at about 50-55F. Somewhat dry finish, yet creamy. The taste sticks around. No need to hurry. Enjoy.The only thing that held the score down was a momentary different taste right when you take a sip. Also readily available. Rogue Brewery is one of the top brewrys in the U.S.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,brewdlyhooked13,4.97,"I enjoyed this 22-ounce beer in a Belgian glass. It pours out a solid black with a dark mocha head that is gone in seconds. A darker head than usual, looks like serious stuff. No lacing, but some impressive oily sheeting action, more indicative of an Imperial than a regular stout. Not sure how proper that is for the style, but it's nice enough looking, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt score-wise. As I was getting near the end of this sampling, I thought I noticed dregs in the glass, so I gently enjoyed my last sips with an eye on the bottom to see. Sure enough, there is a tiny bit of sediment in the glass, chocolate solids I suppose.  The aroma is hot fudge, Hershey's syrup, a sheer joy to sniff. And sniff, and sniff. *Man* that's good!  The taste involves a great range of chocolate effects. Initially, the malty sweetness creates more of a milk chocolate taste, but only briefly. As the carbonation kicks in, so does some bitterness, and the taste transforms to bittersweet chocolate, even baking chocolate. As the swallow ensues, some of the more standard porter properties emerge - dark roastiness, charcoal taste, and a lingering bitterness. The chocolate never quite goes away, however, you just get new and different aspects of how it combines with the other ingredients as the taste develops and then winds down. The aftertaste is bitterness in the back, chocolate in the middle. Outstanding.  Mouthfeel is heavy, smooth and silky, fairly oily, and right on to make this chocolate stout near edible. Wonderfully coating like a layer of chocolate frosting for the mouth!  Drinkability - I enjoy fine chocolate as it is, Valrhona Noir Amer being one of my favorites, and Callebaut. This beer is so deliciously chocolaty I could sip it all night long. It's just too good to stay away from!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,GreatPondBrewer,4.33,"22oz. Bomber This is the desert beer. so sweet, but it retained all its stout like qualities and was never overwhelmed by the chocolate. Poured stout black with a ruddy tan head. The smell was initially dominated by sweet chocolates and was rounded out by mollasses and brown sugar. The taste was tons of meaty, deep smooth chocolates and caramel with a malty middle and a huge Rogue like hop finish with plenty of bitterness. Kind of like Shakespeare stout with chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Nytemare,4.35,"Appearance: This brew poured a dark, dark brown with a beautiful tan head that took quite some time to dissipate.  Smell: Sticking my nose over the rim of this glass was a pleasure. I got a nose full of roasted malt and nice dark chocolate. Delightful.  Taste: Even better than it smelled. A nice front of hops followed by an exceptional roasted malt and chocolate flavor that lingered for while. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Seemed full bodied compared to most beers I drink. Was smooth and creamy.  Drinkability: As I told my wife, I could drink this quite often. Easy to drink.  Overall I was impressed. I've had several Rogue beers now and have liked all of them, including the Hazelnut Brown Nectar and Dead Guy, but this one blew me away. Definately a beer first, but the chocolate flavor is definately there. Thanx to Liquid Solutions for this one, had to order it because I can't find it anywhere around me. I'll keep an eye out for it though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,JohnnyDuvel,4.32,"Excellent. As much as a chocolate flavor as any other, and a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness. This may be the best Rogue I've had. For once, the hops don't dominate. Nice body, appearance is as it should be. Good head retention, lacing throughout. Tastes like a Hershey bar. Had it along with Young's Double Chocolate, and I would give Rogue the nod.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,tavernjef,4.58,"Color of dark black chocolate; how fitting... a tight spongy one finger high head of light brown broken chocolate that faded fast and leaves lots of incredible finely stitched lacing leaving rings and layers.  Smells like chocolate milk and semi-sweet chocolate chips, rich, sweet, and very chocolatey, yum!  Taste is fluffy semi-sweet chocolate and chocolate milk with sweet soda like carbonation with a nice chocolatey sweet twinge, trace of hops, breadish in the finish thats tangy with a light thinning dryness. Favorable to chocolate milk with coco-puffs cereal. What a treat!  Feel starts thin, middle favors mildly smooth texture, medium body, and a milky thinning finish of breadish quality. This is one fun drinkable brew. The milk chocolate aspect and character of it is amazing. I'm koo-koo for Rogue Choco-Stout!  Thanks to weefisheads for the bottles.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,SheepNutz,4.37,"I had this one in a 22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black with 1 finger of dark tan head. There is just minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is rich in cocoa and molasses. There is a hint of hop aroma also. The taste is full of chocolate with some coffee and toffee undertones. It is exceptionally smooth also. The mouthfeel is nice and heavy, and just a little bubbly. The drinkability is also fairly good for this fine dessert beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Morris729,4.62,Pours ink black with a tall pillowy tan colored head that very slowly dissipates leaving spider webs of lace across the sides of the glass. Nose is milk chocolate and fresh cocoa and is very inviting. Full in body with a very creamy mouth feel. Taste is sweet roasted malts and dark fruit followed by tons of bittersweet chocolate with notes of unsweetened dark chocolate in the aftertaste. A marvelous brew and a perfect choice as a dessert drink. Thanks to Loki for the sample!,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,euskera,4.78,"Tasted this last night with a friend (converted from shyte beer to a BA)..  Black as molasses in appearance. Chocolate is evident on the nose, with a profoundly charming malt presence. The taste is complex; I got coffee at first, then malt with a touch of hoppy character with a velvety smooth, embracing mouthfeel. Then, just as you start to swallow, and for a fleeting moment, the delightful taste of chocolate truffle.  Truly a masterpiece of the brewer's art. A fantastic dessert beer, but seeing that I'm a BA and a choc-a-holic, I could drink this delightful concoction any time, anywhere..",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,MJR,4.53,"Purchased in Boston the weekend of the AoBF...  Appearance: Pours an inky black with brown highlights. It's completely opaque, with zero light entering or leaving. A creamy, dark brown head starts out thick and creamy, then shrinks to a steady cap. Great lacing on the glass.  Smell: The aroma is rich and inviting with a hefty dose of chocolate on top of a backbone of roasted malt. There's a faint suggestion of green hops, as well as a touch of licorice. Oh baby...  Taste: Starts out creamy and chocolately with notes of coffee and roasted malts. The chocolate isn't overpowering at all...it's just another facet of the flavor profile. After the rich beginning of malt and chocolate, the Cascade hops assert themselves with a firm bitterness and green freshness. The aftertaste shifts the focus back to the chocolate, with a hint of bitterness from the roasted barley. Very delicious!  Mouthfeel: Velvety and smooth with a medium thickness. The finish is a bit on the dry side.  Drinkability: While some may hold this one until dessert, I could enjoy it anytime. The chocolate flavor is well balanced and integrated. More please!  This black, deep brew is a fantastic accompaniment to Johnny Cash-American IV: The Man Comes Around.  Double your pleasure, Double your Black!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Popsinc,4.2,"Black pout, huge broze head. The nose was chocolatey but not sweet. The taste was heavenly. Rich with cholcolate, both dark and unsweetened. A nice bitterness but not so much that it takes away from the chocolatley treat. Somewhat creamy. A nice rich finish that lingers long after. This is what a chocolate stout should be! A true classic of the style and of the overall beer world!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Loki,4.57,"Sampled in a 650 mL bottle with a lovely lady on the front and great ingredient and other info printed on the bottle.  Smelled exactly like chocolate whoppers candy. That's all I got, whoppers candy through and through.  Tastes of dark chocolate, malt, and oats. Exactly like whoppers candy, the label says chocolate truffles, but I've never had chocolate truffles so I say whoppers candies. Also had tastes of oatmeal and hops.  Medium-high body with decent, but not great mouthfeel. A beautiful chocolate stout and a chocolate lovers wet dream.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,far333,4.05,"Inky black liquid with a small, but dark mahogany colored head. The head doesn't stick around too long, but leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is distinctly of chocolate, with hints of vanilla and toffee. The chocolate flavor is just right - slightly understated, not overdone or overpowering at all, and it doesn't fight with the fine hop bitterness. Smooth and well-rounded mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable for a stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,StevieW,4.73,"22 oz bomber bottle. Loud glug, glug, glug pour. Beautiful nearly black to dark brown body. Fluffy, bubbly, thick, carmel colored head. Perfect appearance. Nice rich chocolate smell. Full chocolate cake with hershey syrup. Touch of hops present. Taste is rich full on chocolate goodness. Thick oatmeal stout feel and touch of oatmeal taste. Beyond smooth and creamy, into another level. Full bodied, rich chocolate flavors and a snap of hop bitterness, make it taste like bittersweet chocolate chips. One of the best beers I have had to date. Just plain incredible !",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BierReise,4.25,"Dark Godiva chocolate brown and thick with a dark froth. Aroma is distinctly chocolate, roasted malt and a little earthy.

132,1118,Dantes,4,"Package: 22oz. crowned bottle, labeled 69 IBU and 15º Plato. Short description, ingredients list, and dedication.  Cost: $3.49 at Bottle King  Presentation: ~11oz. (1/2 bottle) in a pint glass at 45º.  Appearance: Typical, unremarkable opaque, black body with brown edges. Formed a decent, chocolate-milk colored head of moderate life-span.  Smell: I was disappointed by the lack of outright chocolate sensation. It was much more of a smoky, malty, coffee-like nose with a hint of hops.  Taste: Again, disappointing in the chocolate department. I&#8217;m a huge chocolate fan (REAL, DARK, chocolate) and was expecting a lot from this. Although present, the chocolate flavor was somewhat weak, and did not mesh well with the hops. I think that the oats help carry the flavor and round out the brew, but there is still too much in the way of burnt coffee, tannins, and hops. In this respect, I think the Young&#8217;s is superior. Maybe Rogue should get in touch with Scharffenberger Chocolates. Nevertheless, this stout offers a great deal of flavor and complexity. Similar in taste to the Shakespeare Stout, with a smoother, earthy, minutely sweeter finish.  Mouthfeel: Refined and smooth on the palate. Despite the strong, &#8220;burnt&#8221; astringency; this is creamy and full.  Drinkability: Smoothly drinkable, and in some ways more drinkable than the Shakespeare Stout. I had no problem finishing the bottle, and would argue that this is a perfect example of why 22oz. bombers seem an awkward size to me. Too small for two perfect pints, and too much if you&#8217;re interested in indulging in a few different beers in one sitting.  This beer really puzzles me. I like it, but don&#8217;t really see it as a &#8220;flavored&#8221; stout. It doesn&#8217;t seem any more &#8220;chocolatey&#8221; than Brooklyn&#8217;s Black Chocolate Stout or even Bell&#8217;s Double Cream and Expedition Stouts which seemed very chocolatey without having any chocolate added. Rather, it seemed more like a supercharged oatmeal stout.  Bottom Line: Another fine example of Rogue&#8217;s constant innovation.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Ahhdball,4.1,"I bought this at my favorite grocrey shopping mega-plex, Jungle Jims. I waited a little while to try it with someone but he never came around (Rick!), ahh well, more for me.  It poured slowly and full of chocolate and coffee hints. The hint of the chocolate was stronger than the coffee but not overpowering. It left good lace around my glass as one drink led to another.  Better than most Chocolate Stouts but I am still having a tough time getting Chocolate and Coffee to taste good together. Don't get me wrong I liked this beer but I like a bit more stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,clvand0,3.35,"This beer is fairly rich in flavor, but not thick in flow.

132,1118,kunzbrew,4.87,"This brew pours a an opaque black with a nice size rich creamy head that last a little awhile and leaves a nice silky sexy lace in its tracks. The sweet smell of chocolate milk fill my nose and bring me back to when I was a child. THis is making me want that little nestle quik rabbit. The aroma of roated malts also fill the nose.  The first sip is very rewarding, the chocolate is wonderful and the toasted malts are very flavorful. The hop flavor is low but that is ok, it doesn't make a difference.  This is a kick ass beer from a kick brewery.  Cheers",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,PhantomVodoo,4.32,"Opaque dark brown to black in color with minimal brown head. Aroma dominated by chocolate. Roasted malt and citrus hops come into play as well.  Smooth. Chocolate and roasted malt. Hops balance this beer nicely. Bittersweet chocolate lingers a bit on the palate.  Good, creamy mouthfeel. Good to very good drinkability.  If you want chocolate, this is the beer. Quite tasty.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,goz,4.41,"Pours a deep opaque black, with a quickly diminishing small creamy tan head which leaves a minimum of lacing. Aroma is nice and full of dark bakers chocolate. Flavor is similar, with dark (maybe a semi-sweet) bakers chocolate being dominant, and a hint of hops bitterness in the end. Body is smooth, creamy, and slick. Goes down quite easy, great with desert, or maybe by itself for desert.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,francisweizen,4.5,"Opaque black with a huge tan-nish, brown head. Aromas are of bitter, dark chocolate (duh!), roasted coffee, hops, malts, caramel, and other things. Taste is more of the same. Very chocolate-y, a bit bitter, and very malty with some hops in the finish. This beer is very similar to their Shakespeare stout, which is what the recipe is based on anyway. The mouthfeel is very creamy and solid and the drinkability is very good as well. Another killer beer from Rogue! Cheers! -F  Cheers to Sakaroo for the sample!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mickeymac,4.57,"It's inky-black with a nice tan head that leaves lace down the glass. As soon as the smell hits the nose, you know you're in for a treat. Chocolate and oats with a fair dose of hops blend together very nicely, leaving you in serious anticipation of the first drink. As a chocolate lover, I'm certainly biased, but the flavor is fantastic. The chocolate is more akin to semi-sweet baking chololate than the milk chocolate commonly used in desserts. However, it does make a wonderful dessert beer. I enjoyed this after a big plate of spaghetti with Italian sausage and was ready to loosen my belt and take a nap. Chocolate and beer in almost perfect combination--this is life as it should be.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,marburg,4.92,"Goddamn I love this beer. I used to take three of the 22oz bottles to keg parties in college so I could avoid The Beast and use the chocolate taste to pick up chicks.  I was lame; what can I say?  But since that time, I've gotten a job, gotten responsible, and gotten engaged -- and I still love this brew. Simply amazing.  Smells like freshly baked chocolate cake served with a glass of chocolate millk finished off with a Hershey's chocolate bar for dessert.  Flavor starts with an intense sweetness driven primarily by CHOCOLATE. It's balanced on the back end by some roasted malt and palate-cleansing hop flavor.  Just awesome in every way.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Dogbrick,4.18,"Pours a luscious black color with a thick dark beige head. Nice lacing as well. Aroma of chocolate and malt.

132,1118,feloniousmonk,4.7,"A mighty stout, and mighty, mighty delicious! Black as the dark night, she is, with a thick, prodigious, bubbly brown head. With a little stirring, it reminds me of Quik cocoa mix, which adequately describes the aroma and the taste! Aroma is dry and earthy, loaded with cocoa,plus hints of anise and rum. It all gets richer, the more I drink in the nose...so pull it out, and drink already! Smooth, very smooth, and tasty. Chocolate taste is not shy, and lingers in the mouth. Goodness gravy, this is delicious! Oh, yummy... Any technical knowledge I can pretend to fails me, and with a very good reason. This was the third, and largest, sample in my trio of chocolate stout tastings. I may have gone overboard...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Tballz420,4.4,"Damn this is good. A large dark brown head on the pour, and the beer itself is black a coal, even when head up to the light there is no color change.

Ive never had a chocolate beer before, so i cant compare to others, but if you run across this in the store i would definately recommend it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,marc77,4.22,"Opaque jet black. Brown, slowly settling fluffy head leaves spotty lace. Buttery, pure milk chocolate sweetness hits the nose at first, then is ceded by notes of carob and suggestions of chocolate covered candied orange peel along with coffeeish, borderline burnt roasted barley. Real chocolate never wavers in aroma, remaining constant and assertive. A joy to inhale. Snap of dark caramel sweetness is superceded by drying, pronounced hop bitterness and notes of unsweetened cocoa. Real chocolate is less assertive in flavor as the aroma would indicate, but persists throughout to underlay a smoothly bittersweet undertone. Roasted malted barley eeks in mid palate, lending a subtle smoky, carbonaceous charcoal impression. Overshadowed citrusy hop flavor struggles to add complexity. A touch light in body, with a thinnish, over attenuated mouthfeel saved by the oat glucans. Finishes with surprisingly pronounced notes of dark roast coffee and cream widening into a lingering hop bitterness. Rogue Chocolate is a delicious, rich stout. I prefer my Willy Shakes unadulterated, since the chocolate character muted the hop and roasted grain profile. A highly enjoyable treat nonetheless.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Redrover,4.22,"Brown Bomber. This beer pours a very dark brown with a nice tan head. Very good lacing.  The smell is wonderful!! Chocolate and roasted malt. The chocolate tones remind me of hersheys syrup.  This is a great tasting beer. The chocolate is very evident but does not overpower the malts. The hops seem to be just evident enough to keep the beer balanced. Wonderful mouthfeel, this beer just slides down. Great carbonation for style.  The beer is a little sweet to drink all night, but I think of this as almost a celebration beer. You know the one you have to celebrate little things like a football win, the end of the week, etc.  I really like this beer and I think most people will agree with me!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,nomad,4.33,"A pretty dark stout color with a strong mocha colored head. The lace thin but very strong and stained the glass big time as I drank the brew down. Very nice to look at. Nose was (guess) chocolate, candied sugar, caramel nougat, and a little rum-like ester. All were appetizing to smell, but none were presented or combined in an impressive way. Taste was (guess) chocolate and candied sugar. Had a dry hoppy finish but of the bitter sort you'd find in good chocolate. Even better was its almost fruity espresso flavors in the middle of its flavor profile. The mouthfeel was thin with a fizz that came from the head and hops. A very straightforward beer but by no means boring and one of the better stouts out of the six famous and beeradvocate highly-ranked ones I've had recently. Simple and simply edible, this is a tasty stout I am welcome to return to. With a way too easy mouthfeel, and skilled brewing, its a beer version of milk chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Kunsan90,4.22,"As the beer poured pitch black, the aroma was heavily dominated by chocolate, with hints of coffee; as if I expected something else. As it poured, a thick, frothy, dark tan head formed which lasted for several good swigs. As the head receded, a decent lace-work was left behind.  The initial sensation, flavor was of course chocolate. But its done very nicely. The hop taste balanced out the chocolate, which created a nicely balanced stout.  The mouth feel was slightly lighter than I expected, but it was still very good. As stated earlier, the initial taste was dominated by chocolate, support by coffee, and was accompanied in the end by a hop bite the quickly subsided.  The was first taste of Rogues version of a Chocolate Stout and it wont be my last.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,nixhecks,4.05,"Bought a 22 oz. bomber of this to help me get in the mood to study for me midterm tomorrow (something about that didn't sound right, hmm). Poured a oily jet black and produced a very large, very thick, creamy brown head - left lace all the way down the glass. The smell was dominated by cocoa, with small hints of roasted coffee. The first sip is always the best with any chocolate stout, and this one didn't let me down. Somewhat higher carbonation relative to others i have tried. The overall taste was of rich chocolate fighting with the hops for mouth domination - thats how i would describe it. In the end they both live in peace, blending into a bittersweet chocolate finish. And we all lived happily ever after - time to study.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,johnrobe,4.07,"What can I say? The name says it all. Chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. It's like having a thin chocolate shake. It pours a dark, used motor oil black with a creamy tan head that disappears all too soon. The smell takes me back to a childhood of quaffing chocolate Carnation Instant Breakfast before rushing off to school. If only I had been drinking this instead, classes would've been oh so much more enjoyable. The flavors come in waves. First there is a quick, muted blast of citrus, then wave after wave of chocolate; first sweet and creamy, then bittersweet. The finish leaves you with a bit of roast barley bitterness. The moutfeel is quite smooth, more like a dry stout. Good Stuff, though between the two I'd choose Shakespeare Stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,BeerGlassesCollector,4.03,Tried this stout thanks to Gusler. It pours a dark black colour topped by a creamy tanned head. Aroma consists of chocolate with hints of malt and coffee. Strong dark chocolate dominates the taste. An excellent beer. The only disadvantage is that it's a bit poor on the drinkability point of view. I wouldn't have more than 1 liter in one go.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,SamuraiJack,4.17,"This one is a chocolate stout in the true and literal sense of the word!! On first pour it is truly and deeply dark black - with a head that is deep, creamy tan foam. Aroma is overwhelmingly chocolate malt with some light coffee touchs. Initial taste is strong dark chocolate with very little milk flavours, very smooth and creamy while still a little dry. The chocolate flavours dominate and, in fact, are nearly overwhelming (the one real weakness of the beer). Mouthfeel is less creamy than most chocolate stouts. It goes down smoothly, leaving little in the way of aftertaste. I like the beer - but I don't know if I could recommend it given that it's the kind of beer some might really dislike. The chocolate flavours are SO strong that it's almost not even a beer but rather some sort of chocolate desert malt beverage.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Jarod,4.82,"This beer came to me a black color that when held to the light the edges glowed a burnt red. The head was tan in color, that was somewhat thin but what was there was creamy. The aroma was quite simply put - chocolate milk. Semi-sweet in nature but all I got was 96% chocolate milk and 4 percent malt. The taste was also mostly creamy chocolate milk with hints of dark malt and some bitter chocolate. Full the whole way through and left a creamy feeling at the finish. A beer for all times of the day. Simply put.....EXCELLENT....I need not say more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,RonfromJersey,4.5,"Thought this appropiate for Valentine's Day.  Pours black, with a brown frothy head, at first dark, then a lighter shade. Settles into a Guinness-style thick table top. Aroma is rich chocolate. Oh wow. Taste starts off with roasted malt, a thin but respectable layer of hops, and finishes with enough chocolate to make you feel you had a melting Hershey's kiss in your mouth when you drank. And with signature oatmeal notes mixed in. Definitely an oatmeal stout at the bottom of this specialty. Thick, lush, and smooth across the tongue. Had this a couple years ago, and thought the chocolate was way over the top, but it is far more balanced now. An exceptional dessert beer / nightcapper.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Bruiser81,4.38,"This brew was all black with very tan creamy head that diminshed into a thin layer with excellent lacing. This brew just looks creamy smooth. The smell is all rich chocolate with a slightly bitter tinge. The taste again is all chocolate, big surprise there, even though there is a lightly bitter finish which gives this brew an excellent balance. If it wasn't for the bitter end it would be too sweet. This is my new favorite stout, especially for dessert. I used this brew to top of a steak and it was excellent.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Quaffer,4.45,"22 oz. bottle.  Appearance: This beer was pure black, with no light shining through at all, and it poured nice and thick. The head was a deep brown. When poured into a snifter, the head was creamy and coated the sides of the glass whenever it was tipped. When poured into a pint glass, the head rose up huge and rocky, settling back down to leave quite a bit of lace on the glass.  Smell: Well, I'll be damned. It smelled like chocolate. Go figure. A nice mild chocolate or cocoa aroma dominated this brew. When smelled from the bottle, that's all I could smell. It was like I was sniffing a chocolate bar. From the glass, the chocolate aroma was accompanied by a hoppy bite.  Mouthfeel: This was a very smooth, creamy, full beer. Very nice.  Taste: Once again, no surprises here: chocolate! And not the bitter chocolate flavors you get from roasted chocolate malts, this tasted just like chocolate. The flavor was not overpowering, though, and there really wasn't any excessive sweetness. There was a good balance achieved due to a light hops bitterness on the finish.  I really didn't think that I would like this beer. I figured that it would be either too sweet, or just taste like a cheap, flavored beer. I should have known better considering this brew comes from Rogue. They did a great job of creating a mellow, chocolate stout without slapping you in the face with the flavor. Instead of seeming artificial, it just seems ""right.""",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,the42ndtourist,4.48,"Pours out thick and black, with a deep tan head. Ample thick lacing down the glass. The head fades, but a mostly covering layer remains. Nice. Aroma is kind of milk chocolate-y, with a leaning towards dark bitter chocolate. Taste is sensational. A beautiful chocolate lays over the malts and oats. A very nice choice indeed to make a chocolate stout out of an oatmeal stout (not the Sammy Smith type, the oaty bitter type). These two flavours work very well against each other, with a little hops following along (very reserved and suitable). Thick and meaty in the mouth, smooth and drinkable. I think that if I had the urge, I could down one of these bombers damn quick.  Slick.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,scottum,1.08,"Stick to the Shakespeare! I tried this and I must say that I don't like it. Stouts are some of my favorite brews, but not this stout. It's like Rogue took their awesome Shakespeare brew and spiked it will yucky chocolate. This tastes way too chocolate. There are other flavors going around in there, but the chocolate overpowers. I can see how some could like this, but I do not.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,stegmakk,4.5,"Wow...my first Rogue beer...and what a beer... the only chocolate beer that actually tasted like chocolate but not sweet... Color was black and had a thick very dark tan head that all but dissappeared in a little bit... aroma was coco and chocolate milk like... the taste was a complex mix of real chocolate, a little bitterness and some malt flavors drinkability...great I am definately running back to my store and buying a few more bottles to stow away for later...mmm",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,TheLongBeachBum,4.25,"I have read so much about this beer that when I spied a 22 fl.oz. Bottle recently whilst out beer-shopping, it was immediately purchased without the merest thought. It poured a lovely a deep black color. The head races up the glass as I poured the beer, forming a huge deep brown mass that looks like it belongs in Starbucks. I noted that intense chocolate aromas were already building up into quite a nose before the beer had even finished pouring. The frothy head soon settled to a thin creamy looking brown collar that laced well as it collapsed. Aromas are not surprisingly, of chocolate, but these smells are dominated by cocoa powder and cooking chocolate. First tastes are overwhelmingly of chocolate  real chocolate  which is quite astounding, and this is what differentiates this Chocolate Stout from other wannabes. As the beer reaches its middle the chocolate is dark and strong and lingers. I was expecting this beer to be overtly sickly, it is not, it is not in fact sweet at all. Putting the chocolate tastes aside, the beer has quite a dry bitter finish which I like. Mouthfeel is silky, milky and smooth, it positively coats the mouth. Nicely put together, this is certainly no 10 cent Hershey Bar, but more of a hand-made dark Belgium chocolate.  I am not a huge chocolate fan, my own tastes are spicy rather than sweet, and I am not sure just how much of this I could drink to be honest. One of the better Chocolate Stouts.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,IPA17,4.9,"Rogue has found that secret passage that leads chocolate to beer and meshes them together so perfectly. I love this beer. Went to Andy's Corner in Bogota to hear that it was here, the first keg to hit NJ. Sounded too good to be true. Fortunately, it wasn't. This beer smells fantastic, has a great look and ""feel"" to it, pours with a great head and tastes just like heaven. Willie Wonka and Sam Smith couldn't team up to beat this beer. The only thing that keeps it from becoming a perfect ""5""? It's hard to drink many of them in one sitting. Be that as it may, a beer not to be missed!!!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,AudioGilz,4.48,"22 ounce bottle... The immediate smell as soon as I popped the cap off was bakers chocolate. It poured with a medium sized chocolate milk colored head.  Appearance is super dark like an imperial stout. A stout's appearance doesn't get any better in my opinion.  First taste and yummy! The chocolate taste is coupled along with a slight bitterness and it's very candylike. The chocolate didn't last long in the aftertaste, but the bitterness did without being overwhelming. I pretty much think it tastes like Shakespeare with added chocolate, simple as that. I wasn't much for Shakespeare Stout so I definitely like the smooth chocolatey taste of this one.  The mouthfeel is enjoyable but not quite what I look for in a stout, something like creamy and syrupy it lacks a little bit.  I enjoy the stronger chocolate taste than say Young's Double Chocolate where I thought it wasn't strong enough.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jackndan,4.75,"Rogue Chocolate Stout: In the 22 ounce bomber bottle. A very tall and fluffy head, looking like chocolate sponge cake sits above this absolutely black beer. Even held up to the light, nothing can penetrate this brew. The aroma is pleasant, smelling like dark chocolate. Wow, is that a terrific tasting beer! The beer does have some carbonation, but once the beer settles down, a range of very pleasant malt/chocolate tastes assaults you. In fact, if it is possible, I like the beer better after I&#8217;ve swallowed it, as the chocolate sweetness is full force, and is very tasty. I was very skeptical that this beer belonged in the top ten, but there is no question that this is a great beer. Thank God I let this beer warm up somewhat before sampling it, and you must too.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Wildman,4.1,"I finally got my hands on one of these. They flew off the shelf at Palmers when they got it in. I was lucky to snag one of them. This beer poured black as the night and formed a huge foamy dark tan head the left an almost full coat of lace on the sides as is subsided. Okay, the aroma smells of malt and chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate. Coca comes out the the sweet chocolate to offset it a bit. The flavor was of malt, burnt chocolate and a touch of coffee. The finish was fairly light for this style and had a slight bitterness to it. I prefer this to Young's any day of the week",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,yen157,4.42,"As was expected the beer was as black as night with a tan head like a good stout should. What a smell! Floral cascades mixing with the aroma of dark, rich chocolate. I cant express how rich great the chocolate smelled. The only thing that could have made the nose of the beer better was if there was a toastiness. It would be impossible to miss the bittersweet chocolate ganache flavor of this beer. Its not too sweet, just like dark chocolate should be. Hop flavor mixed well with the cocoa, and there was a complimenting hop bitterness and charcoal notes throughout. As the beer warmed the beer was creamier in the mouth and the hop flavor became more pronounced.  This was my favorite chocolate-containing beer (Brooklyn uses no chocolate in theirs). Much more assertive hop and grain flavors make this a more enjoyable stout than Young's IMO.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Bierman9,4.03,"My first experience with Rogue Choco....it pours a rich, dark brown color, producing a thin, fine tan head. Said-head stays quite thin, and leaves an exemplary touch o' lace! There is an overwhelming chocolate lean to the nose. BIG time!!! Some mocha presents itself, too. This stout is pretty smooth on the tongue, and though above medium body-wise, I felt it could have more oomph there. I know that Rogue has a Mocha Porter, but I pick up huge mocha notes mingled amongst the chocolate here. This bier is very different from most stouts, which are more coffee-like, roasty and drier. It really tastes unlike any stout I can recently recall. Quite nice!!  overall: 4.1 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  459",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,comat0se,4.87,"Chocolate!  Beer pours black as night topped with a creamy smooth, dessert-like tan head. Big time chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt aromas exploding out of the beer. Later on, the aroma reminded me more of a really nice chocolate milkshake. The flavor meets the expectation groundwork laid down by the aroma and appearance. CHOCOLATE! That's what this beer is all about. Dessert malt, coffee, and chocolate flavors with a great mouthfeel to boot. This isn't an overly sweet beer either, but nicely balanced. Next time I'm going to bust out some strawberries with this beer for an experiment in decadence.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Bighuge,4.23,"This beer is black. It is topped with a medium sized dark brown head. It dwindles to an edging within a minute. Smells like dry cocoa powder, coffee and milk chocolate. Right up front, I get the Nestle Quick like chocolate flavor on the palette. There are other flavors at work as well. Burnt tones, bitter hops, roasted barley and oat. Body is full. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. A flavorful beer to be sure. The chocolate actually isn't as overbearing as I thought at first.  Gotta give props to ZAP, Budgood1 and Road Warrior for the combined effort to bring this beer to my presence.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,doho95fu,4.52,"Of the Chocolate stouts I have tried, this one has the strongest chocolate taste, by far. The color is deep brown, with a brown head and no lacing. The smell hits from the minute you open the bottle - chocolate, hops, coffee. The difference with the smell here is that everything smelled fresh, I just wasn't just picking up scents, I was really smelling these things - strong. The taste was chocolatey, with more maltiness than the hops smell would indicate. The beer is really smooth, but seems low on carbonation. Overall, a great beer, but the sweetness and strength of flavor do lower my score for drinkability.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ZAP,4.78,"I am just wrapping up tasting about a dozen of Rogue's beer and this along with the Imperial Stout, Shakespeare Stout, and I2PA are the cream of the crop...  For a chocolate stout the nose is surprisingly devoid of huge cocoa characteristics..more of a nestle quick milk chocolate nose, but also a huge breeze of fresh hops..and a hint of herbal/leather/earthy notes...it looks like I'd expect it to look dark black with a tinge of ruby red on the lace...Mouthfeel is about perfect...creamy...smooth..maybe a tich thin, but for this kind of stout it is probably right on the button...  I think the taste is exceptional...sweet milk chocolate but not overdone...also a nice herbal/leathery hop finsih that adds a real nice characteristic to this beer....  This isn't perfect but it is very close...I still like Youngs a tad better personally but this might be a better made beer...Young's has a bigger chocolate flavor and has very little hop bite...this is more complex and should be a must try for Beer Coniseurs around the globe...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,ElGuapo,4.25,"a beautiful black pour with a nice tan head atop this fine stout. you get a great smell of coffee, chocolate, and a little caramel .  the beer is extremely rich and smooth with a wonderful full body and full flavor. dark malts and coffee flavors take over in the taste of this beer. you will get chocolate kicks here and there, but nowhere near what i had expected. i will say that let me down a little bit. the beer was excellent, but i want more chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,IrishRedRock,4.3,"This is an absolutely kick-ass stout, yet I have to start by saying I was a bit disappointed in the chocolate flavor, I was hoping for a little more. Thats the only flaw I found. Pours nearly black with a thin brown head, and smells of hops and chocolate.  I was impressed with the fact that a chocolate stout managed to have a nice hoppy flavor in addition to everything else going on in this brew. The hops and bitterness seemed to hit me first, with some mild coffee flavors, then finishing with a great, mild chocolate flavor. This is a must have for any stout lover.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,philipt,3.83,"Holy Willy Wonka, Batman! This beer delivers what it promises: chocolate. This is the darkest beer to my recollection. I held it up to a halogen light and could barely see a ruby tint. Anyway, the chocolate favor masks any other ale/stout characteristics.  If you're looking for a chocolate stout, this is your beer!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,mzwolinski,4.88,"Black, with a huge, dark brown, creamy head that sticks around to the very end. Nice aroma of slightly bitter dark chocolate, with a hint of hops as the brew warms. Flavor is just heavenly. This is the most authentic chocolate flavor I've ever encountered in a beer, and it doesn't stop there. Taste develops into a nice understated roasted malt, and finishes with just enough hops to let you know you're still drinking a beer. Finish has a nice mixture of bitterness from three different sources: the grains, the chocolate, and the hops. Really pleasant. Sweet, full-bodied with a decadently creamy mouthfeel. A truly outstanding beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Winter,4.03,"Color was black (opaque) with a thick, rising brown head. Rich sweet chocolatey and malt aroma. Mouthfeel was smooth and very full-bodied. Roasted malt and luscious chocolate flavor dominates midtones. Natural chocolate used in brewing really sets this chocolate stout apart from others. Finish contains bitterness from the hops typical in most of the beers Rogue brews. That's about the only thing that was a slight turn-off. For such a sweet stout, I'm not sure the bitterness of the finish compliments the sweetness of the chocolate. Still it wasn't enough to detract from the overall great taste of this chocolate stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,DarthMalt,3.98,"I have a thing for them cookie-chompin', liter-swillin hippie-chicks!  A little watery on the back end for a stout, but this ranks right up there for Rogue's ""elegance"" line of beers--the other being Hazelnut Brown Nectar. The way Meister Maier wields these extra ingredients, is truly masterful, in my opinion.  And what better way to whip up a REAL chick beer than A) to put a chick on the cover, and B) to put the word ""chocolate"" in the name of the beer. Genius! It's complete, rogue-ish, ""Damn the torpedoes, we're making a real beer for the ladies!"" kind of beer.  And best of all? Guys like it too!  Pours like a stout. Looks like a stout. Tastes like a stout. But it has yummy chocolate in it.  I bet a cookie would go good with this!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Mick,4.75,"Arguably I think most fans of chocolate stout would agree that this one is among the better ones. Coffee black color. Colossal head, very thick and textured, hang on until the end. Sweet chocolate aroma. Crisp roasted mat and chocolate flavors. Crisp and clean finish. A treat!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,frank4sail,4.57,Dark opeque color with a nice thick mocha colored head. Dense and creamy. Chocolate milk scent (MMMMMM) with hints of hop bitterness and roast malt. Bitter dark chocolate taste sours slightly into a smooth roast coco sweetness. The finish is dry and hoppy. More hoppy than you would think. A wonderful after dinner drink.  PS.. Do not drink too cold let it sit and it will improve as it warms. Complex and satisfying.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Lupe,4.68,"Color is jet black with a thich creamy brown head that sticks to the glass. Aroma is of chocolate and more chocolate with milk and roasty malt in the backround. Rich and thick, full bodied and a wondeful creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is chocolate, lots of it and different kinds of tastes. Powered cocoa, dark, bittersweet, milk, and baker's chocolate flavors hit you at different times as you sip. Roasted malt and coffee-like taste is in the backround. Hops and bitterness makes itself known but balances nicely. The balance between them is mind-boggling. Would be interesting to try this at a lower IBU. An excellent stout, richness takes away from the drinkablity, but overall it is wonderful.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,budgood1,4.78,"oh man is this a killer! blacker than black in color, thick and rich, with a big dark tan head that stays forever. piney hops on top of chocolate in the nose. tastes of bitter and sweet chocolate with the usual cascade hop finish. the body of this brew is awesome...bold and heavy, yet silky smooth. how a beer can be so bitter yet oh so smooth is baffling. i'm having a hard time coming up with the right words to accurately describe this brew. so 'absolutely delicious' will have to do. a chocolate lover's delight!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Viking,4.55,"Incredibly dark reddish-brown, as near to black as possible without actually being black. Nice brown head, but it doesn't last quite long enough. Still a bit of lace on top, though. Rich smell of lightly roasted barley, packed with chocolate. Flavor is rich and chocolaty. Combined with the hop bitterness, the taste is somewhat like semisweet chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel, oily finish with a lingering taste of bitter chocolate.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Jon,4.55,"Rogue's take at liquid Godiva, this is one excellent stout. Pours opaque with an impressive, sturdy tan head. Smell is big on chocolate with notes of caramel included, too. Taste is more of the same, with an onslaught of chocolate and a nice hint of Cascade hops along the way. Mouthfeel is chewy, smooth, delectable. For a full-bodied stout of its proportion, this stout is quite drinkable. It's one of the best dessert beers I've come across, and I suggest serving it by itself.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,inebrius,5,"I feel like Augustus Gloop sticking my nose in a river of chocolate, but I survive to take a draught of this rich and chewy brew and find myself in a world of balanced perfection. Pours Siberian new moon black with a gluey, frothy cocoa puff head. Like eating chocolate cupcakes on a cocoa plantation. It's sweet, no, it's bitter, no, hoppy? Oh no. How can a beer be so luscious and drinkable at the same time? A feast for the senses. Majestic!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,zerk,4.25,"Opaque and black, with a thin, but persistant head. Aroma of chocolate and spicy hops. Flavor began with bitter chocolate, became very slightly sweet and fruity, and finished with some underlying earthy hop flavors. Full bodied with low to medium carbonation... smooth and very drinkable. An very good flavored stout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,bditty187,4.13,"Rogue Chocolate Stout was served jet-black with a rich brown head, of a good inch, wonderful lacing as I sipped away. This beer was way more robust than I was expecting. The flavors on the palate were a whopping dose of both roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. This blend added tremendously to the complexity of the Stout; then add in some hops for underlying support. The lack of sweetness was noticeable but not absent. The texture on the tongue was surprisingly creamy. This is a very, very good Stout every BA should try this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,CharlesRiver,4.32,"This is one of the best Chocolate Stout's that I have ever had. Big, bold chocolate flavor that is like drinking desert. Dark as night with a creamy off white head. The rep from Rogue said that they use Dutch chocolate if I remember correctly. This is personally a beer that I probably couldn't have more than two of at one sitting due to the sweetness. I would like to try this out of the bottle but don't know where I could find it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Gusler,4.53,"Ah that magical pour of a well made stout, well heck the worst I ever drank was pert near good. Deep brown to black beauty with a gargantuan head that leaves a latticework of lace behind, the color a magnificent chocolate brown, with a creamy texture. Nose is bittersweet chocolate, coffee, roasted grains, and black patent malts, quite a Sniffer. Front is malt, lightly sweet, the top thick-bodied, the finish, joyously hopped, joyfully acidic, with a bittersweet chocolate dry aftertaste, la bière est magnifique. Ranks #70 on my current 1000 beer master list.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,cokes,4.7,"Wormhole black body with a galactic, nebulous dark brown head. Lasts indefinately, and leaves huge amounts of lace in it wake. Cocoa powder and oaty sweetness on the nose...Maybe hints of vanilla. In the basest of terms, it smells like a Hostess Ho-Ho. Tell me this isn't alluring... First off in the good old roasted malt stouty flavors. In comes the soothing oaty smoothness coupled with a chocolate flavor that rest between dark and milk. Some graininess lies underneath along with some some slight vanilla and carmel tones. At 69 IBU's, this is no slouch in the hops dept. But they only add a bit of citric bitterness at the finale. They do, however, balance the load well. Smooth and gliding across the mouth. Delectable. I don't even care for chocolate that much, but I recognize a treat when I taste one. And this one is a treat. Easily the best chocolate stout I've had.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,hyuga,4.45,"2002 release. Thick black liquid decorated with a creamy, puffy dark tan head. Mouth watering! Stays well too. Bittersweet aroma of hops, cocoa, and dark chocolate. With a taste, first comes hop bitterness, then it evens out with some dark chocolate and roasted grain. Bitter in the middle, but really sweet on the edges of the tongue. Leafy hops in the back. It leaves that leafy character on the tongue as well, I like that. Very smooth and creamy. However, at the end of 22 oz. of this, it gets kind of cloying, so that cuts down on the drinkability. Rogue really put the chocolate in chocolate stout! Using real chocolate was a good idea. Great effort. Too bad this is only seasonal (or is it going year-round now?). Also, thanks to Rogue beers, it's easy for me to identify cascade hops now. I'm not usually a huge fan of cascades used in profusion, but they're nice in this one. Anyway, I definitely want more of this soon!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,NeroFiddled,4.5,"Aged 22 oz. bottle - well over a year old - surprisingly ""fresh"". Very, very dark brown with only minimally visible ruby highlights showing through. The thick, rocky, light brown head holds extremely well and leaves excellent ""spider web"" lace throughout. The aroma is fruity and sweetly chocolatey - very much like sweet cocoa powder. The body is surprisingly full, and givies a very creamy mouthfeel. The flavor starts fruity (raisins, berries), then becomes softly coca-ish, cereal-like and chocolatey as it warms, and finishes astonishingly long with a burst of sweet chocolate, a coffee-like roastiness, and a gently bitter character. A mild but distinctive Cascade flavor eventually emerges once the malt residue has subsided. Wow! Quite a finish. Absolutely worth trying. Easily the best ""chocolate"" beer I've ever had.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,jreitman,4.59,"(on tap, from notes at brewery) Nice jet black color with a thick tan head. Pretty strong chocolate nose. Medium bodied with a very smoothe and creamy mouthfeel.

132,1118,Thrasher,4.48,"Pitch black with huge, puffy, immaculate light tan head. Smells of chocolate (duh) and cream. Like velvet running down the throat. Malt bitterness and substantial hops abutted with chocolate creaminess into a brew that is not overwhelmingly chocolatey but hints of coffee and oats (one of the ingredients). Mouthfeel: velvety, creamy, magnificent, just shy of perfection by being a tad slippery. This is a great beer, as tasty as you would imagine, with only the herbal bitterness keeping it from reeling into the stratosphere.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Jason,4.4,"Jet black colour with a thick bubbly light brown two fingered head, sticks sporadically down the glass. Chocolaty aroma, reminiscent of powdered hot coco  it even goes further with hints of carob with a soft powdery sweetness. Roasted malts are there but restrained in the aroma. Big viscous crispness within the full body and medium carbonation. Big dark chocolate flavours with a dark fruitiness in the middle similar to black berries, maltiness is big but the roasted flavours are humble yet generous with a mild bitterness from the bite. The blend of roasted malts and chocolate flavour make for a bitter sweet flavour likened to baker chocolate. Hops are held to a minimum though are certainly present with earthy undertones that complement the roasted flavours.  As far as flavoured stouts go this is one of the best, very well balanced and quite drinkable for a brew with such a big body.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,Todd,4.58,"Presentation: On tap @ Bukowski's in Boston.  Appearance: Pitch black with a milky coffee head -- thick, creamy and invincible!  Smell: Major chocolate aromas. Soft. Milky.  Taste: Creamy, smooth, full-bodied, but not overly rich. Burnt around the edges of the palate. Touch of bitterness that blends with some smoke characters. Loads of real chocolate flavour, which dominates the entire tasting. Dry. Very little sweetness, but what is there is date-like with hints of black-strap molasses. Surprisingly light going down, given its rich name and appearance.  Notes: Chocolate!! The only thing you can think of is ... chocolate. And, you should as unlike other ""chocolate"" labeled beers that use chocolate malts to achieve the flavour, this beer is brewed with natural chocolate flavour, and chocolate malts.  Truly an exceptional beer, and it makes for a perfect dessert on its own, or pair it with one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92

132,1118,Brent,4.32,"We're not talking chocolate malt here - we're talking real chocolate. I almost expected to see a half-dissolved Hershey bar clinking around in the bottle after I poured out the last of the beer. Pour was thick and black, like used motor oil (only a stout lover could find this description appetizing). Creamy and chock-full of mocha chocolate, like a chocolate creme soda. I'm a fan of Young's Luxury Double Chocolate Stout, but Young's is no match for this chocolate monster. My only ding against this Rogue is the drinkability factor. A little of this beer went a long way for me, and toward the end the chocolate became cloying and just too much. A great dessert beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",American Stout,92
132,1118,aracauna,4,"Rogue can do stouts and that's all there is to it. Not as good as the Shakespeare stout, but good.
