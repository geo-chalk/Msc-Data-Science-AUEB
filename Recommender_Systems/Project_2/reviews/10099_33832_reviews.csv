I’ve had this fabulous elixir on tap and in bottles, yes, stood in front of the palo santo wood barrel at the brewery too. One of the best and most unique beers I’ve ever had. Savored even. It will continue to be missed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,sulldaddy,4.13,"Im sampling this 12 oz bottle at cellar temp poured into my snifter. This bottle is about 7 years old and has been in my cellar for most of its life. The beer pours black coffee color with no light passing through the glass. Very minimal tan head foams up and remains a thin edge layer throughout sampling. I leave maybe a ml in the bottle as there are some sediment chunks that Im not interested in. The aroma is rich and complex malt profile. I get brown sugar, some vanilla, and rich woody notes. I also get a little booze and hints of port in the background. I also do get just a wisp of oxidation cardboard buried. glad I opened now and not next year! First sip reveals a medium body with mild yet still slightly tingly carbonation. Texture is definitely sticky and coats my lips and palate with each sip. Flavor is deep malt with brown sugar, some tobacco, dark cocoa powder, and wood. Finish actually also has a little dark fruit and some booze. No hop character anywhere and I dont get any oxidation on the flavor profile. I do find this to be a sipping beer due to the texture and slight booziness on the finish. Interesting and enjoyable, but I need to go back and get a fresh bottle to remind myself of what it tastes like without aging.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,EMV,4.31,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip  L: Dark, dark brown pour... nearly black with a finger of off-white head.  S: Rich and roasty... wood, smoke, oak, and toasted grains.  T.F: Just like it smells. Rich and semi-sweet. Strong oak and wood. Spice, a bit of smoke, earth, and toasted grains. Aromatics... vanilla, spice, coffee, and cocoa. Medium bodied... smooth and creamy. Warming... ABV hidden.  O: An outstanding Imperial Brown ale... great flavor, and it really picks up the wood/smoke/aromatics.

10099,33832,jemsdelajems,4.81,"Instead of the strict five point review format, I'm just gonna tell it like it is.  This beer is and in-depth, syrupy mouthful of deliciousness, especially when comparing it to your average pint of not-nearly-as-heavy brown ale. I bought a 4 pack of bottles on a trip (bottled 10/09/20, drinking it on 1/8 and drinking it at whatever appropriate temperature for this type of beer, fuck fussing about degrees F) and it's an excellent beer. Very little noticeable carbonation and all of those dank, roasty, delicious flavors I love in a brown ale whether exceptionally heavy or as light as newcastle.  For sure, worth an excellent review in my eyes",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,blazerkor,4.44,It smells like a sweet steaming loaf of decadent brown bread on some exotic wooden cutting board with a bottle of smokeless scotch opened just next to it.  It has the taste of a ball of dough rolled in rich and bitter cocoa nibs. Once that slightly fades you can taste some wood that a little alcohol has been spilled on.  It feels smooth like hot cocoa down to the fact that it warms your mouth with the high alcohol content. Mild carbonation prickles a little and when you swallow you're left with a dry and clean bitterness.  Overall it's really interesting. I like it and it's unique. I give it a 5.3 out of 6.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,milkshakebeersucks,4.13,"Deep brown appearance with a large, dense, tan head and good lacing. Aroma is a mix of molasses, chocolate and vanilla extract over the wood. Sweet, roasted malt flavors along with some dark fruit. Hops take their time to clock in and you may have to wait a bit for them to register. Full bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel.

10099,33832,JohnFred4,4.86,"look: so brown it's block, a frothy, lively head  smell: one of the best parts. the palo santo marron wood of course gives it some woody scent (redwood? rosemary?), but also a very savory char. like a BBQ smoker  taste: soy sauce, barbecue sauce, salami, rosemary, thyme, sage. i can't get over how savory this is. i don't even get a ton of acutal oak or wood, it just tastes like someone stacked their smoker with some very tasty wood, and made a bunch of meat. it's not a campfire beer, it's a barbecue beer, in that it tastes like a whole meal  feel: not hot at all, thick and syrupy. minimal carbonation.  overall: special place in my heart. i love meal beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Pours a dark black brown, little head or lacing, chocolate foam barely on the glass. Smells the rich, boozy tableau of a pastry stout. But the taste is where the aging went wrong. We veered past mellow and straight into deterioration and astringency. Ah, well. At least I'll have a headache tomorrow.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Rug,4.2,"Bottles 4/24/20  I actually set one of these aside in the cellar before drinking a freah one, pretty sure it’s a 2019 and I plan on drinking it next year for my college graduation  Pours a rich dark brown with a finger of khaki head that reduces to a cap and leaves minimal lacing  Aromas of toasted malt, caramel, vanilla, and light milk chocolate. Really just a touch of oak but nothing spectacular  The taste starts off charred, more roasty like a stout. Some intense vanilla and rich malt with dark roast coffee. The milk chocolate comes out on the finish  Quite the light feel for a brown but still full in flavor with moderate carbonation leads to a smooth and nearly dry finish  This was not exactly what I was expecting, I wanted my mind to be blown. I guess that ones on me, but I’ve heard it gets better with age. I’ll have to set aside other beers for graduation too, but this will be nice ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, the day has finally come. I graduated from college with a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering earlier today (okay, yesterday really) and now it's time to whip out a bottle of this I've had for a while dated 4/12/19. Let's dive right in  Still looking the same in color but with a slightly bigger head and more lacing (3.75->4)  Holy hell, the wood in this older bottle is significantly more present. I'm picking up on aromas of toasted oak, pecan, creamy vanilla, espresso beans, brown bread, and subtle milk chocolate (4.25->4.5)  Honestly this tastes pretty similar to what I have noted from the fresh bottle, just a little less roasty and charred. Maybe it could actually use some more time in this regard (4->4)  The body remains identical here, but I do think it deserves a slight bump up from before (4->4.25)  Overall this has to go (4->4.25). This definitely impressed me more than it did initially, but I think setting another bottle aside would be fun to see how the taste evolves",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

With that being said sometimes it’s too over the top and that’s the case with this brown ale. I’ve never seen a Brown Ale with such a high ABV. It’s too over powering and doesn’t drink like any brown ale I’ve had. Honestly if they toned this down a bit , could be a really amazing brown.

10099,33832,Chaotic_Brown,3.05,"Pouring this out you immediately notice this it not your average Brown Ale. Very dark with very pungent smells of malts and oak. The head is a dark tan and fades fast First sip lets you know that this is high alcohol. Nothing about this ale hides it's potency. There's flavors of malts, oak, maybe fruits and the high carbonation gives the earthly flavors a bit more punch but not in a good way. Overall the flavor is masked by the alcohol, which is a distraction. I was disappointed in the flavors and the texture as it didn't fit into what I would consider a brown ale. I would say that those who like the barrel age beers might like the stronger smells and flavors.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,DokiDokiLitFam,4.24,"Poured aggressively. Finger of head. Faded quickly.  Nose is malt and wood predominantly. Other smoky notes peeking in. Heavy malt for a brown ale.  Taste is malt and wood fighting for dominance. After the fade, it transitions to roasty coffee notes and subtle bitter chocolate. This is a very slow sipper to be getting these flavors. Take your time as this is a 12%.  Mouthfeel is full with mild carbonation. Smooth, nice.  Not quite as impactful as Underground Mountain Brown, but has a nice warmth and subtlety.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Amendm,4.18,"A moderate pour from a 12-oz. bottle yields a finger of khaki creamy and lumpy foam with long retention and small blotches of lace. Opaque stout-like dark brown, lighter brown highlights.  Rich smell of vanilla, caramel malt in front of toasted malt and bread. Light roasted malt and grainy wheat. Very faint herbal hops and alcohol. These follow to taste and are bigger.  That 12% ABV is the first taste, it is quickly moderate by the rich malt. Semi-dry and averagely bitter at first, an attempt at sweetness from baked pitted fruits fails. Daringly bold malt remains in Russian Imperial Stout-like style as it drys a little while peppery alcohol, hops and roasted malt bitterness builds to pretty high at the long finish. The aftertaste is long and mirrors the finish.  Full bodied and well carbonated, somehow manages to be smooth as a sipper. The booze is so much bigger in the taste than the smell. This pushes the boundaries of the style, a perfect case for an Imperial Brown style being added. This beer would be a contender for Ranked #1.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

As for the aroma seems to be a lil' on the sweet side, maybe like a cherry coke...with a hint of the wood aged coming thru. The taste is what i think is a lil' different, but follows the nose...I remember it a tad bit smoother. It does still follow the nose... with a little more of the wood age coming through...and the cherry coke in the background, and the ABV is very well hidden.

Perfect traditional brown look, deep dark cherry and mahogany color, with a brief, pretty cafe au lait head. The rich fragrance hits the nose with a sweet medley of plum jam, chocolate, salty earthy tones and much more. Then the amazing flavor is Chapter 2, not so much adding to the aroma as following it with another burst of flavors, just as varied and entirely different. Char, cocoa and raisins predominant early, then give way to fresh brown bread and honey notes.

Taste is extra rich malty caramel, toffee, molasses blended with fig, prune, woody vanilla, dark chocolate and coffee backed by a roasted, lightly burnt character; alcohol prominence in the latter half of the sip with a nice bite in the finish and bittersweet aftertaste.

A: pours a dark brown, bordering on black with a thin skim of head that rapidly dissipates to nothing more than an island in the center. Held up to a bright light nothing is coming through except at the very margins. Some tiny carb showing there at the edge, but nothing else.  S: sweet, syrupy, boozy nose. Caramel, molasses. Maybe my imagination, but I think I smell some wood. Really does smell like a mild, less roasty RIS.  T: arrives with an immediate, mouth filling sweetness. Complex fruit sugars: molasses, dried fig, prune, blood, tobacco, oak. Lingering licorice, vanilla, molasses, tobacco, and then oak. There is a bit of malt roast here, but it is very mild. Like a breakfast blend coffee. Alcohol is not present on the palate nearly as much as you would expect, but it appears toward the end and lingers on the finish. I bought this not knowing that it was nearly two years old. I wonder if this is one that is better fresh?  M: what do you think it feels like? Motor oil. Thick and syrupy, but with adequate carbonation. Fairly clean, but there is a lingering flavor, of not texture.  O: it’s damn near 100 degrees out today, but this has been sitting in my fridge for months, and I figured hey, it’s now or never. I’ve had RIS’s in hot weather before, and so that isn’t the source of my ambivalence. Really, it’s that this is overpoweringly sweet and boozy, and lacking in either hop or roast bitterness to balance it out. I find this true of many barrel-aged beers; perhaps I’m just not a fan of barrel aging beer (I love whisky, though). A definite sipper, best for the winter months and when you have nothing to do and nowhere to be. For me, a one and done. I wanted to have tried it, so I tried it.

The head and lacing persist fairly well.  The nose is fairly malty and toasty, with expected wood notes. The booze is noticeable here.  The flavor is all over the map. Big chewy malts in the form of caramel and molasses immediately hit the palate, followed by a strong raw booze note. Earthy hop notes balance the malts fairly well, though this skews pretty sweet. Very barleywine-like or even old ale, with a barrel note that arrives in the aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is solid and well-matched. Definitely chewy and full-bodied, it nevertheless delivers just enough hop and booze to balance things out. And the carbonation is unexpected given the ABV.  This isn't a ""brown"" in the conventional sense at all. Very barleywine in many ways, although less hoppy than most iterations of that style. If the booze was a bit more hidden it would be a top-notcher. Still, a good brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Completely overpowers the taste of this delicious shrimp queso flameado dish in a good way. A definite winner with props much deserved. Crazy that the shop has 2 year old 4 packs just sitting there. At a reasonable price too. Thanks again DF.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Brenden,4.19,"L: I've never seen a brown that looked so much like a porter or possibly even a stout. It's very dark brown and just a bit of light adds some color to the body. The head is a smallish, thin one but tightly bubbled, leaving spotting on the glass behind a thin leg. S: You can smell a bit of alcohol, but the barrel adds a lot of character. Good wood with some caramel and vanilla sweetness over a bit of light roast. T:This one is balanced, not too sweet, and very tasty. The only thing that detracts is the strength of the raw sort of alcohol, and this might be the perfect brown ale without it. As such, it's excellent, with lots of complexity, bread and just enough of a leafy / earthy / almost nutty hops presence to counter the sweetness. Wood adds a nice dryness that doesn't take it overboard or go astringent. F: This is one that could be very dry, and overly so, between the alcohol and wood but doesn't. It has a bit more body than the typical brown without being heavy and balances crispness and smoothness very nicely.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,OldManStanford,4.04,"I keep finding myself coming back to this beer time and again. Especially after my local Whole Foods in the Bay Area started carrying it.  The color is dark, maybe even dank, especially for a brown ale. It feels thick as it pours, and ends up with a nice, even layer of foam on the head.  The aroma comes across with caramel and toasted nuts (almonds, perhaps). Of course, those caramel-coated nuts are surrounded by the smell of the wood! Wonderfully deep and complex.  The taste is heavy and warm, filled with notes of caramel and molasses. The high ABV isn't something you notice on the way in, but after one, I'm always thinking why I don't do that more often.  Overall, it's absolutely worth and taste and something I think is worth coming back to.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Harrison8,4.51,"Pours black with a finger and half of khaki foam with marvelous head retention. Aroma is toasted, nutted, breaded, and caramel malts with soothing oak. Flavor profile is toasted, roasted, nutted, breaded, and caramel malts. It has a wonderfully diverse quality to it, all the while, remaining balanced. Touches of caramel, oak, and molasses help smooth things out even further burying any sign of the 12% ABV. Mouth feel is velvety, smooth, and creamy with a medium thickness. Overall, a splendid beer that retains a world class balance. It drinks quite a bit like a stout, but a balanced stout at that. Lovely brew.

Minimal lacing. Body rather resembles cherry cola, as well; maybe a shade darker. Smells warm and oaky and boozy, like it was bourbon barrel aged rather than simply oak aged. Taste is all over the place. You're hit with malts and woody overtones upfront, but the back end is doing a big imperial stout impression with leather and tobacco notes. Body is a bit thinner than you'd think, but that may be a good thing. This is a brew that, I reckon, benefits from the potability. Carbonation is almost completely gone at this point as well, but I don't view that as a drawback. Your mileage may vary.

10099,33832,HorseheadsHophead,4.79,"Well, it looks pitch black in the glass, topped by a creamy tan head. Looks more like an imperial stout than a brown ale. The head retention and lacing are incredible for an abv of 12%, so it looks magnificent.  It smells like an imperial stout, too. It smells like dark chocolate, baking cocoa, espresso, licorice, molasses, black pepper. Slightly butter, too, with hints of soy sauce. Smells delectable.  Huge dark and milk chocolate upfront with some caramel and toffee. Big creaminess with vanilla and almond notes. Spicy mid-palate notes of black pepper, licorice, star anise. Slightly smoky. Hints of prune and raisin. A little bit of soy sauce. Finishes slightly sweet but not cloying, alcohol extremely well-hidden, just a warmth going down.  The mouthfeel on this beer is world-class. So silky-smooth, soft, and velvety. Super creamy, but not thick, chewy, or heavy. Moderately carbonated. Flows quickly on the palate but doesn't want to leave your mouth, either. Finishes slightly sticky with some residual sweetness.  Wow! This beer blew my mind.

I knew there was something special about this beer when I read it was a brown ale but it poured out more like a liquid, black stout. It had thin foam, light lacing, but the impenetrable blackness of the beer was impressive. The scent was a pleasant blend of caramel, roasted notes, and the distinct booziness that comes with 12% ABV. Mouthfeel was full-bodied, somewhat creamy, and more carbonated than I prefer but not to the point of distraction. The taste was anything like a brown ale - this was more a flavorful stout if anything. Though the booziness was the strong note, there were background flavors of vanilla and caramel, with a touch of roasted malts to round it all up.

Flavors of mocha vanilla, oak toffee, caramel that is not added to the beer but rather a result from the Palo santo wooden barrels it aged in.

This brown ale tastes and feels more like a barley wine to me - not a bad thing at all. DFH really seems to like adding hops to their beers - lots of hops. The hops are here too - but they do not overpower. Rather, they lend a welcome balance to the malt.  With a butt-kicking 12% ABV, this is a definite sipper, and probably more appropriate for warming a person up on a chilly autumn or winter evening rather than here in June. But I love dark, rich, flavorful beers all year around.  Chocolate notes are apparent in the flavor, and a bit less so in the aroma. The mouthfeel is wonderfully creamy, and the carbonation is just enough to tickle the throat.

Okay, so it's been a while since I've reviewed anything, as I am a busy man and don't necessarily care to much for a review after a long dat at work, so here I am, reviewing a vintage of one of my favorite beers. Palo Santo (means ""holy tree"") Marron is a delicious, rich but subtle brown ale aged on Palo Santo wood, which is used in many South American wines. Pouring a deep midnight black, with a subtle light brown head of about a pinky's width, this beer unleashes aromas of wood, vanilla, dark fruit and chocolate, which evolve into a mix that is not only subtle, but wonderful as well.  The taste follows suit, with rich flavors of chocolate, vanilla, wood and dark fruit, but in a much more stated amount than the aroma would have you believe. As it warms, the wood becomes much more prominent without overpowering the softer notes. A definite after work sipper, perfect with a beef stew or smoked cheese.  For a two year vintage, this beer has held up incredibly well. I'm always happy to see such beer aging on shelves, more for me and those who enjoy aged ales.

Light lacing  Smells like coffee and maybe light tobacco.  Flavor is what i would call wood aged imperial porter(or stout). Most brown ales dont touch the abv or darkness this beer has. Very enjoyable to me as I love high abv dark beers in general.  Mouthfeel isnt thin, but surprisingly drinkable for a high octane brown. I could see drinking more than one if offered the opportunity.  Next time I buy these, I'll get one 4 pack to drink and one to age. It's that good. If you like high powered stouts, give this a try (even though it's labeled as a brown) At least try a single, dogfish head don't mess around.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,andrewh995,4.37,"Beautiful pitch black color. Smells of milk chocolate, wood, and coffee. Getting coffee, tons of chocolate and vanilla, as well as some spices and barrel wood on the palate. Very thick and syrupy for the mouthfeel. Not an easy drinker but sure a good one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,q33jeff,2.57,"** 04/13/17  Bottle to snifter.  I had this 6-7 years ago before I started recording most of my ratings, but I remember thinking it had an odd taste and I did not like it. Trying it this time, I think it's not as off-putting as before, but I still don't love it. I appreciate the strength and also the experimentation with the Brown Ale style which I like. Glad I tried it again  LOOK: very dark brown (almost black). Medium head fades quickly into some minor lacing. AROMA: the wood dominates, maybe some vinegar or strange oils. Some roasted malt. TASTE: a touch of raisin comes through, but otherwise it is the wood and strong oily taste which I can only imagine comes from the Palo Santo wood. FEEL: Medium to Full bodied. Light carbonation due to thickness. Smooth mouthfeel, but some astringency from the wood characteristics.   ** 12/13/18  Bottle to sniffer.  Giving this another shot. Mostly because I want to see what some age will do. This bottle is the 1st of a 4pack, bottled 10/24/18.  I agree with my notes from above, but maybe I was a bit harsh on the numbers.  this is a pretty good beer that is , at this point in its life, a little rough around the edges and unrefined. Hoping age will mellow it. The 12% should allow quality aging. **",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,spursfaninla,4.22,"This beer brings the flavor, with the barrel aging setting it apart from most browns I have had. Honestly, it tastes closer to an imperial IMO. Gaudy flavor for a brown, closer to stouts, which may be good depending on what you are looking for.  Color, smell are standard for a brown; good. It is a great beer for your 3rd of the night; you can still taste it, strong, memorable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Brian_in_Baltimore,4.75,"Great dark beer. It's a whole lotta mouth feel and not a light easy drinker, but wow. Look: dark, thick, syrupy in appearance smell: great aroma of malt and carmel taste: reminds me of the goose island bourbon county stout. complex tastes, a little chocolate a little vanilla feel: thick, big body, boozy beer.

10099,33832,captaincoffee,4.08,"Pours like a imp stout...near black with short but thick and creamy brown head with good retention and lace. Nose is sweet roasted malt, a bit like brown bread and some woody notes. Taste is on the sweet side like a barleywine. Not overly boozy for 12%, although I've had this mellowing in the cellar for a year. Vanilla, chewy raisin, and again a light woody note. Overall, a good beer, but I was hoping for a bit more complexity rather than just going big on the malt and ABV. I'd certainly call this a barleywine and not a brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

And technically a Brown Ale at that!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Pretty thick beer.  Smell: Rich and malty. Caramel, chocolate, coffee, and some earthiness (wood).  Taste: Heavy hitter. Huge flavors of chocolate and coffee. Very rich caramel... like an extra thick Porter. Some spiciness (possibly Rye?). Hints of vanilla and bourbon. The bitterness upfront is surprising. Some from hops, and some probably from the dark roasted grains. Very complex!! and woody beer. Hight ABV - decent alcohol burn. Different flavors with every sip.  Feel: Very thick and full bodied.  Overall: Amazing beer. Can't imagine the flavor being better for this one. Lacking some carbonation maybe. So complex and it only got better as it warmed and got closer to room temperature.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,SHDoyle,4.22,"Description: Deep brown color with very little head or lacing. Almost looks like a brown stout. Smell is a big hit of wood...which I guess is palo santo wood? Spicy, cinnamon, caramel aroma follows. Taste is similar with caramel, wood, vanilla and smoky/woody finish. For a beer with this high of an ABV, the alcohol isn't very noticeable. There's a spice element on the taste as well with a little bit of heat. Moutfeel is think and velvety. Very smooth and stout like.  Suggested food pairing: Enchiladas with mole sauce  If you like this beer then you should also try: Founders Imperial Stout  Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely have it again) When I hear ""brown ale"" I usually envision an unhopped, boring, uninspired beer. This was anything but. Full of flavor and flavors that you don't find too often. It really reminded me more of a stout than a brown ale.

Ithe has a little bit of a nonbeer bite like liquor that I am not a fan of, but it is still a nice beer, one bottle would be my limit for a night. Probably because it's 12% that's a good thing. I think it would be great with a cigar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,DovGibor,4.64,"Poured from a bottle dated 8/5/16 into a tall snifter glass. Forms a thick brown head that lingers for a few minutes. Color is dark brown to black. Not completely opaque, but close. Aroma is rich malt sweetness and distinctive wood notes. It's not oak (obviously), but it's difficult to describe the difference. Less tree sap aroma more sweetness maybe; closer to applewood. I do not detect anything I would attribute to hops.  The flavor is rich and smooth. Light roast and dark wood without significant bitterness. Reminds me of a rich mole sauce, minus any heat spiciness. I had expected some sweetness based on the malt and wood aromas, but this is dry. Not bone dry, but drier than other high ABV brown ales I've had. And drier than many of Dogfish's other big beers. Mouthfeel is great. It coats the mouth and tickles the tongue, and it lingers a bit, but not more than I'd want it to.  Overall, I'm not sure I'd call this a brown ale, but I definitely call it a great ale. It does unique things, and it does them well. I don't get to pick this up often, but when I do I kick myself for not buying more. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

At this point, I thought all my DFH jokes were blowing up in my face, this is a nice beer to start out thus far.  The taste though hits like a shot of cheap whiskey. Hot. Like that water sealant you use on your wooden deck. Just really the alcohol cuts through this one hot and heavy, the viscosity of the beer doesn't seem to be enough to hold up. I like the aroma and what it shows you can do with barrel aging, but beyond that its a rough one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,BIGPOPPAS,4.44,"One of my favorites from Dogfish Head . If you love a rich, dark and heavy brew with tons of flavor then this is one of them for sure .

10099,33832,BCad,4.29,"L: Dark, very dark in fact. Thin white head, decent lacing.  S: Smells phenomenal. Deep woody caramel sweetness with a hint of booziness. Almost characteristic of a light roasted coffee bean. (And i'm usually not the kind of guy that cares about or ever notices smells in a beer, so this is saying something I suppose.)  T: Lots of complexity here. Deffinitely a forward biting chocolate malt flavor, but the first thing you taste really is what I would imagine aged wood would taste like, very similar to how I described the smell. Earthy, deffinitely boozey, and very malt-forward though there is a good amount of bitterness.  F: Thick, rich, and creamy. Plenty of carbonation despite the thin look of the head on the pour.  O: If you like malt-forward dark beer that is boozy and off-character or unique, grab yourself a couple of these and go to town! These guys are deffinitely sipping beers, and the flavor profiles more bordered along the lines of a smooth scotch in complexity.

This FINE ale pours a deep blackish brown with a nice head of light tan foam that settles to a thick ring, thin layer, and excellent lacing. Nose of vanilla, creme brule, toffee, subtle cocoa, and strong booze. Flavors exceed the nose with toffee and butterscotch on the front and sides, wooded notes from the barrel hit middle of the taste with cocoa and creme brule taking over the rear of the taste with notes of fresh brewed strong coffee. Excellent mouth feel, warming, full, and boozy with a chocolatey, barrel touched, booze characteristic. Excellent!

A-The beer is very dark for a brown ale; it looks more like a stout. The pour is heavy and oily coming out of the bottle. A short, tan head fades quickly.  S-The aroma is a very enticing mixture of milk and dark chocolate, dark caramel, a little bit of sour cherry, and this unique herbal, cedar-like woody smell. I'm not sure how it works, but I'm really intrigued. A little alcohol heat is noticeable too.  T-The taste opens with a little wave of fruity sweetness; I think cherries and plum. Then an earthy wave of chocolatey malts kicks in. I taste carob, vanilla, and milk and dark chocolates. The finish dries out a bit with that same intriguing oaky/cedar-like note. Complex and layered. The beer is 12% ABV, and you can taste the alcohol, but the alcohol is integrated well.  M-The body is thick and robust on the palate with a fine persistent carbonation. Like a stout more than a brown.  O-Wow. This beer was a pleasant surprise: complex, unique, and tasty. I know that DFH makes some classic high-ABV beers that have fallen out of favor in recent years, but this beer can keep up with anything the new kids are putting out.

Nose is complex and a little different with each sniff; dark fruit, smoked meat, oak, vanilla, fresh cream, and the whole thing reminds me distantly of Grand Marnier.  Never thought that 50 IBUs could hide so effortlessly. The malt is overpowering, tinged with wood and plum notes. The alcohol is present but not kicking as high as you'd think for a beast of this size. Texture is firm and low in carbonation, which works pretty well. Aftertaste is surprisingly mellow and balanced.  I couldn't see more than one, most likely as a nightcap. Also, to me this is much more in line with an Old Ale than a Brown, but nobody asked me.

10099,33832,Beginner2,4.21,"Besides ""How does Dogfish do that?"", three questions define this brew for me.  First, how can 50 IBU taste sweet ? (Probable answer: with a craftily roasted malt bill.)  Second, why do stouts aged in bourbon barrels taste first like vanilla and then ale; yet this brown ale tastes like it should. (Probably answer: Palo Santo doesn't take the easy route to popular Taste and limits its barrel-aging.)  Third, How does Dogfish Head take improbable sounding beers and, reasonably consistently, produce thoughtful and interesting beers ? (Probable answer that also is a cop-out: they are brewing geniuses !)  Much more can be said about this interesting, wonderful brew.

A bit more of a gusher than I expected, with an aggressive pour yielding half a glass of thick, dense tan foam that left lots of attractive lacing as it settled to a thin ring. Best at just above cellar temperature, when the aromas and flavors seem to peak. This draws you in with warm, inviting notes of caramel, vanilla, chocolate, and black cherry. Quite sweet on the palate, with very low bitterness and no trace of char. There is some lingering sweetness on the finish, along with a touch of woody sourness. There is also a bit of alcohol warmth, but it is quite understated for such a big beer. Lip-smackingly delicious and well crafted. Proceed with caution!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,jzeilinger,4.22,"A - Very dark opaque brown pour with a very, very thick creamy mocha colored head. The creamy layer of head sticks to the sides of the glass like glue, viscous.  S - Wood, light smoky char, vanilla, toasted caramel malt, and cream.  T - Very boozy from start to finish and the very first nuance to pond your palate. Some smoky malt, toasted caramel toffee (but very subdued), wood character all the way through, vanilla, chocolate, a touch of mocha. Finishes with a very slight mocha bitterness but mostly sweet and boozy on the back end.  M - Although very boozy it never gets overly hot, just warm. Very creamy on the tongue,  O - Not a fan of Brown Ales by any means but really enjoyed this one - maybe because it pushes the boundaries and showcases the potential of a Brown Ale. Underrated. Definitely worth a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,AmeriCanadian,4.29,"Outstanding beer that, when compared against the general American Brown Ale population (how it's categorized here at Beer Advocate), really stands in a league of its own. Pours almost black with a thick, sticky, mocha head that laces well. Smell is molasses, booze, dark fruits, a pleasant oak (or a darker wood?), and appealing vanilla. Taste is baker's chocolate, brown sugar, the perfect amount of oak and darker wood, caramel, and vanilla. Feel is thick, rich, and sticky. Alcohol is definitely there -- pleasant boozy burn -- but not in any way overwhelming. Again, comparing this beer to normal browns is just unfair. But it also stands out among more comparable wood-aged browns that end up over-oaked or lacking in congruity. This beer is fantastic.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

The head is thick, dark tan, dense and thick, in fact the beer even pours out thicker than most ales, which helps create the thick dense head. There’s a patch of small fluffy bubbles gathered in the middle, and all of this is rounded up by a nice dense lacing. Smell: Caramel, apples, toffee, roasted malts, mild fig and grapes and dates. Mild spices can be detected. Taste: heavy on the roasted malts and the alcohol is up front. As it hits the middle of your mouth, it gets a little nutty and the spices come out just a bit.

10099,33832,Sabtos,4.74,"Viscous black with vibrant mahogany edges and a dense mocha head--if ever there was a Stout disguised as a Brown Ale, this is it.  Oh my god the aroma of this is just a trance inducing walk through the desert. Chocolate malt, vanilla, molasses and coffee are quickly overcome by the amazing effect the Palo Santo wood gives off--a fresh green yet anciently aged sort of cedar with a smoked salt and peppery bite.  Taste is nearly identical to the smell which has me bowing down to the Dogfish Head idol. Molasses and chocolate are very well accompanied by the amazingly delicious Palo Santo wood element--I just don't understand how this tastes so good.  This puppy is bigger, more substantial, bossier, heavier, and more killer than any Porter I've ever had, and puts to shame half of the beers out there that feign to call themselves Stouts--and Dogfish calls this a Brown. Soft and frothy with a slight dry woody grit that feels just right for the attributes this beer gives off.  This is mind blowingly delicious and unbelievably unique. Seriously, there is nothing else on the market anywhere close to capturing the cedary scent and flavor that this does, while still seeming like a consumable product.  One of the best beers around.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Looks great. Smell begins with malt, chocolate, raisins, dates, a slight wine aroma, plums, some wood, a little burnt sugar. Smells pretty good, too. Taste also leads with light roast malt, less chocolate than the nose, caramel, raisins, figs, some wine, more wood than the nose. Light alcohol, a little bitterness on the back end. This is good stuff. Smooth, full bodied, well carbonated, a little creamy.  One hell of a beer. The Palo Santo wood adds a great, unique flavor. So much going on here with both the aroma and taste.

10099,33832,BlushingMonk,4.16,"This would be better labeled a porter in my opinion. Brown ale is too broad a term to give much indication of what's really in the bottle.

Aroma is full of activity with brown sugar, molasses, alcohol, roasted dark malts, leather, raisins, figs, dry red wine, and something sharp and sweet comes out the more you keep your nose in it.  Big roasted flavor pairs with dark chocolate, raisins, alcohol, and acidic coffee.

10099,33832,m_hall,4.53,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip. Deep, dark coffee brown, almost black, completely opaque. Head is thin, chocolate-brown, and falls slowly to a film. Lacing is sparse.  Nose has prominent woody notes, vanilla, toasted malts, and alcohol, with smokey/spicy highlights. A very aromatic beer.  Flavors are very bold... big oak-like woody notes right up front from the aging in exotic Palo Santo wood vats. Beneath that there are deep roasted/bittersweet chocolate malt flavors, molasses, dark fruits and dried berries. Alcohol follows in, but not in an overbearing way. Finish is a lingering mix of spicy tones, almost like some red wines; smoke, blended with subtle earthy hops.  Mouthfeel is very rich, chewy, viscous and mouth-coating. The heaviness in texture combined with the high ABV (12%) places this one firmly into the category of a ""sipper."" The decent level of carbonation does give it just a touch of tingle on the palate.  A somewhat experimental beer from a company known for such things, this DFH offering was quite a discovery. It's classed as a brown ale here, though that's perhaps a bit misleading... think more along the lines of a Belgian Strong Dark or even an Imperial Stout and you're getting a better idea of what this is like. With the high ABV, this one should age well; I'm planning to put a few up for a while and see how it evolves.

10099,33832,Myotus,4.18,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled 21Apr15) into a pint glass. Pours with a finger's worth of cinnamon colored foam that dissipates into a quarter's worth of khaki foam within 2 minutes (great diissioation rate and lovely color transformation). Beer is black in color with with a difficult-to-see maroon tint and no perceivable bubbles both due to how black the brew is. Lacing is moderate. Has mild aromas alcohol (ewwwwww!!!!!), molasses, figs, and vanilla and a hint of caramelized malt, sweet chocolate, and oak (I know it's actually the Palo Santo wood, but it smells like oak) aromas. Initial taste is of strong molasses and fig flavors that entangle with mild alcohol and oak (Palo Santo wood) flavors. As all flavors persist, mild vanilla flavors along with hints of choclate finish out the taste. Very full-bodied with a nigh syrupy feel that clings to the back of the throat. Has a subtle carbonation and goes down smooth. For those of you know me, I do not appreciate the perception of alcohol. Everything else being said, this was one heck of a brown ale. NOTE: Unlike most brown ales which become more enjoyable as they warm up, this becomes unpleasant due to the alcohol presence becoming stronger.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,ryan1788a5,4.23,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 10/4/2011 date means this is approaching four years of age.  A: In the glass it sits the darkest shade of brown. Creamy brown head initially sits at a half inch, but settles shortly. It can be revived by swirling the glass. Spotty lacing.  S: Rich aromas of sticky blackstrap molasses and dark rum. Hazelnut fudge. Carob. Dark chewy caramel and vanilla extract. Very sweet. Some wet paper bag reveals the age. Woody. Fig and flashes of prune.  T: Lots of nutty and carob flavors. Dark rum. Big pull of spicy alcohol lets you know this beer means business and also helps to balance the deep sweetness. Dark caramel and brown sugar. Hints of fig and prune. Traces of earthy hops. Wood and woody vanilla rides up middle to end and brings a lot of welcome dryness. Trailing woody and carob finish.  M: Big, thick body. Very chewy and coating, yet velvety and sultry. Low tingling carbonation. Big alcohol warmth. Faded tannins.  O: Very impressive. Age suits this beer well. It's a gargantuan brew, but balanced perfectly.

10099,33832,stompilator,4.8,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a snifter.  A - Pours a deep, dark brown, thin cinnamon head.  S - Toasted almonds, peat smoke, figs, charred wood.  T - Extremely complex toasty nut and chocolate notes come out the gate. Roasty, nutty malts are quickly overcome by a huge charred wood flavor. Very rich vanilla bean notes and toasty, dry wood tannins interact with the robust malts beautifully. Tinges of chocolate malt weave in and out, but the Palo Santo wood is at the forefront. A light alcoholic burn develops over the mid-palate, climbing a bit in intensity with the chocolate malts towards the back. Finish is woody, sweet, a bit chocolatey, still bits of toasted almond, and decently boozy.  M - Absolutely nailed the mouthfeel. Full-bodied and sweet without being syrupy or cloying. Just enough carbonation to liven the flavor.  O - What a distinctive beer. Nothing tastes quite like it, and proudly eludes any style distinction.

Beer poured dark brown with a beautiful tan head that has some serious hang time.  Nose is roasted malts and hints of sweet wood.  Taste is heavy roast and wood with an initial alcohol warming. Molasses and vanilla round things out with a decent amount of hopping so that it is not cloying.  Mouthfeel is full and very smooth.  Overall a solid brew...looking forward to the 2008 version!  The 2008 version was a little more raisony and less hoppy which led to a slightly smoother beer but not enough of an appreciation so the ratings will not be changed.

Malts are faint and I get some fruit with it. Really complex. There are tons of subtle flavors and each sip seems to bring more in the nose and on the toung.

Now for the taste it is bold with flavor, and sweetness. There is a lot going on in Palo Santo Marron. At first, there is a bold sweetness and it fads to a clean roasted grains after taste.

10099,33832,MaximalC,4.17,"Pours seal brown right out of the bottle, with nothing more than a ring of khaki froth around the surface. If I had a nickel for every brown ale that had such a deep, dark brown color...I’d be broke. This looks straight up nice. Aroma smells of salted caramel and peat, with hints of cherry and booze. Spotty lacing clings to the glass as the beer recedes.  Alcohol wastes no time asserting itself on the front end, but once it subsides, your tastebuds are treated to flavors of smooth, rich molasses accented by butterscotch, brown sugar, and vanilla. It doesn’t take long before your lips are ensconced in a sticky, malty, residue that could nearly glue your mouth shut. Earthy, herbal hops provide a subtle, bitter counterpoint without getting in the way of the malt. While the alcohol felt a little strident at first, some habituation reveals that it’s not nearly as pronounced as you’d expect for its ABV. The delicious aftertaste is a lingering haze of molasses and brown sugar. A hefty body provides plenty of substrate for the luxurious taste, while very fine carbonation lends just the right amount of texture; the mouthfeel is befitting of the taste is accompanies.  After recently trying a series of light, caramel-colored brown ales, this was a revelation. Palo Santo Marron comes across more like an imperial doppelbock than a traditional brown ale. It wouldn’t be hyperbole to say this tastes very much like a barrel-aged Celebrator. It has definitely earned some of my respect for what I’d previously considered an overrated brewery.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Two finger light brown head  Smell: Sweet malt (caramel, toffee), vanilla, light chocolate, dark fruit such as black cherry and figs, wood  Taste: Upfront is that sweet malt (caramel, toffee) character that quickly transitions into vanilla and very light chocolate, perhaps a touch of dark fruits in there, and finishes with all the notes mentioned with a undertone of wood.  Mouthfeel: Heavy body; Goes down just fine considering the abv. with moderate alcohol presence and a dry, slightly bitter finish  Overall: Im admittedly not a big fan of Dogfish, but this one surprised the hell out of me. Every time i take a whiff and sip i pull out different aromas and flavors. Its pretty complex from the sweet malt characters to dark fruits, light chocolate, vanilla, and wood. I like how the finish carries on for a while and the woody character along with the dryness is almost like chewing on wood itself. Along with Indian Brown Ale, this is my favorite beer from DFH.

We are told that ther will be vanilla and caramel. And there is, certainly present in the nose. But also, a malty note in there as well. Hops are minimally present in the nose. Then the flavor delivers on two of the three promises. There is vanilla. There is caramel (both the candy profile and the malt profile... which was really tasty). There is a nice balance of the sweet with the necessary bitter. I am afraid I cannot detect specifics in the hops as the dominant sweet profiles mask them from my palate.  And then there is the wood. Just don't get it. Wood flavor that is. I understand the concept of practical uses for timber. I just cannot taste much in the way of wood. And I really want to. I want to taste the wood, like oak in a well made white wine (even though I don't like that flavor profile anymore). Or more importantly like wood from an American Bourbon. I know this isn't aged in Bourbon barrels, and I didn't expect that. Just wanted wood flavor period. Didn't get it, so I have no idea what a Palo Santo tree tastes like.

I've never had a 12% beer taste so smooth. Hints of toffee, caramel and chocolate all imparted by the Palo Santo wood. It's such a dark beer you forget it's a brown ale and not a stout. A ton of respect for DFH -- it cost them $140,000 to make the vessel made from Palo Santo Wood. Yet, this is the ONLY beer that's made in that vessel and it's nowhere close to being their top selling beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,michiganmatt,4.32,"Poured 12oz bottle with date of 7/21/14 into DFH Signature glass  Appearance - 4.5/5 Pitch black in color, with about a finger of brown head, which dissipates down to a thin layer. This is how I like to see a brown ale. Well, perhaps a dark opaque brown would be better, but I hate when a ""brown ale"" is a see-through reddish-brown, as is the case most of the time. So a very opaque appearance is a nice change from the typical brown ale.  Smell - 3.75/5 Deep, rich, roasty chocolate malts, sweet alcohol. Perhaps a little fruitiness.  Taste - 4.5/5 Wood flavor which is similar to oak, but a little different (the Palo Santo wood). I'd say the difference is that it's slightly less smoky and bitter, and a little more sweet. I like it better than oak flavor. Vanilla. Slightly fruity alcohol. The taste of this beer is great. It's hard to describe the complexity of the taste fully.  Mouthfeel - 4.5/5 Medium-full bodied. Extremely smooth and creamy. There is a light amount of carbonation. Perhaps a tad more would be nice, but I think it has close to the perfect amount.  Overall - 4.5/5 Overall, this was a great beer. Firstly, I was a big fan of the Palo Santo wood. It basically took oak taste, and removed some of the aspects of that taste which I didn't like, thus making an even better wood taste. I love the dark, opaque appearance, something that most brown ales lack. The feel of this beer in my mouth was incredible as well. So smooth and creamy, with just the right amount of carbonation (almost). Definitely recommended. I will definitely be picking up more of this in the future.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Leave a wispy cap and minimal oily lacing. Aroma is rich and roasty with chocolate notes, dark fruit, charred wood and sweet alcohol. Yum.  Taste is more of the same. Slightly bitter dark chocolate, toffee, a bit of caramel, prunes, vanilla, smoky wood notes, and a sweet warming alcohol finish. SO much going on, but it works in perfect harmony. Mouthfeel is full and viscous. Low carbonation. Coats the palate well, but drinks smoothly without feeling too heavy. Sip carefully, due to the abv, but I find this going down much easier than it should. Alcohol is certianly noticeable, but in a pleasant way that doesn't bother me in the least.  Brown ale....whatever. Drinks more like a stout to me, but they could call this American Brown Dishwater for all I care. Simply one of the best new (to me) beers I've tried in a long time.

10099,33832,IchLiebeBier,4.42,"Appearance: dark brown, mahogany body with medium beige, frothy head; good lacing  Smell: rich, sweet malts with roasted grains; you can detect the wood, which gives it a slight oaky-like smell  Taste: sweet malts with a big hit of roasted grains on the front; the notes of wood show up in the mid and lingers a bit with a bit of dryness; very little hop flavors, but the roasted grain and wood bitterness balance it out very well  Mouthfeel: thick and creamy  Remarks: this is a great beer; I'll definitely have it again, and again",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,StoneTSR,4.64,"APPEARANCE: This beer is a black hole. I always thought of it as more of brown in color than black, but nope. It’s black. Trying to shine my iPhone’s flashlight through it is impossible…even at an angle where there is less beer to travel through; the light just gets completely blocked. There is no red hue, no faint little red bulb on the other side of the glass, just blackness. A coffee-colored head foams up to about a finger, but collapses within ten seconds, leaving a paper-thin cap covering the whole surface of the glass minus a little ring just inside from the edge of the glass.  SMELL: A pleasant smell of wood leads the way with hints of everything else; vanilla, nuts, caramel and roasty coffee beans. There is a lot going on here and it’s really nice.  TASTE: There is even more going on in the taste than there was in the nose. Wow, there is a lot of flavor in here. The wood character is strong, but there is also an enormous vanilla character…and caramel as well. The wood, along with some pleasant roasted malt notes serve to even out the sweetness of the big vanilla and caramel. A touch of nuttiness is there as well. And maybe this is just because I am used to this from dark, Dogfish Head beers, but I am also getting some notes of figs and raisins.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium to big bodied, but mostly big. The balance here is nearly perfect. As mentioned in the Taste section, the wood and light roast do a great job of balancing all the other sweet flavors. The sparkle is a little more impressive than I expected, but this is also a silky, smooth beer that seems to just slide right down.  OVERALL: I can’t believe I haven’t reviewed this beer earlier because it has always been one of my favorites from DFH. It surprises and delights me every time I come across this treat. Being unique is great, but to be this different, yet still so well put together is exceptional. It is not every day that a year-round offering from any brewery deserves a 5 in any category, but Palo Santo most certainly does. It is greater than the sum of its parts.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,SerialTicker,4.25,"Had on-tap at Hop Cat in Detroit, Michigan. $12 for a snifter (10oz pour)... phew.  Most memorable beer of the night, I'd say... man I was impressed with this beer. So unique and memory sticking, it's as if I just finished it. The table didn't seem especially impressed, but I really was... it's bizarre. On my nose, it smells like wet wood chips after a good rain and almost nothing else... really, I relate it to the dry-down that quite a few men's musky colognes have. For the taste? Well, wow. It's a lot of wood flavor, but also an unexpectedly large amount of red and black licorice with a fair smack of heat from the alcohol. The woodiness is there from beginning to end and is readily apparent, but I don't think it ever becomes overwhelming. It is still no doubt the focal point.  This was a stunning beer and a glaring reminder to me as to why I enjoy craft beer. Not only was it super unique, it was very well crafted... what else should I expect from Dogfish Head? I'll be snagging a bottle of this next time I see it so I can try it again -- it is definitely something one-of-a-kind and special.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,lyonbg,4.03,"As with many brews from Dogfish Head this is a very unique beer with a unique after tasted that is highly impacted, almost dominated, by the high alcohol content (12%). It has an array of flavors and the after taste comes across as almost tart, certainly more than most brown ales. From the look of the beer as you pour it you expect a very full mouth feel as the beer appears very dark and thick, but surprisingly it has a rather light to moderate mouth feel.

10099,33832,dmgeng,4.85,"Wanted to start trying some of the bigger DFH offerings and this 12% beer caught my eye.  A - Deep dark brown almost black in the glass with some murkiness. Dark khaki head and nice lacing.  S - Tons of of sweet brown smell with caramel, toffee, vanilla, nut and some soft woody like smells mingling in your nose. Sweet but so much deep and maybe a little alcohol. It was complex and amazing all in one snifter.  T - The flavors culminate on your palate with malt, vanilla, caramel, light chocolate, and light coffee. The alcohol is very smooth and is only noticeable in the warming notes that you feel after the swallow. It is definitely on the sweeter side but with the depth there is something that doesn't really detract. Tastes like an amazing Brown but with so much complexity and richness that it contends for one of the best beers I've had.  M - Very high mouth-feel with moderate carbonation. It pours quite thick and is sweet on the palate but the smooth alcohol and helpful carbonation make it not too cloying  Overall, this is a tremendously delicious beer. If KBS or Bourbon County aren't available this beer maybe able to help sooth the big beer blues. There is a ton of flavor that tends to evolve on your tongue. There is no debating that this beer is on the sweeter side of beers but with so much to offer it is hard to not love it. Though there are a few (KBS) that are better than this brew I would think that this would be my new go to when I'm feeling low and Ten Fidy isn't in stock.

I can't tell Palo Santo wood from oak, but it carries a similar aromatic profile - with the vanilla, but without the char. Red wine grapes complement the dark fruit, as do brown sugar and caramel.  The woody quality of the aroma reminds me quite a bit of Burton Baton, actually.  Incredibly full-flavored, complex, and sweet. Chocolate and fruit up front; roasted barley and caramel in the middle; and a marshmallowy vanilla, with a woody earthiness and spices on the back end.  Very thick brew; sticky and cloying.

I'm not a huge fan of the IPA's and DIPA's that everyone seems to be raving about lately even though I have had them.  Enjoy this beer at 60 - 65 degrees for the best flavor.

I don't have a snifter, but that is what this should be poured into.  I love the booze smell coming from this beer but the alcohol itself is well hidden. I savor the smell of this beer before every sip and it usually take me hour to drink one.

(But what do you expect of from a 12% ABV beer?) 3/3  Aroma: A complex aroma indeed! Presents a dastardly boozy mixture of dried dark fruit, butterscotch, and chocolate. Lightly roasted malt holds it all together, giving off a slightly smoky, even meaty secondary scent. 11/12  Taste: Sugary dates, prunes, and dried cherries come close to being cloying before bitter, rauchbier-like flavors smoke out the sweet and bring in the savory. Lightly roasted malt, rich dark coffee, tobacco, and even a bit of bacon create a surprisingly balanced and finish to the indulgent dessert of a beginning. Spicy hops make for a tangy garnish. Absolutely delicious. 18/20  Mouthfeel: Chewy yet silky, with medium carbonation to create a dry finish appropriate for the smokier flavors. Alcohol warming is just noticeable enough to confirm that yes, this beer is big. 5/5  Overall: Couldn't wait to try this one, and my high expectations were blown out of the trub. Gives the best of any big beer a of any type a run for its money without succumbing to that ""you either love it or hate it"" description most beers of this size and complexity call forth.

Mouthfeel is dominated by a tingly, prickly feeling across the tongue, almost like crushed peppercorns. Medium body, not a stout, with good carbonation. Overall a tremendous and unique beer. I think mine is fresh, and it expect age will bring out softer vanilla flavors and tame the spicy/peppery flavors and hide the alcohol better.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Sweet espresso and toffee.  T – Juicy, sweet chocolate and mild coffee. Spicy from the wood. A lot of bitterness up front, then the sweet vanilla and molasses take over. Maybe some raisin notes and toffee. Flavors open even more as it warms, more toffee and caramel notes.  M – Spicy, tingling, dancing on the tongue. Again, not as thick as it looks, mild to medium carbonation. Minor sweetness lingers on the back of the tongue. More of the bitterness on sides of my tongue long after the swallow.  O – Tried this beer a few months ago and it had some balance issues. Held on to this bottle for about five months and it has paid off handsomely.

The nose is Brown Ale yet maybe a little different. Light chocolate malt, brownie batter, fudge but some dark fruit, maple, vanilla and sorghum. As it warmed I got some smoky wood and a bit of booze.  Very complex flavors of chocolate malt, caramel, toffee, Graham cracker, prune, wood, smoke, molasses and char.

Smells like vanilla and mixed nuts. Slight booze notes. Maybe some spice.  Taste is booze forward at first, but mellows into a vanilla and spice flavor. Slight interesting flavor from the wood. The wood definitely gives it a mellowness on the finish. Good finish.  Feels fairly carbonated. Smooth after the booze subsides, but also slightly creamy.  Overall a good beer.

S: Smells fairly boozy. Lot of deep toffee and molasses like malty notes. Almost Bourbon-y. Some cedar or redwood notes. A touch of bittersweet chocolate. I quite enjoy the nose, actually! The smell is so strong I can taste it slightly on my tongue if I take a deep whiff.  T/MF: The flavors follow along very closely to the smell. Very deep burnt toffee, with undertones of bittersweet chocolate, and just a touch of char. Very slight licorice. Deep, sap note. The flavors seem to waft around just over the tongue. I like all of this better on the nose, but it tastes pretty great, too. It does taste slightly boozy, so that wasn't masked as well as it could be, but that's a minor complaint.

Taste is of dark-roasted, very sweet, syrupy barley malt, a background wood note, subdued hop bitterness, and even molasses, I think.

Hint of ash/smoke. Finishes with a lingering woodiness, that keeps this from becoming an overly sweet prune/toffee bomb. ABV has a noticeable bite from sip to swallow. Very complex.  M - Medium bodied, with medium-to-low carbonation. Medium body works well with the flavor profile, as anything more would probably push this into syrup territory.  O - Complex and rich.

Smell a bit roasty and coffee that opened up as it warmed to more of a bourbon-y essence.  Taste was very roasty with a bitter finish. As the beer warmed, more complexity revealed itself and became coffee, char, bitter chocolate and wood.  Mouthfeel was medium to full with a good bit of carbonation.

Dark as a moonless midnight and sweet as can be without having dimples. The crafting & sophistication are there, as always, from Milton, MD.

Smells roasty, with exotic spice and flowers, cedar, a slight suggestion of root beer, and mild booze. A bit muted, but very nice.  Rich and flavorful. Sweet and roasty, very well balanced, with creamy vanilla, roasted coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit. Warm spice in the throat. A bit of wood emerges. Long finish, roasty and spicy with a little wood and booze. Very tasty.  Full rich sumptuous texture, great. Quite drinkable for what it is.  Great beer.  June 11, 2014 - same bottling as above, but cellared at 55 degrees F for about 5 years and 10 months:  Dark reddish-brown, almost black. Golden-red meniscus. Basically no head.  Exotic scent, seems similar to my notes from 2008, but with less overt roastiness. Dark fruit, flowers, cedar, spice, coconut, vanilla, root beer. Quite aromatic and characterful. Has a nice freshness; seems to have held up well in the cellar.  Tastes like dark fruit (dried Mission fig), chocolate, smooth booze, vanilla, coconut, and pronounced cedar - or, presumably, palo santo - which gains intensity toward the finish. Good length. Tasty. No overt oxidized character.  Super smooth and drinkable.

No head at all, but after four years, I would expect that.  S: Sweet, like glazed ham coming out of the over. Got me excited.  T: Like a fine port, heavy on the fig. Sweet, but not overpowering. Most of the coffee and chocolate dissipated due to age, but the strong fig tasted great.  M: Best sipped like scotch or an expensive brandy.  O: I completely enjoyed this.

Vanilla flavors, again along with some sweet fruits. And I still get that hint of cinnamon at the end.  Feel: Full bodied, and a creamy texture. Carbonation is mild.

This brew definitely has some dark purple, and/or ruby colors lurking around in there. The head dies down into a light cover over the top and spreads out to ring the sides of the glass. The lacing is slippery and easily slides down the sides of the glass. This beer is definitely appealing to look at.  There is a faint boozy and roasted malt smell. There is also an aroma of earth and sweetness.  This beer almost has a bourbon type of taste, but doesn't go all the way through with it. The bourbon end is missing, no booziness. The taste is familiar but exotic. Similar to a stout, but of course different.  The mouthfeel of this brown ale is chewy, plus smooth and silky, with mild, dense carbonation.

The nose isn't as roasted in nature as I expected from the color. Perhaps the wood mellows it a tad, and it comes through with a bit as a wine-cherry-ish tartness. There are also some dark sugar notes in as well.  The initial tastes are on the sweet side, the dark sugar from the nose. The beer has a bit of quad-like sweetness (without the Belgian yeast notes), date, plum, fig. The feel is silky smooth, and the wood that subtly comes through adds a light drying feel in the end. As the beer warms, the alcohol does add a little burn to the end.  I've had this numerous times before, and each time it seems to grow on me more.

A bittersweet chocolate and espresso. Then onto again those sweet raisins, fig, and dried plum notes. A caramel and toffee sweetness and hint of nuttiness. Then onto a big slap of alcohol and then the beer lingers off of chocolate bitterness roasted malt and heavy wood note. Lots of tobacco character and drying instead of sweetness.  This beer probably does wonders with age as the alcohol is very prevalent. It is an interesting combination of stout, old ale, brown ale, quad, and barrel.

10099,33832,HoppySeb,4.4,"Appearance: Pours jet black with a creamy cappuccino colored one inch head. Poured on a teku glass, put against the light and couldn't pick up anything through the thick pour. Not much lacing after the head dissipates. Residual alcohol legs remain after every sip.  Smell: Vanilla and the alcohol is predominant, wrapped on the sweet aromas from the barrel aging - wood (palo santo, I guess :) ). I also pick up spices (trace amounts of cinnamon) and coffee, this last one mostly coming out after the beer warmed up a little after being in a fridge at 55 degrees.  Taste: Faint coffee comes out increasingly sip after sip, but never overpowering like some RIS. Vanilla and wine/spirit type alcohol are always present. This makes a very well balanced beer. The after taste is lasting and opens up with the sip's subsequent breath exposing more of the properties of this complex beer - vanilla ice cream, pinot noir, and cinnamon.  Mouthfeel: Creamy. Delicious. Almost no carbonation allowing for the tongue and palate to easily absorb the full spectrum of flavors, without distraction.  Overall: Excellent beer. At this price point ($14/4pk in WA) its a very compelling offering from DFH that can compete with both strong ales, brown ales as well as lower ABV RIS.

10099,33832,Crafts_and_recreation,4.82,"A: Pours a very dark, nearly black color with two fingers of dense, tan foam that retains beautifully and nearly cloaks the insides of the glass with a thick, tight lacing. Tiny bubbles continue to rise and build in layers below the surface. Looks nearly like a freshly brewed espresso with foam atop.  S: Strong, aromatic wood, dark malts, and raisin lead the nose with a hint of chocolate to follow. Aroma continues to build with more woody/earthy notes and some alcohol as it warms.  T: Smoke, wood, and roasted malts rush in, followed by a hint of sweet, dark fruit, and perhaps a bit of raisin and vanilla. Beautifully hidden alcohol, with very little noticeable heat. Roasted malts linger on the palate, with ever so slight bitterness at the finish.  M: Extremely creamy head with excellent carbonation, almost chewy full and silky mouthfeel, and incredibly smooth (actually, it's terrifyingly smooth for its ABV). Not nearly as thick as it looks, following the Brown Ale profile even though it looks more like a Stout. Finishes with a perfect touch of dryness.  O: Exceptional! This brew left me craving the next sip! It was almost as enjoyable to look at as it was to drink. If anything, I wish they had bolstered the aroma a bit, as it seems the rest of its attributes tend to overshadow the aromatic profile.

S- Lots of rich wood character, caramelized sugars, and touch of vanilla  T- Sweet malt up front mellows into the dark fruit and damp wood. Significant booze flavor in the finish.  M- I genuinely enjoyed the feel as it was full and somewhat silky, but the booze was slightly hot and distracting.  O- Very solid imperial brown here. I haven't had many beers of the style to compare it to, but the one that comes to mind is Prairie Okie. A bit more contained and less complex to that one in comparison.

M - Coats the tongue, but the body is not particularly heavy, but there is significant alcohol burn.  O - Not your standard brown. This is a beer that comes in big, with huge sweetness, alien wood elements, and underlying booze notes.

Beautiful combination of coffee, chocolate, and caramel comes next, morphing into wonderful dark roast coffee. Spice, dark chocolate, and coffee aftertaste.

All in all this one was like other dogfish brews not very good.wtf is up with these guys do they think their shit is like nectar of the gods or what,I mean all there beer is way overpriced and not that great.i have yet to have a world class beer from them yet.i won't be buying this again and maybe not any dogfish head period.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Aroma: alcohol, cherries (dried), vanilla, coffee, smokey hardwood- almost like a beach cookout smelled from waaayyy down the beach.  Flavor: light smoke, alcohol, coffee, roasted malts. Slight hoppy-ness, vanilla, toffee?, hint of chocolate, dark dried fruits. Sweetness at first then bittering, then super complex, followed by alcohol warming.

A dark brown... Damn near stout territory. A nice tan head, about a fingers worth. Nice retention and some lacing too.  S) Sweet and malty... A bit of roast with a fair amount of dark fruit. Milky, like a hint of milk chocolate, and smokey, with vanilla, and a little spice.  T) Very flavorful... Unlike any brown ale I've had the opportunity to try. It's near the nose. Sweet, smokey, a fair amount of wood. The alcohol is so well hidden.  M) Full bodied with mild carbonation. This is fairly thick... Goes down smooth. Nice aftertaste too.

Each sip caused me to lean back in my chair and smack my lips and enjoy the fruity aftertaste. There isn't a hint of bitterness anywhere in the tasting and there is such a pleasant fruit smell and clean, smooth taste that I don't feel the need to chase it with chips, but it sure does go well with Pringles.  I probably poured it wrong, but I barely got any head... just 1/8"" but it surely didn't dampen the taste.  I'll re-review it if I get a different pour another time.

10099,33832,dpgoblejr,4.94,"To begin, for me alone, this was a true spectacle of perfection. The beer poured a very dark-brown color almost pitch-black, opaque; into a Smuttynose snifter glass.  No light getting through this dark, thick beer. One finger thick light-brown/ mocha colored head formed then dissipated with streaks of lacing along the edges of the glass.  The body of this brew is almost like that of a stout. Smells of some chocolate, molasses, some sweet dark fruits, roasted malts, nuts, possibly caramel, and of course of vanilla.  Truly divine flavor and taste of coffee, chocolate, caramel, molasses, toffee, wood, dried fruits and vanilla.  Slick, smooth, mouth feel may be quite possibly amazing amongst the subtle carbonation. Warming heat on the back end of the palate when finishing from the 12% ABV that is mostly hidden until the glass is empty.  Overall, this was an awesome concoction that I cannot wait to savor again! Stored a couple away for next time. Highly recommended!!!  6/21/2014 Edit: Just cracked opened this beer again with a brewed on date of 6/19/13. One year later and it's still a wonderful looking dark brew with a nice foamy head. Smells as wonderful as I remember with the vanilla seeming to be more pronounced. The flavor is still so unique with an emphasis on the molasses and the aged wood tones. Very smooth and oh so fantastic. If you can age one, do it!  4/24/15 Savoring a bottle from 12/25/14 and it is probably what I would call my go to everyday beer; if I could drink it everyday.

Comments to come in the Overall section of the review.  App- Dark brown body, one finger mocha head with good retention. Not much lacing. Looks thick and viscous.  Smell- Overpowering alcohol, but still get sweet caramel, toffee, very nutty, lots of oak. Alcohol is very strong here and in my opinion, a big detractor.  Flavour- Very, very sweet. Caramel, nuttiness, lots of oak. And a lot of alcohol. Not very complex, and I find this to be borderline undrinkable due to the sweetness and the solvent-nature of the alcohol.  Mouthfeel- Thick bodied, syrupy, viscous. Pretty much on point for what I'd expect from an Imperial Brown Ale.  Overall- I did not like this beer that much. It's drinkable, but not by much. The sweetness and the high solvent alcohol character on this beer is too overwhelming for me. The 9/2012 bottle was even more disgusting as it was just even more overwhelmingly sweet without any alcohol presence to cut the sweetness. The price point is also not helping this beer any.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

The smell of the wood and the alcohol are easy to find and then come forward at the first sip. In the middle and end you get all the little nuances. The earthy tones, mostly nuttiness, from the brown ale compliments the overwhelming wood flavor. It's a filling beer that coats your mouth from the first sip.

10099,33832,BrewViking,4.56,"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron is nearly black, with a dense, dark-brown head, with substantial lacing. It has a mild malty smell that belies its overwhelmingly chocolatey (in a good way - deep, tasty dark chocolate not cloyingly sweet or artificial) flavor. The intense flavour nearly covers the substantial 12% abv despite minimal hoppiness, but it's still easy to tell that this isn't a beer to slam, or even an every-day sipping beer. There is no pretending that this is something light. The density is slightly offset by a pleasant carbonation.  Calls itself a brown ale but it's far heavier than anything else I've had in the genre, probably closer to an imperial stout.

The flavors and rich smoothness of the body mask it in an enticing manner. Complex to say the least.  O - Really good and hits the spot for the complex stout and aged stout area even though this is a ""brown ale"".

There's alot going on there, it's earthy and fruity, smells sweet like molasses. Some spice in there too like cinnamon or clove, maybe some anise and chocolate.  The taste is much like the nose, very complex, you get some of that molasses sweetness off the bat followed by a touch of bitterness and spice. I get almost none of the 12% abv, it's very well masked, just a slight warming sensation as it goes down. Would not have guessed blind that this beer was as strong as it is.

Big barrel presence with hints of wood, vanilla, and oak. Roasted malts with hints of sweet caramel, toffee, chocolate, biscuit, coffee, grains, smoke, and yeast. Big presence of dark fruit with hints of raisin, fig, prune, cherry, and plum. Sweet scent of brown sugar and syrup. Also some anise and cinnamon like spice. Hops are very light. A very good aroma.  Taste: Like it smells, a rich, sweet, and woody malt driven taste with big notes of dark fruit and caramel. Woody taste from the barrel along with some notes of vanilla and oak. Roasted malts with notes of sweet caramel, biscuit, grains, coffee, toffee, toasted bread, yeast, and slight smoke. Big taste of dark fruits with notes of fig, raisin, cherry, prune, and plum. Spice notes of anise and slight cinnamon. Sweet taste of brown sugar and some syrupy molasses. Not much hop presence. A really interesting and good taste.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Rich, chewy, creamy, and somewhat syrupy. Alcohol heat is pretty smooth considering the 12% ABV.

A slight wood nose which balances the malt aroma. Slight hop bitterness lingers on the nose.  T - Exactly like the smell, you get a lot of dark fruits. Not as much as a Quad, but a good presence. The taste is balanced well with a smooth dryness coming from what I assume is the ""holy wood"" in which it is fermented in.  M - Nice and creamy with a bit of carbonation at the tip of the tongue. The taste lingers nicely and changes in complexity as it sits on the tongue.  O - All I can say is WOW! This beer is a must try. DFH really nailed it here with Palo Santo Marron.

S - Aroma is very nice with sweet malt, wood, caramel, toffee, vanilla and syrup.  T - This beer really tastes great, but not like a brown ale would. Heavy malts and syrup with caramel, vanilla and wood mixed in. I don't notice much bitterness, but it isn't overly sweet. The booze is very well hidden.  M - Low carbonation as expected from the aging. Thick and chewy mouth feel from this unlike most brow ales which are much more thin.  O - Great beer than I really enjoyed.

I get a little of that style, but it is it's own beast. Honestly it tastes similar in many ways to a Barleywine, but kind of comes across as a strong, dark Belgian and stout too. Very unique. Has a booziness to it, but it is 12%. Smell is awesome. I get molasses, fruit/fig, brandy/wine, some other shit I can't even begin to describe so I'll go with ""complex mo fo"". Taste follows all that jive. Some chocolate and nutty flavor for sure a touch of coffee, and a cherry wood like note. Don't even know what the hell kind of wood Palo Santo is but I may have to build a bourbon cabinet out of it. A very unique and fantastic beer.

Looks rich and oily deep brown/ virtually black. Low head, nice lacing. Has a rummy sweet smell, raisin abounds. Other dark fruit seems to lurk, even cinnamon. Barely a hint of the 12% alc. otherwise. Mysterious. Tastes like an oaky burn, with a creamy mouthfeel and a cognac after-effect. The dark fruit is in the upfront taste. A big type of brown ale, a fine after-dinner drink to sip. Not my favorite DFH beer, as ""oak-age"" isn't my favorite beer attribute. But this is still unique as far as the taste and style.

Slightly fruity with some raisins and figs thrown in. Alcohol and fusels join the party as well.  Wow. Sweet and alcoholic. Some smoke and hoppiness but the alcohol is a bit overwhelming. A sweet, alcoholic mess. Creamy on the tongue saves this beer a little bit.  I was impressed with the first two categories but the rest was downhill.

10099,33832,BeerSlut87,4.46,I actually bought this beer not really reading the label thinking it was the 90min IPA. I have to say I am so glad that I made this mistake. This beer hit you right in the mouth as soon as you open it. It has a hint of vanilla and almost a coffee stout aroma. The first sip is almost like a porter with a blast of hops. Its mild carbonation makes it very drinkable for a 12% beer. It has a unique aftertaste that is hard to describe other than that of a oatmeal porter with a hop mix. Overall a great beer that needs to be tried.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

No surprise there, given the 12% ABV. Rich, deep and complex, and I would almost swear that it was smoked.  T: Wow. This beer sure packs a wallop of flavor. chocolate malts, black coffee and caramel give way to a rich, smoked wood flavor. The flavor the the alcohol suffuses the entire tasting experience, from beginning to end.  M; Lighter than the looks might indicate, with a decent amount of carbonation to lighten it further.

Perhaps not 12% heavy, but a slow sipper for sure.  O: A very interesting and impressive beer. The wood comes through, but the base beer seems very well crafted and unique.

Roasted malt astringency balances out some prodigious malty sweetness. A little bit of herbal hoppiness on the finish. Smooth, woody notes of vanilla. There's no doubt that this has been woo-aged. Only a relatively small amount of booziness on the finish, less than you'd expect in a 12% beer. Very smooth in texture with a soft carbonation, a great match for the flavors at play.

Nose is dark fruit, super-malt, and boozy. The bottle indicates there should be some vanilla and caramel notes. I get the caramel, not picking up on the vanilla, but definitely some dank wood. Flavor is like liquefied raisin, and boy is this thick. So good, and the vanilla really comes through in the flavor (maybe as it's warming), as does the wood, giving it real winelike character. The mouthfeel as I said is thick, alcohol level is up there with a wine and gives a similarly tongue-numbing sensation, and low carbonation. Overall, completely badass.

A - Incredible deep dark brown to black color: almost looks like oil coming out of the bottle and I mean that in the best way possible. A rich, full head takes its time to settle, pleasantly thick at first.  S - The smell is deceptive - it only hints at its dark complexity, but the smell is attractive and a good invitation to the taste.  T - The taste is complex: it starts out with a front of dark caramel sweetness that dissolves against a faintly more bitter front into the aftertaste. There are notes of vanilla in there, but they are subtle.  M - When tasting, the first thing I noticed was its mouthfeel - velvety smooth. Perhaps the nature of the Palo Santo wood lends some of its natural oil to the feel. I'm not sure, but it's amazing.

A finger and a half of tan head forms and dissipates. An oil-on-water pattern of tiny bubbles swirls up the black surface.  I'm not getting much aroma. Very quiet. Coffee, sweet vanilla, molasses, wood. A bit of brown-ale tartness, or is that citrus hops? Ah, coming on now with the warming you get raisin and brown sugar, plus a charred umami. Still, though, this aroma is awfully tame.  Weird that it's clearly a malt bomb, but the red wine flavor is pretty confusing. Bitter-sweet burnt coffee and dark chocolate make me think initially I'm sipping an imperial stout. But then dark fruit tanginess escorts more bitterness (hops?) to the back of the mouth. Creamy mouthfeel smooths the way for a metal barrel and alcohol-fume prickle on the back of the tongue. I'm surprised not to get the wood until well into my fourth sip, but there it is.  The low-ish carbonation and slick oily viscosity make this a real sipper, especially as the abv is plainly apparent. Smooth, though. It's going down faster than expected.

From there woody, earthy hop bitterness followed by welches grape juice, fig, and dates round out the beer.

Don't really get any of the alcohol that dominates when younger.  Head is a light khaki color and about 2 fingers (though may have poured too aggressive expecting a minimal head with it being a 12% abv).  First sip is glorious.

It strikes a perfect balance of sweetness and and roasty bitterness. No alcohol burn can be detected as this beer has turned almost into a fine liquor with age.

Perhaps the age of the brew that's doing this? No matter, not a big deal to me. Lacing is prevalent. The brew itself is a dark void of a liquid that says ""no"" to light.  Smell: A few things are going on. I'm getting ""camp fire smoke"" which is pretty awesome, as it reminds me of all those wonderful campfires throughout my life. A bit of vanilla, and maybe caramel?  Taste: That camp fire smell is still there! It taste like burnt wood, if burnt wood tasted good. (Makes sense to me!) Getting a lot of the vanilla and the malts. Bitterness is low, with quite a bit of sweetness taking over.  Feel: Although it pours like black syrup, it's very light in the mouth. Carbonation is medium, and it's amazing how well the alcohol is hidden. I feel warmth as it goes down, but nothing at all in my mouth. Interesting.  Overall: I pulled the last two of the shelf, checked the dates out of curiosity and said ""why not?"" Glad I did. I'll have to try it fresh some day to see if it's the same, but almost a year later, this beer held up quite nicely and offered a fairly unique experience when it comes to brown ales.

Caramel tinge at the edge.  Smell at first is indistinguishable from an imperial stout or at least a boozy regular stout. Very roasty.  As time passes, get more of those distinctive brown ale notes. Lots of fruitcake with requisite brandy, spices and glacé fruit. Very Christmas cake-esque.  Taste also reflects the Christmas-cake theme. Fortified character, Christmas-cake, roast. Perhaps a spirituous suggestion, more neutral like Brandy than a more characterful spirit.  The wood largely seems to contribute an astringency to the palate, although I wouldn't be surprised if it was responsible for the meta Brandy-flavour, and by extension the Christmas-cake quality.

Head quickly recedes leaving bubbles along the rim of the glass with some alcohol legs.  Lots of woody vanilla immediately, burnt marshmallow, toasted maltiness, somewhat earthy and leathery with a touch of booze in the nostrils.  Taste offers a similar abundance of vanilla and toasted sweet flavors. Flavors are remarkably smooth at this ABV and although I haven't had this beer fresh, I'll credit the age for some characteristics. Quick hit of bitterness comes in and fades into a slightly alcoholic aftertaste. Hops are restrained but provide just enough resiny presence in this malt bomb.  Nice and chewy and smooth. Very enjoyable.  Been wanting to try this and glad I finally did. Certainly a Brown to be reckoned with.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,WheelsPSU,3.97,"I had this beer fresh from the source at the DFH brewery with AleBorland83. We first saw the wood tanks made of imported Paraguayan wood, and then sampled the beer in DFH’s tasting room.  It poured a jet black, completely opaque. At 12% ABV, I smelt the alcohol right away followed by a burst of maple syrup. The alcohol was not overpowering, rather was there to let you know this beer is to be respected.  However upon the first sip, all I tasted was alcohol. Once used to that, I found notes of caramel and vanilla presumably from the wood tanks. Maybe even raisins somewhere in there. Roasted malts finish the flavor profile. The beer really lingered in my mouth letting me taste the earthy complexity the beer offers.  This is a big brew that DFH tackled rather uniquely. An imperial brown for beer lovers that like high gravity. Well done.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,gabrielsyme,4.43,"I've been drinking this beer for 4 years off and on, and while I won't call it a favorite, it's always been enjoyable.  It's worth pointing out that in all respects this beer is not a typical brown ale. At 12% and with lots of intense flavor, you won't be knocking pints back all night.  Appearance is dark, dark brown with medium lacing. Aroma is of alcohol and maybe caramelized plums. Taste is of bitter, dark chocolate and figs. The mouthfeel is not what I would call smooth but it does not detract.  I plan on aging a bottle of this year's batch.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Instead of simply grinning and bearing it, I decided to sit on it and let it age a spell. Tonight, after nearly a year, I opened my second bottle, dated 9/19/12, and decanted into—appropriately—a Dogfish Head Signature Glass.  A: Inky, opaque, brown with almost no head and no lacing to speak of. This is a brown ale of brown ales.  S: Woodsy and sweet. Reminds me very much of oak but with a wonderful sweet cherry addition.  T: Vanilla and raisins at the forefront with the notes of the palo santo wood coming through more pronounced as the beer warms. The alcohol is much more hidden now that the beer has aged a good while.  M: Syrupy and warm with a nice and heavy mouthfeel.  O: Do yourself a favor, pick up a four-pack, and let it sit for a year.

Bitter chocolate, anise, bacon fat and soy glaze dominate this beer. The wood is extremely prevalent, and the flavors are almost too intense.

Collins and couldn't resist because I'm a lover of brown beers.  Poured into an Anchor pint glass, this looks like a big ole stout - black with a brown ring of fine bubbles leaving little lace behind.  Aromas of brown sugar, birch syrup, plums, raisins, all simmering in rum sauce.  Flavors of coffee bean, rum raisin, dark chocolate, and a vanilla finish. Heavy on the booze.  Feel is slightly syrup-like but very dry due to 12% abv. Carbonation is a bit understated for my taste.  Very good overall. Could have been a big hit, but the alcohol is simply too hot.

Here it goes. It pours nice, jet black motor oil color with a creamy caramel head thin, but stays. Taste is upfront malty, notes of vanilla, wood, and maybe chocolate? Little aftertaste. One major positive is the alcohol is masked really well, I mean I can barely taste it and most beers over 10% its pretty pronounced. Here is the issue. The beer really does need more carbonation to be a home run. I found it a tad on the flat side. Still overall though a good beer. They really could have a gem though with a few tweaks.

Vanilla, booze, oak, caramel, dark berries, chocolate, and roast malt form the initial aroma. Very complex. Toasted, nutty notes add support for the high booze content. Tar emerges as it warms.  Flavor is initially fruit forward, with vinous notes colliding with perfume and floral notes, finishing fairly dry, oaky, and a touch bitter. Dark cherry character tends to dominate, supported by chocolate, vanilla, and roast malt. Plums, prunes, and figs add complexity. Nutty, toasted malt provides a solid foundation.  Body is thick and viscous, smooth, and syrupy, with a surprisingly moderate amount of carbonation, and significant alcohol warmth.  Interesting brew.

S - More subdued than I was expecting at 12% ABV. Probably has mellowed a bit after 10 months on the shelf. Faint smell of vanilla and wood.  T - Again, more subdued than I thought, but very tasty. A warming taste of dark fruits, peat, and most of the alcohol on the back end. Makes me forget this is ""just"" a brown ale.  M - Good balance of carbonation and creaminess, coming from a fan of thick imperial stouts.  O - Took a chance after spotting this in the back of the shelf, but figured this type of brew might be well served by sitting and mellowing for a while.

I cant say what this beer tastes like fresh, but I imagine its a bit hot. This, which a year and a half of age on in, is really, really good. There really isnt much to compare it so style-wise, but this drinks more like an imperial stout than a brown ale.

10099,33832,Groomsy,4.49,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled on 12/19/12.  Looking more like a stout, Palo Santo Marron pours a very dark brown, nearly black, with no light shining through except for some blood red highlights on the age. It's topped by a khaki head that dwindles to light bubbles on the edge. Tons of alcohol legs on the glass. This is majestic.  The nose is complex and deep: Immediately, I pick up molasses and caramel, and beneath that, roasted grain, coffee, and chocolate. Lying underneath all of this is a thick, woody, oaky smell and a slight earthy aroma like pipe tobacco. There is also a hint of sweet booze. Incredible.  PSM is incredibly layered and hard to pin down, and I say that in the best way possible. Starting with a massive, dripping sweetness of caramel, nuts, chocolate, coffee, and roasted grain, the sweetness slowly melds into the earthy flavors of the wood aging that carries into the finish where more earthy sweetness finishes strong with no noticeable alcohol flavor but a rather strong burn. What a beauty of a drink.  Predictably, the mouthfeel is heavy with low carbonation, but not flat or lifeless. Heavy alcohol burn on the finish so you know who's boss. Lingering flavors of oak, earth, and espresso.  Dang. That's all I know to say.

10099,33832,Saisonistic,4.75,"I was so excited to move to my new location to find a place that had 4 different variations of Dogfish Head beer. In my book, this is one of the most coveted brewery's in the United States. This beer is no exception, the hype is spot on.  A - Dark brown/blackish - a stout type feel for a brown, but then again it is unfiltered. About 2mm of tan head lacing.  S - Wood and oak, coffee notes, hazelnut, slightly grassy. Yet, it is not picking out the specifics in the nose of this beer, it is how robust each note sits on it's own. It's like you can smell the superb balance even without tasting it.  T & M - Like I said above, balance. Its rich and a bit frothy. Slightly heavier than most browns, but not quite a stout. It has a bitterness that is quickly absorbed with the sweeter notes in the beer. Chocolate and coffee with a roasted malt character to die for. It is made so well that you cannot tell that there is 12% alcohol in it at all.  O - If you can find this beer, buy it.

The heavy head lingered long for me, despite the short disappointments noted in other reviews. Smells of vanilla, cinammon, dark berries, and mocha. In addition to coffee tastes, there is early pepper and other spice...a bit too heavy plant-heat in the middle and end, though. And the booze puts things out of balance, especially as it warms. The aftertaste, for me, is of higher alcohols and not very enjoyable. Warm in the mouth, but thinner than expected. A fair balance of cream and buzz, but not remarkable. Overall, the appearance of this creature is the best part. It's out of balance from that point forward, even though there are some interesting elements.

The head comes up upon a tilt of the glass and leaves beautiful legs and quickly disappearing faint lace. Pretty. Nose is roasted coffee, and bitter chocolate with a coldness right out of the fridge. A little grass on top. The roasted coffee is strong and deep. Then a woody aroma that is pure wood. Smells soft and bends around the nose, very supple. Roasted malt, caramel but brown sugar. Not sugary, sugar. So authentic. There's some nutty accents and a tiny bit of vanilla that smells very fresh. A bit of alcohol on the nose and a light grass. The nose continues to deepen and evolve. The coffee and the chocolate marry one another and become entwined in sweet harmony. The one is never without the other in the drink. The chocolate sweetens and the malt deepens. A bit of cherry develops and it compliments the wood and earthiness. The taste is unexpected. Your first taste after smelling the coldness right from the fridge is a warming sweet brown bread. There's sugar, and sweet creamy chocolate. The roasted coffee glides over the palate as easily as your morning cup. The vanilla excites the richness of both the coffee and the chocolate and the malt is smooth and mellow. The wood notes translate into the drink and lend to the overall freshness. The hops stay grass like. The tiny bit of alcohol is simply warming in the drink and pokes it's head out only on the finish where you meet those cherry notes one more time. Finishes dry.  This a beer that continues to develop in the glass and in the drink. It's smooth and yet it enlivens the palate and the senses. It grows on you and you like it more and more as you drink.

I'll have to try it fresh someday.  Appearance - An aggressive pour yields a finger of rich, bubbly brown head atop a body of almost-black brown. When you hold it up to light, you can see highlights of iced coffee. Dissipates after just a little while, with moderate lacing that eventually fades away to just a thin rim of foam around the edge of the glass.  Smell - Complex and full of depth. Initially nutty characteristics, but that gives way to elements of brownie/chocolate and hints of dank soil and leather.  Taste - Bittersweet, with veins of vanilla and some alcoholic heat. Some cedar, only milder and sweeter. Finish is caramel and earthy hops make an appearance to balance out the initial sweetness. The alcoholic essence gets stronger as it warms.  Mouthfeel - Syrupy and viscous. Even some sensation of a very fine grittiness, probably from my aggressive pour on a 10-mo. old beer. Medium-bodied with low carbonation and very drinkable for as strong as it is. Would love to try this out of a snifter next time.  Overall, probably the best ""brown ale"" I've ever had.

Some visible carbonation in almost slow motion as if the beer's too thick for the bubbles to move through. Interesting. Fair amount of lacing. By all means a good looking beer but more akin to a stout than a brown ale  Aroma: Very sweet. Vanilla and smoky wood. Hints of dark plums and tart cherries. Maybe a little coffee. A scotch-like quality with a high boozy smell. Very different for the style but I wouldn't expect anything less from Dogfish Head  Taste: Chocolate and vanilla. Lots of malty caramel. Some coffee or espresso. Dark fruit. Definitely a charred quality. A nice balance. Sweet up front with a bitterness that starts out faint but becomes more apparent with a lingering finish. A tad boozy but it doesn't drink like a 12% at all. Really well done  Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy. Very smooth. Not much in the way of dryness which is surprising considering the ABV. Coats the palate nicely. Full bodied to say the least  Overall: Awesome brew. An excellent dessert beer but I don't think I could put away a 4 pack in one sitting. I feel like this would almost be better off as a bomber or 750. Regardless, this is a smooth sweet beer with a moderately complex and very nice flavor profile.

Label has ABV info, brewery info, small back story on the beer, web info, States “Malt Beverage aged on Palo Santo wood”. Neck label has DFH logo and says Palo Santo. Cap has DFH logo and looks like the rings of a tree. Bottled on date(8/13/12).  Appearance: Poured from its 12oz home into a 16oz snifter after a 15min warming allowance. Pours out a surprisingly thick deep cola brown almost black color with a 2 finger tightly packed tan foam head of medium density. Head retention was 4min 12sec before fading to a thick foam coating and ring. Excellent lacing.  Smell/Aroma: Smells of vanilla with a smokey woody tone. Has a sweet smell of candied dark fruits. Also has def hints of roasted coffee and chocolate malts. Has a slight booziness. Caramel scents come through as this warms.  Flavor/Taste: Tastes of roasted chocolate malts on the front-end with hints of vanilla. This gives way to a sweet plum flavor that immediately turns to the bitterness of dark roasted coffee malts. Finishes with hints of smoke and wood with a slight booziness.  MouthFeel/Drinkability: Full bodied and thick with a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable in limited quantities due to ABV.

A minuscule amount of dark tan foam appears on the surface and quickly dissipates. Several small bubbles of beer float on the surface that look like oil on water. They pop after a few seconds. Weird! When held up to the light, some dark reddish brown hue rings the very edges of the glass. This is one sexy beer.  Smell: I could smell the vanilla from several feet away before I even took a whiff. Underlying the vanilla is a bit of that brown ale ""twang"". A little hoppy. Perhaps some molasses and brown sugar. Maybe the tiniest bit of chocolate, but that is probably from the sweet vanilla combined with the hops that is playing tricks on me. I can't wait to take a sip.  Taste: Wow, what a great flavor! Vanilla in the forefront, with a slight hop bitterness on the tongue. A bit of a ""woody"" element is present as well. Alcohol is alive and well, but is nicely balanced.  Mouthfeel: Syrup! This one has low carbonation and a thick mouthfeel that leaves me ... chomping. Dry on the tongue after it goes down. A little sticky on my lips, but velvety smooth. I like this.

A - Surprised how thick this pours considering it is a brown ale and aged. A very dark coffee like brown with a thin tan foam head that quickly dissipated leaving a thin cap and lacing around the edges.  S - Aroma is very nice with sweet malt, wood, caramel, toffee, vanilla and syrup.  T - This beer really tastes great, but not like a brown ale would. Heavy malts and syrup with caramel, vanilla and wood mixed in. I don't notice much bitterness, but it isn't overly sweet. The booze is very well hidden.  M - Low carbonation as expected from the aging. Thick and chewy mouth feel from this unlike most brow ales which are much more thin.  O - Great beer than I really enjoyed. I'll have to get a hold of more some day. Do yourself a favor and pick some of this up because it is very tasty.

10099,33832,BeerForMuscle,4.07,"Had this on tap at DFH Brewpub in Falls Church, VA.  A - Poured almost black, with a dark brown top, fading quickly. A noticeable ring of lace, and residual rings lingering around the glass like sherry.  S - The nose is a bit metallic, definitely roasty and sweet, with warming alcohol present. Smells as strong as it is.  T - Very warming and pretty sweet. Alcohol forward here, but it's delicious and smooth. Bitter grains, metallic twang. Hints of charcoal and cocoa powder in the finish.  M - This one warms the mouth, and tingles the tongue, leaving a buzzing feeling on the palate and gums.  O - The 12% abv doesn't bite you or scare you off, it's tasty. It's well disguised for how high it is, but ever present. Caught me off guard when I read brown ale, as it drinks more like an Imperial brown or a Belgian strong dark ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Jazzpha,4.43,"Bottled on: 9/18/2012  Pour: Medium-slow, indistinguishable from a porter or stout. Most robust brown ale I’ve ever seen, by far. Half-finger of dark tan head fades fast, almost no carbination rising. Very, very few bubbles.  Aroma: Sweet, Old Rasputin-esque malt, quickly joined by the wood scent of the Palo Santo wood. A note of char as well, one of the most pronounced I’ve smelled.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Some beers make a smooth entrance, easing open your tastebuds before unfolding the rest of their flavors. This is not one of those beers. This thing gatecrashes your mouth and charges in full speed ahead, before assaulting your tastebuds like Old Rasputin’s crazy drunk uncle. Big, big bitter coffee notes, and dark chocolate. Bracing, powerful flavors all the way through. No sweetness to help you recover; this beer gives no quarter and I love it. Still, ridiculously smooth for 12%-- a lot smoother than the last time I remember having a bottle from this same 4-pack. Alcohol burn is limited to a slight tingle in the nostrils on the finish, like slightly mild horseradish. Malty goodness persists throughout the entire sip, and the mouthfeel is as big and chewy as an imperial stout, easily. The wood flavor borders on smoky at the very end of the finish, but in a way that smoothes out the taste in preparation for the next sip. This beer is a monster, and makes no apologies about that whatsoever. Either you roll with it or get rolled over, but I love this stuff.  Overall: This beer is awesome, definitely not sessionable, and best enjoyed savored over a decent period of time. Beastly in the most literal of senses. 4.5/5",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Molasses, vanilla, toffee, chocolate, hops, wood, and definitely some alcohol.  T- Very sweet, but not overly so. This is a little boozy, but a nice woody character compliments the alcohol along with toffee and some dark fruits. I'm a huge fan.  M- Thick, rich mouthfeel, Creamy and tingly at the same time. Very pleasant.  O- I really enjoyed this brew. This one is a sipper at 12%, but it's quite easy to suck right down.

10099,33832,macrosmatic,4.17,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a Cigar City pint glass.  A: Pours a very dark brown that lets almost no light through. A two finger brown head forms on top, and last pretty well. This rather looks like a glass of Coke, but with way less visible carbonation.  S: Toasted malt, cacao, sweet, a little boozy. Hints of vanilla, toffee, nuts. Some caramel character shows up as the beer warms a little. What aroma is here smells quite good, but there's not a huge nose on this beer.  T: Wow, this is a big ol' malt bomb! Roasty toasty malt flavors without being big on chocolate or coffee or any particular flavor, nor particularly bitter - the flavors all meld nicely. Then vanilla, toffee, and a woody sweetness. Minimal hop bitterness, and only near the swallow do they show up. As it warms up, I do start to get a bit more sweetness - dark fruit and raisins.  M: Thick, heavy mouthfeel and body. Carbonation on the low side. Alcohol is quite noticeable, but honestly not as much as I expected for a 12% beer. I'm not sure how to rate the beer here...I'm certain that this is out of the listed style, but the ABV is as well - I think the beer is in an entirely different category, though I'm not sure what it would be.  O: Not really my favorite style of beer, but I'm digging this one. I was going to write that it was a sipper, especially with the high ABV - but the glass is already half-empty. Not a beer that I would go back to often, but it is solid. Recommended to try, and expand what you think a Brown Ale can be.

The foam fades fairly quickly, leaving only a thin ring along the edges of the glass.  S: The nose is nose is sweet of vanilla and oak, boozy, and with just a hint of cedar spice. Smells great.  T: It starts out sweet with malt, some milk chocolate and a bit of vanilla. The beer starts to show it's massive alcohol content, but it's hidden well beneath the other flavors. As it moves into the middle I get some cedar and more vanilla oak. The spice is cranked up a notch as is moves towards the finish. Really nice.  M: Full bodied beer. It's sweet and sticky to start, coats the palate, and lingers for days. The alcohol is a bit overwhelming and warming, but I kinda like it.  O: Delicious beer. I had this years ago and loved it. I still really enjoy this beer. It's not something you'd pick up every day, but it's damn delicious.

Sweet brown ale malt. Don't think I can do justice to describe how complex the beer is.  Mouth feel is medium big. Drinks slowly as it should be.  Buy a 4 pack, drink 1 and cellar the rest.

S: Very pleasant notes of wood, sweet malts - kind of brings to mind woody...cappucino, almost with the sweetness and the coffee intermingling.  T: Very interesting flavor, very powerful wood especially in the finish. There's a booziness here that tingles the tongue - although at 12% ABV, that is certainly to be expected. The sweetness of caramel, vanilla notes, and alcohol shine at first, but wood comes up big in the finish. Exceptional balance of the flavors.  M: Medium to heavy, with light carbonation and a nice bit lingering on the palate. Very pleasant.  O: Very pleasant to sip on, nice appearance, and a good bit of flavor.

10099,33832,kagent777,4.26,"Excited to try this beer, poured into my CCB snifter after a short time outside the fridge. Bottled in 5/16/12, so almost a year old.  Appearance: This one is as black as any stout I have had. The head looks like a thin layer of tight tan foam bubbles. The lacing is sticky and persistent.  Smell: Roasty and malty followed by caramel and wood. At 12 ABV, I can smell the alcohol as well. Wonder how much longer this could have aged.  Taste: In addition to all of the above, I do get a note of vanilla in the taste as well. The wood character is slightly diminished from what I would have expected. I guess they do not call this one a stout because it lacks roasted un-malted barley? As it warms I get a molasses like taste coming in a bit. There is no oak flavor, but I do get a general wood like flavor. I suppose it would be from the Palo Santo wood used for aging. It does seem a bit smoother than your average RIS, with less hops bitterness as well.  Moutfeel: Very thick, but not unexpected. The flavors are huge and cover the mouth very well. The carbonation is expectedly low.  Overall: One of my favorite DFH brews. I could have sworn this was an RIS. A solid curve ball that I will have to look out for again soon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Lasting, dark brown head completes the effect- it really does look more like a stout than a brown ale. Minimal but decent looking lacing.  Smells like wood and caramel. Pretty blunt, but smells great.  Tons of bitter wood taste, with additional brown sugar, vanilla, oak, caramel, roastiness, and lots of alcohol. One of the more wood forward beers I've had, but I like it.  Full, sticky mouthfeel. Has the mouthfeel of a strong stout. Well carbonated.  A winner from Dogfish Head.

10099,33832,Zandramasrp,4.11,"Served in a tulip glass at approx. 45 degrees.  A - Somehow, I am surprised every time I pour this one out in how dark it is. While not completely opaque, like an imperial stout, it is still very dark. Thick. When swirled around the glass you can see how it sticks to the sides. Low carbonation and dissipates quickly, leaving some lacing. A good sign as I do not like much carbonation in my beer.  S - Can definitely smell the booze in this one. The vanilla is very up front as well. Sweet smelling like caramelized plums.  T - The taste is much like it smells. When it warms up a little the booze is even more apparent. Not sure what Palo Santo wood is like, but it seems to me to be very similar to aging in a spiced rum barrel, or perhaps bourbon. The vanilla is probably the main factor contributing to my previous statement. Might have preferred less of a spiced rum taste as it was very prominent.  M - Thick. I was not sure exactly what to expect from a 'Brown Ale' at 12% but I guess, thinking of it now, this might be it. Has the mouth-feel, if not the taste or smoothness, of an imperial stout. Makes you have to lick your lips occasionally because they will get sticky.  O - This is one of my favorite beers from Dogfish Head.

I have had this beer sometime last year, probably around when it was fresh, but I can't remember anything beyond that, so this is like a new experience to me.  Poured into a Firestone Walker pint glass.  A - Pours an oily, thick, dark-as-the-night shade of black. Aggressive pour yielded about a quarter inch of creamy brown head, dying out quickly. Thin ring of wispy lacing.  S - Smell is of roasted malts. Barrel-aged, wood smell, obviously. Potent alcohol booze smell. Chocolatey, but more vanilla. Slight hint of smoke. Earth & wood. A lot happening here, but it is all mostly subdued by the alcohol smell. As it sits, vanilla & caramel malts become it's dominant traits, as the bottle says.  T - Taste is of rich roasted malts, and a deep, lasting taste of spicy alcohol warmth from the Palo Santo wood. Sticky, coffee bean bitterness present. Almost a very fermented dark fruit / wine like quality to it. A smooth easy drinking beer, especially for such a high abv, yet it's just a bit too harsh for my liking. Very well-made, and an enjoyable & interesting concept though. I wonder what a few more years of age would do to one of these bottles.  M - Feel is dry, and slightly sticky. Hot alcohol lingerance.  Overall, a big hot boozy beer from Dogfish Head. Giant in it's concept and scope of originality, but to me, it is underwhelming. I will most likely try it again, but only because I am interested in seeing what some serious age would do to one of these bottles. Still, I'm loving the concept here.

Very pleasant.  T: At first I wasn't impressed, The coffee flavor was overpowering. But after I let it breath in the glass for about 15 minutes it really opened up. The coffee is still there, but it's not overpowering anymore, joined by subtle chocolate undertones and a nice hint of the wood, giving it a dark rum flavor. The alcohol bites at the end but it isn't unpleasant.  M: Medium smoothness, a little oily. Sticks on the palate, and not in the best way. I can't exactly explain it but the mouthfeel doesn't match the taste.  O: I don't love this beer. There are things I really like about it, but the mouthfeel is pretty off-putting.

Light lacing remains on the glass.  S: Cocoa and prune juice establish dark qualities in the smell. While spirituous, it does not come across as boozy here.  T: Begins off-dry, with vanilla extract, slightly cakey dark fruit, and floral aromatic flavors. Acidity is moderate into the middle where early flavors give way to peaking alcohol quality, with an overall medicinal effect. Drying cocoa powder and Dr. Pepper are observable amongst the muddled, earthy finish.  M: Thick viscosity, acidic on the palate, with moderate carbonation.  D/O: A challenging strong ale, this beer stands out because it is an (extremely) high-gravity example of its style. In fact, it forfeits most distinctive brown ale qualities, instead coming across as interchangeably Baltic porter/imperial Russian stout.

10099,33832,BruceBruce,4.58,"2011 bottle opened today, just WOW  A. It really doesn't matter, the stuff looks good  S. It is great, almost makes me think of bourbon but it has a hint of chocolate and alcohol  T. Light carb, but great flavor, bit of alcohol, then coco and bitter with a bunch of love and wood. It is great right now, I will admit I haven't had this fresh but will update with a fresh one after trying this.  M. Perfect, a little thick but great for the taste  O. I have passes this beer for a long time not realizing how great it was. I hope the fresh lives up to the vintage, but I could drink this all the time. I seem to get a bit of coffee (typical right) but this beer has really aged well not knowing what a fresh one taste like. Gets better as it warms and is everything I want out of this style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,TheSixthRing,3.7,"Appearance - Pours a deep, dark cordovan brown with a light tan, half finger head. Sub-par retention. Virtually no lacing.  Smell - Boozy aroma. Lesser notes of caramel, brown sugar and whiffs of faint vanilla.  Taste - Strong, boozy character. Caramel, chocolate, brown sugar sweetness. Molasses. Raisin. Subtle vanilla notes on the finish.  Mouthfeel - Full-bodied, near syrupy with low amounts of carbonation. Boozy, but smooth. Finishes bone dry.  Overall - Drinks much closer to a barleywine than it does a brown. Does nothing to hide it's boozy nature. Good, but for the price there are comparable brews I'd rather purchase.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,AaronHomoya,3.96,"Been aging this bottle of Palo Santo Marron for probably a year or so.  Quite an attractive brew. Very dark for a brown ale. Carbonation is now rather light. The head is dark tan and lingers nicely. The aroma started out boozy and a touch metallic. This faded though, and left mostly sweet caramel, dates and vanilla. The flavor is much more complex. Smooth, sweet with chocolate and dark fruit, then a bit of bite and hops and ending with vanilla, oak, some woody dryness and a bit of smoke. I really like the mouthfeel - not too thick, but pretty heavy. Has a dry, mouthwatering finish that makes you want more. Really nice.  Overall I am liking this beer with some age. It's not perfect, but there are some good things going on.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,mazeroski,3.14,"Appearance was great- a great dark maroonish-brown with a small head. I found the carbonation to be just a bit light, and I found it to have a cloyingly metallic aftertaste. Based upon the 6-pack I bought I cannot recommend this. I usually really like Dogfish Head, but this one missed the mark for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Tucquan,4.32,"Had this on 2013-02-17 in Bowling Green, KY  A - Completely opaque dark brown with a 1-finger light brown head that drops to a skim coating quickly but leaves good lacing.  S - Figs, dates, medium-dark roasted grain, woody, dark cherry, brown sugar. Very pleasant and pretty full aroma.  T - Much like the smell but the roasted grain has more char, there's carmel and brown sugar sweetness, raisin and dried cherry tang, which is well-moderated by the woody tannin, alcohol and good roasted and hop bitterness. It is very tasty; more like a fruity-roasted imperial stout than a brown ale.  M - Medium-heavy body and light-carbonation. Smooth, creamy, thick, clinging but not cloying.  O - I really enjoyed this brew. I had it at about 60 degrees and it seemed about right. Lots of flavors that I enjoy. Well-balanced. Well-done. Gonna have to add this to the have-again list.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,jvillefan,4.12,A: An extremely dark brown with a two finger head that hangs around for the entire length of the beer.  S: It smells of soggy roasted malts. I am not a fan of the nose of this beer.  T: Extrememly complex. It starts with some subtle chocolate flavors then goes into some dark fruit flavors with a alcohol. It finishes with a roasted oak flavor.  M: Great body and carbonation.  O: Great beer. Definitely worth a try.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Indybier,4.5,"Without breaking it down into micro-categories, I'll just say this is one hell of a bad-ass beer. Big, bold, complex, and tasty and hell. Sweet, bitter, smooth, delicious, etc, etc. Adjectives are boundless w/this one.  It took me an hour to finish one - mainly because it developed every-so-slowly in the glass and every sip was different than the last. Much more of a strong ale than brown, but, that's a very forgiving trait given just how good this beer is.  I would challenge any wine drinker/afficiando to sip on this for a while and take some notes.  IMO - one of the few $15+ plus four bangers out there actually worth the money.  Kudos, DFH...kudos!! A league of its own, if you will.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Cylinsier,4.24,"Tap pour, update of a previous review.  Pours dark brown opaque with an inch of yellowish head. Dissipates slowly.  Smells of brown sugar, grapes and molasses.  Tastes of molasses, grapes, and slightly acidic roasted coffee.  The mouthfeel is full with a warming sensation on the way down, light tingles of carbonation.  A good flavorful big ale. Fruity elements add a uniqueness and a balance to the more savory sweetness of the base malts. Hides it's strength well enough, but still a sipper. Another winner from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,CuteZombieDoll,4.32,"Poured into a tumbler glass  A- Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a thin but persistent head. Not very much lacing.  S- Dates and figs, with some alcohol on the nose.  T- Tastes very much like dried fruits, again reminiscent of dates, with some of a woody taste, and a little toasted malt. Has a pronounced alcoholic flavor, but not overwhelmingly so.  M- Fairly heavy, almost syrupy on the finish, which is typical for a beer this strong.  O- A top notch beer, but I was expecting the wood to add something a little more exotic. I don't really know if I notice the difference between this and just typical oak, but perhaps if I had them side by side I would. A solid brew, though, perhaps my expectations were a little too high.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Sokool,3.81,Pours a very very dark brown. Half a finger of dark brown head that dissipates quickly. Smells like figs or raisins with a hint of alcohol. Has a smooth wood/vanilla flavor with dark fruit and a warm boozey finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and heavy. Because of the sweet/malty nature of the beer the heavy mouthfeel makes it seem just a bit syrupy.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,CloudStrife,4.33,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled 08/13/12.  A: Pours a very dark brownish black with a half finger khaki head. Dissipates within a few minutes to just a ring around the edge. No real lacing. Light just barely gets through the edges. Trying to think of a darker brown ale.  S: Dark fermented fruits hit the nose first followed up by a rich carmel toffee and roasted malt. Certainly get some solid oakiness and vanilla from it that blends with the alcohol which is reminiscent of a bourbon barrel aged.  T: Dark fruits like fig and raisin dominate the flavor. A rich backbone of oak, vanilla and carmel compliment. A roasted malty aftertaste with a bit of smokiness. The oak really subdues any bite from the 12% abv.  M: Full body with a velvety smooth texture. Alcohol is surprisingly not very hot at all. On the low end of carbonation. Fairly clean finish, just a bit of stickiness.  Overall a very impressive beer from DFH. Has been a few years since I first had it and I certainly appreciate it more now. A well deserved beer of fame.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

I'm not sure the beer needs to be so strong, but it is rather tasty! That aging process really gives it a unique character. It's sweet, but balanced and you feel a slight bitterness in the middle that's rather nice.

10099,33832,GossageBrewery,4.76,"Poured this American Brown Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a midnight black color, produced a deep tan color head, great retention and left an outstanding amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of this American Brown Ale was pleasing, full of dark roasted malt and chocolate malt. Full bodied, like most Dogfish offerings, this American Brown Ale was heavy on roasted malted grain. That super malty foundation set the tone for the rest of the session. Perfectly balanced, there are not alot of complex flavors in this brew- and that is just fine with me- its everything a craft American Brown Ale should be,...Heavy on the Malt, super smooth, full bodied...well balanced. There are some suggestions of caramel and vanilla but they are faint. I can't say that I can honestly detect the Palo Santo wood- either from the aroma or the taste- but I also wouldn't know the aroma or it's flavor if it were right in front of my face. In this case I will just chalk up the San Palo experience to this...This is a damn good American Brown Ale- If South American San Palo wood refines this beers character, then so be it- If it doesn't, it is at least a great story and exemplifies all that Dogfish Head Craft Brewing is about- Off centered Ales for off centered people!

10099,33832,ferrouswolf,4.65,"Kept in the very back of my refrigerator for awhile. I figured I'd open one and see how it was. Bottled on 6/22/12.  Appearance: Deep opaque black/brown with a hesitant brown head that quickly dissipates to a ring around the edge. Some lacing. As you turn the glass you can kind of see that it's really really dark brown.  Smell: Coffee, ripe banana, caramel, chocolate, vanilla. Definitely very rich. Have this one with dessert-- perhaps bananas foster with a cup of coffee?  Taste: Chocolaty and bitter caramel up front with a deep coffee middle and a dry, cocoa-nib finish that really sticks around. Warming alcohol slips up the back of your throat into your nose, but it is well restrained. Each sip is a new experience; sometimes a coffee bean flavor comes through, other times the vanilla or the banana flavors work their way to the top. This is a beer to sip slowly, perhaps with a good book or a nice fire.  Mouthfeel: a little bit thinner than I would have expected for such a heavy beer, but the carbonation is just right.  Overall: this is a very unique beer, and should not be confused with other brown ales, American, English or otherwise. Perhaps this is really a porter? The combination of malt, fermentation and hops makes for a very good beer that must be tried to be understood. It is hard to know where one component ends and another begins, the mark of a well-balanced beer.

S: Big aromas of wood, vanilla, booze, cherries. Could have been better.  T: Whoa. Sweet, boozy, woody, and creamy like a port. Very complex. The booze is strong but adds to the beauty and craziness of this beer. Flavors of boozy cherries, dark chocolate, charred and fresh wood, earth, roasted malt. Dark and sweet fruits. Big time. I'd say it's a sipper because of the ABV% but it's a pleasure to drink. And too easy to put down. A malty, woody, and boozy brute.  M: Very smooth but also very boozy.

S: a blast of alcohol soaked figs and raisins, with an immense backbone of caramel, wood, and vanilla. very well balanced.  T: intense sugary sweetness of caramel, vanilla, dark fruits such as figs, raisins, possibly a slight plum. alcohol is still very much present, but it sits nice with the beer. the Palo Santo wood pushes the palate to another level and prevents the beer from being too sweet. as the beer warms i begin to pick up on some smokey, tobacco, and leather notes.  M: full bodied, and leaves a slight alcohol burn on the lips and a woody character on the palate in the after taste.  O: honestly, the immense sweetness reminds me of GI BCS. But unlike, BCS, it is not as well balanced (and it lacks the bourbon aspect). The heat is felt as it warms the lips and the stomach. Its a great brew.

10099,33832,MattSweatshirt,4.37,"Fills the snifter with a black body and light brown head. Reminiscent of a stout.  The smell is just wonderful. The wood really imparts itself into the beer. There is vanilla, the unique palo santo woodiness, and also a toasted coconut. Loads of malt lend itself to a raisin and fig dark fruit quality and dark bread. It is also quite sweet with caramel and molasses. Very inviting. No hint of the 12% harbored inside this brew.  Big dark fruit and woody characteristics abound here. Warmed up there is a touch of alcohol but for the most part it is hidden in this mass of vanilla, wood, raisins, syrupy sweetness, roast, and licorice.  The beer just glides down the gullet. It is thick and oily and all around smooth. The mild carbonation lends itself wonderfully to the feel. It lingers on the palette and dries it out leaving a nice woody aftertaste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

A - Darkest of brown. Nearly the look of a RIS except for the splashes of ruby red highlights seeping through. Expresso brown head quickly dissipates to a small ring of lace producing minimum stick.  S - Dark Fruit and Smoked wood character. Vanilla, chocolate, and a small whiff of molasses. Some crisp fruity alcohol esters in the backbone.  T - Caramel up front with Notes of wood and vanilla. Dark fruits and a Toasted bread. Bitter chocolate and mild coffee offer some bitterness to balance the sweet front. A smokey wood and toasted finish with hits of alcohol that linger nicely.  M - full bodied and very complex in the mouth. Alcohol has some warming to it, but its still a nice feeling brew. It's not thick, but it's not thin either. It's a good feel overall.  O - this is an interesting brown from DFH. The first bottle I opened took some getting used to, but the next was a excellent experience. For me most of DFH is a bit overrated, but this is a brew that is done very well. I think this will be fantastic after it sits awhile in the cellar which I'll review again. In terms of American brown ale this is one of the best and has a bit of everything for the snob who appreciates complexity and a unique high abv brew.

A: A slow pour into a standard pint glass produced about one finger of dark khaki head that dissipated to a collar after a few minutes and left some okay lacing and the glass emptied. The brew is a moonless-midnight black.  S: The aroma is a pleasant blend of vanilla, wood, smoke, toasted grain, and some sweet malt.  T: The taste begins with a big shot of sweet malt and vanilla. Very quickly some toasted grain, wood, and just a bit of booziness come along and balance the sweetness. And, to add even more complexity there are also some hints of dark dried fruit.  M: The body is heavy, full, and smooth; and, it is just a bit sticky. There is only a small amount of carbonation, which seems to fit this beer just right.  O: This is a great beer; and, it is available year-round. This beer is a style onto itself. It has the sweetness of a barleywine, combined with the complexity of black ale. The malt sweetness and the vanilla come very close to becoming cloying, but just in time the toasted grain, wood, a smooth booziness, and a few hints of dark dried fruit join in to add balance and complexity.

Taste has a lot going on - dark, almost burnt cherry taste, a bit of spiciness to the clear wood character, then moves to a more subtle bready, toasty, very faint nuttiness, and finishing with a hint of caramel sweetness. There's a noticeable alcohol, but it is warming not harsh. The feel is creamy, but thinner, not as viscose as a big beer would be fresh, with weak carbonation.  Overall, this is a complex sweet, woody treat. More complex than I remember it being, but I need to try a fresh one. The spicy wood character is interesting. No hops noticeable, but could be beneath the wood and spicy. Not too sweet. Nicely done.

Fair retention throughout. Aroma is warm, with hazelnut, chestnut, and vanilla. A faint amount of caramel comes through. I would say the predominant flavors are nutty, vanilla like, some smoke and bitter chocolate and honey. Alcohol is present for sure especially on the finish. Full bodied to match the full flavor, but finishes well and is nicely attenuated. Again there is alcohol on the finish. Overall this is one of my favorite dogfish head beers, if not favorite.

10099,33832,noel2977,4.08,"Hurricane Sandy review... I had cellared this bottle for 2 yrs and brought it up recently and put it into the fridge. Given we could lose power, i wouldn't want this one to go through more temperature change Poured into an ommegang chalice. Limited to no head - black, reminds me of cola that is almost flat. Bubbling laces finely on the glass. Aroma is of a subtle but nice blend of coffee with milk, chocolate and dark fruit. Hints of vanilla, not a forward as a fresh brewed PSM. Taste is wow - complex, for something that was two years in the bottle. I've had PSM fresh... I planned on getting a recently produced bottle to compare, but that dam hurricane changed my plans. Anyways... the taste:malty and chocolatey, which then slides into dark fruit flavors that are subtle (no over plummy/raisiny/pruny-ness) to a slight hop profile. There is some chocolate semi-sweetness that lingers and a coffee with milk flavor on the profile. Much more subtle vanilla tones to this than vs fresh. Interesting, the overall taste of this brew seems much more harmonious, with no alcohol burn or woodiness. Much more coherent than the fresh PSM I recall... I'll let this warm up a bit and see what develops Mouthfeel - creamy, with carbonation that meets expectations of the appearance. Overall - dam that storm... b/c this would be a great side by side tasting experience. PSM is an intriguing brew to begin with. I believe this settled down nicely. I'll enjoy it - a memorable storm brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,KKB,4.5,"A – Black. Straight black. With a little bit of reddish orange around the edges. It’s gotta be the darkest brown ale that I have ever seen, and is truly blacker than most stouts out there. The head is minimal and is a light cinnamon color. Really a good looking beer.  S – I have just been getting spoiled lately by all these stupidly good smelling beers. This is one of the best, most unique smelling alcoholic concoctions that I have ever had the pleasure of inhaling. I had a chocolate, licorice, caramel, vanilla, woody smell to it that I assume is attributed to the palo santo wood. Just such a phenomenal nose.  T – That is just a dream. Scandalously delicious. Hot diggidy dog, you get vanilla for sure, caramel absolutely, perhaps a caramelized sugar feeling in there as well, pecans! Oh the pecans; chocolate, and cherries. What a symphony. What an adventure. Delightful, supreme, awesome.  M –The mouthfeel, good god the mouthfeel, don’t even get me started. It is unblemished. Medium bodied? Sure. Light carbonation that makes for a silky smooth drinking experience? Of course. The malt in this bad girl make is so that it feels like you’re really drinking something. You know? Really drinking it. Not just mucking about. And it’s good…oh and wonderful warming sensation and all that jazz…but for real, badass, spot on warming goodness. Yahtzee.  O – Yes. So much yes. I don’t know what’s going on with this ridiculous wooden barrel that is larger than any created since the prohibition, I don’t know what Palo Santo wood actually tastes like (but if I’m ever on vacation and a tree gets pointed out to me I’ll be sure to take a nibble) but I do know a glorious beer when I drink one. And ladies and gentleman, you want to know, is this good beer?

10099,33832,JamesShoemaker,3.95,"12 oz bottle shared with my girlfriend, tulip and snifter.  A - this beer is a very deep brown, very little head, just a little lacing on the side. Lighter on the periphery, fading into darkness in the middle.  S - can't smell the booze, which is good, because this guy packs a wallop. I can definitely detect the uniqueness in the aging wood here; something deep, meaty, big.  T - wow, a big taste, full of alcohol and syrup, with only a touch of the wood at the very end. I can tell, like WWS, that I'm going to like this a lot more in a year or two.  M - not great. Too reminiscent of other DFH high ABV offerings.  O - I'm excited to age my remaining bottles, but in the meantime I'm pretty disillusioned.

10099,33832,duracell,4.58,"12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  A - Pours a very very dark brown color with a large, brown head which has a medium retention and a good lacing. Relatively surprising! 3/5  S - Strong malt, some alcohol (quite obvious), caramel, dark fruits, chocolate, vanilla, nutty, wooden character and some freshness coming from the hop. 5/5  T - Flavors develop in 3 steps: 1) Malt, some spiciness from the alcohol; 2) Strong liquorice notes with some fruity character; 3) Hop and coffee at the end. 4.5/5  M - Carbonation is spot on. Full body. Obvious notes of alcohol which give a warming feeling. 4/5  O - Definitely an extreme example of the style (could be confused with an Imperial Stout). Off-centered as claims DFH's moto!

10099,33832,alamere,4.67,"A - well, it's dark black... like a stout basically... lacking in head and lacing, but at 12% abv I think that's appropriate to be honest  S - Smells of dark chocolate and almost a wine like alcohol thing going on. maybe some fig and dark fruit type of currants going on as well... Not a huge nose on this beer, but what is there smells absolutely fantastic.  T - Beer really doesn't taste much better than this in my opinion... and I've had a LOT of beer to be honest. This is the top of the food chain regarding how a beer taste and how original it is.  M - This beer is smooth, and for the ABV isn't carbed like an IPA.. which I think just adds to the smoothness even more. It's a subtle detail.. but really kind of a perfect choice. Kudos to Dogfish on that  O - This is flat out original, big, alcohol heavy and a super smooth drink. This beer is one of the many reasons to love craft beer. It's 100% original and fantastic... not what I'd want to drink every night by any stretch.. but the perfect sip for a cold and rainy Pacific NW evening!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, slight soy sauce, wood, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick and a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

It's sweet, but not sickening sweet.  M: Thick, almost syrupy. But it's smooth, which is surprising for a beer that's a bit thick, this sweet and this strong.  Overall: One of the best beers I've had. Not my favorite ABA but it packs a punch and tastes really good.

Nose is super woody with notes of vanilla, figs, chocolate, heavy roasted malts, slight booze and something sticky like molasses and burnt brown sugar. The taste is soooo damn smooth. I haven't had a Palo Santo in a while but I don't remember them drinking like this. Amazing what 20 months will do. There are some fruity notes right up front like dates, figs and maybe some plum. There are heavy tones of wood, it has notes of burnt sugar, dark chocolate, raisins, booze, molasses, some dark cherries and vanilla all wrapped up with a sweet (but not too sweet) finish. The carbonation is really low, the mouthfeel is silky and surprisingly light for this beer. A couple of years took an already amazing beer and made it even better.

Liked it very much",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,sophisticated,4.35,"I typically do not get excited about brown ales but this one, I enjoyed. I've had most DFH brews but somehow overlooked this one. I sometimes enjoy their stranger offerings, but sometimes the high ABV ones are a little much for me.  The Palo Santo - A) Beautiful. Super dark but quick carbonation and thick sudsy brown head made it look almost like a soda. The head lasted a long time and left a big ring and lace around the glass. Lovely to look at.  S) Upon opening the bottle, malts POURED out. Definitely some vanilla and caramel; inviting smell.  T) Upon first drinking this I wrote ""oh wow"" for both the taste and the mouthfeel. Super silky and smooth; and the taste is strong. Sweet malts and plum flavors dominate. Also some spice, wood-y-ness, no flavor of alcohol but the feel is there.  D) Why haven't I had this one before? I'm a big fan. More Brown Ales should be like this. :)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,andrewjraab,3.95,"a - Pours a viscous thick as hell pitch black with a brownish tint of creamy head that remains as a ring around the glass the entire drink.  S - Chocolate, malt, oak, alcohol, and so much more. A lot going on here  T - Malty up front. Deep wood flavor with a nice sweet chocolate flavor balanced with an alcoholic and nicely bitter finish. As this beer came to room temp, a lot of the nuances and subtle flavors came to the forefront. This drinks more like a stout than a Brown Ale.  O - This is an incredibly smooth (for 12%) and unique offering from DFH. IMO, it is not as good as Burton Baton (from DFH), but it is solid and definitely worth a try.  Note - I thought the description on the bottle was funny - ""We have wood. Now you do too.""  ---3/2/14  I set one of these down for over a year. This is really worth it to age one.  A - maintains a nice mocha head - color is the same.  S - Some faint smoke pulls out, more of the wood is coming out. Same rich chocolate notes, some fruit are more present.  T - Overall rich and complex as previously reviewed. Smooth as hell - creamy.  O - Nicely ages after 15 months.

10099,33832,cbutova,3.8,"It's been 3-4 years since I have had this. Was a total BA noobie when I first tried it and it destroyed my palate. Finally time to review it.  A- Poured into the signature DFH snifter with a very dark brown body. Mocha tan head builds nicely to about a finger with a creamy, foamy texture. Head retention is decent for such a big beer. A big bubbly, creamy ring around the glass leaves a lot of legs but not much permanent lace.  S-Right away you can tell this is a big beer. This is not because of alcohol, which there is a nice hint of, but the large amount of aromas overall. ""Brown Ale"" jumps right out at you with a big dose of brown sugar, raisins and nutty notes. Certainly spices, figs, roast grains, vanilla, wood and dark fruit in there too. Really big and complex, reminds me of some Belgian Strong Dark offerings in a way.  T- Roast malts add more here than in the nose. The beer really opens up with a big cocoa presence here as well as the big raisin, brown sugar, caramel, spice, fig, dark cherry, roast grains and alcohol notes. Alcohol picks up here and is a slight flaw towards the end. The wood has a unique flavor, it reminds me of really fresh oak. Fairly sweet but nowhere near the average DFH big beer.  MF- Creamy and thick body which really satisfies the palate. Silky, lower-end carbonation and a fairly warm alcohol presence overall.  The 12% really starts to show about 2/3 of the way through the beer. It doesn't kill the beer but makes it a slow sipper. Complex and big with a great roasty Brown Ale, almost Strong Belgian feel.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,DRyan,4.27,"A: Looks like a porter or a stout, very dark black with dark tan head, but not nearly the thickness of head of a stout. The head dissipates somewhat quickly and laces. S: Smells sweet, chocolately, vanilla, molasses T: Roasted malt at the forefront with strong sweetness, has a vanilla like quality with a little woody undertone, finishes with a small hop bite and a small alcohol kick M: Smooth and velvety, very mildly carbonated D: Not easily chugged, but easy to drink for 12% ABV for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,SebD,4.5,"Appearance: It has a nice dark brown (almost black) color to it. It has a nice thick tan head that dies down slowly and leaves some nice lacing.  Smell: The aromas definitly give out hints of dark fruit (raisins, grapes) along with some sweet caramelly malts, a hint of chocolate, molasses and a nice woody note from the Palo Santo Marron wood.  Taste: Like the aromas, it has a nice dark fruit character (raisins, grapes and prunes) with some sweet caramelly malts, sugary molasses, slight chocolate and a nice woody character.  Mouthfeel: It has a low/medium carbonation with a nice overall balance and feel.  Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas.

10099,33832,Vicirus,3.57,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Portsmouth tulip. Bottled 10/23/08. Aged nearly four years.  Appearance: A half bottle pour into the center of the glass yields a thin almost non-existent head that retreats to the edge of the glass. Dark, dark brown in color that barely allows any light to pass through.  Smell: First the dark fruit - raisins, plums, and prunes. Next comes a woody, almost cedar scent followed by a slight booziness.  Taste: The taste really follows the aroma. Initially you get strong raisin, pruney flavors followed by molasses, burnt sugar, and the palo santo wood. The 12 abv is well hidden, until half way through the bottle.  Mouthfeel: Very thin with almost no carbonation. It has a slickness that coats the mouth, and lingers too long. Probably the low point of this beer.  Overall: Dogfish was my gateway to craft beer so I bought up everything I could get my hands on. This happened to be one of their only beers I didn't particularly like, so after drinking 3 bottles, I stashed the last one away until now. I remember specifically not liking the flavor the wood gave to the beer, but now it's fairly subdued. With four years on it, it resembles more of a barley wine or old ale than a brown ale. Unfortunately, I've never been a fan of dark fruit flavors in my beers, so it wasn't really for me, although I'm sure many others would really enjoy it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Smell: woody, sweet and bready malts, dark fruits, booze, and chocolate  Taste: all of the above plus some vanilla, spiciness, tobacco musty and sweetness, raisins and other dark fruits. Very tasty beer.  Mouthfeel: silky smooth, full bodied, delicious, medium carbonation, boozy, and easy to drink.  Overall: super solid brown ale if it put into that category.

No appreciable head, but not really a problem given the oiliness of the pour. maybe a couple mm of fine dark tan head, drops quickly but with some decent lacing, given the head. An ultra-dark reddish brown - almandine garnet.  S - Very nice. Prunes. Raisins. Ton of booze. Very sweet. Pepper, wood, tobacco lurking under the surface. Spiced fruit all over the place, but very nicely complex.  T - BOOM. As you might expect given the strength and ageing, again very flavorsome and complex. Tobacco, spice, melded hop aroma, espresso, and dark dried fruits start up, to be replaced by alcohol warmth and pepper, then hop bitterness, then wood. Miles and miles of burnt wood. Hints of honey come and go. Sucks all the moisture from your mouth, but in a good way. Delicious and very well balanced, though quite tart.  M - Like drinking engine oil. I imagine. Carbonation is present, but just in the feel; no detectable actual bubbles by a few minutes after pour. Suits the style very well. Flavor hangs around, but not intrusively... definitely more of a feel than a taste.  Overall - excellent beer, if you like an aged beer. Drink it slow, though I can't imagine anyone wanting to take big gulps.

10099,33832,Darkmagus82,4.17,"Poured from bottle into snifter  Appearance – Pours a nearly black color with a small one finger tan head. The head fades quite fast to leave a light level of lacing.  Smell – The aroma is sweet and boozy. A strong dark fruit aroma of raisin, grape, and prune are big and bold matched only by a good wiff of alcohol. Mixed with these aromas are some lighter aromas of a woody nature as well as some smells of vanilla and some roasted malt and chocolate. Overall quite robust and delicious.  Taste – The beer is not as sweet as would have been detected from the nose. While not as sweet as expected it is as boozy as would be expected from the nose. The taste begins with a lightly fruit sweetened taste with a big roasted malt and a dark bready taste. As the taste moves on, a woody and oaky flavor comes to the tongue with some lighter tastes of vanilla and a bourbon like alcohol taste. While the alcohol is lighter in the middle of the taste it gains strength as the flavors move on. In the end the alcohol is rather strong; leaving a warming and light oaky bourbon burn on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The beer is thick and creamy in body with a lower to medium level of carbonation. Its thick body suits well the very warming nature of the beer.  Overall – Pretty boozy but it is nice and warming and has some wonderful flavors.

Smooth chocolate, nutty, creamed coffee, vanilla, applewood and hot booze with balancing bitter hop oils coming through in the finish. The alcohol is there but much less intense than expected for 12% abv.   Full creamy body with subtle but effective carbonation.  A brown ale, eh? Call it what you will but this is thicker, richer, roastier and more complex than a lot of stouts out there. I'm a Dogfish Head skeptic but this is some mighty fine work.

Head dissipates rather quickly and leaves no lace.  Smell is light cocoa, some virgin wood, tobacco, and some dark fruit and a bit of alcohol. Kind of smells like a Cabernet. Interesting but I think I like it.  Taste is dark roasted malts, chocolate, fig, wood, and some rather strong alcohol. Quite nice.  Mouth is medium with carbonation on the light side. Body is medium as well and the finish is average long and on the wet side.  I must say this is a very interesting tasting beer. It has a lot of the same tastes that other barrel aged beers have but this one has it's own little twist. It is so much like a wine in taste and smell but it does still keep it's beer profile.

So many flavors it was hard to pinpoint them, but not in an annoying way. Sugar, cedar, oak, red wine, vanilla, caramel, and of course, alcohol. Yum.  Overall: a very very nice beer.

A half finger of thick, tan head lingers for quite a while.  The smell is of bitter, but smooth high-cocoa dark chocolate. A nice vanilla presence -- and wood, dense yet subtle.  The taste has a nice, dark malt backdrop, over which dangles a harmonious blend of alcohol heat, vanilla, and palo santo wood. The heat and the wood work together, enhancing and sharpening the beer, while not becoming too overpowering. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and neither too thick, nor too thin.

Chewy malts begin the intense experience with all the flavors of the nose to follow. Easily can detect the wood this brew was aged upon. Warm throughout but very subtle for a beer as gigantic as this one.  M - Full-medium body, medium carbonation and a fine progression.

10099,33832,JamesMN,4.5,"Poured a 12oz bottle into the DFH signature glass.  Appearance: Opaque blackness with a very small light brown head.  Aroma: For a big beer the smell is very clean. I get the vanilla and some faint dried fruits. Also a smoke-like hint of the palo santo wood. Earthy. Real nice.  Taste: For a dark beer this is nicely hopped. The bright character of the hops sits at the top of your palate as the malty undertones and alcohol ride below it. The aftertaste remains bright with a nice woody quality and a warmth from the alcohol. I'd say the 12% abv isn't completely hidden but it adds a nice flavor almost like a liqueur. The more you drink the more roasted malt profiles come out. Dark chocolate and caramel. A zingy coffee-like bitterness lingers for a while. Definite Imperial Stout qualities.  Mouthfeel: Super smooth and above average drinkability, especially given the style. Great level of carbonation. There's no question that this is a full bodied beer, it just drinks like something smaller.  Final Thoughts: I was really lucky to get my hands on this one as we don't get DFH in MN.

This is, by far, the darkest brown ale I have ever experienced. Thick and viscous, nearly black, with great retention and lacing.  The smell gives off a bit of fruit and cedar, and some tobacco. A little bit of caramel as well - just a bit.  The taste is certainly rich - raisin, sugar, date, and a light sourness that I cannot put my finger on to finish. A very complex beer nonetheless. This is one hell of a full-bodied beer, and the twelve percent alcohol content is well-concealed.  Overall, this is the best brown I have ever tasted - it just seems to have more... well, brown-ness to it than any other brown I've had, although I haven't tasted too many aged browns.

10099,33832,Nugganooch,3.68,"Notes from 08/11/12 *12oz bottle to taster flute  A: Holds the appearance of an RIS. Super dark. More black than brown actually with a thin turbinado sugar head that slips out to a crown rather quickly. Some nice oily glass coat.  S: The aroma is forward with wood. A sort of 60/40 mix of cedar and oak. Very earthy in roast. Nutty grains, toffee, spice, and some alcohol bring up the remainder of the nose. Pretty nice and unique.  T: Taste delivers the wood as well. Again bit of a of a mix between a spicy cedar and more earthy oak. I get roasted almond and hazelnut, molasses, dark pit fruit, some umami, and brown sugar. Grain roast is deep and caramelized mixing well with some underlying vanilla and tannins. The bitterness level seems rather high bringing in an herbal hop component. There is a sharp alcohol bite with some heat on it that is a little distracting. Flavors deteriorate quite a bit after mid-palate. This definitely drinks more like a RIS or Old Ale.  M: Moderate viscosity and a somewhat heavier body this brown ale maintains a smooth creamy texture with a touch of froth. Even carb and a high intense bitter bite bring a slight crispy snap. Finish is more wet and oily.  D: Had a hard time really liking this one. A lot going on here and the flavors seemed to get a bit muddled rather than develop on the palate. Not personally the beer I would have selected to showcase the wood either. Drinks more like an aged Old Ale or even some RIS’s.

I'm trying to review it as a brown ale, not just a beer, and I've never had a brown ale this dark and dense; I'd say it's a good beer, but a little bit heavier than I'd expected.

Thick coating of lacing.  Nose Cedar, caramelized brown sugar, saw dust, hints of vanilla and some citrus notes going on.  Taste Upfront – Molasses, saw dust, maple syrup and perhaps a hint of cherry. Mid-palate – Syrup, caramelized brown sugar, cedar and fig. Finish – Bittersweet chocolate, earth and oak.  Mouthfeel Medium-full bodied, velvety, smooth, semi-chewy, warming and sticky.  Overall Hides the 12% abv pretty damn well. This is a huge, malty monster of a Brown Ale.

10099,33832,LiquidAmber,4.17,"Review from 1/2010 notes. Poured into a flute glass. Pours a deep, deep red brown with a thin off white head. Aroma of caramel malt, dark fruit and wood. Flavor of caramel, roasted malt, cherries, dates, unidentifiable dark and light fruit. Woody, similar to oak, from the Palo Santo. Rich mouth feel. Surprisingly subdued aftertaste; a bit boozy. A complex and very interesting brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,ThisWangsChung,3.47,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter.  A: Pours an almost pitch black color with very little light coming through. Very little head to speak of, aside from a very thin tan-colored collar. A brown ale that thinks it's an imperial stout? This now has my attention.  S: Caramel, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits, booze, and oak comprise the aromatic qualities. Faint, but forgivable given its lack of head.  T: The flavor sees an uptick in the nuttiness befitting a brown ale, especially on that first sip. Caramel, roasted coffee, licorice, toffee, and vanilla make an appearance on the midtaste and finish, but it could stand to be a touch more complex. The aftertaste has a good amount of darker fruits and anise, but otherwise, the general flavor profile gives off a vibe of spiked hazelnut coffee. Pretty damn boozy and tannic. Honestly, this could pass for a fruitier imperial stout along the lines of Stone IRS, rather than a rinky dink, run of the mill brown ale. I'd call it out on not having enough in the way of roastiness, but you know, brown ale, and stuff...  M: I'd call it medium bodied, perhaps ever so slightly erring on the side of light. Weakly carbonated, like I expected. The finish and aftertaste tries to strike a balance between tannic dryness and sticky wetness, and just about pulls it off, right before the tannins fade a little on the palate. Booze isn't particularly stealthy, so sip this one, preferably at a higher temperature. EDIT: It actually becomes quite hot at a higher temperature, so I'm lowering the score here. Yeesh, this is practically burning.  O: I've heard of porters that think they're stouts, but a brown ale that thinks it's an imperial stout? In its current state, it's pretty enjoyable, but still too young and hot. This could become great with a year of age, and it's readily available/cheap-ish enough (for what it is, $15/4 pack isn't chump change) to make picking up a 4 pack to age a worthy endeavor.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,mschind,4.64,"A- Looks like a stout to me, dark opaque brown with a one finger coffee foam head that quicly dissipated leaving a thin cap and lacing around the edges. The appearance is great but brown ale?  S- Caramel, coffee, licorice and chocolate, even some cinnamon.. Alcohol in the backgroud.  T- Looks like a stout, tastes like... an out of control brown ale. Huge malty sweetness that gets balanced by something without going into the stout bitterness I was expecting. Hard to tell this weighs in at 50 IBU's but there has to be something to offset the massive malt. A nice bit of alchemy. Everything in the nose is here too.  M- Full bodied without being syrupy. Carbonation is on the low side which lets the maltiness shine.  O- So what if the SRM is off the scale for a brown ale. DFH consistenly pushes the envelope and this is a great example. So many ways this could go wrong but it doesn't. A good one to offer to non-beer lovers as an example of what great beer can taste like.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Hopdaemon39,4.15,"DFH recommends paring this with chorizo- it works well.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a nonic tumbler- pours an incredibly dark brown (pretty much black), with one finger of mocha head, decent retention, a few streaks and dots of lacing.  Smells of dark and roasted malts- a little sweet, a little semi-sweet chocolate, a slight twinge of booze.  Taste is full and rich- lots of roasted malt (almost like an imperial stout), some brown sugar, nice round wood notes, a little booze, and some hops towards the end. Does not taste like 50 IBU but the hops somewhat balance out the extreme malt flavors.  Mouthfeel is all right- full body, mild soft carbonation. Long semi-sweet finish.

10099,33832,57md,4.52,"Appearance is a deep rich brown with almost a finger of beige head that did not linger long, but left some nice lacing in its wake. The nose is distinctly malty and has accompanying notes of vanilla and caramel.  This offering has a very hardy body for a brown ale. The flavor is rich and malty with clear notes of the wood barrel present. There is a hint of alcohol on the finish, but it is mild considering the amped up ABV of this beer.  This is not your father's brown ale, this is something else altogether (in a very, very good way).  March 2016 Update: Had a two-year old bottle is celebration of Easter/Ostara. Surprisingly, aging did not seem to do this gem of a beer justice. The beer seemed past its prime and the alcohol was as potent as a fresh version.

Dissipates pretty quickly, leaving some, but not much, lacing on the way down.  S: First thing I noticed was coffee, followed by dark fruits and berries. Has a dark chocolate smell to it. Y'all, this beer smells incredible. After a second smell, I'm realllly noticing the dark chocolate.  T: WOW. Really, really good. I got dark fruits up front (and a little booze, but hey it's a 12% ABV beer) followed by toffee, malts, and a coffee/dark chocolate after taste. This is one of the most complex beers I've had.  M: Full-bodied and smooth. You get a little burning booze on the tongue but not much. Very drinkable. Dangerously drinkable.  O: This beer lives up to the hype. Awesome.  Update: I tried a second bottle the day after and this time noted some additional nuttiness. it's possibly that I missed it because of the lower temperature I had it at the first time. This is just an awesome, complex beer.

This smells like bitter but sweet desert. Caramel is in there, as well.  T. Chocolately brown sugar, and molasses. Vanilla, something burnt but enjoyable, it's delicious. I definitley taste wood, but it's not as overwhelming as may have thought.  M. Smooth and rich. Very agreeable, perhaps a slight bite at the end.  O. Love this beer.

10099,33832,ElCommodoro,4.33,"Pours a thick, obviously opaque, brown with very little head. The smell is that of Home Depot or a cedar tree. VERY woody. I like that, but I'll admit it's a bit excessive. But that's just the smell. The taste is fantastic. The wood is present in appropriate amounts to add some serious complexity to what is otherwise normal, boring unfiltered brown ale. The unfiltered brown backbone of this is not something I'm generally a fan of. I feel like the thick oiliness of the lack of filtering can actually hurt the flavour of a brown ale sometimes by making it too thick and masking flavours that can present themselves in a thinner concoction. However, this particular ale is fantastic. It takes that thick brown, malty ale with all the stuff a beer can have crammed into it and it adds a nice woody texture to make it a VERY interesting beer. Sadly, the unfiltered yeast covers up A LOT of the alcoholic bite that should be present in a 12% beer, but most people reading this will probably like that. It's still got enough bite to keep me interested, but it is VERY disguised. So, be prepared to be hit hard. The complexity here is not as amazing as a good quad or a Samichlaus, but it's not far off. I will continue to be enticed by anything aged in wood. Such beers have yet to disappoint me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Quite a bit of heat to this one that flows into some nice sweetness of vanilla, there's some woodiness, and some sugared breadiness. Not much activity, a nice fuller body.

10099,33832,davey101,4.52,"02/02/12, 12 oz bottle into a DFH signature glass.  A - Pitch black body, a two finger high mocha head forms. Moderate lacing and retention, has some alcoholic legs to it.  S - Wood. But not any lumber yard special, no, no. This is some fancy wood. I'm not exactly a wood connoisseur so I'll just leave it at ""pallo santo wood"". This ""wood"" has a certain sweetness and spice to it that works really well on top of some traditional brown ale notes. Brown sugar and caramelized bananas is what really stands out though. In the background there is coffee, vanilla and cocoa powder against lightly roasted malts with a slight mineral thing going on. The aroma is so complex and unique, but its coming off like a barrel aged bananas foster themed beer.  T - It starts off very stout like with roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, oak, and chocolate. But then comes this mildly bitter yet sweet wood favor that is fruity yet smokey and dense. Again, bananas foster. Just as complex and unique as the nose, but less satisfying. It does leave an aftertaste in the mouth that is woody. The mouth feel is medium bodied and syrupy with a high level of carbonation. There is a touch of complimentary warming alcohol, but it doesn't interfere at all.  O - Dogfish Head is just so damn unique. I've had this beer a few times, including a bottle that was about 3 years old. I think I prefer it fresh. So much is happening, and the aroma is just perfect and so enticing.

Dark as night with a nice-looking finger of light brown head. Laces like a motherfucker. Not used to looking at this beer in a pint. Head rush overflowed down the sides after the pour, and believe me when I tell you, this glass is sticky.  Bright palo santo wood character upfront that's rathery cedary. Rich coffee, Madagascar Vanilla, and molasses notes in the sweetness. Heavy roasty notes and evident booze.  Woody and bright despite caramelly-rich and boat-sinking maltiness. Maple sweet with coffee, char, booze, toffee, vanilla, bitter roast, and unique barrel wood. The palo santo staves catapult this ale from 'great-tasting' to 'epic'.  Thick and a bit syrupy.

Some mild lacing as the cap retreated. Sip marks emerge as I move my way through.  The vanilla beans pop a little more than the coffee, but both are very noticeable on top of the wood, caramel, toffee, cocoa powder, and rum soaked fruits.  I find Palo to be a vanilla forward beer to begin with, so the addition of the fresh vanilla beans really made this pop. The coffee beans help bring down the sweetness a notch, blending with the oak and rum soaked fruits on the other end of the spectrum.  Medium to full body, smooth, easy drinker. A touch of booze leaves its mark.  This is like an amped up version of Palo with more robust vanilla notes and the addition of roast coffee to the mix.

Alcohol can be detected.  T: There is a nice complexity to the flavors of this beer with some light amounts caramel sweetness, vanilla, bittersweet chocolate, raisin, coffee, and possibly rum. But the dominant flavor is from the wood that it was aged in.  M: Medium to full bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth with alcohol warming in the finish and some light amounts of dryness.  O: This beer is pretty easy to drink but you would be better off sipping it - you can more greatly appreciate the subtly of the flavors and the high ABV will really sneak up on you otherwise.

You know it’s different as soon as you pour it. This is definitely a sipper due to the presence of alcohol throughout.

Look: Color was a deep dark brown - almost black with zero transparency. The head was a thin coating of brown foam with some head-lacing already noticeable.  Smell: Aroma was a very earthy caramel with an alcohol booziness. Also notes of coffee and roasted malts.  Taste: First was a sweet note of molasses. Then a slight warming sensation hit. A very nice roasted note took over. The finish was of a burnt brown sugar that lead into a roasted aftertaste.  I actually had this beer a couple years ago but didn't have the same appreciation for these types of offerings at the time. I can definitely say this will now be another addition to my beer cellar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Smell: A nice strong blend of cocoa, smoked wood, brown sugar, and a red wine. I also get a little vanilla.  Taste: It starts and progresses through a smokey wood and chocolate flavor and then hints of vanilla and red wine. Some residua hops bitterness (not surprised). Finishes with a smooth spiced touch.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Quite nice, an I wasn't really feeling or expecting the 12% which they balance quite well.

Flavor is notes of chocolate, coffee and dark caramel with heavy wood notes--oak, vanilla, and a really unique character for the Palo Santo wood. Barrels contribute sweet flavors of coconut and smoke. Unique. Alcohol is definitely noticeable, but I wouldn't peg it as 12 percent ABV.  Medium mouthfeel, mildly carbonated.  This is a good beer, and probably my favorite from Dogfish Head. I don't always like their experiments, but this Palo Santo wood was a good move. It tastes more like a porter or stout than a brown ale, and it's like your typical barrel-aged offerings--but only kind of.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

I get a little of the nail polish remover taste, but it's not a killer. It still has a nice sweet dark fruit, smokey, earthy, carmel, complex flavor that is worthy of a strong brown ale.

10099,33832,rob119,4.18,"12oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass, bottle was chilled to around 40 degrees.  I am a big dfh fan and beers like this help reinforce that fact.  Smell is definitely porter-like, but with more espresso and an unfamiliar spice I can only attribute to the palo santo wood.  It poured like a lot of homebrews Ive seen, but the 1 finger head changing from copper orange to brown quickly then disappearing was very interesting.  Taste is awesome, which is why I bought it. Honestly the alcohol is hidden VERY well. The earthy coffee thick bold flavor is worth every penny.

10099,33832,JonnyVendetta,4.35,"This self described ""EXTREME"" beer, is shy of its claim, but a step above the norm for Dogfish.  It pours like a light syrup with a deep brown color and amber accents. The head failed to appear, but excited copper bubbles danced on the top in its place.  The mouthfeel of the beer is surprisingly pleasant despite the high alcohol content. It is very present on your breath at first, but fades as the malty carmel flavor dominates. The vanilla never really broke through until the very end.  Design:  Dogfish focuses on a cross section of Lignum vitae wood (Palo Santo) with a wood grain background.  They go to the extent to explain that they are very excited about this beer and it's woody housing, and that that are bearers of such wood. ""It's all very exciting. We have wood. Now you do too.""

It pours black with a nice 2-3 finger tan head. Nice sweet, roasted malt aroma.  Tastes of vanilla, caramel, chocolate with a hint of licorice.  The surprise for me was the drinkability and mouthfeel for 12% abv. While the alcohol is present it is not overbearing, nor is the mouthfeel to thick.  All in all a very delicious beer.

A: Pitch black with a frothy, three-finger head of tan foam that settles to a thin, creamy head of lace. Dark and inviting with an espresso-like head.  S: Spicy, bold, earthy wood aromas rise from the brew and combine with a bittersweet, chocolate-espresso smell. Bits of bourbon, vanilla and oak are woven into the dark, complex nose.  T: Warm, sweet and oakey up front, the roasted malts grip the tongue first and splash on the bourbon, bittersweet, herbal coffee and dark chocolate flavors. The sweetness gives way quickly to hot, boozy and herbal bitterness that pulls in more velvety malt notes. The finish is very warming with a slick, bittersweet and oily vanilla and woody flavor. Complex and luscious.  M: Full-bodied, slick and rich mouthfeel with a lingering, oily and hot bourbon-aged, smooth finish.  O: A robust, imperial American brown clocking in at 12% ABV; leave it to DFH to corral the chaos. A deep sipper, this would go really well with a blackened Angus burger topped with Stilton, a flourless chocolate torte or a smoky selection from the humidor.

Lacing stuck around the edge all the way through.  S: Very nice amount of things working out here. Hints of coffee and dark chocolate/caramel working thru. Allowed the beer to warm a bit after first smell and it seemed to become more intense with a few other earthy aromas coming thru. Slight hint of alchol poking thru as well.  T: Very nice. So much going on in my mouth, very nice deep and rich flavors. Def coffee/dark chocolate and alot of earthy wood/oak flavors make it very complex and enjoyable on my palette. Sweet flavor, maybe a hint of vanilla, not sure mostly tasting the bold flavors and then the alcohol at the end.  M: Light carbonation thru out, mouthfull brings out some sweeter flavor and then gets to the deeper darker bolder flavors but still ends with a sweetness that i'm really enjoying. Impressed with this one.  O: Def a very enjoyable beer. Bit on the heavy side so its more of a beer i'd drink after a meal or with a good dessert while relaxing.

S- A lot going on here...syrupy sweet notes of caramel, chocolate covered espresso beans, vanilla and wood all mingle endlessly.

Alcohol warmth is definitely apparent...but at 12%, I would expect as much.  M- Slick and smooth up front followed by a dry and woody finish. Moderate carbonation does the job nicely.

Thin 1 finger head that dissipates rather quickly. Had a little bit of lacing.  S - Earthy, nutty, molasses, coffee, oak and booze. Smells reminds me of a bourbon barrel aged porter, not a brown.  T - Same as nose. Mellows as it sits. Booze is very present. Interesting wood / earthy smell which is obviously the Palo Santo wood.  M - Pretty highly carbonated for the style. Dry finish because of the high alcohol. Pretty smooth and well balanced.  Overall - Not my favorite Dogfish brew, but not bad.

A woodiness that I can't quite describe emerges. The alcohol becomes evident as the beer warms and toward the end of the sip. There is a molasses sweetness but it disappears in the thin finish.  M - moderate carbonation and perhaps a touch too much for a beer this big.  O - nothing too special. Had this beer a few times but the taste and alcohol presence doesn't excite my palate.

S- Smells like an intense brown or porter to almost a stout. Lots of sweeter notes and caramel with hints of the woody scent. Slight hint of the high ABV. Very complex and delicious smelling.  T- Starts off like the typical brown ale. Good caramel notes and some brown sugar sweetness. After the initial flavors, a slight alcohol kick comes in, but then the wood flavors kick in. Slightly like oak aged beers, the flavor is complex and sweet. Ends with a slight bite from the wood flavor profile and maybe a few, barely detectable hops.  M- Very light and carbonated for it's ABV and flavor weight, but holds both well. Easy to drink, with only a little alcohol burn. This one could sneak up on you.

Taste: Follows nose, with added smoke, country ham and bacon. Booze and a pinch of bourbon at the end. Nice-but-odd barrel feel all around. Cafe con leche, milk foam.

Poured from the Dark Pink Labeled bottle into my 12oz Surly Darkness Tulip Glass. Has BOTTLED ON: 01/05/2012 on the neck of the bottle.  Aroma- Tons of wood, light toastiness, and chocolate attributes hit the nose first. Very dark background with dark malts, fruits, and other ingredient.  Appearance- Pours a 2 finger, darkest brown head that has average retention. Has a deep brown colored body and leaves VERY thick lacing that coats every inch of the glass.  Flavor- Tons of strong malts and wood are the two biggest noted characters. Has a light caramel flavor and medium-high bitterness at the finish.  Mouthfeel- Full Bodied, Light-Medium Carbonation, Dry, and woody/malt finish on the palate.  Overall Impression- While the drinkability of this one is poor, able to enjoy over a long period of time and really get all the characteristics within.

10099,33832,jwhancher,4.18,"Bought a 4-pack from Total Wine in DE. Bottled on date said 2/2/12. Nice & fresh.  A: Pours a murky black with great tan head at first which then shrinks down to a thin lacing.  S: Big dark malts. Lots of roast at first, but they give away to some sweet caramel notes. Dark fruit of cherry & fig. The wood takes awhile to appear but makes itself know well enough. This one does not smell like a 12% ABV beer at all.  T: Sweet caramel that gives way to a boozy syrupy-sweet dark roasted malt character. Some molasses, vanilla, and some bourbon-like notes. Wood is nice and subtle. The alcohol makes itself known in the taste.  M: This one is well balanced considering the high ABV. A decent kick of bitterness sets in but also lets the sweetness of malts shine through. Feels medium full.  O: One of my favs from DFH. A great nightcap beer or one to sip & enjoy for quite awhile. The wood character is a great behind-the-scenes character.  Update on 3/21/13: had another bottle from the same 4-pack. Bottled on date of 2/2/12. Drinking over 1-year later. Smells more cherry-like, a tad sour, with notes of wood oil, brown sugar & molasses, and pine tar. Has some solventy alcohol. Roast & char seems evident. Tastes like a full, vinous, dark mother of a brew. Competes with any RIS. Still tastes good. Developing interesting complexities, but I wish I had aged this one for at least 2 more years.  Update on 2/11/16: cracked open a bottle from 9/26/13 production date. Tastes great as ever. Excellent beer on a very cold winter night. Some oxidized notes but still very dark, rich, and complex as ever. The palo santo wood notes have melded with the dark malts into a rich dark chocolate like flavor with some wood, vanilla and maybe some spices like nutmeg. Smells non-solventy at room temp.

10099,33832,BeardedRiker,4,"Dogfish Head's Palo Santo Marron is a bit of a mystery to me. I'll have it one time and really enjoy it but another time I won't be so impressed. That's why I'm re-reviewing it, so that I can have a better understanding of this insane brown ale.  Let's be clear. This doesn't look like a normal brown ale at all. It's almost jet black and totally opaque. Anything about it brown? Nope! It looks like you're pouring out oil. The head doesn't form fast or get very high but I made sure my pour was extra disruptive, so my head grew thick, creamy, and brown. By look alone, you'd think you poured out a porter or stout. This is also where you think, ""This is different."" Well, you'd be right about that.  Let's repeat. This doesn't smell like a normal brown ale at all. Sweet molasses, vanilla, strong booze that burns the nostrils, dark fruits, and a spicy uniqueness from the Palo Santo wood give the beer an olfactory complexity. It's very boozy, which is not surprising given its 12% ABV.  If you haven't guess it yet, this doesn't taste like a normal brown ale at all. Up front the booze hits very hard, a little too hard in my opinion. In fact, that's always been my one complaint about the Palo Santo Marron. It has some damn good flavors but the alcohol presence is too strong. The Palo Santo spiciness hits at the front as well, with the rest of the complex beer coming after. Dark fruit (figs) melds with molasses, vanilla, and coffee. Very tasty. Sweetness and roastiness lingers on the tongue.  The mouthfeel is simply luxurious. It's like velvet flowing over the tongue, it's so creamy. Carbonation is medium-low but not flat at all. Sweetness makes the mouth slick. The booze may be like a punch, but the creaminess makes the beer pretty drinkable.  My opinion hasn't changed much with the Palo Santo Marron, but there's no doubt this is a very unique beer, especially since it's classified as a brown ale. The only complaint I have is that I think the booze intrudes on it a bit too much. Still, it's delicious and a beer I'd recommend everyone try at least once.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,brureview,4.53,"Served in a tulip. The beer poured a very dark midnight brown color with a light smell of chocolate. The mouth feel was very tart and tingled the back of the tongue. The finish was a spicy, fruity chocolate, and overpoweringly alcoholic with slight bitterness.  This is a very alcoholic beer-12% ABV- even more than the Boulevard Chocolate Ale. After the beer warms up, there is a smell of fruited chocolate and alcohol in the smell, and the finish also accentuates the alcohol as the chocolate mellows.  Overall, this is a great beer, perhaps my favorite from Dogfish. It's strikingly alcoholic but well balanced with fruit, chocolate and light bitterness.  update: over a year later, 4/18/13, I find more deep cherry and vanilla( aroma)- very pronounced cherry fruit in the taste, and less chocolate. A wonderful beer. Quite intense and a slow sipper. My favorite from Dogfish.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Tastes are boozy up front and tremendously sweet with complex notes of burnt brown sugar, caramel, oak (Palo Santo wood, but it resembles oak), vanilla, and roasted malts. Mouth-feel is creamy, smooth, and boozy enough to leave a peppery prickle on the tongue. Overall, this has always been a favorite of mine. Always love going back to it every once in awhile.

A - Pours a nearly black, dark brown color with a small beige head that dies quickly. Darker than any brown ale I have seen. Some lacing but nothing too impressive.  S - Very complex combination of cherry, vanilla, and coffee beans. Also some oak and toasted malt. Very inviting aroma.  T - Blend of brown sugar, plum, vanilla, espresso, and a little oak (well, probably palo santo wood). There is a mild bitterness and tartness in the middle. Vanilla is especially prominent on the finish. Extremely smooth. The alcohol is well hidden and only becomes the slightest bit apparent as it warms. Very well balanced and complex.  M - Medium bodied with good micro-carbonation. Compliments the flavors nicely and contributes to the equable nature of this beer.  O - I was very impressed by this offering from DFH. The aromas and flavors are a top notch combo of sweet, woody, fruity, and chocolatey. I can't think of another beer with this ABV that goes down quite as smooth as this. It is a bit pricey, but I suppose that is the cost for such a unique, barrel aged brew. Bonus points for the groundbreaking vessels they made to age this brew. I don't give DFH as much credit as they deserve, but they continue to impress me with great beers.

Behind that is some darker fruits and some cherry notes as well. Faint vanilla notes behind the fruits. Impressive that a 12% beer has no alcohol fuselage in the nose.  T - The taste is also incredibly complex. Dark fruit is the first big taste I get in this beer. Some milk and bittersweet chocolates help compliment the sweetness. The slight boozy taste helps cut through all that sweetness and actually balances it out nicely. Finishes just a tad too boozy for my tastes.  M - Thick and chewy bodied. Some moderate alcohol burn going on in it and a moderate level of carbonation.  O - A big and delicious beer.

The mildest hint of alcohol is present, but doesn't smell boozy at all (mildly surprising for 12% beer).  T- Woah, that just punches you in the face. Hold on, let me take another sip. *BAM* ouch, still got me. Sweet caramel malt at first...then a wave of boozy brown beer wallops your senses like you got hit in the face with one of the wooden planks it was brewed with. The booze fades leaving a nice hoppy/slightly bitter finish. I guess for 12% it's what you would expect, but that alcohol really hits you.

10099,33832,jordanblaskey,4.22,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Breckenridge pint glass.  A: Pours deep, dark brown with a gorgeous mocha two finger head that drops down to half an inch and leaves nice lacing.  S: Sweet chocolate notes with a lot of malt backbone. Molasses and slight vanilla are also present.  T: Boozy and woody on the front end, sweet vanilla and molasses in the middle that lead to a pleasant hop-feel bite at the end. A decently complex beer. Glad that the mouth followed the nose.  M: Full bodied and creamy. This is how beer should feel.

10099,33832,ummswimmin,4.4,"Once I picked up a four pack of this while on the Jersey Shore in the summer. This seemed like a good choice since I am a big fan of DFH. Before my review I can that this is one of the worst choices for summer... however, it is one of the better dark beers around.  I poured the Marron into a goblet. There was a thick brown head that came up immediately. This beautiful head comes down to a very nice ring that is good for leaving some nice lacing on the glass. Oh, and it is so dark that absolutely no light comes through.  The flavor is pretty impressive. You get a ton of heavy stout with a pretty significant woody flavor. It actually hits the umami sensor on the tongue. This is the only one that I know accomplishes this. There is also a pretty strong alcohol presence. It is both challenging and complex. Palo Santo is definitely a good choice for sipping. The flavors are so strong that it will overwhelm most beers that follow.  Overall, this is an amazing heavy beer. Don't choose this before going out because you might just want to stay in.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

The wood is prominent and gives an almost spicy aroma. A hint of vanilla in there which balances some of the roast nicely. Mildly spicy with lots of dark sugar notes--molasses, burnt sugar, and caramel. Light vanilla flavor and a subtle roast flavor.

10099,33832,gkunkle,4.13,"Received in a grade with Slvrmon82. Reviewed from notes. Pours a very deep brown, almost black color. Body is the beer is very thick as I can't see much through it. Head is tan, stands 3/4in tall after a fairly aggressive pour. Retention isn't great, but that is to be expected. Smell is of sweet caramel malt, vanilla, roasted malts. Taste is relatively comples, from the malts I get a nice smooth sweetness. I also get some dark fruit, vanilla, woody flavors. I can taste just a hint of alcohol, but wouldn't have guessed that this was 12%. Body is thick, with subtle carbonation, this is an enjoyable beer, pretty drinkable considering how big it is.

10099,33832,loftisCT,4.14,"Bottled 10/04/11, Enjoyed 02/01/12 A: This thing is jet black. Even when I held it up to the light I couldn't see any lighter color around the edges of the glass. The head is brown but doesn't stay around as long as expected, maybe the alcohol is the culprit. S: Awesome smell. The two main players to me are fruitiness and vanilla. Fruit is of the estery, cherry like variety. I swear I can smell a really sweet banana, like banana cream pie but I might be crazy. The vanilla is no surprise given the wood, but surprisingly, any other wood characteristics are pretty subtle. I don't know what palo santo wood swells like, but I don't think I can really smell any woodiness, with the exception of the vanilla. A roasty, dry, maltiness lurks beneath to really bring the aroma together. T: Fruitiness and sweeter malts open up the taste. The bottle says caramel but I'm not really picking much up. The estery fruitiness is really pleasant, typical DFH great fermentation, and carries the taste on top of the apparent maltiness. The vanilla is also present. The beer slowly dries out as a roasty bitterness and the alcohol take over. It’s a nice transition, the fruitiness never disappears, but joins the roastiness and the alcohol in a lingering finish. The finish is relatively dry, but is somewhat refreshing, surprising given the ABV. M: Really nice mouthfeel here. Fuller side of medium-bodied. The sweetness and bitterness combo do a great job working over the entire palette. O: Typical DFH beer. They stress the uniquie, crazy Palo Santo wood but it really only adds a nice complexity to a well-crafted, balanced beer. The alcohol is a little too present for me, but I still really enjoyed this beer. I feel like I drank this beer a little green, and it will only improve with age.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,Pintofbrown,4.05,"I had this offering in a nonic pint. Big thanks to Geneseohawk for this one!  Appearance- The milk - chocolate colored frothy and creamy - smooth head has decent retention, but falls to a ring with only the tiniest bit of lace on the glass.  An opaque and nearly black body is also stunning on this ""brown"" ale.  Smell- A wood chip scent is dominant, that almost turns smokey the more sniffs I take from the glass. Booze is also appreciated, with that woodiness it begins to smell like a whiskey.  A sweet syrupy quality also rises out of the glass. It is a little caramel and vanilla in quality. That sweet and smokey combo also gives the impression of figs.  Taste- A sweet brown sugar and roasted malt come through first, followed in short order by the now bourbon-like booze. A little oakiness shows and mingles with some earthy flavors and more roasted malt in the finish.  This is not nearly as sweet as the nose, but the bourbon aspect and oakiness are well appreciated.  Mouth feel- I really enjoy the medium body and the slickness of this beer. The high alcohol really suits that kind of feel. Too creamy and I think it would be harder to drink.  Overall- While certainly not shy on the booziness, there is much to like. The fun and complex nose, the brown sugar and bourbon qualities of the palate, and the solid, slick feel.  I would gladly have this again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

La Brea tar pits in color and a thin brown head, but it oddly looks tempting. ""Drink me."", it says. ""There's a sabre toothed tiger skeleton at the bottom."" Now that's black. None more black.  Oh yeah, the booze. Ethanol in abundance, but the thick, syrupy tongue coating seems to mute the alcohol. The mouthfeel mingles with the vanilla/booze cabal perfectly.  I've helped you none in describing this beer, but I did my best. I am still confused, perplexed and delighted by this beer. I will add that cellaring seems to have little effect on the beer.

10099,33832,Jugs_McGhee,3.36,"Another Dogfish head beer. Hmm. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle with botled on date 02/02/2011B. What does the B mean? I don't know. Served into a De Molen beer stemflute in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. I don't know what to expect, but when I think of a brown think nuts. Wood aging isn't anywhere near what I'd expect, and I'm hoping it'll blow me away. Served slightly warmer than refrigerator cold.  A: Pours a 1.5 finger head of rich light tan colour, good cream, great thickness, and very impressive retention - especially considering the 12.00% ABV. Wow. Colour is a solid black (NOT brown). I'm impressed so far, and excited to try it.  Sm: A moderately strong aroma of cream, wood, nuts, birch, vanilla, caramel, and a hint of alcohol. I wouldn't call it subtle, nor is it particularly inviting. No yeast comes through.  T: The wood comes through, but only on the finish. The warm alcohol is well-restrained and hidden, hardly coming through at all. I get vanilla, light caramel, very buried roasted barley (why this is buried is beyond me), and nuts - but only on the climax. It isn't subtle, but instead feels muted; I find myself straining to taste each note because the holistic flavour doesn't have all that much to offer. I mean it's good, and it's balanced, but it just doesn't bring the depth or boldness I'd expect from a 12% beer. This may be the least flavorful high ABV beer I've had in the last three months.  Mf: Smooth and wet, suiting the flavours and general tone of the beer. Not too thick nor too thin. Actually surprisingly well done.  Dr: Extremely drinkable for the ABV, but where is the flavour? Hit us with the taste if you believe it's a good one! I like this, but I wouldn't have it again because it's kind of a panzy when it comes to delivering on the promise of the aroma.

T- The wood-aging is very evident in the taste. I also get hints of caramel, vanilla, and chocolate. The alcohol warming sensation is still strong, even after 3.5 years. Very malty finish.

The alcohol is very prevalent in the aftertaste. I was surprised by the alcohol flavor until I saw that this was a 12% ABV beer!  M - Thick and velvety. Carbonation is very low.

I can sense the alcohol already!  Taste rich and spicy coffee, caramel, and molasses matching the aroma almost perfectly. Eclectic and powerful malt flavor. Aftertaste of bitter biting hops that linger on the back palatte.  Mouthfeel heavy, creamy, smooth.  Drinkibility is inhibited by the heavy body and rich flavor not to mention a 12% ABV. This is definitely a desert beer -- leave room and only apply after a light fare!  Overall, this is a very fine brown ale or perhaps more appropriately akin to a rich stout.

Smell: A vanilla smell from the wooden barrel and earthy tones with light caramel notes.  Taste: The vanilla makes an appearance as do the toasted and roasted malt notes along with a strong caramel malt note. The hops provide a slight undercurrent to everything else alongside the alcohol that gives it a bit of sweetness but turns towards the finish.  Mouthfeel: The beer is thick and creamy with no carbonation. The beer also feels a little oily and the alcohol gives a little burn in the finish.  Overall: A fairly good and pretty strong beer.

It was alot milder than I was expecting...

When dissipates it leaves a nice thick lacing.  S: wood scent is very prominent scent. Also can smell caramel roasted malts, I believe also a bit of chocolatey malts as well. Can smell the booze too, fairly strong. The more it warms up, it brings out a cherry aroma.  T: amazing, many layers of flavor. Starts off very sweet caramel flavor, then develops into more of a roasted flavor bringing out the flavor of the wood heavily. Finally, finishes slightly bitter. You can obviously taste the booze due to the abv but it is very well hidden. When it warms up, there is also a cherry flavor at the end of the beer.  M: very thick and creamy, coasts the palate very well, leaves with a slight tingle.  Overall, I wasnt sure how this would be going into it due to the abv.

Light brown head quickly dissipated to just a collar  Taste - Smooth vanilla and woody characterisitics but no real hop component. Good malt base. This is a delicious beer that suspect didn't taste this good fresh. A little sweet flavor from the alcohol at the front of the profile but no other hint of the 12% ABV.

10099,33832,jhtipton,4.18,Thanks to Donnie BB on the trade. Pours a gooey thick vicious black into my chalice. Darkest brown ale on earth? Very small head with minor lacing. Smell is not the most prominent feature of this ale but the taste is great. Nice and woody and malty flavor with sweetness like maple or honey smoothing the throat. Very nice mouthfeel. Very thick like eating a meal. Overall a great version of brown ale but don't try to session this. Two beers is like polishing off a bottle of wine on your own.

It is listed as a brown ale, but I find similarities with this and some Russian Imperials....see Clown Shoes.  Tis has been in the rotation for over 2 years. It has a very dark brown...almost black quality with a very weak head. Carbonation is also not optimal.  SP has a very exotic smell and the taste is unlike the vast majority of strong ales.

10099,33832,bamadog,4.22,"For some reason I thought I had this beer before, but I guess I was wrong. No better way to make up for that mistake than correcting the problem. Review is from notes taken on 12/11/2011 and poured from the bottle to a snifter.  Appearance: Wow. This is an American Brown? Ha. I know the styles are only guidelines, but this one starts out by showing that DFH will not be bound by them. Pour is thick looking, like motor oil and it's nearly black; starts with a short 1/4 finger dark tan head that fades to a faint wisp with a thick, creamy ring around the surface; body is entirely opaque;  Smell: Smell is quite big and robust and very woody -- the wood stands out so much that it reminds me of cracking a Cigar City beer that has been aged on cedar -- this wood is obviously different, but it's more about the strength; beneath the wood is a bit of an earthy nuttiness, some dark and sweet fruit (perhaps cherry?)  Taste: Excellent. A lot going on here -- the wood is of course present, but it's very well blended with a lot of other flavor profiles -- a definite presence of dark and slightly tart cherries; strong coffee roastiness with a touch of bittersweet chocolate; I would almost swear that there is a touch of vanilla in there as well -- kind of like the syrup in a chocolate covered cherry; alcohol is definitely present, but at 12%, it's to be expected and it just adds to the great set of flavors.  Mouthfeel: Body is of medium/heavy weight and the carbonation is still present and tingly, but the alcohol helps it out as well and keeps the mouth prickly and warm from the vaporous booziness; a thick, sticky and chewy coating is left on the palate and there is a certain grittiness that is left on the teeth; belly is left quite warm.  Overall: I can't believe I've gone this long without picking this beer up; I will definitely be getting some more to throw in the closet to see how it continues to do with some time on it. Due to the high ABV, I feel that it has to be a little bit lower, but this beer is like a meal unto itself -- a fine desert beer that would probably good paired with a rich chocolate cake, or maybe even some vanilla ice cream to offset it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,jmarsh123,4.05,"Pours a deep brown with no head and some spotty lacing/coating down the glass.  Aroma is very boozy with some sweet malts, molasses and wood character.  Starts off with a molasses sweetness. Some good earthy woody flavor lingers on the palate as it finishes both slightly bitter and sweet. A little bit of booze, but it's hidden well for an ABV of this size.  Smooth and velvety with low carbonation.  Amazing smooth ale and the last of my stash since DFH stopped distributing here.

10099,33832,tobelerone,4,"Wow, what an unusual oddball of a beer. Leave it to Dogfish Head to dream this kind of stuff up.  Dark brown color, good fluffy brown head that settles down fairly quickly. Decent lace remains.  Aroma is strongly woody, with fruity, malty sweetness and a touch of booze underneath.  Flavor is once again dominated by the wood; tastes like drinking a woodworking shop...in a good way? I liked it so I suppose so. Very little in the way of hops or bitterness; moderate sweetness, alcohol is fairly well concealed for such a powerful brew. There’s a whiskey-like undercurrent here, and hints of vanilla, caramel, char, roast coffee.  Medium bodied and creamy, with modest carbonation. A little sticky with a briefly lingering aftertaste of wood and molasses.  A really interesting beer.

Appearance- At first glance, a very dark color, dark brown with a very fluffy head, great appearance, served in a tulip glass at the Alehouse.  Smell- Tons of different smells in the nose on this one, I really noticed a coffee smell, some caramel notes, and a hint of a wood type smell.  Taste- Very strong wood taste, usually a fan of wood flavors but in this case it was not good, I felt that the alcohol was very overpowering along with the wood flavor, and only got hints of the roast flavor and coffee flavor.  Mouthfeel- Very smooth and good in the mouth.  Overall- Great in every aspect except I felt that the alcohol was too overpowering, I believe that if I had it in a bottle or maybe aged a bit, it would be a lot better of a beer.

10099,33832,LeoPanna,4.23,"!2oz bottle...bottled on November 7, 2011.. ""Malt Beverage aged on Palo Santo Wood""  A: Poured into a tulip... Root beer brown with a thick 2-finger coffee head, sturdy as gelatin... no change in color when held directly under the light...I love dark beers with coffee color heads, it means one thing to me: FLAVOR.  S: Coffee, Chocolate, dark Malts, a little whiskey, a little wood. Caramel... The bottle says vanilla, but I don't smell it, I'm sure it's in the taste... smells like an imperial stout...after 30 minutes, I can smell some cherry, vanilla...  T: First thing I think of is wood. That's the Palo Santo. Next taste is sweet malt whiskey. Then some mild vanilla bean. I don't get any of the nuttiness that I find in other brown ales. It's extremely strong on alcohol, 12%, and it doesn't hide it. I wish there wasn't as much alcohol so I can taste some of the other flavors better... after about 30 minutes the flavors start to emerge a bit more. I smell and taste black cherry, the alcohol isn't as strong (probably getting used to it). It definitely gets better as it goes along.  MF: Thick and creamy with light carbonation. Not oily like a stout, but thicker than the average brown ale. Considering the alcohol level, it goes down incredibly smooth. No complaints here.  O: I'm not exactly blown away by the taste, but everything works great. It gets better as it goes along. The uniqueness of the wood comes into play over time. Dogfish Head never disappoints. They've set the bar really high with other brews so it's hard to give this a 5 or 4.5 overall, but I really enjoyed it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,KickInTheChalice,4.03,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a DFH signature glass.  Appearance: While it was pouring out of the bottle I could tell that this was going to be a thick and viscous beer. The color is a mahogany or ebony, nearly black with almost no light getting through. A dark tan cap rests on top of the beer and retains very nicely for a beer of this ABV.  Smell: The aroma is full and deep, but it is not overly complex of out of. The roasted malt gives off caramel, burnt brown sugar, roasted grains, cocoa, and a bit of alcohol.  Taste: The flavor starts with a combination of caramel and burnt brown sugar, twisting the sweetness in a different direction. Toasted grains and cocoa come through next. A bit of vanilla precedes the nice dry woody flavor toward the end. A little bit different than oak, this must be the influence of the Palo Santo wood. Just a bit of booze peaks through toward the end. The finish is lightly sweet and a little woody at the same time.  Mouthfeel: There is no doubt about the fullness of this body. Slightly sticky, with a bit of oily residue after each sip; both of these sensations are quite common for big ABV beers, so no lost points there. The carbonation is creamy and contributes to the smoothness, although it is a bit understated.  Overall: I thought this was another good take on the American Brown style from Dogfish Head. Indian Brown is a better beer, in my opinion, but there are not a lot of 12% brown ales out there. It's definitely a compliment that Sam can brew a big, tasty beer in a category that normally sees more mild releases.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Shagtastic,3.78,"Poured from a bottle into my tulip  A: Wow this puppy is dark. When poured into a tulip glass this beer has a very small head that actually holds for quite awhile before receding. When looking at the color it has more of the appearance of a stout than a brown, big points in that respect from me.  S: This is a very complex beer on the smell. I'm getting a lot of the wood coming through first followed by a few other smells. One big one is vanilla. Overall its pretty pleasant.  T: Ok this is a mammoth of a beer. I've had quite a few brews in my day and when it comes to browns this is by far and away the biggest. The wood comes through huuuge and wont slow down. I get bits of vanilla and a hint of cherry along the way as well. My biggest knock on this is that the alcohol is not masked at all and still comes through strong.  M: Palo Santo's carbonation is great even awhile after popping the cap. The drinkability isn't too high because of how boozy it is. Given time this beer could age well and merry up into a much more drinkable beer.  Overall: This was an interesting beer to make my first review. I debated going small and doing a gateway beer for those readers who haven't had the experience that I have... but then I said screw it. Go big or go home! This isn't a beer for beginners so if you aren't sure about it then I'd avoid it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,TheAlamoWrocker,3.16,"Reviewed November 19, 2011. Poured a 12 oz bottle, bottled on 10/04/11, into a JFF is my BFF novelty Pint glass.  A: This is easily one of the blackest beers I have ever seen. There is hardly any reddening even on the edges, if anything the glass has to hit the light right for you to even see it. The head was hardly there and what was there dissipated quite quickly with the only head there for lacing, which slides down sadly.  S: Coffee is the main hitter here followed by a chocolate. The alcohol is definitely present.  T: What I taste is some slight wood, but then it had a sharp alcohol taste the rest of the way. It taste as if it was vodka without any burn. As I desire to let this drink get its full taste out there I'm gonna let it sit for a bit. When this drink warms, 10-20 minutes, up it becomes cough syrup, why? 20-40, this still taste like cough syrup. 45-1 hour plus, the best this gets is an extremely alcoholic coffee. At least 3+ hours after being poured and at now complete room temperature the taste as I could only assume reached what it was meant to be. The Palo Santo wood, similar to an Oak, has made it's strong appearance and the sweetness of a molasses adds to this wooden flavor. The alcohol taste is not as rough as it was before, but almost sticks to the Palo Santo wood. The aftertaste is best described as a thin molasses. The coating that it leaves on the mouth is still sadly reminiscent of cough syrup though.  M: Feels thick and syrupy, reminds me of cough syrup all over again. The carbonation is moderate. As this warms up it becomes less thick and much more decent.  O: This is simply a drink that I needed to be warned that it should be drank at completely room temperature. I have no problem enjoying a drink at room temperature, but please throw it on the label. After many hours it finally became decent to me, different but nice nonetheless.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,McStagger,4.37,"The Legend...  A: Brown is a bit of a misnomer. Pours fairly black. Head disappoints. Tawny color of one finger. Head is slightly fuzzier than anticipated. Seriously, this is as black as any stout I have encountered.  S: Carmeled sugar, mocha, leather, toffee.  T: This...is one strange brew. While everything I read screams American brown, I can't help but think imperial porter...or not. Definitely a beer that defies easy categorization. Dark fruit, the same thick toffee, a bit of coffee bitterness, burnt sugar...coffee creme anglaise is a flavor I have had recently that does it justice. But with a bit more of a dried darkened fruit flavor added to the mix. Definitely complex, definitely flavorful. The alcohol, while adding to the roundness of the fruit and sweet notes, doesn't bring in the ""heat"" that can sometimes be experienced with beers in this abv range. And the finish. Wow. I've sampled a first growth Bordeaux that didn't have a finish as long as this.  M: fairly still for a beer. Thick, viscous, incredible dense. Not a beer for anything other than savoring. This is my first sampling of Dogfish Head and I am not at all disappointed. Worth the hype.

S: Very interesting aroma, smells like chocolate, wood, spices  T: Chocolate, wood, dark fruits and a bit of roastiness combine for something a little different. I've had this beer several times before and this particular one doesn't taste as woody as past beers. It's sweet, but not overpoweringly so, and it really hides its big ABV well.  M: Medium-bodied with nice carbonation.  O: Honestly, I've never really understood the obsession with Dogfish Head, most of their beers are mediocre at best, but this is the one beer of theirs' that I get excited about. It's very unique, bringing qualities of a sweeter imperial stout and stuffing them into a brown ale's body and then aging it on a unique wood that gives it a great flavor.

S: Incredibly complex! Initial notes of vanilla, whiskey, chocolate, all are apparent. The booze is prevalent.  T: This is where it is obvious that this is not a stout but a brown ale. There is no bitterness or burn quality in the taste. Vanilla and wood notes stand out most notably. The alcohol isn't as noticeable as one would think, however, there is a slight numbing of the tongue and warming in the belly.

I have no idea if i should be rating the appearance on brown ale standards or on its own. It looks like no brown ale i have seen more like a stout, as state. About a half fingers worth of khaki head that disappears quickly. decent alcohol legs, expected at 12%  Smell - Warm vanilla right up front followed by a light hint of oak, very subtle which is surprising. As it warms up you get more of the woodiness.  Taste - Dark fruits right up front, especially dark cherries, raisons and figs. A very sweet beer and the wood characteristics do not shine through as much as i would hope. I might add this is a relatively fresh bottle too. Just like the smell, the taste opens up a lot more as it warms. A nice vanilla oak character in the back of the tongue which is very nice.

Overall - This is one of my favorite Dogfish Head beers, not only is it pretty widely available but it is one of the best they brew. This is the kind of innovation you would expect from them but nothing over the top like other things they have done. That being said i had no idea how to review this one, it deserves a category all of its own, definitely not a brown ale.

Dark tan head comes in at just under a finger. No lacing to speak of.  Smells of a blend of booze, spiced caramel, and burning brown sugar. Well projected, even more so as it warms.  Tastes of a sweet, thick blend of black molasses, hints of caramel, brown sugar and a woodiness that is difficult to describe. Incredibly heavy and rich, it achieves a layering flavor and an intense finish that are very difficult to find similarly from other producers. This feels like a world-class Dogfish Head.  While not a dessert beer per-say, there are obvious connections between this and the World Wide Stout. Rich, heavy, and intensely flavorful, malty and dirty.

A: Pours very dark, with no head while being poured. After it finishes pouring it has a small head that doesn't last very long.  S: Slight smell of caramel, but the smell was not very strong. Was expecting it to be more aromatic for how dark it was.  T: The first taste is very earthy. After it sits on the tongue a bit there is a bitter coffee taste to it that, and maybe a hint of dark chocolate.  M: Low carbonation and the beer feels quite oily. It clings to the mouth, but not in an unpleasant way. The feeling of lingers for about a minute.  O: I enjoyed it, but I don't think it was worth the price I paid for if I'm just enjoying the flavor.

Look: Dark as night with hints of rose on the edges, and a rocky pink-brown head. finger-and-a-half of head that laced and retained well until the last quarter, where the carbonation simply gave out.  Smell: Rosehip and alcohol, smoke, and vanilla; it’s rather wine-like, but with a very prominent, nearly bourbonesque bite. Very slight oak, but most aroma complexities are hidden by that alcohol. 12% will often do that to a beer.  Taste: Vanilla and tobacco compete, almost with no avail, against the alcohol bite, which absolutely dominates. A light rosehip and clove flavor lurks. The beer becomes creamier as it wanders on the tongue, the oak emerges in full form, and the deeper flavors are able to come out. It is complex, though unbalanced in the alcohol’s dominance. It’s certainly not a casual sipper; this begs to be held on the palate before the balance even thinks about showing itself. I would like to see those balanced flavors come out sooner on the nose and beginning of the sip.  Mouthfeel: Very light for such a dark beer; this really floats easily around the tongue. No stickiness to speak of, and the  Overall: Very complex; its wine nose is followed by a very sharp biting first sip that manages to evolve to creamy when held on the palate. Fairly well done. While it is the most complex Dogfish Head beer I’ve tasted, the balance leaves a lot to be desired.

It has a one finger, thick and creamy, mocha-colored head with great retention, but leaves no lacing.  S: The smell is a very complex onslaught of aromas. Nutty maltiness and earthy overtones are the backbone. Sweet vanilla, a woodiness scent, and dark fruits contribute their aromatic qualities in beautiful harmony. A light touch of alcohol at the end provides a slight sting.  T: The taste is along the same lines as the smell with a similar complexity. Again the nutty and earthy tones are present with the subtleties of vanilla, dark fruits, and roasted malts. I'm not catching the woodiness in the taste nor can I tell at all that this has such a high ABV.  M: This has a perfect medium body that could easily pass for a good stout. There is a light carbonation present, but in spite of this, it has a smooth velvety feel. The alcohol once again makes it's presence known, though only slightly, with a small alcoholic warming sensation.  O: This is certainly one of the best brown ales around in my opinion.

Brown sugar, figs and is that teriyaki? Very interesting stuff. It pours black with mild carbonation which fades quickly. It looks like an imperial stout  I love the taste. It reminds me almost of a Belgian dubbel or quad. Very sweet, little bit of smoke and oak. It's delicious. At 12%, it is a bit boozy, but nothing overwhelming. It certainly isn't hot.

The head slowly receded into a thin film. Got some lacing...  The aroma is very sweet... dark chocolate, cocoa, molasses, some great woody aromas, possibly a little vanilla from the wood and definitely some sweet boozy notes.  Taste follows the nose. Sweet dark fruits, bitter dark chocolate, vanilla, wood, molasses and cocoa all blend together perfectly. Very complex and delicious  Medium bodied. Very boozy with some serious heat but it is VERY welcomed. Semi sweet drying aftertaste. Definitely coats the tongue with each sip and leaves some residual heat.

10099,33832,Ryan011235,4.41,"Growler poured into a Stella Artois glass on 8/15/11  I'm rating this as an American Strong Ale; seems more appropriate that way.  Pours so dark a brown, it's nearly black. Settles jet black. One finger head thins to a half covering of bubbles. There are some haphazardly strewn blots of lace.  Deep aromas - damp wood and hints of vanilla sit over top sugary malts: molasses, brown sugar, unsweetened dark chocolate and cocoa. Rich and full without being a sugar bomb. Very smooth. Earthy and nutty. I can tell the abv is high, but it doesn't smell hot, considering. Slightly herbal after a few swirls of the glass. Aromas of natural peanut butter and musty bark as it warms.  Palo Santo Marron tastes as complex as it smells. The alcohol is a bit more apparent and the flavors are far sweeter, too. Roasted dark malts, chocolate and a faint spot of coffee. Lots of near-burnt sugars, especially molasses. Wood tones are mild, seemingly buried in the sugars. Nutty overtones. Nips of spice on the finish. Perhaps some stray dark fruit notions low in the mix.  Full bodied; smooth and viscous enough to be a proper stout. Despite a modest, rolling carbonation there is an overall silky feel. A bit of alcohol slickness on the back end. Flavor residuals are massive and linger long.  I've been a fan of Palo Santo Marron ever since I had it on tap in Portland in 2008. It's easily my favorite DFH beer. I reviewed a bottle in 2009 but at the time I didn't feel I did it justice so I scrapped it.

10099,33832,nhindian,4.08,"12oz bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass.  Bottled on 11/11/09  A - Pours a dark dark, oak brown, almost essentially black. A creamy, mocha-colored, 1.5-fingered head slowly builds and lasts for a good amount of time. Lots of carbonation streaming up the side of the glass and leaving patches. Lacing is fantastic given the size of this beer, with an almost entire coating covering the edges.  S - On first sniff, I'm getting a ton of roast, nearly boardering on smokey, with a hefty amount of caramel, vanilla, and brown sugar. Definitely getting the wood qualities from the Palo Santo tank. Some molasses and sticky tobacco. Quite complex and deep.  T - The flavors deliver a malt profile that is nearly unrivaled in a brown ale. The first time I had this was almost a year ago, and since then I've run the spectrum of different styles and breweries interpretation of them, and this still stands out as very unique and flavorful. There's a bit of soy or smoke, but it's mild and is quickly disposed as the wood and malts take over. Brown sugar, molasses, caramel for sure. Good amount of wood, and lots of vanilla. A slight alcohol heat comes across in the finish.  M - outhfeel is medium-bodied with good carbonation. Full-bodied, smooth, and creamy, with a sweet aftertaste. Long lasting sweetness and roast.  D/O - Drinkability is high. I think this has held up pretty well both in the way it developed in the bottle and my expectations and memory of it. It's a bit sweeter than I remember, I'm not sure if it was like that the first time I had it or if the two years of age brought it out a bit. Still, insanely drinkable for 12%, a bit of alcohol heat but if anything, it's the sweetness that would be the limiting factor for this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Hops are there as well.  M - Moderate to heavy body, but lightened by a zing of hops bitterness and tingly carbonation. Very smooth. Alcohol is definitely there but blends with other elements.

Smells like a coffee stout, with a hint of sweetness that youd expect from a bourbon barrel. a strong alcohol flavor kind of meanders into the party, but not too much.  The taste is something amazing. The initial taste has the multitude of flavors that kind of seems like a blitzkrieg by about 7 different armies. i get hints of vanilla and an oaky smoothness I would associate with bourbon barrel aging. There is a solvent alcohol that somehow actually fits in somehow. It comes along with a bitter coffee/dark chocolate flavor, and my god the go well together. The woody flavors kind of just sit on the sides of your tongue while the black coffee flavors cling to the roof of your mouth.  Holy lord this is one complex beer.

10099,33832,BarryMFBurton,4.29,"There was definitely some luck behind getting this bottle – I feel like I got the last one left in Indianapolis. At any rate, I’m glad to be sampling it now. I love Dogfish Head, so I know I’ll probably enjoy this one, but I’ve also seen a couple behind-the-scenes videos about the brewing of this specific beer. Cracking this one is even more special now that I’ve had the opportunity to see what the brewery went through to get it made (and trust me, it was quite a lot). To passionate brewers!  Brewed more than two years before the date of this tasting (“BOTTLED ON: 05/27/09”).  A: An interesting pour; the body, an incredibly dark brown, flows slowly from the bottle. I’m waiting for a big head to form, but I’m disappointed – there’s hardly any foam appearing. A carefree stream of brownish film floats lazily along the top of the body, never stopping in one place to really expand. Thus, it’s sitting at paper thinness for the duration. As the glass is twirled, a smooth, mild carbonation shows its beautiful self, prompting some lacing after I tip to drink. I wish the fizz showed itself without so much effort on my part – it looks great. Overall, it’s not the usual presence a beer like this puts off, but not bad, either.  S: Caramel malts, chocolate, sticky vanilla marshmallow, and bourbony booze start this nose with lovely depth and delight. New leather, roasted barley, and very light fruits are beneath, as well. The spice of ginger and cinnamon lingers late among the aromas, as does the earthy smoothness of cedar sawdust and tobacco. Very complex, and quite intriguing – the woody scent at the end is especially fascinating (I’m guessing it’s the Palo Santo).  T: Exquisite. Smooth caramel cream and a throwdown from the sugary malts meet your tongue head-on as soon as you take a sip. It’s the nose, amplified: I’m getting lemon zest, vanilla, toffee, a mild coffee/roast flavor, smoky tobacco, white pepper, and even some flowery hops on the back end. Bitter, slightly, but just enough to counteract the sweets. Then, the wood tastes arrive – and boy, are they the highlight of this palate. Earthy, smooth, and incredible, they give you the same warm feeling you get when you walk into a wood shop and get that instantly recognizable bouquet in your nose. This is what so many beers are missing when they go for something barrel-aged; instead of a brandy-infused monster, this beer has that subtle taste of fresh-cut wood, so smooth and satisfying. I love what they’ve done with it. The aftertaste is thick, malty, and a little bit hoppy (though mostly in a bitter grain sense), which, though it sounds nice, strikes me as unfittingly sharp at times. It certainly doesn’t stop me from taking another sip, though – this stuff is delicious!  M: Thickness is appropriate for a dark, woody beer like this. However, this flows rather quickly over the tongue, showcasing a very fluid nature, instead. Still satisfying all around, though. Carb is medium, at most.  O: This is one hell of a beer; it really is. I wasn’t quite expecting it, but the wood aging makes a huge difference. It’s right up there with World Wide Stout and Raison D’extra as my favorite DFH beers. Plus, for some reason, this has given me more motivation to homebrew than I’ve ever had; I guess it’s just because I’ve seen the brewing process for this beer, and tasted how awesome the result was.

T: Very sweet malt is the primary thing that hits you, but it's not as harsh to me as some imperial stouts and porters I've had (which it resembles in appearance). There are lingering burnt notes and a background of vanilla, but the finish is somewhat spoiled by the burn and taste of the alcohol.  M: Initially very smooth with a light carbonation.

10099,33832,lurpy1,4.42,"One of many very spendy offerings from DFH. Let's see if the product justifies the cost.  Outstanding smell, very woody with a substantial booze backing. Caramelly smell too, reminiscent of scotch ales. Very unusual and very appealing.  Taste is similar, the wood aging comes at you in droves. So this is what Paraguay smells like. Again, the alcohol is no wallflower here. Really a novel take on the style. A bit of alcohol burn, but still a tremendous drinking experience.  This is a real category-buster, I found this differentiated from other brown ales and superior to most of them. At the price, it will be a while before I try it again, but really, it's worth it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,azorie,4.6,"Seen these and I thought 12% abv wtf not, I need a nice buzz.  A: I poured at 45f into a mug. With a nice hard pour got about 1/2 inch of foam. Some nice brown lacing than was dark tan. Beer is very dark its like RIS dark. Not sure its too style if you ask me.  S: wow wood, sweet malt very earthy. You get some tannins, maybe vanilla, maybe something fruit like. I cannot tell still weird stuff. No hops detected.  T: ok the rubber meets the road here, while its not to style who cares, this is 1 complex and delightful brew. Strong red wine like, vanilla, oak, burnt dark chocolate, cocoa bean coffee. No booze, its all very balanced. no hops detected, I assume its because its aged ion wood? great beer, rare find, love this beer.  M: thick and rick and all that, smooth, low carb  O: ok the style is BS, but who cares, I love it.  M - It is smooth, so smooth. Probably from sitting on wood. It is slightly viscous, but not too sticky. It is very creamy in the mouth. After swallowing that slight sweet residue left over helps prevent the high alcohol content from drying the palate out too much. Bordering on perfection.  O - One of my favorite beers. Everything about it is near flawless. The only issue I have with it is being labeled a brown ale. I don't think it follows the style.

It was something like $4.00, which in hindsight was a steal. I think it is time for a proper review.  A - Poured into a bordeaux wine glass. It was very, very dark and thick like an imperial russian stout does. Why is this labeled a brown ale? A little head, but what is there stays there and leaves lacing behind on the glass.  S - It smells of smokey cherry with a hint of vanilla.  T - Takes sweet like a chocolate covered cherry and has a lingering vanilla like finish. Has bakers chocolate and coffee-like bitter notes throughout, but the bitterness is low. Such a complex flavor without over doing it. Amazing.  M - It is smooth, so smooth.

10099,33832,Celtics76,4,"I decided to give this a try after storing it for a year. I am not a fan of Brown Ales, but it's Dogfish Head so why not.  This beer looks great and smells even better. As for taste, initially it felt like I was drinking pure alcohol. Just one sip and you know it's north of 10% ABV. A few of sips in, some strong flavors began to rise to the surface. Very malty with a hint of brown sugar is the best way to describe it.  This is obviously not a traditional brown ale along the lines of Samuel Smith, but it is very unique, flavorful and worth the high price once in a while.

Appearance: Pours almost black with some red at the edges where the light comes through. There is a half finger of tan head that fades quickly.  Smell: Sweet, which isn't surprising. Dark fruit and brown sugar notes. Mild roast and a hint of wood. Some alcohol as well.  Taste: Extremely smooth given the abv. Not very sweet, but there are hints of dark fruit and chocolate. The palo santo wood adds some complexity. The finish is still a bit hot even with a year on it.  Mouthfeel: The body is on the thick side of medium body. The carbonation is fluffy and smooth. The finish is mildly slick.  Overall: The fact that this isn't overly sweet really surprised me. I thought it was complex and very interesting.

Single 12 oz bottle, just to try, from the Beer Junction in West Seattle. Poured into pint glass.  Pours a nice, mocha, 1"" head that sticks around a while, with frothy, heavier lacing. Body poured a dark brown coffee color to become virtually opaque in glass. Absolutely no light penetrates this beer.  Smells of smoky, chocolatly malt and old, soaked oak, quite boozy. Cherry and almost brown sugar aroma.  Damn malty, very herbal hops, again, smoky, and something here is a tad spicy. Sort of a dark chocolate texture and taste.  Clean and delightful on-bringing comes to a staunch and high alchol content feel aftertaste that tastes like rubber. Alcohol lingers in all four corners of the mouth, worse than but comparable to a dry wine.  If you like smoky and or spice-like, wine-like beers, this bud's for you.

10099,33832,VelvetExtract,3.75,"A-Pours nearly stout-like. Blackest brown. Slight head. Head is tan and is barely alive.  S-Rich, deep, sweet aroma. A bunch of vanilla. The vanilla is backed by a blatant wooden scent. Brown sugar comes out too. Alcohol makes a big appearance in the nose. The wood really makes this an interesting smelling beer.  T-First taste is pretty bold. Bark covered vanilla bean flavor. Bunches of dark maltiness. Taste is overpowering at first. In the middle an unripened dark fruit flavor sets it and is pleasant. Lost going on here.  M-Heavy bodied. Carbonation is slight. Slick, viscous feel. Alcohol dries the tongue to a dried coral state.  O/D-I have been putting this off due to the fact that I a) do not like much from Dogfish Head besides 60 Minute IPA, and b) Its about $16 dollars for a four-pack of this. When I saw it on tap I knew I needed to try it out. Cool beer. Not the right time of year, and a bit too alcohol ridden for my taste. Most Dogfish brews leave me tongue awkwardly too dried up from the booze; this one is no different. Good but not exceptional in my worthless opinion.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Out of the bottle comes a very dark, murky brown that, once in the glass looks more like an opaque black. Very little tan/brown head developed, and what did appear dissipated back to a ring of bubbles very quickly. Smells of light woods (cedar, pine), alcohol, dark fruits, cane sugar, caramel, and faint vanilla. Tastes of the aforementioned woods, caramel, vanilla, sugar, date, plum, and a touch of grape. Not any kind of sour grape, just a faint red grape flavor. It’s balanced quite well, with only a subtle alcohol presence in the very end. Mouthfeel is great, with the carbonation cutting through the otherwise viscous fluid. I was surprised to notice the carbonation after watching such little head development in the beginning. Overall, a delicious brew that I regret not having more regular access to.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Layer upon layer of wood overtones, both rich and tannic in nature. A slightly syrupy sweetness rounds out the back end. Mouthwatering finish, deep purple grape skin tartness.  M: Thick, coating...though slightly over carbed for the flavor profile.  O: Excellent sipper, but never gets bogged down. Drinkability is good.

No head, and no lacing, but mysterious to behold.  S: Rich, powerful, enticing. Notes of dried dark fruit: cranberries, raisins, prunes, and blackberries. Also the aroma of bitter dark chocolate, molasses, a touch of espresso, and wet wood.  T: Sly, deceptive, and intriguing. Dark fruit and molasses ease this beer into your mouth, with a punch of wood vapors, burnt spice, licorice, and chocolate on the back end. Dried cranberries, molasses, a hint of raisin, coffee, marjoram, and leather linger long after the swallow. The unique brewing barrel imparts a distinct wood flavor that haunts the senses, barely eluding description on the tongue. Fascinating and enjoyable. ""A treat.""  M: Syrupy without being thick. Carbonated on the front with a ghostly afterfeel. The presence of the beer, once imbibed, is felt in your mouth like the phantom pain of a missing limb.

S- Deep roast and whiskey like characteristics from the high alcohol and wood.  T- Sweet sugars up front are followed by light roast and whiskey with a little vanilla and a ton of tannin and wood character on the end.  M- A bit syrupy but the high alcohol keeps it from being overly thick and light carbonation having it go down easy, not great.

Plums, cherries, raisins, plus noticeable vanilla, and overall sweet smelling. The taste matched, though more of the fruitiness in the smell than the taste. Wish I had more to say here, but the nose caught my attention more than the taste. Some residual sweetness.  Mouthfeel was smooth for the high ABV. Alcohol was warming, but not hot, with lingering sweetness.  Overall, this is not your average brown ale. Like most DFH beers, it is in its own category. But very good.

10099,33832,TheBrewo,3.97,"We pour a brew of the darkest red-brown color. It gives no head whatsoever, until the very last drops enter into the glass, when it stirs a brief whirlwind of bubbles that quickly disappears. The brew appears like motor oil and the bubbles from within rise slowly. No sediment or haze is noted. The aroma presents in very much the same way as a barrel aged stout would. You get char-roasted malts and an insane woody character that gives a bit of earth, and a bit of dirt. All 12% of the abv is hard to hide, and some fusel alcohols seep out to sting the nose, especially with some added warmth. There is additional deepness, added by what is seemingly chocolate or raw coffee bean. Sweet pit fruits and berries ride high against this bitterness, offering a smooth balance along with some cooling raw vanilla pods. Again, if we didn’t know better, this would be guessed as a stout if left to judge solely by the nose. As we sip, the darkest malts crash the palate. These ride high on a wave of booze soaked wood. There is charcoal and a severe roast to all of the flavors here, giving a dark and fiery mash. The middle peaks with a sweetness of hop slickness, only to fall away to further depth of grain, bitter chocolate, and a cutting vanilla swirl. There is also sweetness of dark fruits, of black cherries and faint plum flavoring. The end finishes with drying oak to absorb what is left of the deep flavors from before. Here, too, we get further vanilla to aid the woodiness which is drying the rest of the palate clean. The aftertaste breathes of black coffee, roasty malts, thick woody barrels, and a healthy serving of booze. There is also a nutty muskiness, not dissimilar to that of a fresh coconut bite. The body is thick and full, and the carbonation is surprisingly high, despite the lack of head. Each sip is introduced on the edge of a fine froth and slurp, again, in spite of very little head. There is a nice coating, only to leave the mouth astringently dried, thanks to the huge woody inclusions. The abv is way over the top, and the beer drinks with the ease of any massive boozy stout.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the stark woodiness. Not only did the nose explode with notes of a unique woody character, but the taste correspondingly lived up to the nose’s name. What we were presented with was an epic “brown ale” which looked, smelled, and tasted more the part of a fatty stout. This being said, this was a great beer, but it seemed a little out of proportion for the style. Again, this doesn’t really matter, except for classification’s sake, but this was quite a surprising beer, and a robust one at that.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,akorsak,4.2,"Digestif at the brewpub. Served in a snifter.  A: The brown ale is dark, black as a good stout. Opacity is the result, nestled underneath a tan head. The ale looks still.  S: The ale has a rich nose, darker malts, sweet sugars and a woody punch. Vinous aromas waft out of my glass, a complexity that carries into the taste.  T: Deep and rich, the ale has a complexity that is tough to beer. Sweet darker notes, roasted with chocolate and wine, lead directly to the palo santo wood, a full flavor that has a little more substance than oak. Each sip has a vinous fullness, sweet and boozy with plenty of darker fruits lying around. The warming finish, more fruits, is a reward in itself.  M: Bold and dark, the brown ale is easily one of the most complex wood-aged beers I've had. Glad it was on tap when we arrived.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

I gave it a pour, comes out as a really thick dark brown color with a thinner light brown head on top. The smell of the beer is full of wood that this beer is aged on. The aroma is also kind of sweet smelling and rich with brown sugar I think. The taste of the beer is a big, it's got some of the biggest flavors I've ever had from a brown ale.

T: vanilla and cinnamon. the cinnamon spice is very zesty. nutmeg. booze throughout, but not burning. pure maple syrup. maybe even molasses. not to leave the wood entirely out, it works its way in between the sweetness, but not as prevalent as the nose. more sweetness than roast.

The most prevelent notes are totally oak, woodiness though.  T: OMG yum!!!!

10099,33832,output01x,4.42,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle (no date) into a snifter glass.  A vigorous pour yields a 2-finger tan-colored head atop a near black mahogany body. The head recedes after a few minutes to a thin dusting and thick foam ring. A little lacing is noticed as the beer disappears.  Dark, sweet malts give notes of dark fruits, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, roasted nuts, boozy, and, of course, wood. The aromas are deep, dark, and delicious.  Sweet, dark fruit flavors of cherry and raisins start each sip with a little tartness. Notes of vanilla, milk chocolate, and light coffee are then matched with a strong wood flavor. A decent alcohol booziness finishes each sip but does not indicate the full 12% ABV in this beer.  Full bodied with decent carbonation, this beer coats your mouth well but is a little sticky. The carbonation is not extremely noticeable but is just enough to help make this beer drinkable.

10099,33832,jondeelee,4.68,"Midnight black with a coffee-foam brown head, this brew smells of vanilla, caramel, and brown sugar.  On the tongue, it's an explosion of flavors so sudden and profound that it's initially difficult to wrap your head around what's going on in your mouth. Heavily malty, one of the first sensations is of dark sugars and darker fruits: caramelized bananas drizzled in molasses; turbinado sugar. Deep beneath is a light layer of coffees and, if my tongue doesn't lie, a smattering of chocolate malt. There's also a moderate current of hops streaming through, nicely illuminating and setting off the sugars. It's also obvious that this was aged in wood--""exotic Paraguayan Palo Santo wood"" to quote the bottle--due to the hint of woody, maple syrupy flavors that wind through.  I'm quite astounded by this beer, both for its audacity and craftsmanship, as well as the melange of flavors that is at once beer and cognac, and always complex and imaginative. Some may find this brew overly sweet or sugary, but to say so takes away from the many layers of sugars (in itself quite amazing), as well as the coffees and grapefruit bitters that lie just underneath. Five stars.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Smell has some wood and some fishy tartness... not bad, but odd. Trace of cherry.  It's tangier than I anticipated, for sure. There's some bitter (wild?) cherry, and I'm guessing this is the wood that's coming through. Body is slightly sweet, very malty. Finish has some alcohol and bitterness. Not my first time having this, but it's been a while. I'm not inspired to seek it out again. I got pretty much none of the vanilla or caramel suggested on the bottle. As it warms though, it does mellow out, and develop some mushroomy character.  Mouthfeel is not carby, but pretty syrupy-thick. Aftertaste has a syrup presence as well.  Overall, from Dogfish, and with the description, I was anticipating more. Maybe it wants to be cellared?  EDIT: Tried an '08 bottle at DFH Brewing and Eats in Rehoboth Beach in Dec 2011. The nose is potent and malty, maybe some kola nut. The tangy (wood?) flavor is well developed-- curiously also some iron and spice as well. Textured held up well with age.

10099,33832,sergeantstogie,3.1,"Bottle dated 11/11/10 B  Required a very vigorous pour that produced a nice big fluffy head that dissipated pretty quick with no lacing in my Duvel tulip.  Gorgeous dark brown color.  Smelled of alcohol and slight caramel malts. I blew my nose several times to check if something was off with me. No change though.  The taste surprised me. I remember loving this beer. This time around it just seems like strength for the sake of strength. I am not getting any wood notes or vanilla that I remembered. I had to check the bottle to note it's 12% ABV. Makes sense that most of what I am getting flavor wise is alcohol accented with some roasted grain.  It is smooth though for being such a big beer. Those guys at DFH know what they are doing with big beers, but I am thinking maybe those 10,000 gallon Palo Santo tanks they built are past their usefulness.  Overall, I am grateful to drink this but I won't be searching it out. I really am grateful a great BA was kind enough to send this to me and in no way want this review to reflect on Doublesimcoe's generosity. I really wanted to be (re)blown away by this beer solely on his kindness, but I have to be honest. I did not get wood from this beer.  Also, American Brown Ale. Really?

Dark brown opaque body, no visible carbonation. The wood aroma is somewhat balanced by caramel malts with little hop odors and a overpowering booziness. Taste is overwhelming boozy, not any balance at all. Pretty full mouthfeel with little effervescence, significant alcohol heat. I didn't like this at all and won't have any in the future. One of my least favorite beers I've had the entire year. Perhaps the issue is the Imperial Brown category, not a big fan of this, lacking in balance and nuance. Evidently I'm not an Off Center Person. Avoid.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Yagman3000,3.8,"Served from a 12oz. bottle into a goblet.  Appears a pretty straight dark brown with maybe the slightest hint of maroon. A thick foamy head was created by pouring relatively slowly and come creamy lacing is sticking to the sides.  Smells a little like rum and vanilla. The palo santo wood definitely seems to have a barrel aging effect on this beer. The color seems to make more sense now and I'm excited to see what this tastes like. No real hop bitterness perceived.  Tastes smokier than I anticipated... is this from the wood aging? A bit of dark chocolate and coffee bitterness are picked up after a few sips.  Mouthfeel is a strong burn from the beginning to the end. It's a bit boozy at 12%. There's a little chocolatey bitter aftertaste in here too.  This was good but, as I remember from before I started formally writing up reviews on BA, this wood-aging doesn't impart the flavors I've been typically enjoying. I'd like a little less of a burnt boozy taste and that's what is memorable concerning this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

T - WHOA! slightly off style due to the uniqueness, i'll forgive that ;) Awesome brew! huge chocolate and malt notes with delicate hop schedule. Very rich with a slight musty twang...  M - Perfect carbonation with awesome bitterness! Slightly dry leaving you quickly. I wish this one stuck around a little longer on the tongue...

10099,33832,Sensaray,4.3,"Full pour produces a deep dark brown liquid which produces a large foamy fluffy brown head. It looks really good. Retained head entire length and laced glass.  Smells like wood, i assume palo santo wood, dark malts, roasty caramel, roast coffee, chocolate, booze, resinous dark fruit.  Powerful beverage here. A bit spicy leads to some dark fruits and dark chocolate which closes with a alcoholic punch leaving coffee and chocolate mixing on the palate. Toffee, kinda heath bar sort of thing at times.

10099,33832,chefelf,3.85,This beer had a lovely dark black look with brown foam after pouring into a tulip glass. The smell and taste were much more mellow than I'd expected. At 12% ABV I was expecting a much more powerful taste.  I paired this with some barbecued St. Louis ribs and it was great. The alcohol was nowhere near as pronounced a I'd thought it would be.

The woodsy smell from the palo santo is prevalent, but it's not over the top.  T: The sweet malts are bringing out some chocolatey/coffee flavors, as well as some raisin or fig. Still there is decent bitterness to it, as it hasn't fallen completely into the sweet side. Almost none of the 12% abv this one touts. Very well masked.

10099,33832,JTSbeerislife,4.67,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Snifter. Bottled 9/13/10, purchased 2/2011 and well stored.  Pours a nice one finger head which settles rapidly to a 1/8” cap. Very deep, almost black, brown color, very brown colored head.  The very powerful smell is one of huge deep roasted malt and distinct yeast, vinous alcohol, and a rich complex aroma of dried fruits (figs, caramelized apricot, etc.) a true pleasure.  Incredibly deep rich flavor, dark unsweetened chocolate, dried figs, huge malt, yeast, very complex with the flavors constantly changing as one dominates then gives into another, the 12% ABV is here but is very wine like and takes nothing away from delicious flavors of this ale, very full bodied of course with the ABV and intensity of this ale both playing their part, all of this becomes more and more intense as the ale warms to its sweet spot of around 55-60 degrees, light and very fine carbonation balances perfectly.  Just flat out delicious!  The finish lasts forever with the intense malt and dried fruit sticking to your mouth, impossible to wash away. The ABV hangs in the back reminding you that you are drinking a real ale.  This is a tremendous ale and it is a privilege to drink. It was an expensive case at $85 but considering what you get it is actually a bargain. Ales of this power and complexity are rare even in this “Golden Age” of the Craft Brewer. This cannot be considered a session ale, but that being said I find it quite easy to drink three of these over the course of 1 ½ to 2 hours.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,robertmarsh,4.92,Overall probably one of the top 3 beers I've ever had. Has the initial appearance of imperial stout. The aroma is fantastic with the aged wood really standing out along with hints of vanilla. The taste picks up right where the aroma leaves off with the warm malty flavor with a high alcohol kick. At 12% you've gotta be careful with this one as it can be very easy to have one too many. By far the best beer in the Dogfish portfolio.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

It's a dark beer, given the time of year, but I had to give it a whirl. I freely admit this will be infinitely more enjoyable when the weather cools down. It wasn't until I drank my first two that I realized this was a 12% beer. While it has a nice strong profile to it, the alcohol content is marginally noticeable. Be careful with these.

10099,33832,hoptualBrew,3.91,"12oz bottle with bottle date on the neck as 04/18/2011.  Poured into big snifter a jet black with a coffee khaki head that sticks around for a bit. This looks like a Imperial Stout - not a brown ale, but looks delicious none the less.  In the nose is alot of wood, booze, and vanilla. Mostly wood & booze though, holy shit I can tell this is going to be a hot beer.  Little alcohol burn up front on the tongue with notes of sweet chocolate maltiness & that wood flavoring coming through. Almost like chewing on a few chocolate liquer soaked wood chips, but in a pleasant way. It works. I almost want to say, ""Brown ale my ass!"" but then that lively brown ale characteristic malt punch shows through & differentiates itself from a stout. Alcohol burn at the back is quite the dominant beast - untamed and ravaging the shit out of my throat. But luckily I thoroughly enjoy a nice alcohol burn at the back of dark brews.  Thick as any Imperial Stout you will frequent, (8/10). Carbonation is maybe a little too much, but nothing to gripe about.  Single bottle at Total Wine for $3.99. A bit pricy for my taste - might get one more to cellar for a year to see if some of that heat backs down to let the other flavors (vanilla & caramel) unfold.  *For the record, I would consider this an Imperial Brown Ale if anything.*",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,haazer,3.91,"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Bottled on 11/11/10.  A- Pours like that of an imperial stout. Tiny bubbles fill the dark brown, almost black opaque brew. The massive tan foamy cap takes a long time to settle down, and leaves some spotty patches of lacing on the glass.  S- Upon first whiff I get the scent of sweet caramel, roast malt, and some fruity berries surprisingly. Some underlying chocolate masks what little, if any scent of wood. Then again I know nothing of this Palo Santo stuff. Tiny bit of booze in the hairs of the nostrils.  T- The sweetness of the berry aroma makes it's way into the flavor, mostly that of blackberry from what I can taste. The malts taste slightly roasted but more towards the caramel variety. The 12% booze makes it's presence known with a heatwave in the mouth, and candy sugar to reach that percentage. The last, and strongest flavor, is that of the wood. It really comes in hard, but works well in the beers flavor.  M- The brew is medium to full bodied. The carbonation s a little tickling but it still manages to be rather smooth. A nice amount of heat starts in the back of the mouth and warms the belly.  O- This is a very good, widely available brew, and probably the best I've had from DFH. Of course it's got high abv but they masked it well. The berry and wood flavor blend so well in this. I highly recommend this and would certainly have again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Klym,4.25,"Bottle date 01/06/11. Poured into a Lost Abbey tulip. Shared with Cavery.  A: Black with a slightly taned two finger head. The head on tis thing is beautiful, parts of it look like cream, others are large bubbled, parts collapse with spotty but major lacing. Head dies down but the beer still looks great.  S: Big time wood with brown sugar, maple syrup, some chocolate, a tad of black licorice, and a little mesquite bbq flavoring. Not as much heat in the nose as I was expecting.  T: Deep wooden notes with a touch of roast to them come through, very unique aspects to the wood, savory, earthy, but even a tad tart. Big sweetness swishes through the mouth-- the maple syrup, chocolate, and black licorice. A nice savory barbecue character but plenty of sweetness that leaves me licking my lips. I really get a lot of nice kicks out of this beer, really delicious.  M: A medium body that can throw you off due to the creaminess of the head and carbonation in this. For the style it has an amazing body. There is a drying, sticky residue-like character to the after feel of the beer and the heat can be a little catching in the back of the throat but they all seem to just testify to the 'bigness' of this beer. Great!  O: I didn't expect such a widely available beer that only gets peripheral attention to have so much unique character and be so bold. I really liked this, and have 3 more from my four pack laid down and aging. I can't wait to see what aging will do to this and can't wait to revisit it.

10099,33832,Cavery,4.07,"12oz cellared for half the year, shared with Klym. Bottle date reads 1/06/11.  Poured into Lost Abbey Tulip.  A: A deep rich red/brown/black tree bark body with red/brown bubbles. A very respectable 2 finger head with watermark lacing. A mix of small and microfiber bubbles mesh together like fine pebbles. The body is mostly black with some dark red give to it -- this is about the only thing that could make you believe this is a brown.  S: Deep swirling sweet woods. Notes of alcohol dowsed raspberries, bourbon wood, and sweet chiles in chocolate. A complex nose where alcohol dominates the character. The wood is very complex, and gives strong seasonings of vanilla pods, nutmeg, and cinnamon sticks. A soft note of candied bay leaves makes me happy.  T: Sweet alcoholic raspberries and barrel-aged terriyakis. The sweetness comes off like an imperial serving of chai teas, complex but a bit sweet and forward. All of those flavors occur before the alcohol grabs your tongue and submits it with brute force. The wood helps soften the bite of the alcohol, but the heat is alive and well. The alcohol is definitely a bit strong, but it's not keeping me from drinking by any means. Creamy vanilla figs and dates in the end.  M: Fairly creamy with a medium body. The carbonation helps keep this soft, fresh out of the drier blanket soft. The wood is fairly drying, leaving a slightly damp (from the alcohol) velvet glove over the tongue. Perhaps a little bit inconsistent depending on the rip, but promising. The alcohol does give a bit more wetness than I'd like, but not awful.  O: This beer needs more time, but man it's not drinking so bad right now. I remember trying this quite fresh before, and it was a hot mess. This is much better, and progressing at an impressive rate. Right now it's hard for me to assess what the potential cap of this beer could be, and at 12% abv, it could be quite a while. The complexity of the Palo wood is going to take this to new and exciting places; I anticipate that mellowing the alcohol with the wood will take this to incredible heights. This is certainly a beer to revisit every 6 months or so. What a joy it is to be able to get this in 4 packs.

I first get sweet malts which taste of caramel and vanilla followed by a strong presence of alcohol. As the beer warmed I started picking up some wood notes.  This first coats the mouth, it's nice and smooth until the alcohol punch comes in. It's a strong beer at 12% and it doesn't let you forget that easily.  An interesting beer with an interesting story. There are strong flavors in this beer but I can't get over the taste of alcohol. The alcohol is warming as it goes down.

S: It might be me or have something to do with the thickness of the beer but I cannot smell much, just malts with a burnt tinge to it. Still quite pleasant though.  T: It's very hoppy, surprisingly so for a brown ale. There's also a strange taste present which one assumes to be the wood they are so proud of putting in. As the beers warms the malts come out and the hops seem to be balanced alot better, very well in fact, and the vanilla taste from the wood mixes into the blend, leaving you with a very enjoyable experience.  M: What can I say - like oil, such a treat going down, and a light carbonation at that too.  O: Such a pleasure to drink this beer, it's expensive but worth it if you love bold, thick, dark, malty ales. Also it's worth mentioning that I got this from beersofeurope.co.uk a few weeks before Dogfish Head announced they would be stopping exports so i'm quite lucky I have had a chance at trying this (plus I have one more left which will be saved for a cold winters evening!)

10099,33832,deadonhisfeet,4.33,"I stored this bottle in the fridge but decided to let it sit out at room temperature for a half hour before serving it in a snifter. It pours out extremely dark brown with a nice chunky tan head that quickly dissipates. The nose offers toast, vanilla, marzipan, and leather.  Very intense sweetish flavors of toasted malt, oaky vanilla, and cocoa with a very, very slight booziness in the background. As the beer moves across your palate, jammy and figgy flavors develop. I didn't detect much of a hop presence here, but the malt is so heavily entrenched I'm not sure a reasonable hop presence would even BE noticeable.  I think we need a new category for this beer. How about we call it an Imperial Brown Ale? The flavor of this beer reminded me a lot of Bourbon County Stout. Even with the faint booziness, it's hard to believe this beer is 12% alcohol. According to the label, this beer should be aged to allow the flavors to round out a bit. I concur. I think I'll go back to the store tomorrow and buy a few more bottles so I can age them.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

After taste is diffenitly wood. Surprised at first. Second sip was still sceptical, buy the third sip it was a welcome treat.

10099,33832,BBP,4.18,"A- Pours to look like a stout. The downside being that aside from the darkness, it's somewhat lacking in head and the lacing is slight.  S- Very roasty aromas. Slight notes of sweetness, but mostly from alcohol. Some dark fruit is very subtle as well.  T- Very nice flavor. Coffee and chocolate are plentiful, and in that order. Roasted malt isn't lacking either. I also get a lot of caramel, which is somewhat hidden behind the roastiness.  After the sip is gone, it tastes quite interesting. I think it's the wood I'm tasting. It tastes slightly bitter and slightly sweet.  M- Feels nice on the tongue. I found that it was a bit overcarbonated though. Aside from that, it aces this category.  O- This ale was really surprising to me. First of all, it tasted like a stout and I was expecting a brown ale. Second of all, it had a ton of roasted flavor regardless of style.  I think this is probably one of the best beers DFH makes. For the most part I find their beers to be above average and nothing more, but this one is good and seems less like a rough draft, and more like every detail was how it was supposed to be.

It somehow tastes of chocolate and vanilla at the same time. Like the exact mix of chocolate of vanilla without either overpowering the other. It also has a Cabernet-like taste to it from the brewing vessels. It tastes as delicate and rich as it smells.  M: A very warm, cold numbing bite to it but the alcohol presence isn't as bold as I thought it would be. It's there, but it simply enhances the other rich flavors.

Body is very dark brown, nearly black. Faint ruby highlights when held to the light.  Nose is very complex. First thing that jumps out at me is a dark fruit and fig sweetness I wasn't expecting. Then the dark roasted chocolate kicks in with a big whiff of alcohol close behind. There's also a nice woody aroma and subtle vanilla. All becomes more intense as the beer warms. They all work together and keep each other in check.  First sip brings a warm and malty sensation. The palo santo tanks really do bring a uniqueness to the beer. Woodiness is backed by vanilla and caramel. Dark fruit provides a measure of sweetness and the finish is surprisingly smooth. The alcohol warms as it all goes down.  Mouthfeel is creamy without the heaviness one might expect.  Overall...I love this beer. It's a complex sipper that always wakes up my palate.

10099,33832,MONKandTUCK,3.98,"I gotta admit... I thought I was going to hate this.  After a long day of drinking, eating, and taking in the Delaware sun, I thought it excessive to try this one. Then I remembered how long I've wanted to visit the DFH brewery, and how long it'll probably be before I return.  The other beers I had been drinking were their most mundane... in that effect, I was already doing something very unique to DFH... my friends and I were shocked Sam has Shelter Pale Ale and Lawn Mower beer on draught, but that's what we found ourselves drinking.  So then came this one, after dinner:  APPEARANCE- Initally looks like a Brown Ale. Thick, though not perfectly opaque. round ring of off-white foam at the top.  AROMA- dark fruits, earth, bittersweet choc.  TASTE- Heat bites into the palate on the first sip. Thereafter, a heavy syrupy body rolls over the tongue and coats the mouth before being rushed off by the alcohol. Woody, notes of caramel, raisin.  It's sweeter and not as sharp as your typical Barleywine or Old Ale. It's not like Port Wine... or Whiskey like a lot of the Bourbon Barrel-aged beers are. It's closer to a Brown Ale or Dark Mild in that respect.  If you know anyone who likes pairing Red Wine and Dark Chocolate, age some of this beer for a year and surprise them with it. You'll have a craft beer drinking convert.  It's A very complex barley wine, with the Bourdeux, bitter-sweet chocolate, Bourbon Vanilla, dominate with some woody character in the background right before the alcholic heat. This is a DFH brew, so hops prevail in the flavor and finish. Thankfully, they don't leave the beer out of whack, but work to hold all that malt together.  Not much more than that, but obviously those are all very intense flavors.  MOUTHFEEL- Not syrupy, not leathery. Just a big beer. I would liken it to the 90 Minute IPA, but w/o the hop intensity.  OVERALL- I couldn't finish it. Mostly because i had already consumed so much that day and my table was getting restless. And I'm not sure if the Pale Santo Marron really does this beer any favors besides favorable marketing.  It's a strong, strong beer. It doesn't hide that, though I suspect mine had been aged providing some mellowing.  It picks up some character as it warms. Honestly, I was worried it would present some off-flavors. It's not the greatest beer I have ever had, but the Chocolate-Red Wine date basket thing that was going on was very cool.  Again I'm not sure how much the chosen wood vessels enhanced this brew. Though, I'm glad it was aged and not in oak.  Maybe there were subtleties lost on me. I usually shy away from stronger brews due to their price tag and immaturity. I want to drink something fine-tuned for enjoyment, not a self-gratifying experiment.  So be it if I missed a few sophisticated nuances.. at the same time I probably have provided this beer more praise because it exceeded rather low expectations.  I do suggest seeking it out.... if the flavors described are your thing. However, this beer is worthless greeen. Aged two years it should be impeccable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

The finish is a mix of alcohol along with the vanilla and caramel flavors that come from the wood barrels. The high ABV and the overall boozey flavor to this one hurt its drinkability but all things considered you can still drink it at a decent pace.

Wonderful aroma, full of vanilla, hints of warming alcohol, sweet toffee and dark fruits--much like a stout but heavier on the dark fruit and a lighter roasted character. This sure comes as a shock to my IPA-laden palate--layers upon layers of malty goodness. Roasted/nutty malt is much more apparent in the taste with some chocolate as well. Lots of caramel/vanilla sweetness, the wood aging seems to be doing great things. Warm finish with the alcohol helping to dry it out. Aftertaste is highly reminiscent of a nice rum.

The wood-aging reminds me a bit of bourbon, and pairs well with the sweet caramel, vanilla, dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and a bit of alcohol. The taste on this is very similar to that of a huge imperial stout. Dark fruits, a strong roastiness, some chocolate and vanilla sweetness and smokiness probably imparted from the wood. Booze is present, but nowhere near distracting. Great.  The mouthfeel is on the thinner side of full-bodied and has the right level of carbonation. The drinkability is fairly good for such a huge beer, this is a sipper that reveals complexities as it warms, but surely isn't hard to drink. Overall, this is a great brew.

Smell is a bit subtle for the strength of this brew with roast, chocolate, and some vinous qualities and some raisin like notes.  Taste is superb with a blend of malty greatness: big chocolate and roast blend with subtle caramel, notes of vanilla, rum. No boozy or estery qualities. Bitterness is enough to counter sweetness and provides some lingering crispness.  Mouthfeel is reminds me of my original review - hard to believe this is 12% - just so smooth for a potential cloying malt bomb.  Overall just a great malty beer with incredible simple flavors but great depth and easy drinking qualities.  Original:Poured into a harpoon 6 oz tasting glass; very thin tan head that dissipates but clings a little; color is dark brown to black.

As the carbonation dies down and the sip ends, there's a very woody taste which rings with alcohol flavor. If the aftertaste weren't quite so unwelcomely bitey, this would be perfect.  Overall: A very good brew. Above average for the style, and impressive taste considering the high volume of alcohol. I could easily make this a weekend sipper (one or two bottles ought to do the trick...three if I didn't have to get up in the morning).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,MikeM40,4.65,"Poured into a DFH Signature glass. This brew pours a near black and produces only a slight tan head. It is a big and bold Imperial Brown ale that can hang with some Imperial Stouts. Wonderful aromas of plums and raisins and black cherries. The sweet fruits smell delicious.The carbonation is low and the mouthfeel is medium thick.  Flavors of blackberry and burnt cherry are immediate along with dark fruits and chocolate and hints of expresso and malt. Dark and sweet fruits go back and forth and lay down the flavor profile. This brew is amazingly complex with a slight licorice and bitter black coffee finish. The alcohol presence is there but not overwhelming. This brew is delicious,of my absolute favorites.

Aroma is rather hot and extremely woody. The wood is cedar-like, but that's probably the palo santo wood with which I have no experience identifying until now. Next up we have fig and raisins like that of Raison D'etre, and hot alcoholic raisins like that of Brooklyn Monster. There are definitely some smoked malts in the background and a hint of grainy-rye.  Taste is very hot, beginning with a moderate helping of palo santo, moving into a touch of chicory, and ending with a good deal of smoke. After warming, prunes are present but faint in the taste.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and puts a very dry feeling onto the palate. Sweet malts and a touch of smoke stick to the palate. Overall, what a fantastic slow sipper.

There is almost no head to be seen.  Palo Santo smells great. Lots of chocolate and vanilla and no small amount of roastiness.  Tastes like woody chocolate. There is a short bitter zing at the beginning of the taste. A bit of vanilla and alcohol come through in the finish. The flavor is complex and hard to explain, but it is very good.  I'm a little weary of Dogfish Head in that I would like to enjoy everything they make, but some of their brews just don't impress me.

Looks like a really good porter, or maybe even an expertly made cappuccino Simply a beauty of a beer.  S: Quite a malt bomb here. very sweet. Alcohol is pungent but adds to the sensation. Dark and ripe fruits. cherry, apricot etc. sort of a pine and maple sent as well. fairly subdued on the nose - compared to expectations anyways.  T: I wasn't initially wowed by this one, but after careful contemplation; this is one hell of a brown ale! Salty, sweet, bready and rich. This is an excellent dessert beer. The wood is there, but much different than oak. It interferes much less with the beer.  M: One of the thickest beers Ive had in recent memory. amazingly not super sticky, and alchohol does a good job at mopping things up on the finish. Carbonation is smooth but ample and lifting.

Beer is very dark brown/black. Nice clingy lacing  S- Reminds me of going camping. Like burning pine tree wood with hints of burnt oak. Also a light, sweet malty smell. Really nostalgic smell that I find very pleasurable.  T- Instead of the burnt wood that you smell, the taste is of fresh wood, coffee, chocolate, dates, caramel, mollasses, and finishes with a little caramelized brown sugar. Very complex and very good. Alcohol is barely noticable. Just slight warmth  M- Nice mouthfeel. Carbonation level is nice. Viscosity of brew is nice.  O- This is an excellent beer. On bottom of the bottle is 3110 B2 1750.

A big 2 finger mocha brown head that kicked back for a few minutes then slowly dissipated back into the murky depths leaving plentiful lacing as a reminder of what used to be.  S- You can definately smell wood in there along with some mild chocolate malt and fruit. Alcohol is slightly detectable but not in a bad way.  T: There's definitely a strong wood taste up front like an Ip Man kick to the kisser but wait, vanilla, chocolate and coffee join the party and softens the blow. All of these components compliment each other as the beer warms.  M: Medium bodied with light carbonation. Smooth and yummy.  O: This beer an intrigues me.

The end is strong barley and burnt malt. I swear I taste World Wide Stout here. What happens in between is something of a jungle mystery: dank forest, fresh herbs, grass, a green apple, sour dough bread, caramel. The booze are well hidden but you cant completely hide 12%.

But if you need a good sipping beer after dinner, especially with dessert, this beer is an exceptional choice.  There is a warm alcohol sense in the forefront, much like drinking dark rum. The vanilla and caramel scents and tastes are evident, though I wouldn't say they are distinguishable. Rather than vanilla and caramel I would say vanilla/caramel.

Lacing looks nice. Lots of alcohol feet clinging to the sides. Not really brown in the appearance in any respect, but I guess I'll let this slide for DFH.  Aroma is predominantly caramel malts and *apparently* the wood character from the barrel aging process. Vanilla underneath. Not an aroma bomb.  Taste is a bit more involving. Getting some booze up front with a lot more of the Palo Santo character and vanilla. Malts linger throughout the drink with a slight hop offset near the end for a good bit of balance.  Mouthfeel is fitting. Smooth with good carbonation. Medium-length finish is relatively dry and likewise lingers a bit.  A good brew, one of the better ones from DFH.

Less than a fingers worth of a reddish-tan head sits very briefly. Oily sticky legs cling.  The nose is full of vanilla up front with some sweet molasses in there as well. The booze isn't hiding in this one. A warming alcohol scent is quite noticeable but not deterring. Some rosty malts and dark fruits are noticed as well. You can really smell what the wooden barrels has done to this beer.  The taste is phenomenal. The vanilla and oak offerings come in and are matched with a semi-sweet chocolate taste that is roasted and smokey all at once. A molasses taste is noticed followed by a bit of fig on the back end. A smokey undertone mixed with the coca is delightful.  The mouthfeel is certainly full-bodied. The thick viscous beverage sticks to my palate and spreads the flavors, keeping an aftertaste around for quite some time.  Overall, I had one of these when it was fresh and a little bit of age surely does this one justice! The alcohol eased up a bit and the flavors have melded together very nicely.

I have been starting to like Dogfish Head lately and thought it was time to try one of their big guns. I have never had a Brown Ale that was this strong so we'll see how it goes. Bottled on December 6, 2010. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into my mini snifter.  A- The label looks OK and I like the wooden theme going on with this bottle. It poured a super deep dark brown color that was on the edge of being black that had the slightest bit of ruby edges when held to the light. It had a fingers worth of tan colored head that died down to a really thin ring.  S- The first thing that stuck out to me about the aroma was the large presence of dark fruits, it's reminiscent of a strong doppelbock. There was some nice roasty aromas along with smoke and wood. It smells boozy but for 12% thats to be expected. I would have liked it to have more smoke and wood aromas to balance out the dark fruits.  T- Wow there is a lot of things going on with this brew, the flavor is really complex. It starts out with some nice sweet lightly roasted malts that impart a nice molasses like flavor along with some grainy earthyness. The dark fruits are toned down, which I was hoping for. The smokey wood is right where I like it and works nicely with the light amount of dark fruits. There is some slight bitterness on the finish and some warming alcohol, which was masked very well.  M- Full bodied with a semi dry finish and it had an average amount of carbonation and I thought it could have used just a little more.  Overall I thought this was a very good and unique brew, really different from your typical American Brown Ale, I never see one this strong. From my experience it seems like Dogfish Head has a thing for making unique and extreme Brown Ales, you usually don't see much creativity with this style. To me it seems like Shorts and Dogfish Head are leading the way in making unique browns, I like it. The taste of this beer was pretty good and complex, the Palo Santo wood imparted some nice flavors that I liked and I thought they worked very well with this beer. For being 12% this beer is dangerously drinkable, they did a great job at toning down the booze and making this seem much lighter then it really is. I would buy a four pack of this too keep in the fridge. If you like browns but want something bigger and unique, give this a try, you might be surprised. This was another great beer from Dogfish Head, you guys keep on impressing me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,kyleelton,4.49,"For some reason I was expecting a more dark amber color than an almost black. Don't know why. This was a pleasant surprise. The deep deep brown indicated that this was going to be something more than I expected.  The smell was typical for heavy beer of 12% ABV. Lots of alcohol, but there was also that smokey palo santo wood smell that I love. Wish it was more the wood, but the taste more than made up for it.  The wooden and smokey front of the beer did not, as I was afraid of, turn into a sweet, alcohol burn in the back. The taste was hops and malt, blending together beautifully with the taste of palo santo wood. One of the best tasting beers I've ever had. I know, a bold claim, but it ranks with Alaskan Smoked Porter and my first taste of craft beer (Fat Tire) in terms of how excited I am about what I'm drinking in the moment.  Smooth and slightly carbonated. A little bit of a bite at the back, but not much.  Overall, I'd say this is my favorite beer out of Dogfish Head. I love their 90 minute, but this is just so unique and different.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,abraxel,4.35,"A - Opaque, dark, dark brown. It doesn't look quite black, but no light shines through. A small amount of dense, creamy, tan head that drops some but leaves tons of lacing (is it called lacing if it's a solid layer?) on the glass.  S - Lots of caramel mixed into roasty malts and some coffee, with a bit of something else which I assume is that Palo Santo wood, perhaps?  T - Whoa, that's complex. I need another sip to get my bearings.  mm... that's better. Very sweet, dark maltiness: dark fruit, caramel, coffee roastiness, altogether quite nice. The whole thing is hard to describe, though, because of an unusual sort of acidity that confounds the taste buds at first sip and tickles them throughout, making this rather heavy, sweet beer feel light as it dances across your tongue. At the finish, I get a better picture of that slightly indescribable taste which I haven't met in any other beer -- it must be the Palo Santo wood. Nutty, woody, acidic, weird, tasty.  M - Thick and creamy, but the touch of acidity seems to prevent it from being cloying. The alcohol is noticeable, but blends in. Quite a good balance.  Overall, this is great.

This isn’t a stout, it isn’t a brown ale so I’m a bit lost. It is however simply amazing. I’ve loved this beer since it first came out. I loved it fresh, loved it aged, loved it on tap. Finally, taking the time to review it and well it’s hard to review. Sweet candy flavors, woody flavors, honey, yet strong impressive hops to keep things from being too sweet.  Thick, creamy, well carbonated, and just perfect for what ever this is.  I think Baton Burton is dogfish’s best beer, but this is a very close second.

S- Vanilla, roastiness, and a tiny bit of wood. I head this beer was an amazing smell like walking into Home Depot. lol. So, a little disappointing on the smell, but it is nice.  T- The taste is borderline porter or stout....which are generally my favorite styles. I'm loving the taste of this brew. Major roast and vanilla and dark fruit dominance. Hint of wood on the tongue to take you another direction. And a great bitter dry roast finish. Also, a satisfying warm alcohol presence, but not hot. Seems pretty complex to my palate.  M- Medium to heavy body. Creamy. Perfectly carbonated. Thin finish mouthfeel on the finish though. Interesting.  O- Great beer. Seems a bit more like a porter or stout to me. But, still a great beer.

10099,33832,Vixie,3.98,"Pours almost black, but you can see a bit of dark ruby at the edges. Forms a little bit of a brown head which quickly faded to some nice lacing.  Somewhat sweet smell, with notes of coffee and chocolate, and a little woody in there as well.  Nicely complex beer, I'd rate this among the most complex I've tried. There's coffee and chocolate in there, as well as caramel. I can also detect some fruit, maybe plum. Nice finish, not bitter as expected, but I think I'm detecting the wood notes.  Nicely solid, this one lets you know it's a serious beer.  This one reminds me a lot of a bourbon barrel aged beer, but less bitter. It has a sweetness I wouldn't have expected from how dark this beer is. It does have a big of an alcohol burn to it. and the high ABV makes this one a sipper, but a really nice beer.

10099,33832,zeledonia,4.47,"Pours a very dark coffee brown, barely any light coming through, even at the edges. Limited dark tan head that lasts and lasts. Looks like a stout. Streams of bubbles rising along the edges of the glass.  Wow, smell that wood. Vanilla comes through loud and clear, but is well-supported by abundant caramel sweetness from the malts. A bit of bubblegum-like fruity aroma. There's a lot there, but it's all in great balance. A hint of booze, but not much.  The dominant flavors are a rich roasted malt sweetness and that woody vanilla. The malts come through much darker and more chocolatey than they did in the smell, where I mostly got caramel. These two flavors (roasted malt and wood) kinda bounce back and forth, with a bit of hop bitterness coming in late to try to fight its way past them. These three maintain an impressive balance. Amazing that 12% alcohol isn't more evident in the taste. There is no booziness to this at all, just some solid warmth in the finish. As it warms up a bit, the alcohol is more apparent, but still surprisingly limited.  Mouthfeel is heavy and thick, but not syrupy, with medium-low carbonation (just enough to moderate the thickness). Kinda fluffy, actually.  This is a really really delicious beer. Rich dark malts, wood, a bit of fruit. It's shockingly un-boozy for the ABV. And just like that, my glass is empty. As with some of my other favorite ""brown ales"", it pushes the boundary between this style and porters/stouts. Shortly after Dogfish Head officially pulled out of Wisconsin, I passed up a 4-pack of this on a trip over there. I'm really regretting that now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

I am an avid fan of DFH beers so I had to make my own decision on this beer when I saw it in the cooler while getting a mix-o-six.  Appearance - Poured dark with a medium/fair amount of head  Smell - Wood and alcohol is the impression that hit me the hardest  Taste - Bitter. Can't really explain it more than that.  Mouthfeel - Reminded me of cough syrup. I like the tast of cough syrup, but did not like this beer.  Overall - Not very pleasing. The pour looked good and smelled ok, but I did not enjoy the taste at all. I had a hard time finishing this one, and poured out the last inch or so of my glass down the drain.

Smell: cherries is what immediately comes to mind, followed by dark fruits some slight alcohol notes as well  Taste: Brown sugar and some alcohol warmth. The fruit notes from the aroma are there but subdued. Some slight smokiness from the wood that lingers as the beer is swallowed.  Mouthfeel: It's got a full rounded mouth feel. Not light, but definitely not syrupy thick either. The carbonation is moderate and definitely helps keep the mouthfeel substantially rounded.  Drinkabillity: Dangerous. I wouldn't be pounding these back all night, but at 12% it's dangerously drinkable.

Aroma: Dark roasted malt with a lot of estery alcohol and brown sugar swirled in and some funky, earthy notes mixed in there too.  Taste: Thick and syrupy sweet, but quickly followed by a very astringent roasted flavor that cuts the sweetness without totally masking it. Some hop bitterness rides the tale end of that leading into a bitter, soapy finish that is luckily pretty fast.  The Rest: Body is very full. Another very unusual one from DFH. I'd put this in the same category as ApriHop and Midas. All very interesting beers, but not ones I really feel the need to try again.

S: The smell is smoky and strong. I caught a huge whiff just opening the bottle. There are notes of vanilla, coffee and caramel. The flavor from the Palo Santo wood really comes through; very earthy and natural.  T: The first sensation upon tasting is similar to any brown ale. There is a caramel sweetness but this quickly gives way to an explosive range of flavors. Caramel and mocha are strong flavors. I can also make out a faint brandy/cherry taste. The wood flavor is noticeable and lends a spicy, earth tone to the drink. It’s hard to miss the taste of alcohol, but it complements the overall flavor well. The aftertaste is long and bitter.

The best way to describe it was a leathery, woody smell. Very natural.  T- Standard brown ale ""sweetness"". Soon after the sip, the depth of the wood used in the brewing becomes evident. Slight fruitiness with a burnt aftertaste. Almost a porter-like quality of flavor depth.  M- Heavy, thick, and demanding. Definitely a sipping beer. Took me the better part of an hour to get the whole thing down, which was actually very pleasant.  O- Awesome beer.

Good head that shows some retention, which is surprising considering the weight of this beer.  Smell – Explosions of dark fruit, licorice, caramel , and vanilla atop a backdrop of soft wood. Similar to the character that oak-aging would give a beer, but still different.  Taste – Intense and rich malt sweetness upfront. The taste is defined by a bold oak-like character, obviously from the unique Palo Santo wood used to craft this brew. This wood flavor seems to soften a bit as this beer ages. Dark fruits, vanilla, and licorice accent the bold sweetness and the wood gives this beer a pleasant dry finish. Alcohol is well integrated and adds a punch of head to the finish.

Head was only slight and retention was minimal with only faint lacing. Typical of higher alcohol beers.  S: Smell was sweet, with vanilla and brown sugar notes on the nose. Smelled like an apricot sugar cookie.  T: Very pleasant. Nice hops balance to the sugar malts. Reminiscent of an American strong ale. Didn't get a lot of smokiness from the wood processing advertised on the bottle, but what I did get was a rich cherry flavor. Alcohol content wasn't noticeable until the last drop, then the warming kicked in.  M: Very pleasing beer to drink. Hops provided plenty of dried fruity flavor depth without much bitterness at all. Two of these and you're schnockered, so be respectful.  O: I'd consider this one to be the little brother of Worldwide Stout.

10099,33832,rawfish,3.8,"From bottle to Odell tulip, bottled on 11/11/10.  Pours dark, black in fact some ruby/purple highlights, with a two finger mocha head that is frothy with heavy lacing. A brief, hypnotizing cascade effect but really dark for a brown ale.  Powerful and complex aroma, roasted malts, not much smoke or coffee but chocolate, syrup, molasses, cherries, tart grapes and a touch of vanilla. I'm guessing those sweet dessert aromas come from the wood. Breathy alcohol, smells vaguely like a red wine.  Dark fruit figs and plum, rhubarb and earthy spices with a bitter chocolate maltiness. Very little to no hop character, not overly boozy but enough to pull the syrupy sweetness out a little more. Tart finish, slightly sweet and syrup-like, vanilla and some dryness on the back end, to represent the wood character but not enough to overcome the predominant malt.  Rather viscous not overly heavy though, lacking in carbonation but assists with the smooth drink. Alcohol hits with every exposure to air, biting. Needs to mellow down a bit more.  Not really a beer that really fits into a category but it's meant to be off centered right. Rather complex mix of flavors, like a dark earthy dessert. A definite sipper which I feel hurts the drinkability a bit since you get that alcohol kick more often. Bold and uncompromising, a strong ale with good complexity, not the kind of thing you'd want to session but a unique offering.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

I don't see this one on tap very often up in Baltimore so I had to get it. It's been a few years since I'd last had this brew.  A - Pitch black, fine bubble edged head, little carb, large grouped lacing  S - Sweet, dark roasted, mild minty notes  T - Roasted coffee, cola, rooty, woody and slightly resinous pine notes. Mild versions of all of the initial flavors through the middle finishing tart sour with a mild molasses sweetness.  M - Medium bodied, noticable alcohol warmth  O - This is a very good and unique beer. It's got the color, some notes and mouth feel of a strong stout but with some unique earthy sweet notes.

10099,33832,sommersb,4.39,"Served in a Founders tulip from a brown 12 oz. bottle with bottling date of 09-13-10.  As others have said, this is maybe the darkest brown ale out there, a near black beer, with some brown on the edges when held to light. The head is pretty small, maybe 1 finger of tan color, due to the high alcohol content. I get very little lacing.  The smells are very complex. The wood aroma from being aged in wooden barrels is there, along with dark malt notes. I can smell the alcohol even at 6 months of age on this one. Also aromas of raisins and dark fruits, chocolate, vanilla and a smokiness character. Amazing  The taste is exactly like the aroma, big and complex, with a fair amount of alcohol warmth in this strong ale. The malts give a brown bread taste, along with molasses and vanilla, plus dark, ripened fruits.  The mouthfeel is rich and chewy with a full body. The aftertaste is hard to pin down - it has a malty sweetness to it but also a dry alcohol part as well.  This is a wonderful beer. A definite slow-sipper, nightcap kind of beer, due to the richness and high alcohol content.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

I also get some dark fruit notes in the aroma. The flavor is very similar. I get a lot of oaked and wood notes, as well as some caramel and roasted malt, vanilla, spices and dark fruit. The alcohol is definitely present, but it is not overpowering. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

10099,33832,mjpolzin,4.28,"Tasted to me more like an imperial stout than a brown ale. Very hot alcohol taste but not overpowering. I really enjoyed this beer and will have to buy a lot of it up with Dogfish Head not supplying to Wisconsin anymore. Everytime I have had this beer, I wake up in the morning with a really dry mouth. It is probably the high amount of alcohol but it is well worth it.  Further notes-I taste the vanilla for sure. The wood is there as well. I still think the alcohol is hot but this beer is pretty smooth compared to others with that high of an abv.  Further notes take 2-I had a bottle of 2010 and 2008 tonight (3/1/13) for my birthday. Both were very smooth without any hot alcohol taste. I really want a few fresh bottles to compare with these that have some age on them because the alcohol seems to completely have mellowed out. If I had to pick, 2008 was a little better than the 2010 as it had a little bit of sweetness that added a nice element.

Alcohol and hops also present. Alot of armoma  Taste - This monster starts off with fruits, sweet hops, malts, tons of sugar and barley. Plenty of warmth from the booze. Man what a overload of flavors. Plenty of rasin and plum. You are crushed with all the flavors , only at the end you get the wood, oaked flavor. Brown ale? How so? Maybe in color, reminds me much more or a strong ale oak aged. Wow, this is sweet.  Mouthfeel - Really harsh on mouth. So many flavors, but in the end the alcohol is the lasting flavor. Leaves a dry finish on tounge, and a odd fruit flavor in mouth.  Overall - Right on par with other dogfish head beers, too many flavors, too sweet and intense. It almost works but its too much to enjoy. I like the dark fruits in it, but too much alcohol and sugars. I would love to try this again at around 8% and less sweetness.

10099,33832,Mississipping,4.15,"12oz bottle poured into a 3rd. rev Boulevard Smokestack Series tulip. Batch 2 is hand written on the label. Thanks to a great trading partner in MA for this extra!  A: Pours very dark brown and settles completely black with absolutely no penetration of light. For a brown ale, this is as dark as they come (and for many stouts, for that matter). Topped with a small light mocha head that almost doesn't recede at all. A foamy, stick film remains the entire glass. When rolling the glass, the foam coats the side completely, and long legs slowly fall, leaving an impressive display of lacing behind.  S: Holy aroma Dogfish Head! This smells fantastic! Immediately I am hit with bourbon, dark fruit (black cherries and fig), toffee, and wood (I assume Palo Santo, although I wouldn't be able to pinpoint it otherwise). A bit of dark chocolate and roasted malts as well, but they are subtle.  T: Interestingly, the chocolate that was so subtle in the smell is much more dominant in the flavor. It's rich chocolate, almost like letting a bittersweet morsel melt in your mouth. Behind the chocolate are hints of bourbon, toffee, dark fruit, coffee, and roasted malts. Each sip seems to highlight different characteristics, but overall, they are all there working together to produce a very rich, fairly well balance, delicious taste. It finishes with a chocolate and coffee flavor, with just a bit of booze, leaving a very nice warming effect. (As it warms, it becomes pretty hot ... not completely unpleasant, but the alcohol isn't hidden as well as I'd like it to be).  M: The mouthfeel is medium-full. Not sticky at all, but slightly heavy and sits on the tongue. Carbonation is fairly low, but enough to create a smooth creaminess. Slightly drying, mainly from the coffee and the roasted malts, but also from just a bit of hops.  D: Although delicious, not very drinkable. Between the complexity, medium viscosity, and the alcohol content, this is a sipper. It's one that you will really enjoy sipping on, though. I wish I had a few more of these to enjoy on a cool evening.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Leaves minimal lacing on the glass.  Bouquet is at first a faint wood and roast, but then gives way to salty jerky meats. In the back of my sinus (after a few sips) there are hints of dark chocolate. No hint of a high abv beer to come either. Very nice.  Taste is slightly fizzy at first but also a minor silk feel. This is a tad boozy in taste and sensations, but there is a tannic/wood in the front and middle palate. Some faint anisette on the finish and a tongue numbing sensation. Surprisingly not much roast character to this at all.

S - Huge aromas or dark roasted malt, almost-burnt caramel, vanilla, licorice, and brown sugar. Smells so sweet and rich. T - Very close to the nose, the flavors of dark malt, caramel, vanilla and brown sugar carry through nicely, along with a bit of dark dried fruits like figs or raisins. There is a slight alcohol burn as it works it's way down, the 12% ABV is pretty apparent. M - Pretty sticky and syrupy, definitely full-bodied with low carbonation.

10099,33832,Kadonny,3.82,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a stemmed wine glass.  A: Brown ale? How about black ale. I got almost no brown color out of this at all, almost a jet black color with a very slight off white head. No glass lacing.  S: Again, brown ale? I got huge roasted notes on the nose with some chocolate and sugar sweetness. A bit of woody notes are detected too with some licorice.  T: Follow the nose. If I didn't know any better I would bet this was a stout. Huge dark roasted flavor with notes of chocolate, licorice, wood and some smoke. The sugar sweetness is more of brown sugar with some caramel sweetness and maybe some sweeter chocolate. Finish remains sweet and roasty with not much hops and a large alcohol flavor. Roasted flavors linger.  M: Alcoholic, sweet, sticky almost cloying.  D: Oooh, not great. One bottle is way plenty.  Overall another different take on a beer, just like DFH likes to do. This is very different that they get props for that, but it just seems like they tried to hard on this. An ok beer, but I won't seek it out much again.

Smell strongly contains chocolate and sweet malt. Very pleasant.  Taste is great. Sweet malt and dark chocolate are present, as in the nose, but also hints of dark fruit. Alcohol is present, but in a very pleasant way. Finishes slightly bitter. All of this is accompanied by a fairly unique flavour which I imagine is the result of the palo santo wood itself.  As for mouthfeel, the beer is fairly heavy bodied, very smooth, and carbonation is pleasantly mild.  For a 12% beer, this is very very drinkable. However, make no mistake, the booze does start to become noticeable.

It has that ""sticky"" quality that's great.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,BMoldy,3.91,"Pours a completely opaque deep brown (read: black) with a decent creamy, dark chocolate head. Excellent head retention and good, well-defined lacing all the way down. The aroma is very indicative of what's to come: dark, heavy malts are enriched by a solid earthy/woody scent. The 12% ABV shows through immediately, and hops figure in pretty minimally. Taking a sip, an initial caramel sweetness fades quickly into a powerful chocolate/malt body made all the more robust by the heavy alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is very syrupy, bordering on offensive, with a medium- to low-carbonation. Fortunately, all of this means that you really only need to take a small sip to really get the full experience of this beer.  I guess ""epic"" isn't a bad word to use to describe this beer, so long as it isn't confused with ""excellent."" That said, I really do love it, and I'm tempted to buy some from time to time just to have it lying around. Still, it's a little too strong to really be enjoyed to the fullest (in my opinion) and I can't see how aging it even longer would change the flavor/make it better. After the first few sips, the taste gets a little monolithic, but it's still appealing. Kudos to DFH for giving it a shot.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,lechroy,2.08,"Love the rich deep mahogany color of this brew. A brown top with long legs to match. Awesome. But that's where the goodness ends. A beer that is overpowered and buttered with Palo Santo wood is one that attacks the palette. Not a fan of the hints of sweetness here either. Mouthfeel was average, but feeling over carbonated for this suite of flavors. Overall a disappointment for me. The 12 alcohol on top of all this just makes this whole brew seem like a marketing joke.

10099,33832,Phocion,3.95,"Pours into a pint glass dark brown with no transparency. Small but stubborn creamy light brown head that holds good lacing.  Aroma has a healthy malt selection. Chocolate, dark fruit, toffee, and brown sugar. Somewhat doughy yeasts with a definite hint that this thing is 12% ABV. Slightly woody scent when I look for it, but not quite what I had anticipated; however, I have no idea what Palo Santo is supposed to smell like, so maybe I'm confusing it with the malts.  The taste is definitely also full of malts. Nutty and chocolatey, with a strong dose of alcohol and slightly sour yeasts. The woody flavor is a little more prevalent in my mouth than it was in my nose. Sweet but also a bitter dark chocolate/coffee flavor. Nice balance on the malts.  Full-bodied and with decent carbonation as well as a warming sensation from the alcohol.

10099,33832,Durge,3.97,"A dark brown brew with a fair light brown cover and modest lacing. The aroma suggests a light citrus hop over malty licorice. Nice. The flavorm comes on with much the same in addition to some very definitive raisin. It's pretty intense with malt and an almost minty licorice idea with a vanilla alcohol edge. It's near full bodied, somewhat cloying in its intense combination of sweetness and tasteful bitterness. Carbonation is mild and drinkability is marginal due to the thick character and alcohol presence. There's a slight peaty, almost seaweed-like base in the malt side of this quality brew. A real tasty treat but not something for the sessioning.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Nesued,4.45,"Have enjoyed this beer so many times, it's about time I give it a formal review. Can't get it in Columbia, so whenever I travel to where DFH is available I'm sure to pick up at least one four-pack.  Appearance - Poured a deep onyx. Fine dark tan, almost mocha colored head formed slowly as I poured. Nice 1.5-finger head rounded out my Old Rasputin pint glass. Yes, I should have used my DFH snifter, but that would have been pretentious...no? As the head receded, lacing coated the sides of my glass as a flannel blanket would keep your toes warm during a cold winter evening.  Smell - So, this is what Palo Santo wood smells like. Always wondered.... The nose is lively, almost fruity with a melon aroma (about the best I could classify what I'm smelling). Exotic would be another, woody would be too obvious. Some undertones of malt and a sweet component as well. Very inviting.  Taste - Starts with a deep malt presentation as you would expect from a base brown ale. The wood-aging lends a ""warming"" (best I can describe) contribution that makes the taste richer and fuller. The middle brings some hops to the party but it's not detracting nor acts as a cleansing agent. It's dry, it's roasted, it's dense but not overly complex. You know what you are getting here. Some fruity notes to give some balance. 12% ABV? Not by my reckoning. You get a hint, but not a big boozy presentation. Well done.  Mouthfeel - Smooth would best describe this mouthfeel. Is this an understatement? Sure, but I'm about the beer, not the words. This coats your tongue and gives meaning to the the word ""lush"". The carbonation is lighter than expected, meaning this is ""all beer all the time"" giving the body to this offering.  Drinkability - To take a brown ale, age it in wood barrels and have something like this come out is true artistry. This tastes like a bourbon-barrel-aged offering, but it isn't. Drink it close to room temp and you will enjoy it as the flavors further opens up. The presentation, the flavors, the sipping quality of this beer makes me come back to it on both chilly evenings and non-chilly evenings alike. One of my ""top 3 beers"" from DFH.

Smells like booze - the alcohol comes through in the smell as much as, if not more than, it does in the taste. Ultra malty beer with maybe a touch of caramel. The label mentions something about vanilla, but I think that gets quickly picked up by the more molasses-y tastes. Sweet leather, that might be a good way to describe it. Maybe not. The paolo santo wood notes come through though, quite strong.

10099,33832,beerdrinker123,4.5,"This beer pours an opaque black with a good amount of late-forming creamy tan head that lingers around for a while and leaves some pretty heavy lacing.  On the nose I can pick up on some hops, fig and other dark fruits, plus some sweet vanilla and coffee that comes in at the end. Very complex, overall fairly sweet smelling, not too boozy smelling, I only pick up a tiny bit of alcohol at the end.  Flavor wise this is really complex just like the smell, I feel like the alcohol is really well masked in this. There is a bitter dominance in this brew, but there are some delicate sweet flavors that come and go in the middle. The most prevalent thing to me is a roasted coffee flavor, along with some fig and some sweet sugary hints.  This beer has a really interesting mouthfeel, its slick and oily, and also has a moderate chewyness to it, but finishes on the thin side. It leaves an interesting wet feeling in your mouth aftwards then warms you up from the high abv.  I found this beer very drinkable and easy to sip on without hesitation.

Appearance: Palo Santo Marron pours out a very dark brown; about as dark brown as you can get without moving into the totally black end of the color spectrum. About a finger of light mocha colored head forms. Retention is okay, and lacing is very good.  Smell: Whew, a ton of complexity in this beer. Coffee, light smoke, fig, raisin, wood, and a bunch of vanilla. Great on the nose.  Taste: I must say, I'm a gigantic fan of this beer. A touch of smoke, coffee, caramel, slight dark fruits, woody quality, and a ton of vanilla all combine for a great flavor.  Mouthfeel/Drinkablility: This beer is slightly over medium bodied with incredibly fine carbonation. Super smooth and creamy; I don't think a brown ale gets any better in this category.

S - Quick scent of alcohol in the nose followed by deep sweet dark malts. There is a roasted (near burnt) sweetness to it. Not coffee exactly but rumors of coffee. The whole thing, while not fruity, is suggestive of candied fruits; acidic sumatran grounds.  T - Again, alcohol (and its relaxing vapors) up front. Brown sugar or perhaps burnt nun's candy. The dark malts are too roasted to be caramel but the sweetness has a smoothness to it, just under the sharpness of acidic roasts. There are moments of chocolate in here but so indirect that it might be flavor matrixing on my part. Any hops/bitterness is minimal and overshadowed by the acidity of the malts anyway. The finish has a classic wood/nutty brown ale flavor.  M - A robust medium, exceptionally smooth for the ABV %.

The carbonation was minimal and the bubbles struggled their way to the top.  S: I think you can smell how big this beer is. Plainly woody with some nuttiness to it, not overly complex.  T: As I first sipped this I thought it was a simple brown, but it is more complicated as it finishes. Definitely some caramel and a slight bit of leather.  M: Smooth and heavy, some velvet/syrup to it. It lingered in my mouth for a while.  This combined great with my shepherd's pie dinner - both were very substantial.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Kinsman,3.56,"Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights that turns into a solid black once it fills the glass. Nutty brown colored head with a creamy texture leaving behind a semi-sticky lace.  Aroma is heavy on the malt characters with some bready and chocolate or brown sugar sweetness mixed in with a strong dose of vanilla. A mild alcohol presence suggests this one is a bit boozy.  Lots of malt flavors going on here, reminiscent of many doppelbocks. Chocolately and caramel sweetness with some tart fruit flavors too. Not much of a roasted character for such a dark ale which I'm kind of missing because it's almost too sweet. Some woody accents but I'm not sure what the Palo Santo does that is any different from the more typical oak. Finshes with a lingering alcohol presence that makes this one a little too hot.  Thick, chewy, and creamy mouthfeel really compliments the flavor well and it gets better as it warms.  Overall the cloying sweetness of this makes this a suitable desert beer for some but certainly not something you could have more than one of in a night. I'll let my other bottle sit in the cellar for a long time and then revisit, four months old seems a bit too hot for my liking.  Edit to add: Having a second bottle from the same batch a week later. This one sat at room temp for a few hours before I opened it up and I'm enjoying it quite a bit more as the sweetness does not seem as cloying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

S: Slight boozy aroma, brown sugar, barely and a woodsy aroma waffs up to my nose,  T: A little heat, but age has weakened it. Vanilla, wood and sweet caramel/brown sugar.  M: Medium body brew, almost like a stout but not as creamy. Really enjoying this as I sip this.  D: Great sipper! No need to rush this one.

Small hint of alcohol at the end  M: Medium-bodied with a small amount of carbonation. I wish it was a little thicker, but the carbonation is perfectly balanced. It feels buttery as it coats the mouth, but with a little bite of alcohol  O: Very heavy and flavor-intense beer, great for sipping after dinner. I dont think I could drink more than one 12oz bottle at a time. I'd also like to add that this beer feels and tastes more like an imperial stout than a brown ale, and if you enjoy a good stout then you will love this beer.

Aromas of bourbon and booziness are prevelant, smells like the inside of a barrel maybe? I don't know but the tastes like it was aged in a bourbon barrel and after the initial alcohol-y pow you get from it, there is a delicious barleywine with booze covered dried fruits. Definitely an alcohol driven beer at 12 percent. Thats true for most good barleywines of course though. Creamy mouthfeel backed by mild carbonation and an alcohol twinge.

S: A lot of sweet malt, molasses, figs, a touch of vanilla, and a very faint aroma of what reminds of crusty banana peel; not the huge aroma I was expecting, though; considering the abv, not much hotness on the nose.  T: Wow, rich maltiness... caramel sweetness; toasted dark bread; sugary molasses; hard to believe this is 12%... crazy; although subdued by the big malt bill, hops more than hold their own, as there is a nice touch of bitterness on the finish.  M: In a word... huge. Almost too huge. Syrupy, yet well carbonated. Mouthwatering. Fullest mouthfeel of any beer I've had.  D: A wonderful sipper, but the sweetness is a bit much for me, personally.

Darker than I expected.  Smelled like toasted wood. Not really a familiar smell.... maybe because it was a Paraguayan wood. Carmel.... molasses.... rummy fruit.  Very nice flavor. Wood.... roasted coffee. Caramel. Alcohol evident, especially in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel was creamy... strange. A blend of creamy and silky.  I only gave it a 4 for drinkability, only because you really couldn't have more than 1 or 2 of these at a time. It is in no way a reflection of the awesomeness that is this beer!

Very little head, about 1/4 inch, that quickly disappears.  S: Alcohol soaked dark fruits, molasses, wood tannins, smoke, roasted malts. The heavy alcohol scent reminds me of rum.  T: Fairly hot from the get go. I get the roasted malts and alcohol soaked dark fruits similar to a stout, but without the chocolate. There's a lot of wood tannins, not quite oak, and some smokiness as well. Decent amount of sweetness is something akin to molasses and toffee. There's a little bit of vanilla, almost a hint at bourbon in the background. I'm pretty impressed not only at the complexity, but the balance. Finish is toffee, vanilla, and wood. While the alcohol is a bit hot, it's not as overbearing as a lot of high ABV beers.  M: Medium to low carbonation (I've been doing a god bit of swirling), fairly full body with plenty of viscosity. Seems very smooth and goes down easier than 12%ABV should.  D: As mentioned above, I found this a lot easier to drink than similar high gravity beers.

Alot of wood, and malts. Not up to par with the smell, but still very appealing.  M - Good consistency, not too thick. Nice boozy coating.  D - One is enough, which is fine.

10099,33832,thebrood1987,4.82,"I get that creamy caramel dark roasted fruity smell I guess from the hops and palo santo wood? plus some earthy wood and vanilla in the back. This is exactly how the brewery describes it. The taste is very thick and creamy with that Scottish ale caramel quality to it with that dark roasted malt and then ending with a subtle vanilla that mixes in with the chocolate type tastes and with the oak sharp wood taste. It also has a bit of hop that mixes in with the wood taste as well.  There are so many flavors in this beer it will never get boring. You also get some alcohol burn as well. Make sure you let it warm a bit to get all the flavors and settle the alcohol burn which isn't bad at all. It reminds me of their Indian Brown ale in the sense that if you ever had it you will recognize some qualities of that in this one...except this is way stronger and potent. That woody aftertaste is so good and mixes in with the thick mouthfeel perfectly.  I'm surprised that I can actually taste some hops in there as well especially when it states that it's a malt beverage. Don't let anyone tell you this beer doesn't have hops in it... they say it in their Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron documentary video on youtube that they use Glacier, Palisades and another hop that I can't remember.

Average to good lacing.  Smell - Smells more like a stout than an ale. I get hints of coffee; but they are overpowered by the smell of ethanol. A slight bourbon smell as well.  Taste - A very rich, crisp, bourbony, chocolaty coffee brown ale. A strong swallow that is always much anticipated as the alcohol rests in your mouth. It is a little tangy at times with quite a strong ABV.  Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A little unnerving and unpleasent alcohol taste that can be a little overwhelming. It had some deep chocolate tones at times as well.  Verdict - I have had this twice now; once bottled and once on-tap. I wasn't a huge fan of it either time.

The taste was a malty creamy sweet with notes of coffee, caramel and was a tad woody at first and finished sweetly-bitter and had nice notes of coffee and vanilla with mild alcohol aftertaste. The flavor lingered for a little while which let one enjoy the sweet woody coffee taste just a little longer.

Yeah, decent but a bit strong.  Taste isn't quite as strong, but has a robustness to it that is quite welcome. Caramel malt on the front with lots of cocoa-rich chocolate as it reaches the mid-palate, gathering hints of cherry and coconut on the way, to a small extent. Gets a slight sour spice edge late-mid with touches of liqueur, kirsch and maybe some aniseed and black pepper. Yeah, it's not bad, but a definite intensity to its flavour that keeps my enjoyment from frothing at my mouth.  A decent texture, smooth but a bit of boozey warmth to the back.

Rich toasted caramel is so thick and enveloping, i remember other bottles having a stronger woody note, but this bottle is kinda fainter but still there lightly. After taking a sip the alcohol presents itself not only in the flavors but now in the aroma also, looked and this is a 5 month old bottle so rather fresh. Warming it has a bit of a rough edge but is very enjoyable, it does smooth out with a bit more time i remember. There are some powdered coco and blackberry notes in here too that are very intriging.

10099,33832,JMad,4.23,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a glass snifter...  The liquid is black opaque with a thick tan head.  I smelled smoke, dark chocolate, wood and just a hint of alcohol.  When I took a sip I noticed bitter dark chocolate, black coffee, some warming alcohol and wood.  The beer is thick and heavy with perfect carbonation, with a dry finish.  This drinks pretty easy for such a high abv.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,readbaron,4.17,"Pours out like a stout - inky black with a slight mocha head.  Smells intoxicating - sweet dark fruit - and a somewhat tropical wood - palo santo, I imagine - possibly a hint of licorice underneath. Plenty of cereal malts as well. A bit of alcohol too.  Taste is not quite as rich as the aroma indicates. There's a very nice blend of sweetness and wood with a vigorous malt backbone - but the wood and alcohol are a bit overpowering. I bet this one would age really well. I'll probably plan to do that with the other bottles. Still - an unusual and very tasty beer. Glad I picked it up.  Mouthfeel is very good. Nicely carbonated - creamy and smooth. Finishes relatively dry for how sweet it is.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,shir0043,3.85,"Sent as an extra from maddog, big thanks!  Hard pour yielded a big 2"" beige head which dissipated in minutes. The color reminds me more of an imperial stout than a brown ale.  The smell light and composed of wood, brown sugar, roasted grains, and alcohol.  Taste is very unique for a big 12% ABV beer. Majority of the taste is wood but not the typical oak. This wood is not as acidic and complements the big beer very nicely. The wood flavor is followed by a familiar brown ale flavor, then hot with the alcohol. Surprisingly dry for a big beer.  Mouthfeel is very nice. Bigger and thicker than a standard brown, nearing a nice imperial stout.  Overall I'm very happy to have tried this beer and hope to have it again in the future, next time with some age on it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,crossovert,3.97,"12 oz bottle bottled on 12/06/10.  IT pours inot my snifter a dark brown, pretty much black with a foamy tan head that sticks for a nice bit of time and leaves delicate lacing.  The smell is a bit alcoholic with a good whiff but it also has some unique wood tones to it. I love exotic wood aged beers and this one in particular has a nice quality to it. There is also some roasted flavors and chocolate in the smell.  The flavor also has a major dose of wood and alcohol. The wood provides some tannic and almost spicy notes. The alcohol meld with the sweetness of the malts for a warming overtone. In between thsi is loads of dark chocolate with a moderately sweet dry finish.  They packed a lot of flavor into this one and although it is a bit sweet and cloying, the wood mellows it and it becomes a fine beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,sprucetip,4.17,"Had this for the first time a week ago, on tap, thanks to Ryan, Leigh, and Zach having procured it for the Lion's Pride. But this review is based on a bottle bought since then. I liked the draft version better. The sample this review is based on has been in the bottle for just about 3 months.  Some light gets in around the edges, but it's darker than chestnut brown, and quite active. Fizzy, thin, mocha colored head fades fast and doesn't any lacing to speak of.  Smell starts out really woody. Chocolate and vanilla like malty notes come next. I can feel some boozy heat, but not that much, and I don't really smell it.  The wood is prominent up front, and is joined by mild hop bitterness, malty flavors and fleeting sweetness in the middle. There is some vanilla and chocolate like character in the malty part, and something vinous that I can't quite identify. Bitterness returns for the finish, but stronger. Booze is noticeable.  Low/medium carbonation, full body feels rich briefly then dries out really fast. Finishes dry and a little bitter.  I definitely liked this better on tap, but it's a very good beer in either context. The woody character comes through strongly in the smell and taste, and there are some other complexities as well. But this bottle sample is just a little too dry and bitter to call wicked smooth. I wonder how it ages. If I had reviewed what I had on tap I would surely have scored this higher.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,feylure,4.45,"I have been intrigued by this beer ever since I saw an interview with Caligione about how it is made. Bottled on 11/10/10.  Appearance is dark. Almost pitch black in fact with a brown hint around the rim and very little carbonation.  Smell is an amazing dark malt and wood aroma.  Taste is unique. It may be a American Brown Ale, but this is a new flavor. Like the smell, it's quite dark and malty, but the wood finally takes form with a characteristic quite different from oak or any other wood-aged beer I've tried; very caramel and vanilla and complex spices. The brew is also very well balanced.  Mouthfeel is extremely full-bodied beginning to end.  For 12% abv, I find this quite drinkable. It's not overpowering given it's great balance of flavor.  This beer is expensive, but I find it to be worth it. You're really purchasing this for the wood the beer has been aged on. Indigenous only to Paraguay and brought to Delaware by Dogfish (costing $140,000 for one tank according to Caligione), it's the dominating factor in the brew, and that's why I find it to be such a unique beer.  Cheers!  ps - Hopefully in the future we can see Dogfish make a beer as intense as the 120 Minute IPA or World Wide Stout aged with this Palo Santo wood. Just wish thinking!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,lacqueredmouse,3.73,"Pours a very heavy deep brown, almost black, but with an edging to it that suggests something other than a stout. Head is filmy but supple, leaving a few speckles of lace, if nothing more. Very heavy and thick body, which I guess is to be expected in a beer weighing in at 12% ABV. Look pretty good.  Roasted, but surprisingly light nose, with some notes of crushed undergrowth, but minimal black charred characters. Instead, there's a light astringency and a leavened almost chemical character, that smells like old camera film.  Taste is smooth, but surprisingly light, with a little roasted grain and slight chilli flavour, if not the spice. Slight nuttiness on the back which if anything leavens it more, giving a light character to the dark flavours.  Feel is light. It doesn't match with the flavour.  Nice. Nutty and interesting, with some unusual flavours. Hints of spice and a really surprisingly well subdued alcohol character. Indeed, 12% is a shock when you discover the ABV.  A decent brew. It doesn't do anything astounding, however.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,xnicknj,3.78,"on tap at the brewpub - review from notes  Pours a deep, rich brown color with an almost black coffee brown head. Fades out with barely any retention or lacing on the glass.  Richer tones in the nose with raisins, dates and roasted charred malts. Slight caramel sweetness with earthy wood.  Some candied dark fruit up front with fruit sweetness driven by dates and raisins. Caramel and syrupy sweet flavors. Oak smoothness yet earthy, rich, and robust overall. Slight vanilla with a smack of booze towards the finish.  Full bodied, sticky and chewy, lighter carbonation. Pretty drinkable considering the richness and abv.

10099,33832,DerekP,3.92,"Notes from 1/29/2011  My wife compiled a six pack of different brews for my birthday and included this curious and mysterious brew.  Dark brown in appearance, nearly black. Dark nougat head. Aroma similar to Cabernet Sauvignon, not that I'm a wine expert. Fruity. Cocoa nibs. Pealed apples (green). Woodsy aromas remind me of olive oil. Fierce alcohol & acidity presenting itself in the midst of a nuance of smell variables. Sticky like jam hands (smell still).  Man, oh, man! Alcohol up front (taste). Very warming. That it's aged on wood is clearly evident. Wife calls it ""salty"" (reluctantly tried it). The alcohol is upfront like I said, but warming as opposed to offensive & aggressive. Washes down smoothly. Nearly a wine, but with the body of a beer. Woodsy notes linger like reverberating chords.  Sip, sip, sip slowly. Any reasonable palate will only permit a savoring of this brew, not a fast, hasty finish. I find it hard to distinguish between the hops & alcohol in this brew as it carries so much depth, but they're both playing their part undoubtedly. Mouthfeel is warm like wine, but offers a broader body with far more discernible death.  Other than slowly sipping this for a cool 45-60 minutes, it almost has zero drinkability. The high alcohol content (12%) renders this brew an ""only one"" endeavor.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Aftertaste has a hint of chocolate in it  M/D: Thin but the ABV definitely comes through.

10099,33832,rpardon7,4.55,"Poured from the tap a dark ominous brown that could be called black. Small rose color in the bottom of your glass when held to the light, small one finger tight off white head that laced for most of the beer. Smell is roast malt, wood, dark fruit, cofee, chocolate hint of vanilla and a lingering warming alcohol. Taste is fantastic complexity, warm bittersweet chocolate with a bite of wood from the san palo wood, coffee and roast malt mix with sharp hops that fade into more roast and a sweet big malt bill finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and heavy very large body but fills the beer out nicely. Drinkability would be much higher if the abv weren't so high.

The alcohol comes through in the smell, however.  Taste- Very enjoyable taste. It has notes of spice and coffee. The alcohol comes through in the taste though, and that is a negative to me. Couldn't taste the vanilla that was supposed to be there, however.  Mouthfeel- This is a thick and creamy beer. I would not consider it a brown ale, however.  Drinkability- For such a high ABV, this is a very drinkable beer. Goes down smoothly.  Overall this is a decent beer, but I was expecting more from it. I was surprised how much of the alcohol came through in the smell and the taste, but other than that, this is a really good beer.

Taste/Mouthfeel: Nice sweet chocolate, caramel, and fruit to go with a hint of pine hops at the end. I mark some points off for the strange unpleasant bitter aftertaste. It's subtle but strong enough to take into consideration. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth.  Drinkability: Not overbearing despite the alcohol content. You don't really taste much of it so that helps.

Similar to oak but not as assertive.The wood barrels are more effident in the aroma then the taste itself. A full bodied beer here, which is slightly gritty.

10099,33832,damndirtyape,4.03,"Single bottle (no date I could find) poured into a Tulip glass.  Appearance: Pitch black on the table, and pretty much black when held up to the light as well. If I look close I can see some very dark cola brown at the edges at the top of the glass. The foam is a dark tan, but not very thick even when pouring. It's a ring around the edge and thin film across the top. There is very delicate lacing noted as I drink it down though.  Smell: Some definite vanilla and faint sweet smells. With some swirls I get some char and smoky smells as well.  Taste: Smooth caramel, roasted malts, and that hint of vanilla again up front, but then it moves into a hot alcohol note, some more roasted malt and sweet flavors, a hint of something woody, and then a lingering alcohol ""burn"", although that burn isn't as strong as what you get from a whiskey. Definitely has some bite to it. When first poured I can taste some char/smoke/ash flavors every now and then, but as it warms up these mostly go away.  Mouthfeel: Mild carbonation on the tongue, thick on the creamy side of things, and does leave some lingering sensation on the teeth.  Drinkability: Definitely a slow sipper due to the high ABV, and with the higher alcohol bite, I feel that this has to be paired with a meal, and the right meal at that. Stand alone it's a bit much and I seem to remember as a bit more drinkable when on tap. Not a bad beer at all - just something I have to pace myself on and ideally, I'd prefer to have something like this with something else to balance out the high alcohol content.

I didn't pick up many wood notes, but my palate might not br adjusted to those. This beer was crazy drinkable for the ABV. It hit a lot of great notes and it was definitely the better of the double browns I've had... even though I loved the (512) version.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Thanby,4.32,"Pours a nearly black garnet, hardly anything brown about it. A finger of smooth brown head that dies quickly and doesn't stick much.  Nose is robust with dark malts, molasses, mulled with black cherry, maybe even some impressions of strawberry, raisin, strong esters and very sweet. It's such a complex mass of malt, this is probably going to kick me in the face. The wood lends a smoky quality that sits on top of everything.  The first taste is wonderfully potent and complex. The smokiness is much more prominent, and it still has a huge malt body. The sweet, stickiness of molasses is prominent, and the dark fruit undertones are more noticeable too. The esters are also in full force, the ABV is felt as the body fades. Just a little spiciness in the beginning to break up the sweet malt. Someone mentioned a similarity to English barleywines, and I completely agree. Just a little tartness, and a huge aged malt body closely resemble that style, probably more-so than a brown ale.  Full body, a little chewy, and a sticky finish with lingering sweetness and alcohol vapor. Incredibly smooth and an absolute pleasure to drink. I wish I could have a constant supply because it is a gem of a beer.

A smokey, rich caramel / coffee taste with a solid kick of booze. The flavor reminds me of Irish Coffee. This is truly a remarkably complex and delicious beer.  M- Viscous and soft.

10099,33832,AgentMunky,4.43,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on 21 May 2010.  A: Easily the darkest brown ale I've seen. A huge two-finger head sits on the top, its constituent bubbles improbably fine. The colour, as far as I can tell, is black. Holding the glass up to a bare bulb only suggests shades of brown, and the beer remains perfectly opaque. Lacing feathers the sides of the glass.  S: Some caramel malts, light vanilla or jasmine, and perhaps a hint of citrus and hops. I'll assume the floral vanilla scents originate in the wood used for aging -- it reminds me of first-fill oak barrels used in whisky-making.  T: Holy cow, 'holy wood' indeed. This is simply marvellous. Wonderfully smooth and creamy, the beer is predominantly sweet -- vanilla beans, salted caramel, milk chocolate, buttered bread. The creaminess is also omnipresent, softening the taste and leaving an aftertaste like that of ice cream or desert cheese (I'm thinking of a certain soft ginger Stilton I once had). Some traces of alcohol, especially on the edges of the flavour or at the tail-end, but these only highlight Palo Santo Marron's virtues -- a little bite helps to even out the sweetness. The aftertaste is similar, but with a measure of nuttiness and trace bitter notes.  M: Creaminess is by far the dominate feel, and it succeeds splendidly. The velvety body slips through the mouth with the greatest of ease, offering only the gentlest caresses to mark its passing. I have to drink carefully, lest I take deceptively large sips. Mmmm.  D: Dangerously drinkable. Pair the surprising 12% with the sheer drinkability and soft mouthfeel of this beer, and I'm not sure I would it ever occur to me to stop drinking. I can't decide whether a 12 ounce bottling is prudent or tragic -- I want more. Absolutely recommended, and I hope to acquire another sooner rather than later.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

T - Charred woody malt, brown sugar, prune juice, dry roasted coffee beans, smokey cocoa, burnt maple, minor hints of vanilla extract. Bittering hops start in the middle and follow through to the finish. A robust woody note coats the entire mouth. Some perfume-like character toward the finish. Finishes slick but quickly dries out.  M - Full bodied, low carbonation, syrupy at times but dry at times as well. Alcohol doesn't show like it does in the aroma.  Very complex. Not as much vanilla as I thought would be there.

Excellent retention and lacing.  Smell - roasted coffee beans, smoky wood, brown sugar/molasses, and lots of alcohol  Taste - really quite interesting. I swear if I closed my eyes I would have said this was an imperial stout but hey they're the ones brewing it they can call it what they want. Sweet dark malt, toasted grains, and caramelized sugar up front. Lots of cooked brown sugar and molasses lending both sweetness and a touch of bitterness. A little astringent at the finish but pretty much sweet the whole way through. Fantastic IMHO.  Mouthfeel - Definitely heavy bodied with substantial carbonation for a 12% abv beer.

Appears viscous and oily like soy sauce, motor oil, or that stuff that turns people into Venom in the Spider-Man comics... which I do not read.  Smells of wood, smoky red wine, dark fruits, maybe some cocoa, and a little charcoal. Also something there I just can't describe, like a boozy perfumy thing that is very inviting. Reminds me of those classy ladies that hang around craps tables... except you can drink them.  Taste is smooth but smoky and woody at the same time. Mouthfeel is soft but has character. A solid beer all around and a very cool take on the style (or any style for that matter).  As I sip this dark concoction I pause to roast the recently departed Brewmasters, a show that had so much potential, if anything from Sam's endearing and likeable personality. But alas the powers that be (i.e., an ice cold bitch in a dark suit) have pulled the plug and moved on to other projects of less moral value and with fewer white rappers. So let us take a moment to bow our heads and remember the show about beer that finally got picked up by cable, only to be tossed around time slots and eventually killed, like our old friend Mr. Belvedere. Fare thee well Brewmasters, and may we perhaps be lucky enough to see your Season 1 DVD set in our Christmas stocking next year... along with some Burton Baton.

10099,33832,Pellinore1,4.13,"Pours deep, nearly opaque brown into a pint glass. A finger of caramel colored head slowly settles into some lacing and a nice cap.  From the moment you smell this beer, it is clear that this is no ordinary brown ale, not that I have a better category suggestion. Dark, slightly fruity malts lay the base for the aroma, and I seem to pick up some funky sour notes and a whiff of booziness. I am reminded of other wood-aged beers I have had, but not of oak.  After that range of smells, the complexity of the flavor is no surprise. Sweet malts hint of raisin and burnt sugar, but then are overtaken by vanilla, earthiness, and the very interesting wood flavors that make this beer so distinctive. It finishes with some alcohol warmth, and leaves some roasty bitterness on the tongue.  This beer is smooth and a bit thick. The feeling is pleasant, but the drinkability is limited by the booziness and the intensity of the flavor.

10099,33832,renniksdb,4.35,"This beer is very very dark and has a small, frothy brown head that sticks to the glass for a while. In wine terms, it would have great legs.  The aroma is strong. A sort of sweet vanilla. I know it notes this on the bottle, so I'm not revealing anything groundbreaking in saying so, but its true.  There's a slight bite to the fizz, and the beer is pretty full. The taste is almost too complex to describe, but in a good way. Starts off with a sweet, malty and maybe chocolaty flavor that builds after sipping. The vanilla is also still there. This is the kind of beer where the flavor engulfs your mouth and nose, probably due to the high alcohol content.  The finish is a mix of slight bitter hops and sweeter malt.  This is a very strong beer. It's also a beer that will warm you up considerably, boasting a 12% alcohol content. I'd suggest this with a pretty flavorful dish.  Though this is categorized as an ""American Brown Ale,"" I'd suggest it falls into a type of its own. Very unique. If you're used to drinking American Lager, you should probably try something a little lighter. But if you're seasoned, and if you really want to try a beer that you will remember, then go ahead and grab a Palo Santo.  **As a side note, I'm rating this beers drinkability as a 4.0 because though I surely enjoy one, and maybe two, this is not a beer to drink all night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

It's totally black with a milk chocolate crown. It comes to about three fingers in height. Retention is off the charts, the head just won't fade. Lacing is solid, but holding the beer back from true excellence. The nose is good, but could stand to be a bit more punchy. Lots of milk chocolate, and a hint of herb/spice in the background. I find a bit more going on on my palate, most notably some vanilla, though caramel also shows up. The slight warming sensation from thew alcohol folds in very nicely with the notes I'm getting from the herbs and spices from the hops (and possibly the wood). Palo Santo Marron is just as rich as I'd expect a 12%, all malt driven beer to be, which is extremely so. Carbonation is spot on, enough to cut through the heavy body, but still restrained enough to let the malt shine.

It is everything you have read; it is BIG, even at this alcohol level (which it hides pretty well until you get that warming down the pipe).  It is complex; the malt, wood of some new kind to me, some nuts and maybe who knows. And soon who cares?  Unlike most reviewers, I do the whole four-pack as a personal exercise from time to time. By the third bottle there is a bit of a lift-off to a special place where everything is really pretty O.K.; even really fine, I mean shit, I just don't care anymore about ""the little stuff"" (or the bigger stuff for that matter!)  It gets a bit spacey around the fourth and final bottle, and I pour and I sip and I thank God for the creative minds and the American spirit of entrepreneurship at Dogfishhead Brewing and I pray to Jesus that I don't have to answer any serious questions...

I had this first back in August on tap at the brewery, loved it, bought two 4-packs, and now I'm enjoying it as one of the first beers I've had in 2011. Sharing the 12oz, because it clocks in at 12% and that's a little heavy for my poor, abused, and hungover stomach.  It pours dark black with minimal head and brilliant lacing that retains throughout the drink. It smells according to the caramel and vanilla description - with vanilla being a little more prevalent. The smell is also definitely of wood, and unfortunately booze. When you sip it, there's definitely more of the caramel and malty sweetness, which helps contain the booze but doesn't rid the taste of it. It finishes crisp and clean, which is refreshing. Big and velvety in the palate, it's got a barrel-aged smoothness.  But still after 4+ months, this beer isn't what I remembered. But then again, that day was full of blissful August vacation excitement near the beach and relaxed. This time I'm in my living room a tad hungover at 6pm.  And maybe that's what these reviews all come down to in the end. Context. Regardless, this A+ has gone to an A- for me.

The taste is excellent, especially as the beer warms. Tastes of molases and raisins dominate along with brown sugars, caramel malts, and a slight lingering alcohol burn.

Barely any lacing and carbonation is almost nonexistant after a few minutes.  S - Massive aroma: raisin, fig, grape, wood, molasses, burnt sugar.  T - A fuckton of charred wood - this flavor permeates all stages of the taste. I'm definitely getting the feeling this wood was roasted over an open fire. Raisin, slight vanilla, chocolate, and some residual malt sweetness. The finish ends with plenty of char and dryness from the wood.  M -- Quite viscous with low carbonation (to be expected)  D - At a year+, this has really turned into a nice beer.

A wooden smokey flavour is also present on the finish. Complex and delicious.  M - This one is pretty thick with only some fine carbonation on the body, it goes down pretty smooth and the higher ABV gives you a tickle of a burn on the finish.

10099,33832,GoatmanBrewsMD,3.16,"Great story behind the beer and if you get a chance to go to the brewery you can see the Palo Santo wood tank they use to ferment this beer in. Its made entirely of the wood and cost a lot of money to be built and brought in from South America. A very cool concept. They say they brew this beer just using a standard brown ale recipe and the wood tank provides the rest of the ""extra"" flavors.  Had this beer at the brewery poured into a 6 oz plastic cup  A- I love dark beers! This one was an interesting dark brown with mild hints of ruby red when held up to the light. The head is tan and looked great in my plastic cup.  S- Good aroma. Hints of chocolate from the roasted malts and caramel and vanilla from the Palo Santo wood. I could also get some whiffs of alcohol not surprising coming from a 12%.  T- Nice initial taste. The vanilla and caramel flavors really come through. The roasted malt flavors kick in a give your mouth the flavor of a stout and then the wood notes are detected. The after taste of the beer is a little more ""in your face"" than I prefer and is kind of off putting to me.  M- Very chewy is the only way I can describe it. Its not heavy but not light on the palate either.  D- Its something to try. Not a session beer and might take awhile for some individuals to drink. It will not appeal to everyone.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Not the blackest beer ever, but no light getting through, either  S- A little cocoa, maybe whiff of black cherry and anise. Cinnamon-y.  T- There's an unusual flavor somersault in the mouth. The first impression is very stout-like but this quickly gives way to a rolling sting of what I can only describe as a singularly unique wood flavor. It's reminiscent of cedar and charcoal and has a spiciness I can't really put my finger on. Never had anything quite like it. ABV very well hidden.  M- On the lighter side w/o being dry. This beer goes down every smooth.  D- I'm glad this beer comes in four-packs and I look forward to trying another one in a year or so.

Pours a deep brown basically black with a small espresso swirl head and some small fleeting lace. The aroma is raisin and plum with a fair bit of booze in a rich almost wine like way, not like the cheap vodka booze aroma you get from many high gravity beers. This blends well with the whole bouquet and compliments the notes of vanilla and aged rum. The flavor is nutty and a bit spicy, quite a good bit like the spices in anchor Christmas ale (woody, zesty, potpourri like in a way) As the glass progresses dark fruits show up with some nice roastiness and a good bit of heavily toasted French oak.

Taste has a major roasty malt, cinnamon, molasses, and definite alcohol.  Mouthfeel is heavy, full, oily, sticky, not really enough carbonation. Too sticky to be much better than a 3.5.

S: Aroma is of, to me, a cedar tree. This must be the Palo Santo barrels. Musty, dank, rich, roasty and sweet.  T: Taste is of a brown ale but slightly sweet and slightly sour--overridden by earthy. It reminds me of being in the woods, and cold. And there's a hint of bite from the alcohol.  M: Syrupy, sticky feel, but thin. Tingles the tongue. More oxidized than you might expect a beer that otherwise leaves a syrupy feel on the mouth. The taste and feel linger long.  D: Unlike many high abv beers, Palo Santo goes down easy.

The taste is very, very woody. It tastes like it's a cedar aged American strong ale. It has good smokiness as well. It's very Beer Geek Bacon like in everything but body. It's definitely thicker.

The taste has certain characteristics of the nose with a light but defined oak flavor with some lighter alcohol and vanilla notes. There is a boat load of darker roasted grains you do not detect in the nose. Burnt grainy malts and dark chocolate, pretty freakin' delicious if I do say so...  The mouthfeel is full but with adequate carbonation, solid, but never syrupy or cloying despite the 12% ABV. Overall this is one of the top offerings from Dogfishhead, which is saying quite a lot because they churn out a pretty solid portfolio of brews.  UPDATE: Should definitely be consumed young in my opinion. Just sampled a year old version and all of the above flavors were much more muted and less enjoyable.

Not a lot of stick, but this a pretty heavy beer.. Smell is sweet and medicinal. ""Dark"" comes to mind in both fruit and malt. Definitively sweet, but with a rich, mocha dessert-like taste that really compliments the complex woody qualities. The feel reinstates this, and as much as there thinness and heat to the equation, just as much is taken out in the dryness and flavor extract qualities on the finish.

A ring of head around the glass, and some lacing.  The smell is just awesome. Dark fruits such as plums and raisins, figs, brown sugar, woody vanilla and earthy chocolate. Smells like a blend of a great Belgian quad, a bit of imperial stout, and an oak aged old ale. Man, it's just awesome.  Taste does not quite live up to the smell. The fruit and sugar and vanilla are pushed back by the wood, which is bitter and drying. It is an odd wood, which I can't quite describe. It almost reminds me of really old hops, in that it is bitter, but a bit fruity. The taste is still quite interesting, and I still like it.

Head disappears at the speed of knots, but with the ABV of this beer, it is not surprising. However, it has excellent lacing. The aroma is a mix of cherries, wood, a hint of vanilla and alcohol. The taste is a complex blend of woody, vanilla, cherries, with a finish that leaves a smoked woody taste. The most amazing part of this beer is how well the ABV is masked. This is one potent beer, be warned- try to avoid drinking more than one beer in a sitting. You won't realize when you might end up getting knocked out. This brew definitely packs a punch, and the best or the worst part is, you won't realize when it hits you. Highly recommended, one of those brews that you MUST try at least once, maybe even twice, maybe multiple times, but most certainly once in your life. Highly recommended. A complex, solid brew from Dogfish head, one of my favorite breweries.  6/4/2011 Aged this bottle for just over a year prior to opening. Very viscous and dark as night. No head whatsoever, but a steady trickle of bubbles surfacing constantly. Aroma is sweet with intermittent hints of wood and vanilla. The woody essence is also prominent in the taste with hint of sweetness coming through. Layers of complex tastes/flavors with every sip. Definitely gets more complex with age. I have a few more bottles that I will crack in due time. I can only imagine this ale will get more and more complex with age.

10099,33832,Morey,4.05,"This beer poured an opaque dark brown color with a light brown head that actually has some raspberry colored tones around the the outer rim. Head settled to a thin lace rather quickly, but still has some nice retention following each sip.  Aroma is filled with earthy, woody, and chocolate smells.  Taste is a nice mixture of the same. You also get a bit of alcohol burn/taste in the middle, but it doesn't linger into the finish. There is also a nice hop bitterness in there as well. Borderline complex and a joy to drink. I personally feel this should be in the ""American Strong Ale"" category.  Full bodied mouthfeel. You can almost chew on it. Moderate to Soft carbonation which works perfectly here.  I could imagine the possibility of having one more, and that's about it. But for the alcohol and style, this is pretty drinkable.  Morey's Bottom Line: A solid sipper to say the least. Although this is a beer I would probably only want to drink in the fall/winter months. If you're looking for a nice sipper, but are tired of Barleywines and DIPA's...this just might be your huckleberry.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,jangotaurus,3.36,"Appearance: Dark brown almost black. Thin brownish ribbon of head  Smell: Strong aromas of Coffee and Red wine with a slight smell of chocolate. Also an initial smell of vinegar of ammonia that passes once it has had time to breath.  Taste: Syrupy mouth feel with only slight carbonation. The initial taste across the palate is coffee and dark chocolate, there is a lingering sweet flavor. You will also find a woody flavor (a product no doubt of the massive wooden vat this is brewed in) there is also a strong smack of alcohol.  This beer doesn't throw any punches and doesn't hide what it is. It is very robust and strong and is not something to drink every day, this is definitely one to savor and experience. I don't really like the syrupy mouthfeel but it makes up for it with lots of flavor. The one flavor drawback is the strong alcohol aftertaste. Otherwise it is a very enjoyable beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Very hard to see anything through this, no apparent carbonation.  S: Get some caramel and toffee in the nose. The booze is very noticeable as well. Some light woody characters as well, but not to much.  T/M: Get the alcohol right up front, however then a nice roasted character is present. There is a certain woody character to the taste, like food cooked on wood planks. However, it is not that dominant. For me to the booze fades as I get further into the glass making it more enjoyable. Covers the mouth and is very much like a syrup.  D: Not meant to be gulped down, however a nice brew non the less.

Earthy dark fruits and woodsy. It seems that no two sniffs from one glass come out the same. Intriguing.  T: Malty. Raisins and molasses as well. It changes on your palate much the smell does. To me it finished with a slight bit of vanilla and atypical wood flavors.  M: Very round, coats the mouth nicely. The right amount of body for this ABV.

The vanilla also comes out in the nose as does the roasted chocolate. Big flavor. A little vanilla and unsweetened chocolate malt to start. Then the big wood flavor takes over. Huge roasted notes as well as some alcohol to finish. Taste reminds me of a camp fire. Well done.

Smell is sweet and alcoholic. There is a lot of vanilla in the nose. The smell of vanilla extract and alcohol come together to create a bourbon scent that is very pleasing. Smells exactly like Jack Daniels oak bbq chips. There is toasted malts, berries and alcohol present in the taste. The sweet malts are right up front hinting to you flavors of berries. Then the alcohol comes in and dominates, then ends with a nice toasted coffee finish. Has a smooth mouthfeel. Its a little thiner than i anticipated but not bad. Carbonation is just right, not too much not too little. I don't think i could drink more than two of these. Its a delicious beer but at 12% wow. This is a big beer. Its a sipper for sure.

Although you get hints of everything you smelled ther eis a woodsy oak ages taste to the brew. Very earthy. At one point it tastes like newly laid woodchips smell. Very uniqe progression to this beer from first to last sip. Almost overpowering at times. The hints of burning leaves is present in the taste. Very complex, like nothing i have tried before.

10099,33832,tonymoore,4.21,"First, on the show Brew Masters this past week, Sam from DFH basically confirmed what I've been thinking all along about this beer: it is an Imperial Stout and not really a brown ale. (It was the imperial stout they used in creating Bitches Brew.)  That aside, this pours black and heavy with a great and lasting head (although this really seemed to depend on the glass I used; I'll assume the clean glasses are the default and kept the head intact). The alcohol is front and center at first, but it gets forgotten along the way under chocolate and pine and SMOKE.  The smoky flavor is just great and is the long and short of this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

S: The first thing that hit me was rich, dark molasses. Then sweet toasted malt and vanilla.  T: From the aroma and appearance, I anticipated a thick, hearty, possibly sweet concoction and was not disappointed. The molasses, roasted malt and vanilla mixed with wood, caramel and chocolate.  M: Very thick and smooth, consistent with the taste and smell. Not particularly carbonated.  D: An incredible beer, definitely making my favorites list. Should be enjoyed slowly and decidedly.

10099,33832,cosmicevan,4,"A - Poured an almost black deep brown or purple with virtually no head or lacing into an oversized snifter. S - Yep, it's a DFH extreme beer. That unmistakeable mix of alcohol and syrupy hops. Smells thick if that makes sense. More like a SBDA than a Brown Ale. Dark fruits and sweetness. T - I have the indian brown ale still fresh on my palette. Interesting. Kind of like a nutty milkshake. Nutmeg and plums. Pretty sweet. Not as much of a mess as some of the other extreme DFHs I've had (and I know, some people love em...they are just too heavy and thick for me). This one was a little more tolerable and even enjoyable. M/D - Wanted to try it since I love the Indian Brown so much. Glad I did. Probably won't come back, but ya never know. I thought I'd never come back to a 120 or WWS and I have.

10099,33832,ZorPrime,3.92,"Thanks to liamt07 for sending me this beer my way. Wasn't requested but he felt I would enjoy it. He wasn't wrong.  The beer sticker says it is a brown ale... wow I'm surprise to find that it is very dark brown. In fact, the color is not brown but black! No head. The aroma is chocolate and roasted malts. I get some alcohol in the nose too with some cherry. I would say this is more imperial stout smell than brown ale. No hazelnut, which I was expecting from a brown ale. Not bad, just surprising.  Taste wise, this beer is intense (like many dogfish head brews). It is warm due to the level of alcohol. Get some faint notes of vanilla with some chocolate. Complex beer, this is. Full bodied and a little bit creamy. This is truly a sipping beer. Light bitterness but it lingers in the mouth.  Would drink only one per session, but goes down quickly.  A very interesting beer that all should try at least one time. I would pick some more for those dark, cold winter days to come.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Kind of reminded me of a Weihenstephaner Korbinian (one of my all time favourites) amped up to around 12!  Big and slightly chewy, bordering on Imperial stout territory but with a balance that is impeccable! I didn't even notice the 12% ABV until after I had polished my second.  Dark stout like appearance but the nose doesn't give you the whole story of what an amazing beer this is. I really think that I am in love with this beer.

Poured a one inch mocha colored head. So thick and creamy like a liquid pudding.  Smell- Yep thats a big hint of oaky vanilla to me. I likey. Smells of burnt oaky caramel as well not a candied smell just stronger, more agressive.  Taste- I have been waiting a long time for this beer and well, its damn good. Its complex, upfront, agressive, mild and palatable all at the same time for 12%. Very rich and tasty.  Mouth- Complex, light, heavy, sweet, thick. It drinks a lot different than a lot of other beers. I like it a lot.  Drink- Wasn't too overpowering and if it wasnt the 3rd beer of the night. I'd run to the store for more.

I think this is the most anticipated show for beer geeks ever  A- appearance is a dark as night color that looks almost stout like. There is a good head of foam that disappears ever so slightly. An interesting piece of this is that the lacing engulfs the sides of the glass. Big time stick  S- a unique flash of sweet vanilla that is surrounded by brown sugar and dark fruit. The final aspects of the scent lie with the strength of the wood scent and alcohol. The wood is overwhelming in the end. I love this because of the uniqueness  T- sweet brown sugar that is dosed with the wood component and followed with vanilla syrup. Palo Santo has a one of a kind taste. Everyone though the alcohol almost the star of the show, it's still fantastic! What are a complex brew  M- full bodied, creamy, syrupy, laced with flavor. This brew has got it  D- sip this!

10099,33832,Spider889,4.33,"On tap at Bodega, wow what a pleasant surprise when I arrived!!  Arrives a thin black as night beer with a small but stout mocha cream head. Nice and lacy - left a nice cheesecloth impression on my glass.  Smells sweet and of dark malts and dark fruit - raisins and dried dates with burnt coffee impressions.  The taste is robust and complex. Wood! I saw the Palo Santo wood barrels at the brewery and the wood itself is still green, the grain is complex. Some boards were dark and almost brown, while others intermingled between green oak colors and various shades of brown. Supposedly the wood is used for its flavoring characteristics in South America. Never has wood left such a unique and lovely impression on the beer kept inside!  The wood leaves soft earthy and herbal notes that last long into the finish and round out the harsh alcohol of the beer. The beer imparts robust syrupy dark malts, fennel, and roasted coffee flavors. Brown ale? This feels more like a stout to me...  The mouthfeel is amazing. It's almost like licking a wet board, freshly hewn from the live tree. There's a graininess reminiscent of chewing on raw sugar cane, and I can feel all of the wonderful fibrous matter in the mouthfeel of this beer.  Despite the woodiness, the beer drinks insanely smoothly for 12%. It is a slight bit boozy, but it's not unbearable. The perfect beer to enjoy as the weather grows ever colder all around us.

10099,33832,beerdown77,3.58,"Anytime you have a beer this strong, there are a couple of things to expect going in: a lot of sugar, low carbonation, a general likeness to syrup or wine, and the inescapable presence of alcohol. That said, this was one of the better high proofers that I have tried. The carbonation was surprising recognizable, the barrel aged smokiness provided a good offset to the sweetness, and the boozy factor was not a deal breaker.

The bottle description doesn't exaggerate.  This is a beer that is to be sipped. Personally the first taste was a bit overwhelming but as it warms it becomes a bit more enjoyable to drink. However, eventually those sips became less and less enjoyable. The beer just goes bonkers after sitting and just becomes too much.  A surprisingly nice fizz of carbonation on the tongue. Thick body but not chewy.  Definitely a liquid meal. Too heavy in booze and body character.

There's a touch of chocolate but it seems very unbalanced.  The flavour is again, big and alcoholic with a lot of sweetness. There is a good amount of bitterness. The chocolate note is nice but this is more stout that brown ale. There is a touch of vanilla. This gets better as it warms which is nice and as the fruitiness comes out it becomes enjoyable.  The body is good with a medium body and moderate carbonation.  This is a hard beer to get around. The flavour is okay but the balance is all wrong and the alcohol too high.

10099,33832,ryantaussig,2.47,"A: Pours dark, almost like a stout. Head is disappointing at best. One finger lasted for about 30 seconds, giving way to a next-to-nothing lacing.  S: Alcohol and wood notes come thorough with slight bits of caramel and vanilla. Plenty of malt in the background. A few toasted notes perhaps, but very vague.  T: Alcohol is quite overpowering in this one and throws off the balance. It really doesn't taste like a brown ale. The malts are there and there is a slight level of hop to ""balance,"" but the alcohol comes in and throws it off. There is certainly a level of woodiness to it, giving slight caramel, and strong vanilla notes, but it's just not quite right.  M: Medium bodied like a brown ale should be. Slightly thin, but that is likely due to the high ABV. The carbonation is also a bit low, which is another likely contributer to the thinness. Has a level of creaminess and gives way to a bone dry finish.  O: Not quite the meal in a bottle that brown ales typically provide, but it's definitely a sipper.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Appearance- Showed up at the old table in a glistening tulip with a fluffy little white head. I know it's classified as a brown but it doesn't particularly look like one. It's mighty dark for a brown.  Smell- WOOD! (with other random smells pitched in such as a tantalizing vanilla, and warm booze)  Taste- Pretty gosh-darn delicious. It has the wood taste of the barrels but what really pops is the delicious vanilla. It hides the alcohol uncommonly well. Truly tasty.  Mouthfeel- The alcohol content (although masked well with the taste) feels a little hot on the tongue and going down the chute but that's to be expected. The perfect amount of thickness, not watery but not oily either.  Drinkability- It's scary how drinkable this beer is.

Pours an extremely dark brown, almost black, color with a 1 finger creamy light brown head. Minimal lacing.  Smell: Dark fruit, chocolate, wood, alcohol and a light hint of something I can only explain as the smell of grocery store produce department.  Taste: Toasted malt up front followed by a complex mix of chocolate, dried fruit, spices, pepper, smoky oak and burnt toast in the middle and ending with caramel malt and alcohol. The alcohol is kind of similar to cheap vodka. The aftertaste is mostly dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Good drinkability. The alcohol isn't overwhelming, though you wouldn't want to drink too many considering the ABV.  Overall: This is a very good beer.

Tons of aromas coming outta this beer. Taste is quite delightful. Initially I get strong vanilla and cherry flavors followed by some great wooden flavors. Then it end with a bit of molasses, espresso, and chocolate. The booziness is pretty noticeable in this beer though, which isn't necessarily always a bad thing to me...but I would like this one a bit more well-balance with the rest of the tasty flavors.

Couldn't see the carbonation in the glass.  Nose was woody, vanilla and biscuit malts. Wood did dominate the aroma. Since I knew this is palo santo wood, I can't say it's oaky, but the vanilla notes makes it very close to oak, those not as strong.  Tasting, the beer is very well balanced. Some pine hops and wood dominated initially, it quickly transitions sweet malts and vanilla. Only a light sweetness left on the tongue after the swallow. Surprisingly well hidden 12.00% ABV on this on. It enhances the flavor profile nicely, without the alcohol burn, so the time aging really balances out this beer.

I guess at 12% my expectations should be different than an 8%. I gave it a little higher grades just for the fact that they fit 12% alcohol in there. Otherwise, it would have been much worse.  The beer was really strong. Lots of alcohol taste until I was about 3/4 through the bottle. I enjoy 8%, but this may have just been too much. Not much wood aging taste either. Maybe the plum and raisin, I really don't know.  I had it ice cold, as cold as they come. Although I'm not a huge fan of this brewery, I did enjoy thier pumpkin.

Appearance 4.5/5 Pitch black with a dark brown, big, and dense head. Great head retention and lacing. The looks of this beer will give any imperial stout a run for its money!  Aroma 4.5/5 Refreshingly different: a very unique smell that is obviously from Palo Santo wood. Indeed boner inducing, as DFH says on the bottle. Wood, spice, and vanilla, with perhaps some spicy hop character. No booze!  Taste 4.5/5 Caramel, roast, and the wood like quality of the aroma. Sweet from the malts and the alcohol but not solventy. This beer is a good example of an high ABV beer that's not ""hot"". At some point close to the finish the hop bitterness kicks in, and leads to a medium finish in conjunction with the roast: had it not been for these, the finish would've been too sweet.

While I've never smelled Palo Santo wood, one can clearly pick out the spicy aromatic woodiness from the mix of rich maltiness.  Taste -- Chocolate, brown sugar, dab of light molasses, coffee and cream, vanilla, and an intense flavor of sandalwood. Spice in the finish, black pepper, along with some medicinal hops. Alcohol is quite stealth.  Mouthfeel -- Thick and velvety with moderate carbonation. A mild warming of the throat is the only trace of alcohol in this behemoth. Really quite satisfying.  Drinkability -- A quality beer that's more akin to an RIS than a brown ale. Very unique, lots of good stuff happening and it's especially drinkable for 12% abv, but the wood is quite overwhelming, as if someone dropped a cone of sandalwood incense into my glass.

Smell- very woody in the smell, not to sure what palo santo wood smells like, but it is reminiscent of cedar. That is the dominant aroma, not to much is coming through.  Taste- Some caramel malts, roasted malts, slighly bitter chocolate and earthyness from the giant wood barrels. Some vanilla and nuttyness in there as well. A bit of alcohol poking through too.

Caramel, molasses, brown sugar....just thick. As it goes toward the finish, the alcohol becomes very apparent. At 12 percent, I suppose that's no surprise. But it's quite obvious. There's a roasted malt/chocolate character that kicks in, as well as an oak taste that mixes in with the alcohol and molasses. After the swallow, a good amount of sticky sweetness remains on the palate. It's really like a bourbon in a way, as it warms up it becomes REALLY boozy. Of all beers I've had thus far, this one seems closest to a hard liquor.  I really can appreciate this beer. It's big...very big.

The pour is really impressive, compelling and pretty. Deep, dark body with a gorgeous, foamy chocolate milkshake colored head. The scent doesn't give away a whole hell of a lot. There's oak and there's booze and it makes me want to know more. Upon warming it gives hints as to what's to come. Flavorwise, this might be the closest experience to drinking a red wine I've had with beer, other than Le Coq Imperial Extra Double Stout, which outright tasted like a Cabernet Sauvignon to me, and not like beer at all... The scents do give away a WINE! alarm Besides the wine comparison which comes out of the wood aging, the flavor profile is quite like that of Dogfish Head's Indian Brown ale and Raison D'etre- deep dark sugar sweetness in a raisin kind of way. Some smokey edges. Mix those two beers, bump up the alcohol content and age that brew in oak... yeah. That's what this beer is. Pricey as I've seen this, as far as beer goes ('round $4 for twelve ounces), I will easily think about this as an alternative to a big red wine, secure in the knowledge that I know I'll definitely enjoy this.

The mouthfeel is thick and has average carbonation. This finishes dry, and has a good aftertaste. The beer is very drinkable for a high ABV brew. It goes down smoothly, and doesn't overwhelm you. The only thing that turns me off slightly is the alcohol taste that shows up in the middle of each sip. Overall, a high quality brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,mmva321,4.2,"Poured into a pint glass.  Thanks Dogfish Head, now I have wood too.  So these were aged in 10,000 gallon Paraguayan Palo Santo wood brewing vessels. Terrific. I hope it was worth it, because so often the playfulness of the brewery hasn't been matched by quality results. But this is a different story. DGF may be moving out of my home state of Illinois, I was sad at first, but I'm going to be devestated because every now and then they come out with a beer like this that is insane to execute and very playful, but doesn't forget that it needs to be a solid well-rounded beer.  Don't know where that came from. Anyway...  A: Pours almost black, but just slightly dark brown around the edges. About 2.5 fingers of dark caramel head dissipate quickly, leaving some lacing around the glass as you drink. It's all nice.  S: Dark fruit isn't always my favorite, but this may be my favorite beer to feature dark fruit, in this case it almost smells like licorice since that fruitiness mixes with the high alcohol presence in the beer. But there is also a caramel maltiness and woody tones that add substance.  T: Once again, I've tried dark fruit and strong alcohol featured beers, and I've always had mixed feelings, but this beer does it right by my taste. It is complimented and well offset by vanilla or caramel malts and also what's really special: a deep, smokey, earthy and devine wood taste that comes through as you let the taste linger. The beer lives up to its name, because it's that ""brewing vessel"" that really makes the beer work.  M: It's good. Maybe a little too thick as it's already somewhat of a chore to drink a 12% ABV beer with this strong of alcohol involved, but I really can't complain.  D: Of course it can be hard to drink because the alcohol is so present, but the taste really makes this beer a pleasure to drink and after that alcohol diminishes you want more simply because of how good it is.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,dogger6253,4.94,"Dark, completely opaque. Sort of a coffee brown color with a little ring of mocha head on top.  The nose is strong with dark fruit and a molasses-y malt. A tinge of alcohol in the background alongside a lingering smokiness.  Flavor is a real winner. There is a lot of complexity, several pleasant flavors all dancing together. Very earthy, sweetened by tastes of cherries, plums, vanilla and brown sugar. Each flavor holds a bit of smokiness over the top of it. A little bit of tobacco and bourbon in the backdrop ties everything back together in the finish.  A very rich, creamy feel in this beer. The lack of carbonation lets the heavier flavors shine a little more to me. There is a nice warmth in each sip without the usual booziness that comes with that which is surprising considering the alcohol content. This feels like a real home run to me, strongly recommend.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Very deep brown, with a brown sugar, or perhaps pecan colored head that, though being slightly thin, lasts absolutely forever. S- Very malty, a bit alcoholy, hops (as would be expected from DHF), and just the slightest bit of woodyness. I'm a bit disappointed considering how much of this new smell I'm supposed to be getting. T- Here is where the wood plays a role. It's got a certain smokyness to it. Not like Rauchbier, but... more like an earthyness with some smoke attatched. This flavor connects itself to a slight fruityness and an intense maltyness for a massive level of complexity. A bit of vanilla, and almost a bit of whiskey flavor in there as well. Somewhat hot in the finish. M- Absolutely spot on mouthfeel. Couldn't imagine better for style. Slightly chewy, pretty full bodied, certainly so for style. Finishes creamy. Exactly what I'm looking for in this style. D- A top notch beer. As per DFH tradition they take a style and make it something new and insane. I really enjoyed this beer. Very little to critique it on. With that in mind, it was a bit hot for me. This is a beer that needs to be aged. As fresh as it was, it was too hot for me to give it high drinkability marks. Did I enjoy it? Absoltely. If you want the pinnacle of browns, buy this, age it for a year or so, and then drink it.

T: A lot of dark fruit, some cherries, as well as some brown sugar and chocolate. Also a hint of vanilla.  M/D: Its creamy and heavier than expected, more like a stout or porter than a brown ale.

The smell is incredibly sweet and rich; vanilla, molasses, brown sugar, and a slight amount of alcohol, along with a slight bready quality.  The taste is sweet with an underlying bitterness; dark chocolate, candied cherries, brown sugar, and honey, tempered with a bit of hops (or is that bitter baker's chocolate?). Malty, complex and tasty, this is a real sipper of a brew. Slightly boozy at first, that flavor disappears as you get into it.  Mouthfeel is thick and full at first, ending dry.  Highly drinkable, this is easily the tenth time I've had this monster brown ale. With three more waiting for me in the cellar, I look forward to enjoying this one for a while.  UPDATE  I had cellared one 12 oz bottle with a bottling date of 2/19/09. I cracked it open today, and I swear, it only go tbetter! Smoother, not as boozy, with plenty of caramel, vanilla and bready flavors. Hard to call this a brown ale, especially with as well as it has aged.

I poured a 12 oz. bottle into my Bruery tulip glass. It poured a deep black/brown color with a small thick brown head. Good lacing. One wiff of this and I knew I would love it. Smells very malty/sweet with coffee and a slight alcoholic presence. Tastes delicious - sweet, super malty, a bit of vanilla and lots of coffee and chocolate. A nice smokiness to it with a good amount of hops that balance it out a bit. Not as thick as it first seems, but still has very little carbonation for a brown ale. Alcohol is well hidden.

Nothing overly special, though I suppose it's on the prettier end of things as far as brown ales go.  Smell: Nutty scent, and malty. One can easily tell that this one's going to be a well-balance brew.  Taste: Has that woody/nutty taste and that balance between bitterness and malty character which seems to characterize many of many Dogfish Head's brews.

Aroma is well-rounded and just present enough with sweet chocolate and tame, roasted oats.  Tastes of the barrel-inspired vanilla notes are quickly kicked aside by dry, heavy, roasted malt flavors... but wait a minute! The vanilla (and a surprising licorice note) comes right back on the finish.  Despite the strength of the flavors (and alcohol), the viscosity of the body and balance of all involved make the mouth-feel suburb and the beer itself a phenomenal drink.

Dark brown foam is creamy and dense, holds well. Not a whole lot of lacing though, and the 08 fades a bit faster.  Both smell nice; heavenly wood aromas with lots of brown sugar. 08 shows a bit more dark fruit, while the 09 more black licorice and alcohol. I think I actually like the 2009 version better, has a more 'green' wood aroma.  Malts range from chocolate to dark bready grains to burnt caramel. Lingering licorice flavors and the wood is very unique and noticeable. Some raisin fruitiness comes out as it warms. I like the 08 better in the taste...it has a mellower wood influence and the alcohol is very smooth. Incredible drinkability for a 12%'er.

The end begins to get pretty vegetative and similar to wet grass which I'm not digging too much. Intervened in what I'm perceiving as wood is a very sweet alcoholic rich beer. The sweetness is right at the border of cloying to me. Once again my mind races to make this beer similar to batch 9000 in richness and sweetness.  This beer just coats my mouth in sticky thick beer.

The taste is as bold as the aroma. The Palo Santo wood it's aged in is definitely evident, because instead of the traditional oaky flavor there is a slightly different taste, which is definitely wood related. There is certainly also a note of smokiness. It is sweet and slightly syrupy. It is labeled a brown ale, and as such, it reminds me of a more complex, more alcoholic version of the DFH Indian Brown.  It's too strong to be very drinkable, but it's a very intense, complex, and eminently enjoyable drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,generallee,4.79,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance: It has an almost opaque dark brown body with lighter chestnut highlights near the edges of the glass. The pour is deep, dark and thick, making a small light brown head to sit on top. This head fades out quickly however and leaves a thin ring of tan foam lace. A quick swirl gives it a wispy thin film covering and slick lace.  Smell: The aroma has toasted bready malt, roasted grain, sweet brown sugar and molasses. This gives it a sweet overall character but there is also some fresh cut pine, resin, hops, dark wood and leathery notes. Its alcohol is noticeable as well.  Taste/Palate: There is a lot of complexity here in this big full bodied beer. There are sweet notes of brown sugar, vanilla, molasses, raisons, and prunes. This is balanced with some floral/woody notes, pine resin, leafy hops and dark hard wood. It also has notes of toasted bread, roasted grain and warm alcohol that give it a bit of bite. This all comes on a heavy, slightly viscous texture with smooth carbonation.  Notes: It's big and complex with a bit of bite, which should mellow nicely with age. This is a big winner in my book.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Dark cherry, vanilla, woody, caramel, nutty, plum, and fig. Also noted a chocolate taste.  M A little oily and buttery. This beer has a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue. A full bodied beer with a very long finish.  D Very drinkable if sitting with it for about a half hour. This is not a pounding beer.  Overall this is a great beer.

10099,33832,Manoftyr,4.75,"Appearance-Pours a slick, very, very, very dark almost black brown into the glass, about of finger of mocha colored head rises and lingers longer than I would expect for the ABV and leaves a sizable ring of lacing along the edges as it recedes. The consistency of the pour has that sick motor-oil consistency one typically associates with Imperial Stouts, though this is billed as a brown ale by DFH.  Aroma-Darkly roasted malts reminiscent of a brown ale only much, much more intense. A caramely-woodsy aroma, which I assume comes from the Palo Santo wood, mingles with milk chocolate and dark fruits to concoct one of the most intriguing and intoxicating aromas I've yet to come across. No alcohol detected on the nose.  Taste-Robustly bittersweet flavors of oaken caramel, vanilla, plums, raisins, dark chocolate and just the slightest tinge of a burn of alcoholic heat to remind you of the ABV of this bad boy. The woodiness *really* comes through on the finish and smooths everything out nicely, it's a very unique kind of woodiness too, definitely not piny but not exactly oaken either, which I imagine is the result of the unique wood they used for this brew.  Mouthfeel-Thick, but not quite as viscous and chewy as an RIS; I can see why they billed this as a Brown ale, maybe a new style category is in order for this brew; Imperial Brown ale perhaps?  Drinkability-Not sure how to rate it on this scale, it's not really a beer to knock back and pound, it's intended to be savored and drank slowly. For what they were going for, I think the drinkability is pretty solid.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

A - Pours a very dark brown nearly black. Some reddish highlights. Syrupy. Slight tan head that dissipated quickly except around the edges.  S - Alcohol, followed by vanilla and caramel.  T - Lots going on thanks to the wood. The vanilla is there as well as raisin. Light smoke and toasted malt.  M - Creamy, syrupy low carbonation. Similar to a stout. Smooth. Almost chewy.

I am more of an IPA fan, but this beer is a must have.  A: very dark, unexpected, yet clear and very smoothe looking. Pours heavy, almost syrupy.  S: First impression is a smoky and carmelly, but you can smell the booziness in this one (12%). Has subltle chocolate and coffee hints as well.  T: Exceptional for a brown ale. Very strong and very boozy on the tongue. But is perfectly balanced with carmel flavor. Leaves and incredible smoky, boozy, yet sweet taste the tongue that translates into a very sweet caramel aftertaste.  M: very thick and rich. I described it to my wife as almost desert in a cup! Not a ton of carbonation, but is not necessary due to the bitter/boozy/smoky flavors.  D: Surprisingly drinkable for a syrupy brown ale with a thick, rich flavor.

Bourbon and dark malts add almost a wine like character. The smell is very complex.  The taste is very smoky and roasty. Raisins and plums dance alongside an oaky wood aftertaste evidence of barrel aging. There is no shortage of brown sugary molasses.  Definitely heavy in the mouth and I was not ready for this rich of a beer. There is a somewhat sour aftertaste which mixes with a lot of sugar giving me sticky saliva.

T - Rich, roasted malts, brown sugar, some molasses. And also vanilla notes brought out by the palo santo wood. Also some spice that I cant make out. Slightly astringent.  M - Fairly robust IMO for the style. Almost like a porter/stout. Creamy, syrupy and my bottle had little carbonation.  D - I could only handle one of these per sitting. High abv.

The deeply tanned, light brown head is two fingers thick and creamy.  This brew smells of deep roasted, sweet caramel and vanilla. There is also a definte woodiness in the nose, and a descent whiff of alcohol presence at the finish.  Big, complex flavors in this one. Roasted caramel, vanilla, dark earthy fruit, some espresso notes, hints of chocolate and a very unique finish that is dry, but also has what I would guess is the Palo Santo wood aging, which lingers long. Meal in a glass. Awesome stuff. Excellent balance of bitters and sweetness.  Heavy, chewey brew in the mouth that is incredibly smooth and creamy.  I recently had this at DFH Restaurant in Rehoboth Beach, DE and I believe it is a bit better on tap, but to be honest - this is one heck of a brown ale. You can definitely feel the abv here, but there is just so much going on in terms of flavor that if you have not tried this, it is well worth a try.

The smell imparts very strong ""in your face"" estery alcohol with a backgrounded malty sweet nutty brown ale feel. I get some dark maple and molasses in there.  The flavors are great in this brew, up front strong alcohol flavor, gives a wood aged bourbon feel in the taste while keeping a brown malt sweet flavor to back it. I actually get a bit of cherry flavor milling about in there and a roasted sugared chesnut type flavor. There is a very distinct finishing aftertaste to this brew that I cannot account for with anything except the wood fermenters they make it in.  I love the mouthfeel on this brew, it's thickness and darkness with minimal carbonation combines with a hot alcohol barrel aged type feeling.

It sports a dark brown collar that recedes most of the way after a couple minutes.  S - Dark chocolate jumps out immediately along with strong wood notes from the Palo Santo. If I didn't know better I would have pegged it to be aged in whiskey barrels. There's a really nice vanilla note as well, along with a mild earthiness that's probably coming from the barrel instead of hops at this point.  T - The wood packs a big punch. I know I've read that people prefer the beer fresh because the wood is more prominent, and while I haven't had it fresh I would imagine I'd prefer at this stage. It seems as though there would be a lot of rough edges when it's fresh. The wood flavor is almost biting, if that makes sense, in how flavorful it is. Dark chocolate is prominent upfront, followed by some fruitiness the earthiness I mentioned. At this point the sharpness of the alcohol steps in before fading into vanilla. There's also some slight roastiness in the finish, which makes me think this beer isn't properly labeled as a brown ale. Then again, I don't know what to call it.  MF - It hits mark pretty well. Silky smooth, but with enough carbonation to keep it from feeling too big. Leaves the mouth coated and sticky, but on a level that feels appropriate.  D - I would imagine it's better than this would be fresh, but I think it could still go quite a ways with a bit more time.

The aroma is roasted malts, coffee, a bit of sweetness, alcohol, and something I can't identify. Which i assume is the wood showing through. Pretty interesting. The flavor extends from the nose nicely, it rounded and well balanced bitter and sweet. Alcohol presence is strong, and with 12% ABV that makes sense.

A= dark dark thick rich black-brown, modest head when served to me in a brandy snifter at Dogfish Head, Gaithersburg MD.  S= I could spend hours just sniffing this. HUGE smoky bold nose bringing reminiscences of an old country inn burning rare hardwood in a fireplace. The Palo Santo wood from Peru really does fulfil its fame! All sorts of other notes going on here, plentiful hops florals, some dark fruits, but smoke and more gorgeous smoke.!  T= the Scent was shades of things to come. More smoke, as promised. Bold, rich, dry, over the top strong flavors, wood, I was overwhelmed and will need to hopefully return for another snifter and pay more careful attention to details. Suffice it to say that I wish I lived next-door.  M= rich, smoky, strong and bold, very fulfilling.  D= amazingly this went with everything that I was eating, mostly a mixed seafood plate with homemade potato chips.

10099,33832,BatDaddy,4.33,"This one was bottled in July of 2008. Poured into a pint glass.  A - Pours a dark, dark brown that pretty much goes opaque black once it collects in the glass. A slightly aggressive pour yields a good finger of dark brown head that settles down to a nice retentive ring around the glass. This baby looks like a stout. A light wisp of bubbles continues to hang around on top.  S - Sweet cocoa and dark ripe fruit. Raisins. The wood aging appears as well. Hint of alcohol.  T - Sweet malty goodness. Dark sweet chocolate and strong notes of roasted espresso. Hints of the raisins and dark fruits. Smooth vanilla. Hint of smokiness. The mellow wood flavors really shine through on the finish and aftertaste. Hint of alcohol in there, but it's well hidden. Very complex, and very good.  M - Excellent. Smooth, chewy, and creamy.  D - Very good for a 12% brew. You have to fight the urge not to sip this one as you should.  Notes: Not sure I'd classify this one as a brown ale, as it really seems to head more into the stout territory for me, but this is one tasty beer and I don't really care what category it's in.

High abv can be detected minimally, nothing detrimental.

Palo Santo Maroon appears a very dark brown color with some redness around the edges when held up to the light. The head appears less than a finger strong with a creamy dark brown color that retains quite well for such a high abv. Lacing appears and sticks in spots about the glass. Nose has a strong dark sugary aroma much like a mix of molasses and brown sugar. Some nutty date-like scents come into play as well along with some noticeable alcohol. As the beer warms, the nose indicates some previously hidden scents of caramel and vanilla. The taste of this brew has some bold malt character coming across much like the aroma indicated but not as sweet as the nose suggested. Flavors full of dark sugary notes riddled with alcohol and a contrasting bitterness of dark grain slightly chocolatey. The finish of this brew leaves a lingering taste of woodsy flavors much unlike the usual contribution of oak. It is peculiar with a flavor I never experienced before but very much enjoyable. For such as high abv brew this is a chewy full bodied brew but very smooth in the feel and quite drinkable considering. At times the alcohol comes across a bit astringent but understandable so.

Low carbonation which is often associated with the high alcohol beers. That might improve over time as the yeast ferment the few left over fermentable sugars.  Really nice dark roasty flavors. The taste of this beer is really unique and delicious. And I will say this; the alcohol content of this beer is very well hidden. (@ 12% A.B.V.)

""American Brown Ale"" may be the official BA style designation here, but it's much closer to a Barleywine or Old Ale in many respects.  Its greatest quality is the temperament left from the barrel-aging in the Palo Santo wood, which imparts a depth of flavor unrivaled in the DFH oeuvre. (Is that vanilla I discern?)  The overall effect is something very much akin to a fine sherry, and it should be consumed in a similar fashion -- slowly, deliberately, and luxuriously.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

There is a slightly fuzzy mouthfeel but there is no mouth coating like I expected. A syrupy stickiness is present at the lips but not much anywhere else. A slightly drying wood feel moments after swallowing is also present and there is no alcohol burn.  This is a very fun beer to drink.

ALso present are whiffs of sweet bread, coffee liquer and maple syrup.  A symphonic array of flavors are present in this 'holy shit' taste dept. THe flavor morphs in your mouth.

The close is long and dry with a lingering coffee flavor.  Full bodied sipper with an ultra smooth velvety texture. this is borderline perfection.  This is truly a fine crafted brew.

A - Pours thick and near-black, with a one-finger khaki head that quickly recedes into a smoky ring that stays for most of the duration. Wait, this isn't an impy stout? It looks like a fantastic stout, but I'll have to mark it down slightly for being a brown ale that isn't, well, brown.  S - Rich aromas of wood (mahogany and oak), cocoa beans, and bitter coffee. Some figs and prunes as well. Again, a brown ale? But wait, I'm definitely catching tree nuts and conifer aromas as well, and some caramelized brown sugar. Okay, a brown ale then, and it smells wonderful.  T - Wood and dark chocolate right up front, the coffee is there also. Nutty, roasted malts arrive quickly, and warm the palate. Discernable hop bitterness balances nicely. Outstanding.  M - Unreal smoothness and a thick, syrupy body. Yet again, much more reminiscent of an imperial stout, but I can't mark it down for not following style this time. This smoky, creamy textured charmer is one of the best feeling beers I've sampled.  D - This is a big beer at 12%, but it hides its alcohol heat better than anything this side of Dark Lord. A compulsive gulper, and I enjoyed each drop.  This could very easily be called a stout, or at least a porter, and no one would blink.

10099,33832,gregmoscetti,4.55,"brewed feb 2008. Consumed may 2010.  A buddy of mine and I have been socking away palo santo's here and their since they became available in California (about feb. 2008). Since the acquisition of this beer, my palate has matured and refined itself to not only really appreciate its flavor, body and nuances, but to also appreciate this beer in all stages of its development. This last bottle was exceptional. It was chocolaty and creamy and spot on par with the hair of the dog Adam that we drank afterward.  Hell of a beer. Four Stars.

10099,33832,jt31914,3.15,"12 oz. Bottle.... and I thought I was drinking a typical brown ale...  A: Dark brown, maybe even black, no head and no lacing (sound familiar, it's called an imperial stout).  S:Smells like World Wide Stout almost, tons of licorice and alcohol. I like it, but this really isn't anything like a brown ale to me. Also some smoky dark malt flavor hidden in there.  D/M: A little bit harsh but also creamy.  This is to brown ales as Lou Ferigno is to actors; you kind of like him but don't actually think of him as a real actor, more of a bodybuilder.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,FreshHawk,3.93,"A - Very dark brown, almost black, with ruby brown hues on the edges. Large, thick, frothy, and creamy light sandy beige head with very good retention and a good sized layer of creamy sticky lacing left.  S - This is definitely interesting to smell as it as a number of aromas, some I don't know really what they are. There is a good amount of dark malt smell with caramel and molasses in there and hints of smokiness. There is also some overriding tart/acidic aroma that I don't know what it is or how to significantly explain it.  T - Starts with a bit of dark malt with just hints of dark bread and even fainter hint of chocolate. That quickly gives way to a subtle dark fruit tartness. This then quickly opens up into a smokey, charred wood flavor. Underlying this is some burnt brown sugar and molasses. The finish has a strong peaty/charred wood tasting bitterness along with a fair amount of alcohol, and just the faintest underlying of dark fruit. The peat/charred wood really lingers on the tongue for quite some time. Reminds me a bit of a whisky really.  M - A touch more than medium body with slightly under moderate carbonation. Pretty smooth.  D - The alcohol and wood/peat can get to be a bit heavy after awhile. Definitely a sipper. Probably a good beer to have on occasion, but I don't think I'd make a habit of drinking it regularly.  Notes: Bottled on 05/27/09. Definitely an interesting beer that has a strong wood presence. Really this beer was a bit of an enigma for me whether it was trying to determine the aroma or trying to determine if I like it or not. At times I was really enjoying it, and at times I wasn't so sure. It's a beer that I'd really have to be in the mood for to have again. The wood/peat and alcohol were a little strong for me, but at times they worked. Those being so prominent reminded me of a whisky at times. Definitely worth a try to see how you feel about it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

A: Appears to have the viscosity of milk as poured. One finger head, deliciously dark caramel color. Beer looks like a stout in the glass. Very dark brown, almost black.  S: Wow. Blown away. So complex. Has a very intense caramel, woody, roasted malt smell. Intense smell lasts throughout the whole glass, but changes. Licorice sweetness becomes noticeable.  T: Perfect example of a beer that has a taste that almost exactly matches the aroma. Malty, roasted, sweet, woody. AMAZING! Truly phenomenal beer.  M: Very thick, feels smooth and minimally carbonated.  D: One 12oz bottle is perfect to be split between two people unless you don't mind sipping on this for a very long time.

No hops in sight. It finishes dry with overtones of burnt wood and warming alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Very thick and silky. It's full-bodied with very little carbonation.  Harmony: Drink with food.

Red tinged around the edges, though it is a struggle to see any hues other than pitch blackness. Virtually no head to speak of, though there are a bit of tiny brown bubbles that cling to the edges of the glass. Minute lacing present also. Smell is big wood and the major alcohol punches you in the nose. Surely smells like a big ass beer. Also tastes heavily of the wood. The alcohol warmth of this is crazy. Almost has a bourbon characteristic to it. A very unique tasting brew, unlike anything I've ever encountered. Feel is light and smooth for such a monster beverage, burning sensation on the way down, though it is a good burn. I have to rate the drinkability of this a bit low, due to the heavy booze content.

This basically looks like a Russian imperial stout. Good, though.  Smell: very woody and a little fruity. The fruit is almost like a hint of apples; like someone just chopped apples on a wood cutting board. Interesting, to say the least.  Taste: biting, peppery woodiness followed by a sweet alcoholic fruitiness. It then dries out and the wood comes back at a little less strong a flavor. An interesting and dynamic flavor profile; it is definitely complex. I will say though that I don't find the woodiness of the Palo Santo as tasty as, say, oak.  Mouthfeel: medium-thick body and plenty of well-integrated carbonation. Delicious creaminess abounds here.  Drinkability: this is rather tasty, but due to strength in both flavor and alcohol I don't think I'd want to session this.

Has a bready smell like dark rye.  T - Coffee and smoke. It has a slightly delayed attack, starting sweet across the tongue and fading to an acrid follow.  M - Not carbonated. You can feel (but not so much taste) the alcohol. For such a heavy taste it's a bit dry.  D - With the 12% ABV and the very complex flavor it's not the kind you'd throw back socially.

The heat really kills everything else going on here, although there is a ton of wood flavors that come through in the finish. Malts are slightly detectable, maybe some spice too, but this beer is all booze.  Mouthfeel is rich and carbonated. I am kind of surprised at the high carbonation seeing as it was aged wooden vessels. Very strange and not very pleasant.

Smell: Smells like I went to a lumberyard, took some wood, made a bonfire, and toasted some marshmallows. Very intriguing. Molasses, brown sugar, plumb, and toasted malts abound.  Taste: Molasses, toffee, brown sugar, and dark fruits are present in the flavor as well as the aroma.

The malt gives off a sugary taste, with a caramel sweetness; a touch of brown sugar is in there as well. A woodsy and earth flavor takes over halfway and finishing with a mild citric and earthy bitterness. A thin syrup feel is at the start then it thickens up and finishing an oily slickness towards the back.

There is a nice sweetness that is underlying a malty bitter back. The palo santo aging is coming out in spades.

Poured black with a shade of brown and a dark khaki head that disappeared immediately. What stayed on top of my beer left an owl head in my glass. The owls are not what they seem. Lacing was almost negligible.  S: Lumberyard, molasses, and chewy toffee. There is a bit of spice, with some cinnamon and brown sugar notes, as well. Also, some cherry and plum notes are hiding in there. Sawdust.  T: There is a spicy cinnamon hint that supports a deep molasses and brown sugar flavor. The Palo Santo wood really gives a nice depth to the overall flavor. It balances the sweetness with a tannin taste the hits the back and sides of my palate. The dark fruit flavors are present, but not dominant. The alcohol is more detectable as the beer warms.  M: A good full body, but it could be a bit creamier, for my mouth. It is kind of upfront on the palate, instead of washing over the whole structure of my mouth. The alcohol does add a nice, full finish to the swallow.  D: With the high a.b.v. and tannin feel on the palate, this one is just a bit of a challenge to drink.

Smell: Smells of sweet malty wood. There is a bit of alcohol on the nose but I mainly pick up on the malt, caramel, and wood.  Taste: Reminiscent of the smell but with several more layers of complexity. Malt, caramel, wood, raisins, molasses, brandy, and a slight bitter chocolate bitterness. The wood was a great extra bit of flavor.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Thick, slight carbonation, and scarily smooth. Quite unlike any brown ale I've tried thus far.

10099,33832,PBoegel,4.32,"Bottle date February 17, 2009, poured into a wide body Dogfish Head snifter, 13 months in the bottle.  Appearance is near black, extremely dark, would need to be in a shot glass to see any real color density and clarity, with a vigorous pour the head is an inch and a half light brown.  The aroma is very malt forward with a cocoa character, some dried fruit, touch of currants and raisins. Vanilla bean, dark rum and touches of maple sap and raw honey. A wave of alcohol and then earthy wood tones. No hop aroma really to speak of. There is a resinous character that I can't quite put my finger on that can only be realistically attributed to the Palo Santo Wood and it mingles with the alcohol as almost raw tobacco leaf.  The flavor on this beer is just incredible and difficult to wrap your head around, there is a huge warming alcohol that washes the tongue and hits the back of the throat, unlike any other beer I have ever had. The alcohol sensation is akin to chiplote peppers. Usually a heat like this is abrasive or offensive in a beer, but is extremely well received. I pick up some chocolate character, big notes of dark rum, bourbon, raw earthy wood tones, pine sap, maple sap and espresso. Tobacco and slight smokiness. Hop flavor is not something found in this rich complex brew. Bitterness is apparent upfront but washed out by the residual sweetness and the alcohol, leaving a touch in the finish. Touches of roastiness as it warms.  The mouthfeel is full bodied with a very creamy silk smooth texture, semi-sweet finish, but the alcohol warmth provides a counter balance.  This is without a doubt one of the most unique beers you can experience. At this point, a year into the bottle the flavor has so much depth, it will be a fight to keep these aging.

Says 12%, this could be harsh & tough on the tongue.  Top examples include some big favorites of mine;Surley Bender & coffee Bender. So I expect to like this style. Poured into a tulip glass, seemed like a good idea since the bottle smell is pretty appealing. Raisin? Light mist of lace.  Smells like sweet, well dried prunes & funk.  Dense warming vanilla syrup. Burnt sugar. Dark & Bitter.  Heavy mouth feeling is giving me a sense of overkill when I think about drinking more.  Not as drinkable as I'd thought given the smell, taste.  Looking forward to the other bottle once is gets dusty.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Pour was deep brown bordering on black. Mouthfeel was creamy and stout-like. Huge sweet malt with brown sugar, caramel and vanilla. Prominent alcohol flavor, but not nearly so hot as one might expect. Finish was bittersweet. A style-bender for sure.

10099,33832,OttoBomb,4.2,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass (March 9, 2010). ""BOTTLED ON: 07/30/09"" is stamped onto the neck of the bottle.  Eyes: An almost opaque jet-black color, with reddish on the very edges. The one finger head is a dirty brown and dissipaes in a couple minutes. If you were to just look at this in the glass without any prior knowledge, you'd think it were a stout, though I'm a little disappointed with the head.  Nose: Strong dark malts with some nutty notes. Smoky molasses, faint dry fruit and even a hint of vanilla. Unfortunately, the overall aroma is saturated by a bit of the boozey smell, which is a bit difficult to escape with a 12% ABV. The good thing is it doesn't crush all other aspects.  Tongue: Rich, smokey, baked bread, and has a soft brandy/rum boozeyness. I get notes of the wood, with burnt caramel, molasses and a long, bitter finish.  Mouth: Thick, a bit chewy, with sufficient carbonation despite the apparent lack of head.  Libation: Like many Dogfish brews, this is an extreme beer that could be considered an experiment. I can't actually say what exactly Paraguayan wood does for this ""stoutish"" brown ale, but it works. For such a heavy beer with such a high ABV, I'm impressed at how smooth and subtle the flavors are. Palo Santo Marron is incredibly complex, but enjoy these slowly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,mjaseattle,3.87,"A: I chilled mine a little too long, poured it extra cold. This I blame for the lack of any head, something with which I'm positive it was well endowed the last time I tried it. Otherwise, it's a dark, dark, dark brown, completely impermeable to any wavelength of light greater than 200 nanometers (rough estimate).  S: Sweet, malty, earthy, licorice and figs.  T/M: There's definitely something special going on in those Palo Santo barrels. The sweetness of caramel and chocolate is most apparent, and, if you look for it, lots of vanilla. It packs a lot of surprises as well. It's the kind of beer I like to swish around in my mouth, puff that body up a little. This beer seems to enjoy being treated that way too, responding playfully, revealing something new with each sip. A little espresso here, some chocolate covered raisins there, and every now and then the distinct aftertaste of cherries. I do worry that all this sweetness and shyness is hiding something though. Its... beerness, if I may, feels inhibited.  D: One is probably enough. If not for the alcohol content (a surprising 12% -- it is clearly made of ninjas because I couldn't taste it), then for the syrupy smack of flavors clinging to your tongue long after the final sip. If you're still thirsty and liver-willing, I suspect it would follow nicely with a good Belgian golden ale, or even a crisp Irish red.  Overall: The Palo Santo Marron is absolutely unique. It probably won't change your life, but if you like dark ales I think you should try it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

It was dark and thick, looked like a nice porter with a half-inch, dark brown foam head. The smell is of sandalwood, very nice and relaxing. The taste was not the best, again like sandalwood, which I prefer in a candle as opposed to a beer. It was also very syrupy too.

10099,33832,nickspagnolo,2.25,"This is not a beer; it is a beer flavored liquor. The alcohol content is too high for this beer to be enjoyable to drink. Other flavors associated with this beer are syrup.  I was expecting something better from Dogfish Head since I have enjoyed their Indian Brown Ale and Punkin Ale. I was expecting to get punched in the face with flavor - like I was with DFH's IBA and Punkin Ale (both of which have relatively higher alcohol contents than traditional beer) - and instead I got a mild flavored beer that is overpowered by alcohol.  The only saving graces of this beer are its smell and appearance. The beer smelled woody and sweet and it intrigued my nostrils. As for appearance, it is extremely dark in color with a thin foam.  I will not be purchasing this again unless I have had a terrible day and need to get wasted.

Very weird.  First sip is very caramel-like in texture and feel. The raised alcohol content is very upfront as well, making this brown ale seem much more like a stout. Overall, much more bitter and dark that what I'd expect out of a brown ale. Still, it all seems to mellow out over the long run.  A surprisingly strong, surprisingly drinkable brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Phelps,4.07,"I've got wood! Palo Santo wood, that is.  I saw a documentary long ago relating the story of Dogfish Head and their quest to build massive tanks from this special, super-dense wood from Paraguay. I remember being super-excited to try it. So when I saw a pack for sale at Whole Foods recently, I snatched it up right quick.  The liquid from this bottle is a deep, intensely dark brown. Nearly no light penetrates, though the faintest cranberry red highlights are visible at the bottom of the glass. A half-inch head the color of brown sugar tops this guy off. The head recedes to a heavy sheen of suds that would probably stick around forever if I wasn't so damn thirsty. Glorious webs of lacing paint the glass as I drink.  After taking a whiff, my first thought was: bourbon. If I didn't know better, I'd say this thing was aged in bourbon barrels. There are tons of sweet flavors here: brown sugar, caramel, and alcohol-hot vanilla extract. Pretty glorious.  The vanilla extract character definitely carries over into the taste, though the alcohol heat is very well-hidden--noticeable, but not overpowering. Roasted malts are only hinted at a little after the swallow. Some woodsy pine characters emerge as the beer warms. Frankly, I was expecting more.  The mouthfeel is much the same. Light carbonation, a palpable creaminess and a full body fill the mouth with delight. But then, some unpleasant chalkiness gets the back sides of my tongue.  For such a bruiser of a beer, this one went down surprisingly quickly. This isn't the first time I've bought a four-pack of Palo Santo, and it won't be the last. My go-to from DFH.  ---  Cellar Notes  Bottled May 27, 2009 and enjoyed Feb. 16, 2011.  Has developed a rather cigarette-like, ashy quality in the nose. It's in the background behind the other flavors, but still there.  This ash carries over to the taste as well, though in a slightly subdued form. The way the flavors have melded is actually incredible -- it's hard to discern one flavor from another. The roastiness seems to have increased slightly, lingering on the tongue between sips. The body's also developed a nice creaminess I don't think was there before.  While super-smooth and flavorful, it also seems to have been tamed a bit too much. I think I prefer this beer fresh, when it's vinous, un-cigarette-like, and has more teeth.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,CaptinRedBeard,3.83,"A: Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip. Pours a beautiful dark brown color with burgundy highlights. Almost no head here at all, about an eighth of an inch that dissapears instantly. More legs here than lacing.  S: A very vinous quality, that i can only assume is being imparted by the palo santo wood. I mean The aroma here is like a strong red wine with hints of malt and coffee in the background.  T: Red wine, roasted malt and dark fruits, mostly raisin with a faint hint of espresso flavor in the background.  M: Like silk going down. Medium to heavy bodied but oh so smooth on the pallet. Perfect amount of carbonation.  D: 12% is not noticeable in the least. With no alchol heat at all I could probably drink this all night but I'm pretty sure after about two or three I'd be done for.

I think the cherry aftertaste is my favorite part.  M: Not thick, but leaves a cherry coating behind that's very enjoyable. Syrupy would be a good adjective for this beer.  D: For a beer with 12% alc., it's incredibly smooth.  Overall, this is a really nice and unique beer.

10099,33832,sudsellier,4.26,"poured into a belgian Duvel glass.  A: Ultra-dark... not what I expected. Looks like coffee poured into my glass. Rather disappointing head (poured out of bottle) evaporated into a thin ring of foam less than 5 minutes after pour. Nice color, though.  S: Super-woodsy. Giant malt content. Because of the rather high alcohol content, I get lots of the South American wood for the barrel aging followed by dark candy sugars and alcohol heat. Probably too woozy to successfully represent any smells at this time... damn deep-poured coctails @ the Azalea Coctail Lounge! Slight chocolate-milk and barrel aromas.  T: Raisiny/sugary in a port wine sensibility. Kinda pruny. Big residual sugars. There's that candy sugar note again. Tons of dried fruits like apricot and prune. Slightly smoked and heavy but also highly drinkable. Tart, candied cherry finish to this hunka-hunka burnin' like.  M: Despite lack of residual head, this has plenty of sizzle in the carbonation. Chewy, thick texture, too. Finishes ultra-clean texturally with big flavor notes left over to think about. How does my mouth feel? Just dandy after sippin' upon this brawny brew.  D: Most likely one a night. There's Shakespeare's rub about a beer like this: wonderful in so many different ways, yet something about it is holding you back. Don't get me wrong, it's a damn tasty beer. Could I plough through an entire sixer? No. But I could easily savor one to three of these given the proper situation. Deep-dark-smokish-rich-heavy... this is a beer for advocates to savor once a night over the course of an hour to really take in what makes this one crank your motor. One will be just dandy... three and you're asking for a wake-up next to someone who shaves their legs with less frequency than you do. Careful. All-in-all, the Palo Santo makes for a terrific pairing with certain courses... like the seared tarragon-basil-garlic lamb chops we just did over a fingerling potato and onion hash with a roasted veal bone/vanilla bean foyot reduction... yes... be jealous... you should.

Toasty malt and vanilla is not replaced by other flavors, but rather incorporates them into single package. Leathery oak flavor lingers for a long, extensive afteraste. These flavors work beautifully with each other.  M - Medium/light carbonation. Works well for this rich brew. Alcohol is very warming, and is a little much when the beer warms.

A bit boozy and earthy. Pretty complex, it's hard to focus on any one aroma.  T- Sweet caramels and a vicious punch of aroma. Dark fruits also come through in the taste. A bit roasted with a slightly dry finish, probably from the ABV. Very good!  M- Velvety smooth and a bit chewy. Heavy body with light carbonation. Everything I could expect from a beer like this.

I was actually a little surprised that this was a brown ale, because it really drinks more like a stout. Nice and thick, rich, great kick to it, all around one of my favorites.  Bad side ... very pricey. But then again most beers in it's category are, but I can say that I'm not disappointed. I feel, and I'm sure a lot of you do, that if you are paying around $3.50 per bottle or $7 per sifter, you really expect something great, and for me it delivered.

The Palo Santo wood tones (never smelled that kind of wood) were very nice and it seemed like a bunch of other flavors in a wooden bowl as the backbone. Flavors included: brown sugar, cocoa, ripe cherries, licorice, and cinnamon. The alcohol was masked very well.  The flavor was very warm. Roasted chocolate and some coffee bitterness, typical of brown ales, were accompanied by dark sugars, ripe fruit, vanilla, licorice, and warming alcohol. The wood tones were apparent more in the finish. Awesome complexity and harmony within the flavors.  The body was good and full. The feel was sticky and mouth-coating with a numbing chewy finish. The carbonation was very mild and added just a slight bite towards the end.  The complexity was excellent, and it was all bottled in a potent but smooth and easy to drink package.

They gave me as generous a pour as they could of this deep, dark mahogany brown ale into a 12 oz. snifter, leaving only enough room for a thin, creamy head. The aroma wasn't too pronounced (maybe because of the nearly overfilled glass), but I definitely smelled some of the sweetness and maybe a bit of nuttiness that you'd expect from a high-octane brown ale, and only a faint whiff of earthy wood.  The wonderfully unique woodsy sweetness is much more dominant in the flavor, though, but it isn't so potent as to overpower the other flavors. An underlying nuttiness comes through as well, along with a bit of chocolate and a hint of vanilla. It's as if someone handed me a finely-crafted wood box with scenes of young Paraguayan women dancing naked (but tastefully) etched into the top, and without opening it I can tell that it's filled with an assortment of fine chocolates. In other words, the sweet woodsy character is enjoyable on its own, but there is also so much more goodness contained inside.  Being fairly finely carbonated, this one has a silky texture and goes down much smoother than would be expected at 12% alcohol. I enjoy this one more and more each time I try it.

Incredibly creamy with a lingering light bitterness that keeps the flavor going forever. A warming alcohol heat emanating from my stomach betrays the ABV. Aggressive carbonation that works well to lift this syrupy beast off the palate juuuust enough.  Fantastic brew, and probably my favorite from DFH. I'll be throwing some more bottles in the cellar, that's for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

It left sparse thin rings of lace. The smell had a hint of whiskey and the flavor finished with a sweet hint of vanilla. The feel was thick and smooth with a slightly bitter finish.  Palo Santo Marron is a wonderful and complex after-dinner sipper. It's heavy, boozy, and sweet without being overbearing. A great experience.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,OneDropSoup,4.3,"Poured into a DFH tulip pint: very dark brown with lighter brown highlights & a finger of mocha head that drops to a dusting with a tapioca collar.  Caramel & mild cocoa in the smell, a coffee-like roast bitterness, & some cooked fruit smells, like baking apple, raisin, dark cherry. A woody booze aroma wraps things up nicely. Smells are restrained, assertive but not aggressive.  Smell notes carry through into the flavor, but are way intensified & swirled together -- my mind's eye sees a tornado of these flavors, wrapped up in the wooden alcohol. Normally I see a strong booze presence in the taste as a detractor, but here I think it really adds & emphasizes the flavors. Pleasantly caramel, almost smoky aftertaste.  Medium bodied with a pleasant sting from the booze.  Dangerously drinkable, very smooth & tasty. The alcohol is not hidden, but still doesn't taste or feel like 12%. I don't know if this will make sense to anyone but me, but this is like the biggest little beer I've ever had (or maybe vice versa) -- full flavor, but leaving me wanting me more, doesn't feel full, but packs a punch with booze.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Lots of chocolate, malt and smoked wood taste. Warm finish to be expected with 12% abv.  Color is almost black with hints of burgandy if held to sunlight.  Seems like more of a porter than a brown ale.  Overall another great brew from the guys at DFH.

A: Small medium brown head that really resisted making an appearance. It was fizzy and didn't last long. The body was too dark to consider it's clarity and if it wasn't black, it was the darkest shade of brown imaginable. No lacing.  S: Heavy, nearly harsh malt character: molasses, darkly toasted bread and burnt caramel. Mild resiny hop profile overpowered by the malts and heavy yeast components of earth and leather aromas.  T: All over the flavor spectrum and somehow very cohesive. Flavors of campfire smoke, tar, reduced balsamic vinegar, vanilla, cherry flavored sugar free gum, strawberries and other fruity esters. The taste remains in your mouth until the next sip. Lightly sweet.  M: Full body with a sticky, chewy texture. Average level of carbonation, slightly fizzy, but silky and just right. A little chalky on the finish.  D: Intriguing brew definitely worth the experience but not really an easy drinker. And definitely not for everyone.

T: Roasted malts, caramel, lots of Palo Santo wood, and raisin/prune flavors. The finish is long and sweet and carries a little bitter mouth-drying woodyness. A little hot, but not bad for 12%. M: Thick and chewy and moderately carbonated (just about right).  I go back and forth on this beer a lot. I think it's a quality beer and a unique twist on the style. At times the wood can be a bit much, but other times it's a very enjoyable sipper.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

S: Spicy, peppery, almost a complex red wine smell. A few sweet dark fruits, maybe cherry? Alot going on here - the wood starts coming through as it warms up. Alcohol also present.  T: Alot of roasted malts. Wood! Cedar or some other type of wood. Almost what a plank cooked piece of food tastes like, but in a beer. A sweet finish - that gives off almost a cherry tartness. I guess that's why they say it's a malt beverage.  M: Chewy. The wood sits in your mouth as a campfire sits on your clothes. The sweetness in the finish thins out the feel a little bit.  D: A very interesting beer to say the least. I really don't know what style this fits in to. Supposedly a brown ale but way too complex for the style.

If you're looking for a session beer, look somewhere else. This one's a monster. The body and punch of this one is on par with Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout. It's simply huge.

10099,33832,cooncat,3.7,"Poured at fridge temp into a Sam Adams Boston lager glass .. my standard for doing samples. A thanks to fellow BA Adamette for the sample.  A vigorous pour down the middle of the glass had me wondering if I was going to get any head at all. However, I did wind up with maybe a quarter inch of burnt sugar colored head, which quickly dissapated into a thin broken cap. The brew itself is opaque .. I held a strong backlight to the glass, and nothing shows through. This is as dark as a stout. Some nice lacing decorates the glass with each sip. The lack of head is not unexpected in a 12% brew.  The nose is robust with sweet malty aromas (dark fruit, brown sugar, figs, dates) and a bit of alcohol.  Taste follows the nose pretty well. All manner of dark fruit sweet flavors assault the palate, along with some dark bread flavors (pumpernickle comes to mind). There is a bit of the alcohol in the taste, but it isn't objectionable or hot. Carbonation is on the low side, adding to the full and chewy mouthfeel. I can't give it a good score for drinkability, since this is pretty much a 'one and done' at 12%. This is NOT a session beer, but one to sit back and savor at the end of a hard day ... or any day.  I can appreciate the creativity of Sam C. over at Dogfish Head, using the special wooden vats to age this beer. I can't pick up anything special about the flavor, since I'm not familiar with the wood used (as opposed to say, oak).

Aroma is smokey dark malt, molasses, and rich dark fruit sweetness - black currant and plum. Quite complex. An unusual woody character that I have never encountered. Subdued cinnamon and vanilla spices.  Taste is similar to the nose but much more intense. Wow. Rich and velevety smokey quality. Toasted carmel malt with a peaty quality. Dark fruit from the nose is much more intense - black currant, plum, cherry and ripe blackberry are bursting with sweet fruit flavor. Finish holds a good bit of woody dryness, pine resin astringency, brown sugar and a brandy like alcohol presence.  Mouthfeel is smooth and slick.

The dawn is dark, deeply brown nearing a light black (...if such a hue is possible...), almost too dark for the circumstances, but lovely nonetheless. Spirits are high.

D-the flavors are pretty big but the alcohol shows through a little more than i would have liked. it takes away from the flavors, didn't like the addition of the smokiness at the finish and the wood brought a taste i wasn't too into. overall it wasn't bad; it was nice and thick, but the flavors didn't blow me away.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

The Bulnesia sarmientoi (commercially Argentinian Lignum Vitae, and locally Palo Santo) tropical hardwood imparts an unfamiliar, peculiar note to this ale.  T- Medicinal phenols dominate, along with fierce ethanol. That smoky, peculair Bulnesia sarmientoi wood note is apparent again. Burnt caramel, molasses, rum-soaked cherries. Faint coffee grounds, licorice. Long, bitter finish.  M, D- Like a Port, this ale is self-limiting to sipping at a slow pace. Creamy, viscous, syrupy and hot. Not to be trifled with, this may present a cumbersome level of drinkability to some.  The opportunity to sample different species of wood's influence upon an ale is interesting, however it has been reinforced to me that I still greatly prefer the influence of the noble White Oak (Quercus alba) to this tropical Palo Santo wood (Bulnesia sarmientoi).  The guayacol (oil of guaiac) in this tropical wood is an incense and perfume ingredient, and when oxidized it imparts a different characteristic on a beer, where as the White Oak brings an ale its creamy vanillin and oak lactones, and when the oak is toasted, rich coconut flavors.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

A bigger glass with a meal (lamb perhaps) and maybe this could have gone a different direction but this beer is overpriced.

10099,33832,feelmefoam,4.28,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a DFH specialty glass.  Palo Santo pours a dark, murky brown with minimal highlights. This isn't your mama's milk chocolate brown, this is deep, dark , opaque, nearly-black brown. Not much carbonation to be seen, but a pretty nice finger of light tan head gets pushed up, then slowly meanders away, leaving thick foamy lacing on the inside of the glass.  Smells of big, dark malts with chocolate and dark fruits. A slight earthiness behind it all as well. Pretty fragrant, but I don't smell anything that suggests being aged in a unique type of wood, like the label suggests.  The flavor is big and beautiful. There is an immediate bready malt flavor mixed with a sweet chocolate icing. Following this is a caramel and vanilla flavor (which the label says is from the wood). Finally, the beer finishes up with just a slight woody, earthy flavor. Very tasty.  The mouthfeel is also great. I like 'em thick, and this does it. For a beer that's 12% abv, you really can't tell because of the thick, creamy mouthfeel and the smoothness of the flavors. Not much carbonation to speak of, but that's fine, it adds to the overall silky characteristic of the beer.  Man, this is only my second beer from Dogfish (because they just recently started distributing to SC and their beers are mostly by the coast), but they did it right again. The label's correct; I now have wood.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

S: Candi sugar, malt, some toast. No coffee, no hops. Very dark-type smells.  T: Caramel, vanilla, dark fruit (grapes?!) and cherry. Some alcohol hotness, could use some age. A little oaky, I guess that's the palo santo wood.  M: Creamy, with perfect carbonation.  D: Very very good for the ABV, I may up this after I try it with some age on it, see if that mellows it out.  Ok, now May (that was January). Just gonna mention the important notes. I know it's not a lot of age, but a little.  A: Great 2 finger dark brown head with lots of concentrated bubbles.  S: Lot's of sweet molasses aroma here, maybe baked fruit as well.  T: I still get most of the taste from before, particularly actually the grapes, there is definitely a wine like character to this beer, and i think if it were flat I could pass it off as wine. I really want to up this to a 4.5 but I just can't.  M: Holding it's velvety carbonation really nicely.

T: Very interesting to say the least... the wood aging comes out with the first taste. tastes like dry barley/grain. With chocolate, and burned butterscotch.  M: Good on the thick side of things. Sticky lingering of the malts, and you can feel the sting form the alcohol.  D: Though I find this beer to be a pleasant experience, it does not rank high as a beer that I would want to drink regularly, or in a social setting where I might prefer to have 2-4 beers.

M: Full bodied, little carbonation, warms the mouth and stomach.

10099,33832,yelterdow,4.64,"Bottled on 09/09/08. Served in the brewery's own oversize snifter a little over an hour out of the fridge.  Appearance- Dark like the richest of chocolates, this dense brew pours with just a thin, cocoa head that retreats out to the rim within a minute. It's a thick, massive beer without a doubt... the liquid even looks heavy as I swirl it around. The beer does lace in various places in the glass.  Smell- There's an enormous amount of interesting aromas to identify here... I am getting bacon, smoked meat, wood, vanilla, and what seems to be brewer's licorice. The oversize snifter is key here, as its design fits perfectly for the beer's incredible complexity.  Taste- If the nose could unfurl its wondrous bounty over the tongue, the result would be the flavors happening in my mouth right now. A densely packed suitcase of vanilla, roasted malts, wooden barrels, cured meats, and some residual booze rolls over the tongue, leaving behind a lingering hop bitterness that dries things up nicely. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Viscous and sublime, the rich liquid is gently nudged with a rolling, easy carbonation that creates a velvety, almost silky texture. This beer is so huge, so packed with ingredients and flavor that it must be respected and enjoyed properly. I am basking in the joy of each sip, and cannot wait to sample this again with capicola and fennel... ahh, the joys of being a foodie and beer lover.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

One or two at dinner with a medium rare piece of red meat (beef, lamb, goat if you will) would be lovely  Cellar Review: 9/18/2016 10/2014 bottling; almost 2 years old served at cellar temps in a balloon glass  Appearance: super dark brown with a foamy khaki head clinging to the glass. oily top and tons of legs  Nose: wood for days, rich and chocolaty, roasted malts, vanilla and alcohol, spicy character, graham cracker  Taste: graham cracker, boozy but not in a bad way or like you would get from a spirit barrel aged beer, walnut, chocolate, roasty, rich, dark roast coffee, coconut, oaky, char, vanilla, strong vanilla beans, very malty, slightly acrid or astringent, spicy finish with some lingering caramel. Medium body and a light finish.  Overall: this beer really falls off the radar for most people. It is a year round available, barrel aged imperial brown ale/imperial stout from a world class brewery in 4-packs for under $16! This stuff should not be hanging around on the shelves. I think it is better that a lot of the limited available barrel imperial stouts out there and way cheaper per oz. This beer is killer value and I'm going to go but more for my cellar. I think it will last for years in there and improve because of the ABV, barrel character, roasty quality and phenols.

Nose is very malty with chocolate, a hint of caramel, currants, and raisins.  Taste is chocolate, caramel, licorish, and vanilla up front with a light dry hop finish leaving a slightly lingering bitterness on the palate. The 12% abv certainly adds some heat that doesn't escape notice in the flavor profile either.  The mouthfeel is a bit creamy for the style but still good.

10099,33832,swhite11,3.64,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz. bottle.  [A] - Pours a dark, syrupy mahogony that appears cola black in the glass. Head pours a creamy, tan, 1 finger film that does not retain for a substantial amount of time. Lacing is average at best.  [A] - Caramel malt sweetness dominates on a bready malt foundation. Faint notes of licorice, vanilla, cinnamon, and Palo Santo wood as well. However, these last stated nuances are all VERY faint with the exception of vanilla.  [T] - Very sweet up front as the caramel malts become a bit cloying. Hops are only present in bittering chracteristics and balance the sweetness. The hops, alcohol and Palo Santo wood combine to dry the finish and diminish the cloying characteristic of the malt. Alcohol is drying but not at all boozy or even warming.  [M] - Dextrins are creamy up front. The alcohol and wood both slice through to dry the beer and add balance. Carbonation is subdued up front, but is preceived as a bit spritzy back palate.  [D + 0] - 12% abv. is hidden exceptionally well. Perhaps the best example of hiding a high alcohol content that I've ever seen (Tasted).

10099,33832,Pahn,4.44,"12 fl. oz. bottle into Duvel tulip. Bottled on date illegible.  Appearance: Solid black brown, with a 1/2 inch tan head that disappears almost immediately. Spots and streaks of lacing.  Smell: Smokey, spicy, woody. Some cherry and yellow cake, but predominantly wood notes. Really nice. The smell boasts of the wood aging even more strongly than the label.  Taste: A soft, full taste of vanilla, cherry, malt, caramel, and sugar with a warm and smokey alcohol hit at the end. You can really taste how the aging mellows and deepens the flavor of the beer; this is why brewers age beer in wooden barrels. This beer is an answer to people trying to claim that this technique is gimmicky and superfluous. The flavor is deep, lush, and beautiful. The smooth, woody notes are balanced by the alcohol and spice.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and chewy, with hot alcohol and minimal carbonation.  Drinkability: It's a heavy hitting beer, but as long as it keeps delivering, I'm happy to keep drinking.  ---  I've recently read a lot of posts online about Dogfish Head being an overrated brewery.

Not sure all the flavors are complementary, namely the sweet fruit alongside the oaky/phenolic/alky side.  M - medium to full body, borderline chewy, sweet oily residue  D - about average for a 12%.

T- Strong tasting beer, alcohol dominates this beer almost to a point that all other flavors are barely allowed to surface. The hints of vanilla from the oak aging are barely allowed to come through along with the other roasted flavor. Although with these problems, the longer it warms, the better it tastes.

10099,33832,SkeeterHawk,4.44,"I bought a whole 4-pack of this beer and drank one after a couple other IIPA's a couple weeks ago, and this beer was undoubtedly the ""nail in my coffin"" that night. I have been a bit cautious to try it again since, but I have only had a couple low-gravity beers tonight, so now's the time.  Appearance: As the beer was pouring, you could see that it was a relatively clear dark reddish brown color, but after it is in the glass it could pass for a robust porter. There was a small head of tan bubbles around the edge of the glass right after the pour, but these faded into a small ring after about a half-minute.  Aroma: I initially got some dark cherry and some spice that makes it come across as much like a dessert as anything. After the beer sits for a bit, I get an entirely different aroma with some vanilla and a really nice fresh woody scent. As the beer sits a little bit more, there are some cocoa notes coming out as well as some spiciness from the alcohol. The aroma is amazingly complex for this beer, and it is surprising in regards to the ABV that it boasts. This beer has an incredible aroma, and one that would be inviting in a number of different culinary expressions. Excellent!  Taste: The flavor is much more balanced and palatable than the aroma suggested it would be...though the aroma was not harsh by any means. I expected the dark malts to be a big player in this beer, but instead, there is some distinct fruitiness , vanilla, and a subtle bitter chocolate that gives balance to the whole ensemble. This beer is bold, and even after only a few sips, I can feel flushing in my cheeks...indicating that it is a strong one. The alcohol is definitely there in the finish as warming, but this beer really masks the super high ABV that it really has.  Opinion: This is an excellent and well crafted beer. I like the depth of flavor and regardless of how he got it, Sam has a winner with this one. A wood aged American brown ale is a good description for this beer, but it has the typical super-hoppy ""American"" character to the side to let the malt and the wood accents shine through.

Wood and chocolate still dominate. I get notes of toasted malts and vanilla as well. T: More 'brown ale' flavors that I remember it having fresh. The alcohol doesn't dominate as much anymore. I get notes of wood, roasted malt, caramel, toasted grains and raisins with a touch of strong alcohol and sweet sugar bringing up the finish. Still fairly sweet overall but at least the alcohol has calmed down. M: Thick body, fairly smooth mouthfeel with even, fluffy carbonation. Goes down well, with only a few rough edges of alcohol. O: Much better with a little bit of age on it opposed to fresh. I know my palate has changed a lot since I first had this beer a year and a half ago, but I remember it being a bit rough. Not the greatest imperial brown out there, but I think this will get even better with even more age on it. The longer you can wait to open this the better.

10099,33832,hustlesworth,3.58,"A- deep and black like a stout, and with an aggressive pour i got a huge dense bubbly coffee-with-cream colored head that shrinks down at a decent pace thanks to the high abv i assume. lots of wavy splotches of lace are left behind. not a hint of light is visible through the bottom of my tulip. super dark.  S- an interesting spicy aroma, very phenolic, and somewhat familiar, yet i'm having trouble associating it with anything else. some sort of plant resin. and spice. peppercorn, dried oranges, sandalwood, cedar, caraway, and pine tar. it must be the palo santo wood. its very vaporous, and gets carried up the nostrils by alcohol. perhaps it's the aroma of some incense of days gone by, more like an altogether chemical solvent aroma, like... bug spray. not really bad, just... different. beneath that is nutty roasted goodness of a big brown ale and lots of alcohol vapor. some caramel and vanilla yeah yeah but the aroma is dominated by the resinous smell of the wood.  T- taste is equally as interesting. anise-like caraway and dried orange peel make up the wood flavors for me, and the essential oils of this holy tree must be pretty strong stuff. very solvent like in aroma and flavor. i'm not sure if i like it or not due to the chemical taste. on the big brown ale side, it's hugely roasted and nicely bitter, burnt peanuts and molasses, earthy herbal hops, bitterness 3 ways from the roast, the hops, and the alcohol, and at the same time sweetness from the alcohol esters and malt. finishes all roasted and boozy with some lingering hop flavor and more of that damn wood. to suit my tastes, the palo santo wood could be tuned down just a bit more. its overtakes the aroma and plays much too big of a role in the flavor profile. but it's definitely unique.  MF- luxurious, full, and creamy, delicate carbonation, and full of tannins. DFH website likens this to an oak aged cab and that's exactly what it feels like. i can feel the wood and grape skin on my cheeks, dryness from the alcohol, vinous alpha acids. and a solvent medicinal feeling from that... wood.  D- don't know how to feel about this one. without a doubt it's well crafted, and i can always appreciate coloring outside the lines. the woody resinous spicy sweetness gets to me in a strange way and i'm on the fence that divides like and dislike. i'd turn down another, but i'm glad that i tried one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,BeerInReview,4.33,"A: Pours a thick dark brown with just a little less than a finger worth of a creamy dark tan head that fades quickly.  S: Has a strong malty aroma and another smell I haven't smelt before. I can smell the vanilla but there's also a woody smell there too. Very different smell...it might be the palo santo wood. I can also smell the 12% ABV.  T: Wow. This is a different tasting beer, in a good way. The first thing I can taste is the sweet malt but it is quickly melded with a taste of wood. Very different from oak that's for sure. This is much more complex than my taste buds can discern. The alcohol is very well hidden and melds well.  M: A full bodied beer. It has a syrupy texture and leaves me with a warm feeling (must be the 12% ABV).  D: For me, usually barrel aged beer I can enjoy one or two in a sitting, but I think I could drink this all night.

Sweet raisiny aromas, along with a really nice roasty character, some woodiness, and a rich malty sweetness. Some noticeable alcohol in the background.  Flavors are dominated by a sweet, raisiny malt, along with some molasses, faint wood, hazelnut and a bit of alcohol in the finish.  Full-bodied with a sticky, syrupy texture on the palate. some warmth from that high abv.

10099,33832,luchris80,4.08,"Tasting Notes: Stored in the fridge, allowed to warm a bit and served in a pint glass (per Dogfish site recommendation).  Aroma: Light aroma overall (from what I expected). Full, malty nose with some roasty/toasted notes. Sweetness that is caramel or brown sugar-like.  Appearance: Black in color (very, very, very dark brown). One finger, very thick, light coffee color head with great retention that leaves a trail. Opaque, even when held to light.  Flavor: Heavy, malty sweetness with no noticeable hops. Earthy, woodiness near finish that hangs on for a bit. Can tell that wood vessel aging was involved. Some dryness at finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate (to high) carbonation. Quite creamy and somewhat smooth. Warmth noticed at the end - back of mouth into the throat.  Overall Impressions: Really a lot going on here (more than I can pick out). It is similar to other barrel aged beers, but very different as well. A very good beer for sitting in front of a fireplace at the end of an evening or enjoying after dinner with a cigar. Would have served it in an oversized wine glass and likely will for the next time.

10099,33832,Seanibus,3,"Wow. Weird. Weird and Weird. But I like. I think.  I had a really weird reaction to this beer - it caused me my mouth to water. Not like in anticipation, but like in it made my mouth produce a huge amount of spit. How is this possible? I have never had this reaction to anything, ever. Weird.  So anyway.  Pours inky black with a very slight head that falls away quickly. The aroma was ever so familiar, so I sniffed and sniffed. And then I came up with it - lilacs. It reminded me of spring at my grandmother's house.  The flavor was woody and lilac like, with a sweet, smokey, perfumy character. And of course, it made my mouth water furiously, causing me to slobber embarrassingly as I attempted to describe my first sip to my companions. The finish, besides being a little spit soaked, is bitter and malted, like a deep burnt caramel. There's a waft of vanilla back up the throat. The alcoholic punch is readily apparent, though it is less like beer than like a dark, blackstrap rum.  The mouthfeel clings, even as my mouth is fighting back with spit.  Did I mention it makes my mouth water?  Is this a good beer? Jeez, I don't know. I don't expect to drink another of these, but I would say it is worth a try.  I would probably have rated it higher overall without the whole spit thing, which I must admit is a huge turnoff.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,MbpBugeye,4.06,"Bottled on 04/07/09 printed on the neck so this beer has about 8 months in the bottle.  A- 1 finger deep tan head. It doesnt stick around very long. It fades to just a collar. The beer is a really dark brown thats just about black.  S- At first its really strong on notes of wet wood. There is also a noticeable amount of alcohol in the smell. There are lots of other complexities in this aroma. Chocolate and licorice are also apparent.  T- Coffee, wood and alcohol are the strongest flavors here. Licorice, chocolate and some hops and roasty bitterness finish out the palate. Notes of chocolate and wood linger. This is a very rich brew.  M- Pretty smooth considering the burn of the alcohol which is quite strong. Finishes semi-dry with a stickiness left on the lips. This is pretty heavy, I can feel it in my stomach.  D- Big burn of alcohol here. Its also quite rich and hard to drink fast, but thats a good thing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,jeffthecheff,3.52,"12 oz bottle, about 6 months old. The beer pours into my tulip with a very dark, chestnut brown color and a dark tan head. The consistency is fluffy at first but dies down to just a border around the tulip.  The aroma is very strong and yeasty. There is a burnt brown sugar or molasses. I'm also picking up a distinct cigar like aroma as well. Heat from the alcohol is also there, detracting from the aroma a bit.  The first thing I thought when sipping this beer is that its incredibly hot. I also tried this beer side by side with a 1.5 yr old bottle and found that even that much time isn't enough, and didn't really do too much. I would say this needs at least 3-5 years of aging. The flavors of this beer are really interesting though. There is a big roast, a bit of chocolate, and a strong nutty character. I'm not sure what the wood adds to the beer, but I'm betting some of the things I'm tasting come from the wood aging.  Palo Santo is big and rich with a burning finish. This is a very slow, hour plus long sipper. I'll probably stash my other bottles for 5 years and see how it does.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

The alcohol wasn't too present despite being 12% ABV. There's also a subtle hop finish. Overall, it has a very similar flavor to New Holland's Dragon's Milk Ale. (A good thing in my book.)  Mouthfeel: Medium thickness and viscosity. Coats the mouth nicely, but doesn't leave your chest burning.  Overall, it's a surprisingly drinkable beer: creamy, hoppy, and packs a punch.

There is also a distinct moist woody smell in my glass as the result of the Palo Santo wood aging. Spices are evident.  M - light carbonation with a warm spicy alcohol feel. You can feel the bite to the alcohol in your mouth  T- This starts with a malty warm alcohol bite but smooths out nicely with a spicy woody finish. There are hints of fruity and vanilla in this extreme brown ale.  D - Very complex taste that is perfect for a cold fall or winter evening by the fire but the alcohol will catch up to you so be careful.

10099,33832,irishking1977,3.9,"Part of a mixed six pack. I've had this unique beer before, but thought I'd lend my two cents on this one this time.  A: Pours a garnet, black and brown with a chocolate milk head. I don't recall this beer looking this good the last time I had it. Very nice.  S: Licorice with hints of wood and chocolate along with subtle alcohol. This is a big beer. The alcohol should peek it's way out. The folks at Dogfish Head did a good job hiding it.  T: Chocolate, fruit and wood with a hint of licorice. I'm not a fan of licorice at all, but the notes of it in this one is okay with me. This is good stuff to savor.  M: Smooth and rich with decent carbonation. Goes down nicely with a slight alcohol burn. Certainly not nearly a burn as it should be considering the 12% abv.  D: Two or three of these would make most, if not all people call it quits. I'd venture to say that after two of these bad boys I'd be good to go.

Should have read the label more closely in regards to content but anyway...  Appearance - gorgeous brown color nearly black and has a toffee colored head which is minimal and has slight lacing  Smell - smell is exactly like a traditional ale and very complex in all the flavors going on  Taste - sweet, light, fragrant, malty and yet extremely hoppy all at the same time. In the beginning you get all the complex flavors but then at the end the alcohol really started to come through. Made it a bit tough to keep drinking but was lovely none the less.  Mouthfeel - good amount of carbonation however I regretted swishing it around for a bit b/c it let the alcohol sit and when I finished I tasted pure alcohol.  Drinkability - perhaps one of the most unique beers I've had and just as great as I would expect from Dogfish Head.

10099,33832,BlackBearForge,4.23,"Palo Santo Marron, what a unique beer, perhaps should be described as an Imperial Brown. It pours much like a stout, dark and thick, a deep deep brown, nearly black in the glass with just the barest impression of deep ruby around the edges with a creamy chocolate colored head which leaves thick but slippery lacing and forms a foamy collar as it falls which stays to the end.  The aroma is interesting, with dark malts smelling of brandy, hints of chocolate, caramel and dark fruits, also a bit boozy.  The flavor is also unique and quite tasty, especially as it warms up. Dark roasted malts, but not bitter as you would find in a stout, dark brandied fruits (plums and raisins), nice vanilla and hints of chocolate, caramel and licorice along with an additional flavoring, smooth, dark and somewhat woody which must be from the palo santo wood tanks. Somewhat boozy from the 12 % ABV but the alcohol enhances the flavors, weaving in and out, and provides just the smallest amount of heat on the tongue.  Mouthfeel is medium but toward the heavy side and silkily smooth, I mean really really smooth with light carbonation lending a touch of creaminess.  Palo Santo Marron I thought wouldn't be too drinkable because of it's high ABV but it is the exact opposite. It is dangerously drinkable as it warms and the flavors smooth out into the alcohol.

There's no call for a beer to be this sweet and savory and with a bit of hop bite in the front after the swallow and plenty of esters to carry the flavors around your palette and into your nose and throat. This is a truly excellent beer.  M: Thick and gloriously viscous, like drinking eggnog or heavy cream. Heavy like a good espresso with a splash of heavy cream in it.  D: Insane for a 12% alcohol beer to be this drinkable. This will go down by the mouthful if you aren't careful to savor it.  Overall: Will buy again.

Flavor: Similar to the aroma, very complex. Tons of dark malty flavors up front and as it warmed the woodsy character and vanilla, dried fruits, and molasses came out more. The alcohol was more mellow than when I tried it a year ago (in a pleasant way).  Mouthfeel/Finish: Full bodied with a lingering alcohol warming.

Wait, 12%? you coulda have told me this was 7% and I'd believe it. Has some very nutty maltiness to it and then the finish from the palo wood gives it a very sweet, almost cherry fruitiness to it. Has a light carbonation perfect for a brown.  This was the first ""extreme"" beer I ever really had, and coming back to it over a year later this thing still blows me away.

Behind some alcohol warmth, there's a very earthy malt taste. The warming is intense, although the beer doesn't really get 'hot'. Fruits come out more in the flavor.

Appearance- Pours a near pitch black with a small quickly dissipating brown head. Nice lacing left on the glass.  Smell- Extremely sweet smell with a lot of roasted nuts and a dark wood.  Taste- Alot like it smells with an almond taste and a very sweet wood aftertaste. Unfortunately, as the beer warms it becomes much boozier in flavor, to the point it's almost like a brandy. Which is the reason for only the 3.5.  Mouthfeel- Thick and oily with mild carbonation tingling the tongue on the forefront and after taste.  Drinkability- For high ABV, this beer early on has an almost unnoticeable booze taste to it, becoming very dangerous for someone such as myself. However, as I said earlier as it warms the booze overpowers the other flavors. For this reason it's a sipper for sure but almost a ""quick sipper"" so to speak.

A full body that is low on the carbonation. Very rich, creamy, and velvety smooth. The alcohol shows, but it is a great beer to sip",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,brystmar,3.82,"This was a very interesting drink, to say the least. Purchased this bottle from a large beer/liquor vendor out of state, and only just now noticed its ""bottled on"" date was 07/24/08, so this beer had a long shelf life.  A: Claims to be a brown beer, but it poured a jet black color into my pint glass. Head was brownish and pretty minimal. Low carbonation, moderate lacing.  S: Smell was the only weak point of this beer. The alcohol bites you (harshly) right off the bat, followed by a very distinct woody cognac smell with hints of vanilla and cocoa. This beer smells nothing like most others, and honestly I didn't find it very pleasant. May have something to do with its nearly 1.5-year shelf life before reaching my glass.  T: Given the smell, I wasn't expecting to enjoy this beer, but I went in with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. It's surprisingly smooth and hardly bites -- despite its ABV -- but its alcoholic nature becomes more prevalent as it warms. Tons of flavors here: cocoa, smokey wood (I'm assuming Palo Santo wood), and traces of vanilla, among others. Very complex and, again, surprisingly smooth for a 12% beverage.  M: This is a full-bodied beer with good texture overall. Not much else to say here.  D: Dangerous. Very, very dangerous. This beer is deceptively easy to drink; I had NO idea that this was 12% ABV until seeing it at the top of this page to write this review. It's labeled as such at the bottom of the bottle right next to the ""12 fluid oz"" marking, so I must've lumped the 12s together as standard packaging items to ignore upon reading the label. Otherwise, this beer could be quite sessionable.  A great beer; I'll be buying this again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,hckyfn9999,4.22,"Pours a very dark brown with about a finger of tan colored head. Aroma of vanilla, cocoa powder, there is an oak like smell that I assume is the palo santo wood, caramel, a slight touch of alcohol, and a bit of fruit.  Taste is as complex as the smell. Any hint of booze noticed in the aroma is absent on the palate. Lots of complex malt flavors. Slightly roasted, caramel, vanilla, burnt sugar, a bit of spiciness, bittersweet cocoa, some fruit (kind of berry like), and there is also a very faint, scotch-like, peat smokiness. About as perfect of a mouthfeel as you will find. It is full bodied and creamy with a perfect carbonation level. A very complex and interesting beer. A high price tag will keep me from purchasing this a lot, but I will pick it up again at some point.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,BeanBone,4.3,"Appearance: A thick, inky black body that only lets a trace amount of red-hued light escape. It's capped by a finger of rich tan head that leaves a few patches of lacing. Far from brown, this looks more like an Imperial Stout than a Brown Ale.  Aroma: Boozy, woody and malty; this is complex and inviting.  Taste: I've never heard of Palo Santo wood before, but from what I can tell it has a similar effect on beer that more plebeian woods do, that is to say it lends the brew vanilla and ""woody"" notes. There's also plenty of character coming from the alcohol, but despite the massive percentage, it never dominates the flavor profile. While this is far from a traditional Brown Ale, I can see this family resemblance. I suppose you could call the beer underlying all of the fireworks a Brown Ale on steroids, or in the parlance of our time, an ""Imperial Brown."" The aftertaste is a brilliant mix of oaky and boozy notes.  Mouthfeel: A somewhat syrupy, full body with decent carbonation and some good burn coming from the alcohol.  Drinkability: Solidly in sipper territory, this is a beer that demands your attention.  Verdict: I had high hopes for this beer, and they certainly didn't go unfulfilled. Palo Santo Marron is a big, bad brew with plenty of complexity and personality coming from the wood and booze. A twelve percent Brown Ale aged on exotic Paraguayan wood is the kind of madness we've come to expect, and the result is just as good too. I can't wait to see how this ages in the cellar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,SkunkWorks,3.8,"Poured a dark brown with very little head that left no lacing in my glass. The small head, which was a dark brown (what you'd expect from a porter or stout) disappeared very quickly. It seemed hardly carbonated. In the aroma, I mostly got the smell of the alcohol with some woodiness. As for the taste, the alcohol was very apparent as was the taste of the wood. There is also some coffee flavors and roasted malts in there as well. It was a little difficult to drink, as the flavor of the alcohol which is apparent at the start comes forward more as the beer warms up.  This beer reminded me more of a porter than a brown ale. Personally, I think this was a good beer but I probably would not have again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Riccymon,4.1,"Pours from the bottle a deep brown with almost no head surviving the pour. Smell is a little on the dull side, though what is there is sweet and a little caramely, a little peaty. Also present is some cherry, a bit of alcohol, and a flavor that reminds of banana and banana cream pie, more specifically.  Upon sipping, flavors of rye bread, dark fruit, and shelled nuts are most evident. About a quarter into the glass, I figured out that what Palo Santo most reminds me of is a Belgian dubbel. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, almost like syrup or cream on the tongue. Alcohol leaves the mouth tingling, but it's nowhere to be found in the taste, much to my surprise. While it does sip like a bigger beer, I found it extremely drinkable. Nicely done, DFH!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,PretzelsNBeer,4,"Definitely a unique brew which probably isn't for the average joe beer drinker.  The pour into my pint glass revealed a very dark beer with tan head. As I took a whiff of the beer I noticed a port like smell which lead me to expect a very sweet wine like taste. The first taste that I took, I got the initial kick in the teeth that a 12% beer gives. But after the initial alcoholic burn gave way, I started to taste a depth of flavor...vanilla, woody, slight roasted-ness. It ain't yer average beer. Especially as the temperature of the beer warms do the flavors really start to come out and the initial burn of the 12% starts to mellow greatly. 3/4 thru the pint the flavor of this beer is really popping and there's such an earthiness to it which really masks the potency; hardly any semblence of a high octane beer here. It's a very full bodied beer with layers of flavor profiles. The mouthfeel is obviously on the full bodied side but isn't like syrup. This leads to the drinkability of this bad boy, despite it's high percentage of alcohol, this beer is very drinkable as it warms in temperature. The balanced complex flavors and undaunting mouthfeel make this beer worthy to frequent consumption however moderation should be taken into account.

S: notes of wood come first along with roasted barley, maple, brown sugar, and a healthy touch of booziness  T: like the nose, the wood precedes other flavors. This has a very complex flavor and it would be hard to put a finger on every flavor I tasted. I did pick up a good deal of vanilla along with roasted malts and maple. At the end some heat from the high abv comes through, it is balanced quite nicely though.  MF: thick, velvety, almost creamy. This is a very thick bodied beer, the flavors work well.  D: definitely high on the alcohol content, but given the way it tastes i wouldn't have guessed more than 9%.

10099,33832,beerthulhu,4.25,"A: From the bottle poured a dark prune juice color with radish highlights around the edges. In the glass appeared opaque (black) with a coppery-tan head, 1 finger high that was moderately lasting but lacked any lacing.  S: The nose was spicy dark fruit (fresh prunes, raisins), burnt wood with oaky sherry notes. Hints of burnt chocolate were also evident and prominent.  T: The flavor opens with a burnt woodiness and silky wet ashes (in a very good way) with a vinous dried grape alcohol nature. Juicy plums, vanilla and sherry cask notes along with a scorched offering of roasted barley come through with a very smooth bitterness. Hints of sweetness are supplied by burnt caramel while dark licorice notes compliment nicely here. The finish is smooth and bitter, with an earthy minerality, that was dry and loaded with roasted barley grains and a touch of sweet alcohol and black cherries. Overall a very complex offering that was sweet, bitter, earthy with a spicy alcohol finale that was loaded with dark fruit and a smooth layering of transition from start to finish.  M: a light consistency and a slippery slick texture that rolled around effortlessly on the tongue with little resistance. Very smooth and void of any carbonation gives this a silky smooth feel.  D: Drinks like a fine wine at 12.0%abv you'll feel the dark vinous nature and warmth this has to offer as well a deep layering and complexity. Warm this up in a chalice for best results.

Strong lacing, both above the beer and on the sides of the glass as I tip to take a sip.  S: caramel malt, vanilla and butterscotch, with hints of chocolate and brown sugar. Aromas of warm alcohol- evidence of the wood barrel aging.  T: very much like the aroma- caramel, vanilla, chocolate and butterscotch. No doubt this is a high ABV brew, alcohol announces its presence with authority- maybe not quite as much as Goose Island Bourbon County Stout or DFH World Wide Stout, but there's no doubt this is an alcoholic beverage. No hops detected, though admittedly I have a hard time detecting hops in beers such as Palo Santo (rich, malty beers). I don't get any bitterness on the back end that would suggest a hop presence.  M: full bodied and smooth, with just a tad of dryness at the back end. Perhaps a bit too much tingle of carbonation, but I'm nitpicking at this point as I only noticed that on a few sips throughout. Really kicks the saliva glands into overdrive with each successive sip, very thick and a bit sticky on the lips.  D: wow, this is a good freakin' beer. I can imagine enjoying this brew with some high-end chocolate or some smoked gouda or havarti cheese, maybe a nice aged cheddar.

Half an inch of very brown head, clears out very quickly though, and leaves no lacing. When tilting the glass to take a sip, a layer of the beer slowly climbs down the interior wall of the glass, giving evidence to the thickness of the beer. Tints the glass brown.  Smell: There's something I can't put my finger on that is absolutely phenomenal about the smell of this beer. I've had it once before and I don't remember it smelling this good. All I can really say to define it is a very sweet, creamy molasses, vanilla, a bit of spice and smokey wood, but mostly just a milky sweetness to the nose. Mmm. Wonderful.  Taste: Candy corn! This definitely has a bakers rack complexity of sweeter flavors, molasses, vanilla and caramel. I get a fruity apple acidity aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Only thing I really don't like about this beer is the carbonation. Too much prickly carbonated texture for such a creamy smelling beer.  Drinkablity/Overall: I could really get used to having this often. I love the smell so much that I don't want to finish this glass off.

I think its a mistake to judge a head just in some normal glass the first time you have it. you have to poor it in other glasses too! esp if they have the lazer etched bottom.  smell, I smell wood, vanilla and brown sugar. you can really smell and taste the wood in this if you drink 12+ year scotch.  the wood smell and taste is not that of oak. its of another wood, a wood that is more exotic to my pallet. it lends a strange and wonderful flavor that masks the alcohol taste quite well. I can also taste figs and other dryed fruit. A great taste you would never know its a 12% abv  mouth its really not that heavy more a mediium body with good carbonation and small bubbles of carbonation not big  you know if I was given this in a taste test I would guess its 7 - 10 % abv because of the taste but if this was a 6-8 % abv I could see drinking 2 or 4 of these sinces its 12% you cant drink more then 2 of them.  all and all a great beer I highly reccomend it in dogfish head glasses the wood itself lets it to making the 12% beer more smooth just as in a 12 year old scotch is more smooth.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

T- Dark fruits and coffee roasted flavors are what's most upfront. Vanilla has a nice flavor just behind that. Leaves a very nice flavor in the mouth.  M- Nice thick and smooth, creamy feel. It benefits, from a fairly weak level of carbonation, about the perfect amount for this beer I think.  D- Very enjoyable. I'm glad I bought a 4 pack.

10099,33832,marvin213,4.39,"It's a really dark brown ale--virtually black. The foam cap quickly fizzled, but residuals affixed to the glass sides create an ominous tunneling effect. In all fairness, it's too dark a brown and the head offers only minimal retention. It's neat enough, however, to look better than your average brown.  I smell impressively warm vanilla alcohol. It's like an alcoholic dessert prior to reduction. Woody caramel makes its way off the surface as well. The Palo Santo wood smell reminds me of a big, empty salad-serving bowl. The way in which this wood imparts its influence to food (and drink) is remarkable. Even while chilled and served directly from mini-fridge, the aroma proves uniquely solid.  The 12% ethanol buzzes with warmth and swirls the flavors. This serving is cold, and I feel it more than I taste it. I definitely experience that unique Palo Santo wood. It's almost as if I'm tipping up my aforementioned salad bowl in lieu of a pint glass. I could scoop this beer out with a big fork and spoon. It's unique in that vanilla and caramel are so pronounced without it being overly sweet. Rather than sugary syrup slowing me down, it's the alcohol. It might be a bit high-voltage for a brown, and it's definitely different than most. A really neat concoction, and kudos to DFH for doing it.  This woody dessert slammed with alcohol makes for among the coolest mouthfeels I've ever experienced. The alcohol really swirls the cake-like flavors on a Palo Santo backbone. A flagship DFH production, this beverage exemplifies extreme craft brewing--liquid dessert thru a salad bowl that buzzes you. If this is off-centered, I'll stay away from the mainstream.  It's a big beer, and its flavorful impact inhibits overdoing it. You're not reaching for two in a row of this one, but you want it on hand for appropriate occasions like sharing with friends. It's so neat and so good. Its power, in regards to every component that constitutes it, however, hampers the frequency with which you'll grab the Palo Santo.

10099,33832,PartyBear,3.78,"Appearance: Dark oaky brown, verging on black, with a small tan head that shows good retention. 4  Aroma: There are clear notes of brown malts, with lots of chocolate and toffee. Also, there is a certain dairy element to the aroma, some thick cream, however, along with this there is a bit of a strange one, which comes across as slightly gluey and plasticy. 3.5  Taste: The taste really doesn't match the nose, there seems to be no trace of the sweet malts, its taste is more dominated by the alcohol, along with a slightly medicinal twang. There are some oaky, woody flavours that a probably derived from the barrel aging. There is also a detectable hint of vanilla flavouring, and some aniseed. Oh, hang on, there is a bit of chocolate in the aftertaste, so maybe the malts have a say after all. Very unique, that is for sure. 4  Mouthfeel: Sticky and heavy in the mouth. No real carbonation, which leave it oily and smooth. 4  Drinkability: As you would expect from DFH this is a very unique beer, I haven't tasted anything like it before. The taste and the aroma seem to be from completely different beer, it's very surreal.

Smell is pretty crazy: a bit malty, dark fruits, some vanilla, spice, and a couple other things I can't label. All this is accompanied by an almost harsh woodyness. The beer does a good job on the wood flavors, with the sweet fruits on deck, followed by some lighter ideas of chocolate and malt. The beer has some bite too it, but not because of the alcohol, although it does have a warming effect that is enjoyable. The mouthfeel doesn't stray far from the style, maybe it's a bit heavier that other brown ales I've had, but that lines up neatly with the other characteristics of this beer.

10099,33832,BBThunderbolt,4.13,"Poured into 10oz glass. Poured black (absolutely black, I've had stouts lighter in color than this) with about 1/4 inch of medium brown head that dissipated quickly and left minimal lacing.  A lot of different aromas here. Very rich and deep scents. Upfront is a pleasant roastiness. A sweet licorice follows, then a couple of scents I can't put my finger on. The flavors follow closely, a little sweeter than the aroma prepared me for. Surprisingly neutral in the middle of the tongue. The licorice taste lingers on the back of the tongue, gently.  Body is very good, full and thick without being heavy or chewy. Drinkability is very good, this is not a palate wrecker, but at 12% I can't see having more than 2, if that many.  Overall, an excellent beer that should be tried and sought out. The appearance score suffers for looking like a stout instead of a brown ale. If this beer were called a stout, I couldn't see anyone disagreeing. A must try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Real malty in the nose...smells sweet, like molasses and fruit, and some wood aroma in there too. The taste follows the nose. Sweet, followed by oakiness. Tastes like vanilla, molasses, figs (?), and almost chocolaty. Real nice mouthfeel. Creamy smooth with only a hint of carbonation. Leaves quite a bit of stick behind, but drinks real easy for such a strong dark beer. A real nice drinking experience.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,BedetheVenerable,4.02,"Presentation: 12oz brown pop top with nice info about the beer on the label...bottled on 10/23/08...poured into a Duvel tulip  Appearance: Probably the darkest Brown Ale I've ever seen...pours a thick dark chocolate color, but is nearly black and almost completely impervious to light once in the glass...capped by a big dark tan cap which fades to a thick ring and film with nice retention...a little bit of sediment in the bottom 1/3 of the glass as well  Smell: Oh my word, this is...wow...it's super rich, chocolaty, with some massive, rummy caramel tones in here as well as a touch of biscuit...it's almost more like a Barleywine without the hops...some dark fruit in here as well...unbelievably rich and vibrant aromas, yum!  Taste: Much fruitier than I expected, with dark fruits and dark caramel malts up front, with some somewhat hot, prickly booze as well...on the tail end there's some nice sharp bitter roastiness which you don't get at all at first...some big fruit on the finish as well, I can't quite put my finger on it, as well as some brownie batter as well...some mild/medium hop bitterness, but this one's all about the malts. A bit of charred woodsiness after this leaves the palate, as well as some lightly roasted coffee. This kind of reminds me (hear me out on this one) of what Sam Adams Triple Bock might be like without all the crazy/scary soy sauce flavors...it's got that awesome chocolaty, rummy, boozy fruit, but without all the off flavors of the TB.  Mouthfeel: Rich, big, and supremely boozy  Drinkability: 1 and done...I mean, I'm loving this one, but it's powerful enough that any more would just be excessive  Conclusion: This was damn good; I'm glad I got to try it. Just another example of DFH pushing the envelope and another one of their successes. I really wish I'd bought two (this was from a mix-a-six) so I could see what a couple more years in the cellar would do to this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Some maple syrup, caramel and dark fruits. There is a little bit of heat to the nose but not a whole lot.  Taste is similar to the nose, very sweet with lots of wood flavor and rich dark fruits. Some raisins, plums a little chocolate but the wood really steals the show here. Very strong wood flavor that I think would mellow beautifully with some more age on it.

10099,33832,mikel52588,3.38,"Bottled: 2/17/09  Appearance: Pours a nearly black beer with about a half fingerlength head that retains similar to pepsi, and has a full lacing that disappears after a little while  Smell: Alcohol is a bit pungent, its hard to distinguish any other flavors in there.  Taste: Still lots of alcohol as the aroma suggests; I'm getting a soft coffee-like taste, caramel malt, and Glazed almonds all in the back, some in the aftertaste as well.  Mouthfeel: Its kind of slick on your tongue because of the alcohol I would presume and sort of makes your tongue feel light; while at the same time it is heavy beer, don't drink this one too fast. Carbonation is light when maybe they should have added more. And aftertaste isn't too bad.  Drinkability: This one is a sipper. Goes down like dark rum, and sometimes it makes me cringe a little. The flavors are faint compared to the thick body and slightly overbearing alcohol presence.

10099,33832,craftaholic,3.48,"Appearance: This is one hell of a dark brew. Has an extremely black opaque hue with hints of red in the light. The head is a dark tan that starts off at a finger length and fizzles away to a tight knit ring with a little bit of retention. Bottled on 2/17/09  Smell: The nose is a very pungent ethanol that really stings and then soothes with a nice woody malt from the palo santo. Other discernable scents floating in the sea of alcohol are hints of vanilla, tart apples and figs.  Taste: Upfront you know you're in for a thick brew. There are some prominent earthy flavors with a lot of woody dryness. It has some smokiness to it and has nice luscious sweet and bitter dark and 'hershey kiss'-like chocolate backbone. There are also nuances of caramel, vanilla beans, as well as fruity nuances of figs and candied cherries. There is even some nuttiness like sugared pecans and cashews and finishes with a tinge of spice that leads it to a similarity to rum.  Mouthfeel: It is a vicious full bodied brew and feels more like a stout or porter than a brown ale. Has almost a cream soda quality with the carbonation mixing with its syrupy thickness. The finish is extremely long and almost leaves fumes on your breath from the alcohol content.  Drinkability: The abv is on par with its aroma and taste and leaves you with a warming sensation. Worth a shot but sessioner beware: You'll want to sip or it'll sneak up on you with its 'big boy pants' abv.  Overall: This is a very boozy brew but not in the 'hot' sense but rather in its warming effects. I really like the woody notes in this but it might be overkill considering all the complexities it has regardless. Would be curious to see how this would fair without the added woodiness from the vessels.

Smells of earthy wood, fig, and vanilla bean. The taste reveals a smoky, malty body that is perfectly balanced between sweet and earthy and malty. The alcohol is present, but conveyed in a soft and supple way.  The finish is a bit sweet and a bit tart, but carries the fig, chicory wood, and mushroom smokiness with it to the end.

Initial large, brown and foaming head that melts quickly leaving a thin but reliable ring and minimal lacing.  S - Vanilla and an exotic caramel range over a roasted malty backbone.  T - Sweet and malty around a warming alcohol feeling that is well hidden within the complex wooded flavors . But this is an entirely different aged wood sweetness, very rich, vanilla laden with complex caramel tones, a present but a bit shy bitterness, and a deep and very enjoyable experience to the palate.  M - A bit of carbonation, very nicely balanced, on a brew that gears very close to a full body.  D - Appreciating the kind of achieved brew and enjoying it every time. It goes down very well. This can also be a great sipper.  Notes: They can call it brown if they chose to do so, and I understand style wise why this is not a stout, but this is a dark brew.

10099,33832,CHickman,4.54,"Pours black in color with ½ inch thick creamy chocolate milk brown head; smells roasted malt and cedar or burnt wood, with a slight sweet ending.  Tastes roasted and rich, with a nice complex combo of malt, coffee, molasses, vanilla, sugar, burnt wood and then a sweet dry finish that brings out the coffee, vanilla, and maybe even hints of chocolate and some fruit. It warms you up as you drink it and it gets better the longer it sits. Considering the different ingredients mixed in the brew I thought that it would have more spice and kick to it, but I'm pleasantly surprised by how nice and easy this beer is to drink and savor.  Little to no carbonation to this brew, and yet it still seems to go down smooth even though the strong alcohol content (12% ABV) is obvious and the beer is heavy with a lot of body. The burnt malt and smoky wood flavors repress the alcohol taste and make this like a nice stout, almost leaning towards a port wine experience. This is definitely a tasty beer meant for sipping and savoring and I highly recommend it as it's quite unique. An outstanding beer!  1/17/2016: Opened a 2009 bottle that I bought at the brewery in the summer of 2009; it poured pitch black color with a thick creamy/foamy 2 finger head that dissipated slowly and left great foamy lacing. Nose is full of roasted malt, char, burnt coffee, vanilla, molasses, brown sugar, booze like dark rum or bourbon and some earthy or woody notes. It reminds me of a bourbon barrel aged beer and gives off the same kind of complexities. Flavor has all of the same aspects as the nose but with more caramel and vanilla, and then cocoa powder, dark chocolate, peat moss, cherry, port wine and strong candied sugar which almost seems like chocolate dipped gummy bears. The Palo Santo wood influence is so similar to oaky bourbon barrels that I can see why DFH uses these vessels. No alcohol burn, it mellowed since my last review and this beer improved as it seems to have aged very well. I pushed the ""Overall"" score up from 4 to 4.5 based on this bottle and I will purchase more of this fine elixir.

Aroma is strangely exotic and unique with black licorice spicyness, tangy prune, raisin, molasses, and vanilla, cooked brown sugar, and cardamom. Very reminiscent of a pruneyish Port wine, Anchor OSA, and Expedition stout.  Taste is even stranger and unique, but in a good way. A very good way! All about mirroring a port with deep, dark, tangy heat with alluring, deep seeded spices of anise, cardomom, and molasses. Quite lusterious and full of warming sensations behind its depth of dark brooding tang. The flavors are similar to some of the bigger, chewier, Baltic Porters out there.  Bold body of smokey dark tones with a warming of an, almost reaching, Belgian chocolatey warmth on top of a strong medium body. Soft, smooth, and tenderly chewy in some portions of its mid range. Quiet, lofty finish with leftovers of dark fruity paste textures and darker candied spices coating the palate like a fruit filled pastry.  Outstandingly yummy stuff! A heavy sided dark, tangy, spiced brew that captures a unique essence. The warmth hits well and welcome and makes this a wonderful sipper and a dangerously easy drinker.

Mild bitterness segues into pleasing malt sweetness, typical of the style. Beneath the strong alcohol presence lie notes of roasted nuts, cherries, butterscotch and cacao. Finish very warming, with notes of red grapes and licorice.  Low carbonation and medium body, with a very smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel. The prickliness of the ridiculous 12% abv contrasted nicely.  Very tasty, however, unless your goal is getting tanked, I recommend enjoying sparingly. An 8-9% would be much more attractive to me.

I'm generally not a DFH fan but this is probably the best offering I've had from them.  Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied with fine carbonation.

Certainly not nearly as aromatic as when poured out of the bottle, still nice though. Flavor is deep and sweet. Complex and fresh. Earthy from the wood and such. The sweetness isn't as potent as from the bottle, it's a bit more smooth and rounded. Mouth is thick and quite viscous. quite nice. Very full-bodied. Drink is very fresh and crisp. Tasteful and good. Not too heavy. It seems a little smoother and noticeably fresher than from the bottle.

10099,33832,kgotcher,3.95,"Technically Brown ale only goes to about 6% ABV (BJCP Guidline) so I would call this a double brown for comparison sake. Hard to compare this to a classic like Samuel Smiths Brown.  Pours a very dark Stout black color. Frankly calling this brown is strange.  Aroma is big vanilla, sweet cherry, dark fruit, lemon, and many notes that are just beyond my pallete.  In the mouth it is lighter than expected, warming from the huge abv, but still light from a fairly high carbonation.  Taste is toasted malt, vanilla, caramel, apple? prune, woody, with a bitter grassy finish. Some of the flavors are very complex and surprising to get from a beer.  Overall not an overly drinkable beer yet an example of what is possible. A very creative beer that expands my own expectations of what beer is or should/could be. Even as a homebrewer I can barely appreciate what went into this beer.  Try it just for the experience.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

This doesn't pour like a brown ale at all, as its almost a midnight black, motor oil, with a mocha head and some lacing. It looks good, but not like a brown ale. Aroma of chocolate, nut and vanilla (presumably from the barrels). Thankfully it tastes like a brown, and a rather rich one at that. Chocolate, nut, toasted brown bread and caramel all headily combine. There's a fair bit of booze in the finish, and I find this detracts, although it doesn't seem as high alcohol at the 12% ABV suggests. Fairly viscous body with moderate carbonation.

Very nice aroma. There is an overall richness, with some aromas poking out. I get whiffs of vanilla, chocolate, anise, some alcohol, chocolate, as well as a mix of fruits that is difficult to distinguish individual notes. The taste is a definite ""Oh Wow!"". The flavor is very rich, with some roastiness on top. A faint sweetness, and a huge collaboration of flavors, with a hint of bitterness at the end. Dark fruits, vanilla, chocolate, a woodiness amongst many others. Very Nice!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

A thin ring of espresso film around the edge with a pool of fine bubbles in the center. Aroma-Some toffe, black licorice, a faint sweet caramel essence-nothing strongly present. Mouthfeel-Medium bitterness gives way to a very rich malty flavor. Initially sweet like a milk stout but the heat from the alcohol creeps in and warms the palate-in a good way. A froth on the palate intensifies the sweetness and much of the same flavors. The wood aging has given this brown ale a very mild edge. There is a lingering bitterness that is somewhat woody.

Taste: A deep, dark, roasted malt flavor is sweet and bitter. It gives way to the main flavors of licorice, vanilla, liquor, fig and leather. Wood then comes through with vigor. The finish is boozy and dry.  Mouthfeel: Pretty full and strong with viscosity, wood, booze and flavor. There is so much going on, that nothing is cloying, despite the intensity.

A= Much like the bottled version, this ale poured a very dark black/brown (dark like a Russian Imperial Stout) with zero light penetration. The head rose just 1/2"" and settled quickly to a broken skim.  S= Smelled of dark malts, roasted grains, faint raisins, chickory, vanilla, and a faint woody/oaky scent. Lots of boozy alcohol present too.  T= Very similar to what the aromas lead you to expect. Started with the sweet malt / bitter roasted grain combo. The middle showed mild chocolate, dark ripe fruits, and vanilla. The barrel character came in halfway helped to dry the finish considerably. Long deliciously boozy finish and aftertaste.  MF= Full bodied with a fairly sharp crispness to the carbonation. Despite that, this still manages to coat your tongue with its fullness.  D= I liked this beer a lot, and I may even like it better on tap than from the bottle.

Tastes of warm butter bread, vanilla ice cream, chocolate, dried fruit, roasted malts, tart cherries.  This beer has some very complex flavors, compacted by a wonderfully dense aroma. The alcohol is warming, but not overpowering. Clocking in at 12 percent, this is surprisingly drinkable...which could be quite dangerous.

Thick rich chocolaty malt, with some well blended vanilla presence. I get a powerful alcohol warmth mixed in with the bitter chocolate that is followed by that same fresh cut log essence I got in the smell. The woody flavors are really working overtime to mellow out the strong alcohol warmth. Wow.  The mouthfeel is thick and reminiscent of skim milk.

After having success with several other DFH brews (90 Min, Indian Brown), I was jacked for this original take on a Brown Ale.  A: Reminiscent of an RIS (though a tone or two ligher as ruby shines through). Mocha colored head that fades quickly and leaves dashes of lace around the glass.  S: Complex aromas include dark fruit, molasses and chocolate and of course, a heavy dose of smokey wood esters  T: Opens with a spicey malt and caramel flavor that moves in a dark fruit and smokey, woody direction by mid-palate. Finishes with a nice sweet, bitter flavor and the smokey wood flavor sticks around as a nice after-taste.  M: Full bodied with moderate carbonation  D: Another winner from DFH, this is a truly original and incredible Ale (mucho credit to the brewers). This is on part with Indian Brown Ale and is a must try for all true beer fans. The best part is that this is not just some unique jumbled mess that you have hold your nose to finish but a fantastic brew that I truly enjoyed.

The head was about a finger width and dissipated into a frothy ring around the edge of the beer leaving a slight lacing down the glass. Very nice looking beer.  The smell is boozy with hints of ripe fruit, roasted malt, coffee and a hint of vanilla (I had a hard time placing the vanilla until I read the bottle; now its more pronounced)  The taste is wonderfully complex with a smooth malt character that coats the palate. The flavor is a combination of dark ripe fruit, a hint of dark cocoa or coffee and just the right amount of the wood flavor. Unlike most wood aged beers, this one really compliments the beer and adds depth to the character, not just a bark flavor.The alcohol comes through with a warming sensation (as one would expect at 12% abv). Very tasty.  This is a great beer, it coats the palate with a great depth of flavor that is pretty strong for a brown ale.

Vigorous pour doesn't produce much head, but what is there is a dark, sandy color. Light lacing kisses the sides of the glass.  S: Warm, melted chocolate, raisins, and vanilla notes dominate the nose. A boozy alcohol picks up near the end, especially once the glass warms.  T: Nutty and buttery diacetyl as I would expect from a brown ale. The vanilla, dark fruits (rum-soaked raisins), and chocolate notes are an added plus and give a nice, complex twist to this style. Earthy wood notes dry out as the drink transitions into the finish. Malts really pick up in the finish with a warm, toasted bread flavor that moderate any initial sweetness from the vanilla notes.  M: Smooth and creamy for a brown ale. Pretty impressed with this one.  D: Pretty damn awesome. This is a brown ale? It tastes more like what you would expect from a barrel-aged beer.

Large aroma of overripe fruit and sweet caramel. The flavor is unique: 'brown ale' does not encompass this. It's warming, with a woodiness that doesn't make itself apparent in the nose, though you don't taste the alcohol all that much; bitterness is very high but hop flavor is slight at best. Malt is lightly roasted but never head. There's a pleasant acidity as well, which lightens things. The body is light for the strength but it doesn't feel or taste like it's been done with adjuncts.

Good small bubbled head, thick and dense, looks like a malt-shake.  Alcohol on the nose. Nail polish remover and magic marker come to mind. Caramel, vanilla and chocolate are in the background. This is strong abv and no hiding it.  Taste is better at hiding the alcohol.

Some woody notes. Maybe some dark chocolate and bread. Now I get a hint of some dark dried fruit, although it's subtle enough that I almost didn't notice it. Tasty.  M - Very thick and heavy, almost like an Impy Stout, although not quite. Stays with you for a while, like a milkshake. Not overly carbonated, pretty silky and smooth.  D - Definitely on the low side. 12% does the job. I usually get sleepy toward the end of the first, and if for some reason I open a second I'm ready to take a break about halfway through.

Smell: Unsurprisingly, this beer has a sweet, malty aroma. Very appealing for someone who's into big malty beers (dopplebocks, etc.).  Taste: Big beer... though perhaps not as complicated as I'd originally hoped for. First malty, then sweet, then some strange combination of salt and alcohol. This aftertaste actually gets a bit in the way of my enjoyment of this one.  Mouthfeel: This syrupy brew coats the throat on the way down. Sorta reminds me of cough syrup - in a good way!

Its as dark brown as brown can be. Most people would probably call it black. Very tiny amounts of light make it through around the edges. Thin tan head that leaves a little streaky lacing.  Smell: Surprisingly, it does smell somewhat like brown ale. It smells sweet and very malty. It has some slightly bitter coffee or chocolate notes. Theres also something a little oaky which I guess is the palo santo wood.  Taste: The taste is not unexpected after smelling it. Very malty and a little sweet. There's surprising bitterness, and the finish is like bittersweet chocolate. For something so big, its very balanced. I can detect almost no alcohol until my stomach starts to burn. Impressive.  Mouthfeel: The fullest brown ale ever. So thick and malty, a little syrupy. There's some tingly carbonation that keeps it from being overly syrupy.  Drinkability: This stuff is scary.

Smell is very subtle for such a high alcohol beer. Mostly some soft dry wood and some touches of malt.  Taste was very thick with a immediate big malt taste. Very woody, with an almost dry chicory taste. Rich brown, dark bread, a strong burnt and/or granite rock sort of darkness. There's a strong burnt malt bitterness more than any defined hop taste. Hops in general are kept to a minimum without any distinctive flavors. This is a brown malt monster. I know it's aged on wood, but it's actually very subtle when it comes to the wood. I touch of dryness and that's about it. Ends with a dark lingering bitterness.  An interesting beer, an imperial brown ale. Definitely gets better as it warms. The alcohol starts to hit a bit harder.

It's porter thick, a dark brown, almost black, that gives the same idea. The head is beige.  I'm not getting a lot from the nose. A mild cinnamon, the cliche oak and what might be a sharp coffee.  The first thing that hits me is a vanilla that's mixed alcohol that's almost piercing. It's hard to tell the difference between the back and front. Behind that there's fruit, which opens toward the middle. Then, there's the distinct carmel overtones. Roasted malts, but still the alcohol can be overbearing.  This is porter heavy, almost an RIS. I need stronger carbonation for a brown, not to mention nut flavors. Were this a porter, it's overburdened.  This is pretty far from drinkable. The sharpness does help. The alcohol is a beating, not to mention covering and sometimes down right searing. I can't do better than sipping, which is nice if it's due to complexity, but that's not the case.

It came with a sugar brown head, and pretty frothy as well. Just amazing in terms of consistency.  The smell was different. It smelled like a metallic oak stump. There are something with some brown ales that have a sort of metallic smell and taste.  The taste was okay but nothing i would revisit. It had the wood barrel taste, but just not in a way that I enjoyed. It was a bit bitter, not very smooth and the brown ale would of been more enjoyable it they conditioned it in bourbon barrels? Just not my type of brew.  J  edit: Just figured out that the metallic taste that I was referring to was the extremely high 12% ABV. It is not covered very well and distracts from the other tastes the brown ale offers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

It has a very strong smell of wood, dark cherries, smoke, and oak.  This is very smooth tasting heavy beer, can't believe its 12%. There is slight taste of chocolate, notes of smoke and wood. Incredibly drinkable for its alcohol content.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,theghost3,4.15,"200th review, and great choice if I may say.  Pours a midnight black with a 1/2 finger cafe au lait head. The head stays pretty much throughout, decent lacing.  Smell is mainly coffee, dark fruits, caramel, and vanilla. The taste is actually more complex than the smell. There are obvious woody flavors that are reminicent of red wine or bourbon. There's brown sugar, caramel malts, and vanilla. Mouthfeel is a little more acidic than I like, thick.  This is a drinkable brew; it's an American Brown on steroids. It reminds me of a sort of stout/belgian dark/brown combination. Watch out for that 12 percent ABV because it'll sneak up on you. Looking forward to the next 200.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,KenC411,3.93,"Appearance: Pours a thick coffee color with a small head that disappears rapidly. Opaque. Forms no so much a lace, but more of a lacor on the side of the glass.  Smell: Initially, alcohol. After warming to room temperature, smells of coffee, raisins, nuts, and a hint of vanilla.  Taste: Coffee, nuts, and raisins. Burn of alcohol, decreasing the drinkability.  Mouthfeel: Smooth like an oatmeal stout, but thicker.  Drinkability:Too alcoholic for my taste. It has all of the workings of a strong beer: complexity, smoothness, and fragrance. The alcoholic bite really ruins it for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Great lacing as this goes down.  S: Raisins, coffee, vanilla, and toffee aromas come out to show malt complexity. Roasted malt has a hint of aged wood also.  T: Robust roasted malt with a slight peat smokiness. Black currants, vanilla, coffee with cream, caramel all play around the tongue. Bourbon flavors jump in a bit at the end. Hops there just to bitter a bit for balance.  M: Full body and creamy with some alcohol warmth very apparent near the finish.

10099,33832,cdpike,4.2,"Bottle Poured into imperial pint.  Pours syrupy thick and wonderful. VERY dark for a brown ale, I would say it was a stout if I didn't see the label. About ¼ inch of foam that dissipates quickly. Nose is strongly of vanilla, alcohol, and chewy malts. Reminds me of bourbon stouts, etc. There also seems to be something spicy/Belgian smelling in there. Heavy bodied feel with initially sweet taste, caramel comes out quite strongly. Second taste brings out the Brazilian wood. Wow. Nice complexity with a bit of single barrel bourbon coming through. Mouth feel is much more like an imperial stout than a brown ale, but I wouldn't expect anything else from Sam and the guys at Dogfish Head. Finishes much sweeter than I anticipated with a strong taste of wood, vanilla and nice, roasted nutty caramel goodness.

10099,33832,OldSchoolGamer,3.78,"Another Dogfish Head brew. I have had this one before, but it has been a while. Not the biggest Brown Ale fan, though. Here is my review:  A: Pours a pitch black color. Dark tan head that leaves light lacing with each sip. Head does dissipate rather quickly though. Looks like a stout.  S: The smell is not overpowering. The wood character is very prominent, as is the alcohol. A touch of coffee, but not much. Some dark fruit in there as well.  T: The taste is there in full force. Lots of good flavors going on here. I get a lot of dark fruit like cherry and plum. There is also a light coffee, smoke, and chocolate presence, but not nearly as much as in a stout of this calibur. The wood and alcohol are intertwined in the flavor throughout. The alcohol is a bit much at times, but it remains enjoyable. Very good.  M: Medium to heavy bodied. Somewhat creamy. Not as thick as a stout, but very close.  D: This beer is 12% ABV, so that is nothing to fool around with. One at a time. But drinks very well and tastes good. I could probably drink more than one, but might be feeling it in the morning.  Probably one of the best Dogfish Head brews available. Since they don't have a traditional Imperial Stout in their lineup, this is the closest thing to it. This isn't a beer I would buy every week, but it is enjoyable every time I have it. Recommended and worth the cash.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Adamdc,3.9,"Poured into tulip. No date on bottle but I've been cellaring this for at least 8 months.  A: basically opaque with very faint ruby hues when held up to light. Topped by tan 1/2 inch head that dissipates to a minimal head that leaves moderate lacing  S: roasted malts with brown sugar, molasses and some chocolate. Picking up some alcohol along with the woodiness. Nice aroma.  T: Very nice blend of bitter chocolate, molasses, alcohol and the flavor from the wood barrels  M: I'd have to say medium. Just the right amount of carbonation  D: I'd say drinkability is moderate. It goes down very smoothly but the alcohol is a big part of the flavor and the higher ABV gets to you quickly  DFH are cornering the market on 'different' brown ales with this one and India Brown Ale.

10099,33832,IronDjinn,4.47,"Short, tight creamy tan head capping a deep, dense opaque black appearing body.  Rich caramel, chocolate and coffee notes on the nose, figs and dates, a bit of blackstrap molasses and black licorice, some boozy whiskey. Some nut and faint vanilla as it nears room temperature.  Whoa Nelly, this stuff is bold and robust, and as over-the-top as it seems at first, there is definite method behind the madness, a more complex flavour profile beyond a high octane velvet-gloved bitch slap. Starts out with straight intense sweet yet dry malt, dark dry fruit and wafer in the middle, finishes with some dry nut and wood, plus some alcohol warmth. Dry dark cocoa and alcohol warmth lingers in the aftertaste, while wood and nut lingers on even longer. Resiny vanilla coats the lips.  Mouthfeel is full, yet not too thick, velvety smooth with only a minimal stickiness across the palate, very impressive for the abv%.  A brown ale that's been fed a whole lotta protein shakes and has gone through gladiator school, and comes out in the end larger than life yet refined, they must have snuck in some debutante lessons as well. Classify it as a strong dark ale or even a barleywine, I'm convinced. A Dogfish Head experiment worthy of the effort, and definitely worth the cost of the wood vats, definitely a worthwhile investment.

Alcohol makes a strong play here too. A little too much alcohol for my taste.  T- Complex. Slightly phenolic for my taste, but definitely a rich blend of chocolate, rich sweet malt, molasses, spicy alcohol, slight vanilla, and a rich woody finish. As I drink it, it really grows on me. There's a lot here, and I really like it. This is the first high ABV DFH beer I've had that actually succeeds in being a good beer (I've had the 120 and Raison D'extra, but not WWS yet).

The aroma is of perfumey wood, caramel, toffee, and more perfume. This is a very appealing aroma, and I can't really see how it could possibly be made better. The taste is a little maltier than the aroma, but there is still a large and pleasing perfume presence. There is a significant alcohol presence in both the taste and aftertaste. The finish is all wood, and perfume. Again, like the aroma this I can't find anything here to improve upon. The mouthfeel is full bodied with light carbonation fitting this style, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a great beer. It is utterly and completely unique. Not only is it an extreme beer in that it is twice the strength as other brown ales, it is an extreme beer in that it is aged in Palo Santo wood. I think the later is what makes this beer so enjoyable. I would love to sip away at this on a frequent basis.

Definitely alcohol smell in this beer. There is even some chocolate to this.  Taste: This is definitely the most exotic beer I have ever had and I love it. The taste is similar to the smell, but has an almost biting bitter flavor that I just didn't expect, which was enjoyable. There is some fruit flavor with maybe a little coffee flavor in here. I typically don't enjoy beers with a strong alcohol presents, but this has blown me away. It is almost as if there are some spices in this beer.  Mouthfeel: Is a slight bit cream and definitely has an alcoholic after taste. This is a pretty heavy body and definitely chewy. It is a meal in a bear and man do I like it.

A nice bready yeast component. Even a small cherry hint.  (T)- Freakin rich and sweet roasted malts with chocolate covered cherries! Bready on the finish. A cola essence like Dr. Pepper.  (M)- Its so thick, you could put this on pancakes if you really wanted to perhaps! Its sweet, rich, and has just the tiniest bitterness from the roasted malts.

After a few sips, I felt a sort of numbing, alcohol effect in my mouth. The taste seems to change with almost every sip. As it warms, the malt comes out, and almost takes over.

A bakers chocolate component.  The taste is good. There are heavy notes of caramel malts with a bourbon, oaky taste, which I'm guessing is the wood. Some chocolate notes, milk and dark chocolate.  The mouthfeel highlights the flavor nicely as there is not too much carbonation to overwhelm the flavor, yet enough that you notice. A very nice dryness is present at the finish. It initially presents very thick and creamy but lightens towards the finish and leaves a stickiness on the lips. It is full bodied.  Overall, this is a fairly drinkable beer.

Firstly a roasty mollasses aroma with a hint of coffee and dark fruits hits your nose. In the background for some reason I get a smell of cherries, though in the background still strong. The taste it's self is very interesting for a brown ale. The brew has that ale taste to it with the dark fruits but the mollasses and others make this brew more of a stout imo. The consistancy is pretty thick also for a brown ale.

The head isn't a big rolling-over-the top affair, but then again this brew was poured for me at Kelleher's in Peoria, so who knows what it would look like if given my usually ""just dump it in the glass"" treatment. Lacing is abundant and beautiful. Sappy dewdrop lace shimmers down the glass and leaves sticky residual sugars behind. Looks ominously good.  S - Oh shit. This is crazy. This is like a tawny port. Hints of charcoal, oak, black currant, and loads of cashews, almonds, walnuts, and what almost reminds me of grapes... big fat blue grapes with seeds.  T - Deep wood and earth tones support ""higher"" notes of boozy port, maraschino cherry, almonds, and grapes. Wow. The alcohol is actually very detectable in this brew, but that only enhances its late evening mystery in my opinion.  M - Rich, thick, velvety, lush, and yet woody, earthy, hearty, and raw. This is the beer that I would imagine Tom Bombadil enjoying by a roaring fire. A refined woodsman's brew.

Caramel colored cap, about half an inch thick or so, and sticking around quite nicely. Not a whole lot moving through the beer, but still a couple of bubbles on the edges. Excellent clingy sticky lacing. Nice looking beer.  S: Brown sugar, fresh cut lumber, roasted malts, vanilla/bourbon as well. Fair amount of booze, I figured that would have toned down, but it is still really present. Not that it is out of place at 12%.  T: A lot more smoky than I remembered, huge woody/charred taste, brown sugar sweetness, and a slightly astringent alcohol kick as well. The Palo Santo wood adds an interesting depth of character, and in some ways really accents the overall boozyness of the beer. Lots of different layers in here, but man I'm picking up a huge bourbon note. I like this a lot more now than when I tried it initially. Doesn't have that common DFH cantaloupe alcohol flavor, which is nice.  M: Medium thickness, with almost no carbonation, very smooth, ridiculously dry as well, both from the wood, and the booze. Fair amount of alcohol heat as well. Pretty hot beer. But it isn't out of place for a high alcohol, wood aged beer. Quite nice really.  D: Eh...this one is tricky, a little too complex, and entirely too boozey to drink a lot of. Good beer, but it's a sipper, and a pleasure at that, but not something to drink more than one of.

Poured a pitch black color that poured into the glass in a very viscous fashion. Holding it up to the light doesn't make the color seem lighter by even the slightest measurement. Big, mocha colored head that lasted longer than I thought it would considering the high abv percentage. Glorious looking beer.  Caramel, brown sugar, vanilla and booze in the nose. As it warms up, other scents become noticeable, with elements of soy sauce, dark chocolate and, just barely, spicy hops. Smells like a sweet, rich stout.  Taste is much like the smell. Brown sugar hits the tastebuds, followed shortly afterwards by a taste not unlike chocolate covered cherries. There's a bitter, coffee-like taste in the background, along with some mild yet spicy hops and a warming alcohol sensation. Tastes sweet, strong and rich.  I thought this would be a heavy-bodied beer, and was wrong. It's thoroughly medium bodied, but with a sticky, coating mouthfeel. I suppose that's about right for what seems like a brown ale on steroids.  This would make a great nightcap or dessert beer. Not much of a session beer. In fact I'm rather glad it's sold in a 12oz bottle rather than a bomber. That would be too much of a good thing. The last few new DFH beers I've tried have seemed a bit gimicky.

S: Malty, woody, boozy, smoky, vanilla! tremendous nose T: Heavy wood flavors with notes of vanilla, coffee, caramel. M: Very smooth with the alcohol present on the nose not really all that present on the mouthfeel D: I would drink this again for certain, but would probably take it easy.

10099,33832,beer2day,4.53,"Pours a very dark indigo with a gorgeous thin finger of tan head. Retains that thin layer and laces extremely well.  Nose is cherries, dark malt, bitter fruit, slight anise, and a hint of cream.  Hits slightly sweet, but that quickly changes to a robust roast malt flavor. Absurdly good. Tart sweetness as if from cherries is still there, but the roast flavor takes over. A slight creaminess to the finish tops it off. A very warming beer. Hides the 12%, so watch out.  The best beer DFH has made.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Gehrig,4.35,"My friend Frank raved about Palo Santo Marron before we vacationed together, saying he would bring some down for us to enjoy some of this unique, finely crafted beverage together. Outstanding call by The Sage, for this is excellent, one of the most unique beers I've ever tried.  A modest tan head rests atop a deep, dark brown body, with moderate lacing on the Ommegang glass. Not much duration to the head, but that doesn't detract much. The smells are good but a little understated, with lots of molasses, caramel, coffee, and some berry peeking through.  What a taste! Unlike oak-aged beers, especially those in whiskey casks, this has a casky taste, but...dare I say...more restrained. I love the bold oak-aged flavors in those beers, so that's less a pejorative toward those and more of a way to describe PSM. The molasses and wood flavors emerge sticky but restrained, permeating the beer but allowing plenty of room for other aspects, especially caramel and coffee, to play prominent if complementary roles. Terrific and smooth.  For being 12%, I expected this to be more of a sipper, but it isn't. PSM is worth sipping or enjoying with restraint to allow it to warm slightly, and to bask in its rich complexity, but it's not hit-one-over-the-head strong. One of my favorites from DFH without question, Palo Santo Marron is well worth the try and will no doubt age well.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,anchordrinker,4.13,"A- Pours purely black, and lets no light through when held to the light. The head is one-finger's worth and tan in color.  S- I get aromas of brown sugar, molasses, sweet raisins, and some booziness.  T- Smokey, earthy, woody, and sweet flavors dominate. I get molasses, just as in the nose, as well as some vanilla-y flavors.  M- A pretty heavy body, which is a bit syrupy, and has pretty low carbonation.  D- Definitely a sipper, though it does hide the alcohol pretty well considering the 12% ABV. That being said, I wouldn't want more than one in a night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,berkey,4.33,"Pours a medium brown head with reddish tones and a viscous jet black body. This has to be the least brown 'brown ale' I've ever seen. Decent head retention and average lacing.  Initial aromas are quite sweet and include vanilla, toffee, and cherry. Wood is detectable but not as much as one might expect.  Palate brings on more vanilla and toffee sweetness but not nearly as much as the nose leads one to expect. While there's a good share of wood notes here it's not woody in the oaky, barky, way I often mean when I describe a beer that way. Wood seems to be there primarily as a mellowing agent and for some aromatics. While alcohol sweetness is there throughout, the wood actually does a very good job taking the edge off any direct booze flavors. Gets a little roasty and slightly fruity as it warms.  This one has lethal drinkability, the first few times I had this it was on tap and I threw several of these back before reminding myself of the ABV and slowing down.  Another incredibly ambitious beer from DFH. Possibly my favorite of theirs so far.

10099,33832,Gosox8787,4.13,"My friend and I had on tap at the Barley Pub in Dover, NH. They had a great selection of beers there, especially considering how poor of a selection most places in the area have. We both decided to try this, as neither of us had had it.  The beer was poured on tap into a nice tulip glass. There was a one finger brown head. The beer was dark brown to black. The nose was roasted malts, bourbon, raisin, and licorice. The ABV is noticable in the nose. The taste hits upfront with nice roasted malt and moves into sweetness from the dark fruit and the bourbon. After a while, the flavor shifted more toward the sweeter flavors. The mouthfeel was thick and syrupy without much carbonation. Drinkability was moderate due to the high ABV. The flavor wouldn't ever wear thin with me though.  Overall, a great beer and definitely my favorite selection from DFH. I don't know if I would call this a brown ale, but certainly a great, complex beer. Extremely enjoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Hornet2003,3.53,"Appearance: Pours a motor oil amber-brown...Almost black. No head retention.  Smell: I smell anise. It smells basically like Jaegermeister. Licorice and cola aromas.  Taste: Sweet. Alcohol, ginger, cola, molasses and honey. Very complex.  Mouthfeel: Thick! Such a ""chewy"" brew. The carbonation is excellent and overall, it dances on the tongue.  Drinkability: If this is trying to be an American Brown Ale then I would say I could only drink one at a time...This is sub-par for a brown ale. Reclassify it as an American Strong Ale and I would rate it much higher. But this is ridiculous.  Overall: I have had this twice now and boy does it hit hard. Over the top alcohol content means it drinks very harsh.

10099,33832,jbertsch,3.77,"Poured into a tulip glass. It was a very dark brown sporting sunburst-colored edges once the head dissipated. Head was chestnut and one-finger in size.  I smell smokey malts on top of chocolate undertones. An aroma of fig is also found, but buried way down underneath the malt.  On the palate, you first taste the smokey malt, then a flavor of dark chocolate blankets the tongue and stays a while, which is then joined by a taste of alcohol (hard to avoid that at 12%abv). It finishes long and smooth with the final notes tasting nutty and woodsy.  Mouthfeel is thick and very smooth with very little carbonation.  Drinkability - hmmm, you can't easily drink more than one. And because I was trying to really figure out exactly what I was tasting, I was sipping it frequently, which quickly made me buzzed.

Smooth, creamy and medium-bodied with a great balance of chocolate and caramel malts, along with toffee, toasted, and some buttery notes. Slightly sticky but not syrupy, has a mild fruit taste from hops and figs to round out the beer. The 12% ABV is well-hidden and makes this a dangerous sipper.

Plenty of wood in the aroma along with chocolate and some fruitiness. Wood jumps right out at you. Very peppery. Full bodied without being syrupy. Chocolate malt flavor that lingers long in the finish. A bit of alcohol, but that's not surprising for a 12% beer. There are some hops in there, but only enough to balance out the malt.  This was way to peppery for me to enjoy. I seem to have some real enhanced perception of peppery flavors, because the same thing keeps me from enjoying some Grenaches.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,caskstrength,4,"I'm schizophrenic on this one.  First time I was blown away. Brown ale? Really? I'm thinking Newcastle. I guess if you call it imperial brown...  But now that I've had a few, I think imperial brown ale is quite an accurate description. (emphasis on the imperial)  Dark pour, brown/white head. Smell is sweet, woody.  Taste is definitely unique. The woodiest beer I've had. Spicy, sharp, sweet. Boozy too. I've never eaten oak or maple or mahogany, but this is what I'd expect it to taste like. Full without being too thick, sweet without being syrupy. Complex is an overused but accurate descriptor. Wood aged imperial brown ale, indeed.  I don't know whether I like this beer or not. I have no idea if I'm going to buy it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

After tasting, I decided that this ale was well worth the money paid. Very complex brown ale. At 12% ABV it is kind of hard to hide the alcohol tastes, but I think that it is not an overpowering beer.  The mouthfeel is a good, ""full"" feel.  Could definitely only have one of these and still feel good after.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Taste and flavors are of pure chocolate with a very nice mouthfeel, almost like a cold melted chocolate in your mouth with nice texture, hints of carmel and vanilla flavors with a rich chocolate malty finish.

Also, there is a general smokiness to the scent. I felt that the sweetness seemed quelled by this woody hint. Generally, beers with an ABV this high are just too sweet for me. This was not the case here. Very rich and creamy mouthfeel.

10099,33832,superdedooperboy,4.2,"12 oz. brown bottle, bottled on 12/01/08, poured into a tulip glass.  Pours a mind-challenging deep, dark, virtually opaque brownish-black hue with a thick, creamy cap of cinnamon-brown foam that settles leisurely to a thick ring, leaving behind a few legs of lacing on the glass. Based on appearances alone, this one would suggest something along the lines of a Russian Imperial Stout as opposed to an American Brown, but then again, this is a Dogfish Head beer.  Until the brew warms up a little, aroma is difficult to detect. As the temperature rises, caramel and chocolate malt notes emerge, interlaced with notes of vanilla and an oaky, maple-like woodiness.  Wonderfully thick and viscous in mouthfeel, slick with a subtly prickly carbonation teasing the tongue. Deliciously dessert-like, with sweet chocolaty-caramel notes not dissimilar to those in the nose grabbing hold, wrapped up in nice vanilla and unique woody tannins contributed by the Palo Santo wood. The massive twelve percent alcohol content shows itself openly on the palate, with a building warmth and slight astringency that carries through all the way down, with the wonderful mix leaving behind a slight lingering sweetness from the mix of malt flavors along with a mildly dry bitterness.  Goes down remarkably easily for its strength and depth of flavor, but with the alcohol manifesting itself so early and leaving its mark behind on the head after its gone, this is a hefty brew to be certain, and certainly a one bottle, two max digestif or a perfect nightcap. Highly unique and worthy of world-class status, certainly worth seeking out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,augustgarage,3.93,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. This particular beer is 5 months old.  Liquid is an opaque seal brown with a thin, persistent, buff-colored ring of foam.  Aroma is sweet malt, spirit, caramel, unsweetened chocolate nibs, stale coffee. Other scents emerge as the liquid warms, they are strange, earthy, and not entirely dissimilar to those you might encounter in a moist crawl-space beneath an old house.  On the palate, the mustiness is diminished. Malt is strong, and while the hops take a back seat, they are definitely still in the car. Mild nuttiness balanced with a hint of citrus against a powerful wave of chocolate/coffee. Not particularly ""woody"" or presenting the flavors I normally associate with wood ageing. A very long, fairly dry finish dances back and forth between sweetness, astringency, and something that rides the line between truffle and ashtray.  Alcohol is warming and in concert with the carbonation is slightly stinging on the gums. It is fairly well disguised, but, really, I think the ABV is too high with this brew as it doesn't seem to contribute enough extra flavor to justify its presence. Medium-heavy mouthfeel but not especially slick or syrupy.  Difficult to rate for style as this seems more a descendent of porter or stout than amber or pale ale.  More than BBQ, I think this would stand up well to Cajun food (as suggested by the brewery).  Fairly agressive, but not as unique as I had hoped...  EDIT: After having this more frequently, I have to raise the drinkability a notch.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

I couldn't stop sticking my nose in the glass. The taste is what you would get if you mixed a dopplebock and a big brown ale. Bitter enough, but mostly malty sweet. Mouthfeel is excellent, 12% alcohol it is hidden well. I saved one for 3 months and the wood aroma/flavor dissapated slightly.

The taste is pretty fantastic. Everything I smelled is present in the taste, but the wood is much more forward than most of the other flavors. The alcohol content is betrayed more by the feeling I get in my face than by the taste. Extremely thick, very high apparent gravity. Paired with the alcohol content this makes it a sipper.  Out of my normal price range for an everyday drinker. It did nicely for getting me out of a mediocre beer funk.

Pours a viscous, very dark brown with a small, bubbly, tan head. Pretty good looking, but if I saw this sucker sitting in front of somebody I would ask what stout or porter they were drinking.  The smell on this beer is very enjoyable to me. Dark malts blend with a spicy phenolic character that gives way to a dark fruit characteristic. Also lurking is a kind of mesquite-burned characteristic.  This beer doesn't taste like a conventional brown ale. There is that smooth, nutty flavor up front, but the mouthfeel is so heavy that other flavors are imparted onto the palate. Following the sweet malt is a spicy alcoholic burn that pairs very well with the woody/smoky characteristics of this beer  One hell of a slump breaker, this beer reminds me what got me into craft beer in the first place...the beer.

10099,33832,JerzDevl2000,4.15,"Picked this up in Totowa recently. I've never had a bad beer from Dogfish Head and I didn't expect this to be any exception to that. Although this packed quite a punch, I enjoy it's taste and depth. This is not a Newcastle-type Brown Ale that goes right down but rather, this beer deserves to be savored slowly, since it's quite full and has a heavy mouthfeel!  The pour was dark, a bit foamy, but there wasn't any lace to be seen. What was lacking in appearance was more than made up for in the taste and mouthfeel. This is dark, foreboding, and heavy. Lots of oak, sugar, molasses, a bit of rum, a hint of chocolate and licorice, and of course, alcohol! I can't recall ever having a Brown Ale that was this strong and so full. This didn't have a strong warming effect or the stickiness and caramel of Newcastle or Brooklyn Brown. Rather, more of the flavor was in the back and the fullness of the beer pratically begs this to be put into a snifter and savored. Yes, it's that different!  Of course, any beer that 12% ABV is going to pack a wallop and this was no exception. The taste of the alcohol isn't strong, but the presence and mouthfeel of it was there after each sip went down. It didn't detract from the beer at all since everything is very well-crafted here. I'm not sure when this would be good for, as I tend to drink Brown Ales in the fall, but this has to be the best one available in this part of the country.

Almost like a chocolate covered cherry. Almost a hint of toffee, chocolate. Raisins. Certainly unique.  Taste - Sweet dark fruit. Chocolate covered raisins almost. A hint of booze. It's like a red wine with a full, full body. Not sure what this beast is. It's interesting. If you mixed old viscosity with some red wine, you might get this beer. Definitely some sweet malt.

There's nothing especially different or exotic about it, but that's fine by me.  The whole idea of a massively malty brown ale aged in monsterous wooden vats built out of Paraguayan wood is exactly what I would expect from Sam and the boys at Dogfish Head. That said, like the nose, I can't appreciate anything different or unique on the palate. Maybe something will come to the fore once the beer continues to warm.  None of that really matters, because good beer is good beer, no matter the backstory or the inspiration for its creation. Palo Santo Marron is good beer. Actually, it might end up convincing me that it's great beer by the time the twelfth ounce rolls around. It looks like DFH knows their browns, because Indian Brown is damn good stuff too.  The incredibly broad and deep flavor profile includes brown bread (not quite pumpernickel) covered with melted Hershey's kisses, melted caramels, candided cherries, sugared pecans and crushed vanilla beans. According to the label, the wood adds 'caramel and vanilla complexity'. Alright then.  Alcohol? Not a trace. The mouthfeel is superb, as any beer with this much malt is bound to be. However, it still takes talented brewers and perfectly dialed-in carbonation to put it all together.  I'm not sure what Palo Santo Marron (Marron is Portuguese for 'brown') tastes like fresh, but it's simply sublime after almost 15 months in the bottle. Without a doubt, this is one of Dogfish Head's best. If they keep brewing it, I'll keep buying it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,BierFan,3.92,"Poured from a 12 ounce brown bottle into a Duvel tulip. Bottled on date of 07/24/08.  Appearance: Very thin light brown head on top of a black body.  Smell: The smell is mostly of the palo santo wood. Some of the sweet darker malt aromas let themselves be known, caramel and toffee.  Taste: I'm surprised by how much wood flavor this beer still has even though it's just three months shy of a year. Definitely a robust and flavorful beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,ltjska04,4.28,"This beer was bottled in September of 2008, tasted in April 2009. It is very dark... both the look and smell remind me of an imperial stout, nowhere near a brown ale. But who cares? I'm loving it. The taste is delicious; lots of malt, some vanilla, syrup, and smoke. It's way tastier than any ordinary brown I've ever had and every sip reveals more nuances. The alcohol is noticeable but never gets in the way of the enjoyability of this brew. It's very smooth and leaves me wanting more.

M: A very full bodied beer with medium carbonation. Thick and syrupy.  O: This is a beer for the true beer geek only. The average Joe would pour this out. A very complex beer with alot to appreciate.

I have to tip my hat to the classy bottle design that even has a special ""wooden"" cap.  This is a rich black/brown beauty with cafe au lait head. Nose is vanilla bourbon, sweet malt, and kind of a unique sawdust/peat smell. Must be from the wood? Some vague Belgian qualities here.  Taste is a great sweet/spicy combo, like cumin and sugar daddies (if that makes sense). White raisins, deep sweet malts, vanilla/caramel liquors. Strong and complex. Nice.  Mouthfeel is quite good. Drinkability is the one weak point here, due to 12%ABV and the strong/sweet flavors. Overall, fantastic unique and original brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Gigantis,4.02,"bought a bottle of this that was bottled on 7-28-08. Would have liked to age it more, actually, but I was too tempted because I had a taste of this once at a party and I remembered it being really good. I wasn't disappointed.  I read on the label that this was a brown ale. This is not a brown ale on many levels. The first of which is the appearance. It is really dark with a light brown head. Not much lacing and the head retention is almost non-existent. I should have probably given this more of an aggressive pour into my snifter. It may not have been as light and fluffy as one expects from a ""brown ale"" but it still looked viscous and appetizing.  It smells like dark fruit and wood. the wood smell I refer to is smokey and lovely, really. Nothing much else going on here though.  Great taste. Very original. It has a very fig-like taste. Figs and dates... really connects the dots with its scent. It has some nice biscuity malt and alcohol presence with a light smoke taste that I can compare to a smoked porter. Try it. It's quite original.  It is oily and syrupy but not overtly. Some carbonation.... not much though. These are all things I enjoy to some extent. If you don't like a thicker beer, this is probably not for you. It sticks to you lips.... again, something i like.  Drinkability ... err, based on what I have said does this sound like the kind of beer you'd want to drink too many of? Thought not. Interestingly, I would oblige in three or four of these if I didn't care about the fact that I would be really entirely too drunk. really interesting, original beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,weasbri,4.17,"Dark, I mean really black, can't see through it. Thin head fades quickly and leaves no lacing behind. Rich aroma is the best way I can describe it. Trying to figure out what it is under the clear malt aroma that I can't quite place. Vanilla maybe? Could be a hint of the wood, if I knew what Palo Santo wood smelled like. I was really expecting the alcohol content to have more of an effect on the flavor and mouthfeel here, but it's managed to stay relatively subdued. I actually get a candy-like flavor in here, like toffee, but also a roasted taste of coffee, with some smokiness and slight bitterness (from the wood?). Not really drinkable beyond one at a time, but that's not what it was intended to be. I could definitely see this as an after-dinner drink to linger over.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,jgasparine,4.3,"A: Black with a beautiful coffee-colored lacy head that quickly dissipates.  S: Roasted and candy malt, dried fruit, slightly smoky, and an extremely faint astringency from the Palo Santo wood.  T: Extremely complex. Sweet candy sugar and molasses mingle with the smoky/spiciness of the Palo Santo wood. Dried dates and raisins mingle with some slight coffee notes in the background. After swallowing, all of these attributes are met with a very slight and non-offensive alcohol burn.  M: Exceptionally creamy, syrupy and slightly grainy. I can roll one sip of this beer around in my mouth for several minutes without losing any of that full-bodiness. The mouth is still pleasantly coated even after swallowing.  D: This is certainly a dessert beer. I personally enjoy having just one at the end of a meal. However, a number of my friends have reported continued enjoyment through a four-pack!

10099,33832,roscoehnj,3.92,"Smells unlike any other beer - must be the special wood aging but its hard to describe (for me). Beguiling to say the least.  Also enchanting on the taste buds. While I have never been adept at noting the particular tastes I can say that this is possibly the most complex beer I have ever had. Dark tastes, some bitter (but not hoppy - more of a roasted concept). Very smooth.  Can't drink more than one of these in a sitting.

Call it an Old Ale or a Strong Ale or a Barleywine, cuz this has nothing in common with your run-of-the-mill brown.  Pours brown-black, completely opaque with minimal head. It's a good thing they put ""malt beverage"" on the bottle, because this only vaguely resembles beer. Like their World Wide Stout, this is viscous, sweet and boozy like a port wine. Mixed in with the gobs of dark malt I detected a bit of the woody flavor that makes this brew special. Unfortunately I could not finish the glass because it was just too heavy for my palate.

Smelled of cocoa, roasted nuts, vanilla and possibly even a hint of sherry which gave it an alcohol tinge.  Extremely interesting and unique on the palette, unlike most brown ales or even beer. Flavors included cocoa, wood, sherry and even some spiciness towards the end.  A bit oily in the mouth for me, but was extremely smooth and lacked much carbonation, surprising paired well with some spicy Mexican food I was eating.

I can't pick up any whiffs of this special wood yet.  T- The beer grows on me, maybe it's the booze, perhaps it's warming up nicely. Anyways The booze is a major part of the taste, more than I would like. But not too overpowering like the WW stout. But I generally don't care for the strong alcohol flavor in my beers and I wasn't fully prepared for this one. But in the taste there is a bit of chocolate, more like burnt coco.

D- OK, but fairly tough for me to quantify. 12% ABV clearly makes this a one and done sipper in my book, but it does go down fairly smoothly considering. The wood flavors seem to build as consumed, which detracts from the overall drinkability for me.  Future outlook: American Brown Ale? I'd swear I was drinking a big barrel aged RIS if this were put blindly in front of me. Is there such a thing as an ""imperial brown ale,"" because if so, this is it.

The taste is incredibly complex and layered. At first it has a nice dark roasted nutty flavor. Right after that there are some wonderful vanilla flavors that are imparted from the wood. There are also some nice carmel notes that finish the beer off. And on top of all of that a very subtle alcohol flavor that doesn't negatively affect the flavor of the beer.

S--There is a pronounced boozy smell that overshadows the rich layers underneath. Slightly too much, kind of like a fresh Bourbon County Stout but not as strong. Vanilla, wood, and roasted malt peek through.  T--The wood taste comes through HUGE. It didn't taste as boozy as the smell would have suggested, which is a plus for my palette. Bourbon, vanilla, malt, maybe some caramel but all fairly well balanced other than the wood. This tastes good but I have a feeling I would like it more with at least a year of age on it.

Before drinking, I advise reading about it's making because this adds a whole layer of depth to the experience. Check this article out: http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/11/24/081124fa_fact_bilger?currentPage=all  A: Poured into a snifter, it is a viscous dark chocolate color. It delivered a small espresso colored head that dissipates to a wisp on the surface and a thin ring. There's a small amount of spotty lacing but it never promises to deliver anything more.  S: Deep roasted malt, dark bitter chocolate, bitter coffee, vanilla and alcohol. The whisky-like alcohol becomes stronger as the drink progresses. I have to be honest that I am just not a fan of beers that scream heavy alcohol. It's just my personal taste.  T: Holy moly. Interesting stuff. It was worth getting that wood from the jungle because I am not quite sure you could produce that flavor easily any other way. First blush was a kinda vanilla and licorice. A deeper tasting revealed a licorice tangy sweetness, a spiciness with a deep, earthy, rich, burned, smokey, roasted malt. It's a hard flavor to put into words. At times, it has the dryness and dark fruit which gives it a dry red wine quality. Are you getting the impression from reading this that I am finding it complex? &#9786; There's an alcohol burn there but not too bad. It definitely has that warming effect as you sip. I am not someone who goes wild with flavor descriptions in reviews but I have to admit that I feel like I may not have adequately covered off on all the things going on in this brew. You are just going to have to try it for yourself.  M: Mouthfeel is full, smooth and a little slick. There is a surprising amount of fine carbonation which works for me. I think it could become too heavy without the liveliness that the carbonation brings.  D: This may be classified as a brown ale by DFH but it has no business being called a brown ale. It's more like a strong ale but can come across in some ways like a RIS. I loved having the opportunity of trying it. It is definitely a great beer but it's too sweet and tangy and heavy in alcohol for my personal taste. At 12ABV, the beer is in the drivers seat - not the poor fool who is sipping it. You have to give it a try. It's one of those beers that makes you re-evaluate what beers are and can be. DFH may be surrounded by ridiculous hype but drinking a brew like this reminds me that their brand reputation is built on some real beer making prowess and pioneering spirit.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,surfer4life,4.67,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle.  A - Dark, probably the darkest and thickest looking brown I've had. Small thin chocolate colored head quickly resolves to little more than a film around the edge of the glass.  S - Without even putting the glass to my nose, I could smell the alcohol. At first you would almost think it a stout. Deep scents of dark chocolate dominate with hints of coffee. Beyond that sweeter fruits cherries, dates and figs can be detected with some molasses maltiness.  T - Very sweet on the front, could almost think this a belgian dark strong because of the spices you taste in the front along with strong raisin and apple tastes. Immediatley followed my some hoppy balance and some bitterness from the dark chocolate flavor. The finish is straight alcohol. Wonderful.  M - Heavy bodied with excellent carbonation, alcohol warming is perfect and keeps the mouth tingling for a while.  D - So very drinkable, but such a high alcohol content, I may need a taxi after a few of these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

A very thin brown head comes up and then falls fast to a ring around the glass. S= Lots of wood and vanilla coming from the smell. Some darker malts also come in and maybe a little maple syrup as well. T= Very woody! Tasty vanilla and coffee chocolate flavor. Great flavor and very unique complexity. A slight alcohol touch is noticeable as well. M= Thick and covering is the best way I can describe it. D= Pretty good. Nice beer. I'm really happy I got to try it and I will be seeking it out again soon. Great beer.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,ncstateplaya,4.24,"A: Damn this ""brown"" pours like a stout. It appears a very dense dark brown to black. The head is nice and calming, a peanut butter color and creamy. The head was initially a good 1/4"", but dissipates to barely cap the surface. There was very subtle lacing.  S: The nose is full of sweet rich vanilla tones on an oaky/woody background. Reminiscent of molasses and sugar cookies. This beer simply smells like a dessert table during the holidays. Amazing how the alcohol is hidden within these bakery sweet aromas.  T: Very oaky with a burst of alcohol. Abundant licorice/sassafras flavors with undertones of sweet caramel. Subtle hints of vanilla pair well with the alcohol. Very cognacesque.  M: Surprisingly, this beer was on the lighter side of medium bodied with very lively carbonation. This was completely unexpected, and the beer was much lighter than I had anticipated. The alcohol could be felt with the deep down warming sensation of your insides.  D: This beer is very unique and extremely complex. It is very enjoyable but the 12% ABV is easily the limiting factor.

Smell: Dark malts, caramel, toffee, merlot, sweet molasses (not blackstrap), nutty, with some fresh-cut wet, young wood and fruits (raisin, cherry, strawberry, plum).  Taste: Similar - dark malts, wheat bread, caramel, toffee, nuts, fresh-cut wet (not oak, this has a touch of pepper and cinnamon), young wood, fruits (raisin, cherry, strawberry, plum).

The appearance was the same as any aged brown ale, but the aroma was absolutely incredible! The Paraguayan Palo Santo wood truly made for a unique ""Holy"" experience. This is yet another great beer from the definition of American Breweries, Dogfish Head. The initial almost over barring flavor of burnt sweet wood hits the tip of your tongue. Then as the alcohol starts to tingle a wonderful caramel, and vanilla flavor comes out.

Appearance: Dark, dark brown, almost black, with a surprisingly full layer of off-white, slightly brown, head. The head took awhile to subside, and a thin layer of brown foam lingered for most of the glass. Considering the ABV, I was impressed.  Smell: No hiding the booze in this one. Alcohol, mixed with caramel and coffee notes, some vanilla seep through. Very balanced on the nose. Not as powerful of an aroma as I would have expected, but still, very nice.  Taste: Wow. The alcohol is definitely present, but it doesn't burn - instead, it complements the rest of the flavors. Caramel, coffee, and vanilla all combine for an exceptionally smooth taste. This doesn't taste like any brown ale I've ever had before...it's closer to a baltic porter. Very, very well done. The finish is smooth and satisfying.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, and perfectly carbonated. Not thick enough to be chewy, but that's not what I'd want in a brown ale anyway. Coats the tongue and mouth.  Drinkability: Well, one was definitely enough, but this isn't the type of beer you'd want more than one of at a time, anyway. Great sipping beer, and one I very much enjoyed.

10099,33832,rayjay,4.47,"Purchased in CA (whoo hoo!) and poured into my brand-new DFH stemmed goblet thanks to my awesome fiancee!  Looks elegant like a fine glass of red wine but with fizz! One dark brown beer, looks like a dubbel. Some foam but not much, which I've found typical of DFH from day one.  Huge sweet malty nose accented by notes of old dusty wood. Smells a lot like a dubbel too.  Great tasting, well made beer. Main tones come from the malt; sweet, carmel, sticky, deep dark multi grain bread, some dustiness, even a bit of a red wine character. Alcohol? What alcohol? I must force myself to slow down and enjoy the subtleties!  Big time dubbel qualities while maintaining it's own thing, and still more drinkable than most quads! Lots of dark dried fruit esters accent the Belgian appeal.  Chewy mouthfeel, light on carbonation and dense from the big malt body. Refreshing qualities keep it from becoming too thick or syrupy, though both are there and kept in check.  One of my favorite DFH offerings to date. Really good stuff with cellar potential; I think this one is about 6-8 months old in the bottle.  Seek and consume. Bring WWS and 60 Minute to CA please!

Dark malts, milk chocolate mixed with raisins and figs. Also caramelized malts mixed with bitter, almost tasteless green apple. Just off the smell, feel like the taste will be cloying. T: Not as intense, and pleasantly so, as was expecting from the smell. Alcohol not very noticeable, especially given the 12%. The figs jump out at the beginning, but switch into a smoked woody flavor. Finishes with a bit of pine and butter. M: Not like any brown ale I've had before. Not too thick but still pretty heavy.

10099,33832,stewart124,4.72,Pours a very dark brown that is almost black with a thin tan lacing of a head.  Lots of roasted and burnt character in the nose. Some fig and caramel hints.  Very smooth flavor and just the trace of that 12% alcohol in the finish. Very beautifully wound together after a year in the cellar. Nice big malt background with a trace of vanilla and lots of burnt malts. There is an earthy feeling from this that has to be the palo santo wood. The finish really makes me feel like I'm around the camp fire. So smooth with a nice bite at the end.  This is a very good brown ale and it's most certainly off-center.  I think this aged well and rounded some of the edges. This becomes a very drinkable brown ale,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,cavedave,4.52,"Unlike others here I am a writer who also happens to be an extreme lover of fine beer, not a ""pro"" reviewer, so take this for what it's worth.  The remarkably fruity esters of this brew are of such a delicious nature, full of strong notes of peach, cherry, vanilla, and grape, framed by sensual under-aromas of oaky herbosity, that the thick fragrances of them literally set my saliva glands into hyperdrive. I long for the first sip, but can not bring my nose away from the rim of my glass. I swirl it. Each inhale is different from its predecessor. The peach is strong, then the cherry, the vanilla fades but does not desist, and as it settles in the glass the caramely goodness of it comes through more strongly, behind it the warmth of alcohol, hidden no more, beckoning. My saliva glands celebrate increasingly with fits of anticipation and joy.  The look of this is remarkable as well. It is astoundingly thick. It is brutally opaque. It is deepest darkest mahogany brown. It lives and breathes like some benevolent and all-knowing alien in my glass. A thin, dark beige head quickly dissipates, but leaves ample clinging waves of lace. It is so thick I can barely see carbonation without looking closely. I have the feeling I could use a spatula and peel the lace like batter.  The first sip. Ahh, the reward for prolonging this. I am greeted by a starburst of fruit and alcohol, a firework of flavor, cherry, peach, watermelon, caramel, vanilla, deep malted darkness, which holds for an impossibly long time. It is almost edible, so thick and rich is this, it could be a bakery item if it were congealed. My mind stimulates through a wonderful registry of these finest tastes, each understanding hits notes of happiness, ones only rarely activated.  The finish eventually comes, the brew is so thick I seem to swallow it in slow motion. This is not beer, it is an epiphany, a poem; a song dedicated to all that is fine in the world. It is an extension of the sip and a crescendo of the same themes, climaxing finally in Miles Davis sharp yet rounded notes of heat, ending in mystery that lingers and becomes lusciously indefinable.  Two more sips. The warmth accentuates the beauty of the flavor, the darker, wine-like notes expand, the fruitiness and vanilla morph into a danker representation . One more sip. I close my eyes. The flavor becomes even more robust and seductive, it is like an acid trip for my tongue and nose.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Bottle to wine glass, deep amber-tinged dark chestnut pour, one finger red-brwon head that quickly thins but doesn't go away. Some globs of foam stick to the glass but no lacing.  Full, malty aroma, sweet and some anise - total effect is similar to Jagermeister  Malty but not overly sweet. vanilla and cantaloupe presence which is odd. Alcohol notes.  Round mouthfeel at times but often a crisper, drier finish than expected.  Good, solid drinkability but I wouldn't want more than one a sitting.

This is one I can spend almost an hour enjoying which I routinely do at their pub. There is nothing better than spending an hour watching a game and nursing a glass of this stuff.

On the first taste, more than the taste, I noticed the beer sticking in my mouth for a while. A rich taste, a bit of chocolate taste, a bit of sweet, dark malts, the alcohol blends in to intensify the taste. I'd really like to smell the palo santo wood to know which part it contributes.

It is an extremely dark brown/red. Almost no head at all, what did form was very thin and dark. Pours thick. Smell is pleasant,- I detect an undestated smokey malt scent, although not overwhleming. I expected more woody aromas, especially considering the hype around the wood tanks I read so much about. Taste, to this drinker, was very similar to a porter- earthy, malty, but you defnitely get some wood flavoring and a subtle spice on the tongue and throat. Mouthfeel was suprising- very complex- almost oily, with light spice, sort of coats the mouth and hangs around- the taste lingers a long while. Drinkability is not high, at least not for this beer guy. While this is a very well crafted beer, I found it very tough to drink more than 1 in a sitting. It's got a strong personality.

Tons of red and black licorice, bread, lots of malt, cherries, raisins, some brown sugar and molasses. The alcohol burn is right there and demands that you recognize the 12%. Light, but still there, carbonation - not as silky as I would have imagined.  Whoa. This is a sipper of the highest order.

I still think they're a great company but over the years I kind of got sick of the 90min, the 120 and WWS and all their zany ingredients in general. I guess I was feeling anti-extreme, and I just wanted a well-crafter beer with 4 ingredients. A friend recently suggested this beer to me again and it's renewed my interest! Pours a thick-looking opaque brown with head of small bubbles. This beer has so much character. Initially sweet and malty with brown sugar and licorice notes. Not much bitterness to this beer at all, but it's rounded out by a very bold and robust woodsy-ness imparted from the Palo Santo barrels built specifically to make this beer. This is the main attraction here. Carmel, nutty, and almost a bit smoky. Lush and smooth on the palate. A really interesting beer that I tend to drink towards the end of the night. Quite relaxing.

10099,33832,gmfessen,4.42,"Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass, beer is darker than I was expecting from a ""brown ale"", looks more like a porter or stout. A very dark brown on the pour, appears black in the glass with a thin, effervescent head that quickly dissipates to a thin bubbly ring around the rim of the glass. Nice lacing as I gently let the beer slide around the snifter walls. The smell is very apparent and complex. Underlying sweet malt comprised of dark fruits, black licorice, star anise, bourbon, and roasted notes like bittersweet chocolate and lightly toasted coffee. The alcohol is there but not in an offensive fusel alcohol way. The flavor matches the smell and then adds a whole new layer of complexity. The dark fruit component is represented by dates, figs, raisins and anise. Once you get past the initial sweetness, there is a good bitterness balance but no hops are evident. The bourbon-esk flavor produced from the wood is apparent. The finale is a big hit of alcohol that really wakes you up and reminds you that you're drinking a 12% abv beer. The ethanol tends to linger as well as the dark malty flavors but in a much more subdued role than the alcohol. The mouthfeel is what you might expect from a beer this big - full bodied with a creamy, rich carbonation. There is a definite warming effect from the alcohol. Overall, a very drinkable beer from the aspect of being likable but definitely one you would want to sip and enjoy. Also, for nearly $16 for a four-pack you may be encouraged to drink it a little slower anyways!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

The 2 fingered mocha brown head is thick & creamy with good retention, and settles to a thick cap on the surface.  A: Slightly roasted malts, cocoa powder, vanilla, dark fruits, and alcohol.  T: Malty sweet from the start. Roasted malts lay the base for vanilla, nuts, dark fruits reminiscent of raisins, figs, prunes, and charred wood to frolick about happily in the mouth. Cocoa powder seems to come out nicely on the back end & ride through the finish. Alcohol is noticeably bourbon and contributes to the profile rather than intruding, while providing some good warmth to the soul. This is damn tasty!  M & D: Palo Santo Marron's mouthfeel is superb! It's full-bodied, thick & chewy, rich & indulgent, and creamy smooth. Feels like a stout. Drinkability is good, but the ABV would probably prevent me from drinking more than 2 at a time.

I've been wanting to try and trade for one of these brews for a long time but always had way too many other irons in the fire... Leave it to Chuck to throw it down as 1 of 4!! extras in a box of 6 beers.. Badass!  I am not gonna wait any longer.... pouring it into my trusty big red wine balloon.. 3/4"" Khaki tan head has little retention yet surprisingly great lace.. and the brew is dark with great red highlites that only show when held to the brightest bare bulb..  The nose is amazingly rich.. spicy and fruity.. vanilla and chocolate.. toasty.. dark rye bread (?)... lite kirsch?  Blam!! the palate is way more concentrated than the aroma.. all of the above with tannic red grape skins and dark underripe cherries.. still some chocolate and hints of smoke and even jerky.. sorta boozy throughout, but not in a really bad way, more just adding to the overall huge complexity.. finish has a component that I can only say reminds me of pumpkin pie spice without the cloves or ginger and cinnamon (Does that make sense?? because I am struggling to figure it out.) plenty of caramel and deep maltiness is all through this brew.. more tannic red wine notes as it warms.. front of the tongue cherries show with increased temperature..  Huge body and smooth moderate carbonation makes it easier drinking than I was expecting.. but the complexity makes me force it to be a looong sipper... a nice nip or two.. walk away.. fuck with the cats.. come back and repeat..  This is really pretty great right now and honestly surprisingly there is not any ""real"" hype surrounding it.. I could see putting some of these down for years and only sampling them with the best of friends for some time to come...

Smells strongly of wood, the barrel aging is very evident. A little bit of hops mingle with some sweetness in the background. Very little alcohol smell. The taste is very earthy at first, the wood comes out and gives an almost astringent flavor to the brew. It is followed by a maple syrup sweetness mingling with citrus and floral hops. Very nice. The wood is what really sets this beer off, and like all DFH children, this one has an interesting story. The mouthfeel is nice, a bit light on the carbonation, but very big and chewy.

10099,33832,KevinBrewer,2.64,"PSM pours an opaque black with a late-releasing huge brown-sugar head that lasts and sticks to the sides of the glass. Looks more like an imperial stout than a brown ale, but I'll give DFH the benefit of the doubt since this is an unorthodox brew.  The first thing to hit your nostrils is a spicy phenolic, resinous, medicinal character that almost makes you dizzy. If you can get past that, you will smell sweet cherry wood with milk chocolate and toasty, cakey malt.  Tastes of sweet, chocolaty, cakey malt with the same peppery, phenolic, medicinal quality that was in the aroma. Warming alcohol. The medicinal character stays until the end. Slightly fruity woodiness in the middle with a dry chocolate bitterness in the finish. Aftertaste of dry grassy hops and wood.  Heavy, sticky body. It sticks all over the insides of my mouth. Not typical for a brown ale. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt again because it added to the enjoyability. Moderate carbonation.  A little boozy and heavy to be a session beer, although it was an interesting experience.  I was pretty excited about trying this beer, and I'm still unsure what to make of it. For originality and intrigue, I give this beer 10/10, but I wouldn't drink this on a regular basis. I also would not offer it to a friend and expect them to like it. Maybe it was the strange medicinal character of the wood that I'm not used to.

10099,33832,GratefulBeerGuy,3.82,"12 oz. bottle &gt; dimpled mug  This one gushes out with a heavy, dark look. Very dark brown color, opaque with a 1"" deep, dark mocha head, slow dissipation and obvious carbonation around the edges. A total foamy coverage is left over at all times after the dissipation.  The aroma is very inviting with sweet cocoa, raw heather honey, blueberry pie, sandlewood incense, liquified Rollo's candies, musty, beach and cedar woods; slightly smokey with almonds and crushed peacan's. On a more subtle level there's, sour fruits with sweet dates...inviting for sure.  The flavor of this brew hits the palate like a missle from a stealth Bomber...you just don't know what just hit you! Same goes for the feel; it's like an oil slick on the tongue...hefty and oily! I've had Imperial Stouts that had a lighter feel overall. It has a decent snap in the middle and plenty of heat to add a warming rush to dry it out. It's a heavy liquid. The heat comes on sharp and hot. There's a bitterness from the and warmth that reminds me of whiskey with hops! You ride the hot, bitter wave for a long time before a chalky cocoa-chocolate smooth it out, but just a bit. The sweetness of the malt that's in the nose just doesn't come across in the flavor, even at room temp. complexity is very high and this is a hard beer to define and it takes some serious pondering. The Palo Santo wood plays a very big role on the flavor as it deliver's a cedar-smokey malt edge that is one part brown ale and another part imperial stout-like. Rostie nutiness with a dry, hoppy-bitterness for balance.  Yes, My lips are sticky, but it's a long, long dry, hot bitter finish is rather unpleasant, yet interesting. Bitter chocolate and high earthy PH balance-earthy hop with big alpha acid's really takes it's toll on the palate. Fun to contemplate, hard to drink. The 12% abv is a sneaky devil.

Mouth feel is easy and thin. Overall I would guzzle this down and go looking for some hops! A really great beer,just not my style or especally price range.

APPEARANCE: Pours into my Delirium tulip a deep brown color with a lighter brown head. It starts at a finger's height and drops to a full color with a few stray bubbles.  SMELL: Dark and caramelly with distinct vanilla and toffee notes. The wood is noticeable but not intensely strong. It's also picked up some dark fruity aromas to it, perhaps from prolonged aging. In the back, there's a slight bit of hit from the alcohol.  TASTE: It's a big malty caramel, but the flavors seem light and fleeting. They go to vanilla, some burnt malt, then to burnt wood. Everything drops out on the finish, but the deep, sweet remainder of the flavor just keeps going and going. What a complex beer. I'm at a loss for words at some of what I'm tasting. But it's good!  MOUTHFEEL: Low on the carbonation. It's smooth and silky and only a tad syrupy. Thick with luxury.  DRINKABILITY: It's a big beer meant for sipping. That's for sure.

10099,33832,damienblack,4.45,"By the senses, if I didn't know better, I would say this to be an imperial stout. Pours a thick and syrupy dark brown, almost black. Mocha colored head, one finger and bubbly, leaves a neat bubble pattern in its wake. Big complex aroma, coffeeish toasted malt and vanilla are first and foremost, with some chocolate, brown sugar, oakish smell from the wood, a little nutty, like an aged impy stout and a brown ale had a love child. A little bit of banana in there too, mmm, chocolate bananas.  There is a ton going on here. Almost none of it is like your standard brown ale. Upon first taste it tastes a little like a thin imperial stout, with a big chewy mouth, and a slightly chocolate taste. After a split second you notice two more aspects, a definite oak taste from the wood it was aged in, with just a touch of smokiness, and the fact that it is a bit nutty, enhanced by the chewiness. A strange but pleasant banana flavored yeastiness doesn't feature, but is present all the way through, which adds another layer to the puzzle. Definite vanilla overtones, a little bit of chocolatey, coffee, stoutyness at the end, with a little bit of hoppiness, but the bitterness is almost nil. Just slightly roasty all the way through, not so much as a stout, but providing another layer of complexity compared to the standard brown ale. Also a lot lighter in body compared to the stout, it has an airyness to it that really helps. For me the mouthfeel is the weakest point, but it isn't watery or lacking in any definite aspect, just doesn't pack that extra punch, that extra layer. There is exactly 0% trace of the 12% abv, it is amazingly drinkable, goes down like nobody's business.  This beer goes from above average in some areas to excelling in others. I'm not a big fan of some of DFH's beers, like the IPAs, i find them way to busy for what I'm looking for. But now, it is what I'm looking for in this, and it does not dissapoint.

10099,33832,Metalmonk,4.62,"Bottled on 5/28/08 -- so this is about 9 months old.  The darkest shade of brown possible before qualifying as black, with a bubbly brown head that stays put for several minutes before thinning to a crown. A few dots and dashes of lace.  Wood tones in the nose, and just underneath them are caramel, vanilla, brown sugar and marshmallow and a healthy vinous quality bringing currants and molasses to mind. A touch of alcohol. Also has that kind of peculiar nuttiness which comes from yeast. Marvelous. The kind of beer you almost forget to actually drink because the nose is so enticing.  Flavor is complex; an alluring blend of flavor impressions, some elusive and some obvious, the whole being immensely enjoyable. The overall flavor is a blending of wood and what seems like lightly burnt molasses--this forms the basis for all kinds of other flavors to arise: currants, truffles, marshmallow, vanilla extract, licorice, sherry.  Mouth is neither over-carbonated nor super-round. Just pretty mellow in the mouth. A little bit of tart flavor carries over into a pucker, but the texture is quite subtle, if just slightly sticky.  Pretty close to transcendent. While the mouthfeel or appearance didn't blow me away, there's nothing wrong there. The nose and especially the flavor are freaking out of this world. Even the 12% alcohol is incorporated well. Another thing I like about this is that even though wood (specifically, Palo Santo wood from Paraguay) is the main reason for this beer's complex character, wood is far from the most notable flavor characteristic.

Taste is rich, full-bodied malt sweetness up front, delicious vanilla and some toast. Ripe fruits linger in the back and give way to a rich roasted chocolate flavor with some big woody notes. Goes down smooth with a faint alcoholic warmth and leaves a thick toasted wood flavor lingering in the mouth with a faint earthy bitterness, the only evidence of hops in this brew.  Mouthfeel is great. Full bodied with a nice tight carbonation to help move the beer about. Thick and chewy, this beer goes down smooth.  Overall, a beautiful - and different - beer.

Smells distinctly woody with notes of both light chocolate, some caramel and some dark fruits.  This is a great tasting beer. The dark fruits from the nose are fairly pronounced and the caramel and chocolate take a back seat, but are still noticeable. The wood comes through in a serious way also. It tastes different than a standard oak-aged beer though, it is more subdued and spicy with just a touch of vanilla. A lot of beers seem to just through wood or whiskey barrels in there, and I'm not thrilled with the result. However this one works really well with the wood; it is definitely improved and would not be as good without it.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slight velvety feel. Medium carbonation also.  12% ABV? I've tried this a couple of times and had no idea that this beer was this strong. I would have guessed in the range of 8%.

This is topped by a thick, sticky, lacy head the color of cappuccino froth mixed with adobe or red stone cliffs (like those in Utah).  S: Complex! Alcohol is definitely present but not uninviting; this is combined with an extremely chewy molasses-flavored malt, date, and chocolate brownie concoction. Some vanilla extract is there too. Smoky, charred wood (burnt mulch?) aromas are in the background and define it with a rugged, backcountry character.  T: One taste of this knocked me down and out. Like someone took a hammer and bashed my head in through my taste buds. Strong phenols, followed by a chewy taste of unsweetned burnt molasses, followed by a kick reminiscent of whiskey. Seemingly Redwood or cherry wood chip-burnt hops imbibe it with a strong, smoky yet bitter hop taste. Alcohol pulls through again in the aftertaste, with the same pungency and numbness on the tongue that you get from good cigars.  M: Extremely smooth; somewhat like drinking Bailey's irish cream.  D: Definitely need to sip this one.  This beer definitely killed me; the 12% alcohol more than shows immediately, and goes straight to the head. BEWARE of this one. I'm glad I tried it but it might be a while until I have it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,isubsmith,4.32,"My friend Chad brought me back a 4pack from LaCrosse - thanks Chad.  Extremely dark brown, very opaque, little to no head.  Smell was interesting. Some strong notes of the alcohol, but then lots of vanilla and almost a perfume smell. A bit of coffee/dark chocolate, but the perfume smell lingered. Not exactly sure how to describe it, but maybe a kind of floral mix with a fresh cut hard wood smell. I'm sure I've smelled it before, or something similar to it, when cutting exotic woods in the shop. It was very unique.  Taste wasn't nearly as strong or differentiating as the nose, but it was still good. Reminded me a lot of Belgian beers actually. I'm not sure if they use candy sugar in here or maybe a Belgian yeast, but I wouldn't be surprised. The alcohol certainly is not hidden. Very sweet, malty sorts of tastes.  Mouthfeel was rather thick, almost syrupy but not in a bad way. Definately coats the inside of the mouth.  Generally a good beer, I'll certainly seek out more if I can. Also, definately NOT a session beer, but mostly because the 12% would do you in and it's probably a little overly sweet.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Smells of very ripe sweet bananas, some vanilla, slightly of chlorine. Taste is better than the smell, lots of vanilla, raisins, bananas, ethanol, raisins, brown sugar, cocoa krispies. Finish and aftertaste is of bananas and oatmeal, some astringency. Heavy body coats the tongue. Alcohol is present throughout, surprisingly not very hot for 12%.  Tasty and interesting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

A thin 1/2"" bit of head. A nice thick, almost creamy head. Head is a nice light brown in color.  Smell is of coffee, chocolate, and a bit of vanilla all blended with a nice dose of alcohol. Almost reminds me of a brownie.  Was taken back at the first taste. All I could taste was wood, and in not a particularly good way. However, the successive tastes were much more pleasant. Again coffee. Some chocolate. Very long, lingering, sweetish finish.  Mouthfeel is a medium-thick. Definitely has a bit of heft and gives the mouth a good coating.  It's a very nice beer, but it's a sipper. Couldn't see drinking more than one of these at a sitting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,JayNH,3.98,"A- Pours thick and black with a solid foamy tan head. This brew just looks intimidating...  S- A stiff alcohol warmth, a strong syrupy sweet malt. A smokey wooden note in the background.  T- Very heavy and sweet, quite boozy, wood and a grassy hoppiness show up in the aftertaste. A bit of spicy vanilla tries to fight it's way through the alcohol and sweetness.  M- quite smooth and creamy, plenty of alcohol warmth on the palate.  D- Good but one would be enough for me. Drinking a four pack of these WILL put hair on your chest.  This is a serious brew. I don't know if it doesn't need it's own category like an Imperial Brown. It almost has to be judged on it's own merits rather than against the American Brown style, IMHO.

Big, rich caramel malt, also sweet, and only getting a hint of vanilla.  Wow, this is very. . . different. Very woody with tremendous and aggressive spice, hints of sweetness and syrup. The wood is so intense and spicy, it actually reminds me of a well-aged golden tequila.  Medium body and carbonation with a noticeable alcohol burn.  I have mixed feelings on this. On one hand, I love how aggressive and unique it is, on the other hand, it is borderline overwhelming, and completely pushes the envelope, yet I crave more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Finishes with subdued splash of alcohol and wood aging.  M- Rich and complex, nicely robust in it viscosity.  D- This is such an impressive beer.

Aroma is sweet and roasty, with notes of bootshop (more on this below). Mouthfeel is something to write home about... thick and creamy. In wine tasting I've always heard the ""Leathery"" descriptor, but this beer is accurately described as ""leathery"", and I mean that in the best way possible. The wood they age this in must be magical. Gives a tannic pinch to at the end of the swallow. Drinkabililty might not be high due to the alcohol, and how thick, rich, and complex this is.

That Palo Alto wood works miracles!  Mouthfeel - Pure velvet. Nice slight burn from the ABV. Yum...  Overall the best 'brown ale' I've ever had.

Completely black in color, hard to find any variance in hue. Nose drips black, golden raisins, dates, rum cake, pan-seared molasses, very boozy, malted milk balls, sticks like glue to your nostril pores, some notes of sharper green apple, thick enough texturally that you enjoy it more just getting steamrolled than trying to pick this apart from that. Full-bodied, as in the nose you feel the warmth of the alcohol but no burn nor bite. All about roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, molasses, rum, and French vanilla ice cream flavors. Green grape, fig, raisin, date, plum fruit alternate between freshness and dried fruit sweetness. Carbonation is sneaky strong, anything which can stir this brew has muscles. A touch of orange or grapefruit at the end reminds you that hops must be a component of the finished product.

In the background of the beer you can smell raisin and a very low fruity esters.  Taste: A very rich toasted malt, alcohol, caramel, molasses, nuts and a wonderful woodiness in the beer. The background of the beer is raisins, toffee, citrus, and there is low fruity esters.  Overall: The beer is super rich dark brown ale. The beer mouth feel is carbonated and warming.

The smell is a little boozy with sweet brown sugar dominating and a hint of vanilla. The taste really hides the alcohol, brown sugar then quickly followed by a slightly bitter piney flavor. The bitterness hangs around more than the sweetness, I like the way the taste keeps going even after it is swallowed, normally this is a bad thing but here it is very good.

Some chocolate and vanilla nose their way in as well. Intriguing scent.  Taste is of sweet malts, rum-soaked cherries. Lots going on-just hard to pick it all out. Sweet vanilla cake frosting--There is definitely a sweet pastry smell just oozing from this one. Some dark fruits as it warms. Ginger. Intense cinnamon roll taste as it warms...delicious.

No head, no problem. Nice.  Aroma is big on vanilla, but some deeper dark chocolate notes are there as well as an earthy roasty malt profile. Nothing in the hop department. Tastes of vanilla, sherry-like plum notes, warm with alcohol, chocolate. It sometimes wants to be an RIS, but it's very different at the same time. Just saying it has some similar qualities. Finishes dry, does not linger but does leave you longing for another sip.  Body is not as big as the RIS, but still full and fulfilling. I sipped this throughout my entire dinner and beyond.

Some earthyness as it goes to the back of the throat and it finishes slightly bitter. Alcohol is well hidden, I'm guessing that it shows in the some of the dark fruityness.

A 1 cm almond brown head which dissipated within about a minute. Great lace left in the glass after repeated sips. Body allows absolutely no light to get through. This looks like an imperial stout to me but as they say, DFH beers defy categorization.  S Thin chocolate, dark dark malt but very sweet. Not a strong smell to me but that is appropriate to the style (be it Brown Ale or Stout).  T Chocolate, coffee sweet elixir with a kick of alcohol near the end. Simply divine. This is why I advocate for beer. Really complex with tastes of chocolate covered dark fruits, maybe some strawberries, some coffee and even some black licorice.  M Maybe the best feature. So damn smooth with a great syrupy stickiness that lingers far into the aftertaste. Some carbonation but it is subtle. Simply a great mouthfeel.  D Cannot be improved upon.

All backed by the clear scent of wood and oak. Hints of cherries, spice... the list goes on and on. Outstanding smelling brew.  Taste is ridiculously complex. Chocolate malts, molasses, rum dipped fruits - raisins, strawberries, cherries - with wisps of purple grapes and vanilla. Red-wine flavor somewhere in the middle. The wood element is noticed during the finish, preceded by a distinct and unique roast-y flavor. Nice alcohol wisp during the finish as well.  Thick, rich, and creamy in the mouth. Definite viscous feel to it. Full bodied. Carbonation is spot on - one aspect I think completes this brew. Alcohol is warming but definitely not anything crazy.

10099,33832,TexIndy,3.08,"Poured from a 12oz bottle that I brought back from Indy into a pint glass. Lasered bottled on date of 7/24/08. Was a deep black color even against the light. Lots of carbonation with quick slide lacing. It had an average sized brown head that slowly settled into a thin collar with small wisps of foam. The head was interesting in that it had large bubbles almost like a soda.  The aroma was woody, malty and vanilla. Also lots of dark fruit and alcohol which isn't unexpected since 12% ABV. The taste pretty much followed the aroma. Not a fan of the dark fruits and most wood flavors so this one misses the mark. Also the alcohol was too present. I've had many in this ABV range that hide it better.  Overall, an OK beer from an overrated brewery. While I appreciate their creativity, I find their beers usually aren't for me.

Darky and Murky like an imperial stout- obviously another extreme beer from DFH that defies categorization- rather than an imperial brown.  S- Wow, the nose on this is huge. Really jumps out at you. Definitely strongly of molasses and vanilla bean, a bit of scotch earthiness and subtly roasted chocolate malts....no aroma hops to speak of.  T- WOW. This beer is insanely complex, robust, and subtle all at once. There is a big alcohol hit right up front, but not too overpowering. Subsides and gives way to a big, chewy chocolate and crystal malt foundation that plays very nicely off the vanilla and brown sugar flavors. A bit of nuttiness and a hint of caramel. There's definitely a unique flavor imparted by the wood which is hard to describe....an earthy rummy flavor...a palo santo-y flavor?? Just enough bittering hops to balance out the flavors. Very delicious.  M- Medium to full bodied. Certaintly thicker than you'd expect from even an imperial brown ale, a bit chewy but not to the point of being syrupy. Mild carbonation that perfectly envelopes and carries the flavors.  D- Wow, this is some beer. DFH really knows how to make a beer that is completely different, and this one is a raving success. Each swallow is another adventure for your palate. Great stuff. The only thing that would keep me from having too many would be getting very hammered.

10099,33832,Sycodrummer,4.7,"Poured from the 12oz. bottle into an oversized bulbous snifter the beer struggled to form a head but a sliver of dark tan near brown head formed atop a deep brown, near black beer. The final drops of beer fell from the glass like chocolate syrup drizle on top of the creamy sliver of head. Head was quick to settle but left some traces of lacing along the side of the glass.  The nose hits with alcohol right up front: hints of dark rum. Oaky woodstove buring with tobacco, chocolate, brown sugar and roaster caramel (think carmalized brown sugar on a rack of ribs).  The taste has the alcohol hit right up front but its very smooth and not overpowering. A big malty chewy backbone with brown suggar and mollasses. The taste is sweet but not cloying and does not get to viscous or syrupy. Hints of dark fruit, rum, and chocolate covered raison all come through.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, not asmuch as the sweetness would indicate, never syrupy, but chewy and able to support its ABV.  This is a very nice sipper on a cold day. Not a beer to entertain several of in one sitting, but a perfect nite cap. Sweet like a sherry with a good balance of flavor. A very enjoyable beer. A hefty tag - I paid $12/4 pack but I've seen as high as $18/4 pack. That notwithstanding, worth seeking out and enjoying. This is not what many would consider your typical brown ale, but then, few things from DFH are ever typical, and my taste buds don't seem to mind.

I've never seen a 12% ale that could produce such a head. It sits opaque in the pint glass.  S: This beer is impressively aromatic. Roast barley, toast, caramel, vanilla, and many more flavors come through in this amazingly complex bouquet.  T: Amazing. Deep maltiness in the front, followed by chocolate, smoke, and what I beleive is the Palo Santo wood. The flavors come at you in waves.  M: Very full body with a chewy character.

S: The aroma is of roasted malts, vanilla, caramel, milk chocolate, a touch of dark fruit and a touch of hops.  T: The taste is very smoky up front with sweet flavors of caramel, vanilla and chocolate. There's a hearty stout-like malt character and a mild but complimentary hops presence. The high 12.00% ABV is well-disguised. The after-taste is slightly sweet.  M: Crisp and smooth, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, slightly sticky finish.

10099,33832,Klgkenny,3.11,"Poured from a fridge temp bottle into room temp pint glass.  A couple of fingers worth of dark khaki colored head slowly dissipates over an uber dark brown/black body. Almost opaque, when held up to a source of light one can glimpse brown highlights at the edge.  A big nose on this one. Dark fruits and spice are almost drowned by the fumes of alcohol which are so thick that they are almost visible. The massive complexity confuses my olfactory analyzations.  As with the aromas, alcohol dominates... And when that is combined with fruit and spice, it leaves me with memories of being force-fed cough medicine as a kid. Not hugely negative, this taste just doesn't do it for me, especially for the price.  The best aspect of this beer was the mouthfeel. Round and creamy. Thick bodied. Beautiful. Huge mouthfeel.  Not so drinkable. The huge taste combined with the huge abv are just too much.  To summarize, this beer probably has a very devoted cult following, but other than that minority, this is a one-timer, or at best, a once in a while when the mood is right.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Very unusual taste.. bit very good taste as well. Some brown sugar and more vanilla, slight alcohol taste can be tasted but it is quickly subdued by the sweetness of the malt. Nice mouthfeel to it and good finish. You can really feel it warming you up, as it's about 3 x the strength of the average beer. I've been dying to try this beer and a long day of shoveling seemed to be a good opportunity to enjoy one.

Strong aromas of sweet malts, chocolate and cherries. Complex flavor profile featured chocolate and dark fruit, mostly cherry, and included licorice, caramel and a distinctive fresh wood sensation as expected. Medium body, minimal carbonation, and a pleasant malt aftertaste. Very little in terms of hops bitterness, but it's there if you look for it. Alcohol is evident and warming. The palo santo wood is a very interesting addition and makes this a very special treat. Definitely on my top 5.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,PatrickJR,3.37,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into oversized snifter, as this glass seemed most appropriate considering this beer's description.  A - Deep, dark brown, opaque. Light comes through on the edges to reveal brown highlights. Quarter inch of rust-colored head rises with moderate to short retention. Some lacing.  S - Excellent aroma. Lots of wood with a healthy backing of vanilla and caramel. Touches of anise and dark fruit are accentuated by a strong alcohol presence. Buttery, chocolate, and roasted notes are noted as well.  T - What a spectacular letdown. The taste is just wood wood wood with a dose of char and asphault. There's a mineral-tinged butteriness hiding somewhere mid palate but it is most overshadowed by the sensation of chewing on a block of wood. Booze hits hard near the finish with absolutely no sweetness to counteract. Following is a massive crushed-aspirin sort of a bitterness that is almost too much to bear.  M - Full bodied with a moderate carbonation. Perhaps a little too big in body.  D - While I will praise Palo Santo Marron for being another unique offering from DFH, it is almost undrinkable. Alcohol aside, the wood is just too much. Judging from the nose there are other things going on in this brew, but once it hits the tastebuds the wood overpowers most anything else.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

S- Yep, It's that wood smell, vanilla and a bit of alcohol.  T-There is a bit going on here, dark malt favors to start, some dark fruits like raisins and figs + vanilla through the middle and finishes with a light alcohol taste.  M-Is fairly thick and dry.  D-With the high ABV I wouldn't say you can drink a lot but it is a flavorable sipper that I might like to try two of sometime.  Not exactly fit to style this is still an interesting beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,association330,4.1,"Bottle dated 07/24/08  A - Pours very dark brown, almost black. A creamy, mocha-colored cap forms, and looks like the crema on top of a shot of espresso. Lasts at length, with nice sheets and legs of lacing.  S - Oaky, vanilla, molasses, melted brown sugar, very noticeable raw alcohol (has an almost acetone-like quality; I think it's a little harsh). Acidic/sour burnt malt and fig/raisin notes.  T - Wow, there is a lot going on here. A sweet, intensely malty backbone is infused with distinct, barrel-aged characteristics. There are some buttery tones, with oak, vanilla, molasses, milk chocolate, and toffee present. Dark fruit notes. Bitter finish, with coffee, sweet malt, and woody essences lingering on the tongue.  M - Warming, and slightly numbing/peppery alcohol, which is not surprising given the 12% ABV. Surprisingly medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a creamy smoothness.  D - This is definitely a nightcap sipper and not a session beer.  I'm not entirely sure one could call this a brown ale, but it definitely tries to redefine the boundaries of the style. It's a sipping brown, not a standard, easy-drinking brown. The complexities brought on by barrel-aging are enjoyable with this brew, and best savored slowly. Thumbs up to DFH on this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,BARFLYB,4.3,"12oz bottle poured into a dogfish pint glass. Bottled on 9-9-08. This is my 2nd try at this beer in a bottle as it needed some time to mellow.  A- DFH Palo Santo pours a very deep color bordering on black with brown to red shades towards the edge of the glass.One of the darkest brown ales i've seen. A nice tan head with minimal retention breaks down into a few spots here and there. Minimal lacing also.  S- A great departure from a lot of DHF high ABV offerings with less emphasis on fruits and sugars although they are there. What I am getting is a lot of wood presence with some vanilla background and caramel sweetness. I'm sure a variety of malts were used in this as detected in the smell with some hops. Some chocolate and coffee add another layer, a good punch of booze also.  T- So that's what Paraguayan wood tastes like. Some oak from the wood also creating a good mix. Malts malts and more malts creating a surge of vanilla and caramel sweetness. More coffee than chocolate while eben the coffee is minimal. Some dark licorice as well. A bit of fruit with some dates and figs and cherry as it warms. Alcohol is right up there in the profile while some hops come through on the backhand side. This should be labeled an imperial brown ale with all of this.  M- The body is extra medium to full blown as it coats perfectly every time. The alcohol is ever present and usually this would deter from the drink but PSM's flavors are a great offset. The hops towards the end bring a slight bitterness to it. This just gets smoother and creamier as time goes by. Good warming on the mouth and is felt in my stomach.  D- The first time i had this the bottle was about two weeks old and tasted like a hardwood floor & i could not finish the 12oz. But with even just four months on this PSM has mellowed nicely. I cant wait to see what long term aging results are. The mixture of flavors is a great change from the darker brews of winter months and i would drink two with such a high ABV.  Truth be told I did not care for this during the first bottling but I have grown to it and love Palo Santo. This is even better on tap and i will never pass up an opportunity to try it that way. Great innovation by DFH once again, i'm glad this is a seasonal now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,ctdfalconer,3.82,"Sam's singularities are always worth a try. Dogfish Head loves to surprise its drinkers by kicking out the stops and pushing the limits. Whether you like the result or not, it's always unlike anything else you've ever had. In my own brewing, I love to experiment and I never make the same recipe twice, so I admire DFH for doing it when there's real money on the line. Sure Anheuser Busch won't think twice about dumping thousands of barrels of beer if it doesn't fit into their exacting standards, but what if it turned out that Brazilian hardwoods made awful beer? That nifty new cask of Sam's was very very much not cheap. But here's the genius of DFH: They try all kinds of wild stuff and become known for it, so even if the beer isn't great, but merely drinkable (they're all good, actually), people will buy it just to say they had that latest crazy brew from Dogfish...and then they get to tell the story. When we buy Worldwide Stout or 120 Minute IPA, we're not just buying beer, we're buying the story behind it, we're buying curiosity and exploration.  The Palo Santo Marron is a grand experiment in the micro-brew world. Fortunately, the resulting beer is quite tasty indeed, and definitely not like any other beer. The perfumey aromas of the wood leap out of the glass and the vanilla-coffee-toffee-caramel notes weave nicely into the richness of the strong brown ale. The one point I would state against it is that there was a whiff of something solvent-like nailpolish remover that was a bit off-putting. This is a fresh new avenue for brewing...just because a particular wood isn't traditionally used for making barrels, doesn't mean it wouldn't give a good flavor to beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Oxymoron,3.63,"The back story behind this beer is great. Would never have thought to shoot a tree before. Pours a mostly dark shade of brown with red highlights. Good clarity. A soft white head at the pour that hid to the side of the glass through the whole tasting. Limited lacing though. Really we are calling this a brown?  The nose has a lot going on. Some complexity from the malt but is over showed by alcohol, fusel, and some strong woody notes. To start the malt is fairly sweet with some caramel and brown sugary notes. Some molasses and maple combination. The alcohol notes are very noticeable and mix with some phenols, plums, raisins, figs, pineapples and mangos.  The taste is more in check. The malt comes out as the alcohol and fusel backs off. The malt is more robust with a thickness to it but the sugary notes come out a bit more sharp. Some sweetness that is felt in the teeth, like a fluoride issue. Brown sugar notes, kettle carame and some molasses flavors with a slight minerally taste on the back end. Some meaty/smokey notes that don't really fit. The wood notes really come out nicely. More of a wood like flavor with a hint of vanilla on the back end. Very unique. There is some kick, no kidding, with the ABV. The yeast does come out with more plums and figs while the other tropical fruits back off.  The body is big and sweet. Sure its big but there is a linger sweetness that just lingers into the finish. Carbonation is a bit light which might help the balance out. I suppose this is an ager but really there is a lot going on here. And why a US brown?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,popery,3.7,"Big, sweet, medicinal, woody. I'm a little put off by the sweet medicinal flavor in this beer. That's my main thought, but I probably had too high of hopes for this one. Palo Santo Marron isn't a bad beer, but the unique woody flavor suffers from its sweetness for my palate. There is some dryness from the wood, but the mouthfeel is still fairly cloying for me. The flavor is complex, and there are some good notes in there. It's just all a bit too much. The alcohol is a bit forward for the sweet syrupy feel. I enjoy the beer, but at the price, I probably won't buy one again soon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Strong alcohol, liqueur up front that tapers quickly into a winey almost pungent flavor of the palo santo. Bitter, woody aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Foam is scarce and small bubbles and light caramel that fades quickly. Slightly thin. Smooth.  Drinkability - While the flavors seem to mellow with time, the bitter taste seems to move forward on the palate.

10099,33832,Pagzzz,4.85,"What to say ... This is so wonderful!  Aroma: Rich malty aroma, wonderfully complex with dark sugars, caramel and vanilla notes. Alcohol aromatics present, but surisingly not overpowering for a beer of 12% strength. Hops almost undetectable.  Appearance: Inky black, almost like an IRS or porter. Low head, dissapates to a thin ring around the edge. No wonder given the alcohol level.  Flavor: rich maltiness with caramel sweetness, dark fruit and very slight dark roasted character. Hop bitterness background, but balances sweetness very well. No flaws. Vanilla and light wood provide a nice counterpoint.  Mouthfeel: medium mouthfeel, but not heavy at all for a beer of this magnitude. Actually finishes fairly dry which really makes this dangerously drinkable.  This is a fantastic, unusual and unique style. $20 for a four pack is pricey, but you would pay $10 a bottle in the restaurant or bar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Woody and soaked in vanilla in a complimenting fashion, not overwhelming by any means. Caramel, chocolate, nice coffee presence that becomes more apparent as you drink. Sweet and lightly tart fruit, cherry being most apparent and possibly even raspberry. Very tasty, here. Surprisingly low level of heat for such a monster of a beer. Wide range of flavors and well balanced. Nothing is distracting or in your face. Woody character becomes a bit more apparent, imparting a slight dryness to the beer. Personally, I'm enjoying it. A moderate sweetness compliments with vanilla, caramel, and coffee most apparent. Fruit here still also. Damn, this is great. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy but again has a dryness to it thanks to the wood. A little tingle on the tongue after each sip. I easily finished a single 12 oz. serving. Might consider two.

10099,33832,taylorhamrick,3.62,"A brown ale? I think not. I have no idea what to do with this one. No idea.  This pours what I would call black, but it still looks kind of brown in the glass. There was a thin brown head, but there is actually good lacing. I'm very intrigued by the look of this. The smell is amazing. There's the wood of course. Then there's a kick of sweetness in the nose, and also a kind of spicy earthy smell. Even a flourish of ester in there. Not like a brown ale, but really, really interesting. I really want to drink it. The taste is sort of a letdown I think. Mostly wood, like alcohol soaked wood chips without any splinters. Not bad, very interesting, but this isn't a world-beater. There's also a very odd sweetness that fills your mouth, and kind of clings there, along with the woody taste. Something is almost like eating a bit of dirt, in a good way, in actually the very best way dirt could taste and feel. I'm very intrigued and enjoying it. I feel like everything I'm saying sounds kind of bad, but it's really good. The drinkability, how should I put this? I'll take one. Then maybe 6 months later, I'd be ready for the next. I'd recommend trying it, and you should certainly be able to finish it without any trouble. Doesn't compare at 12% to anything that remotely fits in the Brown Ale category. It's really, really kicks you in the ass after about half a glass.

The head was a dirty biege coloration. No retention of the head was noted. Specs of foam remain behind on my glass.  Smell: The aroma of the beer is a cleaver blending of caramel, vanilla, suggestions of hot fudge, brown sugar, melons, berries, banana, dark toasted and roasted aromas, spicey earthyness, its boozey but in the way that a nice single malt is boozey.  Taste: This beer taste good but not nearly as good as its smell. The beers flavors bring an undefinable fruityness to my mouth. Sweet honey brown sugar, vanilla, the alcohol comes across as boozey. Perhaps its the alcohol that provides the zing and dries this beer out. Dark roasted malts approach cocoa flavors but go off into a slight acidic flavor.

The best you can hope for is a dark ruby tinted brown highlight, at the edges. Medium pour produces one finger of creamy coffee colored foam. It hangs around for a little bit, but doesn't overstay it's welcome. Lacing is pretty darn good, if only a little spotty.  The smell is, well...different. I don't think that I've smelled another brew quite like this one. All of the charateristic notes are there, they just combine to make a totally unique smell. Nice maltiness is what got me first. Big notes of caramel and vanilla. Nice big oakiness. Slight booziness. Dark fruits are in abundance. Figs, dates and cherries, mostly. Slight hints of chocolate covered bananas.  Huge malty sweetness. Burnt coffee. Big dark fruits. Brown sugar and molasses. Nice smooth oakiness. Slight hints of smoke and chocolate. Caramel presence is fairly high. There are so many things going on in this bottle. It's really hard to nail it down. Very tasty and very well done brew.  Very good medium to full body. Nice and oily, in the mouth. Carbonation is low, but just right for this type of beer. It provides a nice level of creaminess, without getting in the way of the flavors.  Excellent dessert beer, here. You probably won't find yourself with the urge to drink a six-pack of these on Friday night, or anything. It's much too big of a beer for that. Very, very good beer, but mostly for special occasions.

The big aromatic nose is fruity (black currants, carmelized raisins, Mission figs, etc...) with a burnt molasses, dark chocolate, nutty coffee maltiness. Hints of licorice, roasted almonds & cherry vanilla. Somewhat vinous with a port-like quality. The flavor starts of bold with plenty of upfront roastiness followed by some sweeter butter toffee-caramel character that gives way to a moderate amount of bitterness that dries out the generous maltiness. The bittersweet chocolate finish is warming, roasty and delivers a plethora of character. This finely crafted specialty is medium-full bodied with a good creaminess, but a touch of woody astringency. PSM seems more akin to a Baltic porter than any brown ale that I've ever tasted, but why try to catergorize a good thing.

Of course I had already read it via BeerAdvocate, but appreciated the gestures nonetheless. So when I saw this on the shelf in downtown Vancouver last month, I procured a bottle for each of them (to share with me, of course). The first one vanished none too slowly, so I had better write this one down...  This beer pours a deep, dark black, with reddish tints, and a single finger of tan head, that disappears readily. The smell is prunes, dates, and an intense wood essence, that I admit I cannot identify (beyond the description on the label). The taste is floral hops, heavy black fruit, caramel, vanilla, and an acrid woodiness, again hard to describe. The carbonation is quite low, and the finish carries on the heavy woody sweetness.

At home, the beer poured into a goblet was dark brown and opaque, with a good size, medium brown head. The smell is suggestive of the alcohol content, but otherwise like other brown ales.  However, upon tasting, you know this beer is something special. Having been a wood worker for a number of years, it was really striking how you can taste the wood this beer is aged on. It adds a complexity of flavor that I have not encounted with other brown ales. Each sip conjures up hints of various flavors, resiny, vanilla, sweet, and sharp.

Potent aroma of raisins, brown sugar, toffee and chocolates. Subtle earthy hops in the background and minor nuttiness.  Full-tilt force of roasted malts up front with an immediate blockade of bittering hops; sharp, grassy hops. Alcohol is a formidable contender for attention in this beer. Warming, drying yet well contained by the overall sweetness of the beer. Huge concentrations of dark fruity esters and a sumptuous gathering of hazelnut, espresso, vanilla and pecan. The wood character derived from the Palo Santo is definitely distinguishable and is promoted through the dry, bitter finish.  Slick, silky and smooth in the mouth with a fine tingling carbonation, thick, luscious body and moderately high bitterness.  This is definitely one of the finer wood-aged beers that I've had. I can't help but wonder what other beers could gain from some time against this type of wood.

10099,33832,HalfFull,4.22,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a large wine glass. Pours black. Not kind of black, not sort of black, not black with red highlights. Just black. And with a mocha head that settles to a cap and throws some sinking lacing.  Chocolate on the nose, touch of vanilla oil and dried plum, alcohol as well. Rich with roasted malts and woody esters. I would say oak, but I guess Palo Santo is the call. A longtime craft woodworker, I've never heard of this tree, alas, it suits the brew well.  Taste reminds me of an is RIS from the get go, guess that's the ABV talking as this is an extreme Brown Ale. Not as sweet or chocolatey as an RIS however, instead offering more subtle flavors of raisin and dried cherry with complex malt undertones.

Sweet but not too much so. Again there is a definite wood note- obviously from the aging. Some nice earthy herbal hops in the finish along with a bit of warming alcohol.

Spotty bits of lacing are left around the glass. Smell is of vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, oak, roasted walnuts & chestnuts. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a sugary, prune-like, raisin filled flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied, sugary, oak filled with tannins, and raisins and prunes clinging to the palate. Wow.

10099,33832,SLeffler27,4.2,"A thick, velvety, rich, dark brown head blossoms over a mahogany, leather liquid ultimately settling to a thin lace on the walls of my pint glass.  For a simple brown ale, Palo Santo Marron stands out with warm, dark chocolate, fresh-cut wood, vanilla, toffee and wheat bread. This is no Charlie Brown.  Flavors follow the nose and add some fruits. A long bittersweet finish culminates with a strong acidic and alcohol presence. Molasses and roasted malts also carry well into the finish.  Dry and velvety smooth, with a sharp, but pleasant bite of alcohol in the finish, and softly carbonated.  Unique and able to hold its own, this one will easily fit into any regular lineup. Brown ale? Ya, right! Palo Santo Marron is an excellent example of ""off-centered"" ales. Maybe this will lead the way for less modest browns of the future.

10099,33832,yourefragile,3.92,"12 oz bottle, Sept 08 bottling, poured into a tulip.  A: Pours a very dark, opaque near black with ruby highlights and a light brown head that quickly dissipates leaving virtually no lacing. Very imposing and viscous looking for a ""brown ale"" S: Takes a couple of whiffs to take everything in, but nothing is as strong or overpowering as I expected. Dominant every time is a potent, slightly bitter, acidic pinch of alcohol. Flavors from the wood like vanilla balance this most of the time along with an occasional light dark fruit aroma. T/M: Very smooth, thick body with strong carbonation. Strong alcohol presence, but lacks burn, just a warming presence as you finish the bottle. Flavor isn't overly complex, but very rich. Strong alcohol presence and body has prominent flavors from the wood, light dark fruit flavors providing a little bitterness, some vanilla and light roasted malt. When you let it warm up and sit in the mouth a stronger nuttiness and almost spicy, hot peppery flavor starts to come through. Very nicely balanced, and alcohol is certainly present at 12% but not overwhelming. Comparing this to traditional brown ales is kind of pointless.

A dark brown head reduces quickly to a ring in my glass.  After reading about this beer in The New Yorker, I was expecting its aroma to be different. And how. It has a perfume quality -- in a good way -- which mixes with coffee and other roasted malt notes.  The taste is quite creamy and rich, with those good perfume notes adding a depth I can't describe. The high alcohol content leaves me thinking of Imperial Stouts.  The body is oily slick and creamy.  Overall this is a fine beer. It's very drinkable, considering the 12 percent alcohol level.

Taste is delicious, pretty intense and full bodied. Lots of sweet malt and molasses, some roastiness and dark fruit on the aftertaste. Heavy yet slippery mouthfeel, if anything it's slightly too soda-like in the carbonation, but that doesn't take much at all away from the overall flavor. Strong at 12%, but pretty well-hidden and smooth. I think the Palo Santo wood aging has something to do with the smoothness of this brew. But as for woody flavors I'm not detecting a whole lot. There's some spiciness though. This beer is really an Imperial Brown Ale, which makes it pretty darn close to an imperial stout, though I guess not as roasty or bitter.

T- Once again very good, great job of hiding the 12% ABV within this very drinkable brew. The flavor of the palo santo is something i have nerver experianced before.

Tan foam that recedes slowly, and leaves a ring. Lactic aroma with some banana ester from the yeast, and slightly roasty. Reminds me of a Bells stout. Rich, creamy feel, earthy roast and lactic taste. Not getting much of the advertised wood-aging. Abv is well disguised. Similar to Bells Kalamazoo Stout or Double Cream.

Coffee, vanilla and cinnamon dominate. Dark flavor, yet very herbal and aromatic at the same time. The brown sugar presence is definitely there as well. Roasty and sweet.  Mouthfeel is creamy.

It has the traditional undertones of a brown ale, but is obviously much bolder and stronger - higher alcohol makes its way to the nose, followed by a complete mouthful of awe-inspiring flavors - from oak to vanilla, cherries and a bit of dark chocolate, escaping to the farthest caverns of the mouth, saturating the entire tongue.  In addition to the vanilla, I would think that the wood imparts a subtle smokiness that really helps to round out the flavors, holding it all together through the drink and then following for a number of minutes.

Head is almost non-existent - 1/4 finger of brown foam that quickly recedes into a wispy layer of bubbles on top and a thin ring around the glass. Almost no lacing, but it does have some legs.  Smells of vanilla, light roasted malt, wood, and a bit of alcohol if you sniff hard enough.  Tastes great. If I didn't know what this was I'd call it a stout rather than a brown. Roasted malt is joined by vanilla and light chocolate flavors. The wood has less of a flavor than it does a presence. The alcohol is noticeable, but not as much as it probably should be for a 12% beer.  Mouthfeel is phenomenal. It's very thick and viscous with subdued carbonation. The smoothness really sold this beer for me.  Drinkability is great. Interesting flavors glide down my gullet. I could have a few of these.

I recently enjoyed a warm goblet of this at Max's Taphouse (see my review) in Fells Point. Palo Santo is incredibly dark with a thin translucent head on top; there is a noticeable consistency in the lacing.  The nose recognizes subtle notes of bubble gum and chocolate; the palate registers an intense and complex collaboration of malts that makes for a heavy, biscuity body. Throw in a little hop and you will be scratching your head at this ""off-centered beer.""

Flavor of rich sweet malt, bitter hops initially with a sweet sweet finish. The palate weakened in the finish, which was the only real negative thing about the beer for me.

Maple syrup. Lots of Malt! Tootsie Roll. Licorice. Very thick. Dark cherry, tobacco dipped in sugar in the raw, some leather-peat middle to end.

Smell is very good. Sweet malts with that Palo Santo Wood goodness. Quality ingredients. Wow, this is a 12% ABV Brown Ale with no hints of alcohol in the nose. Hats off.

The pour... Holy crap, this stuff is darker than I first thought- pours like motor oil as the aroma fills the room. Dark, solid black with a thin head- one of the darkest brown heads I've yet seen on a beer. Leaves a nice lacing down the glass that dissipates over time. First smell, so many different notes that I have to take multiple sniffs. Aroma is of roasted coffee, vanilla beans, ginger, lots of wood, nuts. With a scent like this I can't wait to taste it. First sip... very malty, a bit sour, lots of brown ale taste and some toastiness of a porter in there as well. Sweet notes, and a lot of spicy ground pepper feel on the finish that leaves the mouth a bit tingly. This is a fantastic experience. Going in depth with the flavors... Lots of sweet ginger, toasted woody malt, roasted coffee, chocolate, some hop bitterness there as well as I get acquainted with this beer... Fruit notes- plum, raisin, other dark fruits that I can't quite put my finger on. There is so much to talk about, this is by far the most complex beer I've ever had. The kicker for me is the spicy finish along with the severe alcohol warming effect without any semblence of an alcohol bite whatsoever even at 13% ABV. This is a superb, perfectly made beer.

The aroma was of coffee, slight chocolate, a woody earthiness, and very strong alcohol. The more I drink DFH beers, the more I realize I have a problem with them when they go above 9% ABV. To me and the other person I split the 4 pack with, the booze was not hidden very well. The mouthfeel was nice and thick. Drinkability for me, was low.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,drseamus,4.03,"A: Great looking beer. Pours dark from the bottle and forms a nice head on the surface. No light penetrates.  S: Good strong sweet aroma. Wood notes on the nose but not the typical vanilla oak everyone is accustomed to. The sweetness is 'thick' somehow, or that's how my brain perceives it.  T: The flavor is very round. Good malty sweetness throughout, but far from cloying. Some fruitiness. It ends pretty dry and there is a good bitterness at the end.  M: Thick and viscous. Barely any carbonation. Very smooth throughout.  D: Sessionability at 12% ABV is questionable, but this is still a good beer. When I had this on tap at the 2007 Extreme Beer Fest, my girlfriend and I both felt this beer won the night. In the bottle and mass produced though, it seems to have fallen a bit.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,TheMistler,3.85,"Whoah... the remnants of the bottle beaded up and skitted along the top of what was in the glass. I have never seen that before and it fascinates me to a preternatural degree.  Anywho, this poured oily thick, like a heavy imperial stout. Completely opaque, black / brown. Not much head, tan and creamy. Some whispiness on top and slight ring. Lacing is spotty and looks like drapery.  Sweet but pepper nose - definite alcohol spice. Molasses and chocolate.  Whew - the alcohol is noticeable, with a lot of warming and spice, to the point where it becomes slightly astringent, but not unpleasant. Raisins, caramel and chocolate. Wood notes, tannins. Not much bittering, but there is a moderate drying sensation, leaving some dark chocolate on the palate. Finish pretty clean, though.  Creamy in feel, with a very solid but surprisingly light body. Light to moderate carbonation kicks in a slightly sharp bite to accompany the spice.  Very tasty, but definitely a one bottle sipper.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,JoshuaCain,4.05,"poured into a conical pint. nearly black appearance with a faint brownish head, which dissipated quickly but not completely. smells of malt and earth, alcohol comes through even at cooler temperature, nearly overwhelms once its warmed. taste is big on sweet malt, followed by wood and stone fruit. mouthfeel is amazing, rich and silky, if this beer was at 7 or 8% abv it could be a favorite, but the high alcohol does take away from overall drinkability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,EPICAC,4.22,"Palo Santo Marron seems thick and viscous as it is poured from the bottle to the glass. A thick, dark brown head appears on the pour, and quickly fades to an uneven coating of bubbles on the surface of the beer, and a sudsy ring. The beer itself is a very dark, opaque, brown, resembling an imperial stout. Swirling brings back the head and leaves trailers of lace on the side of the glass. Rich and malty aromas are prevalent. Most noticeable is a dark chocolate aroma over subtler notes of dry fruit, and a distinct woody aroma. On warming the roasty edge of the chocolate is mellowed, giving the overall aroma a sweeter, molasses character. Swirling brings out astringent and spicy alcoholic notes.  Sweet, chocolate malts are prevalent initially, but give way to notes of molasses and dry fruit in the center with a hint of alcoholic spice. The spiciness gains strength towards the finish, and meets a dry, woody character. Upon warming the tannic woodiness and spicy alcohol in the finish become stronger. The beer is thick and full-bodied on the palate, with a good amount of carbonation that keeps the beer from feeling to syrupy or heavy on the palate.  This one is strong, malty and high alcohol; it's definitely a sipping beer, and isn't meant to be sessioned. Overall I found it very enjoyable. The Palo Santo gave the beer a woodiness that was distinct from other barrel aged beers that I've had before. If you can get your hands on a bottle give it a try. I'll probably pick up a couple more bottles to see how this one does in the cellar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,jpiper,3.98,"Super dark brown with a dirty tan head which quickly turns into a thin lace.  Smelled of roasted malt, with hints of chocolate, vanilla.  Flavor was the same as smell, but with tannins and quite a bit of vanilla. Pretty complex but balanced and integrated. Very nice bitterness to carry through with the not too sweet malts. A little to boozy.  Silky smooth and very thick. Very nice.  This was very much a sipper. Alcohol is somewhat hidden, but you know it's there. Too chewy for anything approaching a session beer.  This was very complex and tasty. It might benefit ffrom 12 months in the cellar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,djwilson,4.13,"Poured a very dark brown, the color of dark chocolate. The head disappeared very quickly leaving no head almost instantly. The smell is coffee, caramel, chocolate, slight wood and alcohol. The flavor was very heavy coffee upfront, with hints of brown sugar, finishing with light smoke and oak. Mouthfeel is full bodied with out being to gummy. With the high alcohol content of this beer, drinkability in my mind is maybe one snifter at a session.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

This brew pours up very dark brown with a small chocolate colored head that disappeared in a matter of seconds. the nose is big malts, subtle chocolate, spices, some alcohol spice, wood. Wow. A very different beer.... I taste earth, wood, lots of spice, malts, very dry, full bodied, medium to heavy spritzy carbo. Not a bad beer. Just different...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,gonzo46and2,5,Got this bottle at Dunderbaks in the University Mall in Tampa.  Pours a deep and dark black with no light permeating whatsoever. A dark mahogany head sits atop like a thin crown.  The smell is loaded with malt and wood. There's mostly chocolate and molasses.  Taste is very sweet and chocolaty  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy.  Drinkability is very high. This tasted great and went down very smooth.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,DrJay,4.05,"This beer arrived at my table with a thin brown collar and a skim of fine bubbles coating the top. It was very dark brown with faint edges and put a lot of fine lacing on the glass. The aroma was quite fruity, lots of fig and prune with a bit of red wine, roasted malt, chocolate and toffee, plus a bit of vanilla. Sturdy bitterness yet still balanced towards sweetness with lots of dried fruit and toffee throughout. Quite rich overall. Nicely integrated wood and tannin character. It finished with dark chocolate and alcohol. Full bodied, a bit heavy, with lowish carbonation and mild warmth. Very smooth with fine bubbles giving it a pleasant texture. Pretty tasty stuff and I'd have never guess the abv based solely on the beer in my glass. Knowing DFH, this shouldn't have been a surprise.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,ccrida,2.56,"12 oz bottle bottled on 5/28/08, almost exactly 6 months old. Poured into my Delirium snifter, Palo Santo Marron is a dark blackish brown with a very creamy tan head that leaves sheets of foamy lace.  Smell is intense, boozy and sweet, with lots of vanilla. The alcohol vapors actually singe the nostrils, but there's a bit more complexity here then the taste. Unfortunately, letting it warm from cellar to room temp sharpened the vapors to the point of overwhelming.  Taste is intense, bitter sweet. Mostly caramel malt, plasticy phenols and fusel alcohol, a light charit reminds me of a massive bourbon barrel porter, but is to hot right now to really pick up much subtlety. Not sure how long this was on the shelves when I picked it up in Boston, but I clearly should have sat on it longer then 4 months!  Mouthfeel is pretty carbonated, which helps cut the viscosity on a fairly heavy beer, but it's also incredibly tannic, which coupled with the drying burn of the booze, is very aggressive, lingering on the tongue forever.  Drinkability is hurt by the overt booziness and lack of nuance. This was painful for me to finish even a 12 oz bottle, by the last 1/2 it was really burning me up, I could feel it from the tip of my tongue to the bottom of my belly. I'm sure tomorrow morning will be real fun! Maybe I'll get one or two for long term cellar, just to see if it softens up enough after 2-3 years, but I'm unimpressed enough that I'm in no hurry to do so.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,magictrokini,3.9,"Tap @ O'Brien's. Pours black with red highlights. No head. Aroma of chocolate, vanilla, wood, and earth. Flat mouthfeel. More wood and earth in the flavor, but a very nice malt backbone, carob, and some smoke make this very pleasant. Definitely a sipper.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Brewlore,4.17,"Poured a dark brown with a faint hint of red hue glimmering through. Once it's in the glass it's quite dark and it had formed a nice light brown colored head.  The scent is full. Some dark fruit, alcohol and oaky aromas come through. It's a unique smell for sure, there's so much going on it's hard to pinpoint the style of beer you're imbibing. There's a sort of, I don't know, sour/tangy type scent arising as well.  Huge flavor out of this one. Tastes like a bourbon barrel aged brew, despite not really being one. Big sweet malt with a good hop bitterness. A taste of caramel makes itself noticed. Big on fruity esters.  Mouthfeel is smooth with a lively carb. Medium-full body that goes down easily.  12% and it's fairly easy to drink. So be careful. A great twist on the American Brown Ale style. There's a lot going on in this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,chrisafari,3.62,"Aroma: Molasses, roasted malt with slight hint of alcohol.  Pours: Dark opaque brown with 2 inch thick brown head!  Flavor: begins with roasty nutty malt. Finishes with carmel molasses and a dry throat. The dryness seems to come from the hops, slight alcohol burn. Slightly salty aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: medium-medium heavy body. Nice lacing developing.  Drinkability: medium-medium high. Not a gulper, but a sipper. Pretty easy to drink, though, for a beer @ 12% ABV.  Overall: pretty interesting and unique, but drifts almost into the realm of imperial Stouts. Not as unique as I was expecting, and is pretty off style for an American Brown Ale (although that is to be expected from DFH).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,khiasmus,4.77,"Wow. Was this a surprise. Opened this thing up as an ""eh, well I guess I'll try this tonight, I've heard it's decent..."" Boy was I wrong. I would have waited and shared this gem had I known it is this excellent.  Obviously, at 12%, it's not an American Brown Ale. There simply isn't a category for it. The closest I can think of is American strong ale, Old ale, or Imperial porter.  Pours black. The finger of tan head drops to a ring quickly, and leaves the beer looking like used motor oil. You can see your reflection in it. There are some wisps of bubbles that fight their way to the top along the sides, but few actually let go of the bottom of the glass to venture on the treacherous journey through the utter darkness.  Then the aroma... what is this? An old ale? A 4 year old RIS? A bourbon barrel aged Imperial porter? The aroma of oak, a dense, smoky aroma, is prominent in the nose. Hints of sherry, oxidization, sweet malt, the obligatory soy sauce, roses, warm alcohol... Reminds me, honestly, of a 3 year old Youngblood's Imperial Porter from Dogwood, mixed with an Old Engine Oil Special reserve. If you've had the pleasure of either, you have an inkling what this smells like. If not... For goodness sake, get your hands on this immediately.  The flavor is no slouch either. All the notes from the nose, along with some smoked gouda, molasses, raisin, and tons of warm, port-like alcohol in the finish. As it opens up, the smokiness becomes more prominent, as does the alcohol. A faint realization of earthy hops lies somewhere there in the background, hidden by the massive alcohol, sherry, and wood.  Mouthfeel is chewy, thick and syrupy, with little carbonation, further accenting how massive this beer is. The finish is just like a sherry. Very warming, smooth alcohol that lingers in the back of the throat.  Many of these ratings started off lower, but as I picked apart the aspects of this beer, I realized that I could not in good conscience rate some of them less than perfect. This beer surprised and amazed me very much. I highly recommend it to everyone. Get your hands on this crazy thing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,steelerguy,3.9,"A - This is an American Brown? If someone had just poured this for me and asked me to guess, I would have said Robust Porter. Didn't think it was to style, but attractive none-the-less.  S - Smelled like freshly baked banana bread to me that perhaps had some brandy poured on it, could definitely smell the alcohol. A very unique and good smell.  T - This is one unique beer, and I mean that in a good way. On taste, it was almost like a good Imperial Stout with dark fruit flavors most notably prune/raisin. There is also some black licorice flavor. You will notice the alcohol because it is there in abundance.  M - Black licorice flavor...syrupy mouth feel...am I drink Jager? No! I have to admit, the thought did cross my mind though. Good mouthfeel and really fits this unique beer.  D - I would almost classify this as a dessert beer. Sweet, a lot of complex fruit flavors, perfect after a nice hearty meal. I would not drink more than one at a sitting.  This is simply one of the most unique beers I have ever consumed. I'm honestly still not sure if I think it is really good or merely above average. I am going to give it the benefit of the doubt for now simply because it is so unique and I think must be tried by beer lovers.

T: Slight amounts of chocolate, vanilla, and roast with the majority of the flavor being a woodsy taste with some warming from the high alcohol.  M: Super creamy, despite what looks like a lot of carbonation.  D: Pretty drinkable despite the high alcohol content, but it's a heavy beer and I don't think I could drink more than a couple/few.

10099,33832,rustrose,4.5,"A truly unique and incredible brew well worth seeking out. Thanks Sam and Co!  Pours in a thick brown stream to form a black body with a short red-brown head, quickly dwindling to ghost-faint ring of lace. Very fine bubbles, and very thick, oily legs on the swirl. Faint ruby highlights at the bottom of my New Belgium globe glass when held to light, but generally opaque.  Around 45 degrees when I started. Big, complex nose with a blend of Mexican spiced chocolate, dark caramel, booze, pear and prune fruitiness, a vinous tang, and very faint notes of vanilla blending in with the caramel. Also picked up notes of toasted nut, and resinous incense. The wood is apparent but hard to describe--a spicy sweet earthy aroma, not really similar to oak--much less vanilla, and more cedar-like.  Tastes of spiced hot cocoa, rich caramel, French toast with molasses, and a light char/smoky flavor, with a long aftertaste of deeply toasted pie crust, cocoa, and wet fragrant board. Really unique, strange, indescribable fragrant resiny/cedary wood on the first couple sips. Deeper, sweeter, and earthier than the typical oak vanilla. Sometimes the wood/spice elements combine to remind me of cinnamon stick. Lots of alcohol warmth. Sweet, but not at all cloying. Date/fig and prune fruit notes apparent. Sometimes reminds me of a pipe when the flame goes out: wood and tobacco. Really an amazing feat of complexity with nothing unpleasant about it. Hardly comparable to a brown ale, in fact, more porter-like, but at 12% this ain't gonna taste like Newcastle. Really deserves its own category.  Mouthfeel: thick, creamy, and chewy. Very nice. Low-medium carbonation. A little hot from the alcohol. Coats the mouth and leaves a resinous feel on the lips almost like chapstick.  Drinkability: No problem putting this one down, but slowly, savoring each sip. No need to ask for another! This is a singular treat.  Overall, really a thing of beauty, rich in complexity, and a very rewarding sipper that changes as you go without being overpowering. Perfect for some pensive, rainy-day contemplation. Very easy drinking, and I'm sad to see it dwindling. Don't need two of them. The alcohol is still a bit too present and I suspect this will benefit a lot from aging, though I worry about losing the wood flavor.

10099,33832,joeskirkie,3.9,"While pouring it was viscous and oily. It gives the appearance of a stout: near black and viscous.  Scents of caramel, coffee, and alcohol, I thought immediately of Kahlua  Taste is woody and spicy to start, spicy throughout in fact. It finishes sweet with some cherry notes. About halfway through I get the warming sensations of alcohol.  As noted from the pour this beer is rather heavy. It definitely leans more towards a stout than a brown ale.

10099,33832,SerieDNo3,3.98,"Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into an imperial pint glass, and drunk with a belated Thanksgiving dinner with my family.  Appearance: This is the darkest brown ale I've ever seen. It poured like motor oil, looking more like a RIS. Low carbonation and a very thin head that disappeared rapidly. Opaque, and a beautiful deep brown, approaching blackness.  Smell: Heavy on the alcohol...people could smell it from across the table. Not unpleasant, but definitely a powerful alcohol aroma.  Taste: Very woody, oaky. Despite the heavy alcohol aroma, it hides the alcohol presence very well. A very rich beer.  Mouthfeel: Thick and chewy, with almost no carbonation.  Drinkability: Low at first, but it improved as the beer warmed up. This was a great beer to pair with turkey and stuffing, and most definitely a sipping beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,MCDuhamel,4.62,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass at cellar temperature.  A: Pours black and completely opaque. Head forms like the crema on a well-pulled shot of espresso, and then collapses to a half-inc dark tan cap. Moderate lacing. Some bubbles form at the bottom of the glass and hang out there.  S: The nose presents wood, some vanilla, and lots of roasted malt. It is simultaneously sweet and slightly spicy. Some raisin or prune is detectable as well.  T: The wood is very forward on the palate, lending a pronounced spiciness leading to a smooth vanilla note. The malt is quite upfront too, emerging out of the wood after the first few seconds. The finish is of dried fruit.  M: Fairly heavy mouthfeel, with a bit more carbonation than I was expecting.  D: Given the pronounced wood character and very high alcohol content, this is surprisingly--and dangerously--drinkable, although it is definitely a beer to nurse over a time rather than to quaff.  Overall: Really unlike anything else. I gave it a half point for originality.

Full body, medium carbonation there is a creamy mouthcoating feel with a chalky, dry finish.

Some earthy spiciness, and an elegant wood aroma.  Tastes excellent, rich, and smooth. Similar characteristics to an oak aged ale, but a bit sweeter and earthier.

The small amount of head is a medium tan color, and a good amount of lacing sticks to the sides of the glass after each sip. S- A very sweet smell. Sweet, ripe dark fruits, some coffee, caramel, and booze. T- I'm not sure where to start with this one, and I'm certain that I'm not qualified to begin dissecting the flavors in this extremely complex beer. Obviously the backbone of the flavor is sweet caramel and roasted malts. There is also dark fruit and coffee which follow from the aroma. This is the first wood-aged beer that I've had where I've really been able to pick out exactly the flavor given to the beer by the wood. While I don't want to see this beer tastes ""woody"", I can definitely pinpoint a unique woody taste in it. M- Thick, creamy, full bodied, wonderful.

10099,33832,Damian,4.7,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Julio's Liquors, Westboro, MA Bottled on 02/11/08 Served in a snifter  The beer poured a deep, dark brown/black with a tight, frothy, bubbly, coffee-colored head that eventually faded to a thick ring of lace. Blankets of lacing cascaded down the glass.  The aroma was super dark, malty and robust. Chocolatey and smooth. Semi-sweet with notes of brown sugar and vanilla. Slightly boozy (bourbony). As the beer warmed, the aroma intensified and became sweeter. The vanilla notes became much more apparent as well.  The taste was very similar to the aroma. Intensely rich, dark and robust. A nice mix of roasted and caramel malts. Oaky and woody. Bourbon came through strong. Semi-sweet with vanilla notes. Boozy mid-palate. Dark fruit notes (including cherries) were also apparent. A touch of alcohol warmth appeared in the finish.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied. Silky, frothy and creamy with a fine, mild carbonation.  This beer was ridiculously smooth and drinkable for 12% ABV. Had I not known any better, I would have guessed it to be in the 7-9% range.  Palo Santo Maron is truly an outstanding brew. It is definitely a ""must try"" if you are a fan of sweeter and/or woody/oaky extreme-style beers. Dare I say this is Dogfish Head's most impressive release to date?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Head is deep tan, beer is opaque brown. like mud. smell is alcohol, wood, brown sugar. Taste is strong alcohol, sugar, wood. The whole thing is very sugar/lignin centric. (duh). It's way to heavy though. The 12% is really too much. As an american brown it's got a good flavor, but this is more of a shot or a 7 oz beer than a 12 oz.  I look forward to the next offering from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,dancinwillie,4.47,"Pouring this, it looked like a dark red, akin to cranberry juice. Once in the glass however, it is dark, I repeat, it is DARK brown. No light gets through. Topped by a creamy looking, dark khaki head.  Smells like cherry and wood. Something in this scent makes me nostalgic, reminds me of some long forgotten part of my childhood, and that makes me happy. My mouth is really watering in anticipation now!  A sweet fruitiness is the first thing I notice. Not overpowering, or cloying, just sweet. Cherry is my initial thought, but perhaps cranberry isn't far off either. A bit of an alcohol bite presents itself, but not unpleasantly, just kind of lets you know not to take it lightly. The wood flavor is pretty strong as well. Hell if I know what Paraguayan Palo Santo wood should taste like, but I do know what it does taste like. Deliciousness. This is the flavor that brought on the nostalgia in the aroma. I'm not picking up any hop flavor, but I'm guessing it's well hopped, as this seems like it would be really sweet, if hops weren't there to do the balancing. Definitely the best Brown Ale I've ever had the pleasure of tasting.  Full bodied beauty. 'Nuff said.  The only thing keeping the drinkability down for me is the ABV. That being said, ""drinkability"" could mean how often would I drink this beer, as opposed to how many would I drink in a single session. The latter would be low, maybe 1 or 2. But as to how often, well, just as often as I can, so I'm going to rate this a bit higher than I normally would. Semantics maybe, but I'm very impressed by this beer. I have never found a Brown Ale I even kind of liked until today. This is just an amazing beer. I'm going to cellar some, and try to knock of some of that alcohol bite, and enjoy this for a long time.

Caramel and vanilla are present as well, as promised by the label, though the vanilla is a lot more noticeable than the caramel to me. Mouth is smooth and full bodied. This is easy to drink, but I think this hits a niche for me that others might not like as much. The alcohol is too high for a session beer though, unless you don't need to be able to walk.

10099,33832,Kendo,4.34,"A: Poured into my Spirit Haus pint glass. Body is nearly black with shimmers of ruby at the base of the glass. A half-finger, foamy, chocolate-brown head bubbles noisily and settles quickly. No lace.  S: Fifteen to eighteen inches from the glass and I get a strong whiff. Booze, dried fruit (raisins, prunes), port wine, vanilla, and roasted or even smoked malt. Interesting. Like a Brown Ale? Not really. A Brown Ale on steroids, maybe, but I'm thinking more of a cross between an Imperial Porter, a Brown and a hint of Scottish Ale, with a shot of RIS thrown in.  T: There's a lot going on and it melds fairly nicely. Dark dried fruits. Roasted malt. Chocolate. Hint of vanilla. Molasses. Rum-soaked raisins. Even a touch of nuttiness. Hint of astringent wood towards the back of the sip, but I expected more of a woodsy taste, to be honest (and I'm glad it didn't overwhelm the rest of the flavors, to be honest). That, combined with the alcohol, seems to give some counterbalance to the otherwise sweet flavors. Raw heat from the ABV makes its presence known on the way down.  M: Despite the presumably ABV-destroyed head, there is active carbonation here. It prickles the tongue nicely and makes it feel a bit creamy and lighter in feel than you'd expect from all those heavy flavors. Still heavy-bodied, however.  D: Good. A sipper, no doubt, but enjoyable.  Notes: To be honest, there was a time when I thought DFH was absolutely awesome. I still love their 60 and 90 minute IPAs and their Indian Brown Ale, but their experimental stuff I've had in recent years didn't do it for me. This I like, however. I've accidentally aged their Indian Brown Ale and in some ways this reminds me of the result of that -- port-like with dark and dried fruits. But this has even more going on, all in a 12% ale.

To me the nose is initially all roasted malts and charred wood.The wood aromas hit you as you pour it. Putting your nose to the snifter you pick u whiffs of vanilla, molasses, berries, raisins and toffee. Beautiful bouquet of smells for sure.  Mouthfeel is creamy and velvety. Low carbonation keeps it silky smooth and round.  Flavor profile is of course sweet but never cloying. Tastes of dark malts, burnt caramels, vanilla cream, dark fruits, vanilla and charred oak come to the forefront.

Head disappears pretty quickly, and only leaves a little bit of stick and a rimjob in the lace department.  Smells of rich, sweet malts and some roasted aromas. I get some chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt, some earthy and nutty aromas, and every now and again a whiff of vanilla and oak.  Taste seems quite a bit different than the smell, as the first blast of flavor is very fruity, with some cherry and dark fruits really exploding on the palate. A hint of red wine sort of flavor is evident now and again, too. Going back to smell again I can pick up a bit of fruit now that I'm looking for it, but nothing along these lines. Sweet, sort of candied fruity flavor follows, with some caramel malt sweetness and some roasted malt, and then a nice oak and vanilla flavor that is also stronger than the smell was. There is some alcohol evident here but overall it's hidden quite well for 12%. This is amazingly complex for a brown ale, and is really tasty.  Mouthfeel is nearly full bodied, quite creamy and smooth. Carbonation is soft enough to allow this to be savored in the mouth.

I'm just going to stop reviewing this strictly as a brown ale right now and base my rating of this mostly on my enjoyment of this brew. The aroma is complex, unique and wonderful. A deep, perfumey alcohol character is what I detect first but vanilla and an assortment of spices are very prominent. There is also a distinct caramel sweetness and a heavy dose of vinous fruits. There is also a very unique character that I assume must come from the time spent in the Palo Santo wood vessels. Taste is fairly sweet. Healthy doses of caramel and molasses that dominate throughout are complimented by a more moderate vinous character and relatively restrained spice flavors. Theres lots of booze in the taste too. It's not overwhelming but is noticeable and an important flavor component. Very full bodied, slightly syrupy, quite sweet. Carbonation is moderate and alcohol presence is strong and warming. Drinkability is a bit above average. I don't really know that I need a whole 12 oz.of this brew. That being said this beer was still incredibly complex and enjoyable.

Rich, wood aged taste. Malts, vanilla rum and toffee notes. I can't pick up any hops. The taste comes off more as a rich, bourbon-barrel aged porter or even a barely-win.

There are some dark chocolate and molasses notes here, and all in all the scents blend together nicely.  Taste: This beer has a strong alcohol bite with a sweet taste beneath it.

Aftertaste is bittersweet with a coffee undertone.  Drinkability: I didn't like this beer as much as a lot of people seem too, but it wasn't bad.

A: For a brown ale this beer is awful black. Black I tell you. Thick and oily. Black. Did I mention black. The only thing brown about this beer is the coffee colored finger of head I got off the gently pour. Although it is listed as a brown ale, the bottle says malt beverage, and this does look like some nice dark malts. Lacing is a bit weak, leaving a thin sheet on the glass. This looks nice and tasty.  S: Smell is of beautifully roasted malt over a sweet, smoky wood. So much malt in the nose. Not too dynamic, there is a bit of spice in there but I can't place it. The nose is malt. Nuff said, thats it. Oh yeah, there is booze there too.  T: Taste is once again of a heavily roasted malt flavor. The wood is there but it is not overpowering. Just adds a smooth smokiness to the brew and adds a bit of sweetness. Caramel and brown sugar are lingering in there. Also nutmeg and cinnamon. There is also a really nice milk chocolate presence on the finish. Booze is there in the aftertaste but once again not too crazy, especially for the ABV level.  M: This bitch is thick. Oil slick thick. So sticky from the malt that it really coats the mouth. Carbonation is actually present and noticable that allows this to go down a bit easier than you would think. Booze has a slight burn on the throat, but not bad.  D: This beer is good but it is really thick and high on the ABV. It doesn't go down to easy and you really want to sip this sucka.

The finish is a long clean hops signature that refuses to fade out. The mouthfeel was reminicent of a light cream with the flavor blooming and no sharp edges. The only attribute I down-rate is the drinkability-- it seems like all DFH beers the alcohol content is higher than average. If it doesn't make itself known after the first bottle, it will certainly be there after the second. Nevertheless, I plan to revisit the Palo Santo Marron experience without hesitation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

The aroma is of coffee,toffee,weird oaky kind of smell. Nice legs like a port. This had a rich flavor. The best brown ale ive ever had. It is sweet with a strong malt bitterness. A slight presence of alcohol but it gets better as it warms. Sweet and syrupy on the mouthfeel. good drinkability, id want to sit around a fire drinking this beer all night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,Pleepleus,3.3,"Thanks to Moxley for this one. Poured from bottle to pint glass black with reddish hues and a minimal ruby cream head that diminished quickly with no lacing. Smelled of berries, red wine and alcohol. Taste was a strong alcohol and berry with a sweet tart finish. Almost like a bubbly Merlot very highly carbonated. I was glad to try this but it is not my thing. I would not have another as this is not something I could enjoy more than one of.

10099,33832,NEhophead,3.9,"12 fl oz brown bottle; served in a goblet.  Deep mahogany-maple in color that is near opaque. Carbonated, light brown head that fades to a whispy sheet rather quickly. A few traces of thin lacing.  Semi-sweet aromatics: caramelized brown sugar with a moderate dose of vanilla. Nutmeg, saffron, and cinnamon add a pleasant 'winter' spice. Hints of aged, vinous fruit with a swarming, deep alcohol character.  Strong, rich caramel and molasses that last into the finish. Licorice and saffron spices that add some heavy flavors to the already warming brown sugar and nutmeg. Speaking of warming...the alcohol character is immense, but it blends well with the rich, dessert-like flavors. The aftertaste is both spicy and sweet.  Full bodied; almost slick, given the sweetness and alcohol strength. The smooth, hefty texture coats the palate without hesitation.  A big Brown Ale with some unique flavors; namely: vanilla and licorice. While this offering is a treat, at 12% abv drinkability is somewhat compromised.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,UnionMade,3.5,"Dark, opaque brown, ringed with a collar of tan bubbles. The head is weak to begin with, and dies to nothing about halfway through. No lace sticking to the snifter. Big, sweet aroma. Tons of malty caramel, with a definite woody vanilla character. Some smoky black malt and plenty of fusel alcohol, with a bit of raisin and black cherry. The booze seems to compete with the malt quite a bit, which is distracting. The flavor opens up with sticky sweetness, in that typical dogfish big beer manner. Gobs of sugary caramel and fruits in syrup, like the fruit cups we ate when we were kids. Black cherry and plum, with heavy molasses, coffee, vanilla bean and a bit of tobacco. A touch of raisin sourness in the finish, doing its best to balance things out. No discernible hop presence. Lots of boozy heat lasting forever in the throat. I almost feel like I'm drinking a carbonated cordial. Very, very sweet overall, with a ponderous, sticky, syrupy feel. I like the mild woodiness, but I'd rather see it in something a little less intense, where it can present itself properly. Although it's a hefty 12%, it drinks like something just shy of 20%. The booze really kills this one, and the sweetness gets to be a bit much halfway through. If you're looking for something in the 12% abv range to close out an evening, I can immediately think of a half dozen that are far more easy going.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

T: The alcohol dominated the taste but the brown sugar and molasses come through. I am also tasting the entire gamut of things i mentioned in the smell, but with the addition of an oaky taste.

10099,33832,thekevlarkid,4.55,"Out of the bottle this unfiltered brown ale was a deep, dark, nearly porter colored brown that actually let no light pass through it. The head was also a woody brown, one-finger-thick cap of tight bubbles that retained well and laced in a pattern like torn curtains. The aroma was robust and rich, roasted malt, hints of wood and spices, alcohol esters, toffee and brown sugar too. Very complex on the palate as well living up to the aroma; caramel, vanilla and toffee sweetness first hit my tongue followed closely by the Palo Santo wood flavor, some alcohol heat and some hints of charcoal fading into coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Nicely balanced and impressive in new ways as it warmed up. For a beer as potent as this one was I was amazed how approachable it was. The mouthfeel was exceptionally creamy and smooth with a light carbonation of the medium to full body.

Aroma on opening sends forth a nice smoky woody note...interestingly, woodiness receded after pouring and there was really only a hint of smoke among the other layers of aromas an flavors. Roasted caramel malt, some coffee and chocolate notes, rich creamy mouthfeel. 12% ABV surprisingly drinkable. Definitely a rich beer to savor after dinner, better at warmer temp.

Very imperial stout-like in it's aromatic profile.  Appearance: Jet black pour with a moderate tan sudsy head.  Flavor: More fruity esters with a moderate toasted wood note. Background smokey notes that are blended well with the base beer's malt and hop profile. Smokey enough to be interesting but not enough to overpower everything else. Finish is clean and dry.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with moderately high carbonation. Slight dark grain astringency.  Overall impression: A big, well balanced, well crafted wood-aged ale. Too big and dark for a brown.

M,D: The mouthfeel is rather thick and carbonation is on the low side. The ABV kills the drinkability, but overall a decent beer by DFH.  ---  Cheers to BA NittanyBeerFan for sharing this one...Poured into a pint glass...

Bourbon, smoke, sugar, and a bunch of stuff that isn't easy to put in words. You can definitely taste the wood in this one. I guess it's not oak, but the Uruguayan wood used to age this.

Lots of oak and vanilla aromas along with molasses. That combination plus the alchol aroma lends itself to bourbon. Hints of chocolate and coffee to counter the sweetness. Oak, vanilla, and molasses hit first. Coffee with lots of cream and sugar flavors. Hints of dark chocolate in there too. Pretty thick mouthfeel. Almost like drinking light weight motor oil.

10099,33832,EPseja,4.39,"Leave it to the guys at Dogfish Head to take an otherwise ordinary and oft overlooked beer style and amp it up to the point where it teeters on the brink of falling off the edge of the style boundaries.  Served from a 12oz. bottle in a SABL glass at cellar temperature.  A - Deep, deep chestnut brown with a cocoa colored head that acts bold at first, then quickly subsides to an opaque mat. Big, strutting legs like a nice, think tawny port. Lacing is marginal at best, and head retention is standard. Anyone not knowing better might think they're in for another nondescript brew.  S - Oak and vanilla - reminds me a bit of the nose on a Sam Adams Triple Bock in some ways. Perhaps some Maple sugariness. Underlying, subtle tones of salted licorice. An very interesting nose for a brown.  T - Earthy, vanillin sweetness with the presence of a dark molasses. Alcohol is present, but only smolders without burning. Vinous and strong-willed like a good pinot noir, but not as spicy, and with a black cherry character. Drying in the finish without leaving you parched. Aftertaste like acacia... or something similar. Amazing complexity, and a handful of other taste notes upon which I can't quite put my finger.  M - Thick and slick - reaching for and finding every crevice in your mouth. Lightly tingly on the tongue, and swelling like a cresting ocean wave. Swallows like a thick cafe con leche. Excellent.  D - At this ABV, I switch from my ""would I have another?"" mode to my ""how long am I going to want to milk this beer for so it doesn't go away?"" mode. The answer? All night long. It's 9:00 PM, and I don't think I want to take my last sip until about 11:00 PM.

The head is ¾ of an inch with a burnt caramel coloring. Strong retention. Lacing clouds the glass with tiny and tightly bounded bubbles.  S: Aroma is initially strong of toasted cocoa and charred coffee. Hints of vanilla, dark fruits, and burnt wood are all there. A strong bitter chocolate smell with warming cinnamon and slight hop nods. The nose is insanely good and infinite in aromas.  T: This flavor is surprisingly mild for the ABV yet still rich and complex. The woody and nutty qualities are in the forefront. Roasted chocolate, whiskey soaked prunes, and oaked vanilla. Warm spices and dark fruits soaked in brandy. The finish is of caramel scorched raisins and bitter dark figs. Overall the malts coupled with the bitterness help hide the potency.  M: This is massive, thick, and creamy. Low carbonation that will warm you up in a matter of seconds.  D: Had this a few times prior to trying it again for this review.

Upfront, the taste of raisins, molasses, and slight alcohol is apparent.  M - surprisingly carbonated (!)  D - though a sipper, this brew is very drinkable. It's unlike any beer I've had so I had some difficulty articulating the nuances. I'm still working on it as we speak; from beginning to end, it will probably be an hour or so drinking.

Aroma is rich and creamy with a hint of raisin, brown sugar and some alcohol warmth on the nose. Definitely has some roasty character as well.

Some woodiness is in the flavor as well.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with alcohol warmth, woodiness and raisin/caramel flavors. Very interesting.  Drinkability is pretty high for this one.

S: Same unique aromas as you find in the bottle but they are a more forward. Bold roasted malt leads the way followed by a big blast of dark fruit. Hints of chocolate come next along with molasses and brown sugar.  T: The base beer is no doubt a solid brown ale. The molasses really comes out in the taste along with a bit of caramel. Leather and chocolate come next only to be overcome by a bit of smoke and earth.  M: Medium in body with nice carbonation.

Looks more like a great porter than anything. Nose of fermented cherries and dark fruit, sweet malts, hints of chocolate, and boozy alcohol. Smoky notes of charred aromatic wood. Tastes a bit more subdued than the nose advertises with a mellow malty-chocolate flavor with mingled dark fruit rising to a warm alcohol glow toward the back and finishing on dry, powdery chocolate bitter note. Somewhat earthy. On the palate it's rich and syrupy smooth with very light carbonation just enough to keep things interesting. Drinkability is very good: this is one smooth and sleek brew. 12% alcohol definitely demands respect, however.

10099,33832,JMH_,3.86,"Pours a thick, damn near black colour that essentially looks like engine oil coming out of the bottle. Liquid settles into the glass with a very nice, hefty and creamy tan head atop it. Small areas of residue are left on the sides of the glass. This beer really looks awesome overall.  The aroma is also quite nice: cocoa powder and alcohol lead the way and blend with some dark fruit and hints of wood. Perhaps some general burnt/roasted malt as well.  Flavour is quite similar to the aroma: cocoa leads, although it is a bit subdued from the aroma, as is the alcohol, which is present but far less aggressive here. The wood notes certainly stand out a bit more, as does the harshness of darker fruit/raisin notes. There's an earthiness to the flavour as well that just sits right overall. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of slickness and a whole lot of hottness to it, perhaps too much hotness at times. I know this is a ""big"" beer, but I'd have tried to tone it down a touch.  I liked this one. It's certainly a twist on the traditional brown ale, and a nice one at that. Would I drink it often? No, but I'd definitely revisit it and gladly drink it again.

The taste is pretty good. Plenty of coffee and chocolate with some subdued sweet fruit. A little floral and boozy. Definitely feel the heat on the finish. This is more stout like than Brown Ale, but DFH doesn't really seem to care for style guidelines.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick, and lightly carbonated producing more of a still feel.  Drinkability is moderate. Flavors are fine, and although the alcohol is high and apparent, it seems fitting. Not awesome, but not bad either. I dig it.

The first whiff is of a roasted porter. Heavy burst of alcohol singes the nostrils. The oak so heavily advertisted on the label is actually nicely subdued. Any vanilla in the nose is strictly theoretical.  The taste is a heavy blast of alcohol, with some serious oak. This all overshadows the second wave of the burnt porter malt in the aftertaste. As it warms, the caramel and vanilla come out like a nice iced coffee. Toward the end, some raisin and dark tobacco.  The feel thick and chewy -- and outstanding. It's a burn at first, and then a cooldown. I'll tell ya, this is one challenging beer.

10099,33832,GClarkage,4.2,"09/16/08- Purchased at City Beer in San Francisco, CA.  Presentation- 12oz bottle with no freshness info on the label or bottle. Poured into my Duvel tulip.  Appearance- Very syrupy looking deep brown cola colored pour. Starts out with a 1/2 inch head which quickly turns to a light rim. Very light spotty lace remains.  Smell- Deep roasted oaky scented malt with some chocolate undertones and some light hints of vanilla. Not assertive enough for the abv.  Taste- The abv sneaks up late in this beer. At first there is no way this can be 12% you are thinking, but as you consume more, the beer gets thicker. Seems a just a touch watery in the beginning, but quickly rounds out very nicely with sugary vanilla oak flavored malt, light hop oil taste and some creamy cocca powder flavor.

10099,33832,tempest,4.12,"Picked up a single at Bocktown Beer in Pittsburgh back in April. Poured into a wide-mouth glass is nearly black with a short tan head that doesn't hang around.  The aroma is full of molasses with a bit of dark chocolate. he flavor has more of the chocolate (reminds me of 65% cocoa) and wood, I guess I can't call it oak, but its kind of like oak but earthier. There's also a little fig and allspice, clove, and pepper. The body is medium thickness, relatively light for a 12% brew, and pretty drinkable, albeit a sipper.

10099,33832,BWMKappaSig,4.45,"12 oz bottle served in snifter.  Appearance: Viscous black liquid with a finger thick, velvet-like, deep tan head. Held up to the light, the beer shows the vaguest hint of mahogany.  Smell: Roasted, sweet and almost chocolatey malt. There are slight hints of a blended whiskey smell within the beer.  Taste: Excellent taste. Slightly bitter roasted malts, hints of caramel, a little bit of alcohol. This brown ale really rivals the best imperial porters for taste and fullness.  Mouthfeel: Absolutely incredible mouthfeel. Rich, creamy, and smooth. The alcohol is present, but not hot. A slight warming note to the alcohol comes through as it opens up, but the feel is close to perfection.  Drinkability: Entirely doesn't show its 12% despite its monster status.

10099,33832,Foxman,4.15,"It pours an unexpectedly deep mahogany, or perhaps ebony with ruby slivers, but either way, it's darker than I anticipated. Two fingers of speckled tannish brown head sink slowly. Spikes of lacing lance the inside of the glass.  The aroma is dense and rich with roasted malt, toffee, brown sugar, and molasses. Not to mention dates, caramel, and mildly smoky but notably resinous wood. The alcohol is a tacit twist.  Upon sipping, a wash of roasted malt swarms with sweet brown sugar, dried fruit, and earthy dark molasses. It's the woody character that dominates, though, with a mildly smoky nature that speaks of lightly charred bark. The alcohol pushes hard here and sets up the ensuing progression from burnt biscuit to a very dry, distant spiciness that lingers long in the finish. It's bold, and yet graced with various subtleties as well.  Damned near full bodied, it starts cloying and syrupy but it thins a bit as it flows and finally dries.  True to its name, there's no question this is all about the wood it's aged in. At points, it's almost as though I was chewing on aromatic twigs, and that's in no way a bad thing, at least not in this instance. The ABV and sweetness present a bold face combined, but the uniqueness helps it to flow ably.

Aromas are all sweet sugary alcohol and sweet candy coated malts. Faint green hop oils are in the back of it all. Taste is sugary candy syrup sweet and extremely one dimensional. Not bad but not impressive. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit cloying with all of the sweetness. It makes me weant to scrape my tongue.

10099,33832,JayQue,4.25,"This ain't your father's Brown Ale!!!! Sort of an Imperial Stout in disguise. Dense black color, big tan head, strong aroma of malt, dark fruit and chocolate.  Tastes like an imperial stout too, except there is a generous amount of vanilla. It cuts the alcohol taste and minimizes some of the rich stout flavors. The coffee, dark chocolate and malts are all there.  Mouthfeel is rich, but the vanilla cuts it a bit and adds a bit of crispness.  Drinkability is good but this is a sipping beer, not designed for mass quantities!!! Very tasty. I would like some more of this one",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Patrick999,4.54,"Finally....I didn't think I'd ever find this beer, but here it is. Very excited to try this, even though I'm not a huge fan of imperial stouts and related beers.  A - Poured into a snifter a crazy oily cocoa-black. Thumbnail of creamy looking root-beer type head that dissipated, though a few good swirls of the snifter brings the foam back. What a color - as I hold up to the light, I see no red, just a little brown near the top.  S - Bittersweet cocoa along with a fresh vanilla. Not dissimilar to a good imperial stout, but at once not quite the same. Carob and raisin, a very savory raisin. Like an oaked beer with the big vanilla, but somehow softer and more inviting. I guess I have to attribute that to the Palo Santo wood. It has to be the wood; there's no adjunct in here that would help explain it. Like most of the DFH big beers, really one for the snifter, a fine sniffing beer.  T - Again, similar to a very good imperial stout. You have your dark roasted coffee flavors, your chocolate, vanilla, some earthy bitter hop wrapping it all up. But it's somehow even more lush than an imperial stout. Plus, where is the crazy 12% alcohol? It's not ""hot"" at all, and this bottle isn't even that old. It tastes similar to an oaked beer, only less tannic. Not that I'm complaining about the use of oak in beer, but this is a little bit different, and a welcome change of pace.  F - Full-bodied, creamy and rich. Hey, it's 12%, and a big time malt bomb.  D - One serving in a night is all you want. Still, pretty special stuff....and take it from me - these massive dark beers aren't even really my thing. It's difficult to not be a big fan of this, though. A 4-pack will set you back some $$$, but it's worth it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Appearance: A deep purple, almost black body with a one finger tall tan with purple highlights head. Excellent retention but poor lacing. Smell: Very boozy, roasted malt, mocha and coffee. Taste: Boozy again, but not as overwhelming as the aroma. Dark fruit make it a bit winy. Mouthfeel: Silky because of a lack of body.

About ¾ of an inch of dense-looking brownish-white head developed in my Corsendonk tulip (my standard taster). Some carbonation clung to the sides of the bottom of the glass. Significant lacing after each swirl of the glass.  Smell - Sticky-sweet dried fruit and vanilla extract with more than a hint of alcohol. Slight floral hop nose. The aging adds a nice woody component to the aroma, too. Some roasty notes that reminded me of the 100% Kona coffee I had for breakfast today.  Taste - Sweet, malty goodness followed by a fruity center with a late roasty, somewhat hoppy finish of vanilla flavors. An even later lingering alcohol note appeared with some noticeable warmth going down. Very complex.  Mouthfeel - Just enough carbonation to get your mouth's attention while remaining restrained. Thick- this beer coated the palate with its smooth sweetness. The body is as close to perfect as I've ever encountered in a beer-viscous and creamy.  Drinkability- Terrific.

Nose: Soy, dark-roasted coffee beans, a whisper of smoke or heavy fresh cream. Smells almost stout-like.  Palate: Very little carbonation. Candy sugar is immediately noticeable, licorice, bitter coffee, umami (soy sauce), moss, herbal notes as if I was in an herb shop like lavender and dried teas. There's also notes of cola and dried wheat stalks. A slight fruitiness is on the finish and fights with the coffee and soy and moist wood notes. I also think of this ""Alternative smoking blend"" that I bought at an herb store that may have contained mint, sagebrush and mugwort.  Notes: This beer is uber-complex on the palate, and it feels like it's harmonious although somewhat random. All of the flavors are competing for center-stage, but it's not disjointed.

10099,33832,Rudgers73,4.1,"Poured into a white wine glass this beer is a very dark brown with a RIS type heavy, thick, dark head. I can see small hints of pretty significant carbonation. I can already smell the interesting Palo Santo wood. It has hints of vanilla and chocolate. The head begins to settle to a 1/4"" cap and the coffee aroma starts to pour out. Black patent malt, caramel, and a does of resiny hops spell the scent. The texture is incredibly thick and chewy leaving a nice lather of hop oil on your tongue after each sip. The base of this beer is big and malty with a little bit of bitterness hitting you from the patent, a little more hitting you from the hops. They taste like a strong English, or a sturdy American bittering hop. Personally I find this tough to call a Brown Ale. It has a lot of heat and too bitter a taste to leave the realm of a Baltic-type porter to me. Maybe we can call it an Imperial American Brown Ale?  I would like to lay one of these down for a couple of years and check back in after it sweetens up a touch.  Well done Sam.

10099,33832,NeroFiddled,3.93,"I picked up a bottle of the Palo Santo Marron somewhere in my travels, not knowing what it was, and not even looking at the 12% abv on the label. After a few weeks in the fridge I finally got around to it and opened it up the same , without a care. I was quite surprised (and excited) to see a rich, very brown stream pouring into my glass. Ruby highlights could been seen through the stream, but when it hit the glass it turned black. A creamy head of dark tan rose up above it. I couldn't help but take a sip before finishing the pour. It was dark, rich, and slightly fruity and slightly nutty. I checked it for clarity... well that was out, I couldn't see through it. The dark ruby highlight at the base of the glass was nice though.  On to the nose. I sniffed it, and then I sniffed it again. Definite dark malts, and some dark malt acidity, kind of like you get in black coffee - not the coffee smell, but something else that to me says acidity. Maybe I just mean a roasted edge. Fruitiness. It's kind of undefineable, but fruitiness is there... melon rind, perhaps some strawberry. There's a little bit of alcohol to it, and that sometimes suggests fruit. I had to sniff again. Some mild caramel.... but kind of almost scorched and crispy caramel. Burnt sugar I guess. A touch of vegetation.... like fresh cut sapling. Maybe the 'sap' smell was what I was picking up as 'acidic'. Chlorofil-like? Yeah, I think to a certain extent. But what about wood? Now that I know it's aged in wood, did I smell any? Yes, I think so, but just a touch. Of course maybe it's a fruity kind of wood? Maybe what I was smelling smells exactly like Palo Santo? I don't know.  In the mouth it was smooth, richly medium in body, with the silky feel of alcohol infused malt. A very fine-bubbled moderate carbonation helped it acquire a velvet creaminess.  The flavor was rich, and somewhat bold, but not really complex. It offered some moderate fruitiness, and distinct alcohol. There was no direct chocolate, but it ricocheted about here and there until some fudge actually appeared in the finish. Then there was some nuttiness, and a wash of alcohol to boot. The chocolate echoed. Deep cocoa. Real milk chocolate. But it was also fruit tinged as that never really left the palate. Nutiness, and the bitterness of brazil nut skins appeared. I hadn't really thought of the bitterness... up until that point it was just about the maltiness and fruitiness. I guess that's because the bitterness is kept restrained. There's enough alcohol available to dry it in the finish that a solid bitterness isn't needed. And such a dark beer has cutting acidity as well. So - nicely balanced overall. And the hops that are there seem to be covered over, but mainly leafy and grassy, and perhaps a touch spicy (although I think that's the alcohol making itself known).  Interesting? Yes. Enjoyable? Yes. Remarkable? No. I'd much rather have an ImmortAle or World Wide Stout for the price.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,Acochran,4.33,"Looking for something along the lines of a slow drinkable I stumbled across this gem upon the advice of the storeowner of Wine Palace in West Bridgewater, MA. It's an unfiltered brown ale that the brewers at Dogfish Head age in handmade wooden brewing vessels. Right away you notice distinct caramel and vanilla. Dogfish Head says that's partly attributable to the exotic Paraguayan Palo Santo wood that the brewing vessels are made from. The beer is as dark as they come; there's no light getting through this one. It's not burnt or heavy in any way, but rather the highly roasty and malty brew is bursting with flavor and extremely drinkable. At 12% abv you absolutely ""smell"" the heat at your nose and sense the alcohol on your tongue, but it's not overpowering by any stretch.

Alcohol is evident at first but recedes into the background of the beer later on, allowing the burnt malt and wood tastes to make themselves much more evident. A fairly balanced taste overall.  M: A pretty smooth and full-bodied mouthfeel that was pleasant on the palate.  D: A decent taste and mouthfeel combo. As you drink this beer, it becomes more drinkable. The alcohol tends ton recede, allowing the burnt malts and wood tastes to make themselves much more evident. A nice beer and worth a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,chrisny4205,4.38,"Bought this bottle at the brewpub restaraunt.  Darkest brown ale I have ever seen. Almost black. Still a nice brown head as a reminder. Like ""o yeah it is a brown ale"". The color is as dense as the wood used in fermenting this beer.  Strong smell of licorice and the wood of the back. The alcohol cuts it quickly. You could almost smell a freshly carved bar stool made out of pal santo wood but its deep a hidden.  Taste is big. Sweet malts hit first then followed by a licorice and then almost like a bourbon taste at the end. Without a doubt you can taste the wood. Its there a dancing around in the back of the taste quickly being cut by the alcohol. Tough to taste any bittering hops.  Liquid velvet rolling across the tongue. Excellent mounthfeel that takes away the drinkability. This beer is too big and strong to be knocking down. I only need two. I am happy with that.  Great beer from a great brewery. Love wood in a beer and used immensely in this beer. Palo Santo wood works good in a big sweet brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Bitterbill,4.35,"I got this bottle in a trade with nutbrown. Thanks Alan!  A near pitch black pour with the slightest of brownish hues, I got a +1 finger head of tan foam. Excellent head retention and lots of lacing.  I get a lot of wood in the nose along with some fruit. licorice, chocolate, and some caramel malt.  The taste is a malt lover's dream. Malty sweetness with some roastiness..it kind of has that Milk Stout malty flavour. Yum. Plenty of chocolate and some coffee and the woodiness adds a nice dimension without being over powering, and I get some dark fruit flavour and liquorice as well.  Mouthfeel borders on thick, carbonation is lightish, and it finishes with a nice fruity flavour that brings just the slightest amount of tartness with it. Man, and the alcohol is *very* well hidden; sure there's *some* warming after the swallow but it's minimal for such a big beer.  Bottom line: I really like this American Brown Ale as it has all sorts of good flavours going on and it's a wonderful sipper. Highly recommended!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

The wood worked superb wonders without being overbearing, and balanced not too sweet. Dark brown and rich-looking, above average mouthfeel. Very drinkable for 12%.

A - Dark brown body bordering black with burgundy highlights and burnt medium brown wispy head that settled to a thin film and left very little lacing.  S - Complex aroma with hints of baker's chocolate, confectioner's sugar, dark fruits and woody notes. There's also an earthy yeast character present. A mild soy sauce aspect developed as the liquid warmed up.  T - Flavor opens with chocolate and sweet malt and a hefty does of dark fruity esters. Woody notes begin to emerge soon thereafter with a mild earthy, yeasty character. Finishes with a mild toasted maltiness, wood and a mild alcohol presence.  M - Rich, smooth and full-bodied with lively carbonation and a warm, tingly feeling with some tongue prickle. Mild spiciness on the palate with some definite heat from the alcohol content. Chewy mouthfeel overall with some residual sticky sweetness.  D - Alcohol comes through quite a bit in this one. I'd also like a little less carbonation as well.

As it warms I get even more yeast of black cherry and ripe peaches. Very, very nice.  Deep black and nothing gets through when held up to the light. Pretty small tan head that settles to a ring around the glass and a little bubbles throughout the rest.  Damn there's a lot going on in the flavor here. First sip was really hard to pin down. Lets see, licorice, black malt, dark caramel, brown sugar and that's just the malt. Nice hop bitterness keeps it very balanced, I don't pick up any hop flavor. Then there's the wood effects, lots of vanilla and an earthy character too. At first I didn't get much from the yeast but as it warmed I got more deep ripe fruit.  Huge bodied with a light but appropriate carbonation level. Slightly warming in the mouth and stomach but not overly alcohol tasting.

The taste is complex too, lightly sweet with a choco-maltiness and a grassy hop balance. The finish has a light caramel note with some fruity alcohols, but also has a touch of bitterness to round things out. The mouthfeel is moderately heavy, has a medium carbonation and decent smoothness.  Many Dogfish Head brews seem overly sweet/malty to me, but this one strikes a nice balance, which is especially amazing considering its strength. In fact this beer is almost dangerous.

There is little head maybe an 1/8 of an inch and that dissipates to absolutely nothing but an oily haze on the surface of the beverage.  The scent is more like an imperial stout then a brown ale. There is rum soaked dark fruit scent mixed with a woody almost pine scent. Mixed in the background is subtle caramelized malts and light vanilla notes.  The taste is just short of outstanding. It is a rich full bodied brown ale that has a great balance of flavors. Sweet roasted malts are the backbone of this brew with an earthy woody pine flavor always on the flip side. There are some chocolate notes mixed with some raisin flavors all finished by a candied sugar taste reminiscent of a Belgian tripple.  How has this one been off my radar for so long? There is a mild carbonation that really lets the flavors come through. It's so smooth its hard to taste the 12% abv. However at about half a glass you sure can feel it.

Taste follows with good roasted malt character, Some sort of a sweetness to the wood flavor in here. Some vanilla and a bit of spice. Mouthfeel is solid here, with some good viscosity as I would expect from what I would call an imperial brown ale. Drinkability is pretty good for the abv but this one is quite hot.

Pours a dark marron with caramel colored head dissapates quickly with little lacing. Strong alcohol in the smell, a warning to drink slow and enjoy, I think of brandy or barrel aged bourbon as much as beer, though there are definate hints of dates, vanilla, and candy malt. The alcohol gets more powerfull as the beer warms, but the flavor deepens accordingly. And what a flavor, the strong alcohol in the nose dissapears on the lips leaving a sweet vanilla begining, a delicious maltness, definate caramel presence and a soft enveloping earthy finish. I can't belive how smooth this beer is, and how delicious. It rolls over the tongue and begs for another sip. Serve at cellar temp.

It had a potent aroma, brandy and chocoloate and dark fruits and alcohol. It was really appealling but daunting, you can tell it's a sipper from the first sniff. The taste was really complex, lots of sweetness from malts, chocolate, brown sugar or toffee, dark fruits like plums and raisins, and brandy or whiskey, kind of similar in ways to KBS.

10099,33832,becktone,4.7,"From notes 8-11-08  Eye: Damn! This looks more like a porter than a brown ale. The color is very dark, so dark I can't tell if the beer is clear or cloudy...it looked clear when pouring. I would say that the color is either extremely dark brown or black. Head is creamy in appearance and is light brown in color. Very nice retention, formation and lacing.  Nose: Very strong aroma, fruity (banana), hot and some spice from the alcohol. This is a malt driven brew. Further down are some roasted notes and some chocolate malt. Slight woodiness, but barely perceivable, it took me knowing it should be there to find it. Complex aroma, quite nice, very potent.  Tongue: Roasted and chocolate malts are prevalent. The woody flavor of the barrels definitely comes through...it is a dry earthy and, well, woody flavor. Caramel flavor is in here as well, and some vanilla too, though it only seems apparent on the front of the tongue after the beer is swallowed....not so, it is there while the beer still rests in the mouth, the same type of vanilla sweetness and flavor as a milk stout. Roasted grain bitterness. Some of that banana ester is in there too, melding with the vanilla. Woody drying flavor is also present. Alcohol is present, but doesn't play a big role in the flavor, its not terribly up front either, rather it is just there, not calling attention to itself, but still present being discovered only after your palate finds these other flavors. This is one complex beer, it is damn good. I'd buy it again, though not in the summer it think, this would be a great beer on a nice fall day.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Full bodied with a slightly warm mouthfeel from alcohol. Low carbonation is appropriate. Dry finish on this beer. This is definitely one to be sipped, enjoy it over a long period of time. I'm sure that at some point I will pick this up again, though I am always on the quest to try something different so I doubt it will be anytime soon.

This head. Smell is overwhelmingly of boozy black fruit.  Taste is first & foremost hot with the devil that is alcohol, which dominates intially. There are some interesting flavors underneath the hard-alchy blast, subtle fruity on the top of the tongue that starts to moderate the alcohol. Only a touch of woody taste, not oak or barrel that I'm used to, but pleasantly muted.  Hoo-boy. Four or five sips & I can feel my belly warming to the Jim Beam, I mean Palo.

Initially hits the tongue a little hot, but is immediately covered by the rich caramel, roasted flavors from the grains & barrels. Very rich and smooth flavor all the way through, with maybe just a touch of hops noted at the very end. I was thinking there may be a tannin bite at the end, but was happy not to really find one.

It's a little boozy, but in a good way. Wood is also very apparent.  T: Sweet molasses, dark fruits like currants, wood. A little spicy, black pepper, nutmeg, . It even reminds me of a dark rum.  M&D: Very smooth, a little dry at the end. Medium body, definitely thinner than an imperial stout. Extremely drinkable, the alcohol is integrated so well.

Taste starts with some sweet caramel, vanilla and rum-soaked raisins. Alcohol adds a little warmth in the middle before some toasted bread and wood notes lead back into some sweet caramel and molasses in the finish.

T- The malts are the star of this beer, bringing in notes of caramel, cocoa, brown sugar, vanilla, and hints of molasses. The dark fruits come through clearly in the taste, but there is a crisp citrusy flavor that fits surprisingly well. Complex notes of earthy wood come through with a slight alcohol-induced sweetness.

10099,33832,CrellMoset,4.32,"Bottle from Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA. Poured into a traditional American pint glass, though that may not have been the best glassware choice for this monster!  Appearance: A thick, oily, brown beer - a few shades white of black - with a creamy, coffee head, about one-and-a-half fingers tall. It fades slowly and leaves solid sheets of lacing. Very inviting.  Aroma: Sweet, sticky roasted malts - coffee, chocolate - stone and dark fruits. Very pungent - I could smell it from a few feet away.  Taste: Delicious coffee overtones are prominent. Sweet chocolate. Light citrus and sweet, ripe stone fruits. Some darker, sweeter fruits - sweet golden raisins - further along. Some earthy roastiness. Vanilla hints, maple syrup, and tons of other oaky, woody notes throughout, though particularly at the height of the sip. Sweet alcohol in the finish. Chocolate becomes more noticeable as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Big bodied and smooth, thick and syrupy, slight warming alcohol feel in the finish.  Drinkability: 12% abv, but it's so smooth and sweet it's hardly noticeable. I really like this one - don't know why it took me so long to pop it open. It's been sittin' in my fridge for at least six months! Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Dmann,4.68,"It's rare to find a truly unique beer these days, and Dogfish Head has come through with a winner. The pour was great with nice lace and a silkiness that lined the glass beautifully. The aroma was quite intense with brown sugar, slight coffee and dark chocolate tones and prune scents all mixed together to form a very inviting scent. Flavors were very intense with slight port wine flavors mixed with bitter dark chocolate and a smoky aftertaste. It was a big surprise that there was not more of an alcohol flavor in there but the 12% blended in perfectly. Highly recommended and definantly let it warm a bit for maximum flavor.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,lpayette,4.34,"Appearance- Pours a reddish brown in the light but don't be surprised that this ""american brown ale"" appears more porter like in the glass than it does sienna brown. Head it khaki colored with about 1/3 of a finger covering once things settle out. Some lacing.  Smell- Sounds crazy, but it reminds me of smoked salmon(slightly salty) in a very subtle and pleasant way. Smell is clearly malt driven with some bitterness coming mostly from roasted/chocolatey malts as opossed to alpha acids from hops. Espresso overtones but nothing overbearing or even suggesting the actual addition of coffee beans. Prunes/dark and over-ripened fruit. Fruity alcohol and light tobacco. Overall quite complex and interesting.  Taste and Mouthfeel- Smooth and slightly hot, yet not as much heat as one might expect from a brew weighing in at 12% ABV. Light carbonation... gets better as it warms. Taste is overall a bit on the chocolatey side with a plethora of amazingly complex attributes. Smokey (again the salty salmon for me), nutty, prunes, plenty of woody flavors, lightly tobaccoish.  Drinkablity/Conclusion- Quite the drinkable and enjoyable beer at 12%. Expensive, but well worth it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Jmamay22,4.25,"Pours out like an Imperial Russian Stout, very dark brown nearly black opaque beer with a burnt tan head that eventually dissipates to only a collar. No lacing.  Smells of chocolate, raisin and brown sugar with a roasted edge. I can't make up my mind if I'm smelling maple and nuts or if the label is influencing my perceptions.  Initially sweet and chocolate with a bitter and nutty finish. The aging on wood contributes to the aftertaste and creates a spicy finish. Alcohol is nowhere to be seen despite the huge content. There's hints of molasses here and there as well.  Mouthfeel dances the fine line between medium and thick. Moderate carbonation. A sure sipper, but the alcohol, as mentioned, lacks the presence I had expected. Damn good beer, but a bit pricey.

Chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and some alcohol in the nose. Very pleasant. Similar to the appearance, the smell is more like a baltic porter than any brown ale I've ever had. The porter/stout theme continues in the taste, with all the good stuff hitting your nose showing up on your tongue as well. All that and some crisp maltiness, with some hops and you've got a very tasty, balanced brew.  Despite quite a bit of alcohol warmth, this stuff is still quite drinkable. I can imagine the warmth wouldn't bother me on cold, snowy maine day, so maybe 85 and humid wasn't the best time to drink this.

Nose isn't super vibrant and doesn't have a lot complexity. Mainly dominated by roast, it also has hints of caramel, raisin and a touch of palo santo wood. Flavor has much complexity than the nose.

It poured thick and dark brown, looks fantastic in the glass with a one inch head that settled quickly.  The first aroma was of carmel with a slight hint of vanilla, but you pick up a little oak at the same time. It smells good but not as good as it tastes.  The taste is honestly to complex for my untrained pallet to distinguish all the flavors. The carmel, roasted malt, vanilla and slight coffee flavors all come through equally and are smoothed out by that hint of oak. I didn't really notice the alcohol flavor.  This beer was so drinkable. It's really smooth not too bubbly and certainly not filling. I enjoyed just sipping and trying to figure out what flavor was coming next. This was truly one of the better beers I have ever enjoyed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

10099,33832,smitty2717,4.25,Probably the most unique brown ale i have ever encountered. DFH has developed a perfectly balanced high alcohol content beer. The distinct flavors hit your mouth in stages: Vanilla is strong up front then gives way to the wood aged aspects along with a smokey flavor that finishes clean and leaves a nice hint of the caramel and the alcohol at finish. The drinkibility is impressively high. Will defininetly be good with anything off the BBQ!!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,phishgator,3.77,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Foamy tan head, half an inch and laces well. The color is a dark/opaque brown, no light through except the edges when glass is tilted. Reminds me more of an abbey or stout color. Nutty, licorie, and malt are all on the nose. The taste is much the same as the aroma. The difference comes from the slick oils that coat the mouth from probably the hops. A big brown ale, but the taste reminds me more of a stout. Big bodied, alcohol is well hidden in the big flavor profile. Just drink a couple in a sitting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

The first sniff is malty with a lacquer like scent. The initial sip is woody, malty with an ethanol like alcohol burn, but in no way bad. Its got a coffee like flavor that shows up at the back of the mouth. There's a hidden almost prune like flavor hidden there among the hopless oaky flavors that deveolp mid glass. This is a very complex beer with many many layers of flavor dancing around the high octane base. I wasn't sure what to expect. I've never seen anything like this.

Light roasty malts with some strong hints of chocolate. The alcohol is well perceived.  The flavor is just about the same as the aroma with the roasty malts and the hints of chocolate. Some of the wood can be tasted. Full bodied with medium carbonation, very chewy. The alcohol gives a strong warming sensation with each sip.  This is definitely a sipping beer. Serve it in a wine glass, snifter, tulip, whatever. If in pint glass, take small sips. Because of this I lowered the drinkability score. It's a fine beer though, worthy of the Dogfish Head lineup.

There is so much going on here, like a fine cognac, coffee and chocolate rolled into one. Rum soaked raisins, figs, cocoa, pipe tobacco... this one has it all!  T: It doesn't seem possible, but everything in the nose also shows up on the palate. There is just a bit too much alcohol burn, but whaddaya expect from 12%? Good hop balance keeps this malt bomb from being overly cloying.  M: Rich, thick, full-bodied... but the alcohol cuts through just enough to keep it from being overbearing.

I let things warm up, but the flavors that come out in the smell seem to be just lingering a bit beneath the surface. That said, very interesting.  Mouthfeel is heavenly smooth.

Nose consists almost entirely of ceder and dark malt with a light hint of hops and alcohol. On the palate dark and viscous malt, hints of vanilla, ceder and light sour cherries. Wood really adds to the flavor. Silky smooth, almost creamy, chewy with a nice long finish that starts to show a bit of the 12% abv.

Smell was dark fruits, some spice, perhaps, dark roasted (burnt?) malts and alcohol. Taste reflected the same with emphasis on the dark fruit and alcohol, although I don't believe this drank like a 12%'er; 9....9 and change maybe, but not 12. Mouthfeel was sensational! (IMO) *This* is the kind of beer I like to relax with shortly before bed. Heavy. Thick. Almost oily. Perhaps the second week of July in Ga. isn't the best time for this one; perhaps the second week of November would be better.

Not much lacing remained as the beer was consumed.  I need to mention now that I think this beer was served way to cold. I mention this here because I really think it affected the aroma. At first the beer had the aroma of rubbing alcohol and not a great deal more. As the beer warmed up to what I felt was a more appropriate temperature the aroma was much more complex and what I would have expected. Then there was some black licorice, vanilla and almost a bourbon like quality to that aroma.  The flavor became much more complex and frankly much better as the beer warmed as well. Vanilla, brown sugar the black licorice again.... All nice tastes the bounced around as you enjoyed the beer. Also a nice roasted malt taste that complemented the initial flavors I mentioned. There still was a sense of alcohol here that could not be hidden. I was left wondering if they chose to drop the ABV by a point or two they might have had a superior brew.

Frankly, it looks like a Russian Imperial Stout. Considering that I like that style far mroe than your typical brown ale, that's not a bad thing. The carbonation level is quite high (unusual for dogfish head) and is needed, as this is a thick, syrupy brew.  I'm a sucker for vanilla. Love it, love it. The smell of this is rich malt, vanilla, chocolate, and woodsy/earthy tones. I can't put my finger on the wood. I guess this is brewed in some sort of exotic container, but it just smells ... loamy.  The taste continues the trend. There isn't an overload of the smokey/roasted malt here; it's mostly creamy and sweet, with definite chocolate overtones.

A little alcohol in the nose.  T/M/D: Roasted malt leads the taste. Some anise, candy sugar, brown sugar and hints of vanilla and coffee. Sweet at first, with a slightly drier finish. I have tried this fresh and after a few months in the cellar. Can easily taste the Palo Santo wood flavor in the fresh beer, but it kind of mellows and takes a backseat with age. More carbonation that i was expecting - carbonation gives a little bite and a bubbly mouthfeel. Even at 12% abv it doesn't taste much more alcoholic than your average session brew. Dangerously easy to drink - I could easily have another. Brown ale? More like a porter. I think this will age very well.

Head jumps up immediately to about a finger and a half, recedes rather quickly to a nice thick film that never really reliquishes. Good initial lacing.  Aromas of strong alcohol-infused woodiness, mild notes of vanilla and sweet dark but not roasted malt. The flavors give back a lot of the same, adding some nice dark fruits and a bit of baker's chocolate dry-bitterness.  There's a ton going on here. It's really terrific in the mouth, initially rushing the palate with the carbonation and multiple flavors, but the longer you sit with it the better things turn out to be.

Smell is sweet and fruity with spicy, savory notes of wood-aged vanilla.  Taste is toasty and earthy with wood, caramel, and a healthy dose of chocolate. The drink is fairly sweet, chocolatey, woody, as noted, and has a nice bitter cocoa powder finish. The drink is softer, richer, and roastier as it warms a bit.  This is no wimpy brown ale; this bastard is big and bold with unusual flavors that really shake up my perceptions of what a 'brown ale' is, and ought to be.

Let's get right on over to the drinkability quotient...because i may have to open a second one to finish this review. The 12% ABV is masterfully integrated. The smell is amazingly complex. The aroma comes across as a silky rich vanilla, deep-dark caramel, ""going to loose your mind in this double stout"" character. The mouth feel is equally complex. Scoring mega-points for imagination and creativity. It's smooth with an altogether silky coating texture. Full flavored, the taste is a mirror image of the nose.

Deep rich brown half finger head has half decent retention, but leaves absolutely no lace or bubbles in the glass. Looks like a flat stout, not the brown ale described...  S- Very interesting. Molasses and malt come to the mind first, followed by a tiny hint of plums, and a fair amount of solvent alcohol. not enough to burn your nose, just enough to let you know its there. Smells quite sweet.  F- Not expected at all. Only a touch sweet up front, but with a long lingering dry middle and finish. There still seems to be some semblance of malt sugars in there, but the wood really shines here. This isn't your typical wood aged beer, as this is quite different from oak. More complex, subtle, and well blended. Vanilla type flavors are present, but I can actually taste the wood. It ""tastes"" light a very tight grain wood, that is hard for its size.... if that makes any sense whatsoever. The flavor is actually similar to anything you may have had smoked over olive wood. Very interesting.  M- Thick, heavy, smooth. Quite nice.  D- the alcohol does begin to warm quite a bit, even after only a couple of sips. A slow sipper to enjoy over a long period of time.  Overall, a very interesting, very very different beer, that I enjoy quite a bit.... just not right now. This would be great in the dead of winter, not June.

For as thick as it looks it's has a nice body. A creamy fluff in the mouth. The alcohol content in this a very deceiving because the brew has such a mellow taste. Slow roasted coffee with a hearty amount of vanilla and a dash of maple syrup. A kiss of hops in the finish and a nice warming in the chest as it goes down.

More like a porter in the nose with all the roasted malts but I guess Dogfish will call it whatever they want haha.  Taste is similar to the smell with a really nice melding of all the flavors. I really enjoyed the taste. A really interesting one from Dogfish Head and its nice to see a new beer in their lineup.  For the nice woody taste and smell, this one is really lacking in the mouthfeel department for me. Its sort of thin and too fizzy (over carbonated) in my opinion.

10099,33832,grandq,2.94,"Glugs from the bottle a viscous, deep brown with a fluffy and ample dark tan head. Looks rather inviting, but the initial whiff puts me off - initially picking up nothing but alcohol, resembling nail polish remover. This thankfully lets up to reveal some wood and molasses. Tastes a great deal like Raison d'Etre on steroids (haven't tried d'extra, but I reckon they're similar). Still, I'm getting very little but maple syrup and paint thinner with a malty base. The thick and coating mouthfeel means the tongue can't escape the fusal fumes. Can't finish it.  I definitely wouldn't classify this as an American Brown, though my lower points aren't merely an indication of an ill-fitting style. I could hardly make my way through half the bottle but decided to let the rest sit and oxidize for a bit and it really helped settle things down and blend the more welcome flavors. Vanilla along with tannic and roasted notes emerge aplenty and the alcohol becomes more bitter than searing. Much much better, though now the sweetness is off the scales.  I feel like I'm reviewing two different beers. Given my impression of this fresh, I'm only willing to raise my marks to ""average.""

Was a little confused at first because I could smell the wood in the beer and the first couple of sips made me think of the stone 11th anniversary. So I almost thought it might be the blended IPA beer that they make with a little roastiness thrown in.  It poured brown/black, murky with a tan head. Good lacing. Smell is woody and caramelly. Taste is roasty, bitter, and brown. Also some moderate alcohol presence but I had no idea it was 12% when I had it. The body was both good and bad so I gave it a 3. The body was real thick and oily but it was very smooth and consistent.

10099,33832,biegaman,4.15,"Sun dried prune coloured body; despite appearing black head on and rarely giving off highlights, you can manage to detect some plum shade in there still. No head, hardly an outer lacing even, although some bubbles crackled off the pour. It's a damn classy looking beverage, I'll tell you that much ...  The aroma certainly has an obvious nuance to it, but is something akin to what I've come accustomed to with bourbon-barrel stouts; in other words, the wood is noticeable but not distinct. Ashy notes of roasted malts, rich espresso, anise, and dark chocolate are all blended into this wood character. Dried fruit dosed with alcohol is also a fair to say, very similar to port. This is port-meets-porter.  Especially as it warmed the 12% thinned out what could otherwise be a hefty, rich, roasted malt monster. While the brown malts are definitive, I might guess this at more of a porter. It is a touch sweet and fruity, but also a touch chocolaty and plenty roasted. It's smooth on sip yet resounds later with a harsh and long lasting bitterness that erases any memory of sweeter, dried fruits.  Especially given the beer's unique makeup, flavours can be difficult to pin point. Again we have a bit of everything but an abundance of nothing. You can certainly taste a lot, but to say definitively what requires a little imagination.  Coffee grinds and espresso may be slight, perhaps just an association derived from the similarities in bitterness/roast? (although these are the flavours that last longest.) There is a big malty body, to be sure, with some 'wood' character. Certainly dried fruits - raisins, prunes, dates - are by far most conceivable and make this very much port-like.  As usual, this is a fascinating and innovative offering from a brewery that strives on pushing the envelope. I respect them, and for this reason I don't like to say this, but, as usual, this is a DogFish Head beer that turned out considerably more normal than it sounded it would be.  It's a good beer, and while perhaps unique in creation, this is not so ""off-centered"" tasting.

10099,33832,MiScusi,3.46,"A- Yeah that looks probably like what an imperial brown ale should. Actually reminds me very much of what Deschutes Abyss looked like with a dark black body and a generous brown fluffy head.  S- Originally it seemed to have a bit of roasted barley, coming across much like a porter (imperial). But as it warms up there is a fruity sweetness that comes out in the aroma in the forefront of a thick malt backbone.  T- Starts off with molasses, WOOD (one would think oak probably), alcohol. Some of that fruit that seems to come out in the aroma also seems to be here in small amounts at the beginning. Finishes dry and tannic.  M- This is a syrup. That's expected though at 12% ABV. Carbonation plays pretty much no part in this, although the bottle is fairly well carbonated, it just has a hard time peaking out over the massive amounts of malt in here.  D- Interesting beer here that I am enjoying being able to try but I don't think this flavor profile is really my favorite out there.

10099,33832,USCTrojanBrian,3.8,"12oz bottle (sent directly from the brewery, thanks!), dated 2/11/08. Simultaneous tasting with fellow BA Mi Scusi. Poured into a snifter.  The overall impression I had of this beer was a sweet but not too sweet brown, richly colored (mostly pitch black, but some wonderful burgundy in the more shallow portions of the glass), complex beer.  At first the wood flavor was like raw oak, fresh and not flavorful the way it would be in a wine barrel or bourbon barrel, etc. Nor should it have been, as this was a different wood and under different conditions. But then later the taste came out a bit more, and unintentional or intentional I don't know, but it sort of acted like wood with wines: mellowing the flavor.  This beer to me, almost would have been like the World Wide Stout from DFH, wayyy sweet and loaded with alcohol flavor, but that wood really helped here. It cut the alcohol flavor and taste considerably, cut the sweetness a bit, boosted the bouquet, just made this beer better. Or maybe I'm hallucinating.  With some steady warming obviously more and more was revealed. It got a bit more watery in taste, but that helped actually. The sweetness went from a non-sticky, sort of molasses-like, or brown sugar like sweetness to more of a fruity, cherry or apple-like sweetness.  I don't think the intent here was to have this be a ""regular"" beer, but rather a unique sipper for the occasional sitting once or twice a year. As I finish writing this the flavors keep improving and I've definitely bumped my taste grade, if not the mouthfeel.  Complaints? Hmm ... as noted this is more of a one sitting beer, you're there to respect it and pick apart its offerings. It's a bit tart if we're getting picky. Well-crafted without a doubt, its an unreplicated offering and as such has added to the beer world.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Mahagony coloring, tastes kind of nutty but sweet, also smoky. Very complicated. Also has a bit of a berry taste initially. Also has a very malty taste to it. Has a banana tasting finish to it.

Smell is dark roast coffee and wood with some sharp alcohol - should mellow out with aging. Taste is marvelously complex. Vanillas and caramels out front with good bitter roastiness and slight alcohol burn. This is like the Dogfish Indian Brown Ale gone to college. It lost some of that hoppiness and gained a whole lot more depth. Mouthfeel is great, silky smooth and full, none of the thinness that similarly alcoholic beers have.

This is definitely a sipping beer and something meant to be enjoyed. The flavors are full and rich - slight sweetness from the caramel malts, a little roasted flavor, dark fruits like plums and maybe even black grapes. The alcohol is well hidden and just gives a slight warmth at the end. There is slight tannic bite from the barrel which seems to balance things out nicely. It's a big brown ale with a lot more complexity.  M - Big and chewy. Not like a barleywine chewy but there is definitely a chewy maltiness there. Not cloyingly sweet like you would think at 12% - it actually finishes somewhat sweet/dry. It's the mouthfeel that I'm really enjoying most with this beer.  D - I didn't really know what to expect for sampling this.

I shared a sip with some Japanese friends who described it as tasting like boiled konbu, which is a thick, dark-green seaweed used for making soup bases and sauces. this is definitely a sipping beer that i think would be nice on a chilly night beside an open fire.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,WesWes,4.55,"The beer pours a dark brown, almost black color with a 1/4"" tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a warm crystal and roasted malt scent along with a nice vanilla aroma laid over a mild woodiness. The taste is just as good. It has a smooth malty flavor that is rich and complex. It's dry and roasted with hints of vanilla and a sweet crystal malt finish. The wood mellows the 12% abv. and adds another layer of compleity. The mouthfeel is perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is one tastey beer. I'm glad Dogfish is back making extreme ""beers"", not wine/beers; or whatever you call their last few new ones.

Smell: A sweet and alcoholy aroma with vanilla being very strong as well.  Taste: Starts off with vanilla and nuttiness. Woody flavor, not oaky, but woody, kicks in next and mingles nicely. Big alcohol finish along with the sweet caramel flavors associated with a brown. Nice complexity.  Mouthfeel: Thick to medium with medium carbonation. Big ABV tingles the tongue and warms after the swallow. Alcohol and sweet vanilla aftertaste. Nice.  Drinkability: Very tasty beer. The 12% ABV may limit you. Very thick and heavy as well.

There was a tiny bit of lacing. It had a fruity, caramel aroma. There was a pronounced vanilla taste, as well as the fruit and caramel. Hops appeared late. The alcohol was very noticeable, but tempered by the vanilla. A rich, rewarding beer. I imagine it would cellar well.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Gmann,3.9,"Pours a near black oily color with a smaller brown head. Looks very much like a stout. The aroma is of a rich and roasted malt, plums, raisins, with light hints of coffee, wood. The taste is of roasted malt, coffee, sour unrippened fruit, wood, vanilla, some rum booziness. The brew is well bodied with soft carbonation that gives it a silky feel. The finish is a bitter roasted malt and an alcohol belly burn; a bit sticky. The beer definitely improves as it warms, giving rise to the nice malt and dark fruit flavors. The booze is out in the open, no hiding here. 12% is a bit much for a brown ale, so only one. Going to let a couple age for a bit and see what happens.  *On Tap* Pretty much same experience as out of the bottle, per my review. The ABV seems to be hidden better.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Zorro,4.03,"Super dark brown colored beer on the verge of black, looks like used motor oil. Very slight brown head forms but dies. The only light that passes is at the very edges.  Smell is sweet and boozy with a fig and coffee aroma with some fruit I can't identify at this moment. Little but of plum wine, licorice and mint in this too, a bit spicy.  The taste starts out sweet and strong and ends with a coffee aftertaste. Fruity combined with stout describes this well.  Mouthfeel is good.  Something here doesn't mesh like it is actually two different beers in one. Imperial British Pale Ale and an Imperial Porter mixed. Thing is they don't really mix here so much as they coexist so you don't get the Black & Tan effect.

Poured like motor oil to spread that sweet imperial licorice and caramel malt scent all over. Sipped it to notice it was roasted and charred around the edges with an alcohol wallop. It's super strong and the 12% alcohol is definitely apparent. If I didn't know it was a nut brown ale of some sort I would think it was a sweetened imperial stout. Very dark. It's almost like the alcohol separates itself from the rest of the ingredients as it swishes around in my mouth. I'd better subtly sip this one or I'll be a goner in no time. It's very complex and compelling and I find myself wanting to figure it out but that'll leave me laid out. Mmm. I like it.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

The label has a blurb about how the ale is aged in handmade wooden brewing vessels that are the largest built in post-prohibition America.  A: Pour a deep mahogany and is black in the glass. Capped by a light brown head that sticks to the side of the glass.  S: A fantastically complex nose. Caramel, vanilla bean, hints of coffee bean, slightly woody, and smokey. The higher ABV is al  T: Powerful and complex. Again, hints of vanilla, caramel, mild coffee, more wood on the palate, and a smokey finish. Warms the stomach with alcohol.  M: A medium to heavy bodied brew, especially for a brown ale. Moderate carbonation tingles the tongue and lends a creaminess to the texture.  D: A great big beer.

10099,33832,trpng0bily,4.43,"Wow. This doesn't look like any brown ale I've ever seen. This is so dark, almost completely opaque, that you can just barely see that it is brown and not pitch black. This is as dark as brown can possibly get. The head is meak, even with a vigorous pour, and is gone in a flash. The smell is of banana, vanilla and sweet caramel malts. The taste is...huge. There is bitter chocolate, banana, sweet, roasty malt, a vanilla aftertase and, I swear, there is a peaty quality to this beer (could that be the wood?). The mouthfeel is as creamy as any stout, syrupy without being too sweet, and with mild to moderate carbonation. As to the drinkability, I thought would have trouble getting through one bottle, but I find myself getting started on a second - for a brew as rich as this one, that is quite impressive.  Frankly, it is difficult to rate a beer like this. It is unlike any other beer I've ever tasted. I know Dogfish like to push the envelope, but this brew really is remarkable in the extent to which it plays by its own rules, even by Dogfish's standards. If for no other reason, this brew is worth trying (even at $13 for a 4-pack) for its uniqueness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Aroma reminds me of mocha coffee, banana, vanilla beans, earth, and caramel.  Heavy body reveals a nice woody flavor surrounded by dark chocolate, coffee, and a sweet caramelly vanilla like finish. It is not heavily present, but some alcohol can certainly be detected. All this with a nice hop backbone make for a very flavorful brew.  I like the way this beer is crafted, there are so many flavors going on here that it almost seems strange to me. It's not that they are bad, just different. Then again, what can you expect from DFH?

The size and the color and I knew I was a goner...  Appearance&gt; Coffee. No head. Black as night.  Smell&gt; Burnt chocolate, coffee. woah.  Taste&gt; Extremely complex. Started out with a distinct taste of bananas, followed by a big punch of mexican chocolate, that flavor dissipates quickly into a full resiny flavor, smoothing out at the finish. Oddly enough, this unique concoction was extremely balanced. It was hard to consider this a brown ale for all of its complexity, but wow. Its nice.  Mouthfeel&gt; Sooo creamy. Like full fat milk.

10099,33832,cokes,4.5,"This is imperial black, trimmed with only a gradient of crimson. The head is a short and squat buttery tan, fading quickly, then durable as a collar. Nose of toffee, fudge, butter, tobacco, espresso, figs, anise, Brandy, lacquer, and vanilla. Across the mouth, it is full of deep malty fudge and molasses. Anise develops as does a pronounced sense of fig. It turns earthy for a moment, with tree bark, dirt, tobacco, spent coffee grounds, and chicory. Then back to sweet with a jammy concord grape and black cherry slathered in caramel, and toffee, and vanilla butter cream. Booze hits at the close with a like-minded impression of Brandy, complete with a twinge of burn. Woodiness is on the low end, but it accents the caramel and brings some tannins. Hop flavor is almost entirely drowned out, but bitterness is present and semi-balancing (considering). Full bodied, carbonation is nearly negligible, but a bubble or two gurgles up periodically. Even with the notable ABV and molten thickness, it's readily and enjoyably dispatched. More than one in a sitting might be gluttony, but it nearly begs for it. Still this is better served as a nightcap, one and done. It's a thoroughly fascinating beer, but not for the reasons I'd have expected. The Palo Santo wood plays a minor role, but a congruent and beneficiary one. This ultimately plays out like a huge malt-bomb English Russian Imperial Stout (think: Sam Smith, but much larger) all full of Fruit Cake, Earth, Booze, and Wood.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

The alcohol is noticeable, but only in a warming fashion.  M- Pretty creamy and smooth. The carbonation level is good. The alcohol is really well hidden.

Notes: I do believe this beer is a Brown Ale,but a cross breed. Almost seemed like a Porter and even bordered on Imperial stout ground. I know it is neither,yet it just seemed like no other Brown Ale I have ever had. A bit extreme and I liked it. At 12% ABV it was extremely smooth. Very drinkable,but not session at all.

Chocolate, smoke, coffee, vanilla, toffee, sweet malts, and that earthiness again... I still can't believe this is a brown ale. I know the ABV is significantly higher than a normal brown but I don't really get much booziness in this either... Perhaps a little on the finish but certainly not 12%.

Smells of rich malt, dark roasted coffee, alcohol, and burnt sugar. I really don't know what to look for when it comes to the smell of Palo Santo.  Sooo smooth and instantly warming! I love it. Tastes of dark toasted malt, bitter coffee along with some tangy sweetness. I definitely get the alcohol kick at the back of my tongue. Its got some qualities that are similar to a red wine, its a hearty strong beer with a bit of a dry fruit flavor at the end of each sip (this is definitely one you'll want to sip).

10099,33832,MSchae1017,4.5,"The beer pours an opaque brownish-black with a creamy mocha like head (just as the video says). Even with the massive alcohol content, the head lingers and laces well, probably due to the addition of wheat. The aroma is quite potent with caramel and molasses like sweetness dominating rounded off by a bit of chocolate and mysterious spice. Sipping the beer, it rushes forth with a massive sweetness. Again flavors of chocolate, caramel, and brown sugar are present, but the wood has added its own spicy, earthy characteristic unlike any other wood aged beer I have had. Alcohol is present in the finish, but provides more of a warming sensation and does not bring down the drinkability. This may be due to the smoothness that Scotch Ale yeasts tend to impart. The beer displays a full body and smooth carbonation. Amazingly, this beer is easy to drink considering the 12% ABV. While this is massively sweet and malty, it is pleasant and balanced. Oftentimes, Dogfish Head will put out incredibly interesting beers that I feel compelled to try once and then never return to.

Oak also plays a background role, especially before this brew warms up.  T - Taste is sweet with molasses and nutty, dark fruit flavors. Bitter dark chocolate with coffee accents adds complexity. Finish is incredibly dry with its strong oak flavor that almost leaves me parched and in need of water. Really interesting combination of flavors, with the oak working really nicely in this beer.

D - As others have said, I find it hard to believe this is 12% ABV, which I guess makes it incredibly drinkable. On the other hand, it gets very filling as the beer wears on.

Poured to a pint glass, after it warmed a good 20 minutes out of the fridge  A: Dark, dark brown, although seeming to have a faint purplish/blueberry hue. Pours with a fizzy, crackling tawny head, rising to just over a finger-high before dropping to an active, sparkling film. Lace is minimal.  S: Big aroma of dark syrupy caramel, spiced fruit (cherries, plums, sweet berries), earthy chocolate shavings, a little rum- or brandy-barrel woodiness.  T: Malty caramel, molasses, ripe fruit (raspberry, cherry or blueberry), bittersweet chocolate. Wood-aging gives some light spice and a subtle vanilla bean. Like a sweetened dessert-coffee spiked with a shot of booze. Deeper smoky-char bittering builds in the finish.  M: Luscious, thick mouthfeel - chewy. Borderline 'sticky'. Carbonation seems mellow, smooth. Bittering creeps up and builds in layers, casting a toasty/husky dryness that lingers. High alcohol reveals through a steady warming; it's not hidden but isn't totally 'in-your-face' either.  D: A hefty beer that deserves respect...one bottle is just fine to end the evening on. Lacks some drinkability not because of its alcoholic muscle, but more because the flavors are so heavy without offering a ton of complexity - frankly it grew a little boring towards the end. Still, it's worth picking up a single (or 4-pack) to appreciate on occasion and worth the effort getting this sent from the East Coast. Thanks again, Pete!  Comments: Oh Dogfish Head, the things you guys do to push the boundaries of 'craft beer'. A quick sorting of the BA database for 'American Brown Ale' finds only 3 beers having more than an 8% ABV, none (besides this) above 10%.

10099,33832,eberkman,4.07,"Poured an opaque, dark mahogany with a pinkish-brown head -- about a finger's worth that diminished fairly quickly to a ring. Looks like an RIS from my vantage point.  Smells like one too. Creamy vanilla, dark berries, pungent dark chocolate, molasses, and a sherrylike wininess as well. A lot going on in the nose, that's for sure.  Very rich taste -- the dark berries and winey grapes really come out big here with a bitter, dark-roasted coffee finish. Lots of vanilla along the edges.  Oozy, oily mouthfeel with very light carbonation. But surprisingly light and silky at the same time -- not sure if I like it that much. With flavors as big as this one has, it should have more heft to it.  A typical brown ale would be a session beer. This is anything but. It's a nice, relaxing, just-before-bed slow sipper. Would be a great dessert beer too. Big and boozy, though the alcohol doesn't ruin the taste.  I stand by my initial observation that this invokes a RIS much more than a Brown Ale. Interesting, because I believe when I reviewed Indian Brown Ale, I thought it tasted more like a stout than a brown ale. In any event, from a brewery that's always trying to out-extreme itself -- often resulting in a mess -- this is a huge beer that is actually quite sensible and enjoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

I also smell some caramel malts and a little bit of chocolate.  Sweet caramel and chocolate malts come through. This is followed with a mild spiciness/smokiness/woodiness from the wood barrels. The finish is of chocolate and vanilla.  Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The aftertaste of chocolate and vanilla is very nice as well.  Nicely complex beer that is easy to drink. I recommend it.

The wood delivers and then some; charcoal, vanilla, molasses with a hefty dose of booze on the back end.  Strong roasted malt with semi-sweet chocolate and vanilla undertones. Huge charred flavor on the finish. Charcoal grows more aggressive as the beer warms.  Actually not nearly as thick as the appearance would seem to indicate. All-in-all, it's a good beer but with limited appeal. Still, it's one of the better barrel-aged beers I've had in a while. This was a GREAT partner with some Swiss milk chocolate.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,BradLikesBrew,4.32,"a: Pitch black body, thin brown head.  s: Maple syrup, raisins, vanilla, and alcohol.  t: Rich. Dark nutty malt borders on charred. I can definitely notice the vanilla notes that the label mentions. The Palo Santo wood adds a great twist on the typical barrel-aged beer. Notes of brown sugar, molasses and sarsaparilla. Some bitterness from the dark malts. Complex for a brown.  m: Thick, syrupy, lower carbonation.  d: A sipper, no doubt about it. I like the unique flavor imparted from the exotic wood barrels. A rich and boozy beer. Enjoyable, if not quaffable. An extreme brown ale, the best of the style that I have had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Scents really light with some pancake waffle grain and buttery goodness.  First swigs: Dark malt like cocoa with a waffle spice wafer grain. Cinnamon meets pancake. Bold balance. Hops are overwhelmed with a touch of molasses. Thick and viscus.  Feel is as thick as can be! Get a fork 'cuz this one is chunky!  Last swigs: Thick syrupy maple syrup brown with enough kick azz to kick Chuck Norris's az!!! ***interesting***  Beer is good.

10099,33832,Phyl21ca,4,Bottle courtesy of Jay23: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some nice lacing. Aroma of vanilla and oak is pretty pleasant with some light roasted malt notes. Taste is a mix between some roasted malt notes with a mix of vanilla and oak and some creamy lactose notes. Full creamy body is really enjoyable with some great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done and probably one of the best new seasonal from Dogfish.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,jdubjacket,3.98,"Poured a black color into a standard pint glass. Definitely not a ""brown ale"" by the look of it. Little carbonation - if any. Malty nose with sugar & vanilla undertones. Taste is definitely a sweet surprise. Has a very sweet taste - not at all what I was expecting. Also got some dried fruit in the taste. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied. Drinkability takes a small hit b/c of the 12.0% ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,BucBasil,4.55,"Appearance: Poured from the 12oz bottle into a Piraat tulip glass. Brown ale? I don't think so... This thing is pure black, even when held to light. This beautiful specimen of a beer is topped with a dark tan frothy head with somewhat poor retention, but lacing all thw way down the glass. This looks more like and imperial stout than anything. I'm not complaining.  Smell: Nice roasted malt aroma with a smoky character through the middle. These two point to an underlying woody aroma that is extremely unique. Almost like a barbeque, this crazy beer has a slight rauchbier character throughout the nose, what supports the wide array of malts underneath, as well as a slightly sweet vanilla note. This is a great smelling beer.  Taste: Wow... that was unexpected. There is a smoky note throughout the taste, that evolves into an extremely complex taste. Next comes a very sweet note that goes from vanilla to sugarplums and dark berries to light chocolate. This is a sweet character that I have never seen in a beer before, and it was not at all cloying. The beer finishes with more of the smoky wood character, as well as a hint of light coffee with cream.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy all the way through, a perfect complement to the rich, sweet character of the beer.  Drinkability: This is one to savor, one at a time. The beer is rich and filling, but in a good way.  If I can find it again, I'll pick this one up again for a special occasion. A slow sipper for sure, and one that compliments a time of deep thought and introspection very well.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,FtownThrowDown,3.84,Pours a dark brown in color with some lightness around the edges. Not really a head at all on the pour. Smell is roasty. Taste is much the same with the wood flavor having a real presence in the beer. Full and smooth on the mouthfeel. At 12% this is a real sipper. A good offering from Dogfish Head.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,gregc,4.3,"Bottle thanks to gford217.  Poured almost black with a brown head that quickly faded. Thought i was pouring a world wide stout.  Aroma of wood, vanilla , caramel and alcohol. Smelled like a world wide stout.  Taste is vanilla, wet wood, some carame, plums, prunes and malt. The alcohol is well masked, the beer is very drinkable and smooth. Tasted like a weaker world wide stout (i see a theme here).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,RunawayJim,4.75,"Beer pours a deep brown with a small head that hangs around for a bit. Smells of vanilla and malty sweetness.  Taste is more of that vanilla mixed with caramel and a very slight toasted flavor. It's on the sweet side for a brown ale, but at this ABV and with the barrel aging, it's expected and doesn't actually detract from this beer. Rather, it makes it better. There's a very slight warmness from the alcohol, but it just adds even more to the beer.  The beer is very smooth and easy to drink. It's a little on the heavy side, but again, it was expected. I give this one 2 very enthusiastic thumbs up and strongly recommend it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,John_M,3.9,"On tap at Max's during American Craft Brew week.  The beer pours a dark brown color with decent head retention and lacing. The beer is very sweet and malty on the nose, pretty much exactly what one would expect in an imperial brown ale. The beer smells pretty good actually. On the palate this comes across as a big brown ale with moderate sweetness. At least for me, the beer is a bit too one dimensional, though the flavors are nice. The beer comes across as medium bodied, and it's not too heavy or tiring to drink. Still, the abv. wears me out after a while, and the high abv. hurts this beer's drinkability.  A good solid beer, but not an exceptional one. Given the high abv., I probably will not come back to this one again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Raymond69,4.25,"Pours with a smallish head , darker than brown , but not pitch black.  Getting hints of smoke , maybe some slight alcohol on the nose.  This beer tastes a bit like a Quad , with some added complexity with the wood giving it the trademark residual woody sweetness. If it weren't for the obvious alcohol taste I'd give it a five. Perhaps some age on this will be nice.  Mouthfeel is thick , with some residual stick sweetness. Good carbonation.  I'll be seeking more of these out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,warmstorage,3.9,"Four pack of 12 ounce bottles was $14.99 at BevMo Sacramento (Arden Way.) Very dim dating evident: appears to indicate bottling date of 2/11/08.  Appearance: Poured into wide mouthed red wine glass, a medium to deep opaque black with a medium brown head that dissipates rapidly and leaves no lacing. Quite dark given that the bottles describes it as a brown ale.  Aroma: wood molasses and some dark stonefruit. A little yeasty. Somewhat limited given the huge nature of the beer.  Taste: some deep woody vanilla notes, some stonefruit, plums, figs, and a backgrounded sweet cherry note. Finishes with woody vanilla. Nice, interesting, but somewhat mild and understated.  Mouth: Tingly and warm. Somewhat high carbonation on the mouth and throat for such a high ABV beer (which is nice, and makes it more drinkable than many 10%+ ales which are somewhat syrupy due to high finishing gravities.) Perhaps the best part of this beer.  Overall: Fairly drinkable, but somewhat undistinguished. Not something I'd buy again, but I'd drink it again if someone else was buying, and I'll certainly drink the other three.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,oberon,4.32,"Poured into a standard pint glass a deep chocolate brown with just a little light showing through a quick to form quick to fade brown head atop.Alot of stuff going on in the nose deep wood and vanilla mixed with dark fruit and chocolate just really appetizing.This brew went down very easy for such a high abv I thought it would be more of a sipping brew (wich it could be)but it glided down quite easily,flavors of dark fruit, chocolate, vanilla-like nuget and caramel mixed with slight wood this would be a fine dessert brew.A great beer almost like a port flavor wise,ejoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,kasper,3.75,"A: Pours a murky brown raison color with a small chocolate colored head that dissipates quickly, leaving just a faint ring. Only a bit of light passing through the edges of a goblet. Lacing apparent in polka-dot fashion after sipping.  S: Aroma of molasses , raisons, prunes, some smokiness and that trademark dogfish head yeast and alcohol smell. Very similar to a toned down worldwide stout (wws), judging strictly by the nose.  T: Smooth and sweet up front with loads of dark fruit, then a considerable astringent woody, smokiness punch with lingering flavors of figs, maybe currants...Really similar to a toned down wws, imho, but a bit dryer on the finish. Alcohol definitely present but not overwhelming at all.  M: Thick, sticky and chewy. Full bodied, with mild carbonation and that semi-dry woody feel on the swallow.  D: This is a real heavy brew. A sipper for sure. I'd be hard pressed to go through more than one of these. Actually, this is a good brew to share with either your significant other or a friend so you can last the night and taste some others. Strongest brown ale i've ever tasted.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Proteus93,3.72,"A: Browny brown, brown. They've taken this to the level of the imperial stouts... almost black, with a creamy brown head.  S: A lot sweeter than I would expect from a brown ale, but I suppose this isn't your typical brown ale, either. A lot of prune and date dark fruit aromas in there, and quite a woody taste... I suppose that was the point here. It's pretty unique. A bit of smokiness.  T + M + D: Smoky and sweet. Dark fruits, a bit of caramel notes... it starts to become a little sweet in the mouth after a while. DFH loves to make these extreme, huge brews, and while I applaud them for trying to go all out, sometimes the result is just alright. I feel this is one of those instances. The mouthfeel gets a little thick and sticky after a glass, though it starts off being pretty rich and creamy. Being such a huge ABV, this is a sipper, and it definitely gets a bit on the sweet side after a while. That said, it's ultimately a pretty good beer, and a decent effort from Dogfish Head... I like many of their offerings much better than this, but it's an interesting brew. Certainly give it a shot.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,SaCkErZ9,2.93,"Dispensed from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a very dark brown, almost black, but not quite. Almost a dark purple color. Interesting and beautiful. A perfectly smooth and frothy tan head, looks just like an espresso topper.  Sweet smelling with plenty of coffeelike caramel notes. Slightly fruity with some raisins and figs thrown in. Alcohol and fusels join the party as well.  Wow. Sweet and alcoholic. Some hoppiness but the alcohol is a bit overwhelming. A sweet, alcoholic mess. Creamy on the tongue saves this beer a little bit.  I was impressed with the first two categories but the rest was downhill. I keep trying these beers from DFH and am continually let down. Perhaps, I have learned my lesson. I will not be having this one again, assuming I can even finish this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Stinkypuss,4.4,"Served on tap @ Barleys and Hop's.  Appeared like a porter, very little head with slight retention. Had a strong roasted coffee nose with a hint of hops. Very tasty brew, lots going on and the wood added a depth of flavor that is almost indescribable. Coats the palate with a rich sweet mocha aftertaste. Not overpowering, but a solid brew that I'm sure I will have again. Very drinkable and delightful. Does well as it approaches room temperature.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,rallison,3.6,"Pours a black/dark brown color with a 1/2 finger light tan head that leaves a ring but nothing else. For a brown (even an imperial brown), this thing pours quite dark.  Smells of molasses and dark fruits. Chocolate-y and roasty qualities are also present. Decent, but slightly overdone in the sugary sweet malts (Surprise, surprise?).  The taste here is growing on me a bit. The dark fruits are definitely showing themselves against a woody body. There is some astringency here (most likely from the wood it would seem) that detracts a bit. Hints of chocolate and roast are back there as well. A hoppy character does seem to be back there but seems a touch overwhelmed by the astringent wood qualities. Overall, this is promising but needs some work to make it world class.  Mouthfeel on this is good. Carbonated, but still letting the richness come through. Initially, a touch syrupy. However, upon warming, for 12%, the mouthfeel is nice. The wood does also dry it out here.  Drinkability, especially given the ABV, is quite solid.  Recommended. Not highly recommended, but given a few tweaks, this could be quite good. A 4.2+ average rating? I will disagree with that.  Edit: Sorry, the astringency and dryness from the wood really hurt this beer.

Topped with a luscious mocha colored head that never made it to one finger thick. Lacing has stuck around for awhile.  Smell: I smelled it as soon as I cracked the bottle. After pouring it grew wonderfully sweet. Brown sugar, alcohol, figs, wet wood, a little bit of roasted malt.  Taste: Maple syrup, alcohol (but I'm sure the aging in the wood has calmed it down a lot), hints of vanilla, caramel, and there is some fruit in there, figs cherries? I don't know.  Mouthfeel: Oh mouthfeel is right on. Heavy, smooth, sticky. Perfect carbonation.  Overall it's pretty damn good.

10099,33832,LukeD23,4.23,"at first glance this guy looks like hes gonna bite you. Almost like a porter or stout in apperance and pours thick. The smell was good, but not great, hints of vanilla and cinnimin derive from the palo santo wood. Taste was on point, full burst of flavors the slight woody character meshes well with the smoothness of a brown ale. The mouth feel was full bodied thick and well carbonated. I want another as far as drinkablity goes.  I love the adventurous spirit at dogfish, undertakeing a huge project like this, the Palo santo tank that they built for this beer cost $150,000.

10099,33832,InsolublePancake,3.8,"A- Very dark brown, almost black; stout or porter-like in appearance. A nice half inch or so of beige head forms upon pouring.  S- Nice vanilla aroma, with a touch of roasted malt. A butterscotch-like smell is also present.  T- This has a nice vanilla, woodsy flavor, but the alcohol is also quite prominent. That's not surprising for a 12% ABV beer, but it could have been hidden better. It does contribute some raisiny esters, which are nice. Overall, good flavor.  M- Nice, full body; smooth, almost a bit creamy. Carbonation is low, which is good in this case.  D- Thanks to a high alcohol content, one bottle is more than enough at this time.  You can always count on Dogfish for interesting beers, and this one is certainly no exception. It's definitely not your typical brown ale, but it's very good. I wouldn't want to have it every day, but as a change of pace or special occasion beer, it would be great.

No highlights. A one finger deep tan head forms, then becomes a creamy ring around the glass after a couple of minutes.  Aroma is great: cherry, vanilla, wood, smoke and cocoa.  Mouthfeel is thick and closer to creamy than oily. Slightly astringent. Some alcohol burn on swallow, warming in stomach.  Flavor... smooth with dark, roasted malts. As in nose, some cherry and vanilla on palate, though fleeting. Splits the difference between an imperial brown and a stout: woody, nutty, dark malts. Good balance between bitter and sweet. Subtle alcohol on the tongue.  Unique and easily sippable despite the ABV, some age seems to have done this beer a world of good.  ___ PREVIOUS REVIEW: APP - 4 SM - 4 TASTE - 4 FEEL - 3.5 DRINK - 4  Consumed 05/06/08.  Pours a very deep brown. Fine tan head.  The aroma is subtle dark malt with a bit of woodiness, even a hint of chicory.  Flavor is dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, nuttiness. A bit like a porter. Decidedly not bitter until the significant woody aftertaste, no doubt from the special aging. Alcohol is present at finish, but not overwhelming.  Mouthfeel is thicker than expected, but not amazingly so.  I have had this on draft as well, and I do prefer it that way. The bottled version just seems a little contained and the flavors a little off right out of the bottle; it takes a little time for them to get sorted out and balanced.

Aroma is very, dare I say it? complex. dried fruits, molasses, cocoa, smokey, wood, vanilla, sugars very full for a brown ale, or any ale out there. Taste is very rich with caramel, and vanilla pushing through the oaky woody type notes. chocolate and coffee show up right before the smooth bourbon type burning soothes you.

(Pardon me while I have another)  The bouquet is of roasted chocolate malts, slight hops and I am getting a currant and black cherry tobacco finish. (Gotta run to the fridge and get another, I'll be right back)  The taste is spectacular and quite complex. Warming chocolate, malt, hops, deep fruits and a touch of hazelnuts. A slight alcohol bite. Everything I want in a dark beer. These tastes linger on the taste buds and slowly dissipate. (Crap, I'm out, gotta run to see Capone)  The body is a bit bold, but I believe that only enhances that wonderful, warming mouthfeel.

10099,33832,SammyDavisJrJrJr,4.55,"Not sure why this is showing up as retired. From what I understand, this beer will now be a continuing release, like the 120. Anyways, this is from the first release to hit the Chicagoland area.  A - Nice tan head on a dark, attractive brown body.  S - Undertones of bitter chocolate that one notes under the weight of the port-like alcohol in the nose. I did pick up some light sweet vanilla notes, along with some forest-like sweetness. Very nice.  T - For 12%, this beer is not very hot. The alcohol dominates the entry, contiunes to be somewhat prickly all the way down. Starts out sweet, again port-like, with wood tanins balencing the flavors all the way through. The hops help the wood tannins create a dry finish, which actually seemed to sweeten up in a lingering bitter chocolate flavor. This seems to have great aging potential.  M - More carbonation than I expected for a 12% brown. Still a very creamy mouthfeel, nice and full, a plus.  D - This was a lot better than I expected this beer to be young.

Some lighter flavors such as dark bread and wood. The nuttiness is there but very mild. Last in line is some bittering hops and a kick in the face of alcohol.  M - Medium to full bodied.

10099,33832,Halcyondays,4.2,"12 oz. bottle,  A: Pours a dark brown, with a thin white head, but I'll give it some slack since it is a 12% wood-aged beer, good retention, limited lacing on the sips.  S: Strong dark wood notes, molasses, sugar.  T: A tannic/herbal, almost alkaloid wood character hits at first, different from any other wood aged beer that I have had, I would say that it's pretty similar to cedar. A light sweet caramel comes out next, with a great, full French vanilla note at the end of the drink. An appetizing herbal bitterness is maintained throughout the beverage in the background.  M: Quite resiny, lighter than I expected a 12% beer to be, though it's definitely a sipper, very smooth going down, no alcohol burn at all.  D: Very easy to drink, such a tasty and complex beer, I'm glad Dogfish decided to send this out to CA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,StonyB,4.45,"Many thanks to the good peeps at Dogfish Head and Andy's Corner Bar for my getting a try of this limited release...  Appearance - Pours a dark, rich, mahogany brown, almost but not entirely opaque. A sturdy cap of creamy foam, lacing pasted to the glass. Very attractive.  Smell - Interesting. A gentle smoke and peat, hint of whiskey, earthy malt, liquer. I know, it sounds a little confusing, but it works.  Taste - Sweet and warming. Cognac, brown sugar, scotch, fruit - whoa. Just like in the aroma, a variety of sensations coming together into a cohesive whole. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel - Thick, creamy. Slick, followed by a warming puckering dryness from the alcohol.  Drinkability - Scary. 12% ABV? No way. Each sip enjoyable, complex. Savor this one.  Another winner created by Sam Calagione. Find this one (then drink it). Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,DavidSeanNJ,4.8,"This was one of the best beers I have had all year. Talk about beers with a high ABV that is almost completely undetectable...wow. Rich, complex, tasty, easy drinking.  A- Opaque dark liquid. Not black, but more brown than anything. Nice suttle tan head on top, some lace. This looks pretty as hell in my glass.  S- Woody as hell. I detected a huge fruit presence in the nose. Dark and juicy fruits to be exact. No alcohol smell whatsoever.  T- Wow. Flavor galore here, not for the faint. Those fruits showed up again with a nice dose of vanilla, chocolate, and dry figgy notes. The wood comes through here adding to the complexity and one of a kind taste. Malty goodness with a sweet quality but not overwhelming.  M- Sticky and oily with a full bodied presence. Perfect for this beer.  D- At 12% it just does not get any more drinkable than this. A sipper, but an easy and pleasurable one at that. Great job with this one DFH.  This is something to seek out. A special beer brewed by a special brewery. Masterful!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,jwc215,4.39,"Pours pitch black with an espresso-like head that quickly, immediately even, descends to a vanishing patch.  The smell is of char (peat-like), chocolate, toffee, molasses - plenty of complex dark malts - with dark fruits - grows even more complex with subsequent smells - this is a dark malt bomb, for sure, with vanilla added in.  The taste is of complex maltiness - where to begin... Chocolate, molasses, toffee with dark fruits/raisins. A peat/char smokiness balances the sweetness. As much of a malt bomb as this is, there is a balance to it, in a roasty/smoky way. Roasted coffe emerges more predominately as it nears the completion.  Creamy and full-bodied, this reminds me of melted ice cream in a way.  A wonderful - sipper? - 12% abv, would not have known. My guess would have been 6 to 7. Smooth, exciting and creative.

A- Poured into my New Belgium globe glass, this beer pours very dark brown with a light brown head that dissipates quickly, leaving almost no lacing on the glass.  S- A nice woody aroma with tons of dark fruits, dark chocolate, roasted and burnt malts, vanilla, coffee, and very noticeable alcohol. I start to notice some toffee and caramel in the aroma as the beer warms.  T- Flavors of roasted malts and dark fruits up front with vanilla and a mild coffee bitterness on the finish. The finish is dry, leaving no lingering flavors on the palate. There is also a slight woody flavor in the background. The alcohol is masked very well.  M- A thick and rich mouthfeel with mild carbonation.  D- The ABV is 12%, but the alcohol never gets in the way of enjoying this beer.  This is a truly unique and well-crafted Brown Ale.

It has some cherry and vanilla overtones to it. Alcohol smell present.  Like the NBA, this tastes fantastic! Tastes more like a stout that's not as thick. Vanilla tastes, hoppy tartness, sweet malts....  ...finishes with an oak taste.  Palo Santo means Holy tree, When I bought this beer, a burning bush tried to take the beer from me and drink it.

Lacing is thick at first but drops off fast.  S: Lots going on here. Cant believe Im saying this but you can really smell the wood. Very complex. Chocolate and vanilla, matched really well with the chocolate angel foodcake Im having along side. ABV is there.  T: It taste like some of the top notch dogfish stuff, not the ones that are overbearing. Roasted coffee and chocolate dominate the taste. Extremely sweet and malty and wood comes through here as well. Vanilla infused sugar and the alcohol became more present as it warmed. Interesting and complex, tremendous sipper.  M: Extremely thick and coating. The malts lie in the mouth and leave a dessert like film. No bubbles or fizz.  D: Not overbearing but the alcohol makes itself known. Strong flavors and a must try. One of the best sippers from DFH, did a whole lot but it all mixes together well.  Very highly recommended. Look forward to aging one of these for a bit.

10099,33832,merlin48,4.13,"12 oz bottle pours dark and opaque. Looks like a stout. Sturdy light brown head retains well and leaves some satiny rings and sheets of lacing on the glass.  Aroma is earthy, vanilla, caramel, and prominent dark roasty notes of burnt coffee and char.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick and creamy, with low medium carbonation.  Taste is pleasantly complex. Dark roasted malt bitterness is upfront with notes of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Pine hops lurk in the background. A spiciness almost like rye bread adds interest. Vanilla notes merge into an earthiness woodiness for additional complexity.  Alcohol is cleverly concealed but for some warming effects. This helps drinkability.

Molasses, caramel, and bread. Caramelized fruits such as bananas and pear comes to mind as well. Then the spiciness from the wood shines through. Cinnamon, clove, and black pepper flavors are present. The finish is roasty but still sweet. Lingering roasted aftertaste. Still tasty.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. This is a very nice beer drinkability takes a hit from the aftertaste and the ABV. I would recommend trying this very unique beverage.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,vurt,4.17,"Enjoyed on tap at Naja's Place in a 33 cL Amstel chalice. I think a wider-mouthed glass would enhance this beer better.  Appearance: Opaque brown-black, with intense red-orange highlights visible at the bottom of the glass. Dense medium-tan colored head recedes to a persistent collar of foam. Swirling the glass leads to lacing which dissipates rapidly, but the viscosity of this beer is evident.  Smell: You can tell the pedigree of some breweries right from the aroma. This beer smells like a Dogfish Head offering right from the get-go. Something in the sweetness and the particular funk of the malt. Under a sweet brown sugar note and an undertow of chocolate malted milk lurk dark stone fruits-- a plum note redolent of bittersweet chocolate and an afterimage of cherry and the skin of nectarines. There is also an aromatic cedar note, along with a prominent alcohol finish.  Taste: Yum! Woody milk chocolate backed by rich malt and a rye toast finish. There's an echo of lactic tartness which dissolves into a spicy, woody perfume, which then leads into succulent butterscotch and a light brown sugar note. The beer gets sweeter as the beer warms, but the rye toast character dries the finish. Alcohol and woody notes combine for a mildly numbing aromatic character that lingers.  Mouthfeel: The size of the carbonation is well matched to the medium-full body of the beer. Mouthfeel is luxurious but not nearly as heavy as you'd expect from a beer of this size.  Drinkability: The sweet malt and spicy aromatics make this a dauntingly more-ish beer. The alcohol quickly encourages you to sip sparingly. An excellent balance.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,BrewMonkey,3.74,"Pours very dark brown with a dense dark tan/chocolate head. Sticky lacing as the head recedes. Sweet alcohol aroma with faint chocolate and roasty malt notes.  Fairly roasty but smooth initial flavor coats the palate without being too thick or viscous. Subtle vanilla notes masked by the roasty/chocolaty and lightly coffee flavor. Not much wood really at first, though seems to surface more as the beer warms. Some faint fruity hop bitterness near the finish.  Very tasty, and while the alcohol is heavy on the nose, it's well hidden in the flavor. Good sipping beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Poured into a tulip glass, very dark brown or darker, with a medium sized tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, nuts, bread, hint of fruit and a general earthy woodiness. Rich flavor to match: roasted malt, notes of wood, caramel, coffee,and nuts with a lingering bittersweet molasses finish. That 12% alcohol is well hidden, but warms you up from the inside after you set down the glass. Big smile follows.

Smell: caramel, chcocolate, vanilla, and wood tones are pleasant and easy to detect.  Taste: follows the nose as the chocolates, caramels, prunes, vanilla, and an overall woody characteristic makes up a well balanced beer. Softer molasses tones arrive late. Some alcohol is also detectable here, but not overwhelming despite the ABV.  Mouhfeel: medium bodied beer. Lightly crisp at the start ad smoother towards the finish. Aftertaste is surprisingly brief.  Drinkability: nice flavor profile has you wanting multiple bottles of this, but the high ABV bringsthe desires back into check. Very enjoyable brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,belgiumking,4.62,"Poured an almost opaque brown black into a Belgian style goblet. High pour created a toffee colored tight head that cleared quickly.

Flavor is equally complex full of rich dark malt flavor, great hop offset, rich deep dark fruits, coffee, licorice,Vanilla bean, slight tannins from patent malt; rich alcohol luster with some fusil alcohol in exhale.  While this beer is 12%, it is well hidden in the complex nature of this beer.  This listing states that the beer is 'retired', but this is a new creation for Dogfish and they have invested $150,000 for 2 huge Palo Santo tuns to age this specialty beer in. So, 'retired' it is not.  Sam and his staff have pulled off another exceptional beer.  Note: This beer is not made to sit in the goblet for an extended period of time.

Molasses and brown sugar mingling with a woody (go figure) caramel and some chocolate. Alcohol is noticeable in the aroma.  T - Sweet malts are at the forefront delivering cocoa and brown sugar, developing in to a bitter chocolate and slight sour taste at the sides of the mouth. There's a bit of coffee at the finish and a definite alcohol burn.m I think this will only continue to improve. Would have given it even higher if not for the burn.  M - Thick and oily.

10099,33832,malty,4.5,"Bottled on 02-11-08 Served at 50F.  Pours into my tulip style stemmed glass BLACK with no highlighted edges. The head is creamy looking and loose with a khaki colored head. It stands sill and gorgeous with 1 1/2"" bragging inches. Smattered and spattered lacework all the way down.  Sweet roasted barley hits my nostrils first. Fresh dark bakers chocolate with a reminiscent whiff of my grandma's holiday candy dish. There's a ghostly sour cherry scent that wants to break through, but it's trying to hide (in vain though). A few more swirls evoke fresh malted milk with just a thin layer of alcohol warmth that tickles my nose.  Dazzling mixtures of sweet dark fruits with dark roasted malts, which comprise the sweet spectrum of this unique ale start the symphony. The chocolate ensemble makes its presence known by providing cocoa delight along with earthy notes just for good measure. Then the dry wood surfaces...A remarkable woody dryness slowly and steadily creeps into the picture and takes matters into its own hands. Sweet, fruity, chocolaty, malty, dry and long lasting.  Mouthfeel is quintessentially English; creamy and a little cask-like; 'flat' (but in a very good way). A little heavier than medium bodied with a flavorful long juicy, yet dry finish.  Drinkability is dangerously high. The 12% ABV is absolutely not at all detectable. This could make for some very interestingly hilarious drinking.  Overall a beer that blows my mind. The flavors are utterly complex but stay in the sweet/malty range. The Santo Palo wood is no gimmick. I admit to never tasting this wood before, but the wood flavor and transmitted texture is very apparent. The creamy, soft and low carbonated body makes it a satisfying and fulfilling ale to quaff (careful!!!). I'm 2/3 the way through my bottle and I can testify to feeling a little chest and (face) cheek warmth. Complex, unique and something to behold.

10099,33832,orbitalr0x,4.37,"Always good to see new Dogfish brews. Pours into my glass a deep dark brown that's bordering on black with a small tan head that lingers around for a bit. Quite a bit of viscosity in the pour. Aromas begin with deep nutty malts mixing with roasted notes. Hints of vanilla, earthiness and spice move in as well. Caramel and molasses notes are there along with a subtle coffee and fruitiness. Wood afterthoughts. Quite complex!  First sip brings a nice roasted, nutty dark caramelized malt flavor upfront with toast, coffee and molasses accents. As it flows down I get some vanilla, brown sugar and spice along with a distinctive earthy aspect. A bit sweet, but never cloying. There's a woody flavor here but it's well integrated and more on the mellow side. It finishes off with a touch of bitterness on the back of the palate. Fruit suggestions are there as well. No sign of the alcohol anywhere. Damn good brew.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a solid medium body. Nice mellow carbonation makes this an easy drinker. The 12% is not at all noticeable, making this one almost too drinkable. A few of the other big abv Dogfish beers have a syrupy sweetness in my opinion, however the Palo Santo does not at all.

S- Smells like dark wood chips, bourbon, brown sugar, caramel and vanilla.  T- Dark roasted malts, lots of brown sugar and sweet candy with hints of caramel and vanilla. Very little hops in this one. Reminds me of the Dogfish Indian Brown Ale on steroids. Fantastic.  M- Extremely smooth, silky and creamy. Coats the mouth with a sugary pleasantness.  D- Smooth enough to hide the ultra powerful 12 percent ABV to the point that it is barely noticeable.

It pours more like a stout than anything.  Smell is rich, with coffee being the dominant aroma, with some hints of chocolate and caramel as well. Flavor is more of the same. Coffee, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, a bit of wood from the vessel it was aged in, and a bit of heat from the alcohol. This is a damn fine brew - more a stout than a brown ale though.

Some background blackberry and vanilla. The flavor returns after the swallow where some light hop becomes apparent.

They may call it a brown, but it looks like a stout; still pretty sexy. Aromas are signature DFH, sweet, sticky candy and fusel alcohols! Digging deeper, I can get some slightly roasty malts, chocolate, vanilla, and yes, some oak; but it's not overdone. It's a very fresh cut wood smell like you would get in a carpentry shop, really nice. On the palate, this beer just blooms. Flavors are much more brown like. There's just a touch of roasted malt, not unlike most American Browns, some caramel, fruity esters with a slightly watery finish. Despite the ABV, this beer is quite drinkable. DFH often struggles with these high gravity beers, but this one truly shines. The finish is more roasted bitterness and just shy of being dry. Carbonation is low and mouthfeel is quite heavy. It is really an extreme beer and I can't wait to see what DFH has in store next.

The body was dark brown coming out of the bottle, but in the glass, it looked pretty black. The head was quite large and settled down to a three plus finger layer of craggy foam. The smell was quite nondescript for a beer with such a complex origin. All I could smell was a little toffee, chocolate, and chicory. The taste was much more typical of wood barrel aged beers than the smell. I got a dash of vanilla, some sweet gummy flavors, a little chocolate, and a sour finish. I was somewhat disappointed that the alcohol was not hidden at all. I think this has some rough edges still which beg to be smoothed out by more aging. The mouthfeel was creamy and oily and the body was a little thicker than I was anticipating.

Surprised to see how dark this is, looks like an RIS. Very black with a cocoa colored head that disappears very quickly, leaves no lace. Not very brown looking to me.  So the smell is sweet and very boozy, smells good but isn't very unique. Some chocolate and roasted malts coming through, and they come much more to the forefront on the taste. I didn't really get any sense of the woody taste, not really sure what to look for. Enough hops in here to balance out the sweetness. It tasted good, but not really very unique. Mouthfeel was medium, not quite full enough for the beer at hand. Drinkability is good, but not great. Maybe i am just missing this one completely, i don't really get what everybody sees in this one, and I love dogfish head.

The aroma is sweet fudgy chocolate and some wood, coffee and alcohol.  The flavor is baking chocolate, vanilla and fudge and a slight hint of fruits followed by a slightly bitter, strongly alcoholic finish.

Even swirling brings only a bit of it back. Aromas are most heavily of sugar and wafts of auslese like alcohol that I have come to associate with big DFH beers. Drinks very smoothly, with no evident carbonation. Smokey tastes coming from this one, along with burnt carmel. Some coffee notes as well. Remeinds me more of a stout than anything else - Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti comes to mind. However, this is sweeter - not at all cloying though. Bitterness provides a balance, but that is all.

This beer poured a VERY dark brown (damn near black) with a small light-brown head which quickly dissolved, leaving a nice ring and small thin layer of bubbles. The nose is very sweet with alcohol creeping through. Some fruity notes also appear. I had this in the fridge for a couple of days, but the aroma really started to shine when it warmed up a bit. Very roasty and chocolatey on the first taste, with a nice warming feeling due to the high alcohol content. The brew has a fruity after taste that sticks around, but is quite pleasant. For being so incredibly dark of a beer, it wasn't as heavy as I was anticipating.

10099,33832,ATPete,4.32,"So my store was allocated 1 case of the Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron, I was smart in picking up my 4 pack on Friday morning as soon as it was delivered. It turns out the rest of the case sold later that day...  (into my 33cl Chimay glass)  The Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron has a very floral nose of coffee, creamy vanilla, caramel, toffee with an added touch of spice. The brew pours a deep brown colour with attractive tan/red highlights. I got zero head retention from my pour (the bottled on date of only February 11th might have something to do with that). Beginning with touches of wood and malts and finshing with great subtle fruitiness, vanilla and nice touch of bitterness, this beer is very complex. The booming 12% alcohol content is definitely apparent in the midst of all the harmonious flavors but is in no way threatening or overpowering. Great tannins from the fruity character really make way for a long pleasant finish.  I've really enjoyed the Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron. If you see this around be sure to drop the 15 bucks for a 4 pack. Try one, and let the other 3 sit. Thats what i'll be doing!

Odor is of strong fermented molasses along with raisins dates a little bit of smokey wood. Taste, at first, is a combo between a wee heavy and a sweet stout, with sugary, almost watery peat flavors. smokiness and vanilla comes through next, drying out the mouth. A definite alcohol presence, but tempered somewhat by the smokey flavor. Comes out overall more like a porter than a brown ale, imo, but it also sort of isnt trying to be any one style, i dont think. Wood gets a bit tannin-y and bitter towards the end, but not too badly. Medium bodied, surprizingly so. The first of these big dogfish head beers i've had that wasn't cloying and syrupy and all together hard to drink. Actually its hard to pick out all that alcohol in here. quite a nice drinking beer.

It's dark - thick tan head that reclines into a thin layer. There's a woodsy smell and very malty and sweet. I smell some smoke too.  It warms my throat as I finish each sip. Very malty - a hint of cherry or dark berries, even raisins (?), chocolate, touch of hops, but woodsy like burnt oak. Roasty and smoky without being charred or too strong.  This is an insanely complex beer and truly unique. This isn't my favorite style but I respect the hell out of this beer and the quality and uniqueness is evident.

Nice to see the decision that I yearned for, that is to turn it into a production beer. Looks deep dark mahogany with barely any ruby highlights when held toward the light large mocha tan head forms thick and takes it's time dying down even with double digit abv that's good retention not too mention the lacing that forms in even thick patches with each sip. Aromatics are full of raisin tartness with a sharp sweet brandy note about it, complex as all hell with a lively herbal incense like quality sweet brown sugar caramelized and drizzled over it all. Maybe just a touch of anise or some other herbal quality arising from the hop profile. Flavors blend so well with smoky, earthy, and woody tones all playing off one another. Mild medicinal alcohol presence but sweet dark roasted malts and caramelized sugars dominate the flavor base, deep fruit accents round it all out with more exotic spiciness kicking. Completely original nothing else to compare this brew to an experience every craftbeer drinker should try to obtain. Body is full with sticky residual sugars given it a light syrup texture even slow churned carbonation bubbles arising, really finishes with a smoky cigar box like note. Drinkability is excellent your 12 oz portion will be gone before you realize it, yes I know 12% it's hard to tell really blended well and aged to perfection here. I can't wait to try more brews aged in the new wooden tanks. This beer really helps regain Dogfish Head some of the credibility that it had for so long.

Even though I've had some crazy DFH brews that I enjoyed but wasn't nuts about, I'm always willing, like many out there, to spend the money to try more. Poured into a Thomas Hardy's snifter at room temperature.  Appearance: An opaque deep brown, with hints of amber when you tip it toward the light near the top. Small hints of lacing and a head that billows and folds more quickly than I wanted.  Smell: Unfortunately the whiffs alcohol, though not unpleasant, seem to mask a bit of what I wish I was taking in. There's certainly the wood aromas, roasted malt, some pine (not sure from the wood or the hops), nuts, bread, and hints of fruit. Still balanced and pretty wild overall, but I was hoping there would be more.  Taste: There's a frightening amount of complexity in this brew when it comes to tasting it, though, with roasted malts, sour cherries, citrus zest, dark berries, different fruit from the malt complexity (some banana is evident, with hints of raspberry), huge complexity from the palo santo (which I'm sure I'm not even close to sensing all of it), dates, nuts, bread, sap, molasses, raisins, scotch, charcoal, smoke, vanilla. Finishes semi-dry initially, into some citrus, an odd roasted sweetness, and a long lingering roasted malt backbone with some oddly intriguing citrus hops, making one unique and lip-smacking brew. Insane and wonderful all around.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full-bodied with a huge velvety profile, perfect carbonation hitting enough for the flavors to come through but not enough to mask anything. Coating and enveloping without being sticky, letting the flavors do their thing.  Drinkability: A lot of love went into this beer. Even though I thought the DVD was great and enhanced my whole experience (not to mention DFH gets an additional thumbs up for using The Books for the open and close tune), this is a great and unique brew. Balanced, rich, flavorful, lingering, and top notch all around. Completely singular and worth the $12 or so for the 4-pack. Pick some up if you can find it.

10099,33832,mikesgroove,4.15,"I made up a special trip up to Asheville to pick up this one when it came out as I knew it was going to be one I would like, well at least I hoped it would be. I mean c'mon what is there not to like about barrel aged imperial brown ales, from Dogfish none the less. So anyway, I put one in the fridge the other day and when I got home last night I decided it was going to be the time to open this as a good night cap. I let it warm up a bit to a comfortable 55 degrees and poured it into my Rodenbach snifter. The pour was very dark, extremely dark brown with a slight burgundy tint to it. Completely opaque, with no light coming through even when held up to the light, remarkable. No head at all, well let me rephrase that, there was a touch of tan colored foam on the top but it quickly faded leaving it wide open, very interesting, and a little different then what I was expecting.    The aroma was very rich and sweet. A mild alcohol warming coming through on it, but not much, which was a touch surprising given the percentages involved here. Lots of weird oak-like, or maple-like, some kind of wood like smell coming of this, but hard to describe. Hints of caramel and earthy malts permeating down through it really bringing out some depth. Now some really nice dark fruit like tone, not sure what to call it, but really nice, almost like a weird raisin, spice and odd sort of mix. When I took a sip I was amazed at how smooth this was. A rich medium bodied awaited me with tons of creamy carbonation. This was incredible, as for being so strong, the alcohol was a mere afterthought. Tons of wood flavor were all over this and really quite nicely done to be honest. Really great flavors of light grass in the background mixing around with a good amount of spices. Hints of maple and cinnamon way in the back and a nice raisin like fruitiness. Very dark and deep. Tons of caramel sweetness and a really great malt profile here. The finish was very strong, with lots of drying. Nice long lasting flavor towards the end as well with a really well balanced profile and a really great bit of balance. For something that was so big it was remarkably drinkable as the alcohol was more of an accent then a hindrance. Very well blended and just a great sipper.    Overall I was more then happy with this release. This has to be one of my favorite of the big Dogfish Head releases. It was really quite mellow and unique with just a great balanced flavor. The wood aging really mellowed this out and it shows. I would love to drink this again, and I plan on going to pick up more as soon as I can. I would really have to recommend this one to anyone who is a fan of big creations or wood aging. It is tremendously well done and refined, and one of the best things I have scene come out of Dogfish in a long time.

10099,33832,errantnight,4.47,"Easily one of my highest rated beers on here... and I think I might be short-changing it just a tad... for what they were trying to accomplish, this might be perfect.  Pours a rich, deep, dark dark dark brown, only exposing itself as truly mahogany towards the very end. Moderate lacing and thin head.  Rich and malty, toasty, oak and vanilla and chocolate/cocoa... delicious.  Taste is.... well... first of all, where's the alcohol? It's clearly full and rich... but it's just not there. Vanilla and chocolate again, the tannins are more rounding and softening than puckering, but they sit on the cheeks while the tongue is caressed by a velvety but just ever so slightly prickly malt sweetness. There are no huge and dominant flavors here, just layers of rich subtlety.  If I have any complaint, it's only that it sits a bit sweet on the tongue, particularly after having finished my glass (I used a Chimay goblet).  I'm not sure anyone else could have made this beer... who else but Dogfish Head is able to produce such insanely rich and strong beers of such subtlety and grace?  I simply must purchase a 4 pack for extended cellaring, and perhaps a bit more for the meantime... if there was a beer to convert people to high alcohol beers, this would have to be it, I think.

Quite a bit of subtle complexity; I've had this a couple of times now and I'm still not entirely sure how to describe it. A nice toasty bitterness in the finish balances the initial sweetness.

The head is dark tan and fades to a thin film after a short while in the glass.  There is quite a bit happening on the nose. Brown sugar, chocolate, coffee, root beer, ginger, eucalyptus and chicory (which is odd because I doubt they put any chicory in here). A lot of what I don't understand in here, I'm chocking up to the palo santo wood, but not sure if that's correct. Regardless, this is a very interesting beer.  Taste is singular and complex, with a lot more going on than even the nose would suggest. Confusing but not overbearing. It has the profile of a classic Old Ale due to the high amount of added dark sugars, but the herbal/woody flavors shift the whole thing just to the left of that.

Pours a deep dark brown color that reminds me of semisweet chocolate. It's actually still a brown color, rather than the black color you might expect. Carbonation's there and isn't bad for something at 12% ABV. Smells like a kicked up version of their Indian Brown Ale, but boozier and with a little bit of a smoky flavor in there, too. It actually tastes like a beer that isn't nearly as strong as it is. Much like the smell, it's like a 2X version of the Indian Brown Ale. I'm not picking up a ton of traditional wood flavors, but more of an earthiness and some nuttiness that's closer to Brazil nuts. Hops are there as expected, but they're there in a support role. Texture is thick and creamy. Reminds me a little of a nitro texture, just because of the way that everything is sort of fluffy. Drinkability's higher than you might expect, but there's a little bit of heat in there once you work your way down.  I'm not really getting a lot from the wood, but I love the texture and the concept of a brown ale on steroids.  I might have to get more of this!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Lupe,4.8,"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with lighter brown hues when held up to light. Huge soapy tan head that lasted for a while before settling down. Loads of sticky lace cling to the sides of the glass. All this head and lace with 12% abv?! A little sediment found it's way into the glass.  Malty aroma with a generous dose of dusty yeast. Molasses, maple syrup, and cocoa, along with roasted malt and faint vanilla. Alcohol is very present in the aroma - this could spell trouble.  Wow - were did the alcohol go. Barely noticeable in the flavor. Surprisingly smooth and mellow and not as sweet as expected. Roasted coffee and chocolate, some nuttiness, caramel and molasses. A touch of vanilla, raisin, and wood. Not to steal from a fellow reviewer, but there is a very pleasant ""burnt pizza crust"" flavor towards the end. Again there is just barely a hint of alcohol. With all the mellowing and melding of flavors, the wood really must be holy. Most similar to a good aged English Barelywine in flavor.  Medium-full in body. Thinner than expected, but in a good way. Incredibly smooth and creamy, but not thick, syrupy, or cloying. Awesome beer - a sipper that drinks way too easily. Excellent - try if you can.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Poured a blackish brown color ( it looks black but when pouring the stream from the bottle to glass was more on the brown color) with a mocha colored head. Smell is mixture of the malt, carmel, yeast, and the wood aroma. Taste is vanilla, carmel, dark fruit, with slight coco flavor. Mouthfeel is great with a fullbody syrup mouthfeel without being to sweet and a nice low carbonation level. This beer is extremely drinkable for 12% with great full flavor.

Aromas are classic brown ale, but kicked up a bit. Fruity, almost raisin like, dusty, and woody.  This is actually quite smooth and mellow, especially for a beer that checks in at 12%. Subtle wood flavors, classic brown ale flavors, nutty, earthy, creamy, and a tad bit sweet as well. Finish is crisp, with just a hint of the alcohol.  Beer has good mouthfeel and surprising carbonation.  Drinkability is surprisingly very good. This is a very well crafted and interesting beer that is actually VERY easy to sip.

Smells of coffee and chocolate with sweet malts and a little vanilla. Tasted of coffee with some earthy wood tones and a slight bitterness and tart bite.

SMELL: Vanilla, bourbon, coffie, chocolate, its got a great fragrance.  TASTE: mmm...lots of rich/burnt/grainy goodness. Lots of chocolate up front with a little coffie, vanilla and oak round it out for me. The 12% alcohol is totally hidden.  Mouthfeel: By far the best bodied beer I've had in a long time. This thing has the mouthfeel of an oatmeal stout on steroids. Thick, syrupy, creamy, it lingers on your palate.  Drinkability: This stuff is great. Very rich in flavor, definately not a session brew, but I could sip my way through a few on a relaxing evening with good friends.

Had a small, light brown head that left no lacing around the glass.  Aroma was wood, vanilla, heavy malt, caramel and dark fruits.  Taste was smoked wood, tobacco, vanilla, caramel, molasses and light maple.  Soft, creamy texture. Excellent at cellar or even room temperature.  I had been avoiding this one. I originally thought it was just going to be a standard brown ale. I should have known that Sam and the DFH crew wouldn't brew a traditional brown ale for a special release. I'm glad I was able to track this down. It's an awesome beer. I plan to lay a few down in the cellar to see how they change over time.  I also like the idea of releasing a DVD with the beer. Haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but it's a great idea and will hopefully provide some insight into the idea behind the beer and working with the wood fermentors. Definitely worth tracking down.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Aroma of coffee, chocolate and nuts. Taste is like the aroma, but with some woody notes and dark fruits. Full-bodied and smooth; goes down well. A bit of tingle from the invisible carbonation.

10099,33832,sjohansen,4.67,"Pours on the darker side of a brown ale. Almost opaque. Thin mocha head fizzles quickly leaving little lacing or remnants of its presence.  Large malt dominance in the nose. It's hard to explain the notes that I assume are from the wood. It has similar characteristics to brews aged in oak barrels, although sweeter without the hints of whiskey.  There is a sweet vanilla characteristic on the front of the palate. It gets more prevalent as the beer warms. Slightly bitter on the sides, but smoothed out by a brown sugar aftertaste. The bottle says 12%, but I find no pepper or heat from the alcohol. Everything is just smooth, sweet and malty.  Thick-creamy-rich mouthfeel.  Everything about this one is unique. The wood gives sweet characteristics that complement the roastiness of the malts well in the nose as well as the taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Smell is rich cocao malts with coffee hints and a slight burn from the yeast. No alcohol is detectable by aroma. Taste is all over the place here. First you get this heavy coffee/cocoa heavy as thick molassass then a fruity flavor hits the tip of the tongue. Then the flavor goes quickly to the mellow malt sweetness of a choclolat bar then the alcohol is at the very end with a mellow warmth in the back of the throat. Mouthfeel is just a tad oily but very clean otherwise. You really can't feel the alcohol here till the very end of the aftertaste. Good stuff here.

Palo Santo Marron pours a dark caramel color, very stout-like, with almost an inch of tanned foam.  I can pick up the wood notes almost immediately; a very soft, earthy and grain-like aroma coming from the wood ageing. There's also hints of chocolate, toffee, roasted malts, a bit of coffee, hazelnut, nutty malts, toasted multi-grain bread, and the slightest touch of spices.  Lots of chocolate, wood and coffee flavors on the first sip, really enjoyable. Then there are some hints of dark fruits like sweet raisins and plums along with the roasted malts and finishes with a little alcohol warmth.  Carbonation could be a little smoother but some ageing might take care of that.

Those others I mentioned...not so much.  Appearance of this was a dark red-black color. Head was tan and interacted strangely with my glass, as if it were trying to eat through it. Aroma was extremely roasty with lots of great ""burned pizza crust"" character. Flavor was also very roasty, but had an extremely floral note and some red wine grapiness also. Most really roasty beers are just that; it takes a lot of flavor to balance with some fruit.

I'm talking lando calrisian mooching on princess leia smooth... so yeah, it's smooth. the typical brown flavor asserts itself more on the second sip. alcohol ? This sucker hides the poison well.. you get some burn in the tum tum but that is about all you sense.  verdict? an absolutely pleasant beer to drink. worth the price ? er.. I don't know about that. I don't taste this and go ""I absolutely have to get this!"" or recommend it as such. But, that said, Sam and crew are going out on a limb that isn't covered by 42 hop varieties.

10099,33832,brewjones,3.78,"So, it seems as if Sam Calagione is at it again. He really does take the homebrew spirit and throw it into the commercial world with what seems to be an unlimited imagination and budget.  Says it is a Brown Ale. Sure, I would agree. Pours a dark mahogany with a tan head that is creamy and doesn't last very long. There is a huge fruity nose filled with raisins and vanilla. No hop presence yet. At first sip it is very smooth and easy to drink. No hop character, all malt. There is a slight tartness that portrudes and is a bit unpleasant at first but doesn't linger but turns into a warmth in the belly that is right for this time of year (if it wasn't almost 60 today).  I would say this is a good one but not as easy drinking as I had hoped. The wood is present although I am not sure how different it is from any other wooden vessel. Supposedly these are 10,000 (yes ten thousand) gallon wooden vessels made from the Paraguayan wood (Palo Santo). Reported as the largest wooden cask since before prohibition. Ok - I don't know.  Got mine at the Firehouse Liquors (that dude has some good ones) and he is selling 4 packs for $16.99 and singles for $4.95. I bought two so I could try one and cellar one for at least a year to see how they differ. Maybe longer. Supposedly it says you can age this one for up to 8 years.

10099,33832,Gueuzedude,3.8,"Bottle Date February 2008; Sampled February 2008 Pours with an almost three-finger thick, light brown colored head. The beer is a deep, burnt amber, dark brown colored head. Despite being a clear, rich brown color as I pour this beer, it is completely opaque when held up to the light. Aromas of vanilla, interesting spicy wood that is not the same as from oak (slightly peppery, cinnamon and a touch of fenugreek), candied caramel malt, almost a bit of smoke, . A substantial fruit character provides notes of cherries, raisins and red grapes mixes very well with the wood aromatics. The alcohol is hidden quite well, especially given the 12% abv. Supporting, toasty malt notes, with ample browned bread and biscuit notes and a hint of roast character; really the toasty, browned bread crust like aromas of this beer are quite distinct if you dig around in the aroma for them. This has a very interesting aroma, the use of the Palo Santo wood definitely adds a unique dimension that is a derivative, but still uniquely distinct from, the more typical oak.  Thick and viscous, though not nearly as sweet as I was expecting. A creamy, velvety mouthfeel couples with flavors of vanillin, chewy toffee and dark fruit flavors. This is pretty well carbonated (with a nice prickle to the tongue at the beginning of each sip), but it is thick enough that it is not noticed as much as it would be otherwise. Concentrated fruit forward flavors of cherries, raisins and blackberries couple with a very light alcohol presence to contribute a Brandy like finish. This finishes with a toasted soda cracker note at times, but often this takes the backseat to the sweet, concentrated fruit notes that tend to linger on in the mouth. The wood components are a bit more subdued than in the aroma; it does provide a spicy backbone as well as a bit of tannic astringency, both of which provide a sharp note in the finish that provides balance like hop bitterness would.  As the beer warms up a bit, the aroma really starts to pick up a complex mix of cherry, mace, and distinctly sweet spices. The aroma of this brew is a bit more intriguing and interesting than the flavor, though that is by no means a dud. The malt and brown ale character seems to come through more in the aroma as does the wood. With the added wood component this is one of the more complex, even balanced big beers from Dogfish Head.

A nice chocolaty, nutty flavor with a hearty helping of malt, sweetness, and berry-like esters. Good hopping rates give the beer a grassy, piney flavor while offsetting the heavy sweetness. The wood gives a well-roundness to the flavors, but don't give a whole lot of wood flavor or astringency. Quite delicate in it's balance, despite a dominant alcohol (ethanol)taste and slightly harsh textures, but does thin the weighted brew a bit. Surprised to see a fizzy head formation that didn't last any time at all, nor did the carbination -- strange for DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,ATLbeerDog,4.4,Poured dark brown almost black with a tint of red from a 12oz. bottle. 1/8 inch tan head. Aroma of heavy malt with a scent of wine. Tastes sweet then bitter with a hint of vanilla. Mouthfeel is very creamy. Closer to a Baltic Porter than a Brown Ale. The 12% percent is well hidden. This is a great beer. I'd love to have this on tap!  The four pack came with a DVD glued to the side. I almost didn't see it.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,pwoods,4.55,"12oz. brown bottle, purchased at Dilly Deli, poured into a snifter. Dating is smudged but it looks like 1/12/08.  A: Pours a very deep chocolate brown that's completely opaque. Maybe an inch of head struggles to forms after a semi rough pour and dies within a minute or 2. Some thin lacing rings.  S: Intense aroma. Plenty of woody alcohol and vanilla notes. Super sweet, bready malts that make me think that I'm gonna have to chew through this one :)  T/M: Wow, very tasty. Super beefed up American brown. Sweet caramel malts(though not as sweet as I would have thought they'd be) with a subtly growing malted milk ball flavor that peaks at balancing right at the end. A bit smoky, a bit peaty, and plenty of earthy, woody notes. The alcohol plays very nice around the tongue and warms the throat and belly. Body is nearly full and it has just enough carbonation to add a silkiness.  D: It doesn't get much more drinkable for a 12% brew. If I had much more, I'd have another but I want to save and savor these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

In case you weren't aware of this, a film was included on DVD with the $15 four-pack.  The beer is opaque. Strong as hell. Sweet. Full of character. One of the ten best beers I have ever drank.  I can't wait to age these (that sounds dumb). I will get more to drink now as well. Last summer I made a pilgrimage ot Rehoboth Beach.

It is also a bit smokey and woody. Reminds of of the nose of Angel's Share.  T- I taste coffee, alcohol, chocolate, raisin, and smokey woody notes. Definitely not a normal brown ale.  M- good carbonation, with a medium thick viscosity.  D- This is a nice strong brown ale.

It is served in the 8 oz. snifter and pours a deep dark brown to black with a little amber quality. The smell is very earthy and very sweet with some chocolate notes and the dark roasted malts. The taste is very good but unusual. You can definitely taste the wood in the beer. It is described as an epic brown ale and it does just that. The mouthfeel is pretty thick and a little creamy. The drinkability hurts a little due to the weight and size of this beer.

The appearance was impressive for a 12% abv. it had a decent size head with some patchy lacing. The nose had rich woodsy smell with dark fruity undertones. The taste was really smooth for being so high in alcohol,which gave the brew a sherry like quality. Caramelized apples and light notes of sherrywood and spice really add to the complexity. The mouthfeel was solid but not extremely silky for being oak aged. The drinkabilty is great for a night cap!

You may think, i thought this was a brown ale i got myself into... prepare to be intrigued.  S - Faint woodsy aroma... not overpowering but an aroma that really contributes to each sip. Caramelized malt pair with a faint aroma of rum raisin, roasted malt and a slightly spicey finishing hop... vanguard maybe?  T - Layers of flavor. Caramelized malt, layered with a smokey woodsy flavor turns into a roasted phenomenon. Dark chewy malts leave behind a slightly warm tone of alcohol.  M - this brew is smooth. Make sure this is a sipper...  D - Get out your finest glass, serve slightly warm and call it a nightcap. Thats what im doing right now. This beer is wonderful.

10099,33832,CWiggins,4.05,"I first tasted this beer in the Rehoboth Beach brewpub back in October of '06. After a long day of driving, this was the first beverage I tasted; it was the prelude to a well-prepared and well-deserved meal. And it couldn't have been a more pleasant sipping experience. Upon hearing that Dogfish Head would be bottling this precious concoction, I nearly leapt for joy; the waitress at the brewpub informed me that this was a once-only brew that would be gone forever within a week's time. Now it makes an appearance in North Carolina; I happened across it tonight at Sam's Quik Stop in Durham and couldn't even consider purchasing any other beer until I get this out of my system.  (Let me say before the review that I don't really expect this to be the exact same beer I had previously. The alcohol is 2% lower, and I'm sure there will be differences in the on-tap vs. bottled versions.)  This brew pours pitch black with a short-lived, dark tan head. (Its appearance is very akin to a Russian Imperial Stout.) Light aromas of dark roasted malts, along with sweet dried fruit and vanilla waft up from the surface. It's not a very intense aroma; actually, I expected more.  The thick and creamy mouthfeel give way to flavors of dark sweet chocolate malts (especially on the front), vanilla, light sweet dried fruit, strong coffee, and a mild smokiness I imagine was imparted by the Palo Santo barrels. There's a heck of a lot going on here, and the best way to experience it is through a not-too-cold tasting. As it warmed the flavors became even more intense and the balance shifted slightly. I wish it weren't quite so carbonated, but that's a pet peeve I have with too many ales to complain too bitterly!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,Freshie,3.85,"Interesting one.  Dark mahogany color. Tan head one finger head.  Aroma is sweet. With a real woody-earthy undertone.  Taste is sweet upfront. Vanilla, Molasses, hints of chocolate. Spicy and light hop character in the middle. Woody aftertaste prevails as you drink.  A good ale, but the woody nature of the brewing process, and the high ABV overpower the sweeter characters of the flavour. Which is fine with me, but may make this one harder to down for some.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,jimbomill,4.26,"This is a new DFH Craft Brewery product for me. I consider their IPA 120, WWS, Raison D'Extra and Olde School ""best in class"" contenders. I've much less American Brown Ale experience under my belt. The appearance was dark, more brown-black than reddish, all from my pour into my DFH Craft Brewery Ales brandy snifter. The nose was new to me. Muddy earth tones come to mind. It was not as pleasing as many other beers' fragrances, so I may have been generous at 3.5. The taste very nice - but more ""new"" than anything else, reminding me of pork BBQ - maybe that's the special wood peaking through. The mouthfeel was solid, not overpowering and not thin - this is just right, like the third try by Goldilocks. Drinkability is also given high marks. On an absolute scale, the abv is high at 12%, but compared to other DFH stable mates, its on the low side.  I'm glad I scarfed up the last few 4-packs I could find around here in South Jersey. I found a bonus - on the 4-pack itself was a DVD where the folks at DFH explain what went ito the making of this brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Nice and creamy dark khaki colored head that recedes and leaves a thick and bubbly ring in its' wake.  S: Delicious smells of vanilla, brown sugar, chocolate, cherry, and a bit of resin-y wood.  T: Dark fruit, spice, vanilla, carmelized brown sugar, dark chocolate, toffee, cherry, wood, blackened malt, molassas, and caramel glazed bread pudding. Yum.  M: Sticky and coating. Slightly thinner than I expected, but that made this drink like a beer with 1/2 of this ones' 12% abv.  D: Very good.

10099,33832,pershan,4.57,"I have to disagree in calling this a brown ale. First of all, the beer poured a thick, black color with a thin, dark head into a 12-oz pilsner glass. The smell was of caramel, currants, roasted malt, and just a hint of vanilla. The appearance and smell were more in line with a stout (an Imperial stout, I guess, due to the 12% ABV). The initial taste was of sweet caramel malt, thick and viscous, transitioning into a very full-bodied toasted malt and alcohol finish - very ""stout-ish"". Very smooth and balanced for a 12% ABV brew - possibly the smoothest high alcohol beer I've ever had. I can't honestly say I could pick out the contribution the Palo Santo wood made to the beer, but this is a great brew nonetheless, even if the style categorization seems to be wrong.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
10099,33832,prototypic,4.28,"Appearance: Brown ale? Wow. It's jet black from my perspective. Very generous creamy, tan two and a half finger head. Excellent retention and lacing.  Smell: Roasted malts roll off the top. There's some toasted nut, hints of dark fruit, and chocolate aromas added to the mix. Very light espresso or coffee smell. Alcohol is masked pretty well, but is noticeable. Very faint spicy and hop aromas on the tail.  Taste: Roasted and chocolate malts are most prevalant. It is sweet and a bit spicy. Toasted nut and plum flavors mix well. Very light espresso taste. Light hops provide just the right amount of bitterness. It has a bit of a smoked flavor to it (could be the wood effect). Alcohol is not very noticeable in taste.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and extremely smooth. Carbonation is excellent. It is strong at 12%. I probably wouldn't drink more than one or two in a sitting. But, it's extremely drinkable. Definitely not hard to put away. Overall, this is a damn fine beer. Very unique.

10099,33832,GilGarp,4.48,"I bought this one on the raving review given by my local liquor store beer guru. Expectations were high before I even got home.  Poured in a tulip glass. It had a very little, lacy, bone white head which disappeared quickly.  The beer was much darker than I would have imagined for a brown ale. No light passes through this one.  On a blind taste test I would have called it an imperial porter. It has the sweetness of vanilla at first but a surprisingly dry finish, perhaps because of the alcohol content.  Speaking of which, I notice the warmth in my belly after just a few small sips.  This is an intensely special beer and one should take the time to enjoy it. Like most Dogfish Head brews, it's expensive but worth a try. Next time I have one, it will be at cellar temp. I hope this will bring out more of the subtle flavors.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

Head retention and lacing are both OK. The aroma is great and very unique. I assume the stronger part of the aroma (since it's something that's not familiar to me) is from the Palo Santo wood. I can also smell some vanilla, toffee, and cream. The taste of this beer is just all over the place. With each sip it seems like I can taste something different. I can taste wood, chocolate, toffee, vanilla, roasted malt, molasses, coffee, dark fruit and little bit of booze. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy, coating and a little bit slick. Drinkability is pretty good too, it's smooth and it doesn't seem like a beer that's 12% ABV. I don't think I could drink more than a couple of these at a time, but it's very enjoyable.

10099,33832,satowns,4.1,"Bottled on 2/11/08  PS Marron pours completely opaque with a quickly receding head of dark brown. I guess I didn't check this bottle in the light. I was expecting a beer of deep brown or auburn. What a surprise!  Vanilla bean and alcohol fill the initial waves of aroma. Some whipping cream in there somewhere. Smells like an amazing butter cream desert. I get a little toffee in the end. I have no idea what Palo Santo smells like, but I don't get any traditional woodiness in the nose.  Wow! I don't know where to start, except that you don't get any of the 12% abv in the flavor! Extremely complex flavor components. Chocolate, green grape, vanilla, sweet Bing cherry. Amazingly easy drinking.  Beautiful body, great mouthfeel.  This is a great strong ale. Flavors melt together well to form a rich and complex deliciously tasting experimental ale. I admire the spirit of DFH because they stick to the essence of why we advocates of beer drink the beer we do; to experience new flavors. They are mega scale home brewers because they are not afraid to try something new. I have had several DFH beers that I did not like, but there wasn't a beer that I didn't enjoy. Its all about the experience; and trying something new and outside your comfort zone is a major factor.

10099,33832,DefenCorps,4.32,"Original review: Reviewed on: 02-23-2008 02:04:24  12oz bottle poured into my Duvel tulip at near cellar temp. Bottled all of 11 days back!  A: Brown ale? Heck this is black with a thin dark tan head. Appealing on this winter night  S: Unique. It's got caramel, toffee, roasted nuts but it's also got this wonderful smell that's quite distinct - a sweetish, spicy aroma that i guess is from the wood. Very good  T: This is like a Scorsese movie - long, twisting and enthralling. Starts off with some caramel and chocolate malt, turns sweet and then all of a sudden, becomes rather dry and then the hops kick in. Mildly done for a DFH beer but well in balance here. The finish is dry with a definitely woody taste to it.  M: Very good - not too light, not too heavy, not too slick - it's got it all together  D: One and done - that's all you need but what did you expect from a 12%abv beer?  Try it at least once - it's interesting!  **Edit: 31 July 2010.** I've had this over two years now, and my palate's changed a LOT since I last had this. The nose is excellent, with a blend of vanilla, a light woody character, a little incense and some caramel. As it warms up, the wood grows, but is unique, very perfumey and quite like sandalwood in some respects. With some cocoa to round out the nose, this smells excellent. The palate opens with a spicy, woody character, with the caramel and little cocoa working very well with it. In some ways, it's like a heavily but slowly caramelized loaf of pumpernickel bread with a dusting of caraway on top. A touch tannic on the finish, this helps balance out the moderate sweetness that's present. The chocolate character really comes through mid-palate, quite cocoa-like. The finish is quite excellent, with a nice, lingering woody spice character. Alcohol is quite spectacularly hidden, this is an excellent beer, one I wish I'd drunk more of. D+.5  **Edit 15 Oct 2014** My last bottle of batch 1. 6 Years!  Age has softened and smoothed this beer, bringing out the deep, fragrant wood, earthy, spicy and mildly tannic. The base beer has held up pretty well too with just a touch of oxidation (unfortunately mildly papery). Some buckwheat honey. The palate opens with caramel and cocoa before segueing into burnt toffee, buckwheat honey, earth and spice.

10099,33832,mcallister,4.3,"Well something mysterious about this beer in its appearance. As a brown ale it looks fantastic. A dark chocolate colored or even fudgy in appearance. A distinct creamy mocha head settles quickly into a light mist within seconds after pouring. Carbonation levels are obviously high as the snifter is swirled.  Chocolate in color and chocolate in aromas. Semiweet chocolate actually. Some dark fruits leaning toward plums and dates with a rum soaked raisiny edge. Than the wood sneaks in. Somewhat of a rustic scent with earthy undertones. And things mellow out in a thick brown sugar, and roasted malty aroma.  This is a good beer. A damn good beer in fact. Mouth coating with maybe the longest finish I've had in a brew. It just sticks with you and stays and stays and stays and...well you get the picture. Very rich and creamy. Tastes nearly like it smells with very litte in way of the wood used. Not sure how much of the wood could really infuse the beer anyway being a 10,000 gallon barrel. Gooey brown sugar with rummy raisins, roasted almost burnt malts, date, black fig, plums and nutty berry like middle. A damn good beer however this one is so big and rich it could take quite awhile to drink one let alone more. With age in the bottle I see that changing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93

I had a problem with the finish though. The after taste was a little bitter.  M- Loved the mouthfeel like how it coated your mouth and stayed with you till you let it go.

It pour with a huge frothy light tan head that has decent retention.  s: Mild chocolate notes with some faint wood and vanilla aromas. After warming a strong alcohol smell emerges.  t: Most noticeable are sweet peaty vanilla flavors, which are not at all cloying. It tastes of earthy dark fruits and a well balanced woody taste. Some bitterness in the form of coffee and chocolate. Absolutely unique and very complex.  m: Very thick and oily, a great body. The carbonation did not last as long I took to savor this.  d: I sampled the first batch at the Rehoboth Beach brewpub in the fall of '06. I remember tasting a lot of wood, vanilla, and booze.

Was planning on taking a trip to the brewpub to try this but didn't have to. This was served along with a desert which was a perfect pairing.  The beer poured a brownish black color with a thick tan head. The nose of the beer was a soothing toasted malty aroma. There was also a touch of coco in the nose. The beer had a full body and the taste gives you more of the strong malty backbone which is very pleasing. With the abv at about 14% this is a ver strong beer but Mike did a great job of melding the taste profile with the high abv. It does not at all overpower the last.

The GM was on scene and showed me a sample of the paolo santo wood that they age the beer with. Odd looking South American hardwood with a blue tint that gave the beer the peppery taste I mentioned.

Smells of maple syrup, molasses, prunes and an afterthought of coffee that obscured a hint of alcohol.  Tasted of a huge sugary bombardment of cane sugar, corn syrup and maple sap that surprisingly transitioned effortlessly into a dark (overly?) roasted malt.

""Thick"" aroma of hearty roasted malts. Extremely full flavored brew. Almost porter like roasted malts full of brown sugar, caramel and cocoa, maybe even some hints of vanilla. Apparently brewed with some rare, dense Paraguan wood. Didn't get much woodiness off the flavor, but that might've been because it is so big all by itself. According to Sam, it was actually a clear brew before the addition of the wood.  Finished with a sharp alcohol bite. Lost some drinkability due to the bite, but it was still very tasty.

10099,33832,Imstillthegman,3.78,"From DFH web site.... Palo Santo Marron  (Holy Tree Brown)  This beer is a 12% abv, highly roasty, and malty brown ale aged on the wood of the Palo Santo tree from Paraguay.  Palo Santo means ""holy tree"" and it's wood has been used in South American wine-making communities.  We were lucky enough to get our hands on 20 blocks of the super-dense wood and the wood was added to the ageing tank after fermentation.  It poured (in a snifter) a very dark, absolutely opaque brownish-black. About a fingers worth of tan head capped it off and left a small amount of very faint lacing.  The smell was light, even after it warmed. Mostly dark roasted malts, burnt toffee, and some lighter dark chocolate and coffee scents. Oh, and of course, wood.  The flavor was roasty, wet cardboard, but in a good way. The flavor of the wood came through good and it was tasty. But it still had a bit of wet carboard coming through...maybe it was the Palo Santo wood flavor.  Overall this is another different, unique creation from DFH. The abv snuck up on me and that made it a 3.5 instead of a 4.0. You don't smell or taste the alcohol, but you feel it. This was a good one, so hurry up and get some before it's gone.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,93
