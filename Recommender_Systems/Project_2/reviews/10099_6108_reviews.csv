10099,6108,Mightythor2000,3.59,"Pours beautifully, dark gold with a finger of head. Nice aroma, a little pungent with hops. The taste is very forward. Lots of hops, notes of pine and some more subtle citrus.  Overall a solid beer. I live a town over from both Bells and Founders so I’m a bit spoiled when it comes to IPAs and compare everything to a high bar. This one is good, but falls short of great. It lacks balance, a little too hoppy without any particular flavor standing out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,Christianriveraaa,4.31,"L: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass - golden color with a big head 2 fingers length risen. Some lacing left behind as the foam dissolves into liquid. S: Fruity aroma, orange apricot, malts, IPA aromas.4 T: Just as it follows with a bite. Orange, citrusy tastes with hops and some malts not as much as I smelled. F: Easy drinker, medium bodied, light carbonation. O: I actually like this IPA. I'm a stout guy but would definitely prefer this over Lagunitas. Definitely worth a try!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,whitro17,4.34,"Look - golden and a little cloudy, nice white head Smell - floral, pine, hop dankness Taste - citrus, pine, hop bitterness Feel - light body and carbonation. hoppy resin, crisp and dry finish. Overall - Been a while since I've had this one and I'm happy I got it. Really good hop bitterness but not in an overpowering way. Has that old school feel and taste. I love that it's 6% ABV so I'll be adding this into my rotation mix. I thoroughly enjoyed this fine IPA while jamming to Hall of the Mountain King by Savatage.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Not as complex or flavorful as Dogfish 90 minute IPA. Mouthfeel: Smooth and medium bodied with a low-to-moderate level of carbonation. Overall: Definitely a decent IPA, but there is a reason why this beer is not as highly regarded as its cousin, the 90 minute IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,eatsluggs,4.16,"Well, had it at a Buffalo wings spot. Definitely not what it should be served like. But, I can tell that properly handed, this would be an amazing beer. Notes of strawberries, and orange zest.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ReverendSoup,3.46,"I have had Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA before, which is just a phenomenal beer, and I have had Bell's Two Hearted Ale before, which is just 60 Minute IPA but better. There's some legends you simply cannot live up to. Your parents tell you you can be anything you want, but not everyone can be 90MIPA or Two Hearted Ale. That's life. Clear and orangeish with a three finger head. Beautiful IPA, Dogfish Head rarely disappoints when it comes to the aesthetics. Smells lemony. Pleasant! Tastes... Like hops. Not even great hops. Just hops. Limited flavors of anything else. It's not unpleasant but leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to my expectations of this particular brewery. Light and bubbly and happy in the mouth. It's a good beer, but there's just better equally available alternatives that makes it hard to imagine buying this again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,MadMadMike,3.99,"Pint pounder into a pint glass. Right to ‘Overall’: here’s a nice IPA to bring to a friend’s dinner party or BBQ. No one will be offended & many will be impressed at first try. Good beer.,.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,NCSapiens,3.88,"They took an extra 30 minutes to make a much better beer called 90 minute IPA. Or so the joke goes. 60 minute is ok, but honestly pretty mediocre.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,zman1974,4.7,"Could drink it all day. The feel is perfect. Reminds me of cream soda. The finish is where most IPA's and I part like the Red Sea, but I really like the clean, crisp finish. The opposite of Stone IPA in every way. Both are well-made, high quality beers but I much prefer Dogfish 60.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,MarshalLovesBeer,4.76,"This is a fairly nicely balanced sessionable IPA that leans a tiny bit more on the hop forward/herbal side of the house, but not nearly even close to something like Stone IPA’s level of super strong somewhat unbalanced hop character. This is more comparable to Lagunitas IPA balance wise, but I still prefer Lagunitas IPA over this. Not a bad IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Spaceguru,2.46,This is a watered down version of what it used to be several years ago. Dogfish Head’s beers are of a high quality but this is disappointing!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T: Tons of pine, a little citrus pith on the back, lingering bitterness. F: I think it's really smooth, with a little carbonation on the finish. O: Definitely a classic, though it's a little too forward to be a session IPA for me, and that's the niche I really want it to fill. Would grab it on tap if I saw it, though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ZebulonXZogg,4,"Crystal clear orange pour, soapy white head leaves a nicely laced glass. Snot locker get some grapefruit and a piney aroma. A good solid, old style IPA, been a long time since I've had one of these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Mugman8,4.02,"Cloudy orange tint on pour with fluffy head and lace curtains forming. Aroma is hoppy, piney and dank. Floral start, citrus middle with a finishing piney bite. A little too bitter for my tastes, but a finely constructed brew. Prefer the smoother finishing 90.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Perioddicals,4.34,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Dogfish Head IPA Glass. One finger white head. Light orange color. Hazy. Lots of lacing. Fades to thin head.  S - Floral and citrus. Bitter. Expected IPA scents.  T - Wow. The bitterness, floral, and citrus all blend down to a great mix. Holy moly this is smooth and easy to drink!  F - Just great. Light carbonation. Medium consistency  O - This is a world class IPA that sets the standard for me. The favor is so balanced. Other IPAs hit with too much of the bitter flavors that it's overpowering. This is is the IPA that I will compare future IPAs to. I definitely recommend it and will put it in my regular rotation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,kflorence,4.25,"Date on can: March, 2022  Pours a translucent, copper in color which turns gold when you hold it up to a light. A half inch of frothy foam sits on top that dissipates to a thin layer over time. Lots of lacing on the glass as you drink. Carbonation looks average. Smells chewy. Candied malts with a soapy, evergreen pine and citrus hoppiness. Taste is similar to the aroma. Lots of piney hops, a little bit of lemon/citrus and a lovely, sweet, bready maltiness in the background. Finishes bitter and a tad dry with lingering lemon and citrus rind on the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of creaminess and a touch of chewiness.  This is a superbly crafted brew, at one time probably one of the best IPAs in the U.S. It remains a very solid offering with a great amount of flavor and complexity, if a bit ""old school"" tasting. A great example of a hop-forward beer that isn't overly hopped. It is balanced quite nicely with a low-key malt profile that adds ample body and just enough counteraction to the bitterness. I'm surprised I never reviewed this, as I had originally tried this well over a decade ago. It's interesting to revisit it after all this time.

S: Pine resin, sweet hops. Quite simple. T: It's taste is stern with crisp pine, light citrus, sweet earthy grass, grains and pine lingers. There is light caramelized biscuit malt and the earthy hops are a bit spicy. It is hop forward. F: Brisk, semi-juicy med-bodied mouthfeel that is relatively smooth drinking and has a med-long finish.

10099,6108,hankp59,3.5,It’s an IPA. Slight haze descent head and nice small bubbles. More crisp than malty. Flavor of the hops add pine notes and a grapefruit citrus. Easy drinking and down the middle for the type.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,Jeez,3.65,"I wanted to dislike this so I could say something along the lines of ""60 Minute IPA? It took me as long to get through it"". But it's actually fine. Now I have to write a new joke before the end of this review.  It pours clear gold with a lingering white head. Not much hop character on the nose. Instead, it smells rather sweet and malty with a hint of orange. When I first tasted it, I wasn't enthused. Over time, I warmed up to it. The hops are mostly dank and citrusy, but not overpowering. Some malt, caramel and biscuit, is able to poke its head out. It finishes bitter. You will definitely be tasting it into your next drink. Man, is it smooth! Even if you aren't a hop-head, you have to admit it's very easy-drinking. Carbonation is pretty-  Oh, I've got one! 60 minutes could save you 6% or more on ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,HopHunterCL,4,Pours a clear golden color with a thick cap of white head. Caramel aroma with citrus peel and pine. Slightly sweet caramel malt with orange peel and grapefruit.

10099,6108,hmf05,4.45,"Perfect balance of hop flavor and bitterness with a strong malt backbone. Still holds up after all these years.

10099,6108,Ptrthrck,4.26,"Solid. Not quite as appealing aroma or appearance wise as Two Hearted Ale. Not offensive in any way. Very nice feel. It's a mellow beer with enough flavor to keep you sipping. 6% ABV so one after work is perfect to stretch the life of a sixer throughout the week. Seems like everybody knows and loves it, so if you offer one to someone they won't look at you like you have lobsters crawling out of your ears. Looking forward to finding 90 and 120 minute IPAs for upcoming events. Drink it!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,eameslover,3.75,This seems to be a maltier IPA with less of the floral sweet and citrusy hops. A good contrast to the many others this summer. Near the end it's almost bock like.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Some dank odors with a deep sniff. Good mouth feel and finish, but the part that hits the tongue is mildly bitter without much else. Update from later in the six pack (over a few days)- the gentle taste has grown on me. This is a really sublime and good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,UristMcBrewer,3.96,"The beer is a dark straw with a finger of white head. The head gives way to a lace. The beer is very clear and transparent. The nose has a base of sweet malt. The malt is like a heavy bread. Hop wise there, the smell is piney and citrusy. Specifically the citrus character comes out as grapefruit and is overshadowed by the pine. On tasting, the malt and pine notes are strong at first. The hops become earthy and then spicy as the malt fades. At the end of the palate the malt comes back and blends smoothly the spicy and earthy hops. The aftertaste is bitter as expected. The mouthfeel is loose with somewhat soft water. It washes over your mouth well. The carbonation i strong and pleasant.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Some jagged lines of lacing stick on glass. Aroma of bready malt base with citrus and floral hops. Not very aromatic. Taste is old school East Coast IPA, with low bitterness. Malt base, and floral, grassy, and citrus hops. Medium mouth feel. Some hop numbness on the tongue. Very good carbonation. Fizzes well in the mouth. Classic style and taste. Clearly hop driven but low in bitterness. Very drinkable. When I first drank this years ago, the excessive bitterness in IPAs was going on, and my impression was that this beer was lacking. With more experience I now recognize this as just a well made IPA, one to come back to again and again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,jkrich,3.96,"12 oz. bottle with a freshness date of May 2021: Poured a bright and clear golden hue with a sustained, foamy white-head. I was surprised to find this one so fresh and at only $6.99 a six-pack.  An explosion of refreshing, tropical fruit greeted the olfactory upon opening the bottle.  It has been quite a while since I imbibed a basic straight-forward IPA, i.e, one that is not hazy, fruity, and a double, triple or imperial IPA. As this is from a brewery that made its name with experimental beers, this is quite impressive. Very strong flavors of mango, and orange, and mild grapefruit keep this one refreshing, while the hop profile is never bitter. For 6 percent ABV, this is dangerously quaffable.  It is has been years since I drank this one; I'll have to remember this is quite an impressive interpretation of an American IPA, especially at that price.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Very good and much hoppier than the 90 min that I am used too. Not boozy at all, not very yeasty, but there is definitely a malty bready finish  F: Light, not effervescent, not pungent, not mouth coating, not oily yet not creamy, very smooth and very drinkable  Overall: wonderful hoppy flavor, affordable, fresh (10/21/2020) not much to dislike about this American IPA, it represents its style very well I give it a 95",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,datstankadank,3.63,"On draught. Good 3 finger head, caramel color. Smell is piney hops, sweet malt. Taste follows and is nicely balanced. Great lacing. Quite frankly, there is nothing worse than an overhopped beer with no supporting malt base. I think most followers of ipa's are very new to beer and just like to follow trends. This is one of the better ipa's ive had and its solely because of the balance of malt and hop. Would recommend.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

I notice a lot of grass clippings. Oak on the finish. Flavors are pronounced but could work better together. Stone fruit here and there.  F: Bitter throughout, liquid gelatin. Short lived effervescence that remains on the palate subtly for a time.  Overall, this IPA feels the best out of any I have tried. It doesn't flop and does what a direct IPA should.

The beer is an almost clear gold color with effervescence form center bottom of glass etch.  Nose is restrained with a wisp of grapefruit hops, fruit, and floral notes.  A soft bitter note hits the taste buds immediately followed by a slippery smooth honeyed malt. A light grapefruit bitterness rounds up the finish which comes off as slightly astringent.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, silky smooth, and slick. The carbonation stand out on the tongue and adds a sharpness to contrast the slight stickiness. The bitterness is mild and not too long lasting.  Another highly regarded IPA that is impressive and balanced. The bitterness rides on top of the slippery malt to ease drinkability.

Aroma: Slightly toasty malt base is prominent. Good mix of piney and citrusy hop aromas come through very well.  Taste: Mild sweetness from the malt base. Medium bitterness from the hops brings a good balance of flavor. Bitterness lingers.  Feel: Medium-light body with a medium carbonation. No astringency noted from either hops nor alcohol.

Light and smooth with a malt presence behind the hops to make it very drinkable.

10099,6108,Rug,4.1,"Bottled 3/20/20  Just realized I’ve never actually reviewed this American classic, as I usually just have it at bars  Pours a clear copper orange with 2 slowly settling fingers of soapy white head, just a bit of lacing  Aromas of zesty citrus, wheat, piney hops and caramel malts. Nothing too overbearing, great aroma  The lemony citrus and pine come through strong in the beginning of the sip, getting a bit more oily as the sip progresses, before finishing with lightly bitter hops  Medium bodied with very mild carbonation, this is rather still, but refreshing nonetheless with a mostly dry finish  It’s funny to me, seeing a beer I generally take for granted get rated so high by me. It’s always a solid option and widely available in bars and restaurants so I never really think twice about getting it, but keeping some of this at home would probably be a good idea for me. A classic for a reason",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Pine, citrus, hints of dank. Very subdued, however.  The brew has solid IPA flavors as well, with a bit more assertiveness. A touch of pale and caramel malt sweetness quickly steps aside for equal parts citrus and resin goodness A clean finish.  The brew feels down-the-middle medium in weight and finish.  I can't help but wonder if this one was getting a little ""long in the tooth"" (bottled in late December, and it's nearly mid-February, so getting close to 45 days). The hop flavors didn't pop like others have described. Then again, I've had the 75 and 90-minute varieties with consistently good results.

Rich golden gold body, very slight haze, rising bubbles, 2 finger white head of fine white foam falls and leaves good lacing.  Smells AMAZING! A burst of fresh juicy bubblegum inspired hop aroma is one of the finest yet. Pine notes, florals, etc. just so many good things going on in the nose!  Follows the nose to a point, in a way that works really well; abundant hop tones blend perfectly with citrus and pine over a firm base of malt body, while the feel is just as excellent! Living up to the score and rep!!!  Overall, YES! Highly recommended and just check the date first! ONE AWESOME IPA",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Hops greet the nose with citrus, pine and herbal notes. Toasted bread and biscuit in the background with some grain.  Semi-dry with bold hop bitterness, a funky grass flavor is added to the smell items. Pale and toasted malts keep the hops in check. Very light fruit taste of general citrus, mellon and dry grape builds up the middle. The finish is quick and almost crisp, a slight alcohol bite emerges. The aftertaste is all bitter hops lingering for a long while.  Medium-light body, above average carbonation. Soft and somewhat smooth from CO2 and generous malt.

It pours a slightly hazy, golden-orange with a half finger of fluffy, bright white cap and a thin film of lacing. It has a classic IPA nose of tart, bitter citrus and pine needles. But as the glass warms there is increasing sweet malt, onion, hop oil, and tangerine. The taste opens with bitter citrus: lemon peel and grapefruit rind, with some sweet citrus in the background. The hops are bitter but without a strong bite. The mouth feel is great! Lite and crisp with lively carbonation, and with an ABV of only 6% it's crushable.

Pours well with a 2-finger head and lace lasts. Deep straw/copper color - looks like an ale I can drink! Hoppy, citrusy, and a kind of earthy tone in the background - not sure which hops or yeast might be providing that flavor, but rather unique, sort of a hazy IPA flavor without the hazy. I’d definitely recommend pairing with some rich food to compliment the tone of the beer - fatty/salty pairing maybe.

10099,6108,Chaotic_Brown,4.73,"This might be a very jaded review but I judge all IPA's based on on 60 Minute.  The pour is refreshing as the smells and carbonation build to a light head which hangs around. The hops are immediately pleasant to the nose and not too over powering . The translucent amber hue make this IPA very eye appealing in the a glass. The first sip will give you a rush of carbonation and hops. Perfectly balanced crisp IPA flavor. A hint of pine will please both the nose and mouth. The flavor is also layered malts that only add to the joy of taking each sip. Definitely agree with those also who say there is a bread feel to the taste. Only slightly spicy notes hit at the end along with lingering hops that give a great after taste. The mouthfeel is smooth with medium carbonation and it is enough to give the flavors a little extra pop. This is a very drinkable IPA that is almost a a session beer at 6%. I have been told there are better IPAs, but each one I try does not match to the easy drinking 60 Minute. My only negative on this IPA is that I wish it had a bit more of a stronger hop smell as I believe it would add to the hoppy taste",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Squire,4,"Amber tinted clear gold color with good cap and lacing.  Aroma of bready malt and citrus hops with touches of pine and grapefruit.  Flavor for me is about 60'40 hop/malt ratio with both malt and hops retaining their identity. Malt is rich with the slightest touch of sweetness with hops shining brightly yet the hop flavors of pine, herbs, citrus and fruit all sing with one harmonious note. Also without bitterness which is a neat trick considering the amount of hops used. Very complex, very polished and easy to drink.  Medium full texture with balancing carbonation.

S - Grapefruit, pine, earthy hops, honey, bready malt, some spice  T - A bitter astringent alcohol bite up front, fruity citrus rind in the middle, some honey and orange blossom, but the best part is the strong biscuity malt finish to balance out the overpowering hop presence at first.  F - Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, fairly soft mouthfeel with a slightly dry finish.  O - A pretty balanced IPA despite the name. Although the astrigent hoppy bite up front really kicks it off, the bready sweetness at the end is worth holding out for.

Tried it years ago and never really appreciated it until I'd tried a hundred other IPAs. Now I get its popularity. Rich, deep gold (with a hint of amber) in the glass, with a healthy foam head that lasts and laces all along the way. Subtle hops in the nose and then on the tongue that varies between fruity and piney, then settles into a refreshing bitterness. A rich malty backbone--a hint of toast and biscuit--that rounds the flavor out nicely; followed by a soft bitter aftertaste that simply adds to the refreshing drinkability I mentioned before.

A mix of citrus/earthy hops and roasted malts that give the impressions of orange/grapefruit, pine, moss, herb, onion, and coffee on the palate. An odd collision of flavors.

A bit of pepper and spiciness overlying a caramel malt.Not much here. (3.50)  Flavor: Sharp bitterness upfront. Hop flavors of grass and roasted barley. Some pine and vague citrus. Its a light grass flavor with a roasted barley and coffee malt flavor. Not too earthy nor bitter. Bitterness is attenuated. A slight coffee malt. (3.75)  Feel: Medium bodied. Lower carbonation. Finishes mostly smooth. Minimal bitterness. (3.50)  Compared to Surly's Todd the Axe Man 12/20/20: Pours a similar color with a larger head. Milder aromas. More resinous green citrus, orange, kiwi. Darker malt. Less fruity and crystal malt.  Compared to Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA 4/19/21: Pours a lighter color. Milder aromas. More vague fruit. Not distinct. Similar caramel malt profile. Less piney, but similar sweetness. Slightly more spiced.  Overall: A resinous and darker, and spiced IPA. However, a mild bitterness. Has resinous orange citrus with a caramel spice malt. It seems sort of like Celebration, but with less bitterness and pine. Much more malty than I expected. I don't get a lot of pine here that I expected. Spiced, resinous, and malty.

Everything a hophead would want in their beer and more, having the simplicity of your average IPA yet all of the qualities and complexities seem to be fine-tuned just enough to stand out of the bunch.  Still containing the expected bitterness of an IPA with a nice prominent hoppy overtone, light citric and floral feel followed a malty finish. Alcohol is very well-hidden, practically non-existent.

I was a little disappointed in spite of the fact that I recently tried the Voodoo Ranger Imperial IPA from New Belgium, and I was really blown away by it so I had higher expectations for this one. I can see why a lot of people like it, but it's not my favorite. Smells of strong pine and hops, and I wanna say a touch of honey and honeydew zest with light citrus (primarily orange) notes. Smells great. Tastes very hoppy, with an orange taste on the back of my tongue. Long, lingering bitter hop aftertaste. Refreshing on a warm Texas day.

A bit lower in abv than typical WC IPAs and the light, clean taste reflects that. (90 Minute has a significantly bigger taste and feel) Decent glass lacing. Price for a 6pk on the west coast is in the 14-16 range, which is a bit high....but the shipping is a consideration here. Very drinkable, sessionable IPA.

Small bubbles give a creamy texture. Overall: A well-done IPA that's milder then a lot of others. Very drinkable and accessible. Everything is nice and balanced in this beer.

A bit malty sweet as well  Flavor starts slightly sweet with a citrus hop flavor, and hop flavor dominates throughout. Has a gradual transition towards a bitter finish - not a sharp break toward bitter. But the drying bitter finish comes through strongly in the end.  Medium body and carbonation.

10099,6108,steveh,4.01,"Always enjoyed this IPA on tap or for a hop fix, back in the day. Surprised I'd never reviewed it so, after Dry January and now craving some hops -- here goes.  Poured into my Libbey Imperial Pint. Bottled-on date of 12/11/18 -- so not terribly old.  L -- Clear, deep gold with a white head that pours very dense and holds up well, leaving nice lacing as it slowly settles.  S -- Pine resins up front. Vague biscuit malts fighting to be recognized.  T -- Same pine resins up front in the flavor, if not as harsh as in the nose. Lightly sweet biscuit malts balancing out the hops nicely. Bitter resins rounding out the finish and aftertaste. Light citrus notes at the very finish of the drink.  F -- Mouthfeel is soft to crisp with a light-medium body.  O -- While I wish there was more malt character in the nose, and maybe more citrus esters in the flavor, that's just my preferences in an IPA. There's no mistaking what's in your glass with this beer, and it's very well made.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,Precisiondigital,3.61,"It's not the best IPA. It is very hoppy. Maybe I just don't like the hoppy being that bitter. But even other IPAs that are more bitter don't leave this stale aftertaste. It's not all horrible... But maybe the name hints at the fact that it is made quickly and with low grade . It says it has over 60 hop additions over a 60 minute boil... maybe that's why it is so hoppy. But Im just not a big fan. I think it could be better. Maybe the beer im drinking right now has just been sitting on the shelf too long. who knows. I'd buy again if i had a choice between miller or keystone, but it isn't the best IPA I've ever had.

10099,6108,Bsimpson91,5,"Truly a wonderful IPA that is well done through and through. To be honest, I dont like the presentation of the label. Its a little cheap looking and for a long time I never bought this beer because of that. Luckily, the reputation it has in the beer community far exceeds its looks. First let's talk about the aroma. Nice bright citrus and pine aroma with a tail end of malt. The smell reminds me of grapefruit and maybe some pineapple or mango. The taste complements the aroma. Upfront you get a bright fruity start. A tad bit of sweetness but mostly a mango, pineapple and grapefruit tartness that lends perfect to the style. The middle of the sip has all the Malt backbone and bold richness and exits your pallet with a buildup of pine and citrus hop notes. Damn near perfect for a IPA. The feel is crisp, clean and refreshing. This IPA is smooth with a medium body and semi dry finish. I think this a well done beer and whold highly recommend you try it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Aroma: Wonderful assorted hop aromas, a bit of sweet but light malts, and some resiny spice notes. There are also grassy aromas and a light dankness. Taste: Big crisp and clean hops flood the palate, though the bitterness remains relatively low. The malts are more apparent on the taste than they were on the nose, but they never get in the way and thankfully allow the hops to shine. Speaking of the hops, they are a very pleasant mixture of pine, lemon, and a small amount of pineapple. The malt profile is more along the lines of saltine cracker to very light toast. The finish leans more toward dry and is very clean, leaving only a brief residual bitterness. Biased comments: Light, but full of flavor, 60 Minute is a beer applicable to almost any occasion.

I do taste a difference with canned although all are acceptable examples. 60 minute is a great microbrewery beer that is middle of the road affordable, with adequate alcohol, bitterness, floral and fruity to appeal to everyone except people who hate ipas all together. I love 60 minute as it’s very well balanced and not a hit you in the face ipa like most Troeg ipas and others. I would say it’s slightly better than a laguinitas ipa (before the Heineken takeover) as it has better balance and hops. Laguinitas being more floral. As I am a person with a penchant for more alcohol, feel free to chase down 90 minute and 120 minute...just remember that both the taste and bitterness are widely different and 60 minute will have much broader party appeal.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Gets a bit sweeter before finishing with a nice hoppy bite at the back of the mouth right at the top of the slide down the throat. Up front is a bit of tingling sweetness.  Mouth feel leans toward medium but has a fairly dry finish. Almost like the hops snap it off at the back end of the mouth. Does leave a bit of stickiness in the back of the throat.  A very nicely balanced IPA that showcases all aspects of the beer, malts and hops working together in near perfect harmony.

Bonus points for a nice rocky head that lingers. Smell is very subtle. Taste is old school IPA - bitter and dank with hints of citrus, pine, and grass. Malt focuses on the low lovibond flavors of cracker and very light biscuit. I like that as it lets the hops really cone through.

There was a beautiful balance there.Back then this original dogfish head 60 minute IPA would have gotten at least a B score from me. Now that I am revisiting this in 2017 and the first thing I notice is different label art. That is okay you know no big deal, but it does not taste like how a dogfish head 60 minute IPA should taste like. They have changed up the hop profile and the taste has gone downhill. It's both overly grapefruity and too earthy tasting. Where is the malts to match this hop profile. Stop trying to compete with other breweries because your just ruining your flagship beers. This is not okay tasting and if you think it is then you probably enjoy drinking a 6 pack of watered down filled corn syrup like keystone ice as well. Cheers!

Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA is much better at this price point. Honestly this is the kind of effort I would expect from Anheuser Busch.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

I said I'd have that. Turned out to be 60 Minute. Typical restaurant pour: standard pint glass, minimal head. Slightly hazy amber color, with a white head (what there was of it). Absolutely wonderful aromas and flavors of pine and citrus, with notes of tropical fruit and light caramel. Very well balanced, with a solid malt backbone to support the hop bitterness.

10099,6108,TheCondor,4.13,"Picked this beer up in Cincinnati on a recent trip. Have I mentioned I really like the Queen City? I think it is a nice place. BUt I digress.  Appearance - Pours a nice, slightly cloudy golden color with a slim finger of soapy white head that dissipates rapidly but leaves some lacing.  Smell - Citrus, grass, picked up a lot of malts though. Could be well-balanced. Very excited about it  Taste - Much more malty than I originally expected! I really enjoy it, very well-balanced. Malty up front, hoppy in the middle. A nice hoppy bitter to it.  Mouthfeel - A crisp, bitter finish. Clean as a whistle. Really enjoy it!  Overall - This is an excellent beer, I would highly recommend it.

Relatively light bitterness in excellent balance with overall flavor profile. M: Light to medium bodied with moderate to strong carbonation. Crisp and clean finish. O: This is a go to EC IPA.

Citric aroma with a bitter edge and caramel malt underneath. There’s some papaya and melon.  Sweet juicy malt with good buzzy citrus hopping. Oranges, lemons, and grapefruits are all represented. The finish is lightly bitter and gives us a nice biscuit note to chew on.  Initially the feel is like crisp like plate glass underfoot. As it warms things become slightly soapy, but can still be called clean.  60 Minute is a good example of the East Coast style before it developed. I appreciate that it’s not too sweet and the biscuit note helps set it apart.

S- Piney and grassy (EARTHY) hops followed by a peppery/rosemary-like aroma. Phenolic in a sense with a touch of lemon and caramel. T- The right amount of bitterness that is followed by an almost spicy peppery note? Sweet caramel follows, as well as a malty sweet body. Lemon zest is present. Very nice, and unexpectedly mellow. F- Thin and crisp O- There is no question that there are too many ipa styles to know which is the best. But this ""East Coast"" ipa as it is labeled seems to have a very unorthodox mellowness to it's flavor palette; which brings me to say that it is very intriguing. Is this the best beer I've had from the style? Not by a long shot. But it is extremely pleasant and as always a well crafted beer by DogfishHead. The flavor can be too mellow though, and can certainly come off as watery because of that. It also seems like it is lacking depth, which in turn leads me to say that this is a very GOOD ipa.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Grapefruit peel and orange peel are the most prominent citrus tastes, following with very earthy flavors like pine and grass in contrast, which all encompasses its dank hoppy foundation. Feels smooth and somewhat thick, certainly not thin and watery.  This beer isn't bitter and has great hops, but compared to the 90 Minute IPA it isn't as creamy, smooth, or sweet.

A slightly citrus after taste. No alcohol, no diacetyl. Palate – light to medium, watery, lively carbonation.  An average IPA, closer to the APA end of the scale.

Taste is very bright and crisp, more bready malts with a mild bitter bite and piney and slightly fruity hops that come through stronger than in the aroma. Aftertaste is bitter and bready. Light-bodied. I really enjoyed this beer.

T - Good, straightforward hop flavor that is clean and refreshing. Does not taste like a 60 IBU at all. A good balance of hop and malt flavor. F - Medium body, high carbonation. Very easy to drink. O - This was the beer that got me into IPAs in the first place. It is an excellent choice for someone just getting into hoppy beers but not quite yet a hophead.

10099,6108,CrashingConcord,3.8,"Preamble: Dogfish is a damn good brewery, and I am by and large an enormous fan. 60 Minute - at least as of late - however, has fallen flat.  Don't get me wrong, everything about this beer's backstory, composition, brew process, and even label description leads one to believe that it should be some straight divine nectar, and considering the undeniable hop presence, this should be the beer I dream about. But... Disclaimer over.  The hoppiness at first taste is pleasant, yes, and I love the bitter grassiness, but it gives way to nothing else. If the selling point of your hop behemoth IPA is the lupulin monstrosity therein, I'm hoping for a little more complexity than just grass.  Again, I sandwich the criticism with an absolute adoration for Dogfish, an understanding that perhaps I may not yet have the palate to appreciate the nuances, and a recognition that I have appreciated this beer more so in the past.  There is also a pretty solid malt backbone intermingling with the hoppy lead.  Have I been apologetic enough?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,doktorhops,4.13,"This one has been near the top of my hit list for a while: Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA… or was it the 75 Minute IPA? Or the 90 Minute IPA? Or their 120 Minute IPA? Case in point: Dogfish Head make a lot of IPAs and it’s hard to keep track of them, but I’ll give them all a go when I get the chance. As an East Coast style IPA I’m expecting it to be smooth bodied with a juicy hop aspect and a decent balance between bitter/sweet (perhaps erring on the side of sweet). Fun fact: Dogfish sharks have venom which coats their dorsal spines which is mildly toxic to humans - true story.  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a nonic pint.  A: Cloudy marigold body with a nice dense one centimetre cream-coloured head. This looks absolutely fantastic for an IPA - just the right shade of amber, cloudy and with top-notch head retention, nice! 8/10.  S: Once again hop-fade is the bane of my existence - although this was bottle in 09/16 (4 months ago)… I guess that’s long enough to expect hop-fade. Aroma is more malt than hop driven, damn shame, notes of: Caramel, fresh baked biscuits, hint of citrus, and a light floral touch. Still not bad but definitely lacking hop aroma in the 4 months since it was brewed. 7/10.  T: Still firmly citrus driven in the flavour though, begins with lemon, then grapefruit through to fresh-squeezed orange in the finish, which is of a medium (and quite appropriate) bitterness. Caramel/biscuit malts throughout the palate lay a solid sweet foundation for this (after 4 months still) hop driven delight. 9/10.  M: Medium bodied with a nice dense but light carbonation, pretty spot on mouthfeel. 9/10.  D: The closest IPA I would compare this to is Smuttynose Finestkind IPA, however Smuttynose edges this overall. It must be noted that Smuttynose was about the same age when I tried it so really between the two IPAs it’s really about the one that aged best, I would love to have gotten my hands on both when they were fresh however East Coast US beers don’t seem to get shipped as easily and frequently as West Coast brews, hence the possible discrepancy between my scores - really with IPAs I am fast learning (from homebrew as well as drinking): The fresher the better, and: Old IPAs - don’t bother. 8/10.

10099,6108,Jacob_Hargis,4.67,"Poured 12oz bottle into one of my favorite vintage German beer glasses- a Holsten Pilsener goblet I inherited from my German great grandfather. I live in California, so I usually stick to west coast beers. This is surprisingly the first Dog Fish Head beer I've sampled, despite knowing quite a bit about the brewery and the uniqueness of the styles of beers Sam Calamine and his brew wizards do at DFH.  Pours a nice golden color with evenly spread foam around the upper rim of the glass with carbonation bubbles zipping up spontaneously from the bottom of the glass. Lacing present.  On the nose- ah yes, citrus--but not overwhelming and splashes of herb pale malts coming through.  Tastes of citrus (lemon, grapefruit, zest, with pine (not resiny) and malt sweet. VERY well balanced. Usually you think, big IPA (relatively low A.B.V) would expect a big punch in the mouth...but not at all. The even distribution of hop flavors in my mouth leave me quite giddy and my pallet fresh. The mouth feel is light, carbonated, almost creamy with a bit of crispness on the end, not leaving your mouth sticky.  Overall- Truly a quintessential session IPA. I'd bid this beer over many other styles. I think this beer is a great bridge for those looking to get into drinking more IPA's, or those that are looking for a well balanced (not overly hopped) brew with a well balanced flavor, great mouthfeel, and lower alcohol content--to leave you drinking more and not feeling ""hopped out"".

Lots of evergreen and citrus. Fresh herbs and spice.  T/F: A perfectly balanced IPA. Grainy malts and ample hops. Just what you'd expect from the style. Grapefruit and tropical fruits mix with resinous pine and floral notes. Mild peppercorn. Medium body and well carbonated.  O: One of the true standard bearers for the style.

The finish is pretty clean, with very little lingering hop bitterness. The body is medium, but maybe very slightly lighter than the average IPA. This is a very light, refreshing IPA, which has become too rare in my opinion these days without going into session IPA territory. Likewise, the balance is also fantastic, another IPA rarity as of late. This is an eminently drinkable IPA that is accessible even to those that aren’t major fans of the style.

Feel is crisp with some creaminess and stickiness. I could use a little more of a lighter feel and more carbonation, but the present characteristics keep it from feeling watery.

The smell of 60 Minute IPA, is rich with hops, grains and malts. There is also some grassy notes in the smell of this IPA. This IPA has the look and smell of most IPA's on the market. Now for the taste, it is bold with hop flavors. Then you pick up on the grains and malts. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a nice balance to it. There is a fair amount of lacing to 60 Minute IPA , it sticks to the glass well. 60 Minute IPA has a lot going on in it, however it is like most IPA's on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing.

Smell: Smells of a variety of hops from east to west coast and maybe some spicy European hops. All of the hops is making it so that only a faint crystal caramel malt can come through. Taste: Hops, Hops, Malts, Malts and more hops. Very well balanced. Got the citrusyness from the hops, the spiciness, the herbalness, and the very pleasant sweetness of the malts that goes away without a trace at the end. Feel: Decent carbonation. Seems a bit lighter in carbonation than your typical IPA's. Not too thin, very very good in the mouth Overall: This beer is a great IPA. It is a great representation of what I think an IPA should be. It is very well balanced and very refreshing. It is not a death by hop bomb, and the hops isn't exclusively tropical citrus, pineapple and mango. It's got some citrus, some pine, some floral notes, and a little bit of an herbal spiciness. And the alcohol content isn't through the roof.

First to the nose is a pungent, herbal hop quality and some light citrus. A grainy malt aroma comes to suggest popcorn and crackers. Dried herbs and slight spices punctuate the aroma, and these notes increase as the beer warms.  Strong crackery malt mixes with herbal and spicy hops for a very mellow, rounded tasting IPA. There is no hop smash, or intense aromatics. Taste is deep, rustic, and smooth. Popcorn-like quality of the malt, as well as a slight orange citrus quality from the hops are increasing, all riding on that mellow backbone of dried herbs. Graham-cracker like flavors become more apparent. So too does a slight buttery-ness. Bitterness is medium and mostly rides on the finish, which leans to the herbs and produces a slight metallic twinge to the aftertaste.  Medium body with a slight creaminess. Finish is ""gulpy""- that is, not too carbonated or attenuated. Mixes interestingly with the herbal, somewhat metallic aftertaste.  A much less intense IPA than I remembered, even compared to the other ""old standards.""

The bottle lists the ABV (6.0%) and there is a bottled on date (05/17/2016).  S: [3.50] Crackers, then slight caramel and grassy scents. Overall the aroma is pretty subdued.  T: [3.75] Toffee, caramel up front then it rolls into some piney hop flavor. Maybe some hints of lemon rind late.  M: [4.25] This beer is smooth. There is no jarring hop whollop late. It has a nice heft to it and a nice level of carbonation.  O: [3.75] For an IPA this is pretty low key on the hops and bitter. I get very little hop aroma at all. The hops are more noticeable in the flavor - but even there it is mellow. This is really easy drinking with a really excellent smooth mouthfeel. Even at 6.0% you could put away a few of these pretty quickly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Overall clean aroma, nothing seemed out of proportion.  Taste: Citric hops up front: grapefruit, lemon zest, and a splash of orange. Sweet, light notes of caramel sat between the hops and malts.

One can find hopper, fruitier, ""copperer""and other comparative ""er's"" out there but with comparitives, there must be the item to which they are compared. Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA is it. The aroma is hoppy without pine tree nutso stuff, the head is thick and frothy even from the bottle, the appearance is ""delightfully clear,""the color is yellow to copper without haze, and the flavor is classic, nervously balanced bitterness.

Beer is amber with bubbles streaming towards the surface, forming a tall white head that slowly subsides and leaves behind solid lacing.  Smell is straight-up hops, very citrusy. Taste follows nose. There is a lingering citrusy bitterness,like how an orange rind tastes. Carbonation is fairly average.

While I'm not a fan of how NE IPA's typically Look, their Smells often make up for Looks. So is the case with 60 Minutes, a trendsetter. The fruity hops really dominate the nose with almost a belated recognition that there is a semi-sweet malt in there. For Tastes, the malt develops more and provides balance until about the fourth sip when the hops (60 IBU) remind me this beer is above my bitterness threshold. Too bitter a finish to eat with food.

Appearance: pours a slightly hazy gold, with one finger bright white head and initially very active carbonation that fades to a few large slow bubbles. Not much in the way of retention, just a few bubbles at the edge and a thin skim across the top. Moderate lacing.  Smell: hoppy and sweet. Mostly a sweet mandarin orange, with a little pineapple. Pretty traditional and very inviting.  Taste: dry and piney arrival. Broadens to show off a little citrus and resin before turning to a light, bone dry soda cracker, with a moderate bitterness that lingers, but only mildly. Very cleansing.  Mouthfeel: on the lighter side of midweight. Well carbonated, but not excessive. Clean and crisp as can be.  Overall: this is a very refreshing, balanced but extremely dry, crisp, and piney IPA. I could see myself really jonesing for this on occasion, but it's not one I would make a regular. Very much in the vein of Finestkind and Stone IPA.

I recall an article in The New Yorker from several years ago wherein Sam Calgione, the DFH founder/brewmaster/guru and Garrett Oliver, brewmaster of Brooklyn Brewery, were interviewed, separately, about their respective businesses and offerings, and Mr. Calgione just came across as an elitist and egomaniac. And some of that hubris shows up in his beers, many of which are just downright weird and silly. No beer on earth should have some of the stuff he throws into the tun. I'm all for experimentation, but there are limits. ... Okay, rant over, onto their best and most simple beer, the 60 Minute IPA. It is one of those rare IPA's that, to my palate, pleases on many levels but still speaks directly to the hophead craving we all get from time to time. It is also equally pleasing in the bottle and on draught. I'm not sure if this is considered their ""flagship"", but if not, it should be. Restraint and balance were both in command with this one, can't say the same for either the 90- or 120-minute versions, which are, in my view, all out assaults on your salivary glands. 60-minute stands up very nicely to any of the other top-shelf IPA's out there, and it's very wide availability makes it an easy find in my neck of the woods.

10099,6108,HotDogBikeRide,4.02,"Poured from a bottle, bottled on my birthday, 11/17/15. Look is a translucent, see through golden copper, with a bubbly copper head. Smells kind of like a good smelling cleaner, with a very distant malty resinous undertone. Low alcohol content for the style, at least of the dozen or two I've tried now - I'm used to a bit more, and am not getting buzzed enough on my sixer, haha.  I got a lot of a ""kolsch"" vibe from this IPA, some of the tones on both the nose and the taste remind me a tad of some kolsches I've tried -- that cleaner-type vibe (faint ammonia?) and certain taste it leaves on the mouth and specifically throat. I don't mean that in a big mean negative way, just hard to point the finger on, I've drank many a six pack of kolsches (Saint Arnold Lawnmower, etc) happily. I am just judging it based on it being an IPA.  That being said, there is something to this beer that sets it apart from others. It has a pretty huge amount of flavor from the moment it hits your pallet, sending like 5 or 10 different malty/lite hoppy flavors your way before it settles on the tone described above. Could use some more hoppiness/IBU or maybe just alcohol haha. I can definitely see the uniqueness and why DFH has built a name for themselves, they are kind of giving me a St. Arnold vibe, a commercial level craft brewer worthy of their large size and influence. (I'm from Texas.) I might have to try a few more to find my favorite though. Maybe the 90 next time? Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The smell of this beer is pretty nice, not super potent, but still really good. It's got citrus, maltiness, a little honey, and some juicy smell to it. The taste is great. So balanced in my opinion. Perfectly bitter, piney, juicy and the perfect amount of malt to balance the hops. Mouthfeel is medium and dry finished. Overall, 60 min IPA is great. I will definitely drink this one again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,ThomasMetal75,3.8,"A- Deep, golden color. Head was 2 fingers, but died to a fingers worth. Head was bright-white in color. Some carbonation could be seen streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Looks like a classic American IPA for sure.  S- Sweet, biscuty malts. I'm getting citrus hop notes of grapefruit, pineapple, and orange. It's a juicy type smell. There also is a light scent of a dank, oily, hoppiness as well. Very nice and inviting.  T- I get sweet malts and citrusy hop notes right upfront. Again like in the nose, I am getting grapefruit, pineapple, and orange flavors. There's a spicy hope quality as well. I am also picking up a pale, caramel type malty flavor too. Grassy and earthy notes are detected. The finish is fairly on the dry side.  M- The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium. It's not too heavy as far as an IPA is concerned. The beer is very crisp tasting. It is extremely refreshing. There is a bit of a hoppy oily, slickness to the brew. But I think the mouthfeel is good for as far as an IPA is concerned.  Overall this beer is awesome. Even though my overall rating averages to a 3.75/5, I'd give this brew an A average. If you like IPAs and want something very drinkable with a little more abv than a session IPA, this is the beer for you! So much flavor and so easy to drink. There is no wonder why this is such a loved IPA within the craft beer community!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

A bit of citrus, some caramel sweetness and graham cracker.  F: Medium light body with medium carbonation. Slick mouth feel.  O: This is a well executed IPA. The bitterness and flavor hops are nicely balanced as is the malt under tones. A beautifully balanced, hop forward ale. Lemon citrus notes fill in a complex flavor profile.

Perfect match!  Look: Beautiful golden color and clear. Small off-white head that persists only at the edges. Great lacing as you drink it.  Smell: Classic IPA hop scents: piney, floral, citrusy. A bit of honey. I love the smell.  Taste: Subtle and not very bitter for an IPA. Nicely balanced, you can actually taste the malt, which I like. Doesn't taste quite as good as it smells, but still very good. The bitterness lingers in the aftertaste and invites you to drink more.  Feel: Medium carbonation, a little thin/watery.

10099,6108,breadwinner,3.64,"I dunno. I kinda liked the nose -- it makes you realize what a landmark beer this was, because so many other (subsequent) IPAs smell like it. Vaguely citrusy, sort of freshly herbal -- it just smells like hops + a clean and present maltiness. The bitterness doesn't seem very apparent at first, but it kind of wears on you as you go. And that clean maltiness grows in stature, offering some alcoholic sweetness. Combine that with the bitterness, and it gets a little tough to keep slugging down. I dig what it's done for the growth of the IPA and American craft. But, frankly, it's not something I'd often reach for.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BryanReed,3.51,"Pours pale copper. Small 1/2 inch head, goes away pretty quick.  Smell is largely underwhelming. Slight malt sweetness and some fruity hops. Much more restrained than I thought it'd be.  Taste is about what the aroma suggested. Malty sweetness, some citrus and juicy hops, low bitterness, and a slight pine way off in the back. Also pretty subdued.  Mouthfeel is light and almost watery for the style. Although refreshing, and very sessionable, I want a bit more body in my ipas.  Overall, I was hoping for more after trying 90 min. Pretty subtle flavors. Would make a great fridge stocker, could pound them anytime, but not something I'd lust after.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

I think that the 90 min might be better because I did catch myself wanting a little more booze with all the flavor in this beer. It's not busting with flavor but it does have your typical ipa bitterness along with a mild but noticeable citrus which I am not crazy about. I just think it wasn't necessary to put it in there at least not as noticeable as it is. Anyway if you haven't tried this beer then give it a shot but you might be better off with 90 min if you like your flavors with some kick if you know what I mean.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T -- First hit is pine and resin, some floral and grassy notes follow up, then dank comes in mid palate, and bitter takes it out through the end. With warmth, the citrus shows up stronger, mostly in the mid/end notes. The dankness also mellows out a bit, turns into herbal and earthy notes. There's also a sweetness to it that keeps it from being a hopbomb.  F -- Crisp, good bitterness, a little resin leftover.  O -- Good overall beer.

The taste started off bitter and once again as it warmed, a nice sweet connotation from the maltiness blended in. A long sweet citrus to caramel aftertaste roamed into the finish.

That is all I’ll say for now. Check back for updates to the taste.  Mouthfeel-It is medium-bodied and delicious with a slight bite and well-balanced carbonation.

10099,6108,A_Pint_A_Day,4.65,"Appearance – Dark gold to copper in color with no haze. Very carbonated but only yielding one finger worth of spongy foam when poured. A good amount of lacing left on the side of the glass as the foam receded.  Smell – Very malt forward at first smell. Grassy and citrusy notes from the hops are definitely present.  Taste – Very in balance for an IPA. Super malty and kind of sweet with biscuit like flavors floating around. Hops add some grassy and citrus characteristics to the beer, with the citrus flavors being closer to orange in flavor than the expected grapefruit from American IPAs. The finish was not as bitter as expected but was strong enough to balance out the intense maltiness.  Mouthfeel – Medium in body and quite carbonated.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

S: A nice balance between grassy & citrus notes. I actually get a kind of marmalade thing as well. Some biscuity maltiness underneath.  T: Follows the nose somewhat. Sandwiched between pleasant hop-bitterness is a nice, woody malt note. I also get lemon rind & fresh herbs.  M: Excellent carb to go along with a slightly slick, full bodied malt character.

Very slight skunkiness, but I am not bothered by it. Many people find IPAs refreshing, but I've always considered them more ""bracing"".. more of a cold weather beer.

10099,6108,Jeffrey-Pulver,4.44,"Not your average IPA. Most IPA's I've had thus far have been very bitter and full of flavor, which is why I love them. This IPA however is full of flavor but lacking in the bitterness, which makes it special. All those flavors that can sometimes be overpowered by the bitterness of most IPA's. This one doesn't and it's like that for a reason. This IPA is FULL of flavor that is a nice change of pace. It's almost perfectly golden clear, light on smell of sweetness, and the mouthfeel was the only thing I found somewhat disappointing. It seemed to be over carbonated, sometimes turning into full foam and bubbles in my mouth. But this is a small complaint.

Taste: tastes of hops/ orange peel/ "" piney"" taste noted as well. Feel is not bad, not too carbonated but it does feel a tad bit heavier that other IPA,s that I've had. Overall, I would recommend this beer to someone new to craft beers",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,MaximalC,3.96,"Pours a translucent, golden amber color with an inch of coarse, white froth that hangs around for a while. Nuanced aroma smells of grapefruit, floral hops, candy sugar, and an almost Belgian yeast/clove element.  The first thing that strikes me with the taste is that this is a nicely balanced IPA. There’s a complex malt profile that includes toasted bread, honey, caramel, white grapes, and pears. The hops are floral and slightly spicy, while the yeast adds a chalky aspect that lends additional character and complexity. There is some pine resin in the finish, but this no conifer-bomb, to be sure. There’s also an underlying fruitiness that makes for a very light and engaging drinking experience. Medium body and carbonation complement the taste nicely, although the body wavers just a bit on the back end.  Overall, this is a delightfully balanced and nuanced IPA. I’m not sure if this bottle had some age on it to mute the hops a bit, but this was much more to my liking than your typical IPA. I wouldn’t even mind sessioning this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TopherBreski,3.41,24 oz from BWW. A pale yellow with a thick head that sticks around. Very strong hoppy and citrus smell that is too overpowering IMO. Taste is synonymous with the smell.

10099,6108,Caj1,4.24,"I finally decided to give this a shot, since I have run out of excuses not to. I am not a huge fan of the Dogfish Head offerings I have received, mostly due to their prohibitive price and sometimes funky flavors. However, this is a classic in craft brewing so I needed to try it. I go in with no bias against this particular brew.  12 oz. glass bottle, poured into trusty pint glass. Creamy head foams up immediately with a moderately heavy pour, two fingers' worth settles in and it sticks around a good while with moderate lacing and carbonation. Color is a nice solid gold and clarity is perfect. I would like to see this more on the amber side since that signals a good mix of beery barley and malt with the hops.  Smell is as expected: citrus, grass, and some malty notes, but the hops are not overwhelming.  Flavor is good but could stand a notch more malt and deeper, richer roasted notes. That said, the hops are surprisingly subtle, though plenty flavorful. The bitterness is tempered by the fruity notes, and there is a little bit of that oily texture IPAs can bring. The hops are blended well with the ale flavors, though, and there is a nice touch of sweetness, a hint of butterscotch and some good nutty flavors on the palate.  Mouthfeel is extremely crisp and clean with a nice carbonation and hops bite. Goes down smooth and easy, and wouldn't be out of place in the warmth of summer.  To summarize, this beer is quite good and I can definitely see how it was once considered groundbreaking. I also respect that they allow subtlety in their work, since they don't fall victim to the ""ADD MORE HOPS"" trap like a lot of other guys. My main complaint is that it needs deeper body and that it could stand to go down a couple bucks in price. But it is a darn fine beer nonetheless.  To good health and good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,DabblinWiscCraft,3.96,"My local gas station actually has sixers of 60 Minute--they must have just started receiving them recently--and the price is about $2 cheaper than anywhere else in town! At any rate, I poured this right from the fridge into my Lakefront pint glass. Bottled on date reads it's about two months old.  L: Pours a honey amber color with about an inch-and-a-half of off-white head that sticks around for a good while and leaves nice lacing on the glass. This beer is just ever-so-slightly cloudy and has decent visible carbonation.  S: Bready malt and earthy hop notes in the nose, with just a bit of citrus coming through. Not a very assertive bouquet from this pour, but what's there is nice.  T: Bready malts and a lot of what's best described as earthiness in the front--the hops are registering somewhere close to resinous/piney but not quite there. As the flavors transition to the back, the hops become much more pronounced as pine, and some clear alcohol emerges. The malts remain on the scene, as you get more of sense of rye at the back. There's a suggestion of grapefruit rind as the bitterness takes over at the end. Tasty, though I was hoping for a bit brighter hop profile.  F: The feel is pretty spot-on: it's medium-bodied, well-carbonated, a bit creamy at the front, and perfectly bitter at the back, hitting the palate but not overly sticky.  O: This is a nice IPA--one of the better ones that can be found anywhere (around here) at any time of year. I wouldn't place this one above Two Hearted--kind of my standard--but it definitely drinks easy and delivers the qualities you want in a single IPA. My only complaint is that the bouquet and taste don't deliver big/bright enough hop notes.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

S - Sweet bready malt with some citrus notes and hops behind T - sweet bready malt up front that follows with a nice amount of citrus and hops. Caramel and biscuit notes intermixed that provide a nice well rounded taste. F - medium body with a medium amount of carbonation. O - A really solid, dependable IPA. It's not too harsh, but still has the little bit of extra something that sets this apart from other IPAS.

Pours a dark gold with a 1 finger white head of foam. Smells of hops, pine, grass, orange, citrus, and a slight hint of malt. Taste is of hops, pine, and citrus mainly. Some hints of orange peel. No malt. Slight malt presence in aftertaste along with traces of hops and pine.  Overall a good IPA, but it didn't impress me like I had hoped. Smell, and more importantly, taste are both a bit lacking in my opinion. Very drinkable. I feel like I could sit and enjoy several of these, unlike some other IPA's. I just feel like it's missing something. Maybe the 90 minute IPA will be more up my alley.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,tekstr1der,4.02,"Pours gold-brown with thin, clingy off-white head. Aroma is citrus and malt, not as pungent as I’d expected. Same with the flavor - this is definitely session beer.

10099,6108,Beric,4.1,"Serving: Bottle into snifter Served: 15 Feb 2015  Appearance: Pours more golden than many IPAs, with a soft white head. Leaves some lacing.  Smell: Big hops up front, with a notably floral aspect. Some soft citrus notes- mandarin orange and grapefruit- in there too. A touch of dankness.  Taste: Nice smooth hoppiness all the way throughout the sip, starting with a punch of floral hops and followed by a nice citrusy, bitter finish. Good malt body carries the hops and provides just a touch of sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, would have liked just a touch more.  Overall: Another great IPA from DFH and one that is lower in alcohol than many of its brethren without sacrificing body or flavor. Delicious beer, though I admittedly like 90 Minute more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,EvoRich,4.01,"Look: Pours with a nice fluffy head, a golden yellow. Only a little hazy. Mostly clear.  Smell: Very piney hops, with a touch of lemon.  Taste: Hops are not as aggressive in flavor as the are in the aroma. The flavor is much more tame than the smell suggests. A little less piney and more lemon.  Feel: Medium bodied with good carbonation.  Overall: My least favorite of all DFH IPA's. Still overall decent.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Its good, nothing exceptional. i can think of four or five ipa's off the top of my head from Chicago breweries that id choose over this any and everyday. If its the only beer available like twas the case today i would gladly drink it. If you havent had it id recommend trying it. But i dont really see myself picking this up.

A decent amount of lacing lines the glass.  Aroma: Earthy and hoppy, with a strong scent of pine. Smells kind of like a forest actually.  Taste: Definitely hop forward. Very bold on the tongue. bitter but not overly so.  Mouthfeel: Much smoother than I expected, with light carbonation on the back of the tongue. Very crisp.  Overall: I did not expect Dogfish Head to disappoint, and it didn't. I have a lot of respect for those who attempt to recreate beers of the distant past. Anthropological geniuses!

10099,6108,Auraan,4.39,"Poured a clear amber body with three fingers of foamy, thick white head that receded slowly to a ring of lacing. It looks like a rather nice IPA, quite enticing. Scents of citrus zest upfront quickly leading into vegetal, earthy, dank hops, light pine resin, hints of juniper berry and sour, wild red berries, floral hop aromas and a distinct backbone of bready, biscuit-like malt with some light sweetness. Overall impression of aroma is of a very nice, rather complex IPA done in the East Coast style with less overt pine, citrus and none of the tropical fruit seen in West Coast examples. This makes it pleasantly balanced yet still quite hoppy and very nice. Flavor begins with medium-high bitterness, beginning with flavors of citrus zest and light amounts of pine resin before moving into bitter, earthy, dank, herbal hop flavors. Middle is high in bitterness with a pronounced floral character, with notes of citrus blossom and jasmine. Finish is high in bitterness with notes of pine resin, bitter herbal hops and light notes of floral hops, again mostly citrus blossom. Light berry-like notes appear in the middle and even less on the finish. A lightly sweet and bready malt backbone is discernible throughout, continuing into the aftertaste. The aftertaste begins with a light bready malt flavor that quickly gives way to bitter hop flavors. Overall impression of flavor is of a nicely hoppy IPA that has a nice level of bitterness, but also a good depth and complexity of floral, fruity, herbal and resinous flavors to make it intriguing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation and a smooth, oily, resinous slickness. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a good IPA, classic and true to style. Overall this is a fantastic American IPA. It keeps away from the overwhelming maltiness that damages some East Coast examples, keeping hop character high, all the while maintaining a distinct identity from the West Coast hop bombs. A balanced and well executed beer on all counts and quite worth the price point.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,boodz85,4.55,"Excellent IPA, definitely one of my favorites. A lot more drinkable than a lot of IPA's with an aftertaste that is smooth with a subtle hoppy bite and not overbearing.

At 6% ABV this one feels like a session, although, after finishing one, you realize the one gave you a nice little buzz. Overall, a great IPA from DFH, one of the truly great breweries around.

10099,6108,PhilHeinricke,4.33,"Every year Terry has a Christmas party. It's always been a great party. They have all the party favorites, chips, crackers, veggie platter, homemade crab dip, as well as ham, poultry, mac n' cheese, all kinds of desserts. She's not a very good cook. I went early one time to help set up, and I witnessed them pouring a box of mashed potato flakes into a pot. Mashed potatoes from a box. Surrender Dorothy.  But since Terry got married to George, they've had a keg there. Last year they had Heineken. I'm not a big fan. But this year George had a quarter-keg of this wonderful liquid. Pouring it into a glass, I wouldn't describe it as ""pale"". It's a darker, more reddish color. But it has the wonderful taste of pale ale. I love IPA. I wasn't the only one who loved this. That quarter-keg was dry before 11 p.m.  One of Terry and George's neighbors is a man who married a Korean woman. Her 22 year old niece was visiting, and she came to the party. She was a little shy and didn't know anyone. Terry's daughters were all busy with their friends so I basically had the undivided attention of this ""adorkable"" little Korean science geek.

10099,6108,Jonoesh5,4.23,"Last of a 6-pack bottled on 09/14/17. Pours a beautiful orange copper translucent body with 1/2 inch head. Smell is crisp hops, biscuit, and spices. First sip is fruit punch and green pepper. Everything is flavorful, crisp, and clean. As the beer warms, the biscuity malt backbone shines through. Much more balanced than other hoppy IPAs. Mouthfeel is creamy and velvety.  Overall, a lovely, balanced brew! I hardly seek out IPAs because they're everywhere, but this Dogfish brew stands above the rest. I'm biased towards Dogfish, but 60 Minute really excels in each category.

It has a gorgeous, deep orange-gold body and great head retention with sticky lacing throughout. The aroma is sensually floral and citrusy but reminded me of catching wafts of fresh-baked cookies from three rooms away at home: nostalgia in a bottle.

10099,6108,LiquidAmber,4.11,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger slightly off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of bready, slightly caramel malt, grassy hops with light pine, citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor is dominated by resiny pine and citrus hops with a bit of hay, citrus rind and mild malt. Finishes with well balanced citrus and resinous piney hop bitterness. Medium bodied with good carbonation. This was one of my breakthrough IPAs back in the day and I approached this bottle with a little trepidation. There have been some awesome IPAs produced in the interim, and I am frequently slightly underwhelmed by East Coast IPAs now, preferring the West Coast hop varieties. No need to worry, this has held up well, still an excellent flavor blend of hops, nice assertive hop bitterness and a neutral, but supportive malt body. One of the classic IPAs.

Smells first of bread and malt, but subtle notes of citrus (lemon mostly) come through at the end. Taste is of the malt/breadiness at firSt, but a piney/citrusy taste dominates at the end as with most IPAs the taste is a bit better than the aroma in my opinion.

10099,6108,SmashPants,4.23,"Bottle: a thick dark brown embossed 355mL bottle with a decent label.  Appearance: pours a rich golden amber colour with fantastic carbonation spilling from the centre of the glass. A thick off-white head hangs about at one-finger and settles to a solid and rocky half-finger. Great lacing too - looks brilliant.  Aroma: plenty of pine and citrus hops per the style, with some tropical fruits. Refreshing, if not mind-blowing.  Taste: the pine and some woody resin take the fore here, with tropical fruits and some brown sugar sweetness. Definitely an emphasis on the pine and citrus hops though.  Aftertaste: plenty of hop bitterness with some of the wood resin also. Lovely.  Mouth feel: moderate in body with a fiarly high carbonation to carry the flavours. Pretty much spot-on.  Overall: this is my first Dogfish Head IPA, and it doesn't disappoint. Well combined and true to the American IPA, just a bit crisper and cleaner than some others. It is still hard to justify the price, with the best I found being AU$140 a case of 24 x 355mL.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Lacing, surprisingly, is weak. Smell - more earthy hops, pine, herbal; some candy malt notes. The herbal/grass nose after the bottle is finished is always a bonus for me! Taste - earthy hop flavor with subtle malt backing. Not bursting with flavor, but this grows on you quickly and it's hard to stop sipping! Feel - very well balanced, though the finish is hop bitterness; incredibly easy to drink! Overall - somehow one of the most iconic IPAs has eluded me for this long; well worth the wait!

Big white foam head giving about three fingers and retaining well. Leaves a good amount of lacing.  Smell: An earthy, juicy, and fairly spicy hop forward aroma with good hints of citrus fruit and grass. Upfront citrus hops with juicy hints of orange peel, grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, mango, and melon. Good mix of floral, herbal, and earthy hops with a scent of grass and some pine resin. Solid sweet malt backing with hints of caramel, grains, biscuit, cracker, and yeast. A pretty solid aroma.  Taste: Like the aroma, a nicely juicy, earthy, and spicy hop driven taste with good notes of citrus fruit, grass, and pine. Juicy taste of citrus hops with notes of grapefruit, orange peel, pineapple, lemon, mango, and melon. Earthy and floral hops with some good notes of damp grass, pine resin, and spice.

10099,6108,StoneTSR,4.13,"Bottled on Date: 6/25/14  A: The most notable, visible trait if this beer is it's impressive head retention - a full finger of pretty and stark-white, foam sits on top and remains intact throughout most of the glass. Underneath it lies a bright, orange beer with tiny bubbles slowly climbing up the outer edges of the beer and larger ones darting to the top in the center. Lacing is gorgeous and thick.  S: Orange stands out the most in this very citrusy nose. Other citrus notes (grapefruit in particular) and pine round it out.  T: The reason people love this beer is because it provides everything an IPA should. It starts out like a blend of citrus juices, but the end of each sip provides a solid, bitter bite. Somewhere along the way a little hint of pine transitions into a little grassy, hoppy note to bridge the gap.  M: Light to medium bodied, actually maybe more medium-bodied, but by IPA standards today it leans light. For those familiar with 90 Minute, it's little brother is far more dry, especially on the finish.  O: This is a highly drinkable beer.At 6% it's almost sessionable these days.

10099,6108,AngryPenguinBrewCo,3.66,"First off I want to point out that it is possible that the kegs I drank this from may not have been at optimal freshness. I had this at a bar in JFK airport in NY, and then later that night at the bar at the Hilton in Florida. Poured beautiful and golden brown from the tap, with a thick and creamy 2 finger head. The lacing on the glass was incredible and was still present when our server took the empty glass. The aroma I experienced was of muted pine and sweet malt. As for taste, I wasn't overly impressed; mostly sweet bready malts with some piney hop flavors. Overall I found a severe lack of hop flavor and an overwhelming malt presence, not the sort of balance I expected given all the hype surrounding this beer.

Lacing makes no qualms about grasping to the side of the glass and hanging around like has nothing else better to do.  Smell - Juicy citrus notes abound - fresh orange with light grapefruit zest and maybe even a faint whiff of lemon.  Taste - Flavor is a bit more tame, but still manages some nice character. Orange notes are predominant, with touches of mint leaf and light pith bitterness in the finish. Malts are faint, but very generic, like white bread.  Mouthfeel - Medium in body with fair carbonation. A touch velvety with nice smoothness.  Overall - Really nice, smooth drinking beer.

As other reviewers have noted, this is more sessionable than the 90 min IPA, but less assertive/exciting. Also, the faint citrus sweetness, and noticeable malt backbone, give this beer character but also somewhat detract from the purity of the IPA.

Smell: A blast of citrus and pine hops, very floral and inviting.  Taste: A blast of hops goodness right up front with some bitterness, but it is immediately smoothed out by the malty backbone to finish clean and mellow.  Mouth feel: Crisp and good carbonation. Finishes slightly dry and crisp on the tongue, but not bitter.  Overall: I prefer the 90-Minute Imperial IPA bt Dogfish Head, but this one is just as tasty and more sessionable at the 6.0 ABV.

10099,6108,ThisWangsChung,3.54,"Re-review - this one hits home in particular because it's the first beer I've ever properly reviewed. 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a golden amber color. The head is a finger high, with an eggshell shade. Retention wise, it's really good for the style - only now has it faded into a thin film. Lacing is very sticky and persistent on the sides of the glass.  S: At first, it seems faintly orange-like. Let it open up in the glass, and it transforms into the quintessential east-coast IPA: lots of piny/floral hops, minor citrus notes, and a rather nutty malt backbone with that's quite rich for IPAs. As with 90 Minute, there was real care put into the malt notes - it isn't like a typical west-coast IPA (where the malts are muted to showcase the hops better) or even a typical east-coast IPA (where there's an amorphous blob of crystal malts hammering the nose/palate for the sake of 'balance') Also like 90 Minute, I could use more hops. Nonetheless it's a balanced IPA done right.  T: Not as piny as the nose indicated. There's a good blend of orange-y hops at first, giving way to a nutty, caramely maltiness. It finishes with some hints of brown sugar. I like the hop flavors of this beer - unfortunately, they're overshadowed by the malt backbone. Ramp up the hops 15% or so, and this will become genuinely great.  M: The crisp bite I like in a good IPA is there, but perhaps it's too sweet on the finish. Perhaps my ass - it IS too sweet, and too syrupy as well. It really goes against the light crispness initially featured (but wow, is the first half of this beer friggen' easy to crush!) Plus the carbonation seems timid, which does the sweetness no favors.  O: I keep overlooking this beer as a sort of 'protest' against DFH's wont to create moon dust and wasabi beers, but among the plethora of balanced east-coast IPAs, this one is pretty damn good. Personally, the hop/malt balance is skewed too much to the latter for me. But I can't deny this is a fantastic IPA to cut your teeth on (I should know - a bought a case of this stuff 3 years ago just for that intent).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell- Sweet malt not unlike that of fresh dough. Grapefruit citrus as well.  Taste- The sweetness of the smell comes early in the taste as well. This malty sweetness evolves into an earthy pine flavor that ends with a crisp bitter hop finish. Not much in the way of bitterness and more sweet compared to the myriad of counterparts.  Mouthfeel- On the medium side but lively to the palate. Carbonation is spot on.  Overall- A very refreshing IPA. One of the lighter ones, but wow is this easy drinking.

This is probably my favorite component of this beer.  Taste: Balanced between citrus and bready malts, but the flavors are very subtle from what I'm used to from an AIPA. More like a pale ale.  Mouthfeel: Light medium with great drinkability.  Overall: This was one of my first craft beers and used to think this was a total hop bomb. Funny how things have changed. The overall aspects of this beer are great, but I am left with more pronounced flavors to be desired. If this were labeled as a pale ale, I would've given a higher score.

Then the actual IPA feel comes in with citrus hops, orange peel, banana string, classic burnt malts, toast, and a bit of caramel on the back end (faint though).  M: Light side of medium. Carbonation is a nice touch.  O: This is an awesome and refreshing beer. Not so much an IPA as I would have expected it to be honest, more like a regular pale ale, but very good.

10099,6108,ThePaintedGrey,4.18,"12oz. bottle poured into standard bar pint glass. Re-Reviewing based on a second session.  A: Pours a hazy amber hue with a little bit of yeast sediment floating around. A large frothy white head eventually dwindles down some, but displays excellent retention. Massive amounts of sticky lace down the glass. This one is much prettier to look at the second time around thanks to a more conscious pour.  S: Some floral hops with a bit of grapefruit citrus zest. A little bit of earthy pine and some understated malt sweetness.  T: Lots of fresh flowery hop flavor, with a just as dominating citrus profile: grapefruit and orange or tangerine. A little bit of earthy yeast melds well with the malty background, doing a great job of balancing out the palette-kicking bitterness. Extremely well-balanced throughout. I'm pleased to say that the flavor profile this time around absolutely coincides with my previous session. A complex, consistent brew.  M: A relatively full-body makes sure this brew hits every nook and cranny in your mouth with each sip. A crisp, but not overly-aggressive, carbonation does well and doesn't get in the way of the overall creamy texture. Unrivaled session potential.  O: Dogfish Head has definitely set the standard for what an IPA should be. This beer is consistently outstanding all across the board, with no aspects of it truly outshining another. It's just pure, unadulterated hoppy greatness that drinks smooth and always satisfies. This brew has unmatched staying power.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,falloutsnow,4.31,"From: Piccadilly, Champaign, IL Date: Bottled 2014-01-10 Glass: Ayinger pils glass  Dogfish Head's 60-minute IPA is a wonderfully bright and fruity IPA in the US tradition of the style. With expressive tropical and citrus fruit flavors melded with malt sweetness and hop bitterness, this is an easy choice for a hop-heavy and well-executed beer. One I would get again.  Pours a 1.5cm tall head of slightly off-white foam, with retention above average at two minutes, eventually descending to a thick ring around the perimeter of the glass and a thin cap of film resting atop the body of the beer for the duration of the drink. Lacing is excellent, with thick washes clinging to all sides of the glass. Beer's body is a bright golden orange color, with light bringing out rich golden yellow hues. Carbonation visible through the transparentn body, moderate in number and activity.  Aroma is pleasantly sweet and fruity, of grapefruit, mango, peaches, lemon, and pine, at times coming across as slightly ""dank.""  Overall flavor is similar to aroma, with sweet, tropical and citrus fruit flavors, well-integrated bitterness, and a pleasing malt sweetness blending it all together. Front of palate tastes sweetness from pale and slight caramel malt, joined to strong fruit flavors of mango, peaches, and more subtle grapefruit. Mid-palate experiences continued strong fruit flavors: mango, peach, grapefruit, lemon, guava, with a hint of pine and moderate-intensity bitterness. Back of palate detects strong upfront bitterness, but not overwhelming, mixed with more reduced fruity hop flavors (still mango, peach, grapefruit, guava, and lemon) and a hint of sweetness in the background.  Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-high intensity, resulting in a balanced smooth and foamy (50% each) mouthfeel. This works for this beer and in the style as a whole: enough carbonation to move the beer across the palate, but not too much to undermine the sweetness and flavors of the beer. Closes dry, with medium-high stickiness clinging to the palate and lips.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Nicely sweet and moderately bitter. Has that moderately dry, moderately bitter, clean flavor that I really like in hoppy beers. Nothing sharp or offensive, save the expected bitter bite.

Agitating 60 Minute gives off some sweet citrus aromas and a little caramel malt.  60 Minute starts off with herbal flavors and some earthiness. The finish has the orange that was perceptible on the nose, but here that flavor is incredibly light. More of the tea flavors abound as well. This drinks like an English IPA.  This IPA has a medium body with okay creaminess. It runs watery over the tongue, but balances out nicely.  60 Minute is a well crafted beer, and the English IPA flavors make for an easy drinker.

S- Healthy aroma if piney hops, citrus, dank resin, and light sweet malt.  T- Extremely floral and minty hop profile, almost reminiscent of eucalyptus and cat pee (but in a good way!), grapefruit rind, and mango, balanced by a honey graham cracker backbone. The sweeter malt compliments the hop bill very well.  M- Lighter bodied, with prickly carbonation. Drying finish. A little lighter body than I usually prefer in my IPAs, but it works here.  O- A nicely done yet accessible IPA, and it's easy to see why it is so popular amongst IPA fans. Nothing revolutionary here, but I have had many of these and will continue doing so. Very solid and well balanced.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Nice lingering balance of bitterness and sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Creamy with crisp carbonation. Oily, sticky coating left behind with a soft lingering bitterness and citrus sweetness.

Crisp hoppy lemony alchohol smell that is not as pleasant as some IPA's, but not overpowering and easy to get past to take the first sip. Definitely an IPA as it hits your tounge wit a bitter bite that finishes with fermented lemony aftertaste. Slightly thin that make drinking easy on a sunny afternoon. Not my favorite, and not the quality nor value I was hoping to enjoy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,DeFaz,4.3,"This beer deserves to be reviewed for what it is. It doesn't aim to look up to its older brothers 90 minute and 120 minute. It's content being the lighter session IPA, and I love drinking it.  The beer a golden/orange color with a foamy head that displays fantastic retention and sticky lacing. The smell is complex--the hops provide some citrus and pine aromas, but the malt also adds bread and other scents I couldn't identify. The taste is complex and delicious. The taste is oily from the hops, and yet there's the bread flavor from the malt that reminds me a bit a nice amber ale. And, the yeast adds some additional complexity that challenges my palate (in a good way).  The mouthfeel is on the thinner side, as it needs to be for a session IPA, and the carbonation keeps this crisp without going overboard. Overall, this is easily one of the most drinkable IPAs one can find while still offering an impressive flavor profile. This really is a beer that one could drink any day of the year and not be disappointed. Again, this isn't supposed to compete with the 120 minute IPA for hop flavor, but instead is supposed to offer a great alternative for someone looking for a session beer, and this succeeds wonderfully.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,brurevu,4.16,My gateway IPA. The IPA poured a golden orange with an off white head. There were plenty of citrus notes in the aroma that followed through to the taste. The hoppy flavors were well balanced with a malty backbone which could explain my ease into this IPA. The citrusy hops began my passion and the creamy mouthfeel kept me coming back. After trying many other IPA's I still find the Dogfish 60 Minute IPA is a great IPA and perfect standard bearer for the style.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Very refreshing.  m: Light and crisp.  o: Still excellent with some age on it, very easy drinking, hard to imagine a better IPA on a hot summer day, but it's no slouch in the Fall either.

It has a strong, bold flavor, with a bit of grapefruit bitterness. The appearance was rich, the taste forceful, and the feel deep and profound. Rich depth and bitter edge make this an ideal choice for one's regular beer. I found the taste strong without being overpowering: strong, edgy bitterness with a bit of citrus, but multi-faceted and balanced. I'm anxious to try the 90 and 120 on another occasion. My score is 92 for this one. Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Well the beer pours a vibrant amber colour with a two-finger beige head. Standard sort of pour for a North American IPA.  The aroma is hoppy and quite floral with a little hint of citrus fruit in the back. I also picked up a little tobacco aroma - very unusual to say the least.  The taste is really not as hoppy as most Canadian IPAs I've had; the bitterness level is quite toned down. I'm certainly picking up an almost orange-like taste in the back of my throat. The drink finishes very cleanly with no unpleasant aftertaste on my tongue.  Standard stuff.

There is a good deal of bitterness typical with an IPA, but an unusual sweet maltyness which i would be lying if i said was not the most enjoyable part of this beer.

As if anything I said could add to the description of this iconic IPA. I do think the use of Amber malt is sneaky. Something I would have never thought to put in an IPA. Then again when this beer came out there was not much else around. Hell, I can remember trying it nearly two decades ago. Hanging out with friends, cooking up some food, listening to the blues and having a good time.  Firm bitterness gives way to that sneaky amber malt followed by the orange hop flavor. Not exactly a got to for me these days, but does bring back some memories of days gone by.  This beer stands the test of time.

Pours a darker-straw color, very clear, kind of weak head, but it's there. Smell is nice, herbal hops, with a bit of skunk. Taste is similar. Nice hoppy flavor, but not over-stated! Mouthfeel is good. All in all, a solid, tasty IPA that's readily available for a decent price. Having had a bunch of this stuff though, I'd say it's only worth buying when it's fresh. It falls off pretty quickly and there's a lot of old 60 min sitting around out there...

The pine and citrus from the nose shine right through to the taste. Always satisfying.  M - Mouthfeel is where the dry hop shines through. Good carbonation.  O – Always partial to a good DFH beer.

Some grapefruit and orange up front, then turning into more tropical notes and the back of the tongue.  This one is very easy to drink, light bodied, there is a bit of dryness in the finish.

Smell could be stronger, but is on par with the taste in terms of punch.  T - It shines here as a beer that can be drank on a hot summer day as well as a cool fall day. I don't find myself having it as much in the spring or winter, but its medium bodied, crisp, citrusy clean flavor is good in any season. Very hoppy at first, but gets milder quickly as you dig in. Best drank very cold.  M - Again, medium-bodied. It's a very versatile beer and stays light on your palette while retaining a hoppy punch and a refreshing level of carbonation.

10099,6108,BethanyB,3.34,"Appearance: Clarity was brilliant, color was a pale gold. The head was substantial, creamy, and true white in color. Carbonation was evident, but not on excess, as far as the eye could see.  Smell: I found the bouquet to be surprisingly dull. Not only that, but there was a sulfuric aroma that, while hardly overpowering, could not be ignored. Hops were present, but were not of the resiny, in-your-face American quality I was expecting (there was a bit of citrus, however). I was also surprised by the level of maltiness in comparison to the other qualities. A toasty malt seemed to be at nearly the same level as the hops each time I sniffed.  Taste: Bitterness was less prominent than that of other IPAs, and in terms of the finish, vanished from the palette quite quickly. There was a round, toasty maltiness that, while tasty, seemed out of place for the style. A bit of citrus tang made for a nice touch.  Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel, with moderate carbonation. No more, no less.  Overall: So sessionable, it was almost disappointing. This beer reminded me more of an amber ale than an IPA. The Bronx Pale Ale I had before it was considerably more hoppy, in terms of both smell and taste.

So I'll review #2  Pint delivered to the table. Small slightly fluffy head, which didn't retain much. Lacing was good though. Body a clear pale amber color.  Not an awful lot on the nose hops, citrus, and a whiff of something I wasn't able to identify.  Taste is just outstanding though. Smooth, hops come through nicely with a bit of a bite, but doesn't hang around forever on the tongue. Extremely drinkable and sessionable at 6.0.  Mouth is medium, very easy on the tongue.  Overall, this is a beer I've had many times, and finally got around to reviewing. I must admit, I appreciate it much more now than I did in earlier years.

O - I would definitely seek this out again. I've had a fair number of IPAs in the past few months, and this might be one of my favorites.

Too reedy, fall earth, and tidewater for my taste, even tho I am a tide water guy.  Appearance: For me this now pours a clear amber with a dense white head that dissipates into an islands atop the beer; a bit of lacing.  Smell: Plenty aroma where citrus hops dominate, followed by cookie dough, crackery, malt and a bit of wet woods and alcohol.  Taste: Follows the smell but in reverse order, begins cookie / crackery malt base, though not sweet at all; then citrusy, piney bitter hops kick, and take you to the lovely long finish. Great with cheese and dinner. easy to enjoy. Good starter IPA, but a bit of tidewater stink and long fall reedy islands.  Mouthfeel: Medium to light, nicely carbonated.

Orange and grapefruit peel, pine needles, resin, white flowers, dates, ginger, graham crackers on the nose. The pine and resin are not the full volume approach that many West Coast Style IPAs showcase. Nice balance.  Malt notes fade quickly, light biscuit, caramelized orange peel, light floral notes. The hops quickly suck up the rest of the profile on the palate, leaving you with just the hops. Again, hops are not out of control on the volume side of things. Finish lingers in subtlety for some time.  Medium bodied, clean and nice balance in the beer's carbonation.  It's an interesting approach. I wished for more on the palate, but I liked the fact that while the hops are very much in the beer, they are not muscling everything else out of the nose and even on the palate, where they do take over, they are not at a volume that is overpowering to the senses.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Looking forward to the 90, 75, & 120 minute IPA!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,1sophrosyne1,3.87,"Poured into a goblet and enojyed over 40 minutes. The least appealing feature of this beer is its look. It's a misty orange color with an off white head that leaves fair lacing. It certainly smells vibrant and stylistically correct--a blend of citrus, just enough pine, and a nice dose of malty toffee fill up the nose well. Nicely floral with warmth, as well. Bitter right up front with a host of other chewy tastes, including those ascorbic fruits and a spicy earth. The balance is very nice, but unfortunately, it all goes away too fast as a result of the lack of length. Even when room temperature, only a bit more grassy aftertaste lasts. Fairly hefty body and a nice buzz of carbonation. But it doesn't linger as long as I'd wish for all the potential flavors in the splendid hops and malt to unfurl. This is a very good regular offering in the IPA world. In contrast to many of the creative-beyond-reason products coming out of this brewery, the 60 minute is a consistent classic that I'll return to regularly. Despite some component deficits, this is a very enjoyable craft.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Hazy. 2-finger off white head, this fades to a bubbly, 1-finger cap. Good lacing.  The citrus notes (orange, lemon) are predominant, but there is a very pleasant (faint) floral aroma. This is not piney, which I appreciate. Vigorous swirl unearths the malt backbone. The malt reminiscent of 120-Min actually.  Malt sweetness at first, giving way to a solid, crisp (not overpowering at all) hop bitterness. A bit light on the flavor, the lone ""weakness.""  Dry finish with a creamy mouthfeel.  This was really refreshing on a hot night. I see why this is a touchstone IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The pine and citrus compliment each other so well. The malt backbone stands on its own and adds the harmony desired. M: 4.5 carbed appropriately, leaves a slight dry after taste.

I enjoy the inviting floral hopped aroma intermixed with pale malts and biscuit. It is not too pungent like a lot of American IPA's can be.  The body is light to medium with a notable creaminess to the texture.  The taste is where the hops take off. I get a wonderful sweetness with the first sip but then it quickly evolves into a piney, floral hop bitterness that ends a tad on the dry side. I can see why this one gets such high ratings. It is exquisite.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,BeerDocT,3.74,"Appearance 3.25: Poured out a standard golden color with a smallish head (under 1/4""). Lots of CO2 bubbles and a swirly foam left on top after the pour.  Smell 3.5: Very nice bouquet featuring a piney, alkaline, grapefruit bouquet. This bouquet is subdued, meaning that it is not a huge beta hop punch in the nose. However, this subdued bouquet is the primary bouquet and is not (to my nose) enhanced by other familiar beer scents, which was a bit disappointing.  Taste 4.0: Front is dry and filled with an alakaline hop punch. Middle is dry, mellow and filled with nice and refreshing grapefruit, pine, rosin and many other wonderful hop tastes. I detect chinook, columbus...very nice. Finish is where a pleasant maltiness seeps in and is offset by more hop alkaline goodness. Aftertaste features very pleasant hop alkaline tastes merged with a subtle malty sweetness. However, this ""sweetness"" is similar to residual sugar tastes in a fine wine; i.e., not sweet at all, just a taste illusion.  Mouthfeel: 3.5: Carbonation level is average for this style of beer.  Overall 3.75: Very good IPA. The overwhelming impression is that of dryness and hops, but this beer is imminently sessionable and rewarding. I did consider this brew to be incomplete, because of the appearance and the bouquet. However, it is an excellent tasting IPA (my overall score notwithstanding) and is definitely worth picking up if you have not trie it previously.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

O- I actually prefer this in a lot of ways to the dfh 90 min - I love that the green hoppiness stays with me until the end this beer just makes me want to grill fish and sit outside.

10099,6108,BradtheGreat7,4.16,Review taken from notes over a course of multiple times having this. Particular review was taken a week ago: June 2013 along with past notes.  12 oz brown bottle with tan label DFH style almost looking like a rocks scattered along the banks of a river. It has a brilliant green color that pairs nicely with the artwork. Poured into a DFH pint glass.  A - golden like color with hints of orange to light copper. Crystal clear body. A frothy white head hangs around before a plump ring of lace takes over. Lots of stickiness.  S - wow. An excellent balance of aroma. A touch of pine resin and lemongrass. Hops don't stop there as a firm grapefruit whiff hits the nose. Ripe fruits sit in before a caramel and toasted bread like malt balance the entire aroma.  T - hops are more floral in the flavor with light pine and soft grapefruit. Caramel malt again shows the balance near effortlessly. A little touch of spice creeps up from the hops in the finish.  M - a true smooth drinker. Oily and sticky in the mouth and let's me enjoy the experience. Coats the mouth the way an ipa should without beating the feel up with any sort over powering dominance. This is a great session ale for me.  O - the first time I had 60 minute i fell in love with its balance all while getting a quick hop fix. It's a true classic from DFH and really sets the tone for what their style is all about. A good intro into the world of unique Dogfish brews. It's a must try for any craft beer lover and one you'll have again and again.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

That being said, take this review for what it's worth - my attempt to capture thoughts on a beer I don't have access to at home.  Transparently orange-gold never looked so good - fluffy white head leaves lace, even on this hotel cup.  Piney, some pineapple and a hint of citrus - folks, the glass does make a difference, because hotel quality doesn't cut it, limiting the beer's ability to deliver its full punch to the nose.  Well-balanced, with a slightly bracing lead of hoppiness - pine, pineapple and a backend of malty nuttiness.  Easy drinking.

Aroma is extremely dry and astringent, with heavy pepper. Dose of wheat or rye malts comes through. Very minor floral or citrus aroma from flavoring hops.  Taste is more even than the aroma. Spice, pepper, tobacco, wheat, and rye; some slight grapefruit rind; mostly dry hops.  Extremely smooth and drinkable. Mild carbonation sting; lively beer.  This beer doesn't seem to be as good as when I first tried it. Maybe it's my expectations for an IPA. It pairs very well with food, and makes a very solid choice for an every day IPA or a substitute for light lagers, but ultimately, there are tastier IPAs out there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

M: Clean and smooth, finishes with a nice alcoholic dryness and no sugary sweet taste.  O: A very well balanced beer.

The aroma is of sweet, sugary medium-roasted barley malt, with a faint presence of hop oil. Taste is of those things, plus the beer has a strong, yet not harsh, hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and soft, and Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA finishes dry, refreshing, and easy drinking. Overall, I prefer a harsher hop attack, but this beer is still most excellent.

The aroma evokes the scent of sweet baked goods, along with a pleasing pine fragrance. With a sip, I find it toasty, bready, as well as nutty, buttery, and sweet. The lemon/citrus hop flavors come in and initially are not too bitter...until the finish kicks in with a harsher and dryer wave washing over the palate. It's a medium feeling beer and totally drinkable. An iconic IPA, this is one of the beers that made me fall in love with the style and craft beer in general. For fans of the style with a bit of a malt balance, it's the 'all day' IPA before Founders coined the term.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Aromas of pineapple and pine trees. A nice bready sweet malt complements the hops.  T-The hops in the taste are more pine tree and less pineapple like which gives off a bit of a resiny, bitter finish. The malt takes a back seat but is clean, fresh bread like with a bit of sweetness and carries the beer nicely.  M-Nice rich malt body to complement the ample hops. Medium carbonation.

This brew is balanced extremely well and makes it a great intro IPA.  M: Slight carbonation. Nothing special but nothing bad either. Just a standard beer as far as mouthfeel is concerned.  Overall, one of the best introductory IPA's I've had.

This is a good beer and it introduced some flavors I had not yet experienced. For an IPA, this has a floral and citrus sweetness that is well balanced with the slight hop bitterness. It's not a complicated beer. No, it's a good spring beer. Its taste reminds me of fresh cut grass and budding flowers.

10099,6108,THErealDK,5,"Dogfish head makes great beers, but I must say they nailed it with their IPAs. Over all I enjoyed everything about this beer.  A: This brew has a creamy white head that will start at about an quarter of an inch and decrease to about half that. As I drank this brew, the head would stick to the glass, and become almost sticky. The brew itself is a nice deep amber color with a nice amount of carbonated bubbles.  S: The smell is what you would expect from an IPA, with a nice hoppy aroma. It gives off a nice citrusy, and grassy aroma that balances with the flavor very well.  T: The over all taste is what sets this IPA apart from the rest, much like its bigger brothers this is a well balanced brew. Not too bitter, the hops seem to be balanced well allowing this IPA to be a great started for anyone venturing into the IPA world.  Overall this is one of the greats, I recommend this beer for anyone including those who tend to stray from IPAs. I recommend pulling a bottle out and letting it sit on the counter for 15 - 30 minutes, pour into a glass at room temperature and enjoy. For about $10 - $12 bucks for a six pack you cant go wrong.

Aroma: Some light malt aroma (bread, biscuit) and very light sweetness barely perceived. A spicy hop aroma dominates but is not overpowering.  Flavor: Light body carries a slight sweetness. There is a firm bitterness early in the sample that fades quickly to a ""darker green"" hop flavor that lingers. Hops taste citrusy upon warming.  Mouthfeel: Very light body with med. carbonation. Either hop bite or alcohol leaves solventy note in throat.  Overall: Light body keeps this quite drinkable and hop progression is interesting, but not overpowering.

T: Hops hit you front and center; Followed by a subtle biscuit tone, and then a resinous hop punch at the end, very complex and delicious.  M: Very crisp and clean. No cloying stickiness you usually get from a well hopped ale. Nice carbonation and very smooth, nothing negative about this whatsoever. (and this is my pickiest category.)  O: I truly love this beer. This is the beer that really got me into craft beers. I love that it's as hoppy and assertive as it is, but is in my opinion the most sessionable beer in it's category.

M - Light, crisp, with just the right amount of carbonation  O - While I prefer the 90 minute IPA, this one is no slouch. This would be a great beer to drink while playing cards with your buds. Some might think this is basically the ""light"" version of DFH's minute series, but I see this brew as standing alone from the others.

O- Average sums it up. it has some of the bitter hops that IPA lovers desire, but it lacks any outstanding flavor. That being stated, it is easy to drink and could be a good hot summer day selection. I would call it a good IPA for beginners.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

It had some decent biscuit malt like flavor in it. There's a nice fresh cut grass taste from the hops .Citrus hops were also very present and gave the beer a nice bitterness but not too overpowering.  M: Finishes clean and pretty dry too. Not to thin or too thick. Maybe a little bit highly carbonated. Very drinkable and drinker friendly.  O: I have been waiting a long time to get this in Canada and I'm pretty happy I tried it.

One inch head, and good sheets of lacing down the glass.  Smells like a perfect mix of citrusy and piney hops. A little bit of malt sweetness is noted.  The taste is similar. A bit of rough but pleasant bitterness, and lots of piney goodness, a little bit flora, with some citrus sweetness. There's some sweet biscuity malt noticed underneath the hop goodness.  Medium bodied, very crisp, delicious mouthfeel. Medium carbonation.  This is their flagship, and it shows that they can both brew normal, simple kick-ass beers and brew big weird awesome beers.

Ale is clean and clear...slightly lighter in color than the 90 minute IPA. Great retention with good lacing. Great looking beer  S- Citrus hop aroma- grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, lemon. Pine notes in the back. Quite aromatic. Strong hop profile  T- Grapefruit flavors up front. Also detect some grassy notes. Balance seems to be a little off IMO. Much more harsh than i expected. Lots of spicy notes that I don't normally see in an IPA. Finish has a strong bite and bitterness that lingers. The malt base showed through for just a fraction of a second and then quickly disappeared. I would have loved for it to have hung around longer.  M- Mid bodied. Great carbonation. Dry finish. Drinkability is average.  O- I expected more. I have had a 90 minute before and it was one of my favorite IPAs ever. Maybe i just expected too much from this beer. Looked good, smelled good, tasted unbalanced. It was drinkable, but unremarkable given the the vast amount of IPAs that have developed today. I am a self proclaimed hop head, and while the hops were apparent, they weren't complex and the malt body didn't match the hop intensity. The harshness of this beer was tough to look past. Maybe my palate has become too accustom to the huge flavors and complexities of imperial IPAs.  I will try again in the future. I understand that this beer is well received, and maybe i just got a bad batch. Would like to try on tap.  $11.49 for a 6 pk",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

A- Pours a Deep straw gold with a rather small white head that reduces down to a medium sized collar with a good amount of lacing on the inner surface. This is a surprisingly clean and clear looking beer. It almost makes up for its odd lack of head.  S- The beer gives off a very distinct cracker like aroma that I assume is created from the blending of the spiciness of the hops and the breadiness of the malts. A bit buttery, with a slight fruitiness from the hops as well that give off some light notes of citrus fruit and peach. Toasty grainy malts and spicy earthy hops.  T- Spicy cracker maltiness accompanied by a pleasant, piney, grassy hop bitterness. The malts blend in well with the spiciness of the hops in the finish, making it rather balanced.  M- Smooth with a rather lighter/light light medium body with an extra edge given to it by the carbonation.

Great color and head (which is the best tasting part) open up a to truly memorable drinking experience. Strong hops, citrus notes and a dry resin finish are all very pleasing, with sweetness levels being low, which is something I like to see in IPAs.

All pretty stand, but they come out pretty well.  Taste: The first thing I thought on this one going down was: ""WOW. This is a nice, hoppy IPA, but it has a great malt character holding it all up."" Malts couple well with the hops to give it a nice toasty undertone. Hops are there for sure, but they're not too overbearing. ""Pine"" taste is more prevalent than citrus. This would be great with a campfire. A sip of this is even better if you catch a good bit of the head.  Mouthfeel: This is a pretty sticky and somewhat oily mouthfeel.

Leaves a nice trail of lacing throughout with moderate retention. Smell is mostly citrus - lemon peel, grapefruit - along with a whiff of pine and some floral tones; also a hint of dry, biscuit that came from the malt component. As far as taste, this brew hits the spot - I'm a huge hophead. First thing I notice is the slightly bitter grapefruit, followed by the mellow, sweet malted barley. I think that this is a pretty earthy IPA too. Yes, the hops are prominent, but they lend a certain mellow/drinkable element to the overall composition. Feeling is great when you drink this beer; I have never sessionned with this beer, but while somewhat heavy, I found that it doesn't get old and filling as some do. It's lightly carbonated and each sip is as refreshing as the last.  Overall, I love this beer. In my opinion it is the near-perfect balance of hops, malt and drinkability that I think is extremely difficult to come by today.

Solid one inch bubbly cream head lingers, but will leave sheets of lacing.  Sweet bready malt forms the backbone of the aroma, slightly grainy. A strong whiff reveals large grapefruit and dank hop presence. Slightly skunky and oniony aromas emerge.  Flavor is initially a little malty, bready, and a touch sweet, but the hops kick in full force as a nice citrusy background, with grapefruit and sour lemon eventually disappearing and allowing the malt to resurface a touch drier and toastier. The finish has a hint of bitterness, but is not overpowering. There's a touch of onion, floral hops, and cattiness that emerge late.  Body is moderate, with carbonation on the slightly elevated side, allowing the hop character to be lifted from the palate.

10099,6108,jjamadorphd,4.12,"UPDATE: Now that I have tried several IPAs in the years since I have had a 60-minute from Dogfish Head, I have say, this is one of the more that appeals to me. This time, I had one out of the bottle, and I think it makes a whole bunch of difference to me. Great color and foamy head with staying power and lacing. I really enjoyed the citrusy notes in the smell of the brew and tasting it much better this time around. The bitterness that I complained so much about I actually have acquired a taste for (and this one is no where near as bad as some others I have had.) I've rated it a quite a bit higher this time, probably where it actually belong on my personal list.  Previous review below: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I had never heard of this beer until I saw a tap for it in a Crown Plaza Hotel, of all places. I had asked around and it was highly suggested - so here I go giving it a try. I honestly wasn't impressed.  The beer pours out a very appealing orangish-brown color with a foamy, white head. The head has staying power and the lacing sticks almost all the way to the bottom of the glass. The IPA has a strong orange smell too it, not so much that it over powers the hops, and the mouthfeel was better than most I have had lately.  This is where the disappointment comes in - the taste. Although I could taste the citrus in the beer, even some hints of honey, the hops brewed with this 60-minute process was way too overpowering for my taste. The stuff just tasted slightly metallic to me. Overall, I'm giving it a low score since it fell short in the most important of categories.  I'm sure others have enjoyed this brew, but for me, unless I cross paths with a bottled version to give it a try/chance, I think I'll pass.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,gcamparone,4.35,"Since Dogfish head decided to stop shipping to Rhode Island, I like to pick up a 6 pack of this stuff every time I visit Massachusetts.  A little side note: DFH 60 minute is the IPA that really turned me onto IPAs (had it on tap at Mews Tavern in Wakefield, RI) , so I am combining that first ""oh my god this is amazing"" feeling with this formal review, ~2 years later.  This time I poured it from a 12 oz bottle into a Samuel Adams pint glass:  A- Pours a golden clear body with a generous 3"" head that exhibits high retention. Reduces to some chunky white foam and leaves some heavy lacing.  S- Weed, citrus, resin, slight grapefruit, lightly toasted malt  T- I get a good fresh pine flavor followed by a citrus-caramel note for balance. Somewhat nutty. Leaves a subtle bitter hoppy flavor on the tongue.  M- Medium body, medium-low carbonation.  Overall a respectable classic in my opinion. Sessionable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,AmitC,4.35,"Finally i am having a dogfish head brew.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a large snifter.  Golden color. Very clear appearance. Half finger thick head of white color. Stands as a thin disc. Excellent lacing. Small bubbles.  Aroma: Piney hops with a lot of herbal weed presence. Smells a lot like wild weeds in the jungle and that is its point of distinction. If you give this to some beer novice, i am sure he won't drink it just after smelling it. I like the aroma. It is inviting, one-of-a-kind and intoxicating at the same time. Not a very strong aroma but very subtle and complex. You know, it could be any weed, but it is hops.  Taste: Malts upfront and bitter afterwards. Aftertaste is bitter in a distinct way. It really is a different brew. Very unlike any other IPA that i have tried so far, and i have tried quite a few. Not a lot of bitterness but for an AIPA it is just adequate. Dry bitter finish.  Mouth feel: Medium feel. Hop derived astringency that is mild for an hop lover and would be unbearable for a hopophobiac (that is a term i just coined). Moderate carbonation.  I like it just for its distinctiveness and i am ready to try its big brother that is waiting in my fridge.

10099,6108,tectactoe,4.1,"Pours a deep golden color with just a few tints of copper and orange when the light hits it - relatively bright white head that reduces to a thin sheet over the beer in a few minutes. Some of the most tremendous lacing I've ever seen - I could tell you how big each and ever sip was (I have a picture of the empty glass somewhere). Aromas are, of course, hop heavy; floral and citrus are the most prominent, slight pine in the background. Sweet malt detectable, providing a nice canvas for the hops to dance on. Some woody and wheat aromas come out as the beer warms up, but stay tertiary to the hops and malt.  Flavor is spot on, nice up-front bitterness from the hops, entwined with their own blend of citrus and grapefruit flavors. Light hop oils and some leafy presence, almost gray tea in character. Slight pepper in the background? Not sure about that one... Malt is secondary but still noticeable and definitely helpful, as it should be in an IPA. Sweetness plays around on the palate about halfway through and towards the end, however the lingering citrus and bitterness is the reminder left on your tongue. Alcohol plays a nice role in the warmth of the beer, remaining detectable but not hindering or unwelcome. Medium in body and carbonated generously.  This beer is a great IPA, plain and simple. Nothing too fancy or wacky, but executed superbly. At 6% ABV, it might be slightly high to session, but if you're feeling frisky - go for it. One of the first beers I recommend to my friends who are new to IPAs (and usually the world of craft beer), right before I bump them up to Two Hearted.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The traditional ( to me) tea / grapefruit taste at the start with well rounded bitters to finish. Aftertaste was the bitters subtly ending the drink.  Round mouthfeel.

T: A subtle mouthfeel in the beginning, quite smooth, and a strong bite of hop as it travels down the throat. Hops stay in the mouth until the next sip.

S - The malty notes that I find consistent with DFH. Flowery, lemon hops. Really nice blend of hops and malt in the nose combine to create a sort of lemon curd type smell.  T - I admit, I used to be a DFH hater. But their blend of malts and hops is really winning me over. This is just such a great balanced taste of hops and malts here. Up front bitterness is apparent and quick, straight into a lemon rind, floraly hops hit, and then a malty finish. Could really drink this one all night.  M - Maybe a tad high on the carbonation, but cant really complain. Mouthfeel is never much of a big spot for me with IPAs, this one stays well north of good, but I cant rave about it.  O - a really sessionable IPA. Doesnt try and do to much in any one area and hits absolutely all the bases. Great interplay between malt and hops. I've had a couple other DFH and I was starting to convert to a fan, but this one made me a believer.

A gentle fade leaves a frothy covering that stays throughout. Smell is full of grapefruit and citrus with a healthy amount of sweet pine and caramel malt. A light dough and yeast. A touch of tropical fruit gives a nice flourish. Taste is superb it follows the nose and gives a big hop entrance. Hop oil and grapefruit skin. A lovely astringent quality that keeps it very dry even as the healthy malt core shows up to balance and give counter to the hop parade. Just enough toasted grains and doughy breadiness to put meat on the bone. The tropical notes are just a touch bigger making the beer juicy and deliciously flavorful. The finish is smooth and malty at first with the hop oil blossoming on the back end, coating my throat and mouth in that sequence. Feel is supple and crisp with a lively carbonation that is spot on.

Not very aromatic,  T - Get hit with a bitter dose of hops throughout that are really piney and earthy, some woody flavors, nice toffee throughout which helps balance it out. Left with the earthy flavors in the back end of this one.  M - It has a nice medium feel which is real soft and billowy. Nice amount of carbonation.  O - Nice east coast styled IPA in my opinion.

The earthy and piney hops come through for the most part. I don't get much citrus.  Taste/feel: You have to be kidding. This is fantastic. The balance is just what makes this such a ridiculously great beer. You certainly get a lot of the hops in the aroma and upfront with the taste, but the finish brings the malts. The feel of this beer is also superb. Creamy, refreshing, nearly perfect.  This is my first Dogfish Head, and I enjoy it a lot.

Some hop spice. Hops seem to take a bit of a back seat here so I'm interested to see how it balances out in the taste. Almost smells more like an ESB.  Taste: Wow those hops don't mess around. Piney hops engulf the palate with a crisp bitterness and smooth spicy flavor. Even through all that, the roasted malt quality holds its own and gives a nice toasted flavor to the beer. As the hop bitterness lingers on the roof of your mouth, flavors of biscuit and coffee play out on your tongue. The great balance of hops and malt in this IPA make it nicely robust.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with good effervescence and a smooth texture for the style. Above average drinkability. This is sessionable.  Final Thoughts: DFH's slogan is ""Off-centered ales for off-centered people."" While I understand what they mean, it's worth noting that there is nothing ""off-centered"" about this beer. It is supremely balanced. I usually tend to enjoy West Coast IPAs more, but the piney/roasty qualities in this East Coast IPA make it memorable.

D - Not hard to drink, but it's a little too sweet and not hoppy enough to want multiples of this. Decent drinkability.  Notes: I've never been a huge fan of these IPAs (a little too sweet and malty although I don't mind 120 for it being so different). Not too hoppy and has that caramel sweetness.

It sticks to the glass the way an IPA should. The nose is very hop forward yet balanced enough. There are citrusy and piney aromatics as well as enough caramel malt sweetness to not overpower you with hops. The flavors follow the same flavor profiles. There is plenty of malt to provide a sweetness that pairs well with the citrus and pine. It isn't overly dry either. It drinks lighter in body and in my opinion, is very sessionable. I've had this beer a million times but I can't turn it down. This is an all time favorite.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Maxwell,3.88,"The beer pours a beautiful clear apple juice and piss color. It sits in the glass as golden with a little bit of orange and red tints. There is a light but steady stream of carbonation from the bottom and a gorgeous eggshell white head forms with big soapy bubbles that mellow into a half a finger’s width. The beer smells light and citrus/apple sweet with a nice faint tingle of grapefruit in the back of the smell and a solid pale malt backbone strongly running throughout the smell that gives it a biscuit-feel. The beer tastes wonderfully balanced with citrus bitters and bready malts. The taste is a little sweet and leaves a very sweet bitter-syrup feel in the mouth. The mouthfeel is quite velvety with the carbonation and a nice thinly oozing gel to the beer. It leaves the mouth very clean with a slight sheen of saliva and a dry feeling towards the back of the throat. Overall I may be a little bias to this beer. This was my introduction to a great IPA and will always have a special place in my heart. It is a very solid example of the style, and a wonderful introduction to hops and bitterness for anyone that is new to the craft beer world.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Fusion_Pirate,3.92,"A: Poured into a Weisen glass after sitting out for about a minute, the beer yielded about a 1/4 finger of head, minor lacing and a light caramel, almost golden (dare I say 'lager') color. Slightly better than average appearance for an IPA.  S: Light, refreshing, caramel maltiness- some floral hints, a bit of the hops, but relatively tame compared to the hoppy olfactory overkill of DFH's blended Burton Baton. I would say 3.75, but I'll round up to 4 on this one.  T: Malty, moderately hoppy rush to the brain with a pleasant caramel aftertaste. At 6% ABV, it's slightly stronger than a session beer, but still pleasantly light-tasting (you could drink a couple of these in a row and still walk in a straight line).  M: Light, crisp and dry on the tongue with mild/moderate carbonation. No complaints here, but nothing to rave about- wouldn't mind a tad more carbonation, honestly.  O: I am admittedly a big fan of Dogfish Head beers in general and have enjoyed their 60 Minute (and 90 Minute) IPAs a number of times in the past. A couple weeks ago, I tried and reviewed their hybrid DIPA, 'Burton Baton' and my life was permanently, irrevocably changed. While it's not exactly fair to compare a 6% IPA like 60 Minute with a 10%, 70 IBU DIPA like Burton Baton, it's inevitable that my phenomenal recent experience with that beer will color my opinion of this one just a bit...thus my overall rating of 'only' 4.0. But in the world of 5 - 8% ABV India Pale Ales, 60 Minute IPA definitely stands on its own. :)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,georgeisabamf,3.45,"I'm trying my best not be to be biased as I tend to really not enjoy pale ales of any sort. But after reading online about how good the 90 and 60 minute IPAs were, I had to give it a whirl. Maybe it would lead me to loving pale ales.  It pours nicely. Nice head and a nice IPA smell with a very apparent hops aroma (obviously). Upon tasting it you notice that there is a lot of carbonation and it has quite a good mouth feel. The flavor is strong in hops, and if you really like IPAs you will love this. It's bitter, and does not favor to my taste buds however.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Oakenator,4.82,Still bubbles a while after this tap pour. Golden in color and clear. Bead perisists nicely. Smell is hoppy and somehow distinctively Dogfish. Taste has maple syrup on the back end along with the tangy hops. For a hop lover this is a great session IPAD - a tad strong for session but mild for this style. An excellent beer!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,SebD,3.91,"Appearance: It has a nice almost clear golden yellow color to it. It has a nice thick off-white head that dies down moderately slow and leaves some nice lacing.  Smell: The aromas definitly give out hints of pine, earth, some citrus, some breadiness and almost grainy.  Taste: Like the aromas, it has a citrusy/piney/earthy hop character to it along with some bready malts. Decent bitterness.  Mouthfeel: It has a medium/high carbonation with a nice overall balance and feel.  Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,tlazaroff,3.38,"*Note: This review was done while coming off of a cold, I can't vouch for my senses as I normally could.  Very biscuity on the nose with a tad of grain. Hops come across as a citrus/pine-like aroma, but a bit weak as the malt takes prominence.  60 Minute IPA looks great in the glass. It is a deep straw gold color with visible carbonation that supports a white head. The head lacing is moderate, at best, and the head itself falls back into the beer pretty quickly.  A bit like sweet biscuit on the flavor and pine with citrus notes coming in on the finish. There is a firm, but not overpowering bitterness overall.  Medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a touch dry on the finish. It's a great beer to just sit back and relax with after a hard day's work.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,SouljaSaia17,4.35,"A: The appearance of this beer is a golden-wheat color, not much of a head but has some nice bubbles on top. Moderate carbonation and leaves a little lacing.  S: I get a smell of citrus hops, pine, sweet malts, and a type of biscuit aroma and grapefruit notes.  T: A very nice sweetness to this beer at the beginning, immediately followed by a hop bitterness and citrus. This finish consists of honey and a dry yeast!  M: A well balanced IPA and is very drinkable. Lots of hop character with equal amounts of sweetness and bitterness.  O: For this being my first Dogfish Head, I came in with high expectations based on other reviews of this brewery. I can say that I wasnt disappointed. Not the best IPA I've ever had, but a very good version of the style. Cant wait to try some more from Dogfish Head, especially the 120 Min IPA which I will drink all 4 in succession!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,davecavemaster,3.97,"Dogfish Head is a craft brewery in Delaware that opened its doors in 1995. It started out as a restaurant/brewery, and then the brewery operation expanded into what it is today. What is it today? Well...This is a great brewery! There are a number of year round beers, as well as a bunch of ""occasional rarities."" To check out the their selections, go here. The brewery has a great website. But let's talk about the featured beer today -&gt; The 60 Minute IPA.dogfish head 60 minute ipa  There are lots of beers out there that are labeled as IPAs, but they don't all taste like an IPA should. The term IPA (India Pale Ale) came from English breweries that exported pale ales to India. By the early/mid 1800s, demand for the ""India Pale Ale"" style of beer became heavy in England as a domestic brew. The rest is history.  The Dogfish Head 60 minute brew pours with a semi-creamy, white head. It is a beautiful golden yellow, and has a spicy/fruity aroma to it. There is a definite sweet side to the initial taste, but then the hoppy bitterness kicks in. This is one great IPA. Very easy to drink, and very refreshing. I am drinking one now, as I write this, in the sweltering summer heat, and it is wonderful.  The ""60 minute"" part of the name comes from the fact that this brew is ""continuously hopped"" with Northwest Hops for an entire 60 minute boiling cycle. Dogfish Head also makes 90 & 120 minute IPAs as well. They are both heavier on the malt flavor, and the 120 minute is not available year round. I highly recommend this beer. Happy drinking!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,rundocrun,4.72,"Had to snag a sixer of this on my way back from vacation in GA. Iowa has yet to see the arrival of the Dogfish.  A - Body is honey-gold and crystal clear. Yields a finger of white billowy foam. Decent retention. Good lacing on the glass.  S - Pine, orange juice, citrus rind. Faint bread-like and crisp clean cereal notes underneath all the hops.  T - Lemony and sweet up front. More tropical fruits and some mild honey-like malt character through the middle. A fair amount of bitter hop-bite in the finish and aftertaste, but it's not uber-bitter just for the sake of trying to live up to the ""IPA"" label--respect. I'd have to agree with those who say this is one of the most well-balanced IPAs out there. Finish is juicy, citrusy and malty.  M - Thin-to-medium body. Carbonation is strong, but not overbearing. Finish is dry and incredibly clean. Hot-damn I wish this was distributed in Iowa!

As I take a real sniff of the beer, the citrus hops are in front with the malt behind. The hops are tasty without being overbearing. It's well carbonated and has a pleasant hoppy aftertaste.

Has some dank like characteristics. Roasted malt as the beer warms up.  T: Fairly balanced and tasty IPA here. Not a complete hop-slap, instead a more drinkable approach. A mix of fruity hop and flowery hop. Has a good malt backbone that evens it out.  M: Medium bodied with an average carbonation. Has a little of that good nectar mouthfeel.

S: Mostly grassy English-style hops with light citrus...mostly lemon. Grains and floral characteristics round it out nicely. A pleasing aroma that doesn’t bash you in the nose.  T: The aroma gave me some clues, but this still tasted different than I anticipated. The grassiness, floral and lemon notes from the aroma were well represented. Some toasted malt, but not as much overall malt backbone that I have come to expect from east coast IPAs. Not very bitter, but still flavorfull.  M: Body is light-to-medium, texture a little on the watery side. Lively carb and nice slightly chalky finish but nothing off-putting.  O: Really surprised me. A distant relative of 90 minute.

This is a beer for people who like the taste of BEER. I am one of those people. The finish is very crisp and refreshing, but also slightly dry.

10099,6108,rkentb,2.44,"Tasted this one along with several IPA's at once, including the 90 minute and Brooklyn Breweries IPA. This one came in a distant last place in my book.  Color was a straw with little to no head and hardly noticeable bubbles.  Aroma - Astringent aroma. I'm sure there's a kinder word for it but the aroma reminded me of cat pee. I'm sure it was just super hoppy, not bad or anything. But, of the beers I was sniffing, I liked this one least.  Taste - Bitter, bitter and more bitter. Dry. I'll admit, I think I'm more sensitive to bitter than some reviewers, so there is some bias there. But this one seemed unbalanced to me. Nothing but bitterness assaulting my taste buds. As I continued to drink I become desensitized to the bitterness and was able to enjoy it a bit, but why subject yourself to half a beer of lemon pucker face, when there are other, better balanced options available?

Refined and delicious bitter and sweet citrusy waves quench the palate with a marvelous balance of hops and (possibly) pale malt. Classic DFH character for the masses of the IPA curious and ""off centered"" brethren alike.

Yet it lacks something in the taste department. It's just a bit wattery tasting and a little too malty sweet for an IPA. When I drink an IPA I like just a touch of malt to balance out the hop bitterness, not a touch of hop bitterness to balance out the malt.

Some pine and malt undercarriage help carry this wonderously appealing brew.  The taste carries that piney/floral hop aroma an inch or so south to the tongue, bringing an unmistakable hoppiness to the beer, but not making it the bitter bomb that many IPAs have become. The malty undertone remains, though not as prevalent as on the nose, to provide balance. There's almost a honey sweet characteristic to the malt.  This is one of the best balanced, smoothest beers I've had. Very VERY well crafted by the folks at dogfish head and absolutely worthy of the reputation that has been garnered.

Appearance - the color is a paler orange. makes me think more of a pale ale than an IPA.  nose - the smell is subdued but wonderful. mainly grapefruit but with a subtle caramel malt background. a good bit of earthy & subtle coffee hints. clearly not your average hophead ipa. this one signals a much more balanced brew.  taste - subtle grapefruit upfront with a healthy dose of caramel, toffee malt swinging in strong. the bitterness is there in the finish to remind you that this is an ipa. taste is bright but balanced. while the hop profile of an IPA is there, the malt is on the stronger side. I feel like it's 40/60 hop to malt balance. Being used to the super hoppy american IPAs that are around, I almost feel this isn't hoppy enough. But as a beer on its own, it's got a wonderful, balanced flavor and it's sessionable to boot.  mouthfeel - smooth, gentle carbonation. i like carbonation, so I would prefer a little more in this area. overall this is still a smooth drinking beer.  If you're a hophead, I'd say go elsewhere. This is better for a more all around beer drinker. Unoffensive, smooth, yet got enough hop flavor to swing its own weight as an IPA.

A crazy dense two-finger head has pretty good retention and left behind some decent lacing.  Estery nose with piney and almost juniper berry like hops. A bit of yeast and caramel malt.  Classic East coast IPA, where you almost get the malt first and than the hops in the finish. Bready and a bit sweet upfront, with a nice kick of piney and grassy hops. Super balanced. Yum.  Smooth as silk and not quite as carbonated as it first appeared to be. Not too dry, not too sweet.  Overall this is a great example of the East coast style IPA. I love these for there balance and more old world hop profile. Well done DFH, now really wanting to try the 90 min. Wish we got this stuff here in MN, it would be more than welcome. Recommended to any fan of IPAs. Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,grannaniwa,3.73,"Appealing golden-orange color with perfect clarity. Very bright, citrusy (grapefruit) hop aromas with some sticky, pungent notes. Crisp, clear and direct. As it opens up, some earthy notes poke out from deep underneath.  Not that bitter at entry. Brighter tastes at the beginning, with some citrus. Very effervescent. Hops are balanced with a malty sweetness at mid-palate. The finish leaves a medium amount of herbal bitterness and tang on the tongue. Leaves kind of a watery impression overall.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Gatch,4.24,"Super tall boy can!! Better than I remember, which is saying something after drinking so many hop bombs over the years. This one has aged well in this crazy time for craft beer. Super tasty, plenty hoppy, and a great balance. Awesome!

10099,6108,Beer_Runner,3.8,"No enjoy by date. Slow pour into a standard pint glass.  A: One-and-a-half fingers of foamy, light beige head that quickly disapates to a thin layer. The brew is light copper and very clear with a steady stream of carbon bubbles raising.  S: The aroma is grassy, citrus, and floral hops. There are many diferent aromas blending together. There is also just a hint of sweetness in the aroma.  M: Very smooth and wet. The body is on the lighter side of medium. Very refreshing.  T: Many hops flavors blending together, but none truly standout. There is citrus, pine, grass, and not very much bitterness. The malt sweetness is very slight and just enough to offset any bitterness.  O: This is a good IPA not because it is a hops explosion, rather because it is a complimentary blend of many hops flavors without much bitterness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Agent1,3.9,"Appearance - Very transparent and effervescent. A bright orange with golds and yellows. Little bubbles float to the surface, however, not many. This IPA does not seem to be very carbonated. Not much head retention. Any bubbles remaining tend to cling to the edges of the glass.  Smell - Simple, yet a fairly rich aroma. Lots of fresh floral notes, along with mild citrus fruits and toffee.  Taste - Nice acidic bite to it due to the citrus flavors. Plenty of Cascade hops or perhaps Amarillo hops give this a refreshing dryness. These hop varietals really cut through during the initial taste. Grapefruit, lemon, lots of earthy notes like flowers and grass, vanilla, light malts and gentle brown sugars. A mild hint of coffee, too. Quite dry.  Mouthfeel - This IPA really coats the roof of the mouth, leaving your palate buzzing all over the tongue and back of the throat. It does leave a light coating after swallowing. More carbonation then I would have guess, judging by the initial appearance. Fairly balanced and a nice use of sugars.  Overall - This Dogfish Head classic is definitely more on the bitter side compared to that of its predecessor, the 90 Minute. It is considerably less malty and a little bit more on the dry side. Having tasted both the Squall and the 90 numerous times, this bottle definitely offers stark differences that allow it to go a long way in making this stand out to a hardcore Hop-Head. For more bite and less malt, I would highly recommend the 60 Minute over the 90 Minute IPA. Dogfish does it again!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,CMUbrew,4.3,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass Bottled on 2/13/12  A: Poured with a two finger creamy white head that was slow to fade and stuck around as a thin cap for the duration. Dark golden/amber color. Plenty of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Lacing was inconsistent, but looked great where it did stick.  S: I could smell this beer as soon as I got the cap off. Very fragrant piney and grassy smell with some earthiness and lemon zest in the background. Smells delicious.  T: Tastes delicious. Pine and grass hop flavor balance in a great way and go along with the biscuity malt and bitterness that lingers into the finish. I'm not getting as much lemon citrus as I picked up the first time I tried this beer.  M: Great mouthfeel. The medium body is elevated to what I can only describe as almost creamy by the excellent carbonation.  O: I have a feeling this is going to be a constant in my beer fridge. An absolute classic.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

A slight malt sweetness. Holy balls, this smells fantastic.  T: Ripe grapefruit blends well with the floral, perfumy hops. There's a slight cracker malt with a touch of honey too. Well balanced.  M: Feels light bodied, smooth, slightly slick with hop resin, very drinkable and sessionable.  Overall: This is well worth the hype.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Chickenhawk9932,4.3,"Pours a golden orange with a frothy white head, that leaves good lacing behind.  Smell is big citrus up front (sweet orange, bitter grapefruit/lemon) With roasted malt bread notes in the back ground. Finally a nice floral bouquet breaks through at the end.  Big citrus flavor hits the mouth up front while bitter grapefruit and sweet orange dance in harmony. There is a cool refreshing mouth feel of grapefruit flesh - very nice. Malty bread notes follow in a nice balance. Then it finishes with a dry nutty/herbal punch. An excellent beer with lots going on. When paired with spicy foods more sweet notes come out.

10099,6108,Firkin-Bunghole,4.42,"Reviewed from notes A: Yellow. With small white head that lingers on edge of glass S: Caramel malts, hops (grass and citrus) T: Hops are subdued thanks to the generous use of malts. The hops that I can taste are a nice mix of grass and citrus rinds & fruit. The bitterness doesn't linger after the finish. M: Medium mouthfeel, perfect amount of carbonation O: This is the beer I had the most of when I just started to enjoy craft beer. I probably have had more than a case throughout the past year, but never buy more than a six pack at a time since this beer is well-distributed here in NY. This is my go to beer for camping and when eating BBQ, burgers and hot dogs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,PorterLambic,4.3,"Arrives a dark amber/copper color with a nearly 1"" blanket of foam sitting quietly on top. Head dissipates fairly quickly and leaves some lace but once the head is gone, and it goes completely away, nothing coats the sides anymore. Smell is more balanced than many IPAs with malt actually noticeable, a piney/citrusy hops and a slight medicinal note. Taste is a good balance of hops and malt with a floral and pine note and that same medicinal presence. Smooth, lightly effervescent, full-bodied with a warming aspect that is nice and relaxed. Slight coating of the palate but not annoying. A really solid, quality IPA that isn't a hop monster. Apparently this brew is much better on tap. I know, what beer isn't? But other than Newcastle Brown I cannot think of one with so much difference between bottle and tap. On tap, another hit from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Titans77,4.22,"A- Golden bronze or a hazy copper color with a finger of a bright white frothy head with a good bit of carbonation. It looks delicious!  S- relatively heavy caramel malt smell seems to dominate. The citrus and pine from the hops seem to be the secondary dominant smell. I really enjoy the caramel aspect of this brew.  T- Really bold caramel malty taste is present with some bitter citrus and pine from the hops. What a surprise, right? Taste like a stronger version of the smell. This is good though because I thoroughly enjoy the smell which translates to enjoying the taste.  M- Medium bodied with a dry bitter finish. Pretty standard for an IPA. What stands out though is the light carbonation that caresses the mouth and tongue to really improve the drink-ability of this brew.  O- Currently my favorite session-able craft beer. Love the caramel malts in both taste and smell. Wish it had some more complexity in the taste, but still a solid brew from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,Lemke10,4.42,"I picked up a 6pk of this at a small discount liquor store when I was passing through Illinois since you can no longer get Dogfish Head in Wisconsin.  Pours a clear, light amber color with a bubbly cream colored head. The scent of hops is strong with this beer, just as expected. The taste is smooth, refreshing, and deliciously hoppy. Other than the hops, there is a great blend of citrus and oaky flavors. Has nice bready after taste that leaves a good wet feeling opposed to a dry finish. Overall very good and highly drinkable, a shame they ever left WI.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,dbrauneis,4.08,"A: Pours a golden yellow in color with some light to moderate visible carbonation. The beer has a two finger tall foamy off-white head that has some good lasting power, eventually reducing to a half finger tall layer covering the entire surface. Enormous amounts of lacing are observed.  S: There is a definite aroma of caramel malt sweetness as well as a more floral hop, then just a hint of citrus hops.  T: The flavor starts with a caramel malt body, some sweetness but not a lot. Then the flavor moves into the hop elements - both floral and citrus are present in about equal quantity. I would say this has moderate bitterness and it does not really linger after you drink it.  M: On the heavier side of medium bodied with high amounts of carbonation. Crisp.

As it sits the citrus hops come out a little but also muted  T- Very floral on the palate. Usually I don't like this but the malt backbone helps and adds balance, Goes very well with spicy brats  M- Nice light mouthfeel for an IPA, good carbonation but by no means a fizz bomb  O- Enjoyed this but don't think I'd choose it over Two hearted or Torpedo",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

There is a low amount of carbonation and there is some great lacing. The head lasted for over 5 minutes before it was gone.  Smell - Malts, caramel, hops, grass, grapefruit  Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste caramel, hops, and some herbal grassy notes. There is also some fruit flavours - grapefruit and a bit of a mango or apricot sweetness. It ends with a sugary sweet fairly bitter hoppy aftertaste.  Overall - I was happy to get to try this one on tap, and for free no less. The flavours were fantastic and the beer is delicious.

It's bold, complex flavor can hold its own to any IPA, including its older brothers 90 and 120 Minutes. My review is based off my on-tap experience.  Color: Glowing orange with hearty carbonation. Sudsy one-finger head. Rings of lacy foam grip the glass.  Smell: Honey; brown sugar; hops; juniper; mulch; earth.  Taste: A strong, bitter profile up front leads in for more subtle flavors underneath: toasted malts; pine cones; and wooden barrels.  Mouthfeel: Robust medium body that goes down with an acidity aftertaste.  Sampled from a standard pint glass.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,drumdude73,4.72,"I just LOVE Dogfish Head beer. This is truly heaven in a bottle. This is not one of those over-the-top IPA's where all you get is bitterness where a brewery creates the high IBU count at the cost of other characteristics. This is a very nice balanced IPA. Pours a nice golden color with LOTS of head and lacing. If you like Bell's Two Hearted you are going to absolutely love this one.

Citrus and pine notes. Not quite as strong and prominent as some other IPA's, but very complex.  T- Your standard, well brewed IPA. Nothing fancy. Hop profile right up front with a little underlying maltiness. Not overpowering in its bitterness. Finishes with some leftover hop bitterness on the palate.  M- Not too heavy, not too light, and perfectly carbonated. Goes down creamy and easily.  Overall, this is a beer that reminds me of SN Pale Ale.

My usual stop for all the staple beers we seem to love.  Look: This beer had a cloudy orange color with some tinges of gold along the edges. Head was a finger of white foam but was short-lived. It did leave some lacing behind.  Smell: Bready citrus notes and some pine basically made up the nose.  Taste: The palate was of a crisp lemon peal upfront. Then a clean maltiness was mixed with some faint tropical fruits. The finish was rather clean – given the beginning of the palate. Aftertaste was a nice bitterness that had some citrus hanging on.  This is a nice IPA. Honestly I would have to say it’s slowly becoming mote like a Pale Ale to me as my palate continues to develop. This beer will definitely be in standard rotation at my house.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

S: The aroma in this beer is highly citrusy and very grassy and floral.  T: The taste is very light and citrusy and not overly bitter at all. It has much more flavor than just bitterness and the flavors run the gambit from grass, herbs, smarties (yeah, the candy,) and a nice light bouquet of spring flowers.  M: The MF is nice and light and very refreshing. Perfect amount of carbonation on this brew for what it is and feels very slick and smooth in the mouth.  O: This is a quintessential American IPA and one that really got me into better beers several years ago. The beer is not extremely flavorful or bold but nails the style quite well.

There is a mild acidic tartness contributing to the citrus. There is an underlying biscuit from the malt that helps provide balance to all the hops.

Beautiful lacing remains as the beer is consumed.  S- Initial aroma is intense apricot. Tangerine, peach and flowers are all present as the head subsides.  T- Similar to the nose: apricot dominates with some lemon/grapefruit bitterness to dry out the palate. The balance between the hop and malt is displayed very well. Besides the modest 6% ABV, I can clearly see how well this can be sessioned with its flavor and balance.  M- Slightly syrupy due to its modest (60IBU) bitterness. Moderate carbonation supports the malt backbone and pleasant bitterness which I find to be the delightful attribute to this (flagship) brew.  O- Although I feel Indian Brown Ale is the unsung flagship brew from Dogfish Head, 60 Minute IPA is awesome and can clearly see its strong following.

10099,6108,heysuz,3.2,"Brew: Dogfish Head, 60 Minute  Intro: Growler, tap. Served in a tulip glass.  Appearance: Amber color and clear, above average carbonation but minimal head.  Smell: Hoppy smell very similar to 90 minute, some citrus notes like pineapple.  Taste: crisp and slightly dry with a hops flavor, well balanced, but not a lot of flavor.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and clean, not oily or overly dry, don’t feel the carbonation.  Overall: The flavor overall is weak compared to other Dogfish Head and IPA.

A pretty solid IPA, just not as interesting as a lot of others out there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Nice indicative biscuity malt balance for an East Coast IPA. Friendly smelling.  Spry grassy hops with a touch of citrus zest, lemon candy, pine, cedar, and mute spiciness. A little breath of alcohol in the back is nice. Thick sliced bready malts with a touch of caramel malt sweetness. Bittering levels are medium or slightly below for the style. No off-flavors can be detected.  An easy drink. Not quite as hoppy as I'd like, but the combo of a smooth feel and reliable medium carb levels make this a great session beer.  Great East Coast representation. Not as good as Two Hearted, but perhaps better than Founders Centennial. A craft staple.

S: Very clean smelling. Citrus, grassy, and herbal hop aromas over a very toasty malt backbone. The hop aroma is more restrained and subtle than most ipa's. It almost reminds me of noble hop, but fruitier. T: Sweet hop oils start out and give way pretty quickly to those toasty malt. The toastiness is really apparent. It reminds me a little bit of an ESB. The malt finally gives way to a lightly bitter and drying finish. Herbal hop notes linger in the finish along with some a slight sweetness from the malt. M: The mouthfeel is really impressive. This beer works out the front of the palette more so than most IPAs while the bitterness still lingers in the back. It's amazingly full bodied for being so crisp. This doesn't surprise me coming from Dogfish. They always seem to nail mouthfeel. O: I enjoyed this beer. It is really refreshing and there is apsolutely nothing unpleasant about it. I would, however, like the taste to be a little more centered around the hops.

I'm not going to pretend to be able to disseminate exactly which hops lead to which bitterness profile. Citrus is in there, but there is an underlying roastness/gameness that I can't quite put my fingers on. Finish is fairly dry with herbaceous and evergreen tinges. Finishes clean with a nice lemony zest. It's lovely. The malt and the hops intermingle so well in this. I give the malt a slight...and I mean slight, edge in the flavor.  M: The awesome maltiness is prevalent in the mouthfeel. Smooth body. Almost slick on the palate.  O: Balance. The idea of continual hopping is to preserve the hop flavor while preventing the hop astringency. Sam does a swell job with this one.

The aroma had a moderate dose of grass and pine hops, a light grain malt and a moldy yeast and had decent notes of caramel and citrus (grapefruit and orange).  The taste was light, sweet and hoppy with a notes of caramel and orange at first and finished a bit bitterer with a nice touch of citrus at the end. The flavor lasted only a short time with the taste fading rather quickly after the swallow.  Mouthfeel was just a bit past light in body with a dry yet watery texture and a semi lively carbonation.

Poured from 12oz bottle to pint glass.  A - The beer pours a dark golden/yellow/amber color. Perfectly clear with a small 1 finger white head with some retention and lacing.  S - I sense much more malt aroma than I anticipated. It is not dominated by hops at all, there are some citrus hop characteristics but mostly toasted crystal malt aromas.  T - The beer tastes just like the nose. Very malt forward with lots of toasted malt character. The hops are something of an afterthought. Not what I anticipated at all. The beer finishes with a mild bitterness and strong malt character.  M - Lighter end of medium bodied with decent carbonation.  D - Pretty drinkable.  Overall, after the comments on the forum I was greatly disappointed in this beer. In no way does it resemble Two Hearted (which I find vastly superior for an IPA). It isn't bad but much too malty for my taste and not enough hop character.

Finishes with a touch too much pine for my taste, and a bit more bitterness.  M: Light carbonation, has some body and creaminess but very little.  O: Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't call it exceptional. Maybe I got a bad batch. I'd give this another shot if given the opportunity, but it's unlikely that I'll buy it again at $11 for a six pack when there are beers I like much better that are also cheaper.  Based on the reviews here, I was expecting this to be a little better. To me, it's just your average craft IPA, although I thought the nutty start was a nice touch. I'm not a huge fan of piney beers though (I tend to prefer black lagers with smokey nutty flavors), not sure why I hoped this would be different.

Head leaves plenty of sticky lace along the sides.  S: Dominating scent is that of pine, but hints of floral and citrus complexity under that, especially as the head settles. Would like a tad bit more balance upon pour as I'm not a huge fan of pine, but is nice.  T: Mild bitterness and a touch of pine up front, fades into some slightly sweet malt and citrus as it goes down, then a bitter pine finish. Could use a little more flavor up front and a little less pine in the aftertaste, but very nice overall.  M: Good carbonation and a light, drinkable feel in-mouth, but leaves some creamy stickiness behind which is a bit odd for a pale ale (though I kind of like it and didn't knock the beer for it).

Just citrus, perhaps lemon? The flavor is ""bitter."" Instead the drink is dominated by a thick almost cake batter, caramel, and toffee malt wallop.

Taste: Full of hop flavor and bitterness, right away it hits you and it doesn't go away. After a second though, a nice light sweetness and slight saltiness come in to balance the bitterness out. The breadiness fills out the body and really compliments the sweet/salty character. Some malt presence is detectable as well, a subtle barley flavor can be found throughout the sip. The malt is a cleanup crew in this beer though, the hops are what you drink it for.  Mouthfeel: For such a clear beer, the body is very full and surprisingly bready. The carbonation is very crisp and really opens up the beer a lot and leads the way for those big hop bombs.  Overall: This is a great IPA, it has a very unique character.

Second smell catches some of the sweet malt. I'm surprised at how subdued the smell is.  Taste: mellow,slightly biscuity malt comes first. Next comes the hops with prominent one dimensional bitterness, this is right on the edge of my limit, quite bitter.  Mouthfeel: a bit clingy, almost spicy hops prickle the mouth.  Overall: This one surprised me, perhaps because I have been tasting a lot of DIPAs lately but this beer seemed rather subdued for the style. A light and bitter IPA with a surprisingly prominent malt (super hopped amber ale?). A well balanced IPA that doesn't really stand out in the extreme playground that is IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,MsRif,4.23,"Have had on-tap and in bottles many times. Pours a lovely orange/amber color with a thin white head that recedes quickly. No lacing to speak of. Aroma of sweet and citrus-y fruits, earthy hops, grass and pine. Taste of citrus, earthy/floral/piney hops and grass. I love the hop profile of this beer, and I generally am not an IPA fan. It's just so well-balanced that this is a truly enjoyable and drinkable brew.  Mouthfeel is medium in body with moderate carbonation.

A little more citrus then pine followed by a sweeter aroma.  Taste - A nice spiciness, with a bit of peppery taste at first. It fades a bit then gives way to a bit of citrus.  Mouthfeel - a bit more robust then I would originally expect with a nice level of carbonation and a good level of body for a 6% abv.  Overall - A good enjoyable beer.

Floral and citrus hops at the forefront but has a noticeable biscuity malt back. Not terribly complex, but it does smell good.  T-Nice citrus hop bite the tongue first. Ample bready/biscuity malt comes in and balances things out quite nicely. The bitterness from the hops and the slight sweetness from the malt really work well together. As with the nose, not terribly complex but well constructed and enjoyable.  M-Medium body and carbonation, slightly oily and slick, yet with a somewhat dry finish.  O-This is a well done IPA. Not world class, but very good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

A thin white head forms on the pour and subsides to a nice thick collar that leaves thick sheets of lace behind.  S: Sweet fruits, mainly apples and strawberries with a nice malt backbone. Some subtle citrus peel notes as well.  T: Very bright and sweet fruits up front that well integrated into a prominent, but not overpowering, oaty malt body. The finish is on the sweeter side, like candied sugars or honey.  M: Medium to light bodied with nice carbonation. The finish is coating sweetness with an ever so subtle bitterness on the backend.  O: A very good beer and a very solid go to choice. I could drink this all the time and in high numbers which is why I gave it a 4.5 overall.

Aroma is somewhat hoppy, slightly earthy/grassy, with lots of malts. Actually, the toasty-biscuity malt character is more prominent than the hops.  Tastes rather dull for an IPA, slightly sweet and slightly bitter. Nothing to notice here. Very generic, and closer to APAs more than AIPAs. Medium body and good carbonation. Lingering sweetness is certainly not welcome. Thoroughly ordinary for an ""IPA""  I am sure back in 2003 it pushed the envelope on the East Coast, but right now it only comes off as a balanced American IPA, not meant in a good way.  4, 2, 3.5, 4, 3",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Appearance- Very clear, light copper, 1/2 finger head, lace sticks to the glass all the way down.  Smell- Not what I expected... I remember this being a hop bomb, but it is really a well balanced smell. Lots of fruity smell from the yeast, nuttiness, and pine from the malt and hops.  Taste- Same as the smell, a good pine flavor, fruitiness from the yeast, and nutty malt flavor. Not nearly as bitter as I remember.  Mouthfeel- Nice and dry, goes down easy. Possibly my favorite part of this beer and the mouthfeel makes it highly drinkable.  Overall a very good beer. I wish we could get it in Alabama.

10099,6108,AlexanderSelby,3.84,"A very crisp and clear filtration on this brew, giving it a nice sunset orange flair. Head is solid. Smells of citrus rind and a little tree bark. There is a certain toasty-ness that comes through here, and also in the taste. This ""toasty-ness"" is the predominate flavor of this beer, in my opinion. It may be attributed to hops, or malts, but regardless of how it happens, it is there. I love it. Little slight sweetness upfront, then a swift pop of bitterness, and then that toasty finish.  I had this very popular IPA long ago and forgot about it, then revisited it the other day and I am glad I did. It reminds me that there is hope in the beer world. Beers that are popular with the masses are for a reason, and not just because of all the hype. This is unique balance of toasty maltiness blend with a fine wave of bitterness to make it something special.

Taste - Slightly sweet malt backbone with nice biscuit flavors, then a nice onrush of lemony hops. The hops are definitely not as pronounced as I expected them to be, leaving this beer a bit sweet. The finish is a little weak and the mouthfeel is a bit thin. Overall - Not a bad IPA, but I won't buy this again. I realize it's no IIPA, but it's a little bland for the price.

Starts with some citric hops (orange rind based, reminds me of Lagunitas), biscuity malts, and a touch of that almost, but not quite honey sweetness.

10099,6108,jondeelee,4.42,"60 Minute IPA opens with a hop-lover's dream aroma: heady, citrusy, bright hops notes overflowing with a balanced, nuanced, powerful blend of grapefruit, grapefruit rind, lemon, pine, and eucalyptus, as well as a sugary-sweet rosewater aroma that usually connotes excellent craftsmanship. And all this lies atop a malty, yeasty, sugary bed of malts that evidences equal care, the malts adding huge brown sugars, baking wheat bread, apricot, and orange notes.  On the tongue, the beer is immediately hoppy and bitter, the grapefruit and pine note especially present, but strongly backed by lemon, eucalyptus, and anise. The bitterness is not overpowering, but certainly bites at the tongue and soft palate, and continues to do so long after the beer is swallowed. Beneath these hops lies a good bed of malts, and it says much of the craft that went into this beer that the malts are even noticeable, so strong are the hop flavors. Still, the malts add good levels of brown sugar and toast, as well as touches of orange. The aftertaste is mainly hops, with hints of toast, and lingers for a while (though not as long as the hop bite). Mouthfeel is medium, and carbonation is medium to medium-high, adding to the burning sensation.  Overall, this is an excellent IPA, and while it's big brother--Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA--has been called ""perhaps the best IPA in America,"" 60 Minute IPA offers many of the same flavors at a lower cost per bottle, and is likely far more accessible to someone unfamiliar with strong IPAs.

The hop character is very present, but it is not over the top (gotta go with the 90 minute for that). The balance is proper. There is a best bang for your buck on this beer.

Gorgeous golden-tan color, which when held up to the light almost looks like a pilsner.  Smell is exceptional - plenty of hops, hops, hops, with a pleasant grapefuit and citrus along with it. This must have been the reason 18th century peasant kids were so excited to get fruit for Christmas, right? I also get some light apple and maybe some orange in there to. It also kind of smells like my grandfather's old work shed/tool room with the pine-y, woody smell. This is ""dude aromatherapy.""  This is one of the most balanced IPAs I've ever had - it's a great mix between bitter and malty, exceptionally smooth and refreshing, with subtle (not overpowering) grapefruit and citrus tastes. Aftertaste is so pleasant. Nothing to nit-pick about this beer at all. Also, while I'm currently reviewing this beer from a bottle, getting this on tap (if it's fresh) only makes it better. It is (and I don't use this term lightly) a great session beer.  Dogfish, as noted by about 2,000 other beer reviewers, totally nailed this one. Nothing new to report here.

Poured into Victory shaker; yellow golden colour with nice head.  Nose is caramel smelling malt with some sweet milky grain. Very nice, but I don't get a whole lot of hops from it. Rye and pine in the background.  Taste shows far more hops with a malty, fruity-yeasty body. There's a decent amount of initial bitterness, and it plays well off the sweetness. The fruity yeast influences and bittering hop style remind me a bit of an English IPA. Much drier than I expected for a DFH beer.  Mouthfeel is full-bodied, creamy and good.  Very interesting taking on an IPA, and it's interesting to get further acquainted with the East Coast style.

Spots and sheets of lacing.  Smell: Bitter citrus (grapefruit) and pine. There is also some more earthy/grainy aromas which I don't like so much. Bit of caramel malt.  Taste: As above, but I'm obsessed with the graininess. Would otherwise be nice with big bitter citrus and spicy hops as well as a nicely balanced malt backbone. Can't get past the grainy flavor.  Mouthfeel: NOt bad at all. Dead on with the carbonation. Sticky, resiny hops feel.  Overall: I've probably had this at least a hundred times, usually on draft, and generally enjoyed it. Last few times I've bought it, I didnt care for it much because of the grainy smell/flavor I've noted above. I assumed it was old beer, but this six pack is fresh and its got the same problem.

I bought this for a family party to serve alongside my chilli and so far it is a big hit.  Theflavor has a slightly bready malt before the lemony citrus and floral hops come in. Very dry finish and a nice bitter bite to boot.  Feel is spot-on. The medium body has strong carbonation and just a bit of lingering oiliness.  The drinkability is insane. This is just a great beer.

10099,6108,elNopalero,4.15,"What a difference fresh makes! DFH 60 wasn’t my first IPA or the beer that taught me to love hops or anything like that, but it is the beer that taught me the importance of checking for a bottled-by date. And with good reason. From the tap—which I can only assume/hope makes it fresh—this comes out a wonderful golden-amber color that’s just hoppy, crisp and floral to the nose and palate. It’s a solidly delicious IPA—but get it fresh, fresh, fresh.

10099,6108,CyclingLush666,4.24,"This is a very tasty beer, but its appearance is nothing special in my opinion. It has a very nice white head, but is very light and its not once you get to the 90 and 120 minute IPA's where you see the darker color.  The smell is very citrus with a undertone of barley and hops. It smells like how it tastes, very sweet for an IPA. Not bitter at all, so if you don't like the bitterness, this could be the IPA for you.  The taste is a sweet one for an IPA, but good nonetheless. I would say its close to a blue moon for the citrus taste just obviously much better with the undertone of hops in it.  Mouthfeel is nice, a very light flavor for an IPA.  I think this is a very solid beer. It's not as heavy as some of the other dogfish head beers, so it should be no problem putting away the whole 6 pack if you wanted too. The only thing I don't like is the low alcohol content. The 90 min may only come in a 4 pack, but that's all you need at 9 % for each. I think the 60 min is a good beer, and is very nice especially if your trying to drink something lighter.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,Jugs_McGhee,3.15,"12 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a generic hefeweissbier glass in Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live.  A: Pours a two finger head of slight cream, fair thickness, and good retention. Colour is a semitransparent copper.  Sm: Bittering hops - probably cascade but I can't be certain. Some caramelized malt. That's it. A moderate strength aroma.  T: A balanced mix of bittering hops, malt, and clean barley. Again, I imagine they're cascade and/or amarillo but I can't be sure. It's rather simple in terms of flavour, and I wouldn't call it subtle either. Thankfully, though, it isn't too bitter as is the case in many imbalanced IPAs. I do like it. It's a pleasant flavour.  Mf: Wet, smooth, and a touch too thick. It avoids the common pitfall of being too coarse. The mouthfeel complements the flavour but doesn't seem tailored specifically to it.  Dr: Very drinkable; I don't usually find IPAs this drinkable. The ABV is slightly above average, but it's well hidden. I'd try it on draught, but it isn't interesting enough to warrant buying bottles of again.  C+  *** On-draught @ the Thirsty Lion in Denver, CO:  Floral hops and a creamsicle flavour are prominent alongside the pale malt backbone.  C / AVERAGE  *** 04/12/19:  Soap. Citrus. Pale malt.  High C / AVERAGE  *** 01/09/21 I don't know why I bought a sixer of this after not thinking much of it multiple times in the past, but here we are:  12 fl oz bottle. $8.99 USD/sixer at a Rouses grocery store in Metairie, Louisiana.  6% ABV. ""IPA."" 60 IBUs. Brewed with ""Northwest hops"" per their website (whatever that means...no specific varietals are identified).  Served cold into a stemless wine glass.  BODY: Semivibrant copper. Boasts impressive clarity...obviously filtered.  HEAD: Fluffy, frothy, white. Sticks around a good while (~6-8 minute head retention).  TASTE & TEXTURE: Coating and oily, with a nice floral hop profile...I'd bet on Cascade or other C-hops if forced to guess which varietals were utilized. Has a somewhat bready yeast flavour, actually, which I didn't expect. Hints of hop resin...Amarillo, maybe? Simcoe? I don't taste any grapefruit, pine, or oniony hop flavour.  Smooth, wet, medium-bodied, unrefreshing, well carbonated.  Its breadiness is a bit odd to me, but it works decently in tandem with what I assume is caramalt and 2-row/pale malt to comprise a decent (albeit overly noticeable) malt backbone.  OVERALL: A likable drinkable IPA, but its hop profile doesn't dazzle and one can do better even amongst widely distributed expressions of the style at this same price point (e.g. Sierra Nevada's Celebration or Torpedo, Lagunitas' IPA(s), Elysian's Space Dust, et al.). This'll scratch your IPA itch and it's affordable & easy to find, but it won't impress discerning drinkers looking for the best the style has to offer.

10099,6108,weizenbob,3.77,"12 ounce bottle purchased at Hamlin Grocery in Ludington, MI. Bottled on 8/4/11. According to the Dogfish Head website, 60 Minute IPA is brewed with more than 60 hop additions across an hour long boil. They also go on to call it a session IPA, though it contains 6% alcohol by volume. I popped the cap and poured into a tulip glass.  Tipping the bottle horizontally yields three fingers of head in the glass. The head is off-white. Retention is very good. Lacing glides down the glass as head disappears. The beer is lightly copper colored with just a touch of haze. Carbonation is not very active to the eye.  The aromatics are robust and lean heavily on hop aromas. There is a fine distribution and balance between citric, floral, and piney aromas. The citrus smells sweet and tangerine-like as opposed to grapefruit-like. There is a little breadiness in the aroma as well as a bit of alcohol. It is a pleasant mellow vibe.  The first sip reveals a beer that is maltier than the aroma would imply; that is not to undervalue the hop profile either. However, there is even a large contrast between the hop aromas and the hop flavors. Grapefruit bitterness hits the lips, coating the mouth in a resinous film that persists without overpowering. A little bit of pine manifests on the tongue. Biscuit malts rise above and mingle in some alcoholic sugary sweetness. For my tastes, the malt bill rests high in the balance and the blend of hop flavors is not my cup of tea. However, it appears to be deliberately crafted in that vein.  The body of this “session IPA” is on the lighter end of medium. Carbonation is moderate and appropriate. It feels surprisingly light, but the persistent grapefruit barb keeps it far from easy drinking. Though the continuous hopping does strike a fantastic balance between bittering hops and aromatic hops, I just didn’t care much for the taste. I don’t care if a beer is perfect in every other category; if I don’t like how it tastes, it’s not going to get far with me. I can’t imagine buying this one again.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) A lot of people are passionately for or against DFH. I feel that some of their beers are good and some are just misses. I don’t give a Schlitz for this particular brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,TheAlamoWrocker,4.46,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, bottled August 1st of 2011, into a Blue Star Brewery Pint Glass.  Appearance  A beautiful one fingered creamy head with carbonation rising up from the the bottom of the glass. Pours a beautiful Mikado and Selective Yellow. The head is nicely lasting on this glass and wow does it stay nicely. The head even follows nicely down this glass looking amazing. That head follows all the way down during this drink and never leaves.  Smell  Hops on the initial breath-in with malts making up the rest of the smell. Slight biscuity with a small pine coming through.  Taste  On the initial taste the first thing I could say is wow. This is a brew that just gave me goose-bumps. The hops are what I really taste and a strong bitter after bite comes in. There's even a nice citrus taste. As it becomes slightly warmer pine oddly takes over the hops taste.  Mouthfeel  That feels really creamy. You can feel that lasting head going in. It has a pretty strong medium body with some mild carbonation as well.  Overall  This IPA was amazing. I think I would like this brew slightly warmed up to get more pine out of it. It's not too powerful that one will knock you out, but if I had a whole six-pack of this I would consider drinking them all in one sitting.

I didn't expect it to be as intense as the higher numbered IPA's and sure enough, that was the case here. No hop bombs or intense aftertastes here! Instead, this beer was beautifully balanced and not too strong in the alcohol department; making it an IPA that served as a textbook example of the style!  Nice pour to this, with a bright apricot hue and a great head. The lacing didn't match but that was more than made up by the mouthfeel of this beer. Nicely balanced and with a consistency that was quite oily and resiny. The hops were present, but not overpowering, and the grapefruit, pine, and earthy notes blended together nicely. The back had a subtle hop burn without requiring a glass of water to wash it down. The suds-like appearance of the head was enough to show that the carbonation was on the mark as well, as this beer was a bit lighter to the taste than just about any IPA that I've ever had.  I couldn't taste the alcohol in this and even though it's not a true session beer, this would be easy to enjoy multiple time in one sitting. This isn't like its West Coast counterparts but if I had never tried an IPA before, this would be the one I'd ideally start with. It wasn't metallic, too dry, or enough to knock me into next week.

S - There isn't much of a hop aroma here for an IPA. What's there is a good citrusy smell, but it is a one dimensional. This beer could really benefit from dry hopping.  T - The taste luckily is greater than the smell and more complex. There is a moderate citrus, floral hopiness that is balanced out by a sweet pale malt. I am a person who likes sweeter beers and I think that this one has just a tad bit too much sweetness.  M - The mouthfeel is near exceptional in my mind. The carbonation is slightly tingly, yet goes down smooth. The sweetness from the malt prevents the palate from drying out and there is an oily feeling from the hops that remains too.

I wouldn't mind coming back to this one again and again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,haywire77,3.21,"Poured from a bottle dated 8/15/11 into my trusty SA perfect pint glass.  Poured a nice clear copper orange with yellow tints around the edges. 1"" of dense white frothy head capped the pour and stuck around for a good 5 minutes before receding to a solid covering. Solid lacing down the glass almost like a milkshake.  To me, the smell is off a little for an IPA of such acclaim. Kind of musty orange peels and sweet malts that fades to a light floral scent. Nothing overpowering and no heavy hop smell.  The taste is right on par with the nose. Sweet bready malt dominates this beer in my mouth. A little citrus and hops on the back side and a dry bitter finish. I think I can taste toasted poppy seeds???  Mouthfeel is tingly amid decent carbonation, and yet still creamy at the same time. Finishes nice and dry and after a few seconds, you almost forgot you were having an IPA.  Overall this is a pretty standard for the style, but nothing that I would purchase in large quantity. Very drinkable, but just not quite what I look for in a good IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,LAMAGS,4.18,"Another tasty IPA from Dogfish head, pours, an opaque amber color with a persistent white head. The nose is fairly typical of IPAs from this brewer with hints of citrus and spice. The taste is solid malty, hoppy, and sweet. The 60 minute does have a little bitterness to it that lends it some bite (unlike the 90 and 120 minute IPAs from Dogfish).

T: Big upfront citrus hops with a nice backbone of malts to balance it out.  M: It's a little ""dry"" to me. But I feel like I have the 90 and other bigger beers stuck on the brain at the moment...

Nice head without much lacing. Gold color. Hops and sugary malt aroma. Flavor is fairly hoppy and bitter, a little citric, pretty balanced with the malt bill. Decent carbonation, sharp and fairly dry finish. Doesn't linger too long. Pretty drinkable.  Again, it's not bad but it's also not worth really seeking out.

10099,6108,kkipple,3.78,"Not totally sure how this IPA has eluded a review for the 6+ years I've been on this site, but let's fix that now...  Single bottle for about $1.50 in NC. Bottled on date reads 8/1/2011 - so just over a month old. Three cheers for a legible born-on date!  A. Gunsmoke out of the bottle. A very nice, full and dense white cap sits atop a medium-gold brew. My New Belgium goblet works its magic and a steady stream of bubbles rise to the surface to support the head. No lace worth mentioning.  S. Similar to 90 Minute with that sugary, syrupy, somewhat simple malt sweet mainstay, with added ganja-green hops. Earthy and distinctive. Somewhat spicy, reminds me of Gubna. Onions...?  T. Drier than the nose suggests, thankfully. The hop bill is decidedly odd, spicy and green, with just a little grapefruit pith and not much pine at all. While the green-spiciness and earthy, dirty hops are somewhat distracting to this IPA drinker, the flavor rights itself shortly and finishes out just fine. All in all... good, but not great. This is no Stone IPA.  M / O. Medium-full body, good carbonation right from the bottle. A slightly sharp hop-fade finish. Cleansing and easy to drink.  60 Minute is respectable, and would have gotten a better review from me back in 2006... but times change, the bar is raised, and now it's simply a quirky, well-put together IPA that isn't exactly my cup of ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ChrisSimpson1968,4.05,"Orange-copper color with a large, fluffy off-white head and good lacing. Aroma is strong grassy, herbal and citrus hops. Bitter hop flavor is nice, but very drying. Definitely some pine in there too. This beer is more powerful than the 60 IBUs indicate. Not as refined as the 90 minute, by any means. Much more of an ""in your face"" style. I prefer something with a little more malt backbone, but if you’re really into hops this is a very good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T - Taste is WAY light for a continually hopped ipa.Getting a weak grassy/hay/bitter musty fruit kinda thing. Toned WAY down for a ipa of this class. I would really give this to a ipa newb. Whats up with this ipa's taste?  M - starts off fizzy small bubble style, and then gets worse and more fizz as it goes down your throat. LIGHT after taste & NO bite!  O - Overall... I really expect more outta this ipa, almost like a IPA light. I don't know, but is this really how east coast ipa is? I sure hope not. Please add more aroma and bittering hops. Does this style have only a single hop variation?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,output01x,4.32,"Poured from a 12 oz. capped bottle (Bottled On 06/10/11) into a pint glass.  A moderate pour yields a 1 1/2-finger off white head that dies down to a thin, clumpy dusting after a few short minutes. The body is a slightly hazy golden amber with a good amount of rising carbonation bubbles. Decent lacing attempts to cling to the glass sides but quickly slides down between sips.  A quick sniff gets a nose-full of citrus hops. A deeper inhalation discovers orange peel and grapefruit with just a touch of mango. Pine and grassy hops notes are there in the background, but do not comprise much of the nose. A good backbone of sweet, caramel malt helps to offset the hops aromas and offers a bit of balance.  Sweet malt and citrus malts with notes of orange peel and pineapple start each sip. As the beer is swallowed, the hops flavors quickly change to pine and grassy, with a good grassy bitterness coming in later as an aftertaste. The bitterness may not be satisfactory for a true hophead, but it is especially strong for the style.  Medium bodied with good carbonation, this beer has a good thickness for the style but remains drinkable the whole way through. The body is just right for an AIPA as it is not too watery (which would inhibit the flavors) and not too thick (coating and sticky are not refreshing). The carbonation is a little prickly but is not very noticeable.  This is, in my opinion, one of the best AIPAs out there. As such, it is a great benchmark by which to judge other beers in this category. The mouthfeel is practically perfect and the flavors and aroma are well-balanced, complex, and delicious. There really aren't too many beers, not to mention AIPAs, that are this well crafted.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Seems more like a west coast hops aroma with citrus hops, some pine, and a slight/light floral bouquet to this beer, I think there might be a little malt sweetness somewhere in the background.  Taste is more citrus hops, with accents of pine and slight floral hints, with more of the sweet malts creeping in, a very well done IPA.

10099,6108,magictacosinus,4.47,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle.  Appearance: A lightish amber color that is not as intense as 90 minute, but contains more notable carbonation as well as plenty of frothiness in the head.  Smell: Very bold citrus and floral notes, as well as dried hops. Contains a sweet ester that is enjoyable and fruity. Barely getting any malts here, but I expect a good IPA to smell like this.  Taste: Ridiculously great! There's a wonderful sweetness to the beer's flavor, and the hops balance it out very well to give it a bitter tone that reminds me of dried grapefruits and apricots. It contains the ""syrupy"" flavor that I absolutely love Dogfish Head for. The malts are so well balanced with the hops, that it's hard to believe that this is an IPA. Usually, IPAs can cause extreme bitterness on unwitting drinkers, but I can see ANYONE who loves dried fruity and sweetened beers loving this.  Mouthfeel: Though there is significant dryness, this is beer is very smooth. It isn't too bready, nor is it too hoppy - it's just right. The palate is wonderfully stimulated with various degrees of hoppiness, sourness, and syrupy sweetness. Delicious.  Overall: An amazing IPA. 90 minute IPA is still one of my all-time favorites, but this is the lesser overwhelming brother of that beer due to it's lower ABV and hoppiness - which makes it something that can be drunk more often rather than from time to time as a treat. Great stuff once again from Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T: flavor is very floral and at times fruity. a mild citrus interacts with pine and mango. a meaty malt takes notice in the middle. finish is slightly more focused to bready, rather than bitter, but overall is pretty dry.

10099,6108,iDrinknewglarus,4.17,"A: Very clear beer with a light golden-orange color. The head dies down and dissipates kind of quickly. It leaves mediocre lacing. TONS of carbonation streaming up the bottom of the glass.  S: Fruity, tropical smell mixed with pine. Orange is the dominant citrus aroma. Cracker malt smell. Ever so slightly bready as well. Nothing overpowering.  T: Juicy hops. Biscuit and dough malt backbone. Some real good hop flavor going on without the super crazy bitterness that a lot of IPAs tend to have nowadays. The hop resins linger around and coat your mouth a bit. Finishes slightly dry, but still quenches thirst well. Surprisingly complex in flavor, but still remains easy-drinking. Leaves your mouth watering, wanting more.  M: Medium-high carbonation for the style leads to a medium mouthfeel.  This is a commendable beer because it's been around for a while, tastes great, and I think it would please both the beer geek and the beer novice.

Floral and citrus hops dominate the aroma, but the flavor is at least somewhat balanced, with the complex combination of spicy, citrusy (orange), and must hop characteristics being complemented by a noticeable biscuity malt base. The light, active carbonation cuts through the bitterness and helps this one go down quite easily.

I like to spend as much time at the beach in Delaware as I can, and whenever I do, I stop by the brewpub to sample a variety of styles! However, there is just no beating their IPA's.  A - Pours an amber color with not much of a head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing.  S - Hops, hops, and more hops... with just a touch of carmel-malt scent. Also, citrus, vanilla, and maybe it's just me, but an ever-so-slight touch of coffee.  T - This ale satisfies my desire for dryness, a little malt flavor and bitter hopped injected goodness. Starts with a mildly sweet malt flavor and a touch of fruitiness, then rounds out with a lingering, bitter finish that sticks around on the tongue.  M _ slightly on the over carbonated side, but only slightly so. In fact, I prefer a little more Co2 that not enough. Thought the bitterness from the hops remains with you for a while, it creates a clean, crisp, flavor in your mouth  O - Overall this is an excellent example of an American IPA.

Not cotton candy fluffy, but more drier-lint-fluffy.  That was the easy part. The hard part is trying to describe the beer's smell and initial taste. Hoppy I guess, but they blend and marry so well with the obvious malt that unique beer emerges. It tastes like 60-minute like broccoli tastes like...broccoli. I treat 60-mute as its own entity. For example, ""Will I have an IPA this evening or a 60-Min?""  The mouthfeel stands out as excellent for a ""small"" beer. Just enough weight and linger. Never taxing or cloying.

S: Grapefruit, floral notes, a little dank herbal, slight fruity sweetness, and a somewhat unpleasant yeast ester in the background (alcohol also seems a little to noticeable for a 6% beer).  T: Tip of the tongue is a vague grapefruit and floral notes with a little shot of alcohol and that unpleasant ester quality. The fruity hop quality is no where near as strong as the nose suggested. I'm not sure I'd say it isn't as hoppy as the nose, just not as balanced/pleasant. Lots of one-note floral hops with too much alcohol bite right up front. The middle is basically the hop flavors devolving to the finish with a slight touch of sugar sweetness. The malt is almost completely vacant. Finish is dry and bitter with a little alcohol, dirty/old hops, and leaves that unpleasant ester lingering (almost aspirin like).  M: Light bodied, moderate carbonation, has a bit of a soapy mouthfeel. Not very crisp or what I'd consider smooth.  O: I don't get this one. It's a fairly fresh bottle that has been stored in a fridge. It's basically a poorly made IPA in my eyes. No malt character what so ever.

10099,6108,huhl23,4.65,"The IPA that got me into this whole craft beer money drainer. The color is a light amber orange, a little bit of head that goes down to nothing almost. Fair amount of lacing but nothing too extreme. The nose is outstanding. Floral and fruits notes. Little to no malt present. The taste is what gets me. Creamy mouthfeel. A little sweet with a rush of hops and malt. Almost perfect balance. My favorite single IPA that I can get in Georgia. Well done DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,PeteIPA,4.7,"Finally got my order filled for my keg and the wait was worth it. This is one of the best east coast american IPAs I've had.

10099,6108,bayougutter,3.8,"04-13-11 date Poured to a tulip  Nice pale orange-amber, clear with a one finger white head. Spotty to decent lacing.  Smell is a good combination of the hop scents, floral, grassy at first then a piney, resiny. I did't get any of the malt aroma.  Taste is bolder and more complex than the aroma, with the same overall hop complex as the smell. It has a nice medium malt background that suits this brew nicely. Good citrus bitterness on the finish.  The mouthfeel is good with a decent coating of the palate and carb bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass all the way thru the drink.  I had this on 06-02-11, six weeks old, which I prefer an ipa to be 3 to 4 weeks old. This one may have been a little past prime but still very enjoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,MacQ32,4.21,"A - Pours a beautiful copper into my Maudite globe glass, awesome 1.5 finger head with great retention and nice lacing!  S - Smells very malty/sweet, piney and grapefruit like hops - orange notes too maybe? Very earthy  T - Tastes very good, more citrus than floral, but both apparent. Touch of malty sweetness. Earthy, once again. Nice citrusy hop at the end mmmm  M - Heavier bodied for the style for sure, nice carbonation though  O - Overall this beer is very good, a bit heavier for an IPA at 6%",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,tdm168,3.97,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass  Pours a dark gold with carbonation bubbles rising to the top but with little head. Smells of hops and pine. Taste is primarily pine like pine cones and pine sap. In my opinion pine hops can be overbearing, but this is more mellow and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated, and dry.  Not my favorite IPA from DFH, but that's because I prefer their more intense DIPAs. Overall, this is a decent beer; one that I come back to time and time again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,sendsilk,4.03,"Ah yes, one of the quintessential IPA's out there. The DFH 60 Minute IPA is great, steady, reliable beer which sets the standards by which many other IPA's are judged. Not much of a point in reviewing this because if you don't know what it is let us know and Tomyy will hit you over the head with a tack hammer. He's really a big dumb animal isn't he?  Anyway, solid, and safe beer to order if you don't see an IPA that you like (or with a date on it for that matter).

A: Pours clear copper gold with yellow highlights, good carbonation rising, and a tight bubbled white head that laces the glass fairly well.  S: Interesting, these hops smell woody and herbal and earthy, and there seems to be a decen amount of sweeter malt here.  T: Very crisp and earthy/wood-like, just like the nose. I swear I'm picking up some oak in this. It's got good bitterness as well, that mixed with the caramel and maple/birch syrup flavor makes for a unique IPA.  MF: Light to medium bodied, crisp and a little clingy.  O: Not my favorite...but still something I could drink a few of.

10099,6108,Spikester,4.18,"Pours copper-gold with a two-finger head, good amount of lacing. Aroma is piney and floral. Taste is bitter citrus piney hops. The malts are present but barely enough. Ends with a long bitter medium dry finish. Overall a very fine American IPA. A bit pricey for us Western folk and somewhat hard to find. A rare but enjoyable beer for me. Note: Reviewed and enjoyed on 4/21/2008. Edit for fresh example: 10/31/2018. Bottled on: 09/04/18.

10099,6108,CHickman,4.5,"Pours clear amber copper in color with a foamy / cloudy 2 finger off white head that fades very slowly, going down like a cloud and leaving excellent foamy lacing and rings clinging to the sides; a handsome IPA indeed that looks excellent.  Smells of floral hops, light flowers, citrus hops, grapefruit, sweet malt, grains, light orange peel, brown sugar and some spices like coriander and pepper; a nice soft hoppy aroma that's well balanced by the malts and while citrus dominant, it's quite enjoyable to smell.  Tastes like it smells, with floral hops, flowers, citrus hops, grapefruit, lemon, grass, hay, pine cone, sweet malt, light toasted grains, light orange peel, light yeast or wheat, brown sugar, spices like coriander and pepper and some earthy tones; the taste has more malt than the smell and is very balanced, hiding the alcohol completely. It's like the hops hit first and then the malt and grains settle in and balance out the flavor.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a medium body, average carbonation and a slightly bitter finish that's on the dry side and leaves a toasty grainy sweetness coating the tongue.  A very enjoyable beer that goes down easy, and to me is a perfect session beer. A high recommendation for this classic IPA. Really easy to drink, moderate ABV, and excellent flavor, so grab a few.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,DavidST,3.8,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, bottled on date of 6/20/11. At only 3 weeks old this might be the freshest 60 minute IPA, I've ever tried, looking forward to it.  Pours a nice clear light golden color with a 2 finger head, okay retention and it leaves a decent lacing. The smell is a combination of hops and malts, the hops definitely don't overpower the malts. The feel is medium nice carbonation. The taste is good, a little bitter up front followed by a wave of malts and then an nice bitter after flavor. As it warms up a bit there is a definite alcohol flavor. Overall a good IPA, nice amount of hops and use of malts, I still prefer the over hopped stuff. (Oddly I prefer the Indian Brown Ale, if I'm drinking DFH which is even sweeter, so maybe I'm a hypocrite).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,tenaciousp65,4.45,a- the bottle pours a deep golden color. You can see the outline of your hand through the glass. A solid 1.5 in head. Very nice lacing s- you can really smell the hops from the start. Its not an overwhelming smell as many underlying tones come through. t- I'm shocked to learn that there is only one hop in here since it tastes like several. The hops dominate the flavor but are not overpowering. As the hops move aside the malt comes in to balance it nicely. As it finishes the hops dominate again. m- the mouthfeel is very smooth and slightly crisp. o-this is a beautiful example of an ipa. I can't wait to try the 90 and 120 minute.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,MrHassellYaHurd,3.94,"60 min pours a crystal-clear deep gold with a two-finger head of pure white foam. Steady streams of carbonation release from the bottom of the glass.  There is a delightfully hoppy scent with unmistakable tones of resinous grapefruit, as well as the more grassy and earthy varieties. There is a sweet malt backbone tying it all together.  The hops bitterness in this brew are on the lower end of the scale for IPAs, but (I feel) is just about perfect for a fairly light and refreshing IPA such as this. Semisweet citrus fruits, a fresh herbiness, and subtle biscuity malts are what I find.  60 min is medium-light bodied, refreshing, and delicious.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,3HovsepiansBrews,3.83,"A - A fairly clear amber with a thin white head.  S - The vegetable/earthy hop aroma is strong with a bit of pine. No real scent of fruits or flowers.  T - The first flavors are of slight hints of roasted coffee and then it transitions into a flavor similar to the chocolate orange candies. The end has a nice hop bitterness that finishes with a little bit of citrus sweetness and pine flavor to accompany the reserved hop bite.  M - Thin, crisp, and refreshing body.  O - The low ABV, light body, and the decent balance of sweet and bitter make this a good quality beer. It is fairly accessible to most people but will still please the enthusiasts out there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Initial taste matched the smell as the best IPA I've yet had. Great balance of hops without being super bitter despite the crazy amount of hops used during brewing, fermentation, and so on. Closest beer to perfect I've ever had! Well done DFH!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,jjboesen,4.48,"The perfect sessional beer and a perennial favorite of mine. With moderate alcohol (6%) and IBU (60), the 60-Minute IPA is so damn good to drink and so enjoyable. It opens with a quick head that disolves into a sticky film atop a beautiful amber body.  The nose detects a subtle miasma of mowed grass and apple (not an original impression, I know, but one to really describe it as honestly as possible.) The palate receives some grassy notes as well; however, there is a sweet lemon finish that plies the palate to endow a crisp mouthfeel.  Another worthy element of the 60-Minute is that it can act as the ultimate ""bridge beer,"" that elusive quaff that can bring a BMC swillhound over to the edenic land of fine craft beer.  A lovable beer that offers exceptional drinkability",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ArrogantBastage,4.32,"Poured into DFH Signature Glass  A: Deep golden amber with a thick head that lingers for the first few sips and dissipates to a thin ring lingering for the remainder. Trace amounts of lacing present.  S: Intense malt and hop aroma, an assault on the nose when using the signature glass. Very slight alcohol aroma detected in the background along with a little sweetness.  T: Lives up to the aroma with the rich malt starting to lead the way only to be knocked down by the hops which are herbal, spicy and citrusy. The bitterness is more rounded in this beer versus being as sharp as other IPAs can be. Some citrus in the finish which subsides to a nice lingering bitterness level tinged with some residual malt.  M: Medium bodied with a nice carbonation level. Not too thin or too heavy here. Carbonation is prickly and adds a bit to the overall bitterness.  D: One of my favorite offerings from DFH. Easy to have more than one. Highly recommended to those that have yet to try this brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Forb,4.17,12oz bottled May 2011...  Appearance: Translucent golden haze of a hue with decent lacing and retention.  Smell: A malt backbone is very prevalent here making it a unique IPA in this sense as the hop infusion is not overbearing in whole.  Taste: It comes across with the piney hop essence at first with a finish that is most notably malt in conclusion. Sort of a 80/20 hop start with an 20/80 finish in favor of the malt backbone. A truly unique take on an IPA for me.  Mouthfeel / Overall: A common medium to light body while also being on the low end of ABV in comparison to most IPA's of today makes this one a good introduction for the stout / porter drinkers who aren't so inclined to an IPA as well as a great frequent drink for those who are fans already.

Pours a clear yellow golden color with a very frothy two finger head that leaves a bit on the glass as it goes down. Citrusy hops on the nose along with a bit of fruit from the malt. Flavor follows suit with a nice dry finish and substantial bit of hop bitterness, but not over the top. I like the fact that this beer is only 6% and on the low end of most American IPA's these days. I think this is what is keeping it dry on the palate as well. Great example of an American IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Single finger of soapy off-white head falls to a sheet in a minute or so. Spotty lacing.  S: citrus hops are still here, a hint of mint on the finish. All this backed up by a sweet crystal maltiness. A little raisin in here as it warms as well.  T: A bit sweeter than I recall, but that's what I get for this old ass bottle. Bittering on the backbone, nothing much more than some citrus going on in the hop area.  M: Medium bodied with light to moderate carb. slick finish.  O: I've had this beer many times, but ever since the Brewmaster program, I can't seem to get any fresh. It's like my market is buying up old stuff.

While on vacation in Ocean City we had dinner at the Marina Deck and their DFH handle was the 60 min and it seemed like a perfect time to give it a try.  I had this beer on tap, served in a pint glass and it came to me with a nice hazy golden body with a white one inch head. The aroma was very pleasant with with citrus and floral notes with some hints of sweetness and caramel.  The taste was very good, I thought the citrus notes stood out the most with a little bitterness upfront, sweetness in the middle and rounds back out with a little more bitterness in the end. It has a great flavor all its own and it put to rest my fears that this was just a watered down version of the 90 minute. I really enjoyed the beer and ended up having two more throughout dinner.

Pours a deliciously wet and sticky dark golden orange with a finger and a half or so of egg-white head. Modest lacing as it dissipates to a lasting film over the top of the brew.  Grapefruit, lemon and orange citrus on the nose. Sweet malt accompanies the faint hop pine well. Not quite as grassy it usually is, but still a pleasant aroma.  Very sweet malt and floral citrus fruit. Slightest lingering bitterness, nothing overwhelming at all. Very well balanced IPA for those not looking for a hop-fest.

If they made car air fresheners of this smell, i would gladly buy a life time supply. But every time i got pulled over, i would probably be breathalyzer'd... which would be worth it for sure.

Body is a swings a bit on the thin side but it has good carbonation and drinks very smooth. Could dry a little better but the malty stick isn't very noticable.

Smell: Citrus hops aroma up front with hints of caramel and a sweet doughy maltiness. Also a bit of a grass and pine as well.  Taste: More pine than citrus so it is a bit opposite of the nose. It is very crisp though and you get a bit of the sweet malts in the finish. The hops are not nearly as heavy as some IPA's but not bad overall.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied and easy to drink. Overall not my favorite IPA but not bad.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,CFHMagnet,4.47,"A. A moderate pour gave me a finger and a half of lovely foamy head over a golden body. A slow but steady stream of bubbles rise from the bottom to the top. Head retains about 2-3 millimeters, looks good throughout the beer. Decent lacing.  S. Awesome. Strong pine and citrus flavors with some floral hoppage going on in this bad boy.  T. A nice bitter start that sweeps you into a sweet malt middle before whisking you back into the bitter land of hops again. Up front is citrus, and I don't even mind the grapefruit I taste in the mix. The hop bitter on the tail end is that of the pine forest, and it is a strong bold flavor.  M. Heavy carbonation in here, this beer is medium bodied. Definitely has a very drying finish, but that is one of the things I love about it.  O. A classic brew from Dogfish Head, this and Founder's Breakfast Stout really got me going in the craft beer world, so it will always have a special place in my heart. I like it's older brother 90 better, but 60 is an excellent beer and a good representation of the style. It's also one of the ones I recommend to those just beginning to shy away from macro brews in search of better beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,jhtipton,4,"Deep golden, poured a nice generous 1.5 inch head into my Ikea 12 oz tumbler. Smell is wonderful herbaceuos, piney, glorious hops. Head definitely lingers. The taste is a bit sweet for me, must be the malty aftertaste but nevertheless I would never push this beer out of my bed. A few more swigs and tastes reveals a dark seedy underside of bitterness in this beer. I not the fairly generous lacing. Definitely a medium bodied IPA, very rich frothy foam sticks around. Overall a very good example of an East Coast American IPA and explains why Dog Fish Head continues to be successful. Cheers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,AlCaponeJunior,4.05,"Orange to tan in color, clear, with a pretty good head that lasted a bit and sheets of lacing that slide down to rejoin the head.  Hoppy smelling, lots of citrus too, lemon peel and orange rinds, plus a good malt aroma.  Taste is downright delicious. Bold hops combine with lovely citrus and pine flavors, accenting a solid malt backbone.  Feel is pretty light, yet almost full bodied at the same time, easy to drink, yet still has a potent hop bitterness and creamy carbonation.  Overall it's a hit, as usual for most of DFH's offerings.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,PoorArtist,4.84,"A: clear yellow-orange amber, with modest tawny head, sticky lacing  S: delightful floral, citrus, jasmine, fresh rain. . . spectacular  T: as good as it smells: constantly refreshing floral hop bitterness with light toasted malt undertone bubbling up through pink grapefruit; lingering waves of light graininess.  M: fresh, astringent, beautifully drinkable, pleasantly grainy, warm afterglow  V (value): a somewhat expensive beer, but no penalty: it truly earns the premium  O: many other reviewers have said Dogfish 60 minute is a beer to keep in the fridge at all times, and I concur. I like it better than the 90-minute, actually, because of it's extraordinary drinkability and lower price; similar in character to Smuttynose ""Finest Kind,"" IPA, and that's good! I give a slight edge to Dogfish 60 though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Groomsy,4.1,"12 oz. bottle poured into Sam Adams Perfect Pint. ""Bottled on"" date of 02/15/11. Purchased as a single for $2.19 at Ozzy's in Waverly, OH.  Appearance: The body is a transparent light amber, maybe a dark golden hue as well. It's topped a foamy 2-finger head, which dwindles slowly to a complete cap of foam, which stays consistent. The beer is very effervescent, with tons of carbonation bubbles racing to the top of the glass. Very chunky lacing is left behind as the beer is consumed. Great looks in the glass, though the body was a little lighter than expected.  Smell: Very nice. Most notably, I notice a load floral hops, rich and juicy, followed by a little bit of citrus and pine in the background (think West Coast style IPA). There is a little bit of grainy sweetness for balance. This beer has a very thick, pungent, and earthy smell - just how I like my IPAs. Still very well balanced, and not overwhelming. Even though this is an East Coast IPA, I was expecting a little more citrus in the nose.  Taste: The tongue is hit by a bright bitterness out front, bringing some very floral flavors to mind - it's pretty bold and awakening to the tongue. Some subtle grain and malt sweetness creeps into the middle of the palate, but the hops really shine in the finish with a multitude of citrusy hop flavors (grapefruit, maybe some pineapple or mango) and a lingering pine finish. A rich and juicy IPA. Very well done.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation in this was a little more aggressive than I'm used to in IPAs, but it worked for the flavors. The beer is on the lighter side of medium bodied and leaves a sticky, resinous finish with lingering grassy and pine flavors.  Overall: Excellent IPA. Maybe not the best of the best, but this is most definitely a staple of the style and cannot be overlooked. Refreshing, chock full of good flavor, and most definitely a keeper in the fridge if you can get a hold of it and are a fan of the IPA style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ckollias,4.42,Enjoyed this 12 oz bottle out of a large snifter  A: Dark golden ale with a frothy white one-fingered head that dissipates into a wispy lace. Leaves a nice white trail down the whole glass.  S: Strong wonderful hoppy aroma. Slight floral aroma with slight mild of citrus.  T: A rich hoppy IPA. The hops taste crosses the palates and is present the whole time. Very hoppy and smooth from beginning to end.  M: Nice balance between the hops and the alcohol. Medium body and carbonation  O: Wonderful continually hopped IPA. This was my second time drinking this beer and I was much more impressed this time.

10099,6108,Shinypoptart,5,"Appearance - Very nice dark golden color, very effervesant (you can tell that it is bottle conditioned), the head sticks around throughout, it looks like a beer should look. 5/5  Smell - The smell of this beer is great, it reminds me of Dale's Pale Ale. You get a lot of nice floral hops and rich malt. 5/5  Taste - The taste follows the smell. It is an exceptional blend of floral and bitter hops with a perfect malty backbone. It is hoppy yet not overwhelming as the hops and malts work in perfect harmony. Rich and smooth, simply incredible. 5/5  Mouthfeel - Very smooth, perfect carbonation from being bottle conditioned. 5/5  Overall - This is what beer should taste like. It is full of flavor yet not overwhelming and smooth enough to drink a few of. Its my new favorite beer. Nearly perfect. 5/5  PS - I have read where a lot of people enjoy the 90 minute better than this beer yet I found this one much more tasty. The 90 minute is much thicker and malt forward, it comes off almost too sweet. The 60 minute is perfectly balanced and actually tastes like an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ChugginOil,4.05,"60 Minute pours a nice golden color with a couple fingers of white head. The nose offers some pungent hop aromas that are pretty fresh smelling.

10099,6108,Lauthaha,4,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a beer mug.  Appearance: Beer pours a beautiful, 100% clear rich golden color. Fizzy throughout, with a fluffy pearly-white head.  Smell: Very thick, and woody. Spicy (slightly citric) hop bitterness in the nose, with just a little malt underneath.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Nicely mixed...the bitterness and orange/yellow fruit flavor is balanced well with the mellow and smooth malt character, creating a sip that is both fizzy and oily, both tart and mellow. Good...but nothing that really jumps out and screams ""originality."" Aftertaste is grassy bitterness.  Overall: Perfectly ""good."" Not mind-blowing, but definitely worth the price tag.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,wahhmaster,4.43,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Samuel Adams Boston Lager glass.  Appearance: Pours a translucent, pale brown color. Has a large, frothy head that dissipates slowly and leaves some very nice lacing.  Smell: Has that strong, dry-hopped IPA smell. Has a grassy, earthy, West-Coast hops smell to it. Has a little bit of a grainy maltiness to it in the background as well.  Taste: Aggressively hoppy up front with a balanced finish. West Coast hops definitely dominate but there is a bit of grainy maltiness to balance it a little.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and nicely carbonated.  Overall: This is really the gold standard in my opinion for East Coast American IPAs. While the West Coast produces great hop bombs, DFH has made a very sessionable, drinkable IPA with great hops flavors. A classic and one of my favorites.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Also a malty sweetness  Floral hop hit up front, with light citrus coming in mid glass. Good malt backbone behind the hops. Dry finish with a touch of malt sweetness there too. For 6%, it packs a lot of flavor.  Feel is very thick for the style, without much creamy texture.  Overall, a very easy bitter drinker.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ChadQuest,3,"slightly hazy overall with a golden straw color and a white cap. All around this one has a really bready and biscuity nature to it compared to alot of IPAs. This one has both resinous and citrus hops characteristics in it and finishes on the dryer side, but the bready aspect stays fairly prominant throughout. Not very bitter as far as IPAs go these days, i have had a few Pale Ales that are just as bitter and hoppy. Kinda questioning the bottles age, but i have had this one many many times before and never fell in love with it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Astounding floral aromas percolate from this beer, intense citrus, grassy, earthy, pine notes present. Cascade seems to dominate the mix. Bitter and citrusy at the first sip. A very light caramel sweetness give a very balanced finish to the beer.

The pine really dominates the flavor, perhaps a bit too much so for my tastes. Finish is very dry.

S - Citrus, Grass, Pine, everything you would expect from a high quality IPA. Again, just a good smell.  T - Maybe it was just me, but I didn't get a lot of taste. I had a few beers before reviewing this, but there just wasn't a lot of taste there. Maybe it was served too cold on tap. Still a sense of Pine and some subdued bitterness in the finish. Some maltiness comes out as it warms up, but because the taste was so mild, it didn't last long in the glass.  M - Medium bodied with maybe a hint more carbonation than I would like. Again, I think this could be the problem with the Bar, not the beer.  O - I rated this both on the experience last night and prior tastings. I would have had to give it a lower rating based on last night, but having poured it into a glass from a fresh bottle in the past, I was able to rate it accordingly.

Smell: Hints of toasty malts, but the most striking aroma is that of citrus. And, with any IPA, the hops are noticeable.  Taste: Similar to the smell, the citrus is most striking. Nice, crisp taste. Very drinkable for an IPA.  Mouthfeel: Wonderful consistency. Not particularly thick, but not watery either. Very refreshing for an IPA. The carbonation might be to thank for that.  Overall: I'm not typically one who enjoys citrusy beers, but I really, really like the Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA. The citrus is present but not overwhelming. The same goes for the hops.

The smell is a little mild but brings a nice floral character. It has a strong bitterness with a fine emphasis on hops and a fair blend of malt that pinches the cheeks a bit in the mouth and scores well for me as an IPA. This is another great beer from Dogfish.

10099,6108,FanofHefe,4.35,Catching up on another one from notes today.  Pours a light amber/golden colored body with a frothy egg-shell white two-finger head. Good retention and nice lacing.  Nice hop aroma leaning toward the sweeter side of the hops and featuring floral notes and citrus aromas of orange and tangerine. Some light bready malt in the background.  The flavors are a notch above the aroma. Nice hop bitterness with a little more pine and grapefruit than noticed in the aroma. Very good balance of the hop bitterness and the malty sweetness.

A pungent sort of grapefruit citrus is present as well.  Taste: Delicious. The sort of hoppy ""grapefruit"" taste is up front but not excessively powerful. It segueways into a very pleasant biscuity flavor. Definite malt presence. This beer avoids the sort of punch-in-the-face hop flavor of really strong IPAs that some people find too much. Somewhat piney throughout as well, and the bitter grapefruit citrus distinctive to IPAs persists pleasantly even through the emergence of the biscuit/malt flavor.  Mouthfeel: Nice, nothing outstanding but is quite smooth and goes down easy.

Doesn't leave too much lacing on the glass, but a very pretty beer.  A strong and powerful aroma of citrus hops in the nose, mainly orange and grapefruit aromas. Smells much more in line with the West Coast style of IPAs than I would have imagined.  Unfortunately, the taste isn't quite as good as the smell. There's not a significant amount of bitterness or hop pungency. It's a highly drinkable and delicious IPA, but not as hoppy as I would have liked or would have guessed from a brewer like Dogfish who likes to do things BIG or not at all.

The aroma is a nice mix of hops backed with a nice malt. The hops are spicy and citrus.  This is a great English IPA.

Smell: 4 Combo of very malty nose with strong citrus hops with some piney notes too.  Taste: 4 More pinyness flavor, versus citrus aroma, from hops with nice balance of malt.

Mouthfeel: 4.5 A smooth moderate thickness feel with mild-moderation carbonation. Very refreshing, but never too thin.  Drinkability/Overall: 4.5 Super easy to drink. Pairs well with food, esp spciy, because it has a more balance profile. Would love to have fresh on tap because beer does suffer with age relatively quickly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,bmwats,3.88,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint.  A: Dark golden hue. Heavy carbonation. Pours about a 1 finger, bubbly, white head. Settles slowly. Some decent spider web lacing.  S: Rye bread, oregano, and lots o' pine.  T: Very hoppy and piny, nicely comboed with a grainy flavor. Not all hop, here.  M: Dry and hoppy with a light body, but mouth-puckering dry finish.  D: Sip and savor.  Atmosphere is really nice. Good body (always a fine quality for beers and other things), nice bubbly head, and plenty o' lacing. Nose is good sourdough bread with plenty of pine and a little savory. Flavor is not complex, but does have a decent bready flavor, not overwhelmed by the hop bite. Overall, this is a really good quaff.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,lynchtae,4.17,"The 60 minute pours light amber with persistent white head. The aroma is very subtle, not too complex or outstanding. The taste is suprisingly complex with nice earthy notes, toasty malts, and lots of hops. Balanced bittereness, alcohol and sweet malty. This beer is much better put together than their stupid show.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TheWhiskerReview,4.3,"Pours an apricot tinted gold with a solid one finger white head. Leaves a nice ring and lovely lace throughout.  Smells wonderfully hoppy- leafy, grassy, piney and earthy- with background notes of toasty biscuit malt, candied lemon peel and dried apricot. Awesome.  Well, with 60 minutes instead of 90, and 6% ABV instead of 9%, it pretty much tastes like the 90 with 2/3 the intensity. Funny though how I seem to be drinking it more than half as fast. Delicious.  Overall another great Dogfish brew. It pretty much takes the brilliant 90 and adds a bit more sessionability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,bballmj2k,4.23,"Bottled 3/25/11 - freshest I've been able to find DFH products in a while.  Appearance - Golden orange, clear with few fingers of head from a vigorous pour. Beautiful.  Smell - Great fresh hop smell. Grassy and piney. Hints of the dominant citrus smell from a fresh Hopslam.  Taste - Crisp, citrus, grassy, pine flavors. Sweet malt in the background. Not nearly as sweet and cloying as 90 minute.  Mouthfeel - Really nice and light. Crisp carbonation helps to cleanse the palate after the sweetness. Delicious.  Overall - Great beer, nice sessionable IPA. No wonder this can't stay on the shelves.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,SMcGuire33,3.8,"A- Deep gold/Light brown with a great off-white head that leaves a nice lacing.  S- A citrusy & piney smell that is very pleasing.  M- Plenty of carbonation and a wonderful aftertaste that leaves a great mouthfeel.  T- At first, an orange citrusy feel that turns into a piney bitter taste that lingers long after the sip. Lighter taste than other IPA's I've tried, but still very good.  O- A very enjoyable yet unique IPA. It's not as bitter as others due to the orangey taste at the beginning, but it is refreshing and very drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BeerFMAndy,4.5,"12 oz bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada imperial pint. 6% ABV, Bottled on 02/01/11C  I don't blame DFH for pulling from the state as it took a while to find a fresh six-pack of this.  A - Crystal clear with a brilliant golden amber color and a low but well-retained white head. Thick lace coats the glass.  S - Light notes of grapefruit and pineapple bookend a largely floral hop aroma. Sweeter pils and Munich malts seem to comprise the malt bill offsetting the hops in just the right way.  T - The flavor is well-balanced to the point of near perfection. A great level of semi-sweet malts lay the foundation for the hops to impart their magic. Perfect balance of floral aspects to juicy, citrusy fruit and a hint of resin.  M - Smooth and crisp with a medium body and clean finish. Mildly bitter with a touch of dryness that lingers.  O - One of the best IPAs out there, it's near perfect in every regard. Great drinkability!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,NickRivers,4,"A - Pours a nice copper with about a finger and a half of slightly off-white head.  S - Lots of grassy earthy aromas, little bit of malt, a lot of citrus.  T&M - Again lots of earthy, grassy hops, really crisp and carbonated at the front, medium bodied in the back with a slight hop bite.  O - Overall a great session beer just a little expensive.  Right off the bat I felt this beer was not an IPA. It was a little too light for me. I figured this craft brew to be a little edgy, but turned out its a little beginner. Don't get me wrong this beer is incredibly drinkable, very refreshing, but 90 Minute is the way to go. Fasho. Also as a session beer its a little pricey, personally I would be happy with some Torpedo or Ranger. Not dissing the beer just saying the hype behind DFH should be they're 90, however if someone asked what a good introduction to craft IPA's would be, I would recommend this, especially for people who aren't that into hops. The 90 is another great non-hophead beer due to its insane malt and hop balance. I would imagine the 75 is somewhere in between(Obviously), which makes me eager to try it. Pick this one up along with the 90, maybe try a side-by-side? Stay thirsty my friends.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The body is a crisp clear pale yellow gold color, looks ultra filtered.  The smell is definitely different than the uber hopped west coast style IPA's, this one is more rounded, I get some bitter and floral hop qualities as well as a solid honey malt scent. This makes for quite an interesting combination, like bittersweet honey.  The flavor is solid, I get a nice malt backbone of grains and honey as well as a hop profile which starts off sweet to lure you in, and then finishes with a smooth bitterness. I really like the smooth bitter quality of it, different than the hop bite I am so used to.  The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing up front but is milky smooth on the back end, great from start to finish.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T: It is perfectly balanced and fresh with floral and citrusy hops combined with light caramel, berries, and a little breadiness.  M: The body is thinner that most IPAs and it has moderate carbonation but a crisp finish.

10099,6108,CrookedStill,4.04,"Poured from 12oz bottle into tulip. Light golden/straw, slightly hazy with a nice white head that quickly dissipates. Nice lacing. Pretty average.  Grassy/lemon notes upfront. Sweetness towards the end. Hops aren't as prevalent as I expected but are there and noticeable none the less.  Wow! Citrus hits the palette first then quickly the bitterness makes itself present but is very well balanced against a strong malt backbone. Excellent balance makes for an easy drink and no one element dominates. No trace of alcohol.  The body is a touch thin but it doesn't take away from the enjoyability. Medium carbonation is very refreshing and really accentuates the citrus notes. Again a bit average.  Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Very well balanced and easy to drink. A perfect beer for a hot summer evening. While a few aspects are fairly average, the beer as a whole is very solid and I'll be sure to try and keep this one in stock. If you're new to IPAs I highly recommend making this one to start with as it has a wonderful yet slight bitterness with a strong malt presence without being overly sweet.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

As the smell....the taste is an offputting earthy cat pee. Not getting any citrus/grapefruit....no pine....no herbal notes...nothing I look for in an IPA.  M - Ok...but flavor is just too objectionable.  O - Once again; DFH continues to disappoint. I really want to find something of theirs that I like as I feel rather lonely as one of the few who just dislikes their stuff. But; my palate is the judge and does not deceive me. This was just not enjoyable at all. I dumped it halfway through and opted for a Goose Island IPA instead, to satisfy my IPA fix.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Sharp grassy hops and citrus fruits. Some caramel malt and a litttle yeast.  Taste. Pine, grass, yellow grapefruit. Just as hint of sweetness and some fresh bread. Some lingering bitter hops. Alcohol well hidden.  Mouthfeel. Lighter body with medium-strong carbonation. Crisp and refreshing with good flavor.  Drinkability. Great IPA. Hops are showcased with just enough malt.

10099,6108,mjpolzin,3.48,"Almost had more of a bite to me than the 90 minute IPA so I am thinking I should score this one higher because it almost seems like I am getting more beer for my buck with the 60 minute than with the 90. Overall though, I never have thought the DFH's IPAS have had as much of kick as say the Double Illumination by Central Waters. That can be a good thing though if you want something that is smooth and goes down easy.  I noticed the hops right away in both the smell and the taste. And again, I almost noticed it more than with the 90 minute. Had a nice bitter taste, the carbonation is pleasant and I thought the nice amber orangish color was pleasing as well. I all of a sudden have noticed a little taste of grapefruit in most IPAs I have been drinking. I get that here as well although not as much as I would in a double.  I do like a beer with a little more kick than this and new with only 6 abv it wasn't going to provide totally what I was looking for.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T/M: The flavor follows the aroma although there is a slight ""buttered popcorn"" flavor (diacetyl)...  I know I've had this beer in the past and it was outstanding.

I get strong sweet notes especially ripe ruby red grapefruit and floral. There is a good amount of buttermilk biscuit here too.  T: Huge hoppiness comes through in waves of ruby red grapefruit, very herbal and floral, then slapping bitterness. This isnt hops out of control as there is a strong raw dough and buttermilk biscuit again that keeps things even.  M: Medium with good amount of carbonation  O: Liked this one a lot.

T - Sweeter on the tongue than I was expecting, but this isn't a bad thing. The hops cut on through very swiftly after the initial taste - followed by various spicy characteristics.

S: Huge hops (piney, bitter, chronic) with thick balanced malts. Touch of fruit but minor in comparison to the hops. Fruit resembles apricots and passion fruit.  T: Hops up front, more of that piney chronic flavors, followed by very balanced malts that subdue the bitters. More bitter notes in the noes then in the body but this is a sipper. Thick with lemon grass, apricot sweetness  M: Full bodied with a heavy coat over the palate. Stickiness like cotton candy lingers from the fruit, but refreshing feeling after you sip.

Very nice aromas of pine and citrus with biscuits or bread dough. The smell is this ale's best quality, in my opinion, followed closely by its flavor. The taste is more citrus with a one two punch of bitter grapefruit and sweeter tangerines. The malt backbone stands up well and keeps things fairly well balanced. Not as yeasty tasting as the aroma might suggest.  The mouth feel is average, and for me is the only chink in Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA's armor. A little thinner than I might prefer, and that was foretold by its clarity. For others this might be a plus, so add a point here if you like your IPAs with slightly lighter body than I do.

The nose: fresh-baked bread, some sourdough, orange, pine. Pretty even keel between malt and hops.  Lots of malt again in the flavor. Baked bread, grass, light pine, very subtle bitterness, maybe some honey-drizzled sourdough biscuits and grapefruit.  The mouth is full of a heavy, assaulting carbonation that fizzes up the beer considerably as it moves. Medium body with nice heft. No booze is noticeable, but the carb could be toned down a bit.

10099,6108,NATOuk,4.47,"Appearance A sparklingly clear, golden liquid, good visible carbonation with a thin white head forming and falling back to a white ring around the glass.  Smell Hops, hops and more hops! Strong sweet, zingy citrus notes, almost 'oily' in that the smell clings to your nose, a warning almost of just how potent this brew is and what to expect from it in terms of taste. There seems to be slight grassy notes as well. I love the smell of hops, in particular the very citrus-like American hops used in a lot of American IPAs and this one is just heavenly.  Taste Very well balanced. A strong citrus sweetness which coats the front of the mouth for quite some time before a noticeable bitterness develops at the back. Quite odd to taste both the strong citrus sweetness at the front so distinctly from the bitterness at the back. The middle is a little weak but most likely because the start and finish are to distinctive. Delightful.  Mouthfeel This feels like a more viscous texture in comparison to most beers, not too much but just enough to discern. Medium body and medium carbonation. The carbonation seems strong when pouring but doesn't actually come through in the mouthfeel where you might expect strong acidity.  Drinkability Wonderful. A good strength at 6% ABV which brings out the flavours without adding too much of an alcohol taste to the mix. Strong flavours but not overpowering and the balance between the citrus sweetness and hop bitterness allows this to be a fine session beer for those that like a stronger tasting beer, or hops in particular.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Nice smell to the nose and gets better as this brew cools down.  T- Strong hop bite that is refreshing and powerful. The balance of flavor with this beer makes it an easy drinker. Everything is fresh and the hops, malts, small citrus an wheat work absolutly perfect in this beer. IPA lovers IPA..  M- Great on the mouth, low carbonation and great hop perkiness.

Smell - real good smelling beer! Well defined, i can pick up some pine and hops, some slight malts in the rear, picking up some citrus as well.  taste - great tasting beer, there is a good mild taste to this beer. From the smell, i expected the pine to be more dominant, it wasn't. the beer is smooth, u can pick up the pine and malts early, with the citrus and hops at the end.  mouthfeel - the carbonation brings the dominant smells to life while maintain the mild drinking beer flavour. found the citrus and pine came to life.  drinkability - another fantastic ipa i wish i could drink every day. one of the more smooth ipa i had in a long time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,LBBeer,3.3,"From bottle to a shaker pint at Boston Quincy Marriott.  A--Pours a light brown/dark straw with about a half inch of ivory froth. As I wait for the brew to warm the head collapses leaving some nice lacing.  S--Again my friends at the Marriott are a bit too heavy on the refrigeration and chilled glass, so I'm waiting for my brew to warm. I get a nice blended aroma of malt and hops, with hops making a push for aromatic supremacy.  T--First taste is a thin malt note with a touch of bittering hops. Definitely not bringing the hops expected of a modern day IPA. As I work though the pint there is some improvement, but I don't feel that it ever escapes the orbit of being just a really good pale ale.  M--Dry and malty, but maybe not enough structure.

I saw this on the chalkboard, and got it instead.  Came out a crystal clear dark orange with a thin white head on top. Light lace left behind. Big notes of pine, citrus, cleaning solution, grass. Very fresh and aromatic.  Good mouth on this as it's crisp when it needs to be, but still finishes smooth and clean. Wonderful flavors of bitter fresh hops, grapefruit, orange. Grassy finish.

Taste has a nice hop bite up front, with floral and citrus notes similar to the smell. Finish is mostly malt without the lingering bitterness often present in the style. Good taste overall, but not in the upper echelon of the style, too malty.  Medium mouthfeel with a slight oiliness and low carbonation. Pretty smooth overall.

10099,6108,Shrews629,4.03,"Appearance - Very clear straw to light orange in color. A few bubbles coming up from the bottom. An off white, fluffy, rather large head. Very good retention and lacing. The head really hung around for the entire beer.  Smell - This beer has a more clean smelling grassy type of aroma combined with some piney notes. Also, hints of some fruity orange and tinges of grapefruit. The fruitiness is really more of a background fragrance.  Taste - The grapefruit is a bit more prominant in the flavor, but it is still a touch relaxed. Some well rounded bitterness plus the grassy, grainy zing follow the aroama characteristics. A minor tone of the alcohol, but nothing out of place.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, medium/light bodied mouthfeel. Rather dry and some aspects of the alcohol warmth.  Drinkability - This brew seems like a combination of an IPA, a Belgian Strong Ale and a Pilsener. It's very well balanced, even, enjoyable and drinkable. It's very genuine and good. I like it. This could be a great introductory IPA. Worth a try for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,voteforgoat,1.76,"Bottled 1/15/11  Appearance - Extreme clarity and golden color ( basically the same color as miller high life). Surprising for an IPA, looks more like a pilsner. No head at first. Second pour was more vigorous and created a head. Very nice lacing as I drink, but that's the only strong point.  Smell - peachy smell, slightly grassy. Aroma is very weak.  Taste - bitterness upfront. hops backed by slight burnt rubber taste. the more i drink, the less I enjoy the beer. Imagine slimy aluminum/wet towel taste. I wish I could describe it more precisely. Long-lasting and unpleasant after-taste, which worsens as you empty your glass. If you've experienced a ""gusher bug"", you will know the taste I'm talking about.  Either 1) my taste buds are off tonight, 2) this beer is no good or 3) I have a bad bottle.  Mouthfeel - thin beer, thin head, feels quite dry.  Drinkability - Blech! It will be painful to go through this 6-pack.  --- In fairness, I cracked open a second bottle because I was so surprised at how bad this one was. This is my first time drinking it. The second one was a better, but my taste buds are annihilated so I am unable to review it. And yes, I am familiar enough with IPAs. While not a strict hop-head by any means, I do love me some hops.

Balanced with some biscuity malts but overall pretty mild. I like this as a ""basic"" IPA, easy to drink and refreshing.  M - Good balance as expected, medium body and carbonation.

Delicious and complex blending of breads, nuts and just a little bit of hops on the finish. If its not an oxymoron, to call it elaborately straightforward, that's what this is. I can very easily see this being an prime beer for late summer all the way through winter.  Mouthfeel is relatively simple. Not chewy, but not completely effervescent either.  Drinkability is good, not overly filling, but the taste is strong enough that I don't think I would want more than 2 at the absolute most.  In general, a deliciously unique beer that has a lot of potential for food pairings, IMO.

Lots of juicy summerfruit character. A little bit of a pilsner aroma, but dominated by the amarillo.  Taste mirrors the smell. Lots of amarillo pulling through in the taste of peaches and apricot. Low on bitterness, but a slight pine quality. Malts make a presence in the background, but it's a balancing presence without hurting the awesome hop flavor. Mouthfeel is good.

10099,6108,Dave128,4.15,"This beer will always stand out to me as my first IPA. Back then I drank it out of the bottle at almost ice cold temperatures.. Oh the shame...  A - More golden than light amber. Particles suspended in the beer give it a unique look and a beautiful swirling presentation after the rigorous pour. Just a finger of off-white head that quickly dissipates into a paperthin disk on top.  S - great example of a citrusy smelling IPA. When you pop a fresh one, the grapefruit smell hits your nose immediately.  T - Yummy!! sweet and citrusy up front and actually not too bitter in the finish. A very good basic IPA that is somewhat of an gateway into bigger rougher IPAs and DIPAs. A little alcohol escapes at the end.  M - Excellent. Medium bodied. I was a little concerned about this one because it spent a few nights frozen in my car. Carbonation seemed spot-on though.  D - Although I love the beer, I will say this... After a few drinks, it starts to beg for more. I wanna have something more complex. But still a great beer and I will be looking forward to picking up some for my beer stock in the future.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Hellabeerguzzler,4.1,"I'm not in agreement. I know DFH has been, in some opinion, over-exposed (at least of the east coast) but I can say objectively that this is a nice ale.  I find the balance between sweet and sour to be very good. I find it almost a little hop forward for an single IPA. It's appearance is great. On tap this keg was in it's prime and pouring beautifully. It was a 1 inch thick head (maybe 3 cm) and settled to a chunky froth with nice lacing.  As most of my other favorite beers, it is tasty and I find the mouthfeel just light and bubbly. The drinkability is excellent and it is not hard for my to put quite a dent in a 6 pk that usually goes for 10.50 a few miles away.  Like Two Hearted (which is better IMO), this is a beer I can keep in the fridge and have turned a few people onto craft brews with this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Janderson91,3.52,"A - Pours crystal clear gold color with a 2 finger white head. Leaves good lacing. Looks great.  S - Smell for an IPA is surprisingly malty. Much too sweet in my opinion.  T - Taste is similar. Starts with a nutty, malt sweetness, some minor hop bitterness in the back with a sweet pretty dry finish. Again just too malty for the style.  M - Mouthfeel is pretty good and crisp.  D - Very easy to drink.  A good beer but far from my favorite offering from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,laituegonflable,3.57,"Pours a shiny amber-gold, clear body with small amount of slow bead. Head is whispy and slightly sunken to a film with a few isolated clouds of bigger bubbles. Lace is beautiful; thick and sticky. Looks alright.  Smells extremely nutty and sweet. Massive chestnut character, with a smell similar to Chinese chestnut cake. Lots of malt, caramelly and sticky and just a very faint touch of hop at the back, mild citrus mostly. Pleasant smell, but I do feel the hops are subdued here.  Taste is similarly sweet. Kicsk off with lots of sticky malt, caramelly with a slight twist like tonic water or something, just a slight phenol on the early palate. Develops a large amount of nutty flavour on the back, mostly chestnutty with hazelnut tinges to it as well. Maybe a slight citric hop on the back, but more dishwasher detergent-esque than fresh fruit, and not a lot at that. It's bitter, though, just not that vibrant, piquant bitterness I expect from an IPA. Not bad, in fact pretty nice, just some key notes absent.  Fairly full body, at least on the front, then quite watery late and caps off very dry. Not a wonderful texture.  Yeah, I might drink one or two of these, but it doesn't wow me in a drink-all-night kind of way.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,kflack,3.94,"A: Pours with a two finger head, very nice lacing. Nice amber color.  S: Lots of citrus and other fresh fruit, apricot? Some pine as well.  T: Maybe I have been drinking too many DIPA's, but this is really mild. Bottled on 1/17/11 so it must be me. The hops are there, just not in full force. Not bad at all, just expecting more bite.  D: Very smooth. May need to review the 90 minute next.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Genuine,4.3,"I don't know how I didn't review this already, welp, here goes!  Pours a very nice golden amber in color, which a 2-3 finger pale tan head sat. The head does leave beautiful lacing down the side of the glass.  Smell - hops jump right out at you before you even bring the glass up to your nose. Citrus and pineapple notes hit me first, with pine later on.  Taste - Full of pine notes, the hop bitterness is very welcoming to my palate. But, there is a very strong malt backbone that'll keep the hops in check, for this slightly balanced IPA.  Mouthfeel - medium, delicious resin coating the palate, slightly chewy. The carbonation is perfect for this one. I'm usually a big fan of DFH's mouthfeel.  Drinkability - awesome IPA for the hophead. I love IPA's and this one is always a staple in my fridge. I have no problem having one right after the other. The flavor doesn't get tiring. Delicious from the first sip to the last. A very solid offering from DFH!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BizzyQU,3.94,"A- Nice dark honey color with a white head, loved the contrast  S- Floral and hoppy but with nothing too special going on  T- Slight citrus, pretty much a lighter 90min, tasty though.  M- Good carbonation, soft and nice  D- Drinkable, solid choice when you want to throw a couple back  I liked this beer, two of my bottles were a too carbonated, not sure what happened there, but they were undrinkable. I disregarded the duds and enjoyed the rest of the beers from my six pack. I look forward to soon trying this beer on tap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ngeunit1,4.1,"A - Pours a clear amber-orange color with two-fingers of frothy white head. The head has solid retention, eventually reducing down to a layer, and laces nicely down the glass.  S - Aroma is full of citrus (grapefruit) and piney hops. There is also come nice sweet caramel malts in the background that blend nicely.  T - Starts off the bat with a mix of piney hops with some nice citrus flavor and some maltiness in the background. Through the middle, the bitterness really comes through nicely alongside some more citrus flavor (most notably grapefruit). Finish has a nice blend of bitterness, citrus, hop, and a touch of malt flavor. Very nice hop profile.  M - Medium-light bodied with a nice amount of assertive carbonation. The hop flavor leaves a nice dry feeling in the mouth afterwards giving an overall crisp feeling to the beer.  D - Extremely drinkable. The hop profile here is really nice, and the beer is super smooth and crisp. There is just enough malt in the taste and the aroma to provide a bit of balance to the hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,vitrael,4.11,"A: Poured into conical pint glass, crystal-clear and golden with a small white head. Nice licing and carb trails. Just a really good looking beer.  S: Good citrusy hop smell, and quite strong. I smell it before I even pour it.  T: Characterized by its strong and lingering hop bitterness. Hop flavor is similar to limes. Malt flavor of this is significantly lighter and subtler than in the 90 Minute IPA I love, taking the back seat to the hops. At the end of the taste I get just a bit of raw barley in the middle of my tongue. If you ask me this beer is just slightly out of balance, but not at all unpleasant, particularly to the hophead.  M: Light body and average carbonation that I expect from a Pale Ale. No objections.  D: As a big IPA fan, I can drink this fast.  Overall a refreshing and sessionable IPA. It is not my favorite--I like big beers and the DFH 90 Minute IPA is pretty much the standard by which I judge big IPAs. Regardless this is a very affordable and drinkable craft brew that sets many people down the hophead path. Do not underestimate!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,HagueBrook,4,"Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.  A: Amber/copper color with almost no head. Some lacing on the sides.  S: Fruity, with a decidedly tropical smell. More on that with the taste.  T: Nice taste, but I keep getting pineapple along with the hops. Not bad, just not expected. It's kind of growing on me.  M: A small amount of carbonation. Seems about right.  D: A good IPA, but not in 1st place among IPA's I have tried. I would order it again at a bar if it was available.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,lacqueredmouse,3.76,"Bottled June 10, drank Feb 11.  Pours a bright copper-orange colour and an initially frothy head that collapses to an oily film and some decadently thick lacing. Body decently heavy for an IPA, with some good static carbonation. Looks pretty good all up.  Nose has certainly lost some hops, I fear this may too old a bottle. Grainy malt notes with some honey sweetness. A bit of malt liquor booziness to it as well, along with a slight greenness that may be the residuals of hoppiness. Certainly not a lot of hops on the aroma.  Taste is a lot better, with the bittering hops giving a pleasant nutty briskness to the finish. Front is full of light fruit and honey characters, but it gives it a decent basis for the mild bitterness on the back. Very nicely balanced all up. On the very back, there's a slight dry grain bread character, but it's the only off note on the palate.  Feel is light and mild, smooth enough--in some ways, quite like an English ale.  It's certainly a mild IPA, and while the age on it may detract from the nose, it actually blends things rather nicely on the palate, leaving a smooth and pretty drinkable brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,dataskatt,4.62,"Appearance is a coppery, light amber with a nice head and lacing. The smell consists of floral, grassy notes, with a touch of pine and grapefruit. The hops are prominent and intense without being harshly bitter...perfect for an IPA. The grapefruit flavor is very prominent, with a fresh lemongrass taste. Reminds me of freshly mown Spring grass! The carbonation seems just right...light, fresh mouthfeel. Light tasting enough to be very drinkable... Very nice beer, I would buy again when in the mood for an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,bamadog,4,"Review is from notes taken on 2/2/2011 and poured from the bottle to a pint glass.  Appearance: Pour is a slightly-lighter-than-copper in color and it starts with a big 2 finger slightly off-white head with decent retention; head becomes pockmarked and it looks a little dry and frothy as it slowly fades; body has amazing clarity and it shows quick and strong carbonation bubbling throughout; head eventually fades to a thick and frothy, yet uneven, cap and it leaves pillowy swaths of lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell: A solid nose, to be sure -- definite hop aromas emanate from glass and they are slightly grassy and piney, more grassy though and there is just a slight citric sensibility about them; there is also a bit of a sweet and toasty grain and malt bill.  Taste: I really feel it matches the nose to a ""T"" with one slight variance in that I feel the hops are much more citric on the palate than they are in the nose -- bit of a lemony zest to them and the grassy/piney aspect takes a backseat; the malts are sweet and add some balance, and I almost feel like this bottle may have sat a little bit longer than I would prefer as it kind of subdues the hops a bit; aftertaste is more of a straight-up grassy bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Body is between light and medium in terms of weight, and the carbonation is spot on as it provides a great liveliness but definitely resists coming across as sharp; a thick and sticky coating is left behind and it remains pretty moist.  Drinkability: Definitely solid, but I would say I definitely prefer the 90 minute to it for the bigger and more robust flavors -- on the flip side, the lower ABV and slightly thinner body makes this one a bit more drinkable. Nice flavors, and as always, this would be an excellent beer on a hot summer day as it comes across as very refreshing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,knm,3.88,"This is my first from this brewery, and I am happy to say that it lived up to the hype! A very clean drinking beer. It started with a medium head that cleared quickly. The carbonation stayed good throughout. Smell is of yeast, hops, and whiskey, crazy. Taste is also of yeast, very dry and smooth, yet almost bitter. It almost has a licorice after taste.

10099,6108,Rschis16,3.86,"A: Rich amber color with a smallish pure white head.  S: Smell doesn't hit you outright and that takes away from it. Light hoppiness in the scent.  T: Definitely a good beer and as it's only 6 percent alcohol, that doesn't play much of a role in the taste, but does hit you a little at the very end. The hops are pretty well balanced out and tasty, but not over the top by any means. Finish is dryish and flavorful.  M/D: Carbonation matches the style and doesn't take anything away from the experience. Easy to drink and is a decent example of an IPA.  DFH's 90 minute IPA is however one of my favorite IPAs as it is loaded up with more of the same hop taste, making 60 minute look weak.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

A robust carbonation helps to keep the head a float for a rather long time. There is good lacing around the glass. A well balanced aroma of sweet malts and hops. The hops have a herbal and pine boquet. Now as for the taste. The hops are not as pronounced in the taste as you would think basing your opinion on the aroma. Taste is well balance with neither hop or malt winning the battle. Hops are sutle with flavors of citrus, pine and floral. Malts are sweet with hints of toasted malts and grains. This beer is of a medium body, but leans towards the lighter side. A bit dry with little aftertaste.

IPA's are definitely better fresh even though they were originally designed to last a long time. This one might be a touch old. Bitterness is nice and smooth.

The smell is a veritable banquet of hops, with fruits, pine, and citrus (predominantly grapefruit). A hop-head's delight. The taste is also fantastic. This somehow manages to straddle the boundary between being absolutely refreshing, yet very hoppy and bitter. This is the kind of beer that makes a company's reputation. I hate to talk in hyperboles like that, but this beer is just that good. Miles ahead of it's ""big brother"" 90 Minute. The first burst of flavor is hop resin and grapefruit. Wonderful wonderful hop resin. Then, some fruity characteristics come in, along with a touch of pine and just the right amount of bready malts. A masterclass in IPAs.  The mouthfeel is maybe a little thin, but otherwise satisfyingly sticky. The drinkability is absolutely superb, somehow, while being an absolute hop-bomb, the aftertaste isn't super bitter. It instead somehow manages to be refreshing. The lower ABV for the style probably helps a bit here. Dogfish really have a world class IPA with 60 Minute. It's just an absolutely solid brew available all over the place, and an excellent go-to IPA.

M: Fair amount of carbonation. Not watered down nor excessively full.  D: A go to beer for me. If I want a quality IPA that I know I won't disappointed, I reach for a 6 of these guys.

Smell is a nice healthy dose of grapefruit hops.  Taste is dominated by hops. Grapefruit mostly, with some pine, and even citrus. A perfect beer for hop lovers. Just enough bready malt in the background to balance this one out. Finishes nicely, not too sweet or particularly dry.  After every sip your mouth is left coated with hop resin, awesome. Bitterness on the sides of the tongue is a welcome feeling for this hop head. Goes down quickly. Average ABV and tons of hop flavor make this beer incredibly drinkable.

This one has a slight resin taste to go w/ the pine. Pretty bitter w/ a slight juiciness. Also has a subtle ""onion"" taste to it, which I'm not too fond of. Mouthfeel is good, well carbonated, smooth. Drinkability is alright, low abv helps, but the onion flavor hurts.

10099,6108,jsanford,3.7,"Finally getting around to reviewing this one, been drinking it for years. Poured into my DFH pint.  A - Pours a light orange-gold with a thin white head. A patchy haze is left on the surface after the head dissipates, along with a thin ring. S - Sweet caramel and biscuit malt with an earthy, grapefruit hop profile. T - The caramel malt actually dominates the taste for me, with some grapefruit hops adding some slight bitterness. Much more subdued then I remember, I guess after moving on to 90 Minute this seems tame. M - Slightly watery medium-thin body with crisp carbonation. D - Very drinkable, I could blow through a sixer with ease.  Still a great beer, perfect for a beginner hop-head. Sadly, my tastes have changed significantly and this just doesn't give me that hop explosion I need. Luckily I always have 90 Minute!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Jadjunk,3.88,"#62. It's crazy it took me this long to review something by Dogfish Head but I felt their 60 Minute IPA an ideal beginner beer.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a pint glass at room temp.  (Appearance) Pours a foamy two finger depth head and retention is pretty good. Color is a light orange-gold and clear. Carbonation is average. Appearance is nice. 4  (Smell) Pretty bold hoppy smell. I don't get much else beyond this but hops are fresh and smell somewhat floral, somewhat piney. Possibly some grapefruit and citrus aromas linger with some faint malts beneath the hop bomb. It smells good, perhaps slightly off balance, but good. 3.5  (Taste) Hoppy flavor straight up to a hoppy flavor in the finish. Definitely grapefruit in here, possibly some light citrus peel flavor. A nice interesting toasty flavor comes in on the finish. The balance here is better than in the smell; there is more flavor variety than the nose gave off. 4  (Mouthfeel) Pretty crisp but has frothy and smooth characteristics as well. Medium body. Full flavor. Good. 4  (Drinkability) Easily drinkable IPA. Best taken in moderate amounts, but nothing here holds me back from coming back for more. 4.5  Verdict: A fairly nice beverage, worth a shot. B+ (3.9)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,thatsfine,4.2,"This has a light amber-gold color and a thick white head that leaves nice lacing down the side. The beer is extremely clear, more clear than other IPAs.  The hops are very citrusy and fruity. Smells like a West Coast IPA.  The hops in the taste are very similar to the smell but the difference is the balance in this brew. This is much more balanced than West Coast IPAs, which is a nice change. I love hop bombs but this is great.  Coats the mouth with a nice layer and isn't too bitter.  This is a good IPA that I love on tap and it is pretty easy to put back quite a few. I definitely have a few times and plan to a few more times.

I have always been a fan of Dogfish Head but since I live in a place with little beer culture and alcohol purity laws, it's a bit hard to find the rare and exotic. When I saw this, I grabbed it immediately.  Appearance: Poured a golden orange with nice white head and with decent lacing.  Smell: The nose is rich of citrus, like grapefruit, sweet malts, and big hoppy presence.  Taste: Big hop presence and reasonably dry. Big citrus and flowery hop presence and the back end of the flavor is great too, bitter and semi-earthy.  Mouthfeel: Thick and semi-syrupy.

Laces very well down the glass throughout enjoying the beverage.  Smell: Very strong, grassy and citrusy. Extremely pleasant.  Taste: Boy howdy, this tastes good! Very hoppy as expected though it was not quite as bitter as I thought it would be, which I kind of like.  Mouth: Good, balanced carbonation that is not overwhelming, but still noticeable. Leaves the mouth dry.  Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable. I could see many going down in no time. Excellent in this area.  Overall, in my just over 21 year old beer venture, this is the best IPA I have had (may be the first I have really enjoyed, in fact).

10099,6108,JednoPivoProsim,4.43,"Reviewed 1/10/11:  After a quick sourdough pretzel interlude to cleanse the palate from my Shelter PA review...  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an Ommegang 10 year anniversary tulip. Bottled on date 11/11/10.  Aroma: Hops. And metal. And more hops. Probably one of the most pungent beers I have ever had. I love it already.  Appearance: Awesome. Two inches of bready head. After having lived in Prague 10 years ago and drinking my share of Czech beers in danky basement beer establishments, this is what a beer head should look like. I remember a friend telling me his Czech uncles would order a new beer if the head on their current beers disappeared. Not sure how this applies nor what it means, but that has always stuck with me. As it is, I'm waiting for this head to recede so I can comment that little carbonation cells are forming everywhere, but this head is going nowhere. Otherwise, beautiful golden color.  Flavor: Wow. Hoppy and strong. All the usual suspects - pine trees and fields of citrus wonderment. I like this. A lot.  Palate: This beer is smooth, not heavy and has a strong, lingering aftertaste - which I'm in the mood for right now. I couldn't put away ten of these in a row due to the hoppiness, but 2 or 3 and I'm good to go.  Overall: To be completely honest, I could barely finish one of these not too long ago (then again, I could barely finish a SA Boston Lager not too long before that), but now I'm completely sold on the whole crafty beer, more hops is better deal. Could this be the beer that converts me once and for all to the IBU darkside and beyond?

I don't find the bitterness on the extreme end as some suggest. Hint of grapefruit. Pretty easy drinkin' IPA in my opinion.  M- Adequate carbonation bite. Some creamyness.

Some slight floral and grapefruit notes but it's all hop and all good.  Tastes amazing, words can't really describe. Its clean and crisp and FULL of flavor. I sound like and advertisement right about now but if there is hype, it's deserved and backed up. Please try this if you haven't yet.  Perfect on the mouth, when rolled under the tongue the hops burst onto the taste buds that don't get as much attention  This beer is one of the most drinkable beers I've had.

Thick and creamy white head. Average sized bubbles that hang out for a while.  Smell: Hops, of course. About what I expected for the style. Earthy and grassy, a faint aroma of green wood. Grapefruit?  Taste: Yes, grapefruit, and loads of it. Maybe too much? The earthi-/grassiness are faint in the flavor profile, and the green wood is gone now.  Mouthfeel: Light and refreshing, the hops add a dry finish. The alcohol, though noticeable isn't overpowering.  Drinkability: Very light, not syrupy at all. This bottle is almost gone and I'm wishing I had another which is a good sign.  All in all a good beer.

Fairly fruity nose, more tropical than citrus but both are present up front, with some caramel and dryish malts in the middle. Taste mirrors the nose but the hops appear soon after initial taste, fairly bitter, resiny, but balanced with enough sweetness to maintain tastiness. Medium mouthfeel, above average effervescence. Real drinkable and tres tasty. Upon reflection I prefer this to the 90 minute, which the last few times I've had it has come across a fairly boozy. 60 minute is more balanced, and easier on my pour liver.

There's a floral note running though the whole drink. More rounded citrus hops return at the end and extend into a medium finish.

Biscuity-malty, but not sweet. A touch fruity and tangy. Does not overwhelm the palate like many IPAs. Smooth, somewhat resinous mouthfeel and soft medium carbonation. 6 percent ABV is perfect for the style -- I didn't know DFH made beers under 7 percent! Actual drinkability is very high.

Couldn't pour the entire beer into a pint glass without holding some back. head is pillowy and persistant. As it settles in the middle, the sides remain.

Some acohol warmth. Malt sweetness and esters balanced by the resinous hop aroma and bitterness. Very well crafted.  M - Creamy and thin at the same time.  D - These go down quick.

Pretty much on par with 90 minute ipa, has the burnt hop flavor, the same spices and malts. What i enjoy about this beer is its not so loaded with sugar and the burnt spice flavor isnt as strong and overpowering as the 90 minute ipa. Also the alcohol is lower so you can enjoy the yeast and hops much more.  Mouthfeel - Its pretty hoppy and spicy so mouth gets warmed up, and tounge gets bittered. The burnt spice still is present, and leaves a odd afteraste but not as bad. Leaves mouth a little dry but its not bad.  Drinkabilty - If you're like me and cant stand the 90 minute ipa, then give this a shot. Its pretty smooth and hoppy. At 6% you can have a few without any problems.

M: Light, easy, nice carbonation, not overly carbonated. Perfect balance.  D: Could drink this all night long. Quite possible the best balanced IPA.  This might be my favorite beer.

The most exceptional appearance characteristic is how see through this beer is... it looks shiny and sparkling and totally see-through.  Bouquet is a great bread smell that isn't big, isn't small, just straight forward as if fresh bread from the oven. Hops as well, slight stone milled barley/rye like as well, slight toast, everything is just very balanced, nothing dominates they just smell in contrast real well and take turns.  Upon tasting you get a sense that for 6 ABV a weak beer is coming, and it isn't. Great body and everything in the nose comes to play on your palate. There is a lot going on in this sucker, chew texture, toast barley rye hops come through in the taste... all of them with perhaps some slight resin, and to match, a pleasant grapefruit finish (not a big one though it's shared with hop balance). Some earthy characteristics also with just a hint of dirt.  Drinkabilty is 100% give me another. This is the American IPA I judge and benchmark all IPAs by.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,JMD,4.42,"A: Pours a light copper/auburn color with fluffy eggshell head that fades slowly. Leaves nice lacing down the glass.  S: Big juicy hop aroma. Citrus and tropical fruit dominate, piney and earthy notes as well.  T: Nicely balanced flavor. Bready malt and sweet carmel upfront. Followed by waves of ruby red grapefruit, pineapple and hints of mandarin orange. Nice earthiness as well. Some light pine and herbs.  M: Medium bodied and smooth.  D: This is a great IPA. Hoppy yet balanced, and extremely drinkable. Another solid offering from Dogfish head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Split between two snifters, shared with family member. Pours a pure apple juice color, 1-finger head that reduces to a nice thin film, better-than-average lacing. Aroma of some grapefruit, pineapple, and slight aroma of fir tree. The hops are pleasant and light on the nose. Taste of pine and citrus hops are balanced with some bread-like malt.

10099,6108,Beertinez,4,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours golden with a white, 1 finger head.  Aroma is hops and citrus. Picking up grapefruit and another fruity smell. Something like apricot or orange peel.  Taste is mostly a grapefruit kind of bitter sweetness at the start and stays with the hoppy finish. Hops here are more citrus than piney, compared to the 90 Minute IPA.  Medium-bodied, crisp, and refreshing. Sessionable IPA.  Overall, the 60 Minute IPA is worth a try. If you're looking for a sessionable IPA or have yet to try an IPA, the 60 Minute is the way to go. I prefer the 90 Minute IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,masey222,4.25,The look of it is pretty decent a golden orange color with a fast falling head and fair lacing... The smell is not strong but is filled with fruit notes and some light malts along with a decent hop that is a pleasant floral but not over the top... the taste is very refreshing and crisp/clean there isn't a whole lot of hop the comes out just the fruit and malt sweetness but the hop that dose come through is pleasant and for lack of a better term delicate... The feel is decent moderate carbonation and good density.... Overall it was a nice ipa one of my favorite thus far but not perfect.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Im getting some faint pine and resin but not one single feature is coming out.  T - Again, much like the smell, the taste is really subdued. Im not getting a lot of hop flavor that I require from an ipa. Not much going on here for me.  M - This is really one of the most redeaming qualities of this beer. Its crisp, dry and thin. Quite refreshing, but not what I expect from the style.  D - Its super drinkable, but im having a hard time calling this an ipa.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

A - Pours a nice deep yellow golden color with a good 2 - 3 finger head that recedes and leaves a nice lacing around the top of the glass.  S - A little weak in the nose. Would like a little more hop. It's not bad, it's just that there isn't much there.  T - It's a pretty tasty brew. Interesting combination of hops and flavor none of it is overpowering. The beer is just really well done.  D - Goes down really smooth. Working on pint # 4 while watching Sunday night football. I don't even feel as if I've had one ;-)  M - A little thin if anything. This might be because I've been drinking some heavier bodied beers lately. Other than that it's well carbonated.  Can't go wrong with this.

A: Pours a hazy golden hue with a slight amber tint to it, nice fat head and tons of lacing from start to finish.  S: Floral hop upfront that dissipates quickly, fermented fruit with a sweet grainy finish - pretty nice but nothing out of the ordinary.  T: Nice piney hop - citrus bight, peppery and floral, balanced well with nice fruit flavor (apricot maybe) and sweet malt. Super tasty but definitely on the safe side of IPA's, meant for more of the general market and less for the true hop head.  M: Medium-bodied but on the lighter side of it, good carbonation for the style, not much bitterness from the hop.  D: Easy all night drinker for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,kevinconroy,3.9,A-The appearance of this beer is nothing that stands out to me It has a clear light golden color. This is not very important to me for this style of beer as taste is everything for this category for me  S-For being an American pale ale this beer really does not have as strong of a hop aroma as I would like. The smell for me is more sweet malty with the hops coming through in the end  T-This beer is a great tasting American Pale Ale. Definitely top notch taste. Although weak in the appearance and smell categories this beer has the taste of everything I look for in a great APA. Not over overwhelmingly bitter; near perfect hop and malt flavor.  M- the mouth feel for this beer is very nice and crisp. It has a good balance of bitterness and malt flavors with a nice foaminess that goes throughout  D-This is definitely a beer that can be drank all night. Very easy to drink. This beer goes great with food and is very refreshing. I had this beer with a Colby Jack Grilled Cheese with tomatoes. This beer was great to quench my thirst and help the food go down. Every sip turned out to be half a glass full of this stuff  Overall Rating- This beer is a top notch APA. Although weak in color and smell this beer has a taste that out shines its weaknesses. Taste for me is the most important quality in a beer. I also love the fact that this beer is bottle conditioned old school style. Out of 100 I would give this beer a 88 and would say that it keeps up with the best of this style of beer. Its no Odell but its damn good anyway,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

There's nothing wrong with the smell, but if I didn't know, I might not be able to pin this as an IPA...maybe an ESB.  T: Same story here. Its very balanced; you get candy flavours first, then citrusy hops follow; pretty one dimensional.  D: Loses a point for being a bit boring, but the alcohol is completely hidden, which I believe was the point of this beer.  Overall: I understand balance is key in this brew, but I drink IPAs because I like the taste of IPAs. This beer is way to one-note and forgettable to rave about. There are just too many other much better IPAs in this country.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,DAVEnHOPS,4.02,"Hmm.. Balance is key in this one.  S - Citrus hops of front. That's all I can really get out of it. Still good.  T - Hop bitterness up front, with citrus flavors coming through right after. Orange peel, and a little grapefruit. Not overly bitter, which allows the caramel malt to come through slightly at the end.  D - Love the balance of flavors in this one, so in that respects its very drinkable.

Nose: Hops, Cedar and faint citrus notes. Slight alcohol smell, very woody for an IPA  Taste: Incredibly well balanced. Slightly bitter, but the majority of the hops are in the nose. In my opinion, the perfectly balanced IPA. Bitterness is there, but balanced well by an apparently superb malt selection.  Mouthfeel: Standard for the style; thinner overall.  Drinkability: Higher alcohol than CoorsWeiser, but something I'd have no problem drinking 9 of.  This beer doesn't leave me wanting for anything. Not really a strong IPA character; but as an overall session beer, the best I've ever had. Sam should consider doing a batch of this guy with some Belgian yeast.

Aroma was hoppy, floral, slight spicey character... again, I'd expect more from an IPA.  the mouthfeel leaves you satisfied, and makes up for any lack in smell - the mouthfeel also remedies any failures of the lack of bitterness in the finish... it slowly stays with you...

T: Big hop taste, a little bitter from the hops with a smooth finish with a little bitter hop linger.  M: Not overly carbonated, with a nice clean, crisp taste on the tongue.

10099,6108,Mora2000,4,"The beer pours a light orange color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the orange citrus with some bready malt and piney hops mixed in. The flavor is reminiscent of orange juice. There is a ton of hop flavor, but the bready malt balances out the bitterness and keeps the beer very well balanced. I also get some pine notes in the flavor as the beer warms. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. An American classic that everyone should try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TheBrewo,4.42,"We pour a brew of medium golden color that is fully transparent, with minimally visible carbonation. It supports a two finger white head of densely packed bubbles, which leave little lacing as they slowly dissipate. Bright hops dominate the nose, which also includes fresh grapefruit, mild green apples, and earthy spices. The taste's front is characterized by a chorus of already balanced malts and hops. As the sip progresses, the hops are victorious, and gently glide us into the aftertaste. As the beer departs, we are left with a slice of sweet grapefruit, and a bit of black pepper and alcohol. The low speed at which the head rescinds lends creaminess to the brew, and helps keep the body medium. The carbonation is also medium to high and, while the mouth feels a bit on the dry side, it remains fully satiated. The refreshing and smooth characteristics of the beer keep its drinkability high.  Overall, this quintessential American IPA has been a long favorite of ours. The best thing about it is how the hop character comes through strongly, while simultaneously remaining well balanced, soft, and delicious.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The first I ever had it, I took a whiff of the aroma and said aloud, ""This smells like a British Sunday afternoon."" It really does. The citrusy hops smell is not overpowering. It's an extraordinarily comforting smelling beer.  The taste is all hops as well, but it's not overpowering. This is a well balanced beer taste wise.

Taste- Very hoppy with a somewhat bitter after taste. It's a bit thicker drinking than I would have thought as well.  Mouth- It was a bit malty sticky wasn't a bad thing just a suprise.

The most amazing thing is the aroma this beer produces. Stupendous, actually. An ideal malt/hop balance that makes you think you might about to be drinking valhalla.  Sadly, the flavor doesn't live up to the smell. It's not bad, but just disappointing in light of the aroma. Hops seemed a little muted, as did the malt. Good citrus in it.

It's got a clean head, strong enough to float a cap, a pleasant smell, and a smooth taste without being too dry or overly bitter.

Appearance-Pours a beautiful golden color, with a hint of pinkish tint when held to sunlight. One finger of white head that leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass.  Smell- First thing you smell is pine, alot of it. Citrus comes in a close second. The smell of the rine comes through after letting it sit for a few minutes.  Taste- Great citrus taste, pine is more of a backnote. Definitly amazing, the fruit taste definitly comes through after the first few hoppy sips.  Mouthfeel- The carbonation hits the front of your tongue, but its not overwhelming. Medium to light body.  Drinkability- This is a great beer, I can enjoy a few of these over a course of a night and not do too much damage to my palate. Definitly one of my favorite beers.

Savored out of a DFH Pint Glass for the review.  A-Pours with a nice, golden, amber color. One to two finger head that lingers for a while. Leaves a huge amount of lacing on the glass as you drink.  S-Great citrusy, hoppy smell. Also traces of a pine smell as well.  T-Really, what can I say. Without a doubt a premium IPA. Great grapefruit, hoppy taste that is perfectly balanced. A nice sweetness backs up the hoppiness so this is not a one-trick pony.  M-Nice carbonation. Not overly ""thick"" but not watery for sure. Leaves a nice aftertaste of hops.  D-Again, what can I really say. This is my everyday, go-to beer. I've drank so many cases of this nectar that it's tough to be totally impartial. A perfect gateway beer (in my opinion) for those who really want to see what all this ""craft beer"" business is all about.  Overall: Highly recommend (if you can't already tell.)

Golden body, nice fluffy head that just sticks to the glass like frosting. Really nice presentation here.  S- Sweet citrus hops and a dash of pine. Pretty fruity/floral nose.  T- Good malt base with a pretty hefty hop bill. Hops are sweet, though, and with the strong malt they may be a bit too much for me. Mostly citrus/floral notes. Gets to be a bit much.. Pretty good balance of malts/hops, but leaning to be a bit too sweet. Nice bitterness in the finish keeps this firmly in 'tasty' territory, although it's not at the head of the class.  M- Good carbonation and body, but there's always this nagging thought that it's just too sweet.  D- Moderate. I just don't dig the hops. Not for me.

The body is a semi cloudy orange with a good Mount of carbonation. Lacing holds well throughout.  S: A dry and earthy hop nose. A medium intensity and overall nice aroma. Not too over powering as to decrease the overall drinkability.  T/M: The front is a crisp opening of mild hops and a light malt snap. The subtle characters are welcomed by a nice refreshing mouthfeel. Body is smooth and silky on the finish. Grapefruit hops notes are found on the finish. A bold malt richness is found on the backbone of is beer. Lingering dryness end this very well balanced IPA. D: This is a very good IPA and is a great choice when looking to session.

This 60 minute was had at the brewery, so I don't think we could have been drinking it fresher.  It pours a clear amber with a finger's width off-white head. A whiff cues up tropical fruits, citrus, a bit of pine. It tastes like it smells (that's what she said?), and finishes clean with a bite of bitterness. I feel bad saying that it's typical when it's so well done, but it takes a lot these days to separate craft American IPA's from one another. With great carbonation and a medium body, this one is like a lot of other solid ones. They're just so damn good!

The hops smell mainly of pine. The overall smell suggest bitterness, but there is a small amount of sweetness to be found in the smell.  T - Initially the taste is rather subdued. The citrus and notes of pine are the main flavours. Almost immediately afterwards the strong flavour of pine resin comes in and makes for a nice bitterness that lasts throughout the entire drink.

Earthy and citrus hop aromas coming from my pint glass, as well as some malty sweetness. Taste follows right along with the nose, piney / fruity hops with just a touch of malt underneath it all.

Malts and caramel are in the forefront of each whiff as well. Soft underlying spiciness pops out as well. Not that taken by the nose  T: the palate unlocks a very crisp, clean, and earthy bitter hop beer. Plenty of heavy malts coated with buttery caramel.

Smell: The smell seems to be sweet with pine and grass scents. It has citrus also.  Taste: Has a nice mellow taste to start. The flavors become more pronounced and lingers toward the finish. It seems to be somewhat dry and bitter and grows on me as I drink more.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation and the mellow taste and bitterness last a while afterwards.

The bitterness lingers perfectly afterwards. I can feel it all over my tongue...true IPA.  D-Low abv which allows you to have a few of these anytime.

T: Starts sweet and ends bitter, in a good way. Bready/Starchy malt with a grass hop bite and a delightful sweetness to it. Again, I get a hopped pilsner vibe, maybe because of the dryness of the beer.  M: I like the carbonation and dryness, yet full bodied quality of this beer.  D: Very drinkable IPA.

10099,6108,CountJustinian,4,"Overall, a very good experience. Not the most complex IPA out there, but hardly a beginner's IPA either. It kicks you in the ass, but with bare feet.  The ale pours gold with a meaningful, creamy head that holds well. Malt is evident everywhere, strong but yielding. Orange rinds leap out of the glass, jockeying with the malt for position. Flavors blend well and travel the mouth in tandem. It spits out bitterness in the exhaust, as one would expect from an IPA. A smoky forest fire flavor lingers for a considerable time after swallow.  Definitely worth having again, but can't see sessioning with this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,jlandis,4.32,"A - Crystal clear light copper in color with fluffy 1 inch head that slowly fades to a thin rim. I'm using the official DFH glass that I got with a case a few months ago, so hopefully this is the optimal drinking glass.  S - Slightly musty simcoe hops that give off an earthy pine and grass vibe. There is also a bit of citrus in the aroma too. This is such a unique aroma, and I'm really looking forward to this beer.  T - Piney earthy bitter hops right up front. Then there is some grass and malt. This beer tastes like it came from the earth, and it is fantastic. I'm sure this comes from the continuous hopping, but the flavor is so grounded, rich and full. There is also a fantastic toasted malt backbone that holds up great with the hops.  M - Moderate body with very subtle carbonation.  This is a fantastic solid beer. A lot of times DFH goes overboard and creates beers that are just hard to swallow, but this one is one of the most approachable. The hops are earthy and the malt is toasty and rich.

It goes down pretty smooth. This IPA is a little on the light and malty side for me.

10099,6108,bernie879,4.22,"Poured into your average pint glass, the copperish golden ale produces a just off white head that beautifully peaked just above at the rim settling to just under a cm after three minutea leaving a nice aftermath of lacing (one which has painted the glass now that I am halfway through it.  The aroma was of refreshing citrusy hops which were pleasant to the nose without being overpowering. The cleanliness also came through as I took the first sip of the light-medium bodied ale which was just carbonated enough to help bring out the taste. Here the piney hops seemed to be much more present as was the maltiness of the beer.  I tend to like an IPA with just a bit of maltiness to it and Dogfish head does just that. It still showcases the hops inherent to the style yet is also has the bready, heartier qualities that I tend to want more of in a beer as fall approaches.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T- Pine bitterness first, citrus and bready towards the middle and a carmel malt finish. After taste consisted of Carmel and pine needles.  M- Standard IPA, light to medium bodied. Fair amount of carb.  D- Carmel malts just over power and make this beer so so. To ""sweet"" like to keep drinking to be honest.  The carmel malt of the beer is to much. I mean come on.

10099,6108,eclaycamp,4.2,"Living in landlocked Kansas, I am unfortunately unable to procure any of Dogfish Head's beer, though as a beer nerd I'm obviously aware of the brand. I've always wanted to try the 60 and 90 minute IPAs, mainly due to the use of the Rube Goldberg contraption that allows the beer to be continuously hopped. But does it actually make the beer taste better? We're going to try and find that out tonight.  We're starting off with the 60 minute IPA. Let me just say that, while the label is okay, I really like the copper cap with the Dogfish Head logo. It's simple, understated, and quite nice. (I know it's weird to comment on a cap, but this one stood out, at least for me.) This is just a 12 ounce bottle out of a six pack poured into a rudimentary (though functional) tumbler. It pours a light gold, lighter than I was expecting, with a nice crowning head. Solid head retention out of this one. Good clarity as well. Crisp citrus hop aroma dominates the nose. Initial taste is surprising. I know this is an IPA but it's got a higher level of bitterness that I was anticipating, which isn't a bad thing. Mouthfeel on this is smooth, almost slick. It can just catch you off guard if you aren't expecting it. Taste is very much hop-forward. Dogfish Head likes to say that this is an East Coast IPA but I don't know if I agree. It certainly has west-coast leanings, both with the hop profile and bitterness levels. This thing is like a tidal wave. Hops crash into your taste buds, with waves of pine, citrus and grapefruit hitting first. As the tide of hops recedes, solid biscuity and light caramel malt sweetness finishes things up. As IPAs go, this is somewhere above ordinary, bordering on the extraordinary. If I had reliable access to this beer I'd probably pick it up all the time as my IPA of choice. Very nice offering and a steady example of the American IPA style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,whisperjet,4.04,"a: Pours straw colored and clear. About an inch of head that fades fairly quickly and leaves sticky lace. A lot of visible carbonation.  s: Fruity and spicy, like tangelos and grapefruit. A good hoppy smell backs it up. The clean, citrusy aroma is nice and inviting.  t: Very bitter, but in a nice way. A lot of grapefruit flavor and bite which is really brought out by a nice balance of hops. Has a grassy feel on the palate but a clean, though sharp, finish.  m: Fairly thin bodied but still fills the mouth well. Has a nice amount of carbonation that brings out the flavors instead of masking them.  d: This beer is very dry on the palate and finishes very crisply. The taste associated with the bitterness may drive some people away but I am personally a fan.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,alleykatking,3.68,"Thought I already reviewed this one but guess not. Poured from 12oz bottle.  A- Pours a pale golden amber color. One finger white head shows amazing retention that sticks around the entire beer. Sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.  S- Citrus hops come bursting onto the scene that make my mouth water literally. My only problem with Dogfish Head is that they have this over the top caramel malt heavy aroma to them. This tends to over take the entire aroma for a split second before the pine ending balances it out.  T- Big bitter pine bite from the get go with this beer. There is a light citrus balance to this pine but even it get snuffed out toward the ending of the front. Big caramel bready malts in the middle of the beer. I mean this is all I can taste for a couple of seconds...it turns from a hop bomb to a malt bomb in a heartbeat. The ending of this comes back to a piney hop flavor and throws the balance back into this IPA.  M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. Lots of hops and a little bit of malt left on the palate. The aftertaste is alcohol, bready malts (heavy), and light pine hops. The alcohol comes into play and drys the palate out (medium). This is a balanced but unbalanced beer if that makes sense. The flavor was clean tasting for the most part and crisp for sure.  D- The one thing I usually don't like about east coast IPA's is the malts that tend to be over the top. Dogfish Head sadly is one of those breweries that do it. I think that the beer itself is good and might be sessionable to the right person. Sadly, this beer is not one for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,climax,3.93,"Finally, I found a 60 Minute single on the shelf, secretly assuming that a full 4 pack would not let me down. The color was a very transparent amber, with a respectable eggshell head.  The nose had good hop complexity, potency seemed a bit lacking however, or maybe I was just expecting too much. Grapefruit, clean soap, and some grass barely edged out the sweet malt. Somewhat of a chlorine like tinge from the aroma seemed a bit out of the ordinary.  Ah the flavor is smooth, balanced, and interesting. It's not strong, but screams drinkability. Soapy grapefruit, and a nice dash of cinnamon and spice from the malt keep each other in line.  The body is on the light side of medium, with mild carbonation. It's definitely easy to drink, as I could drink it all night. But it's no heavy hitter, but I suppose that's where the 90 & 120 Minute come in....",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The DFH 60 minute pours a slightly hazy copper orange color, finger of puffy white foam, and some beautiful lacing down the glass. The aroma as would be expected is strongly of hops, specifically piny and citrus aroma. There is also the detection of caramel malts making an appearance on the nostril, but they are not necessarily in balance. The flavors of hops and malt however are in balance. During the initial sips there is a tangy bitterness on the palate that grows on the tongue the more you consume the beer. That is a bit too bitter still for my liking, but overall it is a fine drinking beer and something that is quite pleasant for an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Two fingers worth of ivory head diminishes quickly and leaves some clingy lace.  S: Floral and slightly spicy hop aroma. Some sweet carmel-like malt in the background. A little bit of black pepper. Faint citrus and pine.  T: Very flavorful. Juicy citrus balanced out by a solid malt backbone. A hint of spruce. The moderate to high bitterness compliments all of the flavors very nicely. Slight astringency and a flash of butterscotch in the finish bring the score down a bit.  M: Carbonation is well done. Medium bodied.  D: Full of flavor and easy to drink. Interesting enough to have several. This is a deceptive beer. The bitterness is not overwhelming, but it is significant enough that is will dull the palate considerably over the course of 2-3 beers.

It poured into the glass with the color of a light tea. The head was a couple centimeters, but dissipated fairly quickly but lacing continued throughout the glass..  Smell is citrus, didn't expect the smell, was delightful. Though it wasn't in your face had to change glasses to get the aroma out a bit better. The first glass I used was one of those standard pint glass that everyone puts their logo on. the second was in a snifter.  taste like the smell was fruity, hops of course, but not as much as I was craving.

Almost perfectly clear, only a touch of haziness.. Head is big and white with good retention.  S-I'm a bit congested, but even I can smell the big, beautiful earthy and herbal hops going on here. Nice citrus undertones.  T-Palate-blasting hops here. Sharp, citrus tastes as well. I'm not identifying much malt here. Maybe a tid-bit of caramel?  M-A little heavily carbonated for the style. Body is medium. The bitterness lingers for a bit afterwards. I can feel it all over my tongue.  D-Pretty low abv for the style allows one to have a few of these in an evening. The taste is pretty sharp, and a bit heavy on the carbonation will prevent this from being too sessionable.  Notes-I know this is a staple IPA, but I had forgotten how good this was.

Beautiful 1-2 inch foamy head that kept its retention throughout the session.  S: There is something about the DFH bottled beers that bothers me: I always get a very distinct melted plastic smell combined with the hops. Is this just me? The draft version (at the Alehouse a few miles away) doesn't possess this undesirable characteristic. However, bottled DFH is still better that A-Game efforts from many other breweries.  T: Citrus, dark malts (darker than it is on draft), and a nice wet floral finish.  M: No ABV detected and nice fluffy carbonation that sustains itself to the last drop.

Citrus and grapefruit hoppiness that gives way to a slightly sweet malty aftertaste. One of the best tasting beers I've had.  M - Moderately high carbonation that fits the style of the beer quite well, pulling out the tangyness of the hops.

Yet, it's quite smooth. Very good.  Mouthfeel: Has a mild body that's not too watery.  Drinkability: Very good.

10099,6108,TMoney2591,4.22,"Served in a Chicago Bears shaker pint glass.  I can't believe I haven't entered a review for this one yet. Well, now's as good a time as any, I s'pose. It pours a clear golden amber topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, mandarin oranges, honeydew, and sweet, sweet caramel. The taste is heavier on the pine, but the fruitier hoppy notes remain, joined with the aforementioned pine in a joint domination of the sweet caramel beneath. Imagine the mutants in Futurama. The body is a heavy light/very light medium, with a light carbonation and a finish that really seems like it wants to be dry. Overall, a very nice hop-forward IPA, as good this time as it has been in the past.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell- Nice strong piney hop aroma, slight citrus aroma.  Taste- Very piney hop taste that lingers on the palate, slight malt taste helps to balance the hops. Leaves you wanting another sip.  Mouthfeel- mildly carbonated, light feel in mouth and slight oil from hops left on tongue.  Drinkability- Very drinkable, makes u wanna come back over and over again and explore the diffrent subtleties of the hops and also the backround flavors.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BBP,4.19,"A- Clear gold with moderate carbonation and head. Turned into a thin film soon after.  S- Citrus and floral hops. Slightly weak sadly, but what I did smell I loved.  T- Citrus greets you right off the bat and then slight notes of pine and hop oil take over. The hops in this don't have much of a bite, but are very hard to ignore. Has some caramel taste which balances the bitterness, but I like how it stays focussed on the hops.  M- Thin and watery, but good carbonation saves it somewhat and makes it almost creamy.  D- I remember my first one of these before I was familiar with IPAs. It was so intense and I couldn't decide whether I liked all the bitterness or not, or all the bite I thought it had. Now I find myself thinking of this as being considerably smooth and easy to down. I almost wish it had more kick now like it did the first time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smells of crsip citrus hops an dslight caramel and toasted malt sweetness. Taste of caramel malt and some tostey biscuit all under a blanket of citrus and piney hops with a moderate bittering finish. Not much alcohol burn on the finish. Mouthfeel is moderat and silky. Very drinkable IPA without to much bitternes and harshness,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,zoso1967,4.33,"Bottled on 9/25/10  I'm not sure how it is that I have not gotten around to reviewing this beer yet, since it is one of my all-time favorites.  Pours a crystal clear light orange amber with a fluffy white head that has very good staying power and leaves sticky sheets of lace.  The aroma is wonderfully pungent and hoppy in this fresh example. Orange and some pine are the main players, but there is also a bit of herbal spice in there. The malt character is very biscuity, and really accentuates the citrus notes of the hops.  The flavor is everything I have come to know and love about 60 Minute. Wonderful hop flavor, yet balanced at the same time. Dank citrus zest, pine and pithy orange mix with that same herbal spice from the nose. The bouquet is well accented by a nice caramel malt sweetness that gives the beer a bit of a bready flavor. It is evident that this is a fairly bitter IPA, but it comes off as clean and not bracing.  The mouthfeel is medium and fairly smooth with a good amount of carbonation. The finish is definitely dry, but not overly so. Pine and bitter grapefruit linger on my palate after swallowing.  Super drinkable, and a legendary east coast IPA that deserves all the hype. I have to get one of these every few months, and usually end up drinking more than one. This is a great beer to quaff at cookouts, when watching a game, or even having an ugly sweater party.

Sweet like candy malt.  T: This has got a near perfect balance of hops and malt. Fruity, pineapple, citrus and pine hops. Its not so much a carmel or toffee malt backbone, its just a plain old sweeter malt taste. Finishes with a moderate grapefruit bitterness that lasts. I would love to try this fresh, it was bottled 7/28/10.  M: Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Feels thicker and creamier than it is because of all the micro carbonation bubbles.  D: Goes down easy.

In keeping with the theme of many of my recent reviews, this is one that Ive had lots of times before but have never reviewed.  A- Really nice looking. Its a really clear, pale coppery gold color. Lots of little bubbles are racing up to feed a big, white pillowy head. Lots of lacing, pretty good retention.  S- Unfortunately this doesnt smell really hop forward. Its pretty balanced. Malts are coming through easily. Bready, crackery and somewhat corny actually. Hops are mostly just flowery.  T- The taste is a bit more hop forward but nothing crazy. I wouldnt imagine this would fade out too much in only a month but who knows. More of the same crackery and bready malts and juicy citrus and floral hops. The citrus is faint and not too easy to pinpoint.  D- I remember when I first had this beer. It was way back before I found BA. I thought it was pretty aggressive and bitter. I actually had a hard time drinking it. Now it goes down super easy and isnt bitter to me at all.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

When poured it produced a thick head that subsided fairly quickly, but left enough head to give trace rings all though my drink.  The aroma is nice, but I didn't think that it was as strong as I would have expected for an IPA. It does give enough aroma to produce grassy, herbal scents with some grapefruit.  It gives a nice dry mouthfeel that's expected of an IPA.  I like it. I'd recommend it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,fragilemacabre,4.34,"Poured into a Chimay chalice.  This has pretty much everything I look for in an American IPA though it could have had more head. Still, nice lacing. A gorgeous wheaty golden color, not quite clear enough to watch TV through but still a great clarity and consistency of color. A strange scent and taste of peach that I wasn't expecting. I've had this before and never got the peach accents until this reviewing. A bit more carbonation in the mouth than I expect, but it works pretty well to balance out the strong hoppy flavors. There's a reason or ten that this is a favorite in the IPA sphere.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The taste was of slightly bitter floral hops, citrus, there is some yeast notes also.  Light bodied, smooth and sort of oily, moderate carbonation.  This was a pretty good IPA, there was good flavor and it was refreshing and pretty light making it very easy to drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,akorsak,3.68,"A pint glass at Champions during the Ravens game.  A: The IPA ia a coppery caramel color, light enough to be translucent. A white head, no more than a quarter finger came with the ale and it quickly disappeared.  S: The nose is caramel malty with a citrusy grapefruit follow-through. Even when cold, the hops wiggle through.  T: A malt-driven IPA regardless of the hop addition, this one can't shake its caramel flavors. The hops are stronger near the end, when they are finally able to make their way through the malts. The citrus isn't overwhelming, just a strong compliment to the malts.  M: The mouthfeel is more malty than not although the citrus bitterness does come on strong near the end.  D: At 6%, this is an easy beer to drink. Funny how time and experience changes things though; this beer isn't nearly as hoppy as I remember.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

S: A nice, sweet smell of hops, citrus, and some malt.  T: Tasted of hops (of course), pineapple, sweet malt, and a hint of caramel. Not exactly a groundbreaking flavor, but very well done and tasty.  M: A good amount of carbonation with a dry finish. Medium-bodied.  D: It's easy to see why this is DFH's best selling beer.

Pours out a deep gold, somewhat thin head and with decent carbonation. Looks like an average IPA to my eyes. The smell is of hops hops and more hops. I've always said, Dogfish Head uses some wild ass hops in their beers and this is no exception. (Also call me crazy, in my clean glass I got a weird wet dog smell.) Gosh, what the heck are these hops that make it taste so different, almost like some kinda tropical fruit? Not so much piney, but more pineapple! Let me tell you, it is different. And, it is good. The mouthfeel is somewhat heavy, this is a rich beer, but not too much cause it is pretty darn drinkable.

As soon as i opened the bottle the first scent that i detected was not beer, but hops. it smelled like i had a handful of fresh Cascade hops, not a beer. And then came the first sip..it even tasted exactly like hops. This is by far the hoppiest beer that i have ever had and it isnt the regular type of hoppiness. its a fresh zesty hoppiness as opposed to the regular bitter undertone that other beers have.

A bold taste to begin, mellows out with the citrus' hoppy flavour. Highly enjoyable, pleasurable aftertaste. Certainly brewed with the hops in mind, does a great job and is tops in the IPA style.  Leaves a heavy but smooth mouthfeel. This particular bottle is aged almost a year and has settled down considerably from it's fresh state.  Overall ease of consumption: high!

10099,6108,thebrood1987,5,"Smells delicious hits you with a really rich hop smell full of citrus fruits tropical fruits grapefruit and a bit of pine in the back. You can also smell the rich amount of English Barley they use. Taste is like the smell. A lot of malted barley with an amazing balance of citrus, tropical, grapefruit and some piney hops. Somewhat lighter in color than the 90 minute but that is probably because of the way the barley is roasted and the amount thrown in.  Some people say this needs more hops but that is because the balance is unreal and as Sam Calagione says the continually hopping is unique to the style and that it adds more of a hop taste and smell without being too crushingly bitter... It's still bitter though so it definitely won't disappoint hop heads.  You should really just buy it as fresh as you can and let it warm a bit then the hop bitterness comes more into play. I can't wait till I have this on tap one day to taste the difference. I'm drinking a very fresh one though bottled on 9/03/2010 so I'm reviewing it at the peak of it's freshness that you could probably get in the bottle.  All in all Dogfish Head is worth all the hype especially if you know the difference between a craft beer and a fizzy yellow beer.

A little citrus, more grassy.  The key word for this beer is balance. All the elements are in harmony, working with each other to make a beer that is both interesting for the advocate, but simple and welcoming to the average beer drinker.

Looks more like a pilsner than an IPA. A ton of carbonation coming up from all over the glass. The head stuck on here throughout. Stayed nice and creamy. Smells very grassy. This grassy/earthiness is followed by a small touch of citric hops towards the end. The strong grass is slightly off putting but as it warms it mellows and there's more citrus coming forward. As it warms more I can smell the caramel maltines coming through as well. Taste is good. Different than what I thought it'd be from the smell. There's a good hop bite up front followed by a piney bitterness that makes its appearence during the swallow. A very solid malt backbone lasts throughout the drink to balance everything nicely.

I first tried the 90 minute IPA, however its higher alcohol content and differing mouthfeel disappointed me.  Starting off with an amber colored pour and a head that lasts quite a while for an IPA, this beer shows promise. I can't find any other way to describe the smell, other than to say it smells like Earth. Good Earth. Like the rich soils of an open field just after the rain, or even that dirt and grass stain on your jeans after you trip on a root walking down a trail. It really does smell like our provider.  From an IPA drinkers point of view, it is very well balanced. Granted an IPA drinker will be leaning for a hops centered beer, this one still has the malt and smooth to oppose the hard first bite. The head lingers as a fine layer after its original dissipation, as carbonation streams from the bottom seeming to fuel this lasting layer.  The malt that balances off the hops ever so slightly is cannot even be categorized as traditional malt at all. It is difficult to describe, as it almost seems like the different species of hops used balance themselves. Very eerie.

Smells hoppy. I'll admit, hoppier beers are growing on me. I've never been a fan, but I may be turning into one. This one may be a bit too hoppy for me, and I can tell that by the smell.  Tastes okay. Too hoppy for me personally, but there's another taste in there that's alright. Still, it's a bit too bitter.  Mouthfeel isn't impressive to me. It's way too carbonated to the point where it stings the tongue.  I'll pass on this next time.

10099,6108,scottfrie,2.85,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Big thanks to HosP for letting me try this beer!  A: Pours a slightly hazy lemony-honey golden with a finger of oily bright white head that quickly receded into a soapy film and collar that left wisps of bubbly lacing down the glass. S: Notes of roasted, almost burnt, malt and lemony citrus hops. Fairly straight forward. T: Citrus and pine hops come through over a sweet caramel and roasted malt backbone. Finish is lightly bitter and the aftertaste is fruity with a hint of sweet caramel. M: Not a ton of carbonation with a sticky, viscous mouthfeel. Medium and oily body with no trace of alcohol. D: I was underwhelmed by this beer. I'm sure it's better fresh on tap (I hope). I like their 90min better but I may be comparing apples to oranges. Still very drinkable and not a bad IPA. Someday I'll give this a second look and update my score. Thanks again Mark, this is not your fault.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TheHoppiest,3.96,"Had on tap at the Boneyard in Broadview Heights. The beer was served in a chilled pint glass making it WAY to cold. Had to let it sit a few before reviewing.  The beer is a honey-gold color, with very little head likely due to an improper pour. I'd rather lose an inch of beer fluid from the glass and have a well poured beer with a proper head, than get every last drop of overchilled liquid.  Smell is non-existent at first, due to the improper pour and cold temp. A bit of warming and agitation does bring out an evergreen hop aroma.  Taste is slightly citrusy, some piney-hops, with honey malt following, ending with decent bitterness. Not much of a bite; more of a mellow IPA.  Mouthfeel is thin to medium. Not too much astringency to dry out the tongue.  A decently drinkable brew, I've always considered this to be DFH's session IPA. For a more serious and enjoyable IPA experience, I'd recommend their 90 minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,SnowGoon99,3.87,"Serving type: bottle, into a Stella Artois glass  Appearance was clear and light straw in color. Typical of an american IPA.  Initial aroma was that of pine needles with a hint of alcohol and grassiness.  Taste matched the aroma. Piney-ness was almost overwhelming. Very bitter and almost overly sharp. Could've smoothed that out a little. Body of it was awesome and perfect for style. Carbonation was right on, wouldn't change it. Wasn't really drinkable due to the bitterness. Couldn't really have more than one of these before you kill your palate.  Overall a nicely done american IPA but i would tone down the bitterness to make it more drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Does that meke sense? Very clean and natural smell.  T - very nice. Hoppy but not too overbearing. No real sting, just straight up hop sense. This could be a real ""comfort"" beer me. You know, the ""I want something tasty but not too demanding"" kinda beer. Very good for introducing friends to tastier beers as well, I assume  M - not too remarkale. Not overly carbonated in feel, a touch bitter on the back of the tongue, but not wicked by any means.  D - oh hell ya.

Excellent lacing throughout.  Smell: Floral hops and sweet citrus with a hint of toasted malt and caramel.  Taste: Sweet citrus up front then a little toasted malt in the middle followed by a blast of bitter hops at the finish. Aftertaste is bitter grapefruit and lemon rind.

10099,6108,BlueCat1,3.28,"Is Dogfish Head subcontracting their beers regionally? That might explain why this IPA, which I've enjoyed greatly in the past, is kind of mundane now. This is the second time in the past month that I've purchased a 6 pack. Both times it was disappointing. If it were one time I'd dismiss it as possibly long shelf life or ?...but when I buy 2 in the course of a month or so and neither is distintive I feel like there's either a major QC problem or simply...it's not that good!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The smell is full of pine and citrus. An above average strength of aroma, and definitely enjoyable. The taste is very similar, as it starts out with the bitter hop flavor, moves to a more malty balance and finishes dry and bitter.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with an average amount of carbonation and has a very crisp feeling.

10099,6108,Jeffo,3.75,"Picked up 6 of these at the LCBO in Waterloo.  From a bottle into a snifter.  Note: Drunk all three in order.  APPEARANCE: Pours a one finger, medium looking white head that crackles enough for me to notice. Decent retention on the head. Clear SAE amber orange in color with zero carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a thin wisp and a ring that remain until the end and leave a few dots of lace down the glass.  SMELL: Pale malts, sweet pineapple and citrus notes, as well as some floral hop aromas. Medium strength and plenty inviting for the style.  TASTE: Pale malts, pineapple sweetness and citrus flavors as well. Some spiciness through the middle and some floral hop bitterness towards the finish. Sweet melon and hop bitter aftertaste is medium in strength and lingers nicely on the palate. Tasty stuff for sure.  PALATE: Medium body and carbonation. Not quite as creamy as others in the style, but goes down smooth and finishes slightly mouth-coating.  OVERALL: This brew is in limbo between APA and IPA, meaning it could be either a stronger and impressive former or an average latter. This one tastes a little better than average for the style, but it's still not a stand out example. Oddly enough, I think this was my favorite, or at least the best example of its style, out of the three brews in the Minute series. A solid brew to have in Ontario for sure, and one that's really refreshing served cold on a hot day by the pool.

Aroma is of copious amounts of floral hops with just a hint of citrus and even a little sweet malt. Amazing flavor throughout. Balanced malt and hop bitterness/taste. Hops definitely win out in the end but the balance is appreciated. Earthy hops bitterness is appreciated, definitely and East Coast IPA (lack of citrus/resiny West Coast hops, thank goodness I am sick of them). Very crisp and balanced carbonation, with the hop bitterness much more fresh than I was anticipating, yet finishes dry.

10099,6108,StephenRich,4.52,"As far as I am concerned, if you love a good IPA, you love hops. Therefore if you are looking for a great IPA you are looking for rich, crisp, and delicious hop characteristics in your beer. An unfortunate reality is that a massive number of IPAs available today fall into the weak-fizzy-fake-IPA category. The category of India Pale Ale has become more of a marketing scheme than actual beer style amongst the world's largest brewers. Worse than that, all this false advertising has mislead and confused consumers and beer drinkers everywhere as to what and India Pale Ale really is!  So to all the mystified and misinformed beer drinkers out there, I present to you the Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA; an IPA crafted in proper fashion, as well as one of the best IPA's available, in my humble opinion.  The Dogfish Head Brewery in Delaware NY has become easily known for producing beers which live up to its slogan, ""brewing off-centered beer for off-centered people."" It really is amazingly true; a huge range of their beers are so out of this world and so unique that they alone have made a name for Dogfish Head. Their 60 minute IPA however really is their flagship, but only stands out of the crowd because of the weak environment that the commercial marketers have created - in reality, the 60 Minute IPA is a great, but pretty standard IPA. Allow me to elaborate.  The 60 Minute IPA is among the greatest examples of a true IPA that I have ever tasted. Few beers can compare to the true hop flavor that bursts out of this beer, and even fewer could match the beers food pairing abilities! One of the primary reasons for this is that is it indeed a real IPA! Not some phony, money driven, cheap IPA using cleavage and prizes to lure you into the dark side of beer.  As the name suggests, the Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA has over 60 hop additions throughout a 60 minute boil using a slew of NorthWest hops. This process has created a deliciously unique and robust IPA bursting with citrus fresh hops and floral aromas. The beer cleanses and refreshes your palate in a wave of crisp bitter hops like nothing I've ever had. The hop bite is so perfectly matched with the pale malts in the beer that it creates a beer that is both satisfying and quenching. Its ability to pair with spicy and greasy foods, or heavy cheeses and pastas is amazing.  The beer pours rustic golden orange with a lot of life building foam immediately, and eventually resting to a very frothy one inch head. It just looks exciting already; the head has a lot of staying power which seems to be due to the flurry of bubbles pouring up from the bottom of the beer. The nose is a clear indication of the hops you should expect from the beer; fresh and bold with lots of citrus, pine, a touch of malt sweetness and grapefruit peel.  I always debate with myself what temperature that this beer should be served at. As an IPA I would typically serve it at fridge temperature (between 0 to 4C, or 32 to 39F) adding to the refreshing and quenching characteristics of the beer. But because it has so much character and flavor, I really feel like you are better able to enjoy everything the beer has to offer at a warmer temp around cool (between 12 to 14C, or 54 to 57F). What it really comes down to is the scenario. If you are in front of a BBQ on a hot day, or if you just came in from putting up some dry wall, you want this beer served right out of the fridge as to best quench your palate. MMMmm. But if you are sitting down to relax with a movie, or pairing the 60 Minute IPA with a nice 5 year old white cheddar than I would have it cool as to best enjoy all the flavor and aromas that this wonderful beer can offer.  But back to the beer itself. Once the IPA hits your tongue, before the hops make their presence known, there is a quick sweet rush of pine, grapefruit and light malt. Its so refreshing but very short lived. Quickly as the beer flows across your palate you are hit (pleasantly hit that is) with a rush of hops with a very distinct crisp bitterness that leaves your mouth so fresh and satisfied. The hops show a lot of citrus, fresh pine, and floral bitter - the grapefruit and the sweetness of the malt helps balance all the bitter that is insatiably evident in this beer. I also get a touch of bread or dough on the palate which adds to a perfect mouthfeel: crisp, very wet, perfectly carbonated, but so smooth.  Right on point with the overall hop characteristics of the beer, the finish is crisp, dry, and quenching. It's perfect with food because with every sip it scrubs your palate clean, leaving you even more prepared for your next bite of that pesto pasta. It's dry and satisfying all at the same time, and seems to leave my mouth watering a bit. It's really a chef's dream, and mine! The Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA is a Game Changing Beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,Fratstar,3.95,Great color: amber with some reddish notes. I get the hoppiness and malt with the aroma and it translates nicely when sipped.

10099,6108,Bbloom1989,4.34,"Pouring this beer has been one of the most enjoyable experiences I have had with beer thus far. This beer is one of the most beautiful beer I have ever seen in a glass. Its color is somewhere between golden amber and euphoria. It has a 1 to 2 finger white head that gave off a piney citrus nose. The distinct smell of pine or oak gave this beer wonderful allure and I feel as though the hops were perfectly selected. Up to this point, hands down my favorite IPA. My first sip gave off a similar flavor to the nose. I enjoyed the flavor almost as much as I did the nose, but I do feel as though the mouth feel was a bit off from the thick nose. The wonderful hoppyness of this beer reminded me why I really love IPA's. A truly wonderful beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,xnicknj,4,"12 oz bottle with 7/13/10 bottling date  A - Golden orange color with head about one finger high. This dissipates down to a smaller film over the beer, eventually leaving some lacing around the pint glass.  S - There's plenty of warm citrus in the nose with grapefruit and orange right up front. The hops are clean and fresh, without much background noise.  T - 60 min has a clear cut hop profile, and crisp, oily citrus hops bursting with flavor. The bitterness lingers while drinking along with touches of fruit. A lightweight malt base holds this together with some sweetness, but it manages to stay out of the way of the hops.  M - Dry and delicious, as the flavors seem to stick to the inside of your mouth while drinking.  D - The alcohol content is almost perfect here, allowing this to be far more drinkable than some of the heavier IPAs around. It's definitely bitter, but still maintains a level of refreshment.  You simply can't go wrong with this beer, especially when it's fresh. A readily accessible and easy staple for the fridge.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Gimme a six-pack of this way before a fourpack of the 90.  M-Medium body.  D-Quite drinkable. Loving the grapefruit.  To me, the 60minute is much more delicious than the 90 minute and the 120 minute.

Nose is mostly fruity hop scents with a touch of caramel that suggests an underlying malt character. Taste is fairly balanced for an IPA, although there are a lot of citrus hop notes that definitely push the hops over the top of the malts. The hop character is mostly in flavor as the bitterness is tempered slightly by a solid malt backbone.

The appearance was very tempting, not too dark and looked pretty clear.  The smell seemed what I would expect from an IPA, some hops in the aroma.  The taste was very good. Of the IPA's I have tried, I definitely would buy this one again. A nice strong flavor that doesn't turn into bitterness afterwards.

Color is hazy amber to caramel.  Aroma sets itself off with flowering hops, hints of citrus, and sets the stage nicely for it's full flavor even before you put the glass to your lips.  Flavor is plentiful from the beginning as a true IPA should be: hops, citrus, earthy flavors that circles the taste-buds leaving them wanting the next sip.  Highly recommended if you love hoppy IPAs",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Citrus, pine, some funk as it warms a bit, through the hop forest you can pick up some malts in there as well.  Bright citrus hops up front but a nice malty backbone to balance it out. Lots of nice hop flavors ranging from citrus to astringent. Finishes dry and leaves some bitterness on the palate.

I like the aroma of this beer with its floral notes keeping it from being too sharp. The taste is strong and hoppy with a little bit on the astringent side, leaving me with a mouth feel like I just used Listerine. I do believe this is a very good sipping beer for sitting by the fire on a cool spring/autumn/winter evening. Not for a warm and humid day in midsummer. I think this would also compliment a steak very well.

The aroma was bold. The hop smell came out of the bottle right after I poured it. The beer is a burnt orange with same haze making it impossible to see thru. Bitter. A good solid hoppy bitter which left a slight but pleasant bitter aftertaste. The hops are fairly strong but this would be a nice starting beer for some new to an IPA.

S - A nice, pungent pine hop aroma with strong grapefruit character. There is some rich, toasty malt in the background with just a hint of caramel.  T - Bitter, pine hops up front with dry toasty malt. Some grapefruit and lemon in the middle with lightly acidic grain character. Finishes with more pine hops and dry, slightly burnt, toast malt and moderate bitterness.  M - Medium body, moderate carbonation, and a dry finish.  D - This is a classic IPA. The aroma is excellent and it is easily the best aspect of the beer. The flavor is nice as well but the malt, while dry, gets cloying from the singed toast notes. This is one of those beers that has been so ubiquitous for so long that I tend to take it for granted.

Formed an egg shell two-finger head that receded quickly with nice belgian lace.  The aroma is very earthy, like the minerals that poke through in hard water...tough to describe. There is also a sweet bouquet that comes through in the back.  Very light malt in the front, smooth through the middle (well balanced) and then a great hop kick with a long dry aftertaste.  Well carbonated with different floral and citrus notes throughout.  Would absolutely have another. Very good beer...lives up to its reputation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

A - Golden color, little head, maybe a half inch at best. Lacing dissipates quickly.  S - Lots of hops, spicy, with a clear citrus smell - grapefruit, a little orange as well.  T - Initially bitter, as a good IPA should be, but then the complexity of the flavor comes through. This is what I noticed when I first tasted this beer months ago. As someone who grew up on Bud Light and whatever was on sale, the complexity of an IPA was totally foreign to me. With the DFH 60, the longer you wait between sips, the more subtle flavors you taste, making you want to pour another when the glass is empty.  M - Well-carbonated, not too light.  D - Perfect for hot summer days by the pool. I could easily have a few of these in the course of an afternoon.  I know there are better IPAs, but there's a soft spot for me for DFH 60, as my introduction to good beer.

The taste has a bit of malt extract flavor but is otherwise pleasing. It's fairly dry which is a nice change of pace for DFH. Not quite enough bitter bite in the finish. It could use a bit more hops, though they're certainly present and I'm probably being a bit of an IPA snob by saying that. Mouth feel is unobjectionable. Nice IPA.

A fresh burst of orange and grapefruit immediately show up in the nose with a more floral tone in the middle, and lightly spicy in the back.  Taste starts off with notes of orange and lemon upfront, floral and spicy hops come in about midway through. The citric side shows a lot more grapefruit toward the end than it does initially, with just a touch of caramel in the finish.  Light to medium body with medium carbonation. This is basically the classic IPA in my book. While the 90 and 120 Minutes and countless other IPAs are intentionally overhopped, DFH 60 is straight and simple by comparison, yet still has enough complexities to amuse and be extremely enjoyable.

Aromas of piney hops, with a little bit of malt in the background. Flavor is concentrated; lots of malty sweetness on the finish, quickly followed by fairly intense hoppy bitterness.

Smell: Has a very strong floral/grassy smell with a hint of citric hops, but the floral smell is more prominent.  Taste: The first thing that pops into my head is coffee when I taste this, except I don't do a whole lot of coffee drinking to base it off of. It also taste as it smells, meaning there is a grassy taste to it with a hint of citrus, but overall its a balanced taste.  Mouth feel: Not too thin and not too thick so to speak, very balanced and goes down easy.  Drink ability: One of the more drinkable IPA's I've tasted. It's less on the bitter side meaning my taste buds won't get sick of it easily. Would be able to go through a six pack without wanting to taste something else.

S: Mildly estery with hints of floral citric hop, cookie like malt and a faded buttery yeast combo.  T&M: Lots of fresh hop oil flavour, very juicy with citric and bitter herbal tones. Solid maltiness holds up to the hops well with a dough toasted grain mix. Touch of nutty yeast with a slight warmth from estery alcohol. Finish semi-dry with a long lingering bitter finish from the hops.  Notes: An idea IPA to have around, very drinkable and very flavourful.

Malts are also there, lending a light caramel and bread-like aroma.  Taste has that ""juicy"" component at first. I get lemon, grapefruit and definitely orange. At about mid-pallete, flowery hops and caramel malt kick in and work to dial back some of the fruit. It finishes with toast bread, citrus fruit rind and floral hops.

T- Strong and varied hops character, intense but not at all overpowering. Very delicate citrus taste, with a noticeable, warm caramel flavor. There's also something coming off grassy or woodsy that I can't put my finger on exactly. The malts have a candy-like quality to their sweetness, noticeable but restrained and very nice. The caramel flavor grows as it warms.  M- Nice and creamy, the hops leave a bit of a resin, but nothing that lingers too long.

10099,6108,tchenery,4.62,"Beer is very clear, a nice yellow color. High carbonation from th elooks of it. Nice retaining head.  It has excellent grapefruit and zest aromas. Very heavy American west coast hop smells. It tastes very smooth and soft. There is a nice hop fruit flavor to it, again of grapefruit and other tropical fruits. It has a slight malt middle, very straightforward and then a nice dry bitter finish.  Excellent mouthfeel. Excellent drinkability. It's no wonder this is looked at as an example for others to compare.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TexIndy,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on date of 5/14/10 lasered onto the neck. It was a clear golden color with good amount of carb streams. It had an average sized white head that settled into a good collar and thin central film. Moderate slow sliding lace with very little sticking.  The aroma was good and hoppy and featured pine, citrus and grass. Bitter with some malt in the back. The taste was mild bitter with pine out front with the citrus and grass in the next tier. Sweet malt to mellow the bitter. This is a good bitter hops beer with a good balance. Not quite session for me as I still prefer the less bitter AIPA's but this one is quite good and growing on me. Medium mouthfeel with plenty of carb. Mildly bitter after-taste.  Overall, a really good moderately bitter AIPA . Highly recommend. Avail here in TX. Rotation - good BHT so will make the hops rotation for sure [O;Y;BHT]",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,thagr81us,3.98,"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours a nice golden copper with a one-finger white head. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of mild hops and malt. The flavor is of roasty hops, with a malt aftertaste with just a hint of fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very smooth IPA without the 'in your face' flavors. This makes it quite drinkable and refreshing. I will be buying more of this in the near future.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

S - Subtle pine-like notes.  T - Mild bitterness. A little pine-like flavor. Bitterness sticks around but is not overpowering. A little sweetness in the finish.  M - Very smooth IPA. Almost creamy.  D - Very drinkable IPA with a good balance of flavor.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Bouleboubier,4.8,"Had this particular draft during a Dogfish Head feature at Standard Tap during Philly Beer Week.  Compared to the bottle version, which has a fairly clean and crisp look, this poured a little cloudier. Brassy baguette crust hue. Thick, creamy, whipped texture to the head. Sticky lacing from top to bottom.  Reeks of fresh, soft, doughy bread and mountainy pine. Oh man.  The bread factor in the flavor is kickin'. Heard the expression before but, more than any other beer I've had, this tastes like liquid bread - once again, of the French/Italian roll variety. That, combined with what I feel is a quite unique hop character - one that I could best describe as the taste in your mouth after smoking a magical hop blunt - forms an intoxicating, organic blend - there is substance - this is food.  Medium-full bodied, fuzzy hop zing, and subtle dry finish.  Probably my favorite American IPA. Perhaps the only IPA I could session with reckless abandon. Haven't had another like it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,damndirtyape,3.98,"Single bottle poured into a shaker pint glass. Bottled on 04/19/10  Appearance: Clear orange yellow with lots of carbonation coming up through the beer. Very nice bone white head with lots of lacing all over the glass. Very pleasant to look at.  Smell: When cold, the smell is sweet mangoes, but as it warms up, there is more of a grassy hop smell along with a lot of grapefruit.  Taste: Hoppy, but balanced with malt. Up front the flavors are a mix of citrus and malt, and then there is a bitter finish that lingers on the palate for awhile.  Mouthfeel: Crisp carbonation on the tongue, but it leaves fast. Not watery - but the liquid is not thick or lingering...seems silly to call it ""liquidy"" and yet it is. Above average.  Drinkability: Quite nice - seems like this would go very well with a meal but in this case (drinking it alone) I'm very happy with it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,mithrascruor,4.01,"12 oz. bottle poured into a mug.  Appearance: Pours a pale golden copper color. It seems slightly hazy, but it could just be all the tiny carbonation visible. Giant lovely slightly off-white head is pretty creamy and has great retention. Excellent lacing too.  Smell: I'm having trouble getting much of an aroma off of this. It seems like a bit of some spicy & slightly bitter hops, and some caramel.  Taste: Nicely balanced flavor of malts and hop bitterness. A bit of caramel in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Light- to medium-bodied and rather creamy. Mild carbonation. It almost has a nitro feel to it.  Drinkability: Very easy to drink IPA.  An enjoyable IPA that goes down smooth. Slightly on the sweet side for an IPA, and the almost nitro-feel is a bit odd, but still a really nice solid IPA. I'd probably opt for something else in the future (90 Minute is just as easy to find), but still a good one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Mostly citrus and floral hops in the taste as well. The bready malt is delicate but makes it's presence known. It has about the perfect amount of bitterness yet keeps a good balance.  The body is lighter than average and crisp. It has a light puckering effect with a dry finish.  This is such a classic IPA, I can't believe I had never reviewed it.

Smells pretty good with strong citrus hops and a little biscuit aroma from the malts. Hop flavour is quite fresh and abundant. A nice mix of grapefruit and a more subtle earthy flavour. Nice balance of bready malts makes it very drinkable. Has a nice mouthfeel to it. Fluid on the tongue with a dry and bitter finish.

10099,6108,brownbeer,3.91,"Pale golden color, with sensational clarity and head retention. Bready malts up front in the nose, unusually so for an IPA.

Nose is floral, a mild hop smell of grapefruit, resin and grass. Mouthfeel is light to medium with carbonation evident. Taste is, at first, some citrus bitterness, then some malt sweetness kicks in - caramel, brown sugar, bread. Finish is some mild leafy bitterness.

10099,6108,GregoryVII,4.42,"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. It has a nice, deep golden color, with a solid, rocky, foaming head. The aroma is strong hops, pine and zest from the northwest varities that are used, with interlaced citrus notes (some say oranges, I think lemon). It has a firm and warming mouthfeel. The flavor profile on this I.P.A. is admirable due to its balance. There is a solid malt background here to compliment the hops. On the other end the warrior hops they use give it a nice, powerful bitterness that at the same time is so clean it's amazing. The amarillo and whatever their ""mystery"" hop is remind me of cascade on steroids. There is pine zest a plenty to take your palate on tree climb. Dogfish Head describes this as a ""sessionable"" I.P.A., which brings a smile to my face.

After the Stone Ruination IPA this seemed a bit watery and weak, my fault for the other I ordered them I suppose.  Hops, like all US IPA's this tries to outhop the next brewery, it failed though.  Pleasant mix of hops for aroma and bitterness, but laked the umph I'd just had with the Stones beer.  Can I call it an average US IPA?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Nose is also superb: cereal malts, caramel, cream or butter, pine, and herbal hops.  One of the best IPAs I've had to date. Smooth, yet complex. The hop bitterness is kept well in check by a bready malt character, with a touch of caramel for sweetness. A lasting, bitter finish. Great stuff.  Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, slightly thin, decent carbonation.  I can't believe I've taken so long to review this brew... I can probably only handle a bottle or two in a setting, so its sessionability is pretty low, but as a sipper, it's fantastic.

S: The aroma is not as big as I prefer, but what's there is pretty decent. Fresh hops with a good malt backbone.  T: The first thing I noticed was that this beer was fresh. It's extremely important to drink IPA beers fresh, especially if reviewing. Next, this beer is considerably better on draft than in a bottle. That being said, 60 minute IPA was much tastier than I expected or remembered. In particular, the balance of hops and malts was very well done.  M: Clean, with crisp carbonation and a bitter finish.

Reduces to a ring and wispy cap and doesn't really leave much lace aside from what's left of the original head.  Aroma is citrus, floral hops, some grass and a little pine, some light bready malt. Inviting, but only moderately strong aroma.  Flavor is quite juicy and hoppy with good bitterness, citrusy, particularly oranges, some earth, grass, a bit of malt sweetness in the middle.

10099,6108,KickInTheChalice,4.12,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Dark, slightly cloudy golden color. A modest off-white head forms, retaining small islands on the top of the beer throughout. Slight sticky lace.  Smell: Pine hops is the first thing I notice, but there is a strong sweetness here as well. Toffee malt, citrus hops, and a resiny aroma all round out the nose.  Taste: Tingly, fresh, and juicy. A sweet and a biscuity malt are both present, almost fighting against the impending hops. Don't worry, the hops win. A touch of spice before citric hops lead the hop profile. A mild alcohol flavor sneaks through along with a resiny pine hoppiness. Leaves a light bitter, oily aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Great creamy feel, backed by strong carbonation. It feels great sitting in my mouth, and while I enjoy the smooth creaminess, the carbonation goes about lifting any oils off my tongue. Some hop oiliness, but not too extreme.  Drinkability: Not a truly exceptional taste, but the smooth and creamy mouthfeel complements the taste so well, vastly increasing the drinkability.

Appearance: Brilliantly clear golden amber beer with some attractive pillows of foam sitting atop it. Head stays pretty firm at three millimeters, sudsy spots of lace around the edges. Odor: Bread crust in the background, grapefruit and apricot hop aroma in the forefront, very pleasant, soft hop aroma. Consistency: Light end of medium bodied, moderate, but prickly carbonation. Taste: Full backdrop of crusty dark bread, a little bit of yeast fruitiness to back it up. Hop flavors mirror the aroma, grapefruit and apricot with hints of pine sap bitterness in the mix. Malt sweetness flows low, balanced, but the bready flavors stay strong into the clean finish, mixing well with the lingering grassy hop flavor on the tongue.

10099,6108,Naugros,3.68,"NOTE: I am tasting this one just before 90-Minute and comparing the two for my own sake.  Amber to light orange in color with a head that immediately rises and then sinks back to a frothy covering about 1/4"" thick. Lace sticks to the side in a display that speaks to the quality control of the brewing process.  The smell of hops is intense with citrusy esters. There is a slightly sweet smell, but I don't think it's the malt coming through. I'll be surprised if I taste any malt in this beer.  The taste shoots straight to the back of your throat with a grapefruit assault that lingers in a pithy aftertaste on the palate. This does subside a little as you continue to drink. I do detect a wee bit of the caramel malt in the middle of the tongue, so I was wrong there. I do not find the flavors to be well-balanced and the intent of this beer seems to be to make a hop head orgasm.  I know IPAs are supposed to be highly hopped, but it is possible to balance them and eliminate overly assertive aftertastes. Weyerbacher does it with their Simcoe DIPA, Green Flash manages it as does Lake Placid IPA. Dogfish Head does not do so here and that may never have been their intent. All I know is that the overly bitter feel in my mouth is not to my liking.  A pint that I will have difficulty finishing. I've had better IPAs and I have to admit that I am disappointed as I've heard great things about this IPA and expect better from DFH.

Sight: Deeper yellow in color than that of an every day lager perhaps a bit orange.  Scent: Very large amounts of citrus on the nose, particularly grapefruit as well as soap and possibly fresh cut grass or some form of vegetation.  Taste: Not as bitter as a few other IPA's I have had before, like the nose suggests the flavor offers citrusy fruit flavors such as Grapefruit, lemon/lime, Soap, Grass, and rice.  Feel: Very silky oily even which is cut only by the bitterness on the tongue.

Very very balanced and crispy hops at the end.  M - So smooth and so well balanced. Really the highlight of this beer. Bready and chewy - pretty full bodied for an IPA. Carbonation is perfect and complementary.  D - Very drinkable overall but it is pretty filling. Even though it is only 6% ABV, I don't know if I'd session with it. Very well-hopped.

Taste: Lives up to the expectations set by the smell. This is a very pleasant IPA, with the bitterness and maltiness in perfect balance. It's really not that bitter at all, actually, and I'd normally not like that in an IPA, but hell, I like this as it is.  Mouthfeel: Good, not too watery.  Drinkability: This is an IPA with only 6% ABV? And it tastes good? Sounds like a session beer to me!

The head becomes slightly rocky as dimpled impressions form. Very good retention and finally recedes into a film that lasts forever. The body is remarkably clear, orange-amber in color. Continental sized patches of lace adorn the glass.  S & T: Heavily malted for the style, even still as I would liken the 60 Minute IPA to an English style more than American. Caramel, cookie, honey wheat bread, toffee and nuts, all heavily toasted. Above average hop content of pine and resin. There is a faint hint of honey, if honey existed in sugar-free form. Suggestions of fresh roasted peanuts come to mind.  M: Medium full bodied mouthfeel, especially for an IPA. Creamy and mouthcoating. An appropriate level of carbonation provides a moderate crispness to the semi bitter finish. Lightly sweet.  D: Excellent take on the American IPA.

Recedes to a white cap that sticks around for the entire beer. Small pockets of carbonation give the beer a lively appeal.  Smell - Piney hops, white grapes, slightly citrusy, and some overall sweetness to backup the piney/citrusy hop notes.  Taste - Hops attack up front before leading into some malty sweetness before leading back into the piney hops. Nice lingering bitterness. A real solid IPA flavor profile that matches the aroma.  Mouth Feel - Medium body that coats the mouth in slightly prickly, yet smooth, carbonation and hoppy goodness. Great feel.  Drinkability - A very sessionable IPA with a hop-heavy flavor profile (without being a hop bomb) that still retains some balance.

T- Floral hops in the beginning balancing well with a lovely sweet barley sugar sweet quality. Hops linger in background. Alcohol well hidden. Basil note coming through again in the finish as the beer warms  M- Light, medium carbonation.  D- A nicely hopped refreshing IPA with a delicate malt note to even out the bitter quality.

10099,6108,eat,4,"This beer is almost-clear and light-amber in colour. A patchy, bubbly off-white covering of head sticks around, leaving some decent lacing behind.  Smells of grapefruit juice, pineapple, light pine and grass with some caramel to balance it out. Textbook IPA scent.  Tastes like lots of hops, though this IPA is better balanced than many other American versions of the style. A citrusy (grapefruit, lemon) and earthy hop profile is balanced out with enough sweet malt, neither of which overwhelm. There's a peppery element thrown in as well. You can tell there's alcohol in there but it blends in well with everything else.  Nice feel for an IPA: slightly-viscous medium body and moderate carbonation, sparkling a little on the tongue while accentuating the hops.  This is a really solid IPA, one I could drink regularly and one I'm glad the LCBO has the sense to stock (though it almost seems like that might have been an accident amongst so many mediocre offerings). I could session this if I was having a hops craving, otherwise a couple would go down just fine.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Head dissipates slowly throughout and coats glass with a filmy layer of suds.  S - Pine, citrus, yeast. In short, an IPA smell.  T - The hops and an orange-lemon flavor are forward in the profile. Tree nuts, malty caramel, and coriander (?) round out the flavor, with an ever-so-slight alcohol burn and more piney hops in the finish.  M - The carbonation makes this a complex, but accessible, mouthfeel. A nice medium-body makes this go down very easily for an IPA.  D - Easy to drink, crisp and somewhat tart.

Lofty white head with decent retention and lacing.  Smell - Instantaneous grapefruit. Hard to get past it, but once broken there is a slight grassy/floral hops.  Taste - Why hello again, Mr. Grapefruit. Starts off slightly bitter, with the ever present hops flavor taking over, but fairly smooth. This is overtaken after the swallow with a sweet and mouth puckering grapefruit/citrus flavor. Not too much depth but a nice balance from bitter to tart.  Mouthfeel - Not smooth like a stout, but overall not too bad. There is some smoothness, but also a slight bite from the carbonation. Good for the warm summer. Finishes a little dry.  Drinkability - Definitely there, I finished my first two without hesitation or complication, and it's a rainy, cool evening. Cannot imagine how many I can drink when it's hot out.  This is easily becoming my favorite summer beer, I hope to try the 90 Minute IPA next, and see how it holds up against this lovely grapefruit-laden IPA here.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Grapefruit and lemonade. Looks good  T- Doesn't really taste like amarillo hops though. More bitter and soapy. Alcohol is easy to find. Piney bite. Something a bit dirty, like the water used was weird. This is really good beer but I do feel a bit let down.  M-Full. Not dry or sweet. Medium soft carbonation.  D-Very high.

10099,6108,ThePortlander,4,"Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a DFH snifter (on other occasions a shaped pint).  It appears a slightly cloudy orange-gold color, with a decently frothy head. The retention and lacing are both decent as well.  The smell is as hop-heavy as I was expecting (it is continuously hopped), but there is a decent malt sweetness. There's not as much intricacy as I was hoping for, though I don't mind the smell of hops either.  The taste and mouthfeel both leave a little to be desired, but provide a unique hop palate nonetheless. If you're looking for traditional IPA hop flavor (citrus, resin, etc.), however, you may not find what you're looking for here: this like hop oil. That said, there are hints of citrus and a wonderful bitter finish as it dries. The malt works well against the hops, and the yeast choice is spot on for this hop bill.  It's not bad for a hefty hop fix, but drinkability depends on how much I'm craving hops, and I wasn't feeling it today. Overall, it's still fairly balanced, but certainly provides that strong hop flavor when you want it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell - Heavy malts on the forefront, light floral and hop scents. Nothing really stands out here to be honest.  Taste - Malt in the initial sip which is balanced out by some light, semi-bitter grapefruit and hop flavors. Honestly, not bad. I was expecting a bit more of a 90 min style here (but not as in your face) but it actually is better than I thought.

I will immediately come out and say I can only hope the 90 or 120 are much less disappointing.  While there was a great amount of lacing, 60 Minute pours a fairly average shade for an IPA.  Smell was okay, but not as hoppy as I expected. Instead it was matched if not overpowered by the orange citrus smell. Centennial and Noble hops come to mind, though I'm trying to learn how to distinguish.  Taste again, was pretty good. All the aforementioned smells appear here, but it just seems like a fairly weak IPA overall.  Mouthfeel was obviously disappointing. Felt thin and watery....what the hell happened here?

10099,6108,irishking1977,4.25,"A: Clear golden/amber/copper color with little head and mild lacing. Decent looking beer, despite the amount of rave reviews and mass attention this one gets. (So far the 90 minute IPA is one of my top 3 IPA's including Stone's Ruination and Hop Devil)  S: Citrus, yeast and an abundance of hops mild sweet caramel and pine. Hops are clearly less noticeable as they are in 90 minute or Ruination, but those are more robust IPA's. In addition, I think they are actually IDIPAs.  T: I wasn't at all disappointed with 90 minute, and the same goes for this one. Not as intense as 90 min, but still full of hoppy, malty flavor. Having a good malt background is essential to a good hoppy beer, and this one has it in spades. Moderate to intense hops bitterness lingers on the palate for quite some time, but is never overwhelming. An excellent example of what a good beer can truly be.  M: Above average carbonation, and a prickly, crisp hoppy sensation on the palate. Mildly oily and creamy, but oily moreso. To me, the two most important aspects of a beer, (taste and mouthfeel) are represented very well in this beer.  D: Very good drinkability, but they said that too much of a good thing, can be a bad thing. I doubt they were referring to this beer, though. Very tasty, very refreshing, just a pleasure to the palate.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,HeroicDoses,4.35,"Poured a muted copper from a bottle into standard pint glass. Has a thin hearty head with extensive lacing. Very well rounded IPA. The hops are pronounced, but not at the expense of subtlety. This results in an agreeable flavor that avoids the trap of overstayed aftertastes that I feel too many IPA's have. Drinkability is well above average, and the body is a lot lighter than you'd expect from an IPA. Another thing it does well is avoid the extra stickyness (in the finish) that you get from an IPA. Basically this beer is everything I like about an IPA, with all the stuff I normally don't like in an IPA taken out. Really enjoyed it.

Excellent color and depth to the beer. 2 fingers of fluffy white head with excellent retention (well over 5 minutes). Seems to be a fair amount of carbonation rising in the glass which replenishes the head as it recedes.  S. Heavy hop smell, citrus, and earthy pine smell.  T. Excellent depth and retention of flavors on the tongue. Earthy, citrus, salty, sweet, nuts, and of course hops. The hop flavor isn't as strong as some ipa's but it has staying power with a long dry and pleasantly bitter aftertaste.  M.

D- Great session beer, great beer to have on hand.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,PartyBear,3.73,"Pours an amber body with lots of carbonation and a foamy white head. Lots of c-hops as expected, grapefruit and pine. There is a light buttery cake undertone in the aroma. Tons of bitterness from the hops and a subtle caramel base. Not as balanced as the 90 minutes, but still very drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,WhiteOak,4.57,"A- Amber, with a moderate white head.  S- The aroma is dominated by bright, fresh, citrusy hops. Very alluring.  T- Rich, nutty maltiness and grapefruit hops share the stage. The finish of hops bitterness lingers on.  M, D- The 60 Minute hits the palate with enough structure to be substantial, but not so much as to be overbearing; this beer is refreshing and satisfying at the same time. I think this is a true case of exceptional drinkability when enjoyed from the tap, where every sip tempts you to have another. Great stuff!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ToasterChef,4.6,"Reviewed from my notes. The beer is golden orange with streams of carbonation rising. It's very clear in appearance. There is a thin head made of white foam and soap bubbles sitting on top. There is a great fresh hop aroma with some bitter hop oils mixed in as well. It's very appealing. The taste has sweet hops up front, followed by that great DFH hop bitterness. The aftertaste is also bitter, but not too strong. This is an ideal IPA. It has a light to medium body with good levels of carbonation and some mouth coating. It feels above average, but not exceptional. I find this beer to be so drinkable. It's a great go-to hoppy beer that is easily accessible. It seems criminal I don't have a case in my cellar for easy access.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,SkeeterHawk,4.22,"Appearance: Pours almost completely clear yellow/orange/gold color with a small head of white bubbles that fell pretty quickly back into the beer.  Aroma: I initially got lots of citrusy hops, but they actually had some balance with the malt. The malt is somewhat sweet with a bit of honey noticeable.  Taste: The flavor is pretty much in line with the aroma in that is is very hoppy with some honey malts coming out. There are some toasty notes in the flavor that I didn't pick up in the aroma. The overall balance is hoppy with a medium body and slightly light carbonation. The finish is mildly toward the hops, but the beer doesn't finish chalky.  Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I have not reviewed it because I guess I was afraid that it would be so bitter that it would be hard to drink. It actually has some malt balance, while being different from the 90Min IPA. I am pretty pleased with this beer overall though I am not a hop-head. I would drink it again...so there you go.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,RickS95,3.94,"Clear, straw-colored with a thin white head...not really my thing.  Very nice smell of floral citrusy hops with a touch of pepper.  Has a woody, citrusy taste.  The mouthfeel is complex. The hops hit you like a hammer before gradually giving way to the mildness of the citrus.  The finish is strong with the bitter notes coming thru.  Nice lacing in the glass. This is an all-around good beer; looking forward to another.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The taste was excellent, it was 'full body' and had some bitterness but finished very smooth.  I typically don't drink IPAs, but after reading other reviews about this beer, I gave it a try and really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Kylito87,3.84,My first Dogfish Head product. Thanks goes to Arista Foods. Heres we goes.  Appearance- Poured into my new tulip. Golden orange with a fizzy white head that falls quickly into a foamy puddle on top. Very minimal lacing not a whole lot but it is there.  Smell- Very floral and earthy. Some citrus hop essence with a slight malt graininess in the background.  Taste- Nice hop punch up front followed by the nice floral and citrus tones. Not as bitter as I thought it would be but it makes up for it by having a nice balance. There are some biscuity characters in the finish.  Mouthfeel- Crisp and light carbonation dance across the pallete nicely. Perfect body it has a good smooth feel as well.  Drinkability- This is one of my favorite IPAs at the moment. It goes down well but not chugable which means it is perfect. I like beers that you can sip and enjoy. The alcohol doesn't seem to be an issue with this beer. All in all a good beer worthy of try. I look forward to trying some of DFHs other offerings.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

S - Good floral character in the smell, you get it as soon as you open the bottle  T - Well balanced. DFH 60 has a nice hop bite (not over the top), and yet the citrus smell backs off in the taste, more of a piney flavor with the fruit in the back. Even more surprising is the malt flavor in the back, it comes on at the end and adds a richness to balance the hops.  M - Good solid mouthfeel to this beer  D - I can sit back with these all afternoon.

10099,6108,Spider889,4.34,"Excellent IPA for the beginner and connoisseur alike. Very drinkable, light and flowery. Amazingly complex hop smell and flavor without being over-powering or too bitter. Light in color, and easy going at a mere 6% abv (which is one of the lowest Dogfish Head offers).  The 60 minute can easily be found at most grocery stores in Ohio where I live and is quickly becoming a permanent handle offered at many of the better bars around the state. The biggest downside is the seemingly steep price (often 9.99 for a six pack).  Just as good on tap or out of the bottle, even had it at the brewpub in DE. This is always a great beer for me but I highly prefer the 90 minute and the prized Burton Baton over the 60 min.  Side note: all of the regular Dogfish Head IPAs (60, 90, 120 minute) are brewed using a unique continual hopping process during a boil that lasts for as long as each beer's name implies. This provides a very unique and instantly recognizable hop flavor to the Dogfish beers. This method is actually patented by the brewery creating a flavor that no other brewery can directly match. I could also include the 75 minute and Burton Baton though both are blends that include some of the aforementioned beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Can't really place what I'm getting, though it smells a little flowery.  T- I'm getting a ton of orange peel, various other flowery hops. Its very complex tasting...theres a lot here that I just cannot put my finger (well, tongue in this case) on.  M- Its really light and pleasant. Not overly bitter or sweet...just right.  D- This is pretty great. I've always heard that DFH has made a great IPA, and I'm a fullblown believer now.

However, the color is a gorgeous amber. Looks very appetizing.  Took a big whiff. Hoppy, for sure. Citrusy, yep. Not quite as biting as I'd expected or hoped.  The first sip. Felt good in my mouth. Reminded me at first of an English Pale Ale, but after the swallow, the malt kicked in. Caramel; sweet. Made me want another sip almost instantly.  Great stuff. This is my first experience with Dogfish Head, believe it or not. I plan on starting my climb up the ladder, from 60 to 75 to 90 to 120.

10099,6108,PDXHops,2.91,"12 oz bottle, poured into a Duvel tulip.  Pours a very pale see-thru amber with a tornado of visual carbonation up the middle of the glass. A finger and a half of puffy off-white head reduces quickly to a skim, but still manages to leave some decent lacing.  Smells of rich toasted and lightly sweet malts, a little nutty, a little earthy. Hops?  OK, I guess there's some hops in here after all. A decent amount of piney bitterness up front, but it oddly disappears midswallow, yielding to a lingering toasted nuttiness and a somewhat earthy flavor. A bit of lingering booziness, even at this modest ABV. The substantial maltiness is rather dry and biscuity. Could use a serious injection of lupulin.  Overall impression: Old bottle or just not to my taste? I suppose I'll try it again to make sure it wasn't the former, but this was pretty disappointing to me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell is definitely filled with a certain citric like bitterness as one would expect a very full flavored IPA to be.  First taste is very crisp and clean. Notes of honey and herbs can be felt throughout the flavor and body.  Overall, the mouthfeel is very satisfying. In all honesty, it's what one should expect out of an IPA, yet in most cases is never met. This is the beer that standards should be met to.  For price and availability, I agree whole heartedly that this is one of the best models of efficiency in the beer world that there is.

This IPA won't hit you over the head with hop bitterness, flavor, or aroma and in fact I think they almost have trouble standing up to the great malt flavors.

T: The taste starts with a sharp bitterness that fades into some mild citrus, almost English-like, hops. Not as piney as other IPAs, but not as hoppy in general as all the IPAs from the Midwest and West coast. Bitterness is overly balanced by a super malty sweetness. IBUs are relatively low for the style. This IPA is sort of boring, there isn't much more going on than what a good pale ale can pull off.  M: Relatively creamy and well carbonated. Not quite as creamy as the bottle conditioned IPAs.  D: Relatively easy to drink but not as refreshing as I would of hoped.

Hazelnut, dried apricot and dark toast malts with deep resin, citrus oil and earth hops. Sticky sweet finish. Piney linger. Chewy, soft, medium to full body, no burn.  Heavy! Puts the ""ale"" in IPA.

Mouthfeel is a bit thin but helps but the highlight of the beer which is drinkability.

Two months in the bottle aromatics are earthy, minty, slightly grapefruity hops with a yeasty ringwood nose.  Some earthy lightly lemon hops upfront in the flavor and a bold crisp malt, very bread dough slightly sweet sugar cookie, very clean and crisp. A little bit of pine and oak in the finish.  Hop bitterness is right on, lighter side of medium body, very slight alcohol warming, mostly accentuated from the bitterness.

10099,6108,jameswaldo,3.92,"Poured a clearer than expected fine bubbling champaigne fizzing bottle into pint shaker glass to fit the good firm off-white head. Good lace from long-lasting foam. Very delish hop smell wide and blossomy. Taste of hops all around just barely noticeable light malt, with good thoroughly encompassing solid mouthfeel hanging bitter on tongue for quite a while after each swallow. Maybe it's just in my mind, left from what I've read about the continuous hopping method in this brew, but I'm getting tongue news that hops are of all sorts except citrus, and all giving their every sort of taste to this excellent ale. The hop bitterness I love is in this beer solid, elegant, thorough, tho lacking the sharper more acid edge some hop blossoms can contribute. I'd drink this all the time if it cost $3 less per six-pack. Even at its current price, I'm honored when I feel rich enough to get it on my IPA rack in kitchen fridge.  I reviewed this more than ten years ago, when I'd never drink beer from a can. In the past decade I've had this fine Dogfish ale now and then, and always much enjoyed it. This evening I tried a 19.2 ounce tall skinny can for the first time, poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Did not smell the hops complexity this time, just maybe Citra? Hops weren't as bitter, and the malt hardly noticeable. This ale was canned on 6/18/20, so its less than a month old but not as tasty as I usually find it. The pizza I ate it with was extremely tasty, so it's not my tongue gone wrong. Maybe I need to stick to bottles?

10099,6108,anneseg,3.97,I was surprised given the experimental and forward thinking nature of Dogfish Head that I gravitated toward the 60 Minute when looking for what in my mind has become a classic IPA.  The pour was decent but the head retention was definitely lacking. There was almost nothing of the head left by the time I put the glass down after pouring.  The citrusy smell of hops was perhaps the best part of the experience. The bitterness was nicely balance and was not over powering.

A: The pour is a clear light amber color with a thin white head which dissipates to a thin layer but leaves some nice sticky lacing.  S: The nose is mildly hoppy with some pine and grapefruit. There's quite a bit of toasty, bready malt in the background as well.  T: The flavor is more reminiscent of a pale ale than an IPA. The bitterness is there with some nice resinous pine quality, but not all that much in the way of citrus character. The malt is again toasty and fairly pronounced on the front end.  M: The body is medium with a low to moderate level of carbonation and a lingering bitterness on the tongue.

10099,6108,ludachris,4,"Now that I've acquired a bit more knowledge in terms of beer and further developed my palate, I've decided to re-visit some of the beers I rated early on. This, one of my personal favourites, happens to be one of them. This re-rating resulted in a slightly lower mark.  Pours a clear and brawny orangey-gold with a finger and a half of creamy white head that displays decent retention and leaves large sticky patches of lace.  Fresh pine, grapefruit rhine, a bit of pineapple, and a nice hefty dose of bready malts, with a touch of caramel in the nose.  Hoppy goodness coming from the citrus and pine notes hit the palate first and gradually move to the sides of the mouth, making way for the sweet buttery and bready malts.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, and displays an all around good balance between malt and hops.  This beer not only made the American IPA my favourite style, but also really opened my eyes to the craft beer industry. I'm a bit disappointed that it turned out not as good as I remembered it to be, but I'm sure I was a bit nostalgic about it from the time I first had it to now. Still none the less an excellent American IPA, and one that I'll be happy to buy time and time again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,yeahnatenelson,3.61,"Appearance - Golden orange, just shy of amber, with about two fingers of head on the pour. As the glass empties a kind of fog hovers over the liquid line, but never seems to dissipate. Little bit of lacing.  Smell - Grassy hops, sourdough bread, little bit of grapefruit, and a faint whiff of alcohol.  Taste - Grassy, piney, resiny hops flavor. There's a little bit of citrus in the backdrop, but it's not a key player; this is definitely an East Coast IPA. A sweet malt character comes in toward the back end, and finishes a little dry, but not too dry.  Mouthfeel - Very smooth, but at the same time it didn't seem like it was missing any carbonation. A dry, slightly oily finish.  Drinkability - This is a smooth, tasty East Coast IPA that the average beer drinker and the craft brew fan might find common ground.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,birchstick,3.51,"A - pours a faint copper with a foamy 1/2 finger head  S - Piney hops dominate; there are also some malts present  T - Taste is very similar to the nose. The palate is dominated by piney hops; there are some citrus hops present, but they are very much overshadowed by the pine. There is also a nice sweet and grainy malt backbone to help balance some of the hops. Overall, this is a very bitter IPA.  M - smooth and full bodied with some good carbonation  D - This was a good IPA. The hops are almost too much though as the bitterness took something away from the drinkability of this one for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

I would drink a case of this if i could handle the alcohol.  M: The mouthfeel is alright, you can feel the carbonation.  D: I'm not sure about this one, the alcohol content is solid, but the problem with this is the fact that it can fill you up rather quickly.

S-american citrus hops / slight malt flavor.  T-balanced slightly more on the hops compared to the malt but it has caramel sweetness w/ a little added complexity from the English ale yeast I think.

Smell - Hoppy citrus smell right off the back, following by a slight bread scent. The scent is well balanced.  Taste - Taste similar to the smell, citrus and hops. It is a little weak, and I didn't get that nice bite that you can get from some other IPA's.  Mouthfeel - Good mouthfeel, not overly dry like some IPA's can be. I can taste the alcohol, sometimes tastes like it could be even higher than 6.00%.  Drinkability - I could drink a few of these, they go down pretty easily.

10099,6108,Pittsburgh,4.15,"Overall a very good IPA as you can see by the marks, but I was expecting more. I have had it before, but never to write a review on and compare to other beers.  Maybe it is all the hype I hear about how good it is, but I think Harpoon makes an IPA that rivals it.  Definitely a smooth beer, you can tell its quality ingredients, the consistency is excellent, excellent appearance, pour is great, but the taste is lacking a little bit for me, needs a little more flavor, maybe more thickness would be the thing.  I will try the 120 next, maybe that is the ticket, but the 60 minute is just above average for me, esp. at $9.99 for 6. Needs more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,joemeister,4.48,"Pours a clear, golden-orange color with about an inch of frothy head. Bubbles rise to the surface by the thousands. I dig how the foam doesn't totally die out...even after I let the beer warm for a few minutes there is still a nice layer of frothy, hoppy goodness waiting for me.  This has a very nice hop smell; spiced pine and citrus aromas abound, with a hint of sweetness fighting for attention in the background.  Mmm. The taste is really very good. Now I wish I had compared this head-to-head last night with Founders Double Trouble because the profile is similar. The hop presence is definitely floral and piney. Carbonation is moderate and it gives way to a smooth and lingering display of sour citrus - sort of like an orange with a lot (but not all) of the sugar removed.  The head is a fighter and it's trying to stay alive as I work my way down to the halfway point. The rings on the side of the glass are creeping up on perfection. The head contributes to a fuller mouthfeel - creamy in some respects but thin in others.  This is a great IPA. I should disclaim that I've grown to be somewhat of a DFH ""fanboi,"" and I think that this beer is illustrative of the fact that their product lines deal in varying degrees of perfection. One of these days I'm going to hit the 60, 90, and 120 in chronological progression because I think each is the perfect preface to the next.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smelled of citrus and hops, also getting a little sweetness.  Taste pretty much followed the nose, a little pine in there, mild grapefruit, sweetness is present, followed by a little bitterness on the finish.

The flavors are very good but a little week for an IPA.  M- The mouth-feel is awesome, very wet and refreshing, with great balance between light body and medium carbonation. Not quite what I want in an IPA. Almost feels like a good lager.  D- I could quaff many of these. Almost as easy to drink as water.

No doubt about it, this is still a great IPA, but it does pale in comparison to the most excellent 90-minute, and at least in bottled form, I guess I will continue to stick with the 90-minute despite the additional cost.  Homing in on taste specifically, the 60-minute simply does not offer the depth and nuance of flavors that the 90-minute offers. Both the hop and malt profiles are substantially more subdued.

10099,6108,SpeedwayJim,3.79,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Captain Lawrence pint glass.  A: Vigorous pour generates a 2 finger coarse, white head with great retention. Beer is clear orange, showcasing an ample amount of carbonation. Lacing is frothy but stays close to beer level.  S: Citrus hoppiness, rubbery, a surprising hint of nuttiness and coffee. Nose is very subdued for an IPA, likely due to the foreign coffee scent.  T: Hits hard with coffee upfront, citrus hops linger in the back a bit before becoming more and more apparent as the surprising coffee bitterness starts to fade. Not too hoppy at all, very balanced. Piney hops more present in the second sip along with a citrus sweetness balancing it out. Fades with piney hop character that lingers just a touch before it fades. A really odd IPA to say the least, but neverthless, an enjoyable combination of flavors.  M: Light bodied, and as my mouth confirms what I see, highly carbonated and refreshing. Watery mouthfeel with a finish that isn't overwhelming. Leaves a certain stickiness on my lips and my tongue but also surprisingly dry for the style.  D: Strange beer but I like the combination. Mouthfeel is appropriate for the style and while the nose is a bit lacking (I'm expecting a little more over the top and... *sniffable) the flavor is not.

Grows throughout, what was supposed to be a straight forward ipa has some difficult to pinpoint nuances. Nice.  Drinkability, I deduct some points for the high cost of this beer.

10099,6108,zoso493,4.05,"Poured from an old 12 oz. bottle on 10/17/09 into a straight-sided pint glass.  Appearance: A vigorous pour produces a nice copper-colored IPA with only a slight one-finger head that dies down quickly and leaves some moderate lacing on the glass.  Smell: This one has what seems to me to be a faded scent of juicy, fruity hops balanced by some sweet and syrupy malts. Pretty standard smell, though I bet it would smell a lot better if it were bottled less than 3 and a half months ago.  Taste: Starts out sweet with a nice but light taste of mild, fruity hops. The malts are presented in the middle with a nice honeyish sweetness. Finishes with a pleasant and again light bittering. Fairly average taste for an IPA.  Mouthfeel: This is definitely on the thicker side for a regular IPA, which is pretty appealing to me. It's fairly lightly carbonated, which may contribute to the thickness.  Drinkability: This is a fairly drinkable IPA as it's pretty light in flavor, but I could think of a lot of other IPA's I'd rather be sipping on right now. It's also got a pretty low ABV at 6%, but I still wouldn't session it, especially at the $10 price tag for a sixer here in North Carolina.  Overall, this is a pretty average IPA and a bit disappointing after the excellent 90 Minute I drank last night. It does a good job of being thick-bodied, but the taste just doesn't match up to the texture as it's just too light on the flavor. This would be a good IPA for someone who's not a huge hophead, but let's face it, you drink IPA's because you love hops. I'm probably being a little harsh on this beer as it's not the freshest example, and I would definitely have another one to compare.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Excellent retention and lacing. This is a fine looking IPA.  The nose is well balanced between earthy, caramely malt and floral, herbaceous hops. If you are looking for a bright, citrusy hop dominant IPA, this is not your beer. I am enjoying sniffing this beer, as it is pretty unique among the IPA crowd.  The hops have a nice progression and stay on the palate from the flavoring all the way through the bittering finish. There is a strong and earthy malt presence that is making me think maris otter malt? Regardless, this is a very approachable and easy to drink IPA that is well balanced.

The hops mainly show in a huge aggressive bitterness, but some hoppy resin is still there to be found. Some hot alcohol is present unfortunately.

In this case the taste is better than the smell. This is not to say the smell is bad it is fine but doesn't comvey to the drinker the full range of flavors that sre found in the beer.  T: wonderful take. a middle of the tongue maltiness followed by a moderate hop bitterness with a crisp and spicy finish.  D: If you are a hophead like me then the drinkability of this beer is high.  Great beer. I have bought this many times and will never pass up the opportunity to drink one.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ghebel,4.3,"A - Pours very clear gold color with adequate head that leaves lacing on the glass.  S - Caramel malt and citrus/ earthy hops.  T - Balanced bitterness with sweet malt and earthy/ spicy hops.  M - Carbonation sting. Moderate to thin body. Lingering bitterness.  D - Very drinkable.  Overall - Good beer for when I am in the mood for a thinner IPA to drink ""more than one"". Watch to ABV however as after a few it adds up.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Whiteweasel,3.95,"Appearance: A goldenrod colour which pours completely clear. Head is thick and dissipates quickly. Carbonation comes up continuously.  Smell: Very hoppy yet sweet. A little malty, with hints of tropical fruits.  Taste: Suprisingly balanced between hops and other flavours. Pleasant sweetness from the fruitiness but still bitter from the hops. Some distinct hop flavour that I can't really identify by name.  Mouthfeel: Very good job hiding the alcohol character. Still a small amount of warmth, but the bitterness makes sure the booze sneaks up on you. Carbonation is present and pleasant. Smooth feel, but leaves the mouth a little rough yet very clean from the bitterness.  Drinkability: More of a slower drinking beer but probably just because of the hoppiness. Doesnt ruin your palate however, and the abv isn't too excessive so its drinkability isnt bad.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Jayli,3.76,"Consumed 1/1/10  A: This beer pours a murky deep copper color with a one finger of creamy white head. Head retains nicely and leaves sheets of lacing on the glass.  S: Nose is of strong citrus and piney hops, very big malt presence in the nose.  T: Much more hoppy than the nose would indicate. Big citrus hop burst up front that moves in to a big malt presence, touch of breadiness, and a piney and grassy finish.  M: Medium body, medium carbonation, somewhat oily feel with a dry finish.  D: Decent beer, goes down easily, it didn't amaze or remotely wow me, but a good offering of the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,sjccmd,4.2,"Pours light golden, light amber. Slightly hazy. 1 finger off-white head that recedes quickly. Lacing is fairly sticky as it inches down the glass.  Smells of sweet grapefruit, oranges, some pine, and honey-like malt sweetness. The sweetness is kind of surprising, but in a good way. The aroma seems to fade quickly as the head dies down.  Pine, oranges, and grapefruit come around again in the flavor, but in that order. Rounded off with caramel and honey flavors from the malts. Finishes with a mild bitterness. Spicy, piney hops and biscuity malts linger.  Nice and sparkly mouthfeel. I get the feeling it may be a bit watery if the carbonation dies down too much, but the flavors on the finish keep that from being a nuisance.  Highly drinkable. It's a bit difficult to drink just one. I could definitely see this as becoming a ""go-to beer"" for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,barleywort,3.7,"Appearance: poured a nice golden colour with the faintest look of copper. Surprisingly voluminous head that dissipated with nearly as surprising quickness...consistent yet minimal lacing on the glass as consumed.  Smell: Highly hopped aroma but not much else in the nose...perhaps a sign of things to come?  Taste: Powerful and pungent citrusy hops character with maybe subtle herbal/grassy notes, but nothing truly discernable.  Mouthfeel: very crisp, but with a slick, oily character that comes in behind the crispness and lingers. The citrus of the hops doesn't linger and soon you're left with an odd but not unpleasant bitter sensation on your tongue and a warmth in your chest.  Drinkability: Not as hoppy as I had imagined; this, in my opinion, makes it all the more drinkable. That being said, I wouldn't count this as a session beer in my own repertoire.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,danetrain0101,3.73,"The color is very dark golden with a light cloudy haze. Nice thin foamy head.  Strong presence of hops and malt. Very pleasant IPA smell. A strong presence of alcohol.  Very hoppy. Nice and refreshing but truly lives up to its name of 60 minute. Nice bitterness which is balanced by the alcohol. A strong after taste of bitter hops.  A nice beer to have with a burger or a strong dinner.

Taste was similar. This is an easy to drink IPA, nothing wild or crazy, just an easy to drink, very solid IPA. Quite enjoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,coldwarkid,4.2,"Appearance: Deep golden/amber at the edges with a radiant orange center. Two finger thick head with great lacing.  Smell: Pineapple and tangerine/apricot scents with a bit of herbal/pine bitterness. Sugar cookie-like malt sweetness. A little bit of alcohol as it warms.  Taste: Tasty hop flavors - pine and tangerine/orange citrus fruit and a pleasant, mild, lingering hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Faint kiss of malt sweetness and alcohol in the finish, especially as it warms. Fairly mild as far as IPAs go, making it very sessionable, which was the brewer's intent, if I recall correctly. The continual hopping really does give a lot more of the hop flavor without the intense bitterness of most IPAs.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth, medium-full body. like velvet as it goes down, with a nice bit of prickly carbonation. very nice body for a regular IPA. Not watery or lacking at all in this department.  Like a step up in the hop department from SN Pale Ale. Great session brew, similar to SN Celebration with a less complex nose but a better, fuller mouthfeel.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,soupyman10,4.1,"A go-to brew of mine that I somehow have neglected to review. Pours a orangy copper color with a small white head that leaves a touch of lacing. Nose is slightly spicy citrus hoppiness with a nice caramel malt backbone. A very stereotypical - if good - nose. Flavor is similar, a very light ""sprightly"" IPA. Citrus and fruitiness are the dominant flavors, and dirty hops as well. Biting hops on the tongue, especially as it warms up. Body is light with busy carbonation to keep things in line with the lighter hop feel to this beer. Overall, a nice IPA although I prefer it on tap. Probably not quite as good as the Hop Devil which is the alternative ""local"" IPA that I'd go to.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,EskimoDave,3.68,"60 Minute IPA pours a light copper with a small head. The aroma is much lighter on the hop side than you would imagine. Mostly citrus aromas with a pineapple smell being the main source of the citrus smell. A slightly malty body comes through leading to a almost medium body, a little lighter than I like in my IPAs. It's kind of sweet and it feels like it comes from the hops, which also add a citrus and pineapple flavour. This is followed by a slight bitterness and light drying, but still kind of sweet feeling. Its a nice beer, but a bit too sweet for me. I think it would be best suited for a hot summer day. With the IPA market the way it is I cannot see myself buying this beer again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

It was in the fridge for a long time so in the beginning the flavors was kind of stuck but as the beer begin to warm the flavors became more apparent, i began to taste the malts a littel bit more and the creaminess came thru. the mouthfeel was smooth. and after one and a half beers i felt a nice buzz with no food on my stomach.

The taste is stongly bitter and dry. They feel is medium bodied with a clean finish. This is an excellent and enjoyable IPA.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,EJNibs,3.94,"A: Poured into a pint glass: no real head to speak of, but a nice orange-amber hue, a bit lighter in color than i'd expected.  S: Very nice; a nice strong hop aroma with a hint of citrus at first, but there are some sweeter malt tones present as well. The nose is nice, but it isn't quite as pungent as I'd like. After your olfactory nerves become accustomed to it, it's hard to get as much complexity on the third smell, even after swirling a bit.  T: Not bad at all. The 60 minute strikes a niec balance between hops and malt. In fact, I found it quite similar to the nose insofar as it started hoppy, but finished with a little malt sweetness.  M: Very nice body to this beer. The last IPA I had was a touch disappointing in it's weak mouthfeel, but this has it just right; fullness without being too heavy for the style.  D: With both a good mouthfeel a well struck balance between hops and malt, this is a very drinkable IPA.  Verdict: Though this is a very nice, well balanced IPA, it falls shy of perfection for me in that it doesn't scream ""you better have another one of me in the fridge or you'll regret it."" The hops are nice with a bit of citrus, and the malt is present but in balance. Better than a great many IPAs on the market, and worth a shot, but I'm still searching for my holy grail.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Thin white lacing appeared as the session progressed as well as the head reducing to a thin fizzy white raft.  S: Not sure if it's me or the beer but I could hardly pick up any aroma with some light hints of pine and holiday spice.  T: Oddly enough this IPA to me was only the slightest bit hop-forward, with a pleasant pine and orange-peel taste. Less hop character than I expected from a continuously hopped IPA. The malt balance is much appreciated with caramel and toasty notes.  M: Good carbonation and well-balanced beer = full bodied and smooth  D: Again, balance and flavor lead to a long session beer that would be interesting to see some age on.  Note quite as strong of an IPA as I am accustomed to but well done. Balance is much appreciated in a style that is so often not.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,generalnotsew,3.78,A: Nice bourbon color. Has a decent head but fades quite quickly and lacing does not stick at all.  S: Mostly dirty earthy hops. I am not getting much out this one. One thing I should mention up front is that it is 6 months old but at least kept in a cooler.  T: Mostly just the earthy notes. This one has quite a bit of a malt backbone. Something I don't see much in a IPA. Still has a nice touch of hops. I have had this before and it is exceptional fresh but also pretty good with age.  M: Fairly thin. Not overly carbonated which is also a good thing.  D: Very easy drinking brew. I feel like I could guzzle it.  I am not sure if the age may affect it that much or if my tastes have really changed since I had it last. Probably a bit of both. I had been heavily into DIPA's lately but I also just reviewed SN Anniversary and was quite happy.  I am mostly sure it is the age although I must say for a regular IPA it does hold up over time. I repeat again this stuff is exceptional when you know it is fresh.

There's something deep in the nose that is really appealing but hard to identify, like the sinus sensation of having a headcold. It's a lot more enjoyable than it sounds. Starts with a suggestion of sweetness which quickly becomes bitter, but the bitterness complements nicely a malty core. Very drinkable with a light/medium body and nice carbonation.

First taste will take you to the pulse of the American Dream where you will not need Hunter S Thompson could go on for days about how all Americans should stock their fridges with this one. Do you want sweet malt taste.. check! Do you require Hophead bitterness... look no further. This brew was a favorite of mine before all those west coast ales started to push boundaries of my pallet with 7% + ABV.This brew can be a gateway beer for your non craft brew pals. It prides me to see this one on draft in my favorite watering holes. I am not sure if i would be checking this site out daily if not for stumbling on this brew pub in 1998 in Rehoboth DE.

10099,6108,FeloniousDrunk,4.28,"I poured this beer into a 12 oz. mug and it fit perfectly with a nice two-finger head on it. The lacing was fairly substantial and the head dimmed down to a light ring of froth around the edges which stuck with it all the way down the glass. A wet-hay color with golden hues persisted through this mostly clear beer.  The odor was nothing to write home about. Very light fragrances of apricot and other dried fruit wafted up with a light spiciness. Good, but you have to really dig to get the odors out, nothing hits you right-away.  The beer sits in your mouth with a crisp, well-rounded feel and swallows with a tingly freshness that is quite delightful.  The taste is a tad leathery (this is a positive thing) and the crisp dryness is not overbearing. It is cut with fruity notes of apples, apricots and berries on the swallow. It is well-rounded and less bitter than the average IPA (probably due to the length of time, which usually mellows out the hop flavor.)  This beer is a delight. It tastes like an ideal library: full of leather-bound books on mahogany shelves with a crackling fire on a crisp Autumn day.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T: Citrus and floral characteristics come through strongly along with a fairly assertive hop bitterness. More malty flavor comes as the beer warms along with a more pronounced alcohol bite. Refreshing and crisp though.  M: Fair amount of carbonation. Dry and doesn't leave much of a residue. Nice.  D: Light and crisp, could definitely drink several of these without problem.  O: Very impressed, not usually a huge IPA fan but this one could change that.

10099,6108,dudemuskie,4.24,"Appearance- slightly hazy, bright orange color with 1.5 finger eggshell white, foamy head. Head settles rather quickly but leaves some residual lacing.  Aroma- malty sweet caramel holds up a bright citrusy, floral, resinous nosefull of hops.  Flavor- starts with hops front and center from the tip to the back of the tongue- citrusy and resinous. A quick wave of malty caramel and toffee rides down the middle, fading quickly to a mouth full of hops. Finishes slightly bitter but with enough caramel to really make this beer refreshing and well balanced. Hop bitterness and a whisper of alcohol linger in the mouth with some time as do some soft green/grassy hop flavors.  Mouthfeel- well carbonated at moderate-high levels leaving a bit of a CO2 sting on the tip of the tongue. CO2 also gets hops popping as soon as it hits the tongue. Almost tastes like eating a fresh sticky hop covered in caramel! Medium body with a slightly sticky finish. Quite drinkable and sessionable.  Overall- very tasty AIPA with loads of hop flavor that is well balanced by a firm malty backbone. Not as big as the 90 or 120 but bright hop flavors more prominent as a result! Excellent example of the style that would pair nicely with funky cheeses, a black and bleu burger, or some spicy chili!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

It has a one finger off white head that dissolves to a decent ring. Lots of bubbles can be seen rising.  S-Here is where it gets odd. There is a surprising roast malt aroma that gives it a strong coffee presence. There are some light citrus notes. If I had a blindfold on I would guess this was a porter.  T-Orange rind and grapefruit kick it off with some citrus flavor. There is also a little pine. The roast malt that is so strong in the nose appears midsip. It finishes with some caramel sweetness and some bitter grapefruit. The roast flavor with the hops reminds me of a black IPA.  M-Medium bodied. It is dry and is properly carbonated.  D-The roast really hurts this one.  I haven't had one of these in probably 4 years and can't recall if this one always had the roast flavor. I'll have to try it fresh on tap before reserving final judgment.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The beer itself is a pale gold, and reasonably pleasant looking, but unremarkable.  The smell is reasonably gentle for an IPA (and VERY gentle for a Dogfish Head beer), but has pleasant notes of pine and citrus, with hints of a refreshing grassiness.  The taste is reasonably light, with a moderate degree of bitterness up front, along with noticeable citrus notes, as promised from the smell. The aftertaste is a mild bitterness at the back of the tongue, along with a subtle malt that is barely noticeable at first. Overall, very crisp and refreshing.  The mouthfeel is crisp, with a lot of carbonation. There isn't much residue left to coat the tongue, and each sip feels fresh.

Smell: Subdued floral, pine, a bit of malt. Smells quite nice, just nothing that reaches out and grabs you.  Taste: Hops right away, not too strong, not too bitter. Sweet bread taste backs up the citrus hops. Both give way to piney bitterness at the end.  Mouthfeel: Feels a bit oily. Bitterness sicks to your whole mouth after each taste. Goes down easy.  Drinkability: Easy to drink, seems to be well balanced. Alcohol is well hidden. Could easily drink a few of these.

S: Deep pine note, slight hint of citrus T: Bold hops flavor, but not exceptionally bitter. In fact, I detect a particularly sweet, almost caramel note that blends nicely with the hops finish. M: Moderate bodied, carbonation prevalent.  A fine beer, balanced and subtle, leaving the American hops to do their thing without being overpoweringly bitter. That said, this is American IPA light in my opinion and though it's good, you have to give the 90 or 120 minute IPA flagship status out of Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

First thing i noticed off the bat was the clarity of this beer. It had almost a pilsner-like quality too it. Poured with a big, foamy white head. The body of the beer showed some quite furious bubbling from within. Seemed to reatain the head pretty well as well as leaving a good bit of lacing on the glass.  S: This was the most unique part of this beer to me. Dogfish head always reminds you how not so normal they are. This isnt a bad thing though by any means. The aroma here was very malty but back with a nice floral hop spice which gave the whole beer a musky bread-like aroma.  T: Hops hit first here, which is a great counter to the smell. Very well balanced beer! The hops hit strong but fade very smoothly into the malt body.  M: Great carbonation. Very light body. It was fairly dry at first but seemed to somehow make an oily finish appear. I liked it.  D: Drinking very well. Could drink this any time. I was very pleasantly suprised by this beer. Definitely my favorate Dogfish Head beer to date.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,OlieIPA,4.23,"I'd been looking forward to trying this beer fresh for quite some time, so when my good buddy came over with three 12 oz. bottles last night and told me they were fresh...my beer drinking palate became quickly excited. Thanks Mike for this generous offering.  A: Poured light with a bright yellow-golden hue into a standard pint glass. This particular IPA exhibited many positive qualities I like to find with most beers within this style including a beautiful off white 2-finger head, nice lacing, and a body that looked light and refreshing. The only knock I'm going to give this beer is the lack of head retention and lacing degradation.  S: An obvious hop aroma upfront that mainly consisted of pine and citrus-like notes. The malt body is quite unique on the nose as well and can be best described as grainy bread.  T: Pine, citrus, and a spent-grain flavor top to bottom...again, very unique. Tastes like an IPA, but the body is something to marvel over. I feel like I'm eating bread that was baked from the spent-grain used from my homebrew. The finish is very nice as well...not overly bitter (but does have some punch) and very musky.  M: A little dry (nice for the style), gentle carbonation, and at some points...oily.  D: Very impressed! A perfect example of a session IPA and the flavor profile adds a nice twist on the style as well.  Overall: Prefer this over the 120 and 90 minute IPA produced from DFH and something I'll be enjoying again soon. A must try. Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,OttoBomb,3.77,"12 oz. bottle poured into a 16 oz pint glass (October 13, 2009).  Eyes: Hazy orange (I guess), not a significant head, low retention.  Nose: Strong hop kick, citrus, pine and the sweet malt is quite evident. Complex with a decent yeasty, musty backbone.  Tongue: A green hoppy, grassy taste bookends the malt sweetness. Complex flavors help to carry the bitterness, but not enough in my opinion.  Mouth: Quite bitter, thick and coats the mouth.  Libation: I'll preface this by saying that I tried this because I liked the DFH 90 Minute IPA. This brew is good, but I don't appreciate it as much as the 90. This is just a bit less complex and a bit too bitter for the flavor. That said, a solid IPA by any measure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,fightingwords,3.92,"A--dull golden almost orange at the edges. Slightly cloudy. Clingy sticky big white head.  S--balanced nose bready malts some earthiness, piney and herb-y hops.  T--caramel malts give way to big but not overbearing piney hops. Wonderful.  M--medium body, clean quick finish (suprised by the lack of oilyness), found it almost kind of dry.  D--dangerous.  famous for a reason, unpretentious by nature, drink when you want a real and balanced IPA. IPA's don't have to rip your mouth up to be full of flavor and this beer proves it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,natelocc787,3.3,"Pretty light session character to this IPA. Has a nice aroma with yellow cake batter, spruce, pineapple syrup and oranges. The taste could be bigger, sprucy, not much pine flavor, citrus flavors like light orange and lemon peel. The mouthfeel score was close to being bumped up, the head retained at a half finger until it was gone, carbonation was just right. Sessionable for sure but there are much better options IMO. Not as good as their other IPA's.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,taxguyjase,4.27,"The beer poured a light golden color with a stout white foamy head, which really stuck around. You get the lovely floral citrus boutique that you would expect from an IPA. The beer isn't terribly bitter, but does have some bitterness to it. The hops are still there, just not overly pronounced. The beer feels really smooth and well blended, which I come to expect from Dogfish Head brews. If I could get this in town, I would get it again. This is a high quality IPA that I would definitely use to introduce folks to the style.  Appearance - 4.0/5.0 - Light golden color, good white foamy head that stuck around for a bit. Smell - 4.5/5.0 - Lovely citrus, floral boutique Taste - 4.0/5.0 - Enough bitterness to be in line with the style, but not so much to knock your socks off. A good representation of the style. Feel -4.5/5.0 - Smooth, well blended. Very little aftertaste Drinkability - 4.5/5.0 - If I could get it in Albuquerque, would be a regular purchase.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,canucklehead,4.1,I have had this beer many times but they just started showing up as singles in the government liqour store. Great IPA with really nice balance and plenty of hops. I could drink this all night. Not as complex as say Ballast Point but still a top notch IPA with great drinkability and balance,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,towersfall,3.73,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy copper with a small head that holds very little retention and leaves little to no lacing.  Smell: Not turned on to the smell at all. Smells of burnt nuts and citrus fill my nostrils. And something else that I just can't put my finger on.  Taste: Very nice hop presence that causes this IPA to be completely drinkable. The hops and citrus blend well together to create a decent IPA.  Mouthfeel: A nice balance in body with a glorious amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Great light IPA. It would probably be safe to say this is a light version of their 90 Minute. Would be a great session beer though.  If you want a SOLID IPA from Dogfish Head, go with their 90 Minute, not this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,GregSVT,4.13,A: Pours a slightly hazy faint amber with a big white head that reduces to a nice layering accross the top and leaves a lot of sticky lacing.  S: The nose is hops followed by sweet tropcial fruits like pineapple/mango and malt. There's also an herbal aroma in the background. Very reminiscent of the 90 minute but not as high powered hops.  T: Wow more hop bitterness than I was expecting but the fruity flavors are there on the finish. The bitterness is slightly herbal as well and last for a while.  M: Good carbonation that leads to a creamy feel.  D: Good example of an American IPA and the ABV makes this very sessionable.  I still prefer the 90 Minute to this one as it has more fruity/malty flavors and isn't all hops. This would be good if you wanted something to drink while at a bar watching a game and didn't want to get bombed quickly.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

In the aftertaste the earthy tones are very noticeable, along with the slight citrus that was present in the aroma.  Medium bodieed, with some nice carbonation Very nice mouthfeel.

10099,6108,wesbrownyeah,3.88,"Well i'll be damned if i haven't reviewed this beer yet... after numerous 90 mins and countless 120's it a shame. Its like this.  A- Pours a sharp golden copper colored fluid with excellent half inch head containing tightly carbonated bubbles. Beautiful craft look of great cascading lacing on rim of Ommegang Goblet. Perfect clairity.  S- Smell is a musky malt tang with light hints of citrus and grassy hops in the nose. Smells of fresh cut grass and barley.  T-M- The kiss of the brew packs a nice upfront hop bitterness balanced with supurb malt backbone. Light citrus, carmel, and brown sugar is what comes to mind. Complex but simple flavors... get the job done. Mouthfeel is inpectable due to the perfect hop and malt balance it rolls over the tongue with ease leaving a mild bitter bite and ligering astringent feel.  D- Definitly a session beer that can and will take you where you want to be with a style that is untouched and perfect for any occation... pricey at 11 buck a twelve pack though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Very refreshing.  Mouth feel: medium body with nice carbonation.  Drinkability: quite drinkable indeed. This would make a great session IPA. Very light for an IPA or at least compared to some of the other IPA's I've tried.  Overall, great beer. Very drinkable and wouldn't sour your palet if you drank 3-4 during a good session.

10099,6108,Lunch,4.55,"Had on-tap at Frisco Grille in Columbia, MD (11/05/09). Served in a 16oz. pint glass at an appropriate temperature.  A: Pours a hazy golden, orange capped with 1 finger of an off-white head which stuck around for a while and left wonderful lacing that covered every inch of the glass until the end.  S: A citrus bouquet that included orange, lemon, and tropical fruit with a slight floral scent with an overall piney quality. A hint of sweet malt came through as well.  T: First of all this beer is extremely well balanced especially when fresh. The palate is hit with fruity hops that contain orange, tropical fruit, pine, lemon, subdued yet rich malt and a slightly bitter finish to round out this quality beverage.  M: Medium body with perfect carbonation and a slight oily texture.  D: Exceptionally drinkable as the flavors are so well balanced and the humble 6% abv. is hidden perfectly. This is a true sessionable IPA.  Overall I find this beer to be one of the best American IPAs and perhaps the best on the east coast. I must say however, that this beer is best enjoyed as fresh as possible as age truly detracts from the delicious hop flavor and overall balance. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,Ezekiel81923,3.98,"Case from the beeryard. First bottle, bottled 8/14/09 so hopefully this is still fresh. Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Big foamy 2-finger white head, slowly becomes rocky as it recedes to a thin layer, leaving amazing lacing. Poured a clear golden yellow color with active carbonation streaming up the center of the brew from the bottom of the mug.  Smell: Citrus aroma's hit my nose first, with some grassy and piney aroma's mingled in. A slight bready malt sweetness in the background as well, but pretty masked by the citrus.  Taste: The bready malts do a good job of balancing out the citrus hop flavors. Some floral, almost grassy flavors in there as well, and some hints of tangerine in the finish. The malt has an almost nutty feel to it.  Mouthfeel: Active carbonation on the tongue the second it hits. Some lingering bitterness, carbonation and hop oils on the tongue and roof of my mouth make for a good finish. Could be a little less carbonated, this borders soda carbonation.  Drinkability: Light-Medium body and low ABV make this a pretty reasonable drink. Could imagine this case would disappear quick if my friends were here.  Solid gateway IPA that's interesting enough for the seasoned beer drinker as well. A great effort once again from Dogfish.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BrewitYerself,3.84,"Pours with a thick, dense off white head. Very clear gold with a copper hue. Good sticky lacing.  Smells of fruity/grassy hops, bright citrus, medium berry-like esters. Some sweet/toasty malt. A hint of mint. Somewhat boozy. More sweet honey-like malts come out as it warms.  A tingle of hops and bitterness upfront becomes very fruity with a light and mildly sweet toasty malt background. Fruity flavor seems to come from both hops and esters. Bitterness fades from the start to the finish, leaving a mild lingering pithiness with a touch of sweet malt. Slightly sour.  Mouthfeel is fairly full for the style; perfect carbonation: moderate, but enough to make the hops tingle. Has a nice slightly chewy texture.  Overall it's a nice beer. Not enough malt to be very noticeable, but enough to balance the bitterness. Has a nice finish. Very estery for an American IPA. Good mouthfeel and tasty balanced finish make it very drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Well balanced, not to overwhelming! Crisp carbonation. A light and tasty brew.  Mouthfeel- Goes down smooth, has a good finish. Tastes like flowers!

Lots of citrus and some flowery bits all around. Some caramely sweetness and slight bit of bread from the malty malt. I really think the smell is the best aspect of the beer.  The taste follows the nose quite closely with a bit more focus on the hops. Dries out a little bit more than expected as well. There's good weight here, not too chewy or thin.

Get the great flavor of DFH IPA without the price. Pours a golden color with little head. Smooth and not as rich as the 90 Minute IPA.

Strong crisp hop bite on the tip of the tongue, with a slight citrus fruitiness on the back end. Hops fade in the finish leaving a dry, almost yeasty aftertaste. Quite nice.

10099,6108,JohnL9013,3.23,"I had the Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA and was really floored by its quality, and I was so inspired that I picked up a six-pack of these. I'm disappointed.  A: tan-ish-brown  S: Certainly, this beer has a proper level of hopping required for an IPA. The most disturbing feature of this beer is the presence of that cheap funk you get from any of your bud lights, coors lights, etc, or a poorly constructed summer beer. It's almost like the materials used to make this weren't fresh... at all, or something.  T: Again, excellent hopping going on here, but that sour disgusting cheap beer aftertaste is just thoroughly disturbing. I don't know what went wrong in this batch, or how it got past QC, but it does not taste like a clean, fresh beer... plain and simple.  M: Too much carbonation going on here. It's unpleasant.  D: This ends up being about average when it finally hits your stomach. I'd say I could pound down quite a few of these at once, as long as I was ignoring the fact that it doesn't taste good.  Let's put this in perspective. I've had the Harpoon IPA before, which is quite boring and doesn't have nearly the quality or quantity of hop flavor this has, however, it was extremely clean tasting and wasn't sour at all.  If you want to try this beer in your area, find a place that has it on tap or sells single bottles, but don't buy a six-pack like I did.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

I will review with the age in consideration.  Pours crystal clear gold in color, with 1"" of snow white head. Retention is okay, but not great. Head leaves behind sheets of sticky lacing. By the time I take the first sip, the head has subsided to a thin sheet, but the lacing just doesn't quit.  Smell is rich with pine and grapefruit. Aroma is full of sweet honey and molasses notes. As it warms, the smell becomes sweeter and more floral.  Taste starts bitter, but finishes sweet. It is unexpectedly toasty for a brew so light in color. It is obvious that some of the hop flavors have dissipated, but still has a nice balance of bitterness and sweetness, and the malt jumps out a bit more.

Very pleasant.  T-Very hoppy, but balanced by a nice malt presence that is faint, but not overly sweet. Bitter up front, but finishes without the taste buds being assaulted. This was quite good.  M-Smooth and well balanced. Nice carbonation level.  D-This went down very easily and I would readily reach for another. Taste improves as it warms.  This was very similar to many West Coast IPAs, particularly Stone IPA. I am glad I gave this another try. The first one I had a couple of months ago was far too bitter and unbalanced.

The malt shows as well, with a biscuity malt and caramel notes being present. Almost like a snack cake aroma. The smell is delicious, but it wasn't nearly as hoppy as I would have imagined. The taste is fresh and inviting. The hops jump with citrus and pine and bitterness, but the malt holds it's own, with an almost toasted taste, biscuit malt tones, and caramel.

Some very nicely pronounced citrusy, piney hops aromas waft from my glass with touches of grain, bread, honey and caramel.  Taste is of bitter hops up front giving way to its relatively strong bready, buttery, caramel malt backbone that nicely balances against the hops - the alcohol is detectable in the background of it all.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and decently creamy with a nice amount of carbonation that cuts through the cream and leads to a spicy, somewhat oily finish.  Overall, this an easy-drinking, well balanced AIPA that packs a good amount of hops and malt but isn't as heavy as it's big brother, the 90 - making it far more sessionable. I was expecting alot from this beer and I think it delivered.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,kurp001,4.2,"12 oz. bottle bought at Crackpot Liquors  Pours a bright amber with gold highlights. A fairly gentle pour yields about one finger of bone white rocky head that holds up well.  Smell is assertive grapefruit and rich malt in the background.  Taste showcases the rich citrus and grapefruit flavors up front, while a bold malt backbone keeps things interesting without overpowering the hops.  Mouthfeel is nice, medium-bodied with lively carbonation that isn't too overpowering.  As far as IPAs go, this is incredibly drinkable. The 6% ABV technically disqualifies this from the ""session beer"" category, but I find myself making a session out of this one more often than I'd like to admit. The malt is more apparent than a traditional IPA, so if you prefer straight-up hop bombs you're probably best off looking elsewhere, but personally I'm a big fan of the balance on this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,jeffthecheff,4.49,"Bottled on 8/14/09. I bought this beer because it had a clear bottling date on it, and I'm an advocate of fresh beer.  Poured into a shaped pint, this India Pale Ale is...PALE! Nice golden color with perfect clarity. Head is white, a bit fluffy and ""loose-bubbled,"" keeping the appearance from a perfect score. I am really impressed with an IPA that is this light in color though.  Aroma is above average as far as IPA's go. I'm getting some tangerine/orange peel, some herb and spice, and some pine. There also seems to be some earth/wood in the aroma, which is something I really admire as a hop aroma. I love when an IPA is loaded up with crazy dry hops and smells like the freshest green you've ever smelled, but 60 minute is not that. I don't want to use the word balanced, but behind the hops there is some interesting malt and yeast subtlety that I'm really digging.  The taste is quite bitter, but there is a nice depth of flavor behind it to complement it. This beer has some great, English yeast character to round it out. At first, I didn't buy into the continuous hopping technique, but after brewing a beer myself with almost all late hop additions, I found that the same units of bitterness do taste/feel different when coming from different boiling times. The hop flavor is mostly fruity, but behind an aggressive bitterness. The sweetness of the malt really brings out the exotic, tropical fruitiness from the hops. I'm not so sure this beer is bitter anymore, its actually quite sweet.  Mouthfeel is just how I like it for an IPA. Moderate carbonation, lingering bitterness, and a bit of strength. This isn't the most exotic IPA there is, but it has a lot of character and feels just right whenever I have it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,drabmuh,4.35,"Had this beer on draft at Busboys and Poets in Arlington, VA. Served in a pint glass. Beer is dark yellow, not orange, steady carbonation, yellowish white head, thin, beer is clear, not cloudy at all. Aroma consists of a mixture of citrus and pine. Hard to pin down. Aroma is present but you kind of have to look for it, its easy to find but it is definitely not in your face. Bitterness is not what I expected. Really smooth, almost no aftertaste. This is usually difficult to achieve with an American IPA since bitterness is centered at the back of the tongue. The bitterness in this beer is well balanced for sure. Nicely cut with the midpalate flavors. Mouthfeel is fine and as expected. Drinkability is high, especially for an IPA. One of my favorite AIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Being a big DFH fan, I was excited for the opportunity.  A: Medium amber clear body with a fluffy white head that dissipates and leaves good lacing.  S: Citrus, grapefruit and a touch of hops.  T: Starts out with a citrus malt taste which doesn't resemble the sweeter backbone of 90 min. Bitter hops show up for a nice finish but the malt didn't seem to have the gravity to balance it out as well as other IPA's.  M: Medium body and nicely carbonated.  D: A nice, easy drinking IPA which leaves you satisfied. Not many flaws or wows to this brew, just solid overall. Still the high expectations set by 90 min and Indian Brown make this a bit of a disappointment.

Strong hoppy aroma with a bitter citrus smell in the forefront and a nice backing of pine. The flavor shows an abundant hop flavor with plenty of citrus and pine but with a nice balancing of malt. Still, the hop is king but doesn't overpower the drink. A nice, light refreshing feel with a great bracing bitterness that is kept in check by the malt. This is a beer that should be a must have for any bar/restaurant. I had it with a spicy jerk chicken sandwich and it worked perfectly. Great for spicy dishes.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

A: 2 fingers of ivory head over a dark golden and bright amber. A cap of frothy retention and cascading lace. A beauty. S: Roasted barley tones, caramel sweetness, and a deliciously subtle bitter hop note. T: Really hoppy goodness right up front. Bitter, floral, and herbal, with an emphasis on the bitter. It's all balanced out nicely by caramel malt. There's a distant bitter citrus/grapefruit, but it's pretty far off. M: Medium mouthfeel, high tingly carbonation, and lots of lingering bitter residuals. D: This is a good IPA, for sure. I'd like a bit more of a hop character that isn't simply bitter, but those are my tastes so I won't judge on that.

Typical standard and brief design for Dogfish bottles with an underlying backdrop of green hops. One liner description. Shows date of bottling (07/23/09), neither shows IBUs or °Plato, only Alc. by Vol. (6%) Poured into a tulip glass.  A - Deep gold color. Starts with a generous one inch off-white head that turns to a consistent ring on the beer and a nice surface layer. Some lacing as it goes down.  S - Crisp hoppy aroma. Feels fresh, straightforward and without much nuance other than a citrus hint.  T - Feels lighter than most IPAs but with a greater bitter end.  M - Quite carbonated on a medium body.  D - A nicely drinkable IPA assertive on the bitter character.  Notes: Nice IPA, although I'm quite a bit hooked up by the way Dogfish goes about brewing, this one while good is not a favorite from their line up. Good US IPA that lacks a bit of melody to make it to the next level in this style.

I still favor the 90 as it has all of the balance of this IPA but with a bit more of a hop bite that holds your attention.

Doesn't have the same hop punch. Taste is a fresh floral hop. Not much fruit though I suppose you could see some sort of tart with a pinch of grapefruit flavor in there but it's mostly floral (and delicious).

10099,6108,Darkhorse09,3.97,"Good IPA. Really enjoyed it. Not an extreme IPA, which seems to be the trend these days. An IPA everyone should try.  A - Foamy white head. Sticks to the glass all the way down and disappears slowly, but not too slowly.  S - Very sharp, floral and complex. Great smelling beer. Obvious hops and some citrus.  T - Not too bitter. Hoppy and delicious.  M - Good carbonation. Crisp, lighter body.  D - Could drink this IPA all night. really quit tasty.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Very slight haze, but could just be the glass  S - sharp floral and rich  T - surprisingly sweet. Actually too sweet for me. The sweetness is very up front and I think overcompensates for the bitterness.  M - medium to light in body. carbonation is fine  D - good beer, but I usually only want one before I want to switch it up. If it was a little less sweet then I could easily drink it all night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Brenden,4.2,"I had this one on tap at the Hyde Park Tavern in Cincinnati.  The color is a clear amber. There's some lively carbonation and a good, well-retained head leaves a thin sheet of lacing about halfway down the glass. There's something sweet and buttery in the aroma, which took me off guard. Very interesting for an IPA but intriguing. Otherwise there's a strong hops aroma balanced nicely with the malts. There's a real interplay between the bitterness of the hops, the sweetness of the malt, a zesty citrus tang and a buttery wheat biscuit sort of flavor. The mouthfeel is nice and crisp and also mixes in a decent smoothness. The body is medium. This is a tasty IPA in a more interesting form than most I;ve experienced.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,PerroGrande,3.88,"Appearance: Pours to a golden orange color with a fairly substantial head that endures surprisingly well. The head thins out to a sudsy foam with nice adhesion to the glass.  Smell: Nice and moderately complex. Hops are noticeable, as expected, but I also pick up some citrus overtones and a spice. As another reviewer suggested, I thought the spice might be cinnamon.  Taste: The taste experience opens fairly smoothly. The dry, hoppy finish enters the picture fairly quickly. There is a subtle sweetness that hangs around the edges that adds to the interest and complexity of this brew. Quite enjoyable overall.  Mouthfeel: Light carbonation produces a smooth drinking experience.  Drinkability: Excellent taste, good mouthfeel, and a fairly dry overall finish makes this a very drinkable beer. 6% ABV could sneak up on someone used to ""lighter"" beers.  This is a very nice IPA. I would recommend this to someone who is working their way into the IPA style. It has good IPA characteristics, but is manageable to someone coming from different brews or BMCs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

S- Citrus smell came out along with a hop smell, cannot really tell you what kind of hops. The smell is very louring and I am looking forward to trying this beer.  T- The citrus flavors are what come out the strongest at the front of this beer. Lemon seems to be what I am getting the most. As expected in an IPA, it finishes bitter and dry. Satisfying beer, there may be a little too much citrus for me, but still great.  M- Light to medium bodied, not too much carbonation. I think this is a great beer for summer or fall.

Tame citrus smell with some malt sweetness and - dare I say - a few dashes of cinnamon spice? Just callin it as I smell it.  Good grapefruit bite on the tongue without being overpowering. Pretty darn good balance for an IPA. Wondering if the hops have waned, as the keg indicates an April 15 date (best by??).  Fair amount of carbonation and decent dry bite on the mouthfeel.

10099,6108,jxhill,4.64,"Moderate bright white head. Clear amber color. Unmistakable sweet hoppy aromas of pine and (to a lesser extent) citrus but with a toasty, biscuity smell behind. This beer absolutely dances through the mouth, with a variety of hop flavors moving from front to back. Feel is full and chewy with a nice amount of hop spice. Flavor fades very evenly. Lots of lacing.  There's no use trying to hide it -- this is one of my very favorite beers. The continual 60-minute hopping for me is just a euphemism for the theory of this beer. Balance.  The separate characters of the bittering, aroma and dry hops are indistinguishable, and pass smoothly from one note to the next in the palate. Even the flavors of the different hops used are transposed. And unlike many other IPAs, which tend to be all oars and no boat, this IPA has a very strong but silent ""beer"" foundation with toasty and malty flavors which holds all 60-minutes of hops together. This beer sets a new bar, and sets it high.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,sarahspat,2.95,"Very clear golden color. Negligible white head. Tiny bit of lacing.  Smells of grapefruit and candied grapefruit. The potency of the nose diminishes greatly within the first few minutes, however, and is nearly impossible to detect after that point. Minor burnt notes.  Flavors: grapefruit, pine, burnt/roastiness. The hops are great, but the burnt flavors really not cute. I have had more than a few bottles of this beer over the years and it doesn't always have that burnt quality, but it's there often enough to cause me to regard this as a below average-tasting IPA. As far as I'm concerned, it (the burnt flavor) has no place in an IPA, and I don't think it complements the other flavors well at all. The finish is very bitter and contains powerful notes of citrus peel. There are also some notes of cooked vegetable after the swallow. 60 Minute is not a horrible beer, and often it is the only beer available that I would consider ordering. However, I can easily think of many more tasty IPAs. My conclusion: the main reason this beer is held in such high esteem is its relatively wide availability.  The body is light-medium, and a bit creamy. Plenty of carbonation to go around... almost too much; dries out your mouth.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,marvin213,2.36,"Among the most macro-looking of DFH beers, its foamy cap is its most impressive appearance feature. The beer is totally translucent and, even for an IPA, it looks watery. Let's face it--I got into beer advocacy and reviewing brews for the likes of 120 and Fort--not for relative weenies like this. Still, I'll keep in mind that this isn't trying to be those. For the most part, it's an average-looking beverage.  I don't really like the smell. It's oddly malty. It is an IPA, right? That's the same style as a Two-Hearted or a Green Flash West Coast. I suppose Two-Hearted more commonly squares up against 90min, but this here 60min doesn't offer up much in the way of odors. I smell more malty backbone than hoppy body and, for an IPA, that's subpar.  The taste is more like the smell than the look. It actually tastes malty. There's not that much to it. Other than a simmered-down ABV, why would you drink this instead of 90min? Besides, if you need to or want to tone it down, have a macro lager...or a pilsner. Though I love DFH and embrace their adventurous appeal to extremists (I'm enjoying this one out of my purchased DFH glassware), this single offering would leave me unimpressed with a brewery I know to be remarkable. It's really carbonated and more sweet than hoppy. It's homogenous and uniform-tasting throughout but, unfortunately, it's blah.  Mouthfeel is the best part of an otherwise ""okay"" beer. The malty sweetness and big brewery type of carbonation let this one tickle the tongue and cheeks. The aftertaste, however, leaves something to desire...like hop. I'm not always looking for a hop monster to rip my teeth apart when I reach for an IPA, but I do expect to feel some hop goodness. I don't, really. Though I like the citrusy touch more characteristic of West Coasters (and Two-Hearted), I don't always have to have that either. With the 60min, I'm nevertheless looking for something that's simply not here. Not only is it not a great beer, it's not a good beer. Even within a beer collection that includes something for everyone, there's no place for this 60min IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,MLasoski,3.52,"Presentation: Bottle poured into an ale glass.  A: Looks like what an IPA should be. A clear, tan, and moderately carbonated body leaves a 1/2 inch head which fades away quickly, leaving a bit of lacing behind.  S: Smells like hops and citrus, more of the former.  T: This tastes as it's advertised (hops continually added). It's not overbearing but it doesnt shortstraw you either.  M: Starts out simplistic, but once it hits the roof of the mouth, the hops are released and the beer finishes without a bitter aftertaste.  D: This makes me want to keep drinking IPA's. Dogfish Head has done this one right. I have already graduated myself to the 90 minute version and I hope to get my hands on the 75 minute and 120 minute varieties.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,prosper,3.82,"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow. CO2 'streamers' and a coarse white head that falls quickly, leaving some lace.  Smell is all hops. Dry hops; pineapple, pine, tropical fruit. perhaps some sweet malt, but that could just be my imagination. I'd hazard a guess that it's been dry hopped with Simcoe, from the pine; Amarillo, from the juicy tropical fruit; and Columbus from the pineapple. (Edit: from the clone recipes I've found, there are indeed Amarillo and Simcoe in there)  Taste is all late hops. Surprisingly few bitter IBU's, lots and lots of fruity hops, of the same character noted in the aroma. Some biscuity malt, becomes more apparent in the finish. Also some 'vegetal' pilsner-malt flavour. Very dry.  Thin body. too much carbonation. Prickly, slightly metallic.  Highly drinkeable. Thin body, clean finish, not hugely bitter, moderate ABV. Perfect 5.  Overall, I'd give it a 'ho-hum.' Acceptable, tasty, but I've had better.

The hops stick around on the back of the tongue, but its quite balanced, as expected from an East Coast IPA.  M&D - Perfect amount of carbonation, nice and dry on the tongue.

The taste is nothing I would get to excited about but it's pretty refreshing and pretty drinkable. A lower ABV and pretty drinkable and nothing to hoppy I think this is a good one to start a new craft drinker off with in the IPA category. For me I enjoy this one but I'd rather have a 90 minute or another stronger more hoppier IPA but this one is still good.

The earthy and floral hops really hit the tongue at the beginning. There is a hint of citrus in the middle but the bitter earthy hops take home the finish. Once my tongue is used to the hops the malt is a bit more detectable. There is a nice toasted malt flavor that balances out very well.

Very much falls into the Two Hearted Ale or Sierra Nevada Pale ale spectrum.  Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with a dry finish.

The best way to say this is very fresh aroma's floral,earthy.  Taste is again very hoppy that just smack you right in the mouth almost an overkill.Some maltiness comes into play but again immediately smashed down by the hops.  Mouth is very thin and watery but smooth and bubbly. Leaves a distinct coating in the mouth,buttery even.Light-medium bodied.

Grassy and floral.  Taste: More of an extreme English IPA. Lots of malt and grassy hops. This is definitely a slightly toned-down version of the 90 minute.  Mouthfeel: Not as syrupy as the 90 minute(thank god). Quite pleasant with excellent carbonation.  Drinkability: alrighty.  Overall: Not sure if this was slightly worn out from the long journey from Delaware to Vancouver, but this was not as hoppy strong as I thought it would be.

Aroma is a vibrantly intense blast of the piney grapefruit fix you showed up for. Earthy, rye bread-like malt backbone, neutral sweetness. Brief highlights of caramel.  Earthy, woody malt up front, dry toasted bread pleasantly balancing a bright citrus zing that is well contained. Beautifully balanced IPA.  Fuller end of medium-bodied mouthfeel, light and wet on the finish, though creamy smooth as well. Almost like the best of all worlds.  Greater than the sum of its parts, better than many IPA's out there, yet still noticably the younger sibling to the ramped up yet equally balanced 90 Minute IPA, even at 6% abv. this could still be a great cheater session beer.

Average amount of carbonation; a really nice balance.  D: Surprisingly high considering the 6%.  This is a fantastic pale ale.

Decent amount of lacing.  S - faint hop aroma, a little malty sweetness but not much else. The biggest gripe I have about this beer is the lack of hop aroma.  T - This is a very well balanced IPA. There is a decent amount of bitterness, but also a strong malt backbone that fills this beer out.  M - perfectly carbonated, this beer just seems at peace in your mouth. After you swallow, the bitterness lingers on the back of the tongue, but it is not overpowering.  D - Fantastic. This beer just goes down smooth and easy, not too sweet and not too hoppy.

Shows good retention and clung for dear life to the side of my glass.  A: Citrusy hops smell like white grapefruit, lemons, and a hint of orange peels with an herbal/floral vibe as well. Underneath is a malt presence that smells deeply toasted.  T: Right away, my palate is bombarded with hoppy flavors reminiscent of bitter lemons, followed by grapefruit pith, and a vague flavor of orange peel, with some resinous pine in the background. They impart their acidic bitterness on the palate in controlled doses, making it enjoyable but never over-the-top. The deeply toasted, caramel malt is biscuity and stays underneath, but doesn't do much to add any sweetness to the brew. I like my IPA's bitter, and this one is doing the trick. I just wish the flavor profile wasn't being dominated so heavily by the lemons.  M: The 60 minute IPA feels about right. It's medium-bodied, but has some heft to it. It's nicely carbonated with a crisp, clean, dry finish that sticks to the palate. Suits the beer well.  Notes: One thing is for sure, I like this a whole hell-of-a-lot better than it's bigger brother, the 90 minute IPA (which I thought was just way too sweet and malty). This one is much more bitter from the alpha acids and doesn't have too much of them pesky malts to get in the way. I do wish the lemony flavors didn't smother the other flavors so much, but this would make a good session beer, nonetheless.

(S)- A citrus bomb of lemon, lime, pineapple, grapefruit and even a tiny speck of peach. Hints of pine and malts way way in the background.  (T)- Big malt backbone of sweet citrus with a great hoppy dryness on the finish. Balanced with simple but good complexities. Even a touch of maple syrup in the background of the finish.  (M)- Creamy, dry, sweet, crisp, and balanced. Slightly syrupy in the texture yet damn refreshing.  (D)- A great AIPA that can be put away one after another.

10099,6108,SmithwicksNut,4.3,"If ever there was a beer that proved, for me at least, the rule that you should always check a beer twice before deciding that you don't like it, 60 Minute IPA is it. My first one last night was not an impressive experience. Today -- chagrined by the high reviews, wondering what I missed last night -- I popped open another, and found myself far more pleased than I had been. In fact, this has become one of my favorite IPAs.  The aroma is definitely piney; one would think the brewers had put a spruce branch through a juice extractor. Great, billowing, ""never say die"" head, and lacing that looks like it's trying to crawl up the inside of the glass.  Chewy mouthfeel, nice and creamy, great hops taste, nicely balanced with malt sweetness. This is a good beer, it makes you work for it, and unlike so many milder IPAs, every sip seems different, if only because you can choose to focus on a different aspect of its complexity every time.  Who knows what was wrong with my taste buds last night? I am just glad that I gave this beer another try. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The hops have citrus and piney character as far as I could tell, and they are plentiful.  There is a little bit of spicy, biscuity malt that manages to peek through the bitterness in the body, but it's minor and quickly fades to a pretty bitter finish that lingers a while.  Pretty aggressive for a standard IPA. For me, it's not the IPA I'd reach for first.

Poured a serious golden color with a great head that really hung around and laced the glass entirely. The aroma was straight up hops with nothing else much to it. The taste was an extremly clean IPA that was light and cramed with hops. The brew it's self was great and totally changed my mind on the 60 min itself. The mouthfeel was a little rough as to the amount of Hops but was not bad as to kill the taste buds.

I did not know what to do, but I again looked at the Dogfish Head label and realized it was going to be okay. I got it to pour a two finger white head, that left little to no lacing.  The smell was great, a oily hop smell that just screamed 'drink me'. It had a pine citrus smell, but really an oily thickness came off from the head that made me excited. So I drank it.  It is good, but not outstanding. I just liked it because it was a nice IPA that gave me a great hop citrus taste, but nothing outstanding. It had a good oily hop mouthfeel that was good.

Just enough carbonation to provide the right refreshing mouthfeel for a lighter IPA. A very drinkable IPA, one I would recommend especially to those still developing an appreciation for the style.

Smelled an earthy sort of hoppy. Mostly pine, with a bit or orange and/or grapefruit rind.  Strong, earthy and cirtrusy ops hit you up front, and at first I thought they were going to take over the whole brew. Not so. The biscuity malts come through very well and it ends up being very well balanced. Even the aftertaste is well balanced. The carbonation was good and paired with the alcohol, they warmed the tongue and the belly.  The beer is bursting with flavor and is what I would consider to be a classic American IPA.

Smell: A bit of floral earthy hop character. I get a whift of burnt coffee. The foam on this beer holds back the aromas but nothing a little shake wont stir up.  Taste: This is bitter, not a very pleasing bitterness from my tastes. The malt is subdued by the hops only a touch of sweetness. I pick up maybe a bit of cheesiness from the hops and bitterness. Not a lot of character but for the style its right on.  Mouthfeel: I wouldnt call it thick, maybe just a bit under. Carbonation is a bit low. Maybe a little more would be good just to push the hop aromas.  Drinkability: For the money I could find a better I.P.A. The unpleasent bitterness kind of lingers. I find myself taking another just to try and wash it away. The style of this is right on. But the hops employed on this one are not my cup of tea.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,originalsin,4.07,"Poured into a Stone Pint glass. I had a bottle of this for the first time yesterday and I'm fairly certain it suffered from oxidation: the after taste was disgusting wet cardboard. I'm really hoping it was just the bottle.  A: A somewhat hazy light amber color yields a decent amount of off-white head that dissipates quickly to leave a light ring around the beer- it laces mildly well.  S: Hops, of course! Lots and lots of floral and citrus hops all balanced out by sweet malt.  T: This beer comes on with a big sweet hop kick to the mouth: it's almost a little sweet at first but that's ok: the hop flavors are delicious. Woohoo! No wet cardboard taste this bottle. I'm relieved. Grapefruit flavors come through and are then complemented by a nice sweet malt aftertaste that lingers.  M&D: It's a medium bodied beer with relatively light carbonation for the style. Of course, this is a very drinkable IPA and certainly something I'll make a point to keep stocked in the fridge.  Once again, DFH delivers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,NightINgale,4.74,"A: Orange/amber body with some bubbles. The off-white head is rather plentiful at first, then dissipates up to a point where you get about a millimetre of foam. Looks nice. Decent head retention and lovely lacing.  S: Gives out a very floral, pine aroma, with plenty of citrus and some malts.  T: This beer bursts with flavour. A spectacular hoppy bite takes lead at first, followed by some significant sweetness and some biscuit-type malts. The finish is bitter, but the bitterness isn't too sharp and is rather pleasant. Any hop-head should be able to adore this beer! Although it is very hoppy, the malts still play a significant role, making this beer well-balanced.  M: Ligh-to-medium body (closer to medium). Very smooth and yet crisp. The flavour is bursting, and it is clear that the ingredients the Dogfish brewers use are high-quality.  D: Goes down very smooth. I would recommend against having more than 2 bottles at a time, but this is a wonderful IPA!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,SickBrew,3.53,"The brew pours a deep yellow with some hints of amber. Head is a bit week and quickly subsides. Only a few wispy rings of lace are left behind. Nose is a bit faint and a somewhat grassy. Flavor follows nose and although the flavor is decent, the grassy tones tend to dominate. Malt backbone is also a bit weak for the grassy flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit slimy, if that makes sense and the carbonation could be a bit greater. Overall the beer is just OK for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,morebeergood,3.85,"Grabbed a pint on tap at O'Leary's on Beacon Street. Orange color with a hint of yellow. Nice white head. Good amount of carbonation. Smell was a bit peppery. Taste was quite pleasing for a non-IPA lover. There were hops, sure, but it did not overwhelm the beer. There was also a nice grapefruit aspect to the flavor that made it quite refreshing. This is one of the first IPAs that I have had in a while that I would consider having a second. Smooth going down and very easy to drink.

Taste is clean and nicely malted. The hops come on at the end, not too bitter. Closer to the floral range of the hops. An excellent blend of hops and malts for a great IPA.  Mouthfeel is nice and light. A small bitter taste from the hops but nothing overpowering. You could drink this as a session beer.  A great example of an American IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BDLbrewster,3.7,"The brew pours with a big white head that fades rather quickly. Color is a dark orange...almost a pumpkin-pie color. I love the aroma....it hits you as soon as you open the bottle. Super floral, fresh, and grassy....I can't get enough of the smell. After the first few sips, which are full-force hops, this beer really does mellow out. Subtle malts pull through in the mid-taste. You get the rough flavor of the hop additions, but not the intensity that destroys your palate. It's really remarkable to get so much flavor though the onslaught of hops. Drinkable, and extremely enjoyable. Don't usually do this for a review, but the sixer went down nicely.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,drtth,4.02,"Chilled and poured into a standard shaker/pint glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: This beer pours out a clear dark amber/orange color with a 1"" off-white head that recedes reasonably slowly and leaves some sheets and leggy patches of lacing on the sides. Even mid way through the beer theres still a layer of foam on the surface and foam clinging to the sides of the glass.. Sipping leaves small patch of lacing on the side.  Smell: The aroma is predominantly floral grapefruit and maybe a hint of pine, all of which is followed by the sweet malt.  Taste: The flavor is initially sweet malt but is then quickly followed by the bitterness of the citrus hops (predominantly grapefruit) with a touch of pine. Both ares supported by the sweetness of the malt backbone that re-emerges briefly towards the end and then fades to lightly bitter dryness.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation. The finish is medium long and tapers off to a dry bitter citric end.

Some grains, and a clean hop finish buzz. Very well balanced, if slightly lackluster.  M-Well balanced overall.  D-This is a pretty drinkable beer, probably sessionable, and you can easily do a few back to back.  I liked this. It was a pretty basic and generic IPA and I would definately buy it again. The only drawback is that it was a bit ho hum. Reminds me very much of Sierra Nevada, and there is nothing wrong with that.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Good looking surface of the beer with bubbles of varying size.  Smell - fine malt scent with hoppy aroma, light citrusy-spice notes in there as well.  Taste - good flavour profile, creamy malt flavour at the beginning, giving way to a powerful throb of hop bitterness. Notable for even flavour, and packs a nice continuous whollap of bitters throughout.  Mouthfeel - definitely active by way of the bitters and moderate carbonation, but definitely interesting and a good ride each sip!  Drinkability - one of these at a time is fine. I could do 2. Definitely enjoyable, I just don't want to get messed up on a bunch of these, which I know I would because even at 6% I could pound away on these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Very nice soapy lacing that lasts till the end.  Smell: A light citrus smell overwhelmed by hops and malt.  Mouth feel is highly carbonated but non-abrasive.  Taste: Taste is citrusey and floral but with a bitter bite from the hops. This taste is followed by the distinct taste of alcohol.  Drinkability: Overall impression is good. While nothing necessarily struck out as unique about the taste, that is not a bad thing. The taste has no oddities no unpleasentries to it, just the taste of a properly brewed beer and the bitterness from an IPA. I must say this one is light enough and desirable enough to drink quickly and be poised for another one. People have called this a session beer however the alcohol content maybe a a bit too high at 6% for a light weight like me it wouldn't take too many of them to make me a lil tipsy.

Smells malty, which stands out more than the citrus like hop aroma. Hops kind of hang out in the back, but still present. Malts also stand out in the taste category, more pronounced than the hops, but I think it is a great balance between the two, nothing overpowering. Mouthfeel is good, feels very light and not overly carbonated, almost reminding me of a light beer, but one that actually has flavor. I'd rate the drinkability high on this one, taste is good and the low alcohol content make it easy to handle a couple, should you choose to do so.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The smell is fairly light with a good amount of malt and hops, with the latter being more prevalent. Great citrus scent with a little amount of pine. Tastes incredible - a crisp sweet and citrus taste. There is some bitterness in the aftertaste, but not as biting as the 90 minute. Very good. The brew has a light to medium-sized mouthfeel with not much carbonation and its very easily drinkable.

10099,6108,MeisterBurger,4.1,"Pours a clear golden brown with a lofty head than sticks around.  The smell is more toasty malt than anything else, but if you must know that anything else is somewhat grassy barely grapefruity hops and a decent amount of caramel.  The taste is pretty mellow for an IPA, and there's a wetness to the mouthfeel which is good and yet seems out of place. Unlike a lot of lesser American IPAs you can taste the hops themselves more than just the bitterness of the alpha acids. Not sure if that is a good thing without the bitterness though. There's some mild tangerine going on with a hint of honey. There's toasted malts mostly with, yeah. Caramel malt. Heh. Is it possible to review an American IPA without the words ""pine"", ""grapefruit"" and ""caramel""? You tell me. I've yet to find a way.  As judged on its own merits it's a delicious and surprisingly refreshing and pleasant beer. But as an American IPA it could probably do with a heavier dose of hops early in the boil to bring up the bitterness that might bring it up to the level of it's counterparts. But I guess that would go against the whole concept of this beer. So maybe not.  This is a great and easily sessionable beer and let's just say it's an IPA, but it's an off-centered IPA as it was intended to be, and no bad thing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The malts give the hops some backbone, it's well balanced in terms of the hops--I can't say whether it's ""spicier"" or more ""citrusy,"" it seems to have both, just overall goes down real smooth with enough delicious lingering bitterness for you to think ""Damn, this is a 60 minute IPA.""

Poured to an American pint glass.  Pours a clear copper tinted gold, with a little more than 2 fingers of white head that rises above the rim of the glass, but never fell over. Head settles to a frothy one finger foam.  Ripe red grapefruit in the nose balanced out by a malty backbone. Smells really nice.  At first sip I really notice that ""house Dogfish"" flavor that all their beers seem to have. The six pack holder notes that it is ""one of the closest approximations of cask ale in a bottle"" and I get that from this beer. There is a slight alcohol warmth that is there throughout each sip in the beginning.  About halfway through, the malts (bready) and hops (citrus) start to balance everything out and the beer gets very drinkable. The house character seems to subside and let the beer breathe. All the flavors of this beer are subtle, but they all blend wonderfully together.  Slowly, 60 minute is becoming one of my favorite IPA's.

Smell: Grapefruit, herbal hops, toasted malts, and earth. Kind of woody and a bit salty.  Taste: Lots of toasted malt with piney hop resin taking over in the finish. Not very bitter especially for the style. Lime and grapefruit make up the citric quotient. Still getting a bit of salt. Some caramel in the beginning too. Bitterness picks up toward end of session, but is still mild. Definitely unique, but seems a bit lacking.

Smell is terrible. I do get some intense piney/spruce hops and touch of caramel, I'm overwhelmed by a skunky smell. I really cant put my finger on it, but its not nice. Taste wasnt bad, but again I hope this was a bad batch. It had some nice hop bitterness, with a touch of citrus, and it had a good malt backbone, more of a dryer malt. But still, something just a little off. Mouthfeel was fine, but a less than appealing aftertaste left behind. Overall not the best. I bought a 6 pack and took me about 10 days to drink all of them, trust me...thats not normal.

Not enough hops for an American IPA.  Mouth feel: Smooth medium bodied beer that tingle the tip and sides of the tongue.

Always a pleasure enjoying anything Dogfish Head brews. This one is no exception. Great golden color with a nice white foamy head. Great lacing that seems to last an eternity.  Great smell of floral and spice which is brought to reality with the same taste. Still like to identify a few of the undertones in the DFH brews...seems to be in quite a few of them.  Only ting I didn't rate a 4.5 on this brew was the appearance. I gave it a 4 as I would with any fine filtered IPA, but I really do enjoy an unfiltered IPA, or bottle conditioned.

I love everything about it except that It's not available in my region(yet?!?).  It's got a golden-honey color with a pencil-thin head. Smell is perfect with a nice hop sting in the nose. Where this beer really shines is its taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability, all are off the charts. I'm hard-pressed not to give this all 5's. It was very worthwhile for me to have sought this out.

Smelled of macro sugar ick at first pour--this seemed to die down with the head. Wet, earthy light grains under herbal hops. Peppery.  Consistant, mild hop bitterness--fairly light for an IPA. Primarily a heavy herbal hop oil with miserable grainy, sugary malt. Grapefruit rind hopiness here and there.  By far the best part of this beer is the lingering hop oil. It's like hop take-out; one can take a sip and bring hop taste with him/her for hours. Mouthfeel is oily and crisp, almost champagnish--like Miller High Life.  I hear tell that many Dogfish Head beers are underattenuated--I wonder if that's the macro ick that pervades this beer?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Buschyfor3,3.94,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a 14 oz mug  A: pours a deep golden/faint orange hue with a foamy white head, 1 finger thick; tiny bubbles percolating up the side of the glass; slight lacing clings to the side of the glass.  S: first notes are citrusy (grapefruit, orange); floral, herbal hoppy notes; also picking up woodsy notes of pine, maybe cedar. Overall, the aroma was not as pronounced (perhaps it would be better to say pungent?) as the Stone IPA which I tried a couple days prior.  T: hoppy bitterness followed by citrusy, rind-like flavors; slight sweetness from the citrus fruit, yet it is balanced by peppery, herbal and wood flavors; slight malty, biscuit flavor peaks through after the initial hoppy outburst; finish reminds me a lot of a dry wine, leaves a hint of cottonmouth that begs for another sip.  M: carbonation is crisp and tingly, but creates a slightly slick mouthfeel; carbonation fits what you would expect from such an up-front, citrusy/hoppy ale.  D: 6% ABV isn't too powerful, but the alcohol does establish itself with a bit of peppery flash; however, I think this IPA is relatively easy to drink because it didn't try to wreck my palate like my experience with other IPAs.  Still early days in my foray into IPAs, but that being said, the 60min IPA definitely feels like a good intro IPA.

10099,6108,TheHammer,2.02,"Appearance: Got this one in a trade with ludachris, thanks man. Came in a cyan and olive bottle with a picture of what I assume is a dogfish on it. Cloudy gold/yellow color that poured with a finger of head that laces decently and retains quite well. However, the beer itself also seems to have some carbonation issues at first glance as I'm not see very much of it.  Smell: Overpowering smell of citrus hops on this one which isn't surprising given the style, however it's way out of control. A lot of dry, hay like smell mixed with mild pine needles too. The strength is perfect, and it's not unpleasant but this is setting alarms off in my head that this beer is going to be way too dry and bitter.  Taste: Well my predictions via the smell were correct. It starts with a hay like flavor and then turns to a slight touch of grapefruit near the middle that is annihilated by the bitterness till the end by a taste I can only describe as dry hops mixed with burnt, dried pine needles. WAY too bitter for my tastes, and the only reason I don't grade it lower, is because I'm to understand a large amount of bitterness is normal for the style.  Mouthfeel: Leaves a god awful bitter aftertaste that leaves the mouth as dry as a bone. It's carbonation is surprisingly decent, but the problem is in only serves to enhance the terrible taste. Also, it is abundantly clear that this beer has a high alcohol content. Honestly, if it wasn't for the fact I'm not catching any sort of chemical flavor, I'd rate this a 1.  Drinkability: Well I find the taste and the feeling it leaves in my mouth to hamstring it's drinkability. It's carbonation makes it lack smoothness, and it's dryness doesn't make you feel refreshed at all. Thankfully it is decent on the gut, but that's not saying much. I can't finish this beer, which is always a bad sign.  Edit: After 10 minutes after drinking, I got a vicious case of gut rot, making this my first 1 score in the field of drinkability  Final Thoughts: Having never had a IPA outside of Alexander Keith's (which I know isn't a good example of the style) I thought I'd give this stuff a try. If this is an A- beer for the style, then this style must not be for me. I drain poured this at the halfway mark it was so god awful. The only redeeming quality is the smell, and there is more to a beer then a nice aroma. There is no balance to this beer, the bitter and dry nature is out of control. It's very rare I have a beer that completely puts me off of a style, but this stuff does it. I'm more inclined to try another Japanese style beer sooner then another IPA because of this beer.

Piney cascade dominates the aroma but there's a hint of some citrusy juicyness. Comes off very light though with a slightly toasted malt background.  Taste is dominated by the bitter pine contribution with a slick Boston Lager-type vienna malt finish. Very spicy and bold without being excessively bitter. I'd like to drink this with some very hot Thai food. Not exactly a West-coast style IPA or a British IPA.. or even a standard American IPA.. very unique.  Mouthfeel retains the ""real ale"" feel which I'm always a fan of. I think this would be really great on cask or on tap as just an easy drinking IPA.  Maybe underrated for its uniqueness but overrated for its overall flavor. The hop flavor does not linger, but the toasted malt flavor does. Both are good together but don't form anything exciting together. I guess I went into the review expecting more in the way of hop flavor and character and maybe a little more complexity or something that would stick out.

The smell has a ""green"", earthy quality to it that I really dig.  T- Clean and refreshing hop bitterness is balanced out by a very small amount of sweet-tasting malt. The dry finish leaves a pithy bitterness lingering on the back of the tongue.  M- A full-bodied feel with mild carbonation.  D- A great, sort of balanced, flavor of hops with a low ABV.

10099,6108,dwarvenspirits,4.42,"I've had this beer in the past and I wasn't impressed with it. I think it was because the beer was a little old. Having one that is one month from bottle date makes a world of difference.  Beautiful clear deep golden color. Head forms fast and dies fast but leaves some lacing in the glass. Smells of mint, citrus and pine all mixed into one. Hop bitterness slams into the palate followed by some quick dryness and then the hop flavor of what I'm guessing is simcoe hops. Finishes dry with no hint of malt.  This is almost a perfect beer for the style. I wish it had just a touch more balance with some malt but it's still a wonderful beer to have available at all times.

The head seems to last a long time in this one. A beautiful lace chases it down.  S: Some pine, some citrus, some grassiness from the hops. What really shines here is the bready, sweet maltiness. This is something I really miss in an IPA.  T: Bready sweetness from the malts initially. Then the hops set in. First I get a grassy, citrus flavor. This trends to a grapefruit/piney bitterness towards the end. Not overly bitter however. The flavor really seems quite well balanced. The hops are a little lighter than others in this style, but I suspect if I had a fresher sample, I would say otherwise. Really quite flavorful.  M: Crisp, clean, bubbly. Finishes slightly dry.  D: This was definitely worth the hype. In a world with unbalanced IPAs, this brings you back to the middle. I really like how the hops and malts mingle.

Full floral impact hits late palate with managable bitterness.  M - A little too flat and thick for my tastes, perhaps this is a result of it being on draught.

Citrus hop taste w/ a nice malt backbone. I had this a bit too warm which is making the alcohol very pronounced.  Medium to heavy carbonation. The well balanced malt and hops make this easily drinkable (especially for an IPA).  Good easy drinking and well balanced.

I can smell pine/spice and citrus in the nose.  Nice citrusy hop flavor that finishes up very smooth and sweet.  This is a crisp and clean ipa. Tasty and fresh.

S: Faint pine on top of moderate hops along with a bready malt. Kind of weak overall, not strong scented by any means.  T: This is a very malty IPA lots of malt with bread along with some caramel toffee notes. Small finish of hops along with a pine bite that becomes increasingly more bitter with warmth. This is an interesting one.  Overall: Decent carbonation but could use a bit more it's light-medium in body. Pretty drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

S - Floral hops and sweet toasty cereal grain on the nose. Not like adjuncts, but like fresh toasted wheat or oats. Gets a tad boozy as it warms up.  T - Good amount of hops and hop bitterness, well balanced with a dash of citrus and sweetness.  M - High carbonation compliments the slightly weighty mouthfeel.  D - Actually pretty drinkable for an IPA. The bitter resin of the hops gets a bit strong as one drinks, but I could see myself enjoying a couple of these with dinner.  Overall - A nicely balanced IPA; tastes like it would go really well with food.

10099,6108,andrewgator,4.06,"Appearance is typical for an IPA maybe slightly redish. Poured into a pint glass with a decent head and great lacing.  The aroma suprised me. Not the typical cascade hop smell in other IPA's has more of a earthy floral hop aroma that really got me excited to taste it.  The taste is very well balanced not to heavy on the bittering hops and if finishes with perfect balance. I wasn't expecting as much malt flavor. The ringwood yeast gives it an interesting cedar note, and leaves a slight hint of diacetyl.  The drinability is great although maybe a little bit too carbonated for my taste. All in all this is a new favorite and a great choice at run of the mill grocery stores and liqour stores.  I have been in the dark and not tried this beer till now. Way better than I expected.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Taste was a bit of a let down for this style. The hop bite up front was nice, but the end of the taste was a little watered down. I guess you could say there wasn't much of a finish. The carbonation is a great level which good amount of bubbles in the glass.

Nice deep bronze color and a huge white head like ocean foam. The aroma is not as overpowering as many of the other I.P.A.s I've had. Much more subtle aromas of pine and citrus. Almost an earthy plant kind of smell. It tastes more malty than I had expected. Not to say that malty is one of the top characteristics of this beer, because it's not, it just has a sweeter type of malty taste than I expected. The flavor is very mild. I detect the bitterness from hops and the piney aftertaste and just barely a hint of citrus fruit. Nice almost creamy texture and medium body. Pretty easy drinking. The beer is now 3/4 gone and foam residue is stuck to the wall of the glass and refuses to dissappear. This is a pretty easy drinking six-percenter. A mild I.P.A....

It lets some light through and straddles the line nicely between being too hazey or too light. The beer had a nice 1 finger head.  The smell is decent for this IPA. Great notes of hop and light amounts of citrus make this really pleasing to see.  The taset is phenomenal. The right mix of hop and refreshing flavor. One of the better IPAs on the market.  Playing around the mouth, this beer feels great. Nice amounts of flavor felt around the mouth with a over all light body.  This beer has great drinkability. Its really easy to get into a few of these during a beer tasting session.  Final Thoughts - I would definitely call this my standard IPA if it wasnt for the price. Great beer overall.

Solid lacing on this beer from the heavy hop load.  Smell Picking up all kinds of florals mixed with citrus and honey.  Taste Very hoppy both up front and to the back of the tongue. Complex sweetness and bitterness throughout. Mild citrus rind permeates the bitterness.  Mouthfeel Decent carbonation and slightly thick, quickly dries out on the tongue.  Drinkability Goes down very easily. The initial sip is very quenching but dries quickly, begging for another sip.  Overall A staple IPA to have around, to be certain. Not as complex as the 90 or 120 minute varieties, but a solid if not monster IPA in and of itself.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,alkemy,4.3,"Poured into a pint glass, I would describe the color as a slightly light amber. The scent is of grapefruit, orange, and pine...all the prereq's for a great IPA. I loved that the hops taste was balanced perfectly between the citrus and pine. It often seems that these two flavors tend to lean too far to one side. The beer leaves nice lacing, although I didn't realize it until the conclusion of my very short tasting. Although I could have just been thirsty, this beer went down quick! Taste was superbly balanced and easy to drink and with the lower ABV, I can see why Dogfish refers to it as ""the session beer for hardcore beer enthusiasts""",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,biegaman,3.68,"An icy complexion of the pan-fried pancake; its golden glossing looks crisp and tasty. Haze interrupts clarity but the beer still appears filtered and clean. Head retention is ample and the white paste adorning its top seems insistent on leaving thin strands of itself behind. If you order an IPA this is exactly what you hope to see served.  American IPA's are illustrious for their bold, brazen pageantry of hops. Although this example is intended to show a little more restraint than its bigger brother the 90 Minute IPA, it still manages to be quite the spectacle with pungent, earthy hop cones being on full display. That said, a strong biscuity malt underlines and assures us there will be balance.  Perhaps more so than expected. The flavour is about as malty as hoppy, I'd call it a coin flip. Although I love the taste of this ultra-biscuity, super chewy cookie dough flavour, I'm a little surprised that all the pungent, green, earthy hop character has been reserved for the finish only. This doesn't have quite the vibrancy of citrus or spice as do other offerings.  The emphasis on hops is quite apparent but seems to result, in part, from a skimping out on malt. This tastes very malty, to be sure, but it feels a little on the light side and the hops are now starting to make for a lightly acidic, astringent mouthfeel. Working my way through the bottle I'm beginning to sense it could stand to use a little more base (for textural purposes) to support the hop acidity and bitterness.  The 60 Minute is my least favourite of Dogfish Head's hoppy trio and it has nothing to do with the fact this is a lower strength beer. Not entirely for subjective personal taste either, although that surely has a lot to do with it. It's because I've found a lot of inconsistency bottle to bottle and quite simply, I've come across many better crafted IPA's.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

I did however pay $15 for it, which is $3 more than my usual Maudite 6 pack.  I was thirsty when I got home so I popped a bottle open without refrigerating so serving temp is probably 65-70.  A: poured into a Guinness pint gives a bright one finger head that sticks around and leaves some nice lacing even in my dirty glass  S: Nice hop aroma: citrus; lemon and grapefruit. smells really sweet. Slight alcohol twinge. some roasted malt in there too.  T: Excellent malt backbone to the hop presence. This is wonderfully balanced. The hop bitterness lingers for about a minute after your sip but its not overpowering and intense.  M: quite thick but the carbonation keeps things afloat in the mouth without letting it get too sticky. It does stick to the teeth and mouth a bit though so I took .5 off for that.  D: I'm glad I have 5 of these left and I think this will be even better once it reaches 55 degrees or so.  I'm not a huge IPA fan but this beer has opened my eyes a bit to how balanced one can be.

Some malts in the background, but is overpowered by the hops. Unbalanced, but who cares the hops are great.  Medium bodied, carbonated maybe a little bit dry, but crisp.  I like the 90 minute better, but at $9.99 for a 6-pack when you pay the same price for only a 4-pack of 90 min.

S: Had some good floral scents with hints of grapefruit, pineapple, and pine. However, after a few minutes I started noticing something that reminded me of peat or an Islay scotch, which is disconcerting for an IPA.  T: Clean bitterness. Crisp. Not as much of the fruit or citrus as I had initially smelled or than I had hoped for (or that they had hopped for?). However, the pine was still there (although nothing crazy like Sierra's Torpedo). Just general dry hop bitterness more than anything else. Very little malt or alcohol taste.  M: Good medium bodied, clean IPA. Nothing particularly noteworthy here other than it's good.

I found it initially a bit of a strange beast, especially in the aroma, but it seems to have found its niche with me. I'm still impressed with the drinkability of this beer, it's clean and refreshing and I can knock a couple of them back with ease. Something about the smell and taste turned me off in my first review, but the clean, fresh hoppiness of this beer has become something I can certainly live with.

It is kind of biscuity and hops flavors are difficult to identify.  D: Very astringent and palette killing despite not having the very present hops flavors I enjoy.

One day I got a wild hair up my ass and bought a 6-pack of this one summer, years ago. I never enjoyed a bud light since then.  I feel lucky that this was my first voyage into microbrewing, because it is a phenomenal beer. I've come a long way since I bought that first 6 pack, but it is still the standard for me. This is the best ~6% IPA on the market. No IPA matches it's drinkability while still being complex and aggressive.

PAs and IPAs are unmistakable...and are similar in characteristics. the hard part is discerning the many differences, quite subtle. this is just as astounding as good ole SNevada PA...but they control completely different domains of the known universe. this really informs me that i need to educate myself on the characteristics of different hops, how they are used, when they are thrown in, how often, how much...  m-somehow i am dumbstruck. i can't untangle the taste from the mouthfeel. it was a seamless experience from the first sip. this is a first. even though a layer of foam lingers at the top half way down the british pint glass, i get thick cereal and that continuous palate-to-olfactory oscillation of hoppy ambience with unexpected, generously given stabs of bitterness. whew!  d-i'd session this, easily...but i would like to slalom and session this and two other PA/IPAs...just to train the tasting apparatus to hone in on the subtle differences. out of nowhere, i can see this making friends with manchego cheese and walnuts. but for now i am content to knock this out as it is. congrats DFH, again. i hope the 90 minute proves as astounding. or moreso...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

More ""woody"" aroma and bitter taste than the Libery Ale, Odell, Goose Island and Bridgeport IPAs. It gets better with each taste, but overall give me the other ones anyday.

10099,6108,KenC411,4.34,"Appearance A tan beer with few bubbles capped with a thin head barely hiding the beer below. The head forms no peaks. As the beer is consumed, a thick lace clings to the mug.  Smell The smell of hops and a hint of orange rind beckon me to consume it.  Taste An initial hop bite swirled with an orange flavor dance in the mouth. A slight coffee taste is also noted.  Mouthfeel The beer is almost cream-like, coating the tongue and palate its medium fullness and then lingering with a hoppy aftertaste.  Drinkability The beer goes down easily, and is exceptionally tasty.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Somewhat mild on aroma for an IPA, followed but various notes of toffee/malt/citrus T - 5.0 - Malty hop balance. Spot on for a very enjoyable IPA in my opinion.

Taste is a combination of big, malty body, bread and biscuit, not overly sweet, combined with the firm pine and citrus hit of the hops at the end, though the bitterness waits to come on in the finish.

A- 60 minute pours out a bronze golden color with a 3/4 inch white head that stayed up for a few minutes. A skim of foam remains at the surface leaving spotty lace. I can see through the glass, not hazy.  S- The continuous hop method shows its colors here as i get a lot of hops giving of more floral aroma's then citrus, Some malt that gives off bready aromas, some yeast.  T- Starts off with a nice cookie like taste from the malts backed by some slight bitter hop action. A switch from the usual. Some citrus flavors all around with a earthy finish somewhat grassy.  M- Light to semi medium body with good carbonation. An equal mix of malts and hops make this an easy drinker. No trace of alcohol with a bit of a metallic taste in the end while finishing dry.  D- Very drinkable and session worthy at a nice price. One of the more drinkable beers out of the DFH lineup. This is not as good as I thought it was 5+ years ago when i loved it. Perhaps my palette changed or the recipe has, or a bad bottle. Anyway give this one a go",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

More of an orangey hop nose with notable sweetness.  Taste is pleasant and slightly bitter yet not overwhelming in any regard. Rather viscous in feel and with an oily sweetness.

Not outstandingly complex, but this kind of reminds me of an old school IPA.  M- A nice carbonation level is a nice hoppy oiliness and dryness on the tail end.

Big foamy off-white head.  Big citrus/hop presence in the nose. Grapefruit, tangerine, orange, and big-time pine.  Bitter grapefruit taste, but tons of sweetness from the citrus and malts to balance it out. Slight lingering bitter aftertaste.  Medium bodied and refreshing.

10099,6108,CreamyStoutMan,3.97,"Doesn't look like anything special when poured into my glass. No head or lacing. Pretty much reminds me of the way any old domestic pilsner looks apart from being slightly darker  Smells hoppy as hell; no surprise. something fruity there as well. I can't describe it to a T, but it's definetely citrus. A hint of grapefruit possibly?  This is pretty much everything that I want in an IPA, tastewise. The malts are very subtle, but definetely are dominated by the hops, which are like an onsluaght and stick around for awhile after the last sip of the beer. There is that distinct intital sweetness before the hop earthquake on the palate. Thereis a point, right before the intensly hoppy ipa finish that reminds me a lot of a british ESB kind of a thing. This ones sharp and smooth with an appropriate bite.  I could drink a whole lot of these, but one is perfect with some spicy curry as well. I doubt I would choose to drink with this one without the appropriate food, but it seems to be one of those that you don't wanna stop drinking once you've gotten the right start",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

A bit non-descript.  Medicinal, not very much good hop character. Too bitter for the lack of hop profile. Not terrible, but not good, and nowhere near as good as the 90 minute.  Nice and clean palate. Good carbonation. A bit thin, but smooth.  The off/medicinal/bitter flavors don't help this one go down.  Unfortunately the best part about this was the appearance.

The head is offwhite and leaves an impressive curtain of lacing. The smell is (surprise) citrus and not overpowering. The taste is outstanding, just what an IPA should be. Strong hop presence without killing the palate with bitterness. For this reason, the mouthfeel is very good. The drinkability is also great.

Poured into my Penn State Pint glass, It pours a very high carbonated clear pale orange. The white head rests at 2 fingers and dissipates rather quickly. All in all, this beer looks like a pretty easy drink.  The smell is on the light side. Some floral and citrus notes are the most prevalent characteristics. Some grains and very light caramels are apparent as well.  The taste is dry but refreshing. A very nice bite from the citrus and dry hops. Very clean sip and finish. Not a hop bomb, but hops trounce on every other aspect of this beer in a good way. Some nice lemon flavors are noticeable.

10099,6108,douggoodavage,4.47,"Serving: 12oz bottle served in a pint glass at 50 degrees F. I believe when people serve beer too cold you miss out on the scent, taste & head.  Appearance: Light amber color with a one inch thick head when poured firmly into the glass at 50*F. Nice lacing and carbonation. Slightly cloudy from the dissolved solids.  Smell: Great with loads of hops, pine , nuts and unusual coffee hints.  Taste: Awesome bitter hops, crisp citrus , juniper / pine dryness. Thick juicy malt balance takes second place to the victorious hops.  Mouthfeel: Crisp refreshing medium light body. Wakes up your tongue with its tangy hops and nice carbonation.  Drinkability: Refreshing and easy to drink. Pairs very well with most foods.  The flavor is complex and satisfying. A very unique IPA one of my favorite refrigerator guests.

Taste of mildly citrusy hops that give to a small malty character. Not high in ABV so it is easy to drink more than a few. Very good session beer. Not as strong as 90 min but still quite tasty. I highly recommend it to everyone who hasn't had it before. Cheers",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Some moderate lace down the glass.  S= Aroma was a nice blend of bakery malt and floral, citrusy hops. Some pine in the hops as well. Fruity esters were there but fairly muted.  T= Lots of ""West Coast"" hop character, with base bitterness taking second seat to the pine and grapefruit/citrus notes. Though this is definitely a hop forward beer, the malts were always there providing a balancing caramel sweetness. Finish was dry with a hint of nutty flavor.  MF= This one is light to medium bodied with a nice crisp feel.  D= A classic American IPA with lots of hops and solid flavors throughout. Pairs well with smoked foods, pizza, barbecue, etc. Highly sessionable and very much recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,gabeerfan,4.32,"Pours a nice, clear golden yellow with a nice white head. It's an IPA, so the hops are the first aromas. Grapefruit and pine followed by a nice bicuity, toasted bread malt. Citrus and pine hops also come first in the flavor with the bicuity, toasted bread malts. No real sweetness, but the malts help balance the hops pretty well. Medium-light bodied. A little oily from the hops. Very drinkable. Nice flavors and a low enough ABV to drink a few of and not be dragged out of the bar. A very good IPA and it's pretty much one of my standards at the bar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,cratez,4.25,"Poured out of a 355ml bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance: dark golden, almost copper in colour with a thin, bubbly white head. Sticky lacing speckles the glass after the first few sips. Lots of active carbonation.  Smell: ridiculously fresh hops impart a light and fruity citrus aroma.  Taste: toasty and biscuity pale malts, lemon, citrus, and a dry, piney hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Good nutty flavours with a bit of sweetness as well.  Mouthfeel: crisp and smooth upfront, tangy and oily body with a drying finish.  Overall: Dogfish Head has done an excellent job of distinguishing this IPA from others. The pronounced bitterness, beautiful biscuit/hop symmetry, and distinct citric finish make this an ideal session beer. At $14.95 a six pack, I'm glad I got my money's worth.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BuffaloTapHugger,4,"This was one of the first beers that made me a hophead. With that notion being said, a little disappointment does emerge.  A: A slightly dark golden orange haze color.  S: Hops are a plenty! (citrus/pine)  T: The bite is there, but still lacks the overall concept of the essence and the getup. A medium bodied hoped beer with some malt in toe.  M: The gulp factor is highly present. A great session beer by all means.  D: This is a gateway brew... Once you get your hop fix, you may never go back to drinking conventional beers again. I do recommend and I will have another.  The point is that I once put this beer on a pedestal, now i just return it for the five cents.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Pine, citrus, hops... that's about it.  T- This is the way I feel an IPA should taste. Very clean and refreshing. Nice hop and citrus flavor that is not very overpowering.  M- Pretty light IPA. Moderate carbonation.  D- The most drinkable Dogfish Head that I've had so far. I like the 90 minute's taste better, but this one is much easier to drink. A good session beer.

S - Nice pine, some citrus and grass. A bit muted, though. Not as bright and pungent as I'd like.  T - Some pine and citrus, but lots of breadiness and pale male. Some light fruitiness, but it just doesn't really do it for me.  M - Nice mouthfeel, moderate carbonation.  D - Goes down easily. This is a good IPA to drink with food and not have to pay much attention to.

Pours just like an IPA should, Lovely golden brown color with a foamy head that leaves a good lace on the glass. Smells mostly of hops with some citrus notes. Tastes the same, maybe a bit of malt comes through in the middle. In my opinion its a bit heavy on hops flavor, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. Very drinkable brew. Cant wait to try the 90 minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,stockingcpl,4.2,"Appearange: This selection poured well. Full lasting head and plentiful lacings were a welcome sight. The hue is a medium honey that is crystal clear. Good job.  Smell: The aroma is light but full of hop happiness. There were few other elements present. The hops have both an alpha and an aromatic component...American hops were evident. Another good job.  Taste: IPS...it's in the name and it certainly has that character. Interestingly, the hops didn't press too hard into the flavor sustain. This permitted a malt presence. Overall this brew has an inverted flavor curve that is very interesting in both charact and flavor. I like this brew!  Mouthfeel: As mentioned earlier, the flavor curve is inverted from a traditional selection. This is an interesting characteristic of this selection. The distinct lack of palate crouding aftertast is also a pleasant suprise. This is a UNIQUE brew.  Drinkability: Well, while there is no lingering aftertaste, the general IPA character would preclude this from a high drinkability, but for the style I find this a favorable selection. Great job Dogfish Head!  Prosit, Nikki",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,farrago,4.14,"Golden yellow color of excellent clarity, the clean white head comprised of tiny, swiftly dissolving bubbles. The nose has scrubbing, cleansing feel to it, coal tar, orange peel, sourdough bread, yeast, forest floor growth, the hops act more as a skeletal structure, leaving open spaces between the beams, for all the power it has at first sniff, graceful as it drifts off. In the mouth it's medium-bodied and much hoppier, however, with each additional sip you think it might actually pass for a pilsner. It's crisp, fresh and invigorating to drink, dries the mouth out in the way that makes you drink more. Tea leaf, tar, earth and grass, dried apples, oats, the carbonation quickens the pace and nowhere near overbearing. Nothing really sweet going on yet not bitter as a result, well-balanced. Goes down quickly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,confer,3.95,"I am becoming an IPA fan. From the bottle this beer poured a beautiful dark gold with a 2 finger off white head. Very clear with a small amount of carbonation. The head disappears pretty quickly with a lot of lacing  A very faint hoppy aroma, really smells good.  The feel is a little more watery than other IPAs but not bad.

A beautiful orange-gold color, absolutely beautiful beer. Not a lot of hop aroma, the aroma was slightly underwhelming. The flavor was much crisper and sharper than the aroma would indicate. Nice, round hop presence without being a tastebud killer. Average body for an IPA, not a lot of fullness, but also not watery. Very drinkable if you are inclined to session an IPA, this would be an excellent choice as this will not burn your tongue, and the lower alcohol will keep you vertical. A very good, reliable brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,donteatpoop,4.2,"Nice clear amber color with bit of white head, Smells really bitter/hoppy. Definately picking up some farm house vibes from it.  super hoppy, a bit of yeast sweetened? Mostly a dry and funky hoppy taste.  Goes down really smooth. The high alcohol content means I can't just pound these down, but certainly a great beer that I wouldn't mind having again.  Tasted again months later:  Clear golden color with a cap of white head resting atop the drink; decent retention.  Smells of citrusy hops, earth, grain, and surprisingly coffee beans.  The taste is a well balanced blent of citrusy hops, and grainy malt; the coffee bean taste is present as well, though quite vague and only as a lingering underlying aftertaste.... Don't know what it's doing in the IPA, but it's good.  Well balanced palate impact, good level of carbonation; no unpleasant after taste and only minimal dryness.  Best IPA in the business? Just might be.  (I don't knwo what the coffee flavor was about, I thought it might have been that my wife used my pint glass for coffee and just rinsed it clean or something; but the coffee notes were coming from the bottle as well. My previous review did not indicate coffee flavors... confusing.)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,dakid618,4.03,Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a light amber with a finger and a half of frothy head. Smell is in your face hops. Very citrusy and piney smell. Taste is also very citrusy and piney with biscuitlike malts immediately backing it up. Also hints of peanut which I've never encountered before in an IPA. Good drinkability and a good example of an IPA.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TheDoorman,4,"Pours a translucent amber complexion, with a nice white head and moderate lacing. Earthy, biscuty hop aroma; aged cheese and nuttyness. Floral and citrus flavors are not prominent. Taste mirrors the aroma. Very different than the west coast IPAs I am more familiar with. Wet and satisfying mouthfeel. Lacks the strong lingering finish of other IPAs. Dry, but not nearly as dry as other IPAs. Much cripser than others.  I find this to be an interesting IPA both beause of the unique hop flavors and the lack of a lingering hop finish. A very good, very drinkable beer, but very different that the West Coast IPAs that really tend to define the style.  Maybe its the different hop character, maybe its the low 6.0 ABV, but it feel that this beer is holding something back.

10099,6108,czfreeman,4.15,"Dogfish's 60 minutes of continual hop love pours out a amber-lager toned hue,nice light fluffy head that settles down relatively quickly, leaves lots of residual lacing. Carbonation is fairly active in delicate streams Aromas of subtle grapefruit tones,floral hoppy bouguet,little apricots,oranges. This is all balanced by a toasted maltiness that make for a nicely constructed sessionable IPA. Flavor is an upfront hoppy citric bite-followed by bicuity malts, a nice touch of pilsner-like bitterish snap on the finish. Long, lingering spiced malts remain on the palate. Drinkablity is through the roof on this IPA. More subdued than it's big brother 90min IPA, leaning more on a pilsner-like lightness with a hopped spike of Dogfish goodness. Extremely well balanced IPA,a wonderfully drinkable session brew",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,johnnybgood1999,4.57,A wonderful IPA! My trip to Total Wine in Richmond VA paid off with the opportunity to sample some Pale Ales from this brewery.  A: medium to dark amber with some apparant carbonation. about an average head that settled quickly.  S: A hoppy and pleasantly sweet aroma  T: Superbly balanced and a healthy dose of hops..  M: The balance comes through.  D: Is especially high for an IPA. I had a few down before I knew it.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,br3wmeister,3.83,"A- One inch light tan almost white head, that quickly dissolves to a thin layer on the top of the beer, some lacing on the sides of the glass. Clear golden colored beer with some orange hues.  S- Starts with some citrus, great fruit, and spiciness then some pine notes. Little earthy and some malt sweetness.  T- Malty sweetness up front that drops into bitter spicy hops. The hops continue through with some citrus but not much some sweetness again in the middle then finishes with more bitter and spice that holds of for some time.  M- Smooth, crisp, has some bite to the tongue. Good carbonation.  D- Fairly drinkable for such a hoppy beer, it is balanced pretty well.  Over all I would say its a pretty good beer but am not sure how often I would want to drink it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,jcipa88,4.92,"Wow Wee! Many have attempted, and many have fell short. This brew is something special - 60min of one succulent hop being kicked around like a soccer ball. Simply delicious and nutty on the aroma. Some may pass it up and just say... ""It's ok, a little too hoppy for me"" - and that when I'm still taking a sniff and taking twice, who wants to get naughty with this brew? Nobody! Now - mind you, I've had it on tap at the Brewery in Rehobeth Beach and at the brewery in Milton, DE. Bottles are great! Draft will make you begging for more.

10099,6108,thespaceman,4.52,"Here is my 100th beer review here on BA!  Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Beautiful copper color, strong head size with nice lacing as well. The bubbles in this on seem to cling to my glass and float to the top in abundance.  Smell: A strong citrus aroma, a boquet of fruit florals beats your nostrils to death, a nice tinge of esters/alchol is apparent as well. This one smells so balanced for an IPA!  Taste: Sour, spicy, and fruity! This one leaves a nice, bitter citrus bite on the tongue in the finish. Grapefruit, grapes, and a good oily hop presence make this beer a hop lovers treat. I love how this one has more of a estery kick then most IPA's, keeps it very interesting.  Mouthfeel: Decent amount of carbonation, but what good IPA doesn't? It's overly balanced on the tongue, it stays firm in the mouth and keeps its composure and doesn't get too wet feeling.  Mouthfeel: Overall, I've found my new favorite IPA. This one has everything I expected from DFH, a bold brew that is perfect to session compared to the 90min, which comes off a little sweet and over-hopped. If you want a sure fire hop treat this is for you! EXCELLENT!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

I will buy this again for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,mj001jk,4.27,"Amber color, white lacing with a thin persistent film on surface.  Aromas are subtle and complex, like freshly cut grass with mildly fragrant citrus and pine with a distinct floral rose character. A bit of light caramel or butterscotch and malty sweetness balance the nose. It smells very fresh and inviting almost fruity but not quite.  Awesome flavors and mouthfeel, light and crisp with a golden richness and complexity that hangs around for almost a minute on your palate. It has a fair amount of hearty bittering, but not harsh in any way, very drinkable.  One of my wife's favorite IPA's she just proclaimed so I will submit that comment as well. Can't argue with that :-)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T - Good hops flavor with a lot of balancing malt flavor. Could have been a little stronger, but still very good. Would be a great beer if you are not used to IPAs and want to try one.  M - Good full feel, very crisp and clean.  D - I could defnitely have a few of these.  Good IPA, not strong like most, but very balanced. A great one to try if you have never tried this style and would like to know what its about before getting into some of the more hoppy IPAs that turn many people away when they first try them.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,brewintheLou,3.6,"Pours a deep golden with a head that goes away rather quickly and leaves very little lacing.  I smell some hops and I think I get a hint of a bourbon like smell.  Taste has a bitter hop start with a smooth finish that leaves little after taste. Like the smell I seem to be getting a bit of a watery bourbon finish. Mouthfeel is ok, but I think this one might be a little too carbonated.

10099,6108,HopDerek,4.18,"Pours a clear amber color with 2 fingers of foamy off-white head. Average retention and some spotty lacing stick. Smells of earthy hops, sweet fruits, grains, caramel, biscuits, and a touch of pine and alcohol. Taste starts out with citrus notes and a touch of ripe fruits then a bready backbone with some caramel sweetness. Finish is very earthy with a mild pine resin notable as well. Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Smooth and balanced with a pleasant bitterness that isn't too extreme but also not too weak. Easy to drink, refreshing, and enjoyable; quite sessionable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Highbrewer,4.82,"My favorite beer! I could drink this all day if it weren't 6%. Appearance is typical light amber for an IPA.  Smell is a potpourri of fresh, complex hops with a hint of malt sweetness.  Taste is all about the hops, perfectly balanced with amber malt sweetness and the amazing Ringwood yeast strain. Hop aroma is dominant, with a complex mixture created by the unique process of continuous hopping.  Drinkability is excellent. Would drink all day and not get tired of this beer. Perfection in a bottle, without the words Extreme or Imperial to be seen anywhere.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T - Loads of bright citrus hops flavor, but not a lot of harsh bitterness. A surprising malt sweetness balances out things nicely.  M - Quite smooth & not overly carbonated.  D - Very drinkable and well-balanced IPA. I think this will be in the regular rotation when warmer weather comes along.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,seedsofchaos,3.8,"Despite the hype, I wasn't overly impressed by this American IPA.  A- Golden stray in color with a very light off-white head. Bubbles throughout after pouring like champagne but little else worth mentioning.  S- Very earthy bouquet. Hints of hops but not the profound hoppy hit that I'd expect from a 60 min IPA. Woodsy.  T- Smooth with little to no alcohol bite. Not as hoppy as I'd hoped but more bready and malty with a fairly easy does it hops flavor. Barely any real hoppy bitterness but very easy to drink.  MF- Carbonation was a bit strong with this bottle but otherwise excellent. Light and crisp. Easy on the palette. Feels good going in and going down.  D- A session beer by my definition. 6% ABV. So light and smooth that I could easily pound a few down.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,hathaway78,4.3,"This is what an IPA should be all about. True blue hoppy though and through.... I loved the hops on this beer, but the enjoyment didn't stop there. A clean finish with an aftertaste that is out of this world. I always liked Dogfish, but this beer really confirmed my decision. I am not huge on IPA, but this beer really changed my feelings.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,redjameskidd,4.1,"I was pretty surprised by this beer, I have to say. I'd heard so much for so long about these DFH IPAs. I was expecting something with a ton of hop-flavor, but that's not really what this is about at all.  Instead, it's a great easy-drinking IPA. Would be a great session beer. Smooth bitterness and mild hoppy flavor. Maybe if I had drunk this a while ago I would have said it tasted hoppier, but after recently drinking Green Flash's Hop Head Red, very little seems extremely hoppy to me. I will try to 90-minute sometime soon, but I hear that one is even more malt-focused than this one.  Still, a good beer. Doubt I'd pay 12.99 for a six-pack or whatever they charge at my liquor store, though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,hoplover82,3.38,This IPA is kinda week for an american IPA.  Pours an amber color with an off white head that quickly dissapates and leaves a little lace.

Amazingly smooth taste with notes of fruit and vanilla amongst the fresh hop background and mildly dry finish. A great session beer for an afternoon any time of year. It is light on the stomach as well as versatile in its ability to accompany many various foods. Recommended as one of the best session beers around without sacrificing taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,6stringfunk,3.65,A - One fingerhead. Amber color super clear. Lacing that disappears with time.  S - Hops on the nose. Citrousy notes.  T - Taste is hops with citrous and resin/pine. reminds me of tasting the rind or zest of an orange or grapefruit. Finish is sweeter than expected but the hops-bitterness-grapefruit lingers on and on in a good way.  M - Mouthfeel is good with good carbonation and body.  D - I bought this beer to get a good taste of what hops taste like since I'm new to beer and have been hitting the porter and stouts pretty heavy. This beer delivers on the hops and bitterness while not being overpowerful. I could drink a few of these. I look forward to more of dogheads offerings and stretching my hop palate.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

S: Great hop smell, citrus undertones.  T: Intense hops are well balanced with malt that comes through. Orange flavors come through, finished finally by the hops which remain well after consumption.  M: Carbonation fuels the great hoppy taste.  D: Very drinkable beer. The bitterness from the hops is not overpowering, and I wouldn't tire of this beer until knocking back a few.  This was my first DFH beer. My only dissapointment of this beer was the head. Poured in a snifter, perhaps my pour was not aggressive enough. Overall, a fantastic IPA. I'd like to do a side by side tasting of this with the 90 minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,LilBeerDoctor,2.36,"Reviewed on 7/26/08. On tap at the Peculier Pub. Pours a clear gold/orange with a thick white head that left nice lacing. Aroma of dull citrus, pine, grassy hops. Flavor is an odd pine bitterness, pepper. Very watery palate. I don't know if this was a bad tap line...but this was gross and not enjoyable.  Update 8/3/2008: Had this in a bottle, bottled 7/10/08 so I know it's fresh. Ugh, the same super bitter, nasty hops with no malt backbone. Near undrinkable for me. Wow, what an overrated beer. 6/4/5/2/10 (2.7/5)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,teamhex,4.17,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass  Slight head, nice lacing. Copper'isk in color. At first I thought I smelled a coffee type smell, after getting a better whiff I noticed it was really sweet smelling and it turned into a citrus fruit smell almost like flowers. As far as the taste, it starts as a smooth hop taste followed by a almost heavy grapefruit like citrus. Real heavy and thick feel in the mouth, not bad though. Iv never been a fan of IPA's but this one wasn't to bad. To me this isn't a beer I could drink at anytime, but never the less this wasn't a bad beer at all.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BeanBone,4.32,"Appearance: Crystal-clear amber body with a two-finger tall bubbly, white head that slowly fades into a quarter-inch blanket that leaves above average lacing.  Aroma: The second I cracked the bottle open, my porch filled with the smell of hops. On closer inspection, the hops are citrusy (specifically grapefruit and orange peel), piney and ride on top of a caramel backbone. There's also a strange smell, reminiscent of Orange Lucozade in there somewhere.  Taste: Hops are surely the showcase here, and they're bitter, citrusy, and piney. The sweet, biscuity malt character is very much in line with what the hops dish out, allowing for a near-perfect balance. It tastes like there's more alcohol than there really is for some reason. The aftertastes is biased towards the malt and booze, but the bitterness is still there.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and a little creamy with moderately-high carbonation.  Drinkability: With the brewery describing this as ""the session beer for beer geeks like us,"" it better go down the hatch easily. Even with the moderately-high 6% ABV, 60 Minute IPA is certainly the most sessionable offering from DFH head I've tried yet (of course, most of their beers are well over six percent...). The hops are intense, but not to any level that keeps you from ordering another.  Verdict: When compared to the rest of the Dogfish Head stable, 60 Minute is certainly one of the least extreme offerings. But that's the point, DFH mean for 60 Minute IPA to be a balanced, very drinkable, yet still exciting and unique everyday beer. A terrific example of the American India Pale Ale style, and of beer in general. After this, I'm dying to try the four-pack of 90 Minute and single bottle of 120 Minute in my cellar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,StarlightSeraph,3.97,"Poured into a pint mug.  Appearance: Pale, golden-amber color. Virtually no head, and what little there was dissipated quickly. Left a tiny bit amount of lacing  Smell: Mmm...hops. Hints of oak, and a strong citrus smell, which grew stronger as the beer warmed (grapefruit was the most prevalent). There was a very strong hop aroma when I sniffed the bottle, but once I poured it into a glass, the grapefruit dominated.  Taste: Definitely more mild hops than I was expecting for an IPA. Got a decent hop kick at the beginning of the sip, followed by a rush of grapefruit, and a lingering hoppy/citrus aftertaste. The citrus provided a nice balance to the hops, but I felt the hops were a little too muted for an IPA.  Mouthfeel: Thick and highly carbonated. Excellent body for a 'lighter' beer. I was surprised for such a heavy mouthfeel, but it was a good thing.  Drinkability: I really enjoyed this beer. If I was in the mood for an IPA, I don't think it's the first thing I would grab, but it's definitely one I would buy again. Easy to drink, even for people who aren't pure hopheads. Left a nice warming sensation as it went down.  NOTE: This beer had been in my garage for awhile (this one was bottled on June 10 of this year), so it's possible that the age had mellowed out the hops. If and when I try a newer bottle, I might update this review. I'm guessing age did have an effect...but this was thoroughly enjoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Citrus aftertaste is refreshing and lingers.  M. Full and warm. Wraps the tounge and clings to the cheeks. Perfect carbonation.  D. Very smooth and easy to drink. Likely to become a regular.

Great retention and great lacing, also.  Naturally, hops are upfront, here. They are not totally overpowering, though. (Granted, this bottle is 6 months old, so they could have already mellowed a bit.) Nice floral hop notes, with a citrus and pine background. Slight hint of some malt presence. Butterey yeastiness, in the background. Minor caramel notes.  Big hops here also, naturally. Very herbal and grassy. Bit of citrus flavor, too, mostly lemon with a hint of orange. Biscuity yeast taste mixes with a hint of malt sweetness. Touch of spiciness on the finish. Not nearly as 'big' as I expect from an american IPA.  Mouthfeel is light, crisp and clean.

10099,6108,MasterSki,3.73,"I saw that the LCBO (liquor store in Ontario) is now carried Dogfish 60, so I decided to pick up a sixer for a family gathering. No date, and it's clearly made for Canada, with French translations and such.  A - Big creamy head that dissipates slowly with nice lace. Transparent golden color with lots of carbonation.  S - Mix of biscuity malt and floral hops - not very bitter at all, but instead fairly balanced. There's also some spice and honey to it that is reminiscent of Midas Touch - does not remind me of the 90 minute at all.  T - Very English IPA feel to this, kind of like Meantime but not as good. There's only a slight citrus taste, mostly orange peel. It starts pretty sweet and then the spice kicks in - the hop bitterness only shows up in the aftertaste. I'm not sure what hops are used in this brew, but they definitely aren't my favorite. It's not bad, just not really what I want in an IPA.  M - Sweet, creamy, carbonation tickles the palate. It's probably the best thing about this brew...  D - Very easy to drink, doesn't taste like 6% at all. I just don't care for the flavor all that much. The carbonation might also slow me down after a few - gets a little bloaty.

Apricot and fresh pine and cedar team up with honeyish malt to make the aroma of this beer very pleasant. Medium body is slightly prickly on the tongue because of the carbonation and the firm bitterness. The flavor is sugar-coated citrusy fruit with a bit of crushed-aspirin and honey and bready in the finish. Leaves the mouth dry and looking forward to another sip.  This one is tasty and easy drinking, so it is a good choice when you are going to have more than one. An all-around solid beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T: Some yeasty, sourdough bread flavor up front - mild but enjoyable. Then a rush of hop oil flavors: lemon and flowers, mostly. Peppery and almost nutty esters, with a touch of alcohol. A bit of bitterness, but mostly just loads of flavorful hops.  M: Smooth, medium bodied. Creamy, rather subdued carbonation. A nice oily hop presence without being extremely dry.  D: This is very tasty and, honestly, a bit refreshing. It's still a boldly hopped American IPA, but it isn't as aggressively bitter as some of its counterparts.

T- Started off slightly malty then finished mildly bitter with flavours of grapefruit and pine. Mild alcohol bite that wasn't over pronounced. Not as strong as most I.P.A.'s I have drank, but very balanced between hops and malt.  M- Medium mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. It felt nice and lively on the tounge.  D- It is a very drinkable beer. It is slightly bitter without overpowering the taste buds and not to filling. It pairs well with spicey foods or just on it's own. It's a good intro to those new to I.P.A.'s or those looking for a every day beer with some flavor. Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,roadhouse,3.85,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appears a rather flat looking orange-gold color with a half inch off-white head that sinks to a thin skim quite quickly.  Aroma has some caramel malts, nuttiness, and quite a bit of pine with some spiciness and a very light citrus tone.  The taste is hoppy right from the start with a heavy nuttiness and light caramel malt flavor. The hops are pretty intense with lots of pine and spiciness. For once an IPA without much citrus character.  Mouthfeel is medium, very crisp, almost harsh, but still pretty drinkable.  This is certainly a very different IPA than everything else out there. It works well but the harsh carbonation hurts it a bit. Wouldn't be my first three choices for IPAs but if you haven't had it yet I would recommend trying it at least once.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Good depth of flavour. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation is medium soft. Im happy its not too carbonated.

Smell was a touch fruity, slightly woody as well.  Taste starts a bit malty, very light bit of citrus in there. Finishes hoppy, but not overly so. I am not a big fan of IPAs, but this one is pretty good, the hops don't overwhelm like they do in some I've tried. Definitely a cut above other IPAs I've tried.  Mouthfeel was decent, not weak, but not as thick as some. A bit of a lingering hoppy aftertaste.  Was drinkable for an IPA, but being as this is my least favorite style of beer, that would limit what I would drink.

I picked up a whiff somewhere along the lines of pineapple, peach, and pear. There is also a light yeast aroma in there.  Flavor: Fairly sweet and bitter, but not overly so. Well balanced IPA.  Mouthfeel: Average body for an IPA. A non-dominant finish, lasting a while but not overwhelming.  Drinkability: Fairly high, great with a light and fatty meal such as wings or fried fish.

10099,6108,TLove,4.14,"The beer poured a moderately lacquer-colored, yellowish-orange color and possesses the immediate appearance of a medium IPA. However, to smell, taste, and allow this beer to quantify in your mouth is to encounter a completely different animal. This 60 minute IPA has the capacity to deconstruct in your mouth and unleash bold flavors that are uncommon to one's typical IPA. It is at once obtrusively hop-centric and at the same time uninterested in the lack of drinkability common in overly-hoppy beers. This beer is extraordinarily well-balanced and although not as worthy as the 90 minute, is superbly more drinkable.  Enjoy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell - Not overwhelmingly hoppy and not as hoppy as I have come to expect from an IPA. More piney than citrusy.  Taste - Pretty drinkable, though the hops are more apparent here than in the nose. Refreshingly piney hop flavor. Feels like it almost gains bitterness in the finish. Stays on the palate for a while. The alcohol is pretty apparent and it's only 6% abv.  Overall - Not bad.

The head sticks around for a while before receding into a patchy layer of bubbles on top and a medium-sized ring around the glass. Lacing is decent.  Smells of light grapefruit aromas and sweet malt. Nothing's too strong, but it's still inviting.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Mild grapefruit joined by sweet malt up front, with a good amount of bitterness at the end.  Mouthfeel is good. Good thickness and carbonation, very smooth.  Drinkability is very good. A very sessionable beer - the ABV is relatively low and the flavors are mild but well-balanced.

S - clean, crackery malt, touch of caramel, light citrus hop aroma  T - good dose of juicy hop flavour to start and continues til the end, but never harsh or agressive, very smooth and clean. Malt profile has some light sweetness, and more of that crackery biscuit that shows up nicely in the finish. Hops are mostly citrus although I get a bit of pine in the middle. Bitterness is also quite smooth and not overly done. Good mix of malt, bitterness and drying alcohol in the finish.  M - med body, med light carbonation, finish is relatively dry and snappy.  D - exceptionally clean and smooth, hops are present, but do not overpower tasty malt backbone.  Extreme? No. Tasty? Hell yes, and downright sessionable in my opinion.

It is a very floral and spicy beer. It is not simply overloaded with hops, but it does have quite a bit of hop presence to say the least. The hops hit hard and then balance to near perfection with pale malts and a bit of bread as it dries out toward the finish. It starts crisp, and I would like it to stay that way, but the carbonation dies as soon as it hits your tongue.

10099,6108,dancinwillie,3.41,"pours a light amber, with a dense, small white head, that drops slowly to a covering.  a little oily citrus hop aroma, as well as light pine. A pronounced bready malt smell also. Very faint overall on the aroma.  Hoppy, citrus and piney. But also some grassy, floral, and herbal flavors. Reminds me of a English style IPA. Restrained and dignified, but hoppy as hell anyway. Malt is present, but somewhat in the shadows. Still, very balanced really, if not leaning a bit in the hops direction, but after all, this is an IPA. So balanced for the style, I guess.  Mouthfeel is good. right between thick and thin, a little creamy, a little chewy, dry finish, and just the right amount of carbonation.  Overall, a simple treat. This is not the ""wow"" beer that will blow you away. Look to the 90, 120, or something else if that's what you're after. But, if you're feeling like I was tonight, get a beer full of flavor, with minimal ABV that you can drink steady.

Hop aroma is noticeable, as it should be. Aroma is of the cirtic and floral variety. Sweet malty smell hanging out in the back.  While the beer i am drink is not quite as fresh as maybe it ""should"" be the hop bitterness is still noticeable. Citrus bitterness and hops come of ever so oily.

Hopped very nicely, but not at the expense of everything. Sweet, oily, bitter all in a very nice balance. Hop sticks to the palate, but in a tea-like bitterness after a minute or two.

Smell is reaching out from the glass on my desk. The aroma is hops upfront, piney and earthy they are inviting me to drink now and ask questions later. Caramel notes ride the back of the hops.  Flavor is strong malty backbone. The malt is biscuit and bread with dark caramel dripping off the sides. There is a nice cream flavor that accompanies the caramel malt. Hops are very well represented, but not overpowering as the grain bill in this beer keeps up with the hops. Hops are piney and citrus at the same time, there is a nice bitterness here that is quite nice.  I really like where this beer is going. I have had the 120 minute and it was even better, but I have not formally reviewed it. This beer has a nice strong hop hit, but the hops are not the only flavor in the beer.

Half way thru the head is completely gone, no lacing at all, it looks like it's been sitting overnight, and went stale. After living off other IPA's , definitely a dissappointing brew.

Poured a shade or two lighter than bronze, clear with orange hilights after it settled into the glass, short lived off-white head. A ring remained and a bit of lacing, carbonation was fleeting. Swirling the ale brings back a thin, active surface film as well as bringing out a sharp citrus smell, almost lemon lime, big hoppy aroma. The hops are very apparent again in the mouth with a lively sharpness and mouthfeel and a dry, bitter finish. While I really like the hop presence, there's a dryness that takes away from the overall effect, not as well rounded as another recent import into these parts.

10099,6108,Ralphus,4.44,"Dogfish's IPA is one that I'd been following a heated discussion on in a local forum. The provincial shipment was set to arrive in July but was late. By the end of July the forum was wondering where it was. By August there was debate about why it was late and experts had rounded in. The speculation, waiting and even bouts of anger lasted until the shipments came in late September and October. My sample was sold out across the city and required an hour round-trip drive into the country to acquire. But all of it was validated.. for within lies a beer worth caring about.  From the unassuming bottles pours a fairly unassuming looking beer. It settles to ring of foam and you might think.. what's all the fuss about? The smell gives you a hint.. pine, hops with a smooth caramel fruitiness. But it isn't until you've tasted it and gone through half your glass that the truth of it kicks in. Then you realize (or in my case blurt out), ""This is a F'n good beer!"". The rest of your drink is pure enjoyment and it all goes very fast. Smooth caramel malted vanilla like sweetness balanced perfectly with a dry pine and floral hoppy finish. If I didn't know better I'd swear there was MSG in here as well.  This is a reference beer. One which others of the style will be judged against whether they want to or not.

10099,6108,RickSawyer,4.22,"Pours a pretty clear, vibrant oaky, amber with bright, clear highlights. Head puffs up to a creamy crown before surrendering to a small layer of foam. Smell is wonderful. Spicy, piney hops layered over mint, lemon zest, white pepper, fresh rosemerry, all barely balanced by a bready malt character. Taste is hops. Again, spicy, piney, peppery, layers of citrus, floral hops. Trying to pull in the hop reigns, some bready, crystal malt ties things together. Somewhat one deminsional in the hop / malt balance, but some wonderful hop flavors layers on each other. Mouthfeel is crisp and finishes dry. Wonderful IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Greggy,4.28,"A- Pours a white 2 finger head. The head as it recedes leaves some nice sticky lacing. Head retention is good. The body is almost orange with no sediment.  S- Nice hopiness and I also get a german chocolate, and slight coffee. A little odd given it's an IPA, but it's still good. Pine is mostly grapefruit notes.  T- Bit thick feel off the bat with notes of grapefruit and peach, that give way to a dry finish with nice dry grapefruit/pine notes.  M- Very big bold thick mouthfeel on this one. Definitely impressive given the ABV. Carbonation is well played.  D- This is a great beer with a great mouthfeel. It's not available in MN, but we know where to get it in WI and will continue to do so.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,djeucalyptus,3.97,"a. Poured a clear deep straw color, without the typical amber or oranginess I was expecting. There's a bit of pink and rich gold color mixed in. A short eggshell head faded quickly, leaving a beautiful web-like residual lacing.  s. Light hops of the lemon and citrus variety, lacking the strong piney undertones or subtle floral overtones. I smell some yeastiness from the malt, more bread or cracker-like. Smells almost recall some cask-conditioned IPAs with the mild yeasty undertones.  t. clean and crisp light hops, with fairly present light malt backbone holding it all together. Citrus hops prevail, especially at the front, with very subtle floral notes emerging at the mid and finishing with some light piny and green hop oils at the tail. Pleasantly sweet and citrusy on the whole - not overly hoppy with some nice bready malt coming through balancing the whole.  m. light and crisp. Very fine carbonation suits the flavors very well. Lighter and more crisp than I was anticipating, its definitely refreshing and goes down cleanly.  d. Not bad! Very refreshing, light and crisp for a medium body IPA. Definitely not overly bitter hopping, there's an interesting balance of light citrus hop and light malts. Easy drinking, it's a good beer. The balance almost reminds of a strong pale, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I can easily drink a few at a time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BamaBeerBuff,4.07,"A: On the lighter side of the IPA color scale, this one pours a deep gold color without as much orange/ruby coloration as other IPAs. A pure white, two-finger fluffy head falls quickly to a disc of froth, leaving some decent lacing patterns on the way down.  S: The smell is most interesting. Herbal and piney hop aromas are present, but with an interesting sweet toasted malt note mixed in. The hops aren't as vibrant as some American IPAs tend to be, but the smell is still pleasant and intriguing.  T&M: The flavor is most peculiar, as well. It's got a bread-like, sweet malt backbone that is bolstered by piney hop flavor and some light fruitiness from the yeast on the finish. For all the ranting and raving about its ""continuous hopping"" on the bottle, this is a relatively balanced IPA--maybe more like an English than American. It's got a full body with a thick, syrupy mouthfeel and tingling ""small bubble"" carbonation that does the trick.  D: The balance of flavor makes 60 Minute a readily drinkable IPA. I could definitely go with this as a session beer because it drinks more like a bigger pale ale than American hop-bomb IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,GodOfBeer,4.12,"A nice deep gold colour with a decent sized head that quickly thin.  Nutty, caramely, very strong grapefruit and citrus hoppy aroma.  A complex malty taste upfront with some citrus and finishes nice and hoppy, a very tasty brew.  An average mouthfeel and a very delecteble beer leaving me wanting more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,jwinship83,3.88,"A- gloden body with a small white head  S- caramel malts with a hint of citrus or pine hops  T- alot more hoppy than it smells. nicely balanced blend of caramel/toffee malts with a piney hop finish  M- medium bodied, creamy, and smooth  D- a nice beer to introduce non craft beer drinkers to. very easy to have a couple of, and readily available.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ABHatter,4.35,"This is hands down one of my favorite beers! Poured from a 12oz bottle, Bottled on 09-02-08. just 3 weeks old. Aggresive pour into DFH tumbler produces a nice fluffy 1 inch head which disappears quickly but leaves behind some quality lacing on the glass. Tarnished brass /orangish color with a very pleasant nose. Grapefruit, pine & a touch ofcaramel/bready sweetness. Taste is sensational, Great balance of citrus fruits with an aggresive hoppiness which cleanses the palate dry and leaves a nice mouthwatering hoppy bitterness which has you craving for the next sip. Drinkable is sensational for an IPA, I could easily drink a few of these in a row. All around a top notch beer from DFH. Highly recommended!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,StrangeBrewer76,4.8,"I consider this the gold standard to which all other IPAs should be measured.  Good amber color, fresh grassy smell.  The taste is a reasonable malt launch ramp into a bouquet of hop flavors. The continuous hopping technique is evident here in the seamless hop profile.  The mouthfeel is what you would expect from an affordable beer. 60/40 liquid to bubbles.  Drinkability is ideal. Get a case or two and consider this the staple of a well stocked fridge.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Brillig,4.2,"In bottle poured in pilsner glass.  Color and head are fine.  The hop flavor goes flying past pine right to the edge of almost sour. But it manages to stay in bounds enough to be a very good, but not outstanding IPA. Could use a tad more malt backbone in my opinon.  Still one of the better IPA's east of the Mississippi.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,drinkininthewood,4.11,"Served from a 355 ml brown bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 08 04 2008  A- Nice amber bronze with decent but short lived head that laces. Good retention, lots of big bubbles.  S- Lots citrus/pine aromas, with some sight caramel.  T- Caramel up front, mid palate is grapefruit and woody/pine yet slightly herbal hop flavors with the finish faking fruity before some-more great hop oils really kick in. Great tasting IPA.  M- Carbonation is second to none for the style, and the body is medium and very smooth on the tongue.  D- Great drinker  Overall and outstanding IPA. Look forward to seeing what else this ""new-Age"" brewery has to offer. If its anything like the 60 minute im pretty sure ill be hooked!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ckaufman,4.33,"12 oz. bottle into my DFH shaped pint glass...  A: Clear golden amber with a billowy white head that falls apart fairly quickly leaving behind some mad sticky lacing with great retention.  S: Lots of hops... first some pine, then follwed by a nice citrus/grapefruit aroma. I also notice a sweet undertone in the nose.  T: Obviously a lot of hop taste in this beer, but with a nice sweet malt backbone to hold it all together. The pine and grapefruit flavor hang a long time through the finish and beyond... very nice!  M: Medium carbonation with a sticky viscous medium body.  D: This is one of those beers you can sit down and drink all night long. It never gets boring even throughout a lengthy session. One of DFHs most approachable beers, and also one of the better IPAs on the market today. Love it!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ommegoose,4.12,"12 ounce bottle dated 6/4/08. After numerous bottles, finally getting around to a review.  Color of dried apricots. Hazed gold when held to the light. Head formation was slow, but leaves a steady cap. Odd streaky lacing. Maybe has to do with the glass.  Burst of citrus aroma. There will be Cascades. Leafy hops. Some pale malt. Flowery. Gives me something different each time.  I've had a fresher bottle, but I don't mind how this tastes at this age. Sharp bitterness has faded, and fruity flavors really come through. Juicy grapefruit and tangerine. Piney and minty herbal character is present in the back end and finish. I appreciate that it doesn't overdo it on the pine. Some mild caramel malt, a little nutty.  I found the body sufficiently hefty. Carbonation is a little on the low side, which I like.  After drinking an Unearthly last night, this seems more subdued than I remember. But if I pull some of these out in the upcoming malty beer season, I'll get my hop fix. Not a hard beer to drink a few of. Will buy again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,bobsy,4.52,"Light amber pour with a generous white head of microbubbles. The head fades a little, but laces well. The aroma is excedingly fresh and leafy, like running through a forest and into a stand of pine trees. The flavour also burst with a leafy freshness, edged by notes of pine and grapefruit, and set against a caramel malt body. Medium-light mouthfeel makes this eminently drinkable, and a very solid IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,trbergman,4.3,"Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into a shaker pint. Bottled 6/18/08.  Appearance - Pours a light amber-copper color with a half-inch bone white head that quickly recedes to a thin lace.  Smell - Citrusy hops, grapefruit, hints of caramel.  Taste - Plenty of hop bitterness up front, with grapefruit, pine, peppercorns. In the middle I taste hints of caramel and toffee, but the focus here is definitely on the hops. Finishes dry with long-lived bitter aftertaste. Fantastic!  Mouthfeel - Clean, not too heavy, but with a firm body appropriate to style.  Drinkability - I've sessioned this beer on numerous occasions and while it can get a little boozy, it's still a pleasure on the second or third pint. It's neither boring nor overwhelming -- perfect when you want more than one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Antilochus,4,"First day of release at the LCBO! Picked up 3 sixers of this at the North London (ON) location. Poured into a wine tumbler. 355mL, 6.00% abv.  Clear amber orange body with a respectable white head. Tons of lace all over this. Nice.  Medicinal sharp hop notes, pine, lots of wood notes here, hmm, caramel malt sweetness.  Palate is remarkably sweet, neutral feel on the carbonated side, some woody notes again. Finishes on sharp yet tasty bitterness, more pine, moderate citrus.  nom nom nom",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,CanuckRover,3.51,"Pours a nice light amber. Big nice head with fair retention. Webby lacings.  Aroma is on style for an American IPA. Lots of citrus and a promising grain smell that hints at some nice malt.  This beer slaps you in the face. It's not that it's overly bitter, it isn't, but the hop flavours seem out of whack. It starts with a sharp hit of sappy pine, and, true to the label, continues on like that. I have no doubt that there's some fine malt in there, but I have trouble getting at it.  I have a problem with the whole ""continually hoppy"" thing. I feel like a beer should develop and be layered. I like nice hops that give way to nice malt or vice-versa. In this case, the hops dominate all the way through.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,webmanspidey,4.1,"Very good IPA. It is not as overwhelming as some, a more balanced refreshing taste than the more ""hop you to death"" philosophies other IPAs can espouse.

D: Decent, not the best IPA I've had, but one of the better ones I've tried. Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of IPA's but this one is pleasant enough. I'd drink it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Gehrig,4,"Clear golden-orange body with a dense finger of off-white head; nice duration and lace rings adorning the Yankees pint glass. Fine hop aroma, somewhat floral but more bitter with a citrus tinge--orange and grapefruit especially. Bitter hop taste with lots of citrus and pine. Good taste but its bitterness is not unlike Dogfish Head's 90-Minute version. I'd prefer more and better balance, a bit more citrus flavor. The bitterness somewhat adversely affects the mouthfeel as well, which is otherwise good, solid, and creamy.  A good IPA, not great, surpassed by plenty of others. Nonetheless, this is good and worth trying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,mullenite,4.3,"Poured a clear golden color with a two finger white head that left fast but left excellent lacing behind.  Smelled strongly of citrus, reminded me more of a hefeweizen then an IPA on the nose. You can smell the hops as well but the initial wiff is straight citrus.  Taste is amazing and my new favorite for the style. Great hop flavor from start to finish without being overly bitter.  Carbonation is perfect, body is fairly light (low end of the medium scale) and leaves a great taste in your mouth. With the relatively low alcohol content this beer is very easy to drink and for those with higher tolerances could even be considered sessionable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Strong hop and pine aroma, with some citrus as well (grapefruit?). Smells like a good IPA should smell. The taste is much of the same...hoppy and fruity, but well balanced. Some bitterness finishes off the taste. Mouthfeel is light bodied and a little sticky. Goes down very well. One of my favorite IPA's and each time I drink it I am reminded why. It'll go well with the NFL game tonight.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Every beer seems the same and the excitement of trying a new beer is gone....then something as brilliant as 60 minute IPA comes along and reminds you that beer can be exciting and new. This was my first Dogfish Head brew, and I will have to try the other IPAs, as I've heard they are better. The dour mood I was in before this beer dissipated quickly, leaving just a smile on my face and joy in my heart.

10099,6108,whiplash3825,3.8,"A hard pour yields a clear orange-amber color with a nice two-finger head. Pretty good lacing as it's consumed.  Hops are center-stage in the nose, and alcohol is detectable also.  Taste is rather one-dimensional IMO... all hops with very little malt to back it up and balance it. I'm not against ""hoppy"" beers, but the one flavor that is prominent in this one is bitterness. Sweetwater IPA, which is equally hoppy (and my favorite IPA to date) seems to come across more as a ""grapefruit"" sourness, which I prefer over a bitter taste and aftertast.  Mouthfeel is good; seems more creamy and carbonated than your average IPA, and I like that even if it isn't quite typical to the style.  The drinkability is good in spite of the bitterness and noticable alcohol... you get pretty much over those after the first one or two.  To sum up, I expected more given the reviews. I urge everyone who can get it to try the Sweetwater IPA... it's a better-balanced IPA IMO, and I sure like being able to support my local brewer and still feel I'm getting a superior product!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Not a huge hop aroma, but hops are there I suppose.  t - One of the funkier IPA's I've ever tasted. The hops don't overwhelm the palate, which is rare. I get hints of bread, peanut butter, apples, and maybe even some corn flakes. Odd, but I dig it for sure.  m - Brilliant bitterness on the tongue ... a real treat. I like to imagine Corona drinkers spitting this out.  d - Quite sessionable. Can't wait to try the 90 minute.  Final thoughts - The constant hopping approach has clearly offered a more complex bitterness sensation, but has taken away from the floral aroma of most IPAs. I'm a little late on the boat with Dogfish Head, but I am loving their offerings.

Aroma is weak, however, so it isn't very impressive.  3.5 T: Not a whole hell of a lot going on. Don't get me wrong, it has a nice taste, there just isn't enough of it. I might just be used to stronger IPAs (many doubles), but I've come to expect more. Hoppy but not overly so. Flavors are sweet corn husk, citric acid, and plenty of yeast. The bite from many an IPA is not there.  4.0 M: A bit creamy, yet freshening. Good carbonation.  4.0 D: By no means a bad beer and one that you could drink all night.

10099,6108,superdedooperboy,4.22,"Sampled on-tap at the Pizza Joint here in Evans, GA. Service from a pint glass.  Appearance was a somewhat hazy deep-gold. When I received the beer, what could have once been a relatively thin white head was gone; of course, the bartenders at this place are known for eliminating the head from the glass in order to serve more beer. What remained, though, left absolutely no lacing in the glass.  Aroma was bright and sweet, with some floral notes and perhaps some ripe berry was well.  Mouthfeel was medium-thin, with relatively low carbonation. This could, of course, also account for the lack of head retention and lacing.  Taste was big, herbal hops up front, with some grainier, malty notes hitting as the drink warms. Finish is somewhat bitter and rather dry, due in large part to the hops. The aftertaste mellows out nicely to a semi-dry bitter-sweetness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,gatorguy813,4.21,"I first sampled this beer last night. It was drank from a pint glass with roughly a 1 1/2 inch head. It had a very earthy smell, with an excellent mouthfeel. It was a medium-dark amber color. Taste, obviously very hoppy, but not overwhelming. I am will certainly purchase this brew again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,LunaChick,3.8,"This is a very good example of an American IPA. It pours a very rich amber to almost light copper colour with a minimal head. I would suspect the lack of head came in part with the ""new"" tap system and maybe the glass wasn't totally clean. `Given my experience with IPA's I'll chalk it up to the pour and the glass. The smell is very rich and earthy hops, citrus and some pine. A slight hint of yeast hits the back of the nose and the malts are present. Flavor is very smooth starting with rich hoppy pine. The hops linger on the back of the mouth. Malts balance very well. The overall finish is slightly dry but not over powering. Flavor is full bodied and transitions well. In the mouth slight oilly residue is present but overall not intense. A very well balanced beer. At 6% abv it is ideal to have 2 pints.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BDIMike,4.05,"Pours a dark, golden color. Great thick white head caused by a lot of carbonation and very good retention. Looks very inviting. Very nice smell to this IPA. It is rare because it has a wheat smell to it that is dominated by the hops. Very rich hop smell. Taste lets down from the smell, but is good. The hops taste very good and strong and are slightly balanced by the wheat. The mouthfeel is good. Good carbonation that adds a bite to the mouth. Drinkability is very good. This IPA has a ton of taste, but not a killer hop taste that wears on the tongue. I know from experience. The waitress had just dropped one of these off when I bit into the HOTTEST pepper I have ever tasted. I finished the 60 minute in front of me AND three others within 5 minutes because of the burn. I would like to give a bit of props to the waitress at Fire in Cleveland, OH for keeping them coming and saving my tongue.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Medium carbonation and clear.  S & T - Smell of oily hops and orange peel. Nice citrus notes which comes out in the taste behind the hop blast. This is a very hoppy beer with a good bite. Creamy and decently smooth.  M - Moderately carbonated with a slick oil feel. Somewhat drying at the end.  This was pretty good for the style. The hop bitterness made the drinkability low for me. It was tasty especially with the orange citrus background but it's nothing I'd really crave often. Refreshing in the end.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

I enjoyed the smell of the brew and it definitely whetted the appetite.  T & M: This is one of the best IPAs out there and in my opinion is slightly better that the 90 Minute IPA.

S- beer is overflowing with the smell that reaks of citrus, and spice. Was strong enough that it caused me to sneeze a moment later. One of my favorite part of drinking an IPA.  T- is lighter tasting than expected, and thats not a bad thing. Hop bitterness is evident, but in no way is it overwhelming. Also has a bit of sourness in the taste. very refreshing.  M- beer continues to become more bitter thlonger you keep it in your throat. woody after taste that is common with many IPA's. I like it when my IPA's stay with my taste buds the longer i keep it in my mouth.  D- though the beer has its share of flavor, its not over bearing and very easy to drink.

A lot of hops, but not overpowering. Well balanced hoppy flavor, a tad bit of bitterness but smooth and refreshing. Mouthfeel was good, light on the palate but had good texture.

It smells like resiny hops and to me coffee hints on a nice rich roast. First taste was amazing. Malty coffee, big hops but not too bitter. rich hop flavor is amazing. the only thing better than this beer, is to roll hops around in your mouth. Mouthfeel is heavy, but sooo drinkable. great effort once again dogfish head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,KeefD,4.22,"Poured a bright orange color with a nice inch worth of foam that leaves some light lacing down the glass. Delightful orange/citrus aroma mixed with a little pine-forest. Interesting! Citrus flavors abound from the hops, balanced out by a nice malt sweetness. Bitterness is not overly present, but that's a good thing. Quite different than many other IPAs I've tried. Medium bodied with good carbonation. I could definitely put a few of these back in one sitting.

Lighter than your standard IPA in color, its an aubern with yellow highlights and a nice frothy off white head that left some lace and stuck around decently. Nice mix of piney and citrus hops in the nose with a floral note as well, all backed by the smell of sweet malts. The taste is bitter pine and slightly sour citrus but both in a good way. Sweet malted backbone keeps it ballanced. Mouth feel is medium but does have some nice hop oil that helps the flavor stick on the finish.

Smell is great, with strong notes of citrusy, grassy and piney hops.  Taste is also superb, with a flavorful hop presence, that is not overly bitter. Enough malt is present to balance it perfectly.

Tasted of citrus and pine, an excellent balance of the two which made for a very refreshing beer. The hops were there but not intrusive.  Mouthfeel was great. Crisp and carbonated with a medium body. Feels nice in the mouth.  This is a beer which lends itself to easy drinkability. One of the best session beers I've ever had.

10099,6108,bluemoonswoon,4.34,"12oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams pint glass  A: Pours a crytal clear new penny copper, maybe even a bit lighter than that, one of the lighter IPAs I've seen in a while. A three quarter inch head settles nicely on top of the beer and is supported by a few thin ropes of carbonation bubbling up from the laser etchings below. Head fades to a thickish ring and leaves minimal lacing.  S: Hops are dominate as they should be, very little malt to speak of. Strong resiny hop oils give off aromas of pine, mild phenols which imparts a nice herbaly medicinal tone which is all rounded out by a rather bitter melon aspect. Smell is very fresh and very clean.  T/MF: Opens with an almost smooth melony flavor but is quickly overrun with that strong pine resin character that dominated the inital aroma. Midway through tasting and the finish a fresh grainy flavor is brought out but quickly closes with that same phenolic finish. The body on this beer (IMO) is really something to behold, its nice and robust, almost chewy, it really gives you a sense that you are drinking a beer with some character and makes it seem higher in ABV than it actually is. Really solid mouthfeel that leaves a medium amount of drying sensation on the tonuge, this beer really is a pleasure to drink.  D: After a while this beer seems to take on an earthier woody kind of character, really hop forward IPA and does not dissapoint, wish it looked just a bit prettier but really we are talking about how the beer tastes so it does not matter that much. This beer is fantastic, I don't know why I'm trying not to like it. Highly drinkable and pairs excellently with a supreme pizza.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Overlord,4.35,"Very underappreciated, IMHO. Not a palate scorching hot bomb, nor a maltier, red-ale esque IPA. Quite balanced. Pours a light clear amber orange. Nice white foam head with a long lasting rim around it. Smells florally with some pine. The smell actually reminds me a bit of Sculpin, but without that tropical hue.  The flavor is sweet caramel malt with pine, a bit of grapefruit (but more pine), and a nice sweeter citrus after-taste. Very pleasant. I could easy drink fifteen or twenty of these at a sitting (a long sitting). Nice lively mouthfeel, and very drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,everetends,4.1,"12 oz bottle thanks to BamaBeerBuff and AmishT. Poured into a shaped DFH pint.  A: Poured a fine amber color with a pillowy cream colored head. Great retention here and produced some nice slow, stickin lacing. Very nice.  S: Smell is of nice citrus and piney hops. Still with the big hop smell, you get some nice buscuity malt.  T: Taste mirrors the smell. Piney/citrus hops are very well balanced with a nice bready malt. There is some hops bite, but it is really mellowed by the malt. Very balanced brew.  M: Medium bodied brew that is creamy. Leaves some bitterness in the mouth. Creamy texture just helps balance this beer out.  D: This beer is a totally different monster than the 90. Both are great but this one has more of a hops profile where the 90 has more malt. Depends on what you are after. Still a great beer and easily drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

All of the hop and biscut/doughy flavors are present, but no sharp edges at all. Nothing overdone, just smooth. Slight sour aftertaste.  A very well crafted, well balanced IPA.

10099,6108,peabody,4.3,Pours out a clear amber orange ale with two fingers of white suds that leave lots of lacing. Smell is citrus and mango. Pineapple and Grapefruit.Bready yeast and piney hops abound here. Great smell ! Taste is not as intense as the 90 but still a wonderfull brew. Citrus hops and sugary malts that leave a dark mysterious blackness on the side of the tounge. I am thinking that this beer in the bottle is just as good as out of the keg. The keg might be just a little bit more mellow. Mouthfeel is a bit oily but still very clean and refreshing. I could drink this one all night long!

10099,6108,Reagan1984,4.32,"This is one of those beers that helped me realize that the ""fresh"" beer taste I thought was only available on draft could be found in a bottle. I give many thanks for my buddy Dan for showing me 60 Minute IPA several years ago. It's been a great trip exploring many bottled IPA's since. But more importantly, 60 Minute has been one of my IPA main stays since that day.  The beer is bright amber in color and has a thick creamy head that does stay on the scene for quite some time. Not much in the way of visible carbonation and the beer is slightly cloudy. I've always found that this beer has a nice amount of lacing.  Aroma is of pine and citrus to me with a background of biscuit like malt. I love the aroma of this beer and its one reason why you must enjoy in a glass vs. out of the bottle. (all beers, not only this one)  The taste is big, fresh, hoppy and wonderful. Pine/grapefruit notes bombard you while there is a substantial malt background to provide balance. The malt character stays for a while, then subsides and lets the hop notes linger. This is what I enjoy. A beer that you can taste, enjoy between sips while you talk or just stare into space.  Mouth feel is medium to light in body and this beer is very drinkable as far as I'm concerned.  Thanks to Dogfish Head for this one!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The smokin' aroma improves as the beer warms....biscuity malts are more apparent. Nice...very nice.   Hops dominate throughout with a balance of roasty malts, & flowery subtle citrus. More grapefruit like than the first smell revealed. There's a ghostly subtle citrus aroma that lingers in the nose after a not too dry finish.

A - This brew pours a light copper color with a 3/4"" head that disappears relatively quickly into an extremely light lacing that didn't stick to the side of the glass until it was most of the way gone.  S - I would say that I was disappointed with softness of the hop aroma is on this IPA but the fact that Dogfish makes a significantly hoppier IPA in the 90min so there's more to that story. Hops were the most prominent smell, though.  T - There is more of a balance between the malt and hops on this brew than I would expect from an IPA but, after the majority of the mouthful is on it's way down the hatch, there is a decent tinge of bitterness on the back of the palette.  M - The feel of this IPA is in the middle of the road with a medium to light carbonation tickling the tongue.  D - This is where this brew shines the brightest. For an IPA, and it is definitely that, the Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA is significantly more drinkable than any other IPA I have had.

As the beer warms, a lightly toasty malt aroma is apparent. Bitterness is not overly agressive, but sufficient to balance the malt, allowing only a slight sweetness to come through in the taste.  After taking some initial tasting notes, I finished the beer while eating some spicy papadums.

T: superior bitterness on the initial sip, the balance comes through as it goes across the tongue. a well balanced hop-malt flavor impresses even the most avid-IPA drinkers. M: medium body with a nice carbonation that helps with the bitterness. absolutely the most drinkable IPA I have ever experienced. If on;y this was available here in springfield.

A more than adequate animal cracker malt base with nice, though kinda light, grapefruit and pine sappy hops.

Smells piney and citrusy with a sweet note of honey-covered pineapple.  Taste is a piney, citrusy caramel mix balanced with a wonderful grapefruity bitterness. Sweet, but not overly so. Hoppy, but no hop bomb. Just about perfect, the drink is clean, refreshing, and crisp without any muddling in the flavors.

S- Very piney with hints of orange and grapefruit citrus notes. Subtle balancing malt is quickly covered up again by the big hop aroma.  T- Citrusy up front with a gigantic bitter finish of pine. There is a doughy malt in the middle, but the focus on this is on the hops all the way. This is, in my opinion, a bit more hoppy than the 90 minute, and less balanced, though it doesn't need to be. The hops are allowed to shine without being too overpowering.  M- Medium in body, nice and creamy with a good amount of carbonatioin.  D- An easy drinker, reasonably moderate ABV with a full flavour.

Citrus bitterness and a matching solid backbone of roasty malts.  M: Full bodied and refreshing. Different body and texture, not as oily as 90 minute but this is still creamy.  D: Easy as any beer to drink. Epitome of a fallback beer when you are looking for something mild but a kick of flavor.

Smell - A little light on the smell to me, smells of the normal citrus and hops, almost has a smoky smell in there as well.  Taste - The hops don't hit you quite as much as some other IPAs, but they are definitely still there. Again the smokiness shows up, as well as a slightly sweet malt. Citrus on the finish.  Mouthfeel - Perfect amount of carbonation in this one, and the tastes that linger are very pleasing.  Drinkability - This is one of the easiest IPAs to get into, as nothing truly overpowers. Very well-rounded for an IPA, and the maltiness does show up.  Never going to be my favorite IPA, but I wouldn't hesitate to pick up a 6-pack when I'm unsure of what to drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Wetpaperbag,4.35,"A- The pour left a small amount of head with active bubbles within the beer. This left a small white film on the top of the brew.  S- Delicious grapefruit smells truly shine through, along with other citrus notes. Sweet fruitiness is also there as well.  T- Citrus tastes are a definite yes given to the great hops flavors. The grapefruit taste is more present as a citrus flavor that is an undertone and at times an overtone of the brew. The malt is also very much there as well.  M- Good mouthfeel, not too fizzy and easy to down.  D- Great brew, easy to down like I previously mentioned.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,YankChef,4.29,"Bottled on 4/23/08  Appearance: Peach amber with a 1/4 inch white head that is pretty creamy in appearance at first and then dissipates to just a whisp, still covers the beer nicely  Smell: The aroma is very fragrant with a lot of pine and resiny goodness. Apricots certainly come to mind as well as fresh cut grass?  Taste: A perfect example of balanced imbalance, there is a lot of almost sweet citrusy flavor up front that gives way to a serious hop domination but not terribly bitter at all.  Overall: One of the refrigerator standbys, always a pleasure to see a 60 minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ralree,4.8,"A: Cloudy yellow with a really nice white fluffy 2-finger head. Laces perfectly, and the retention is brilliant.  S: Smells really good - hoppy and tangy. This is one of the best smelling IPA's I've encountered. Fruit (sort of a cherry smell) is backed by the fresh smell of hops.  T: Wonderful flavor. We have great hop flavor on the surface to start, with undertones of fruit. After swallowing, some alcohol flavor comes into play, but it certainly isn't overpowering. Hop flavor lingers.  M: Perfect carbonation, pretty non-astringent, medium-heavy bodied. It's a little syrupy, but I like that in this style. Lingers on the tongue for a bit.  D: I could definitely drink one of these with a good burger, and have another right after. Due to the richness, (and the alcohol content) I probably wouldn't want to drink too much, though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,GJ40,4.36,"Sampled in a Dogfish Head shaped pint glass.  A- A perfect golden color with good clarity and a thick, foamy head.  S - Hoppy but not super hoppy. Floral and citrusy. Some malt and yeast too.  T - Very citrusy with some bitterness and sweetness. Very clean and crisp.  M - Nice moderate carbonation level that lets the flavor shine through.  D - So easy to drink. It's very flavorful yet smooth and refreshing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Buebie,3.92,"Bottled on 3-14-08  Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a snifter. Its a golden light amber color. Head from a rigerous pour is 3 fingers deep, white and fizzy.  The aroma is sweet honey nut cheerios, meets citrus hops. There is a nutty, floral hops aroma, and a slight apricotty fruitness.  Mouthfeel and taste up front is fizzy carbonation with nutty sweetness, some floral hops through the middle. The ibu's command attention after the swallow. They gather steam and then slowly fad to nothingness with a very small hop linger. Crisp, clean and refreshing.  This beer is very much my summertime beer of choice. If only it was more readily available in Mn, as I purchased this from Chicone's in Hudson.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,PhxHorn,3.47,"On tap for $5.75 at Yardhouse, this had better be good. In fact, it had better be outstanding for that price. Unfortunately, it's not. Color is a medium yellow with zero head, smells faintly of citrus. Tastes mildly of citrus, but just not a whole lot of flavor going on. The best I can say is that a weak-ass beer like this goes down easily when it's 110­° outside, which it is today. But overall, this beer is a huge disappointment after hearing all the hype about Dogfish. One of the weakest IPAs I've ever had. What the fuck?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,swizzlenuts,4,"The colour of the beer is a light copper with a centimeter head. Decent head retention.  The nose on the beer is mostly malts, but it has a hint of hops. The taste of this beer is actually quite different. There are not floral hops, it has a lot of almost roasty malts, but then hits you at the end with the bitterness. It's almost a bridge IPA, meaning it'd be a beer you'd give to a person to ween them onto hops. I personally would want more hop character, but this is obviously going for something different than most IPAs, which isn't so bad. It just isn't my thing. When I drink an IPA, I want the hops to fucking hit me in the face. The mouthfeel is quite standard with a bit of creaminess and a bit of carbonation. The drinkablility in this beer is pretty standard (for me).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Poser,4.43,"Golden amber with a lingering, frothy top. Citrus and hoppy aroma with maybe some nutty characteristics. The taste is bold and complex. A heavy, malty texture but the hops are there from the first taste, which is to be expected from DFH. The citrus is the first thing you taste and it just stings more as it goes from first sip to finish. The aftertaste is a period of acidic recovery for your mouth. The mouth is on the heavier side of medium.  I really love this beer. It's not as bold as the 90 Min and it's not as ridiculous as the 120 Min, but I think it's more balanced and better for it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,kevinglin,4.2,"A very nice beer - pours a clear golden/yellow with a white head formed of tight bubbles. Quarter-inch of foam sticks around, leaves a nice lacing, and crisp carbonation rises to the top of the glass 'til the end.  Pronounced fragrant, citrus hop nose and the taste follows without too much bitterness. Definite hop dominance, but not an overly aggressive bite, though the aftertaste does have a bit of a bitter pucker that reminds you that you've picked up a solid IPA.  Light-medium body, nearly effervescent, finishes somewhat dry.  A good starter IPA for someone new to trying the style and stepping up their appreciation of hops - not overpowering like some of the more extreme IPA/DIPAs that are on the market now. Could drink these all night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell: A nice combination of earthy and rooty citrus hops with some grapefruit rind and some mild chocolate and maybe toffee and a bit of caramel for the malt flavors.  Taste: Balanced earthier citrus hops and later bitterness with mild sweeter malt flavors, dark bread, mild chocolate, and a semi-dry finish with a lot of nice bitterness and length.  Mouthfeel: Lighter-bodied with a good fullness and prickly carbonation bite near the end.  Drinkability: I think this a good starter for those trying to get into the style. Highly balanced and flavorful enough for the beginner and the hophead.

Smells like earthy UK hops, really well done. Seems light and sessionable until it is swallowed and the hops pour in. Its like an entirely different beer, pine comes out of nowhere. An amazing multi-dimensional beer. aftertaste is juicey and well lived. Taste becomes more biscuity/toasted/nutty as it warms.

T - resinous with some grapefruit in the background; very much like the aroma. No surprises here.  M - mouthfeel is creamy with a medium body and an almost resiny feeling at the end..

Great lacing, a sweet light citrus aroma, a very smooth hoppy taste with a great finish, slightly syrupy on the pallet, and as I mentioned very drinkable.

Three-quarter inch off-white head with copious amounts of bubbles in solution rising from the bottom of the glass. Some webs of white lacing present during the tasting. Scent of hops and citrus fruit. Taste consistent with nose with a touch of grassiness also revealed. Flavors are well-balanced and taste is consistent throughout, with hops flavoring gradually peaking towards the end. Finish starts out slightly sweet, reveals a hint of grapefruit, then leaves a mild lingering astringency at the very end. Lively mouthfeel falls somewhere between thin- and medium-bodied, but very much style appropriate. Not too much carbonation burn. Very drinkable and crisp brew.

Solid, and I love the hops, but it doesn't have the extra oomph of different flavors that the 90 had.  Mouthfeel all right, maybe a little thin.  A hop-packed experience here, to be sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Head was about 2 and a half fingers thick and off-white with pretty good retention.  Smell: Very piney with hints of orange and grapefruit citrus notes. Subtle balancing malt is quickly covered up again by the big hop aroma.  Taste: Citrusy up front with a gigantic bitter finish of pine. There is a doughy malt in the middle, but the focus on this is on the hops all the way. This is, in my opinion, more hoppy than the 90 minute, and less balanced, though it doesn't need to be. Te hops are allowed to shine without being too overpowering.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Fair head retention and sheets of sticky lacing throughout.  S: Essences of hops, pine and citrus.  T: An aggressive hit of hops announces this ale's intentions. Solid malts stand up to the initial rush of hops, before yielding to notes of pine, cedar and citrus.  M: Clean, crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Adequately carbonated.

Very clean  D - quite drinkable. The bitterness does not get in the way and the carbonation adds to a good texture. Fresh and crisp.  Overall - quite a good IPA for the beginner IPA drinker.

It has a nice golden color with orange highlights and a small white head that makes great lace on the glass. The aroma is full of piney hops with some floral and citrus notes as well. Like the aroma the flavor is strait up hops over a lightly toasted malt base. It has a medium bodied palate with a slightly oily texture. The bitterness of the hops lingers long into the finish making this a grate beer for hop lovers.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

They had it on tap at the BBC, and it had a great smell and tasted even better. I tried to get that same great taste later at home with a six pack, and while it was good, it wasn't the same as the draft version I had tried earlier.

Tastes surprisingly smooth, very balanced. The continual hop addition seems to erase that rift that commonly occurs between hops and malt... the oily hops don't end, the malt doesn't begin... the beer just exists in harmony. Very balanced. Personally, I would have like more hops, more bitterness, more hop excitement!

The first warm and sunny yet still a little cool perfect spring day called for some spring cleaning, and that includes my beer. This bottle was procured at a Yoke's in the Tri-Cities during a wine tour last fall.  Poured into an American pint glass, it appears an attractive cloudy orange-amber, with two fingers of bubbly head, which disappears fairly quickly, leaving very little lacing on the glass. The nose is predominantly bready malt, with a pine hop aroma that was quite faint, most likely due to this bottle's age. The flavour allows more of a pine/citrus hop bitterness to come into play, balancing with the malt, which takes a step back. This beer has a very nice full body, and a subtle amount of carbonation.

It has a nice bitter twang, but nothing extreme. There's a decent amount of biscuit flavor to provide a bit of malt backbone to balance the hop bitterness.  The body is light, but not watery.

The head slowly dissipates until it forms a thin layer atop the beer.  Smells malty sweet with a nice spicy/herbal hop kick coming through. Sweet but light citrus notes abound. Don't expect to kicked in the face by a mountain of hops.  The taste is quite balanced (which surprised me) it's got a fantastic sweet malt backbone that's held together by some spicy hops. It's still quite bitter (as it should be for an IPA) but it has such a great balance to it.  Light to medium body on the tongue. Nice carbonation. Finished nicely.  Quite drinkable in the long run. It can really be a session type ale, but coming in at 6% it might not be a good idea to imbibe on a few of these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Rzzzzz,4.52,"Poured into a pint glass, golden to light amber, good looking head that disipates in a few minutes but leaves some nice lacework.  Aroma of fresh pine and citrus (I'm gonna say tangerine) with malt wafting through the background, and more pine. If it were legal I'd ditch the Repo Man pine tree hanging from my rear view mirror and replace it with an open bottle of this stuff.  Initial flavor is hops, but not overpoweringly so, as the sweet malt quickly follows to create a solid balance. Spicy bitter hops finish lingers pleasantly on the palate.

Head retention is good, with moderate visible carbonation, and some decent lace.  Aroma is a prefect balance of sweet grains and spicy hops. Not overly harsh or intense by any means. Floral. Hop profile becomes more full and complex as it warms.  An excellently crafted hop flavor. Rich and flavorful, though in no way overly bitter. No overwhelming aftertaste either. Floral and Earthy, with hints of citrus. Finish is dry and packs a piney bite.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T - Nicely balanced, sweet pale malt body with a generously hoppy bite. Dry finish which carries over the pine hop flavors.  M - Light bodied, medium carbonation, sweet aftertaste which accompanies an oily pine residue that is left behind.  D - Very nicely done, a definite must try for everyone, even those who aren't fans of hoppy brews, as this IPA is very well balanced. An easy drinker and a tasty one at that.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,jbphoto88,4.1,"Poured from a too cold 12 oz brown bottle at the local pub.  It looks like someone put one drop of red food coloring into a golden blonde beer, making it have a light reddish hue. The tan head is soft and fluffy with larger bubbles. Nice lacing and a fine dissipation leaving a soft ring of foam just on the top of the liquid.  Hops, hops, hops slightly unbalanced with the malts and behind a veil of citrus. A nice piney grapefruit nose. Very appealing.  Smooth taste and good biting mouthfeel from a mix of the fine carbonation and hops. Slightly more bitter then expected but it works very well with this brew. The hops dominate the flavor but a pleasant piney, citrus (grapefruit) flavor and a light warmed, sweet malt finish the taste.  Very easy to drink and quite refreshing for an IPA. I will have to try this one right next to the 90 min and decide which one I like better.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,aerozeppl,4.1,On tap at the Lionheart.  A: Nice solid golden orang color. 1/2 finger of white head. Tons of lacing from top to bottom.  S: Not as hoopy at it is in the bottle. Very subdued really for an IPA. Really almost like a session IPA. Has all the flavor you would want without the ABV death.  M: Very crisp in the mouth. The carbonation suits the beer very well. Has only a slightly syupy tone to the beer.  D: Very nice beer. The hops are there but not dominating but enough to satisfy the hopheads while not being enough to discourage the average beer drinker.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,tpd975,4.3,"Tried this one on draft for the first time today after enjoying it regularly from the bottle.  A: Nice bright orangish hue with a tall bubbly head. The head dies rather quickly but does leave behind nice sticky lacing.  S: Just like from the bottle. Big hop aromas. Tons of c hops with notes of and wet fresh cut grass.  T: A bit more hoppy than from the bottle. You get a rush of grapefruit right up front. A bit of malt sweetness come thru in the middle for balance before being treated to a lingering citrus finish.  M: Medium bodied sort of crisp.  D: Very drinkable in the bottle even more so on draft.  Overall: This is a great session brew. I actually like the 90 minute better even to session, but that is not to slight this beer at all. It is a great drinking IPA that will match most out there in taste and drink ability. DFH makes wonderful brews and this is no exception. Most brewers would be happy to hang their hat on this one, yet DFH makes many other more exotic and limit pushing brews.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

S: A rather sprucey/pine hops aroma, a touch of citrus scents, and a little balance of malts sweetening up the mix.  T: Piney hops, but very moderate. Not a huge hop explosion, but enough to please hopheads (at least one would hope ;) ). A nice balance of malts rounding it out. Quite nicely done.  M: A nice, slippery mouthfeel. Good, a little viscous, and finally crisp. A clean finish, with a little lingering bitterness.  D: An easy drinker, reasonably moderate ABV with a full flavour. An excellent beer, and while I might tend to lean towards the 90 minute a little more, I'd take this any day.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,riboflavin88,4.5,"This is one of my new favorite beers. It poured a butterscotch color with a frothy, thick head that laces beautifully. Its nose was woodsy to me with notes of malt and citrus. Its taste had the signature bitterness of an IPA, but was balanced very well with the beer's citrus and spice notes. Mouthfeel was great, highlighting a perfect amount of carbonation and dry taste up front, finishing with bitey toasty notes. I highly recommend this beer, and will definitely buy it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

M: This beer is dry and spicy during the middle and finishes with a prickly, toasted, and peppery mouthfeel at the finish.  D: Very Very good!

10099,6108,TheIPAHunter,4.05,"Golden poppy; a powder white halo crowns this offering. One-quarter stick maculation; a stiff, retreating head and carbonation complete the cipher of liquid sustenance.  Smell is an interesting mix of pine needles, grass, roasted nuts and buttermilk biscuits.  Aggressive pine character and toasted malt. Hints of grapefruit and pineapple. Slightly warming alcohol effect - surprising, given the relatively low ABV for an IPA. Still, it's good. This is one buttery mother. Stout body and nice carbonation.  Dogfish Head has yet to disappoint me. This one has been a staple for awhile, and will continue to be.

Very attractive to look at.  S: Smells of fresh floral hops with a sharp citrus kick. The hops smell very fresh and it's hard to get anything else beyond them.  T: Oh, baby! Those wonderfully perfumed hops are resting gently on a bed of fine pale and caramel malts. Everything comes together wonderfully for a malty grapefruit sort of flavor with a quick clean finish, lingering just a bit with hop bitterness.  M&D: This is so far one of the smoothest, creamiest IPAs I have ever had. The carbonation is fine but plentiful which contributes to a lightness on the tongue. However there is a fantastic creamy texture that arises in the mouth that just makes this slide down so smooth! Love it!

10099,6108,Dukeofearl,4.1,"12 ounce bottle purchased from Merchant Fine Wine in Dearborn Heights, MI. for $1.99 in March 2008.  Pours a dark copper color with a pleasant white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation.  Aroma is piney hops with a whiff of graprefruit. Also light sweet notes.  Flavor is biscuity notes and a very strong piney hop ending. Not quite the real ""chewing on a tree"" time tar hops, but certainly down in that part of the hop spectrum. Very good flavor.  Sharp, crisp, full mouthfeel. It's weakest point is that the nature of the hop profile makes where I wouldn't want to drink much of this at one sitting.

A nice head formed on the beer and it lasted through my drinking of it. It had a bit of a strong taste but not overpowering. It didn't have a pronounced hops/wheat/barley flavor, just a nice combination of them all.

Aroma is clean and hoppy (herbs, citrus) with a touch of sweet malt.  The first sip is all oxidization which oddly disappears after that first taste. Huh. Anyway, sweet malt (caramel?) with some bitter hoppiness at the end. Something Belgiany in there as well, sort of phenolic: a yeast artifact? Has subtle touch of the the typical DFH ""house"" flavor - slightly medicinal maple syrup klinda thing that I actually quite like. Bitterness does not linger long on the finish.  Dry, slightly parching on the tongue.  Well balanced, overall, but the 90 Minute IPA has a surprisingly surperior drinkability over this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Wonderful sour floral hops aroma. Sweet cream, butter and grapefruit-citrus at first, then sour hops and malt, leaving mellowly bitter, coppery afterglow.  This is a really nice IPA for those that love the hops (like me). Well balanced and not overpowering but with great hops character. Absolutely no ""off"" flavors.  There is a real danger of this becoming my everyday beer, displacing homeboy Sweetwater 420.

S: Nice aromas of cut grass, biscuit/toasted malt, citrus, and pine. Interesting to note, as the temp rises the aroma gradually takes on more cirtus and then more pine qualities.  T: Bitter, piney hops and toasted malt dominate. Also noticed were orange, caramel, toasted malt, grass clippings, and a touch of sweet pineapple.  M: Juicy and smooth at the onset.

T: Caramel and pine dominant the initial flavor with a strong, vibrant carbonation that brings things to live. A sweet caramel presence is detected in the middle of the palate.

M: tingly from the strong carbonation with warm caramel, dried citrus and pine coating the tongue.

Taste = Same as the smell, plus nice bittering and aroma hops. Some floral notes (not overwhelming at all). Sweetness seems to come from alcohol, and becomes more noticeable as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel = Very smooth. Light to medium body. A little astringency in the finish.  Drinkability = Pleasantly surprised at first. I'm not a big IPA fan, but found this to be nicely put together and refreshing. My main complaint is that, as the beer warmed up a little bit, an alcohol sort of sweetness became more noticeable and got in the way for my taste (their Raison d'Etre has a very similar taste/smell).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

A thin but very persistent head that chases the beer more than halfway down the glass before quieting.

Never reviewed it apparently, so here goes.  Yellow glowy gold with fluffy head. Clear and sediment free, despite being bottle conditioned. From what I heard though, it's because DFH has it's recipe down so good that they add jsut enough yeast for the co2/conditioning that there's no noticable sediment.  Pine forest with some grepefruit citrus in the nose.  Taste is hoppy with an unexpected yeasty/bready/biscuit flavor. Hops are bright sappy pine needles and a bit of tangerine/grapefruit.

10099,6108,Andrewtherooster,3.9,"This is my first beer review, so here it goes:  Picked this one up at a local store because I've been hankerin' for a solid hop flavor.  Appearance - Poured it from a bottle into a pint glass. A great golden/bronze color. I got a one finger head that lingered throughout the tasting. Some great lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell - Reminds me of a beautiful day in the woods. Piney with a subtle hint of citrus.  Taste - A very balanced taste. The hops come right through and give a nice zest. I was expecting it to be more bitter, but once I got acquainted with it, I enjoyed it greatly. There's definitely a nice lemon quality in the background that helps even out some of the dryness.  Mouthfeel - Very smooth. A little on the thin side, but that may be because of the pour.  Drinkability - I think this has got to be one of my more favorite IPA's. It's a quality brew that I wouldn't be afraid of the aftermath if I had a few. I'm sure the 90 and 120 are much more bitter and intense (and something I definitely need to try), but this is a beer I could see myself grabbing more often, as its great and not entirely challenging.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,FleeVT,3.91,"12oz. brown bottle with born on date poured into a pint glass.  A: An extremely clear beer, golden yellow bordering orange. It has a nice white head that sticks to the glass and a steady slow bead of carbonation. A beaut!  S: Grassy hop aromas let you know this is going to have a bite. A mild malt aroma and faint alcohol finish the nose.  T: Nice and hoppy, just as advertised. Citrus in the form of grapefruit contribute to the complexity. Alcohol makes a brief appearance to give this a beer a clean semi-dry finish. The hops remain a tad longer.  M: Medium to light bodied American IPA with moderate carbonation.  D: A nice offering for DFH. I'd call this is a summer brew and fire up the grill.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,zeff80,4.47,"A - Poured out a golden orange color with a small, white head that left soapy trails of lace.  S - It smelled very hoppy and of roasted malt.  T - It was quite hoppy flavored. It also had a smooth roasted malt taste - like burnt toast and biscuity. There was a nice bittersweet quality.  M - It was crisp and very sharp. A medium-bodied beer.  D - This may be the finest IPA I've ever had. It is easy drinking and delicious.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,explosivebeer,4.38,"Both in the bottle and in the glass, this beer was incredibly clear. It was sweeter and less hoppy than your average IPA, creating a slightly creamy, delicious effect. The aroma was fantastic towards the end of the glass (I drank this beer out of a wine glass) and the aftertaste was excellent. This is an excellent beer that would satisfy beer enthusiasts and possibly serve as a gateway beer for people who only drink domestic lagers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,CrellMoset,3.98,"UPDATE: 01/21/09, scores averaged.  Dogfish Head 60 min, pint glass, Wild Wings café:  Appearance: Arrives a crystal clear, bright, light, tight-bubbled copper-colored brew. The effervescence is plentiful, fairly fast and fine, originating from about two-dozen distinct and separate nucleation sites, streaming upwards towards a surprisingly foamy one-plus finger almost entirely white head. The head retention on this one is above average for the style, much better than I remember, taking about forever and change to fade below half-a-finger. The lacing is similarly big, bold, snow-like, coating the sides of the glass. Quite the crisp and tasty looking brew. 4.5/5.0.  Aroma: Tangy and lightly spicy, with notes of freshly-picked mint, cinnamon, pine, citrus, all over an ever-so-slightly-roasted-but-still-largely-simply-sweet malt groundwork. Pleasant, though it doesn't jump out at me in the same way the taste does. 4.0/5.0.  Taste: Just a great balance. Lined up at the starting line we have the hops: grapefruit; orange; mint; pine; and floral. And they're off! Pulling into an early lead is mint, sharp, quick, light on its feet, cutting through the mildly bitter mid-morning air. But wait, what's this!? It's pine, spicy, heavier but nonetheless a contender, throwing his weight around on the lightly roasted, sweet though crisp track. But don't count out grapefruit and orange - they're well known for sneaking up on you at any moment, biting at your heels and your tastebuds. And here comes floral, never far behind, lurking in the background the whole race - or is it the foreground? He almost seems to float down the track, light, estery, petal-like, drifting, wafting all ghastly and thin though still firm and visible (testable?). All this horserace talk is nonsense, however, because it's in all honesty a photo finish, perfectly, even, perfectly in harmony. Classic and near perfect. 4.5/5.0.  Mouthfeel: Huge effervescence slices its way through a medium body, resulting in a creamy and even yet somehow prickly and fluffy body. It's nice, though perhaps a little overcarbonated. 3.5/5.0.  Drinkability: 4.5/5.0.  *** On tap at Falls Church DFH Alehouse.  Appearance: More formidable head than the last few beers, nice and crisp looking. Serrated, jagged lacing and active carbonation dancing around in a light amber, honey-hued body make it hard to avoid diving in.  Smell: Hops ahoy! Citrus notes are large and in charge here, orange and lemon, and a nice buttery, sweet malt presence makes itself known.  Taste: Hoppy, but not bitter - lemony citrus and piney notes compliment the buttery nuttiness and sweetness of the malt. Awesome balance.  Mouthfeel: Perfectly creamy and carbonated. Very full, very crisp. I have no complaints.  Drinkability: Stellar. My notes actually read ""Great! Perfect! Awesome!"" I was clearly both impressed and mildly tipsy by this point. Still, my observation stands - this is a great sessionable beer.  What hasn't been said about the DFH 60 Minute IPA? Considered one of the best east coast IPAs, and deservedly so, it marries sweet, caramel nutty malts and floral, piney, citrusy hoppy goodness about as perfectly as one could want.

10099,6108,champ103,4.12,"A: Pours a clear gold color. A two finger white head forms that is bubbly and rocky. Decent lace as well. S: Lots of citrus and piney hops. Classic American IPA aroma. Some grapefruit with lots of orange and lemon peal. This smells delicious. T: Plenty of hops, but lots of malt as well. A good balance of citrus fruits and biscuity, nutty, buttery malt. D: Normally I find IPA's a bit hard to drink because of the bitterness. Not with this beer. Don't get me wrong. There is a substantial hop bitterness, but it does not detract from the drinkability. Smooth and easy drinking.  A fine IPA. It is not my favorite style, but I really enjoyed this beer. This is something I will revisit.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,wheelinshirt,4.12,"This is the beer that served as my introduction to craft beer. I've had it enough, i figured i would finally review it. 12 oz longneck brown longneck bottle, cool label, bottled on date (mid january, 08) printed on the neck.  Pours a very clear gold color, seems a bit light for the style and the crystal-like clarity makes it look a bit sterile. Nice white head that retains well and leaves a fair amount of lacing.  Smell is definately hoppy. Lots of citrus notes, pretty classic american hop profile. Taste is fairly bitter, hoppy, some sweet malt in there to balance everything out. I really enjoy this beer.  Mouthfeel is a bit slick from all the hops, but otherwise is good. Carbonation cuts right through the sweet malt to make this one nice and refreshing. Drinkability is good for an IPA. I could drink these all night. Since this was one of, if not the first, craft beer that I had, it will always hold a special place in my heart. It is good and very enjoyable all around, but it is still just an american IPA. I love it, and probably always will, but it isn't going to blow the minds of those who have had dozens of IPAs before.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,morimech,3.21,"Bottled on 12/18/07. Pours a clear, dark golden with a one-fingered head that quickly settles to a thin cap. A nice amount of lacing left on the glass during consumption.  The smell is not what I expected. A combination of musty, biscuit malt and pine aroma from the hops.  The taste is similar. The malt is more pronounced than the hops which is surprising in an American IPA. Leaves a piney aftertaste like cedar. I would rather have the hops upfront than in the aftertaste. It is not horrible but not great in my opinion. Body seems light and carbonation also seems low. The ABV is a little high for the amount of flavor a drinker gets.  For a beer that is a few months old it seems to have lost a lot of the hoppiness that other people rave about in this beer. Other IPAs seem to age a lot better. I better hurry up and drink the rest of the 6pak before it looses any more hop flavor.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Hojaminbag,3.68,"A nice amber color with a small off white head that leaves a little bit of lacing.  Smells hoppy. Pine, floral, grapefruit, hops and more hops.  The first thing I notice is of course hops, of the piney variety. Next it seems more grapefruity, finishing with the dry floral flavors. Throughout the beer, especially in the middle, I notice a nice malt backbone.  Good mouthfeel, standard for the style.  Drinkability is great, a beer that you could drink as long as your wallet will allow you.  This is one of my favorites, it's about time I got around to reviewing it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,cbleary,4.03,"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  The beer poured with a clear pale amber body and had a big white head that left lots of creamy rings of lacing. It smelled of american hops, but was a bit more muted than I would have expected. The taste was very smooth and admirably well-balanced for the style, with the signature Dogfish Head hop oil flavor not overpowering a pleasant blend of malts. I would get it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,lvbs,3.82,"Even our tasters who didn't like IPAs enjoyed this beer and found it drinkable. The hops were pleasantly intense, but balanced out enough by the citrus tones that made it palatable to even those who eschew hop-heavy beers. Hop heads, of course, also liked it. No one gave it a rating below 3, and it received two 5s out of 10 voters.  Overall average: 3.8",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,dnichols,4.13,"I sampled this beer at a local tasting event featuring 17 class brews from east of the Mississippi and Canada.  A: It poured a deep, shiny orange and hazy body with a thick slightly off-white head that lingered and supported a dense lacing.  S: It was dominated by floral hops that were citrusy and fruity. There was also a malty and yeasty aroma.  T: The taste of the creamy, sweet malts dominated. There was a strong armoma of fresh doughy bread and the hops were citrusy and strong but well balanced by the malts.  M: It was creamy and medium bodied with aggressive carbonation and a tangy finish.  D: This was a very drinkable IPA. It was medium bodied, well bananced and it had a modest ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,brendan13,4.39,"A - Fairly clear orangey golden colour with a couple of centimetres of white head. A bit of lacing is left down the glass. S - First thing that hits is the citrus hop notes, passionfruit takes centre stage. Then the piney hoppiness comes out. The hops certainly dominate but in a very good way indeed. T - Citrus and pine hop notes again are pretty dominating but the sweet, slight biscuit maltiness comes through as well. For a very hop-centric beer I didn't find it to be as bitter as what I thought it may be. M - Medium body and carbonation. Slightly sticky. D - I wish I could actually buy this here. It's very tasty (if you like hop driven beers) without being overpowering. Looking forward to the 90 Minute I have waiting in my fridge and one day getting hold of the 120.

There was just something about this beer. I bought a sixer and the first one I enjoyed. But upon further review I do not like this beer. I did not think there was such a thing as to many hops, until I drank this beer.  M- Not thin, but not as heavy as I expected.  D- maybe it is just me this beer bothers me.

The aroma promises good things.  T: The fruitiness from the hops hits first and foremost, but is then balanced by an appropriate amount of malt. Fairly crisp and clean, especially on the finish, but there's a lingering bitterness that tells you to take another sip.  F: The mouthfeel is perfect for this type of beer. It plays around a little due to the good amount of carbonation, but it doesn't distract you. It's smooth and puts taste first.  D: This is one very easy to drink IPA. If you like hops, it's got you covered, but it won't scare anyone away. At each stage of the sip, there is something different offered. It's probably easy to get carried away, but it's just so charming and welcoming while being amply daring.

Very fresh, clean tasting, and surprisingly restrained hops in the taste. Quite easy drinking, and even though it opens up and bitters slightly more as it warms, its still somewhat mild, and has a nice honey sweet malt backing.

Excellent presence of citrusy hops that truly dominate the aroma of this beer. T - A solid malt backbone provides a decent foundation to this IPA. I believe DFH uses warrior, amarillo, and palisades hops in this beer. And you can really get the full effect of the citrus base of these hops. M - This really can be summed up by describing this beer having a full ""IPA"" mouthfeel. A smooth mouthfeel that isnt harsh due to the heavy hops. D - a 6 pack is a must.

The head eventually diminishes to float just on the surface leaving lots of lacing down the glass. The smell is very pronounced, as I think it should be. It's full of pine and citrus notes that are lovely. The grapefruit aroma is complimented by an assertive malt profile followed by subtle yeasty notes. The taste is malty with alot of grapefruit and orange character and the bitterness smacks you in the face as it dances on the back of the tongue.

Overall, a very enjoyable IPA-- one of my favorite. I enjoyed the beer much more on draught than in a bottle, not that I disliked the bottle.

Smells of what I imagine a hop farm would smell like. Flowery, fruity, spicy. Something chalky in the nose to that I can't put my finger on.  Bittersweet. Powerful, yet extremely well balanced. This is a nice session as it's complex, exciting and powerful, yet not overly crazy. Gets more fruity as it warms and some subtle sweetness comes out. Hints of spicy orange. All the way through has the kind of dry bitter finish that makes my mouth water for one more sip.  Mouthfeel is excited. Thick and not watery.

Unlike other reviewers comments, this beer had zero cloudiness or any yeasty residuals floating about ... none. There is some head and retention, mostly bubbly white that fades to the edges of the glass. The carbonation is modest. The smell is very nice. I'm getting nice fresh hops, hoppy resins and esters, piney notes, and sweetish malts to come. The aroma is enticing, but drink on. The taste is quite complex. It begins with some sweetish malts, some citrus, fruitiness in the apricot family. This quickly gets overtaken by a nice hop bite, slightly dry, resinous, with a grassiness imparted as well. There is an underlying sweetness to this beer that balances out the hop bite and this gives the beer its complexity. The beer is overall pretty medium bodied, modestly carbonated, but there is a throaty aftertaste that would lead one to believe there is more ABV than there actually is.

The smell was full of spices with some fruity aromas as well.  The taste was actually better than the smell. You could taste the spices but got a burst of citrus (peaches?) and a hint of bitter sweetness which was nice.

10099,6108,Hatch,4.02,"12oz brown bottle with pry-off top. Freshness date on lable.  Pours a hazy amber/orange with a fluffy white head which retains well for a while, eventually leaving nice lace retention.  Smells strongly of pine and citrus (hops), maybe hints of fresh cut grass clippings, or something to that nature. Also smells of spicy malt.  First taste brings out the spiciness of the malt, a decent bite, not too strong, but definitly not weak, followed by some sweetness and then the pine and citrus of the hops, oily character. A mild bitterness from the hops stains the palate during the aftertaste. The further you get into the drink the more hints of alcohol you pick up, but at all times it's pretty well hidden. This IPA is very balanced and very drinkable; no flavor dominates the other. An excellent session beer!  Notes: If I had to stick a lable on this brew I'd slap on ""mild, balanced, and delicious.""

Overall, a different kind of IPA, its goodness lies in its impeccable balance.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,NitroGen,4.38,": 12 oz brown longneck bottle Dated 10-8-07  A ; Crystal clear light amber pour into a Sam Adams pint glass that filled to the top with a full two fingers of tight brilliant white foam head that slowly settles to a scan cover and lots of lacing until gone.  S: Piney, grapefruit pith, grains at the end.  T: Smooth and slightly sweet that ends with a really nice bite of hops. While the hops are not bitter, they kick the mouth to alert that a great tasting experience is ahead. Subtle grapefruit pith that settles to a very nice grain aftertaste.  M: A great mouth and aftertaste experience to be enjoyed by everyone who wants a big beer experience.  D: I count on this as one of my great session beers, as it continually keeps the mouth alert when drinking more than one, and is a great tasting brew throughout an afternoon/evening.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,dickieb,4.22,"Pours a clear golden with an average head and some excellent lacing. The smell is piny bitter hops, and some hints of grainy malts. The taste again features the piny hops, but with hints of lemon and a fairly well balanced effort from the malts. The mouthfeel and drinkability are spot on for a heavy session beer. Defiantly an IPA i use to judge others against, balanced easy to come across, and one of my first.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,JoeyBeerBelly,4.5,"12oz bottle, served in a pint glass.  This beer is a clear, golden yellow color with a big fluffy white head that leaves loads of sticky lacing on the glass.

It's light bodied with crisp carbonation, and can very easily be sessioned.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Hoppington,3.5,"I have to admit - I have a soft spot in my heart for this beer. This is the beer that really got me into IPAs. Extreme amounts of hops and malt, and the the balance is, arguably, spot on! I have found it to be consistent, both in bottle and on-tap, though surprisingly, my favorite beer bar had it on-tap on week (after much begging from yours truly), but it didn't taste right to me. Tasted more like DFHs Shelter Pale Ale, so I think they got a mislabeled keg. But I am often in Delaware on business and frequently go to the DFH pub in Rehoboth.  Update: DFH 60 Minute doesn't taste right to me anymore. I don't know why this is, but it just doesn't have the hoppy citrusy zing anymore - even at the DFH Pub in Rehoboth. I think they changed their recipe - it just isn't the same beer. I stick with DFH 90 these days.  Hey DFH - what happened?!!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,madjr80,3.97,This will clearly open your senses right at the first sip. It is going to be something you love or hate instantly. A great deal of flavor in this brew.

Cask conditioned would be perfect for this brew.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Taste: Bitter with citrus flavors (excellent flavor for an IPA).  Mouthfeel: This was my first letdown - it explodes in your mouth almost as if it was overcarbonated. Definitely was a hard brew for me to swallow.  Drinkability: The mouthfeel prevented the drinkability from being higher - the taste is outstanding but it isn't a beer I could drain right away.

10099,6108,woodychandler,3.85,"Paul Pendyck of the GEN Sutter Inn in Lititz asked me if I had the kind of contacts at DFH that would enable him to get some 60"" IPA in a cask for the third of his Last Friday real ale events. Do I have those contacts? Mais oui. I spoke to Sam, who put me onto Bryan Selders and then I put Paul and Bryan together.  It was presented to me with a thick, bone-white head. The nose had a peach quality to it. Mouthfeel was more thin than creamy. Lots of hops in the mouth, but less sharp than when I have had this beer on-tap. The finish had a decent hop presence, but not in an overwhelming way. I was especially surprised by the lack of presence on the malt. I'll stick to it on-tap.  We had it again last night (F, 30 Jan 2009) and people were clamoring for me to write and post a review. This marked the anxiously awaited return of General Sutter Inn's Cask Night following a two-month Holiday Hiatus!  It came with a finger of sudsy foam with decent retention. The color was a beautiful deep-golden amber with NE-quality clarity that just screamed ""BEER!""  In fact, it put me in mind of the ""Mad"" # 18 parody of Howdy Doody entitled ""Howdy Dooit!"" on page 3 (and I quote):  ""Hi, Mom! Having trouble making the kids drink milk? Why don't you try some BUPGOO? BUPGOO is a syrup that when added to milk makes the milk more attractive to children! BUPGOO works on the principle that children want what they cannot have. You see, BUPGOO in milk makes the whiteness rise foaming to the top of the glass, leaving a transparent brown liquid underneath. Yes, BUPGOO makes a glass of milk look EXACTLY like a glass of BEER! Next time the kids want that beer you're drinking, give 'em BUPGOO!"" Har.  Mouthfeel was silky smooth with a highly grassy taste on the tongue. Finish had just a lightly malty taste, just enough to remind me, as a hophead, that my palate has evolved to the point that this is now simply a warm-up/appetizer.  Now cue my mom, c. 1987 describing me to a friend of hers as being ""the most jaded person [she had] ever met."" Har, redux!  My original review(s) were for this as a cask-conditioned beer. Since then, my wish has come true: Sam Calagione has deigned to put his beers into CANs! This is my first entry for the Fourth of CANuly 2017.  From the CAN: ""Our East Coast IPA continually hopped with a slew of Northwest hops throughout the entire boil for a powerful, citrusy hop character.""; ""Off-Centered Ales for Off-Centered People.""  The Crack! was so utterly loud that I could not CANstrain myself & so I performed an inverted Glug. I watched in stunned horror as the head rushed up, seemingly unCANtrollably, reaching the lip of the glass & stopping, as if by an unseen hand. This resulted in the creation of two fingers of foamy, rocky, tawny head with decent retention that left great lacing in its wake as it fell. Color was solid Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity & the BUPGOO analogy still certainly fits. Nose was maltier than I remember, very biscuity, with a minty hoppiness to go with it. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, big for the style. The taste was as I now think of it - much hoppier than anything else when it was first released, but now a pale imitation when CANpared to its later iterations (75"", 90"", even 120""). Still, it was plenty hoppy and enough to satiate this self-avowed, self-described hophead. Finish was bone-dry & I needed a sip of water along with a hit from my asthma inhaler to recover. Phew.  Finally, on Sa, 03 Nov 2018, I have a Bottle to close out this merry-go-'round.  From the Bottle: ""Our East Coast IPA continually hopped with a slew of Northwest hops throughout the entire boil for a powerful, citrusy hop character.""  I Pop!ped the cap & began a slow, gentle C-Line pour into the awaiting glass. It seemed rather eager, so I stepped up my game. This resulted in just under two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head with very good retention that left some nice lacing at which I marveled in its wake. Color was Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity, prompting an impromptu visit from The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Croesus & Midas. Nose was citrusy, very much of grapefruit. but with a subtle smokiness. Hmm. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, not watery, but not much beyond it, either. The taste was like a muted bitterness, somewhere north of pineapple, but south of grapefruit. Sadly, I was not getting the (even) light smokiness of the nose. I remember really digging this when it was first released, but now, I am kinda cold. It simply lacks Ooomph! This, Mr. Sam Calagione, is the high price of success. You have created a top-of-the-line product, only to leave it in the dust in the name of innovation. Hmm.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

S- Hops and more hops, in a good way.  T- The hops surprisingly don't dominate in a bitter way. Instead they dominate in a piney, very flavorful way with a decent dry finish.

UGLY bottle label... label looks like moldy wall paper. I guess this is their attempt at leaving a homebrew feel intact, but c'mon...  A- 1 1/2 finger head.. light carbonation. A light honey bronze that's slightly cloudy. Lacing dribbles down the side of the glass and then dissapears.  S- HOPS... Hops for sure... but there's a slight fruit aroma... orange peel? Give it a wiff.. smells like orange peel to me.  T/M- HOPS!... Delicious delicious hops... slightly more pine than citrus, but both are present and pleasing. The malt hits the tongue a second or so later. Very well balanced taste.... nothing too strong, and nothing in the flavor that I don't like. The aftertaste is long lasting and pleasantly dissolves into a tingly warmth on the tongue.  D- I could drink this all night... It's a very well balanced American IPA that can be sipped slowly or consumed more generously in a social setting.  Overall... Mmmhmmm.... This brew went great with cheese...

10099,6108,cswhitehorse,3.92,The 60 minute pours a clear almost lager color with a quickly dissipating foam head. I did not see any freshness date on the bottle. The smell was a nice citrusy aroma. The taste was balanced with a cookie maltness on the backend. It was very thin for me in the mouth. Overall a good IPA.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,L4t3rg4t3r,4.1,"Appearance: Nice light amber with a pillowy head that slowly dissipates leaving a thin white lacing on the glass  Smell: Hops and muted Pine Needles  Taste: A very nice combination of hops and malt with the hops prevailing at the end. Also has a little bit of that piney character and hop bitterness on the tail.  Mouthfeel: Nice and solid, not to heavy, but not to light either...just right.  Drinkability: One of my favorite sessioners, I could drink this often and never grow tired of it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,MillRat,3.59,"Crystal clear golden yellow with just a hint or red. Head is barely present, and then plain gone. By appearance, I wondered I grabbed a bottle with a leak and beer was nearly flat. Very nice left-coast hop aroma with a mellow topping of pine and citrus. Not overwhelming. Malt aroma in the far background. Like the aroma, the flavor is all about the hops, with the malt tethering the whole presentation to terra firma. The malt body really wants to make itself at home on your tonsils, but the hops now come to rescue and chase it off. Overall not a session beer, but that's not what an american IPA is about. For what it is it's quite drinkable, even if that means you stop at two or three instead of one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Lothore,4.14,"A- Pours a clear, reddish yellow color with a tiny head that fades quickly. Very few carbonation bubbles evident.  S- Very dominate smell, sweet and malty with a piney hop character hidden behind the sweetness.  T- Sweet to begin with, roasted flavor with a slight hopiness at the end. I thought with this beer, the 60 was better flavor wise than the 90 because the additional hops just did not seem to behove it (90 min).  M- A bit thick with a medium amount of carbonation.  D- This is very drinkable and would be easy to session. More toned down and perhaps better balanced version than the 90 min.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,mat5175,3.35,"Great light amber color. Nice head initially that fades pretty quickly, but does leave some lacing that seems to last a while.  Spciy and floral nose, great clean hops.  This has a great flavor that is not only representative of the type, but compares favorably to other great beers in the category. The flavor profile has the usual hop bitterness, but isn't overpowering. Some citrus throughout. Not quite as clean as 471 from Breckenridge. A great IPA, that is well balanced.  60 Minute is light on the palate and refreshing when nice and cold with lively carbonation.  The hops get to be too much for me after about two of these.

10099,6108,becktone,4.06,"Eye: Couldn't ask for a better pint of beer. This is perfect. Nice large head with excellent retention. Color is golden and the brew is crystal clear. As I said before, this is a model for the way any pale type of ale should look.  Nose: Pretty nice nose on this brew. Great malt backbone as well as some roasted/toasty aromas coming through. Also some graininess. Of course as with all IPAs there is a strong hop presence. The hops are floral and include some spice in the aroma. I would prefer something a bit stronger from the hops, the aroma seems to lean more towards the toasty malts, perhaps it'll change as it warms.  Tongue: Hop bitterness makes itself known right from the get go. Flavor of the hops is spicy and floral. There is a good balance between the spiciness offered from the hops and the toasty flavor from the malts. The graininess also comes through in the flavor helping to give some semblance of balance to the brew. Overall a good IPA, I've had what I would subjectively say is better-in my opinion could use a bit more hop flavor and bitterness....but hey that's what 90 and 120 minute are for. However, you still can't go wrong with this.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied on the palate with appropriate levels of carbonation, it does not get in the way of the overall body or the flavor of this brew. The finish is semi-dry. This is a beer I'd definitely buy again. A really great brew, not quite as hoppy as 90 minute and definitely not as hoppy as 120 minute, it seems to me that this would be a ""crossover"" IPA for someone that was used to APAs but not really IPAs. Overall a great offering from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

As the head settled down, the lacing was thick and clumpy down the side of the glass. The beer itself is a golden honey color.  The nose on this is fairly pronounced. A good balance between piney hops and a a toasted malt with a bit of caramel.  The taste: Just like the smell! Nice, piney hops dominates early but a thick tasty malt balances things off well.  Mouthfeel: Nice, thick and robust. Just a bit high on carbonation.... too fizzy for my taste... But a good IPA.  Drinkability: I only got a single this time.... but the overall sensation of this ale warrents at least a sixer next time....

10099,6108,TheTrevor,4.07,"I heard good things about this beer so I decided to pick up a bottle at the local Beerporium. After pouring it I was greeted by the pleasant smell that reminded me very much of malts. There was about a quarter of an inch head and it was a light brown color. There was a decent amount of lacing and the first taste I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting an overwhelming amount of hops and a bitter finish, but instead the taste is very smooth and has there was no unpleasant aftertaste. The hops are definitely there but not obtrusively so. I tend to favor beers with less hops but this one may enter my regular rotation. The carbonation was pleasant and maybe even a bit mild. As far as drinkability I'd probably be able to put back four or five, but I think I'd much rather just sit and enjoy them one at a time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Bitterness of the hops stays on the tongue. Mostly bitter, earthy taste. Kind of an after-bite of bitterness.  Light and smooth mouthfeel. Not a lot of carbonation. Thin  Not too bad. It seems to be a very simple IPA. There's not a lot of complexity in the smell or taste. It's light feel is almost like a lager. I had higher expectations.

The nose is stricken by honey-sweetness, crisp and hoppy. The standout feature of the taste is the clarity, honey & hops wash away without a trace. Remarkable...

With the words ""continuously hopped"" on the label, I expected an explosion of hop aroma. I was pleasantly surprised.  T: The hops are surprisingly subdued and balanced with the beer. It's an interesting flavor. The hops have a bitterness that reminds me of roasted coffee. Sounds strange, I know, but that's what popped into my head. It finishes bitter in the back of the throat.  M: Maybe a little thin.  D: Smooth, but not too bitter.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Smixam,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into pint glass.  A: Nice golden, bit darker than a traditional IPA, light 1 finger head, nothing crazy but very appealing.  S: Not as strong as you would think for a 'true' IPA (as I consider this to be). Very nice, not overpowering, all hop-scent. Hint of floral but mostly a strong pine.  T: A great craft IPA. It's all hops and that's what makes it great. Maybe a hint of malt in the finish, but its a very nice bitter hop flavor almost throughout. Leaves a medium bitter aftertaste, and you can really feel the hops throughout your pallet and in your nose. Great tasting brew.  M: Very good again; no metallic tones that sometimes come in IPAs, not overly bitter, just enough for a nice dry mouthfeel.  D: Pretty good for a medium bodied IPA like this; not my first choice for a long session, but great with meals or kicking back for a bit. Relatively high ABV could catch you off guard - you really can't tell from the taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

As it warms, I'm getting a piney scent.  T/M: Very tasty piney hop bitterness with enough malt to balance it out. Getting a slight lime undertone; just enough to m ake you think ""pucker"" but not enough to do so. Nice lighter mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Finishes nice and dry.

10099,6108,tapman,4.15,"A- Has a brown/golden appearance, like an antique gold. Not quite as pale as other pale ales. Pretty cool.  S- Not super hoppy as one would expect. Has a bready/melba toast aroma. A wheat bread aroma also is thrown into the mix. Malts are difficult to pin down exactly which is very nice.  T- Tangy hops combine with sweet barley malts. I appreciate that the hops are not too cascade-like; hops are dry, almost wine-like, and bitter. Hops are not grassy, but sour which goes so well with the sweet malts. Sweet and sour beer.  M- Carbonation is bubbly and sharp adding a distinct body to a brew whose style is generally pretty light. Refreshing and thin, the higher alcohol (sugar) content puts this one above average.  D- A malty IPA!!! DFH does some out-there beers, but there is a reason why their IPAs are the staple and come in 6-packs instead of 4-packs and are priced a little more reasonably. A malt-mouths IPA... brazen you say, but innovations like this are the reason why DFH s leading the craft beer revolution. Here's to the craft beer's golden age.

Not a very strong aroma, but the taste soon made up for it.  The description on the label of the bottle as ""continually hopped"" pretty much describes the bulk of this beer's flavor, since the hops dominate nearly every aspect of every taste. It leaves a very crisp, clean feeling bitterness lingering on the back of your tongue, throat, and even on your lips that lasts for a while after each sip. Literally mouthwatering.

Good sense of hops at the moment you swallow. very clean after-taste, just enough to get you to take another sip. Again, the taste isn't very complicated. For some reason I want to say buttery, but that seems silly so i'll just toss it out there. Its a very comfortable taste, don't have to work for it, its there, its not throwing any curve balls, and it agrees with you. Draw your own parallels.

This really is the consummate American IPA, with a large helping of American hops, but nothing that is overbearing or distracting. There are citrus and pine flavors to go along with the flowery notes. And, unlike their 90 minute (which is also good as a DIPA) the malt is not overpowering, but rather subtle, stern, and appreciated. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and oily. Finish is dry.

Appearance- Pours a clear amber-yellowish. Nice one finger size head that slowly disapaites and leaves a bubbly cap and collar. Lots of aggressive carbonation and beautiful lacing. Smell- Big, pungent piney-floral hop that smells fantastic. Very earthy and vibrant, like a IPA should smell. Very light caramel sweetness trys to show but is pretty much owned by the delicious hops. Taste- Starts pretty bitter but is pretty much overtaken by the sweet toffee malt. Totally not what I was expecting, especially after the smell. The hop that is there is slightly piney and bitter grapefruit. Finishes semi-bitter after the sweetness wears off. Mouthfeel- Medium body with a thin syrupiness to it. Pringly, aggressive carbonation. Drinkability- This is pretty tasty stuff but not really as hoppy as I was hoping. Its not quite on the same level as say Stone IPA, Two Hearted Ale, Inversion IPA or even Sweetgrass IPA (although its much closer to this then the aforementioned three).

The smell is nice oily hops not just the usual citrusy hoppiness either it is a bit deeper here pretty piney as a matter of fact, it is actually quite refreshing for an American IPA. The taste is interesting the bitterness is on the high side but the hop flavor is subdued and I'm really only getting a lot of hoppy oily flavor. The malt flavor may be just a bit too light for this beer but since the bitterness isn't such a quick punch to the mouth like many other IPAs it doesn't really leave you looking for more malt. Mouthfeel is better than decent almost syrupy thick surprisingly thick for an IPA but again it works in this case. For an IPA with bitterness this high this beer is also surprisingly drinkable like I've said before this is a different kind of IPA, different in a good way it makes me wish some more American brewers would mix it up a bit and bring us a bit more with their IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Just a subtle hop character hits. A little of the malt flavor comes through.  T - Interesting flavor here - starts with more of a malt flavor, and then slowly transitions to a bitter hop note. Generally not a strong flavor. I do actually enjoy the aftertaste here, which seems to be the acid of the hops.  M - Has a smooth mouthfeel to it. Carbonation is generally light. Feels like good quality.  D - It flows down nicely for me. Its an interesting change of pace. I could drink one or two of these.

Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass dark gold. Very attractive 1-inch head that fades rather quickly. Smells of very light hops and a hint of citrus, but not overwhelming the nostrils. Probably not the most appealing scented beer, but still calls to be drunk. The taste was a pleasant surprise. Light hops taste with some hints of citrus, and amazingly light on the palette. Medium-bodied and not too carbonated. Overall, wonderful beer and probably a great IPA to start off with.

Tastewise the pine hops and a citrus, grapefruit like taste are present. As the beer warms, a malty sweetness becomes more apparent. A hint of spice is also present. Very good balance here. Finishes clean. Has a full bodied, crisp and smooth mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink, especially as it warms up a bit. I think this beer is an excellent example of the style.

10099,6108,zdk9,3.6,"A good standard AIPA. Bright piney hops flavors combine with slightly carmel maltiness. But the hops are the real winners in this combination. Bitterness is great for style, though slightly too much for my mouth at this time. And while the lacing is great, the color is kinda yellow and doesn't give the best impression to my eyes. All in all a beer I would enjoy again, but would probably choose it's big brother beers first over it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Maybe I'm not a fan of IPA's in general....that being said this drink is somewhat enjoyable and goes down pretty well, I just don't like the taste I get which makes me shy away from the drink.

Taste is alive with hop oils and a little bit of citrus and pine needles. This brew is thick and in your face with a nice grapefruit-like aftertaste.

The most important part of this ""continually hopped India Pale Ale"" made by the people who proudly claim that they make ""off centered ales for off centered people"" is how it tastes. I dunno what kind of weird experiments the Dogfish Head brewmasters out in Delaware are doing to their hops but I hope they keep doing it. GRAPEFRUIT!!! That's what I'm tasting? It's all about the hops here and they have have this total sour-n-sweet smack and a sharp and spicy yet somewhat clean finish. Tart yet sweet...Bitter yet sparkling. If you're one of those people who likes the balance and complexities between the hops and malt this may not be your thing but if you're not afraid of hoppy zing as I am but sometimes feel that a twist and turn needs to be thrown into the works every now and then this 6%er totally hits the spot.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

I can't quite place the aroma...it's almost neutral, perhaps a hint of toasted grain?  This beer tastes great; with crisp, cedary hop flavors that work well with the simple toasted malt flavors. A touch of orange citrus hops character comes out after this warms up. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth enhancing the overall experience. The clean and balanced finish enhances drinkability, but lacks the bitter smack of hops that one would expect in an IPA.  Overall, a very clean, drinkable IPA that lacks complexity, but scores high in its drinkability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

S-Piney/grapefruity soapy hops and a twinge of malt sweetness.  T-Crisp up front with the grapefruit hops hitting on the follow through. Goes from sweet to bitter to very bitter on the aftertaste, maybe slightly soapy but very refreshing. the toasted malt sweetness comes out with the pretzels I am eating.  M-Creamy and rich, on the thicker side with a tight carbonation that is damned near perfect.  D-This is an above average IPA, a great beer that can be sessioned.

S: Grapefruit rind, cantelope, little bit of watery OJ, basic breadiness with just a hint of pine in the lows.  T: Begins sort of watery with a mild orange juice sweetness. A hint of lime zest prowls through with a caramel base ensuing quickly. Little bit of dirty pine bitterness with some metallic aspects.

Regardless, it is a beautiful light brown color I love to see in my IPAs. Smells citrusy and hoppy, but not as downright sexy as I'd like. On first sip the sweetness hits big and the hops follow it up bigger, which suddenly drop out for half a second and then come back big again. COOL. I like that, almost makes me forget about the big sweetness up front (I hate that). The beer goes down ultra smooth. Great mouthfeel, no doubt about it. Not my favorite IPA but worth a try nonetheless. Definitely one of the better ones out there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Sticky lacing marks the glass after each sip.  Good, hoppy aroma. Cirtus, floral, some lighter caramel to help balance it. It's an IPA and it smells like one.  I love the flavor of this one...maybe it's because it's one of the first IPAs that made me say say ""damn...I love these hop things"". The hops show up in a broad range of flavors from citrus to floral to pine. Just enough malt sweetness to make it really enjoyable and to keep from looking like that guy in the old Keystone Light commercials. You know the ones...""bitter beer face"".  Nice medium body with average carbonation. Drying, slightly bitter aftertaste has me longing for another sip. These go down so easily, especially on-tap, that I can get into some trouble if I am not careful.

Good head with a thick white lacing that hugs the glass.  Floral hop is big on the nose. Malts are present along with a musky yeast smell.  Lots of hop burn, with oil and herbal notes. The malts hold there own against the hops. The yeast gives a nice alcohol note. The finish is bitter from all the hops. Not surprising, but very welcome.  Great IPA.

10099,6108,woemad,3.68,"12oz bottle purchased at Huckleberry's in Spokane for $1.89. It seems to have become a regular offering, as it's been available for several months now. No freshness date.  The beer poured a hazy orange-copper color with a big off-white head that took some time to drop. Sheets of lace were left on the sides of my EWU pintglass.  Not surprisingly, the nose was hoppy. I got hints of lemon and peppery spices, along with a bready maltiness in the background.  The first flavor that hits the taste buds is an herbal hop bitterness. The lemon-like citrus flavor noted in the smell is more restrained in the taste. Once again, the bready malts can be tasted in the background. This tasted good, but not as good as the nose. It seemed like a better balance could do wonders for this beer.  The body seemed to me to be a litle too light. The mouthfeel was moderately oily, but less so than many IPAs I've had in the past.  A good IPA, but not one that blows my socks off. All things considered, I'd rather have the 90 Min.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

It has a constant stream of bubbles that rise to the surface of the glass.  Smell - Slight scent of hops and the tiniest bit of malt. Extremely bready. Also the scent of grains, something grassy.  Taste - The first taste is an immediate hop bite. Though immediate, it is not overpowering, and is very well balanced with the malt. Tastes like citrusy liquid hop bread.  Mouthfeel - Great level of carbonation. Slight dry feel in the finish. Light to medium bodied.  Drinkability - Very good. Goes down very smooth and is easily sessionable at 6% ABV.

The 60 Minute pours a clear amber with a frothy head that sticks around, leaving lace all the way down the glass. To the nose, it betrays pine and citrus hops with traces of grain that are present as well in the taste. It's not too bitter like many IPAs, the hoppiness is more aromatic and at the edges of your palate rather than the donkey-punch many deliver. At the end a faint maltiness that blends well with the outdoorsy hops and it doesn't feel like you're left with IPA dragon-breath. It is clear and refreshing feeling in the mouth, light, it's not going to coat your mouth or anything, and at 6%, I could drink these all day and all night.

10099,6108,MiScusi,3.54,"This would be my 200th review here. A little worried because I obtained this in a trade and the bottle leaked every so slightly. The outside and label were soaked with a bit of beer, but the cap did not looked damage and the beer was still filled up into the neck of the bottle.  A- a clear rich golden with an airy bubbly soft head, which dwindled down to a light cap after a few minutes.  S- The hops are more of the earthy/spicy type.  T- This is a great, and easy drinking IPA. A nice light malty and caramel taste hit the mid-sip and the hops finish it off. Mild bitterness left after the sip that hangs around in the back of the mouth.  M- Carbonation is still fine in this beer. Not abrasive at all and works well with the lighter medium body.  D- Doesn't kill your palate so this can be drank for quite a while.  ____ Bought a 6 pack that was a month old (still generally fresh to me). The hops still have the same earthy/spicy character but the taste has a bit too much of a sweetness and gives off that grainy impression.

The aroma is quite hoppy, a mix of citrus and herbs. The initial flavor is moderately bitter and yet a hint of sweetness. It finishes slightly bitter, from the amount of hops no doubt, and is short in duration.

S: Citric hops dominate, with mostly tangerine and orange smells, some grapefruit.  T: The taste is solid for an IPA, citrus hops, balanced by a toffee, buttery malt, this borders on an English style IPA, but the American presence is evident.  M: Smooth, good amount of carbonation, good heft.

10099,6108,jdoncbus,4.3,"Another beer I have enjoyed for a few years and for some reason never reviewed.  Bought a six pack and poured one bottle into a pint glass. Golden color with two finger head. Somewhat bubbley with moderate lacing.  Sweet hops. Orange-lemon smell with a faint pine, alcohol twist.  When the drink hits your lips and enters your mouth, its crisp and clean. The flavor is followed up with the sour/bitter and floral hops where it also exposed some toasty malt. The mouthfeel is nice & mellow, dryness in the mouth with that somewhat piney resin feel.  This was one of my early gateway brews into the IPA realm. I could drink the 60 Minute all night long.

10099,6108,pmcadamis,4.25,"A - Big bone white three finger head with some massive crater-forming bubbles on top. The brew itself is a very slightly hazy coppery ""new penny"" hue and has quite a few fine bubbles rushing to the top. As the fluffy head settles, it leaves tons of fine eggshell lace on the glass, and the head never dips below a finger while a swirl brings up a solid two fingers.  S - Firm and fresh citrus and pine hop aromas. The citrus component leans heavily toward the sweet mandarin orange range, while the piny scents are more subdued. There is not much of a malt backbone other than the sugary nuances of that canned mandarin orange syrup aroma.  T - Again, big canned mandarin orange flavors dominate the palate with extremely sweet citrus flavors. The hops seem even less piny and even more sweetly citric here. The malt presence is much more apparent in the mouth than in the nose...it's a dead ringer for the sugary syrup that's left in the can of mandarin oranges when the fruit is gone...it even has a bit of that metallic flavor.  M - Medium bodied with a low level of carbonation and a dusty off-dry finish. The mandarin orange flavor lingers on for several tasty minutes after swallowing.  D - There isn't a damn thing wrong with this beer. I expected it to be a bit more ""in your face"" given the outlandishness of DFH's other brews, but this is eminently drinkable and quite tasty, if a bit sweetish.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,GRPunk,4,"Bottle poured into a pint glass.  A- It poured clearish, straw yellow with a very thin, off-white head that all but disappeared moments after pouring. Decent lacing was left behind and there was medium carbonation.  S- Definite pine aroma, but not over-powering. The hops were blended well with somewhat of a sweeter malt scent (caramel, maybe roasted almonds).  T- Much of the same. Decent balance between the more noticible pine of the hops and sweeter malts.  M- Very nice. There is a bite from the hops and a nice amount of carbonation.  D- Very drinkable. I could drink a couple of these in a single sitting.  Overall- Nothing is overdone with this beer. While the hops are fully on display, they do not dominate or overwhelm the malty characteristics. I've become a bigger fan of American IPAs as of late and really enjoy this one. On a day I don't want to be taken aback by hops, this would be a beer I would consider.  D-",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

I didn't watch the pour, so I don't know if the bar-tender poured off some head or not.  I thought this was bottle-conditioned, but the draught version was a perfectly clear amber. The white head faded slowly to a ring that left good lacing.  Smell was walnutty-hazelnutty floral hops over a caramel malt base. Complex and good. Some crackers and a hint of bread dough. Lots of pine hops too.  Taste followed the smell to a ""T."" The buttery-nutty acetyls are all there along with the pine hops and floral hops. The crackers and caramel malt are there as well. Nice peppery finish with the long pine-hop bitterness.  Nice round mouthfeel. There is plenty of hop-oil and a decent malt foundation.  Drinkability is still somewhat diminished for me by the long bitterness of the aftertaste. I know that's exactly to style, but I would have to switch to something else before drinking a second one of these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,mdm46410,3.94,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaker. This IPA poured a clear golden amber color with a decent sized rocky head that slowly faded away. Some ok lacing was left behind. The aroma consisted of bright citrus and pine notes, followed by a hint of caramel. The flavor was an excellent balance of sweet fruit, caramel, and hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel was lightly resiny and medium-bodied. Lightly carbonated. Just right for an everyday beer. Not to over the top, but definately not boring.

S - Heaven for a hop-head... hops, hops, and more hops... a blending of both bitter citrus and pine.  T - Once again, hops comes forward strongly... what I like about the hoppiness of this beer is the roundness of the hop character. flowery and piney.  M - coats your mouth with a tingly hoppiness.  D - This beer is such a fantastic session beer. Except for those who are totally against bittering hops, it's a wonderfully drinkable beer.

Plenty hoppy for your hop fix, but the malts aren't marginalized. Just had a fresh one in the bottle, and if you get it on tap, it's even more punchy. It was a little more lively when it was bottle conditioned, but it's still a great-tasting beer, and one of the definitive American IPAs.  M, D - Near perfect, though not as hop-oily as some other American IPAs, like Great Divide Titan. However, the fact that it's not as oily as that really helps drinkability to me. It would be tough for me to session Titan, however great I know it is, but this is really one I can have plenty of. The 6% ABV won't kill you.

10099,6108,boelker62,3.65,"Pours a white, DFH-like rocky head over a sparkling amber body. This brew is a flagship staple for DFH, and holds onto all the charactersistics of the brand. It has that wonderful, deeply citrusy, and lightly perfume hop nose, while providing in the nose, even, a notice to all, that balance is the key to this brew. The taste is on style, and complex enough to call it a great beer, but not not so much to pull away from the drinkability and mouthfeel factor. This is the beer, for an IPA guy or not, that you should have a case in the cooler, served well chilled IMO that everyone can appreciate. It is a greatly unobtrusive or oppresive IPA that can be had for a long night, or just with dinner. Sam really nailed this one down.

Very earthy hop aroma, and oddly enough, I could sort of smell alcohol even though it's not a very high ABV.  Hint of grapefruit hop flavor, but mostly earthy/bitter/herbal hops - reasonably assertive, but not extremely assertive. Very balanced. A seemingly shy bit of caramel malt makes its way to the palate as well. But, as expected/hoped, the hops do overall dominate.  Perfect carbonation, no alcohol heat on the tongue - but a little bit in the stomach. In a good way.  An easy-to-drink brew for folks like me who usually drink pretty strong stuff. Almost seems more like an APA than an IPA, but whatever it is, it's good.

The piney aroma freatures dry-hopped, slighty woody and nutty character. The herby flavor dominated by strong pine, some acidic citrus, and a dry, woody finish.  It's medium-bodied and demonstrates decent complexity. A flavorful, hopped-brew that's drinable and not overwhelming.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Manosbeeroffate,4.24,"I thought I had reviewed this before, but I guess not. Easy to find locally. Pours a yellow color with a slight green tinge?? Smells better than it looks. Tastes even better, very hoppy, nice honey malt sweetness and finishes bitter again.

10099,6108,AChamberlain,4,"Brown bottle (12oz) from Park Slope Food Coop in Brooklyn. Solid. A great beer to have year round. You should always have these at hand. Pours reddish gold with a nice half inch head. Hops in the aromas, nice. Hops in the flavor, nice. Fresh and zesty. Great balance in flavor, smell and mouthfeel. Very easy to drink, great to session. 60 min. IPA is hard to beat.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,DavidSeanNJ,4.12,First time reviewing this beer. I have purchased this numerous times.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass.  Nice golden color- the head was amazing- about a half inch- very fluffy and light. Smelled of citrusy hops- very potent and fresh- almost zesty. The 60 Min hops are quite distinct- more sweet than bitter.  This particular bottle of 60 min IPA did not contain the strong hop flavor that im used to although they were definitely very present. This one gets better as it warms and the hop character improves with every sip.  American IPA's are my favorite style and this one is definitely great but not top notch IMO. It's lacking the bite that I'm used to with IPA's. Will buy this one again though.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,penguinjive7,4.33,"Pours a golden straw color with a substantial foamy head.  Smell is of citrusy hops with mild floral notes as well.  The taste is initially of citrus, specifically oranges and grapefruit. Some malts kick in after rolling it around and provide some sweetness to balance the hops. The finish is a very smooth blend of all of these elements.  This is a very smooth brew even with the large amount of hops; very balanced. I could have several of these and not get tired of it. Very well done. A rather different IPA and I would have to say one of my favorites.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,scott,4.13,"V.07 A beautiful soapy head graces the top of this gorgeous and highly carbonated golden apricot colored beverage. Sweet citrus, ripe pineapple & mild hop elegantly play as far as aromatics are concerned. Luckily, the nose is not fraudulent, and the taste is welcomed with open arms. Very enjoyable, and quite the easy drinker. Slick and mildly mouth coating, this will not deter you from wanting another. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,phisig137,4.3,"Pours a mid-amber, light orange color with a creamy one finger head. decent retention leaves behind nice lacing.  Aroma is moderately hoppy, quite resinous, and filled with smooth pine and citrus hop aromas. Mild, but quite nice.  Flavor is great. Fantastic balance between the malt and hops. Only a slight amount of crystal malts is present up front, and the finish is dominated by the hops, with a very smooth, clean bitterness. All the usual suspects of the ""C"" hops seem to be present. Well carbonated, this has a moderate mouthfeel, and excellent drinkability.  Truly, a fantastic IPA. This is what I think of when I think IPA.... well made and well balanced. I love it because it isn't just a huge hop bomb. I love the hops, but save them for the DIPA's and barleywines. This is what a standard IPA should be in my mind. Granted, I do think that this was better in the past, and more recently seems to have picked up a bit of a metallic hop twang, but it's still a great everyday beer. DFH just doesn't disappoint. This is one beer that is well worth all the attention it gets.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Orrshow,4.2,Appearance  Pours a clear golden yellow color with a centimeter of off white foamy head. A little lacing is left as the beer is downed.  Smell  Dominated by hops off the start. Very strong citrus and pine aromas arise with slight amounts of malt to follow. The citrus hops just power this one though with lemon being prevalent. Very nice.  Taste  First impression is all hops. There are lots of citrus and pine flavors like in the smell with a bitter finish. Some bread malt flavor arises too but it is slight as the hops just dominate. It reminds a little of the time I put a cascade pellet in my mouth.  Mouthfeel  Full bodied with a slightly oily feeling. The carbonation is little tingly.  Drinkability  Good but many would find the hops overpowering. I do not as I am a hophead.  A bit thanks to elricorico for sharing. Great beer!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,ttu94,4.47,Pours out a clear golden color. Very small head. I belive this is probably from the hop oils as I think they inhibit large long lasting heads. Smell is great with lots of hops and citrus aromas. This beer is loaded with flavor. The first thing you taste is the hops then a grapefruit flavor followed by malts. Tastes good and warm. A very drinkable beer. This might be my favorite American IPA.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Flyer,2.85,"I have a couple friends who are no doubt tired of hearing me sing the praises of all things Dogfish, so this review may surprise them. This would make a great lawnmower beer, but frankly, my repertoire has no need of a lawnmower beer. Its got a nice golden color and a good head, but not much taste for an IPA. Good, clean, hoppy finish, actually pretty refreshing. In reviewing another beer I said it's the beer Sam Adams wants to be; well, 60 Minute IPA is the beer Budweiser wants to be. So I'll recommend this to my friends who are near-hopelessly stuck in mainstream, but for those who are more savvy, it's pretty dull.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Gmann,3.65,"Pours a light copper golden color with a decent white head that dissipated into a nice cap, not much lacing. The smell is a nice juicyfruit hop aroma. Has a nice fresh buddy hop taste, not as strong as your serious AIPAs, but gets its point across. It has a light feel but is not watery, has a creamy texture to it and finishes very well, overall a good balance. A nice buddy IPA that doesn't crush your tastebuds. It is a little weak compared to some of the other top rated AIPAs but that leads to a very drinkable brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,RunawayJim,4.02,"Poured into a standard pint glass. Started with a white 1 finger head that quickly diminished. The beer is a light amber and not at all cloudy.  Smells very crisp, and very balanced. I can detect some citrusy hops as well as the malts.  Taste is just as balanced as the smell, but not as hoppy as I'd prefer in an IPA. That's not to say this is not a good beer, but it's not quite what I look for in an IPA. It feels a bit thin and watery in the mouth.  All that being said, this is still a very drinkable IPA, probably one of the more drinkable IPA's for people who don't like hops as much, but this seems to be just over the line from APA.  Note: I have had this many times before and never really thought about how balanced and un-hoppy it is. Of course, the last few IPA's I had were very hoppy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,JohnW,3.78,"Appeared pale mahogany, with decent fine dense head, which lasted well down the glass (from the tap.) Aroma is fairly strong with dark malts and hops predominating, hints of roasted grains and pungent. My first pint of this (some months before) I felt the hop bitterness was maybe a bit too much at first, and felt it heavy and not so easy to drink in any quantity, though I enjoyed it all the same.  Having had it again some months later, I really enjoyed it, though still think the hops are well forward, and the texture fairly heavy for an IPA, which makes it less of a session beer to be drunk in any quantity as far as I am concerned. Plenty of taste, strong and characterful, the sort of beer you could have divided opinions about, but improves with familiarity!

It had a strong hoppy aroma - a citrusy, grapefruit-like smell - with a hint of pine needles.  It had a strong hoppy flavor, but not too overbearing. The malt was present throughout, but not too noticeable. Very filling flavor - carbonation kept my mouth alive - and a bit grainy, but still good.  Wow - this is good! The hops weren't too pungent, just a subtle bitterness throughout. I can see why this is DFH's Flagship - it's a good intro to the craft world.

I think any brewer can pull off a mouthful of greenery, but the malt in the back was a kiss on the cheek. This beer is a must pour for any fan of pale ales or IPA's.

Obviously quite hoppy in the aroma. Carries over in the taste, which starts out hoppy and finishes hoppy as well. I must point out though that it's a bit too sweet in some areas.  Still a pretty hoppy brew. Definitely not the best I've had so far but I am positive that it would taste much better straight from a tap. Unfortunately, I do not have that luxury where I live.  It does not justify a low rating though. I like this brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The body of the beer was a nice, dark amber color with a solid, off-white head. The retention did not impress em too muhc; it would reduce to a lacing, but a few swirls of the glass and I was back in business. The smell was fairly interesting; pretty hoppy with malty characteristics. The taste, though, was clearly that of an IPA. The hops were strong, up front, and very noticeable, squashing any thoughts of malts that I had before. The mouthfeel was also excellent; full-bodied and smooth always makes a good beer. For an IPA, this beer was very drinkable. The hops are not so prevalent that you feel like you are going to start having ulcers, but you can taste them a lot all the same. The mouthfeel, along with this great taste, makes this beer pretty solid and good tasting all the way around.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The smell is unique in my experience. Hoppy, as one would expect. The mix of aromas is what I find different about this IPA. There is a strong pine aroma, and a faint citrus, but there almost seems to be a flash of coffee bean in there as well. Smells pretty good though, keeps me coming back.  I know there is malt in there, but pinning down a flavour is pretty tough when the hops are so potent. Citrus is first notable on the front of the tongue, followed by an earthy, almost herbal taste in the middle. That is short-lived though, as the strong pine finish comes in quickly. A true hophead taste.  There is a slight oily feel to the beer, and the carbonation is pretty lively. It is a decent mouthfeel, but for my taste the carbonation could drop a bit.

It took me the first 8 ounces or so to pin down the smell. At first it was a sweet floral, faintly fruit-like smell. By the end of the brew, the fruit aspect seemed to take on a vaguely tropical character.  The judicious use of hops created a tasty IPA that was perfectly in keeping with the style, without being excessive. The taste is above average for an IPA, but it is not quite as complex as I had hoped based on the smell. There was a lot of hop action going on, but it was fairly hard to latch onto anything definite. I think the problem with the continuous hopping during the boil is that the hops characteristics of this beer were never permitted to come out fully in distinct phases; the result is a flavor that is refreshing, but too jumbled to be spectacular.  The mouthfeel is thin, lively, and smooth. It goes down quite nicely.  I could definitely put a few of these away.

S: (3.5) A sweetness followed by hops, the type of hops are not obvious (This doesn't scream C hops). There is also an ""odd"" smell, might be the malt poking though. T: (4.0) There is a graininess that is very apparent, along with a hoppy bitterness. Again, the type of hops are not apparent. Interesting, because I remembered many more aroma hops when I last had this. M: (4.5/5.0) Perfect attenuation and carbonation for the style, assuming this is an APA vs IPA (per the label). D: (4.0) An excellent APA that could use a little more aroma. The fact that it is labeled an IPA seems wrong. This is not a modern IPA, needs more malt and hops for that. Still, I like this beer for the balance between malts and hops (don't often say that about an IPA).

I could only pour half of the bottle and then had to let it settle before continuing. Ended up with a very thick head and lots of lace. The nose smells like hops but only in a general sense, I don't get hints of citrus or pine or other classic hop smells. The taste is obviously an american IPA, but the hops are not overpowering, and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of malts here. There is a strong aftertaste, the hops are almost more apparent once you have swallowed (of course at that point it is just bitterness).

The aroma is pronounced floral hops, nice swee aroma, some malt as well but not a lot. A little sharpness like citrus fruit.  This is a very flavorful IPA and is nicely balanced as well. The hops play a big role but are also not out of line at all, quite oily flavor - citric at first, some sweet flower on the tongue, and an herbal woodiness in the finish. Complex and delightful. Thin in the mouth, some more grains wouldn't kill this brew, finishes a little dry as well. Estery alcohols emerge as it warms.  Outstanding American IPA, I would love to see this one coming to Nebraska.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Appearance: gold, transparent appearance with a nice 3/4"" head off the pour Smell: hops, lots of them; maybe some pine smell too Taste: very good; very hoppy :) ...not very balanced; it seems that there's a dryness in the hops; slight malt flavor hits your tongue also Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied Drinkability: the hops real attack you so two in a row may be a little tough, but you could definitely do two in a night  I've tried DFH beers before and never liked them. However, this one really hits the spot. I'll need to try more again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,MrMcGibblets,3.95,"pours a clear light amber, almost blond color, ok head. citrus, pine, and a some dough in the nose. light/medium bodied, it starts with a medium honeyed malt sweetness up front immediately followed by a nice hop bitterness. a well-balanced ipa. softly carbonated with a drying, medium-long finish. on it's own i would compare this to great lake's burning river pale ale. i am definitely going to finish these off by mixing it half and half with a 90 minute (phenomenal) to make my own almost-sessionable 75 minute ipa.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,semihobo,4.31,"Bottled on 12/29/06, 12 oz. from a sixer.  Clear, amber-yellow. Head is fantastic, this thing could be a beer model. Fills the pint glass to brimming, then settles perfectly and has staying power.  Smells of major citrus, very floral. Also pine resin. Malts are bready. There is a hint of adjunct-y grains as it warms, otherwise excellent.  Taste is syrupy hops. Still floral and citric, very refined and intricate for being this powerful (see Ithaca DIPA as opposed to SN Bigfoot). Minty and piney. Not very bitter. Malts provide fine backing, provides light sweetness on the way out.  Mouthfeel is medium-light, matches the crystal clear appearance. Slightly resinous but that's welcome. Carbonation is moderate to high, tingles as it is rolled around.  Burps out the nose are great. I see why all the hype -- an excellent specimen (and I'm not a hophead). There is a rough edge or two, otherwise this would be the pinnacle of the style. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for... I could drink plenty of these. Outstanding.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Slatetank,4.2,"I ordered this ale at Market Cross Pub in Carlisle  Appearance - A lighter shade of amber w/ a cloud white head  Smell - Piney hop aroma dominates the scent  Taste - Slighty bitter, but subtle floral aroma hops are also present in a pleasing interplay with the clean yeast and malt sweetness that back up the pine hop flavors.  Mouthfeel - Nice effervescent ale with medium body and sweet finish  Drinkability - I find this to be a highly drinkable ale. It is one of the hoppiest flagship ales I have tasted. Balance and drinkability are synonymous in my opinion. This has both a nice bitter quality and is able to be sipped and savored.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Newsman,3.5,"I'll admit, while this is a very good beer, I was expecting to be wowed a bit more given Dogfish's reputation. (This is my first time with one of their brews.) They do seem to be known for experimenting down there in Delaware, and this strikes me as an experimental kind of beer.  Appearance is very good. Crystal clear amber color, light one-finger head, little bit of lacing, but not much. Smells very hoppy, as one might expect from an IPA.  The taste is very intense, VERY hoppy. The malts are well balanced, and it goes down the throat nicely, but the hops are bitter and linger a good long while. I've had a few of these, and the first few tastes are always very strong, almost overpowering. The palate settles in after a while and it becomes less astringent as you drink. Mouthfeel is light but flavorful -- yet the hops linger for, I think, too long.  All told, if you like your IPA's VERY intensely hoppy, then you have an excellent brew. Me, I thought it was just a little too much. I can't really imagine this with food -- it would be too offsetting, I think.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BeerZack,3.92,"Nice foamy head over a clear golden brew. Smells a little earthy, minerally with some sweet flowery perfume (rose?). Caramel maltiness laced with sharp hops. The hops are tamed well by the sweet malt but still linger on the tongue far longer than the sweetness. I also get a little roasted character on the finish. Actually more malt body than the hops want to allow you on the first impression, but you dont feel the heaviness going down... you feel it after the first pint or halfway through the second when your stomach's full. Overall, this is one of the best IPAs available in my area to be sure (just to be fair- Avery, Bridgeport and Lagunitas are the others I consider to be the best 'well-rounded' IPAs in this market [not counting Live Oak Liberation which beats them all but is only available on tap here locally]), but Dogfish is not one of my daily drinkers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,barknee,3.7,"10k gold in color, the DFH 60 is lighter in color than you might expect, but does no fall short on flavor. Evergreen and pine dominate the nose with adequate malting making for an enjoyable brew. This IPA is well bittered and has a nose that exudes good hop character; not as flamboyant as say ""The Finest Kind"" but well tuned and finely delineated. A crisp, lean, and less flabby IPA that ensures real hop laden refreshment to those who need it and deserve it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,andjusticeforale,4.8,"Not typically an IPA drinker; I bought this six pack thinking th e worst. I have enjoyed dogfish head products in the past and thought I would give it a go; I was certainly pleasantly surprised. Perhaps what I like least about IPA's are the unbalanced pine and grapefruit flavors that kill your tongue and beg for a malt backbone.  Well, this is in my opinion, a truly great IPA with consistency, flavor, and perfect balance and backbone; The alcohol is prefectly balanced as well; not too much, not too apparent. It is particularly refreshing, and leaves not sweet or bitter aftertaste. It does not degrade as it warms. Truly a fantastic IPA.  New additional review 3/18/09  it does look great; but really, it smells good too; it has a terrific blend of piney, citrus and grapefruit taste to the hops; it is very present and very bitter but it is very close to absolutely balanced with the malt understructure. The finish is bitterness with a touch of hop sweetness; not malt sweetness, and there is a fatness to the mouthfeel in the finish;  What strikes me as fantastic about this beer is there is a great drinkability and blance that makes it easy to drink more than one, light enough on the alcohol to be refreshing, and it pairs really well with all types of food; chicken wings are a great pairing. Did I say refreshing? the bitterness of the hops makes its super nice; and the flavor of the hops, in my opinion , says that every little nuance is intentional. I have tried countless IPA's, and although some pride themselves on being more bitter or being ""imperially"" heavier in Alcohol, this IPA is effortlessly perfect, no gimmick- its only a noth above its higher ABV 90 minute brother, and only when you want to have more than one or pair it; if you only had one IPA ever to drink, go for the 90 minute sipper, its a trip.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Pours a clear light amber with a moderately-dense off-white head that rose to two fingers and subsided in a couple of minutes.  Drippy lacing is lining the inside of my St. Patty's Day Guinness pint glass from Taco Mac, and thin trails of bubble are slowly rising from the bottom of the glass.  Smells like... an IPA. A little piney, a little citrusy.  Tastes like... an IPA. More piney resin than citrus, and a decent dose of bitterness. Finishes clean, not at all dry, with a rich, if rather pleasant, IPA aftertaste.  Overall, this tastes like an IPA. Nothing spectacular, but it's a darn fine brew.

Tastes of a hop explosion, bitter, piney hops up front, followed by more of the same. Solid mouthfeel, creamy, but not thick. First sip is almost too much carbonation, but within a few minutes it mellows and becomes very well balanced. Very tasty. Not a beer I could sit down and have more than say 2 or 3 of at once, but a definite go to beer for a good flavorful, solid IPA",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Floral hops, bready malts, citrus rind and a bit of lemon and toffee are present on a well balanced nose.  Flavors are reticent on the palate but present tasty pine and floral hops on the entry with a juicy citrus on the mid palate. Everything ties together on a nutty, toffeeish malt and slightly grassy flavored finish that leaves a pleasant light citrus flavor on the palate.  Medium bodied on the palate for an ipa this has a silky mouthfeel with very little off flavors with a pleasant finish. Carbonation is adequate and not copious nor obstrusive. A lingering finish is well done, just a bit dry and well done citrus flavors.  Very quaffable for an ipa, it goes down easy without giving it a second thought.

The smell is just bursting with a hoppy nose and also some malt and spice.  The taste is delightful. Lots of citrus(lemon & grapefruit) but the bitterness is firmly under control due to a solid malt backbone. Nice balance. Dang. The hops are done *so* nicely in this brew making for one hell of a drinkable IPA and the finish has a nice bitter kick that I just don't want to end. I've had this before and I'm so pleased I picked up this bottle on my last trip to Ft Collins.  Bottom line: This is one of my favourite IPAs of all time.

Aroma is laced with barley & rice, sweet hops, and some floral notes. Pleasant, but less hoppy smelling than the 90 minute.  Surprisingly strong alcoholic bite for a 6.0 ABV.

There is a fruity, apple like background flavor that supports the bitterness. There is a little sweetness, but the hops are the star here as compared to the malty sweetness found in the 90 and 120 minutes. Almost has a gumball like taste at the finish just before the last hop bitterness kicks in. The mouthfeel is crisp, beautifully balanced and just the right weight.

The taste explodes in your mouth. I have never had an ale that simply explodes in your mouth. This absolutely does that. Very mild taste of green hops, but also very sharp. The flavor comes to you in a sort of sweet state, then you get smashed with the hops. I bashed the 120 because of true ignorance of the ale. I am ashamed, because quite frankly the 60 is the best pale ale I have ever had. If you want to taste an awesome pale ale then this is the one. I can't state that more. All hale the mighty dog fish.

The smell is light and airy, with strong undertones of citrus. It leaves a solid impression of the flavor yet to come. As promised, the hops are plentiful and are delivered to the palate without reservation. The bold nature of the hops makes for a beer that is a bit single minded in its makeup, but clearly delivers as attended. The citrus undertones carry over into the aftertaste. The beer feels a little high on carbonation as it is going down. Overall, a high quality exhibit of the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The aroma is almost all hop; a blend of citric grapefruit and more earthy pine on a metallic mineral water background. The grapefruit notes are much more prevalent in the flavor. Quite refreshing with a big juicy hop fruitiness. Some pine tones in the finish, but the hop doesn't overwhelm and the beer remains sweet to the end. Despite the lack of head, the beer is decently carbonated, light, and really quenching.

The flavor is quite sweet, not as sweet as the 90 minute but not nearly as sweet as stone IPA. There is defiantly a good floral hit from the hops, but damn, this beer seems different. The body is a lot heavier then stone, which I had a few hours ago and what I using to compare this to. It isnt bad, but it isnt the best of the style I have had.  Mouthfeel: Thick, a bit syrupy which isnt what I was looking for.  Drinkability: I have to try this beer some other time when I am feeling a bit better and I havent eaten in a few hours.

Continuous stream of carbonation bubbles off bottom of glass and lacing clings to its' sides.  Smell: floral piney hops and citrus, maybe rinds of grapefruit.

Had the 90 Min. last night and this is not far behind. I prefer the roasted smell of this just a tad over Stone's rendition.

Probably my limit when it comes down to hoppy beers, I can still understand & enjoy something so unassuming & potent to the average imbiber.  Very piny & prickly on my nose, I always eat something with this, or my tongue withers inward after a few sips. A sweet, almost woody character. Almost maple, but not. The hard carbonation practically swallows for me. Once it dies down, you forget about the last gulp & try it again; it's almost addicting.  One of the few IPAs I've had that can stand up & defend itself without the help of it's hoppy profile. Not too sessionable, unless the right occasion arises, at least for me it isn't.

Produces a heavy looking two finger head which, over some time, dies down and leaves a nice melted-butter type lace on the sides of the glass. Beautifully fresh aroma of pine and citrus. This beer smells great. Not as strong a bouquet as the 90-Minute, but very pleasant. Tastes great too. Strong notes of pine again with grapefruit and an earthy bitter finish. Possesses a strong lingering aftertaste of piney hoppiness. Lip-smacking good. The mouthfeel holds up well. This could easily be a session beer.

Something about it has a bit of a bite, but I can't place it.  Mouthfeel/drinkability: Beer goes down smooth and light. It does feel somewhat thin and insubstantial.

So yum -- I guess -- so long as you really dig grapefruity hops.  Maybe this is a personal thing, but I tend to lose patience with this sort of beer. I sometimes think that this is rather like what has happened with ""cajun"" food. You just dump a whole bunch of pepper into a dish and that makes it ""cajun"" -- right? How much brewing skill does it take to dump a bunch of hops into a batch of beer?  Don't get me wrong -- it's not really bad beer. But it is nothing special either, and it was pricey.

Taste is substantially stronger than the smell had me thinking. Esters, grapefruit, pine; really makes your mouth water. Slight maltiness. Alcohol not really noticable except in the feel. Bitter finish (excellent!) Lots of flavor.  Mouthfeel is top-notch. Thick but not heavy, perfect amount of carbonation. Dry finish. Really good.  Overall a superb IPA.

10099,6108,ncvbc,4.47,"One of my favorite IPA's. Pours a brilliant golden orange with a nice, fluffy head. Excellent smell of fresh hops that basically dominates completely. This is one of those IPA's that I just can't get enough of. I try to keep a few of these at all times when I need a hop fix. Crisp hops stunted slightly by malts and the hops come back once again. So damn fresh. Nice, smooth mouthfeel with a light to medium body. One of the more drinkable IPA's that I've had and a definite classic in my book.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,bradleyseven,4.42,"poured in a mixing glass (american pint glass)  Visual: clear, straw colored liquid with 1/2 inch of bubbly white head that goes away very easily leaving only the slightest bit of lacing  Smell: slightly sweet smelling notes of lemon and orange  Taste: easy malt taste - mild breadiness. Hops are King here though, strong citrus: lemon, lime, and orange pith. faint herbal notes on the finish as well  Body: medium bodied, slightly chewy hops linger on the tongue and inner cheeks  Drinkability: this is a very versatile beer. it is great as a session beer (when i am feeling a little frisky for hops); it is a beer that i often suggest when someone tells me that they want to know what ""hops"" are all about...it is very hop-forward, but not overwhelming; it is also a great starter if you are planning an evening of bigger and hoppier things",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,LvilleIPA,3.96,"A - A clear golden color with a thick rocky head on top.  S - Very mild. Nothing really sticks out too much, maybe just your average citrus and malts.  T - Excellent taste. Great hop flavor without being too overboard. This is alot more balanced than I expected it to be.  M - Medium bodied, actually a very ""juicy"" taste. It's like a citrus burst once in you mouth. It's decieving because (maybe my nose is clogged) I don't smell much. Leaves the mouth semi-dry, which is nice.  D - One of the best ""everyday"" IPAs I've had. It's not an assault on your mouth, it's just very, very good. It's got a great balance to it, and you could definitely drink quite a few of these. It's even better on tap if you can find it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,beeragent,3.69,"Part of a series of beers that my brother-in-law had stored in a refrigerator, but gave up due to them moving. This particular beer is at least three years old. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a hazy orange, forming a thick 1 inch head, leaving light lacing along the glass. Very faint aroma, mostly of hops, and a little citrus. The taste is mostly hops, creating a very nice but mild citrus flavor. Not as intense as 90 minute IPA, but still tasty. The mouthfeel is medium, just right for an IPA. Overall, this is a very enjoyable, and easy to drink IPA. Not too much bite, but enough to know that your drinking a quality IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TheDeuce,3.57,"With all the hype surrounding this beer, I expected a little bit more, maybe it was just my six pack.  Appearance-normal dark gold haze color, little head which is fizzy comes briefly up then settles.  Smell-Hoppy aroma that is one dimensional, does hide the alcohol well but also other traces of malt and other ingrediants.  Taste-pure hop oil through and through, the hop character is generous, all other flavors sorted out, seems like one brand of hops was used and used generously, alcohol is well hidden but only due to hop aroma.  Mouthfeel-hoppyness through and through, not bad but again one dimensional, dry and heavy in the mouth, going down rashly ending with a bitter finish.  Drinkability-decent finish, hoppy in the endnotes, dry finish, not too much alcohol.  Overall- since I am a hop fan, I have heard Dogfish Head's name spoken with near reverence, while this is a perfectly fine beer there isn't much that leaps out at me, it is hoppy but one-dimensional, rash instead of smooth, and overly active on the way down. Nothing bad to say about it and I will certainly try it again but this time I am a little underwhelmed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Citrus overtones with a bit of that nice pine scent. Not very strong, but pleasant nonetheless.  Excellent grapefruit up front with good spice and surprising dryness on the finish  Not over-carbonated with just a little creaminess to the texture. Totally drinkable and a definite keeper over the course of an evening. A no-frills take on the IPA from DFH executed deftly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Feels very frothy and dry.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,carlosd74,3.96,"Let me start off by saying I typically do not like this brewer. Its not that they don't make great beers, they are just not my cup o' tea. I revisited this since I was looking for a new IPA to drink. I remember gagging on the 120 Minute of theirs but I just couldn't remember if I ever had the entry level IPA. 120 was just to over the top with hp-lovin'.  Well I am glad I picked up this one. The bottle said it was released on 10/16/06 so I knew it was fresh.  It poured a surprising golden color. I thought I may have gotten the wrong beer. I am so use to IPAs like Hedonism , Stone, and Hop Devil that this caught me off guard. It had a nice head...nothing crazy like you may get with Route 113 but it was visually appealing. this quickly dispated and there was minimal lacing.  There wasn't really a strong smell to describe. Maybe my nose was stopped up but it did not jump out at me. In fact it might as well have been Stella Artios.  The taste was balanced. The hop levels were more like a Pale Ale or even Pils. I can't place the hops..not citrusey like a Cascade. I am guessing they are English or German hops.  Very easy drinking but nothing exciting. It would be a good one for newbies to craft brewed IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,IgnatiusReilly,4.38,"Poured 12oz. bottle to pint glass at home.  A: Pours a clear golden orange. Good sized head. Lace stays on the glass for the duration.  S: Was expecting a little more hop burst from the smell. Still the citrus of the hops work their way out, as well as the buttery diacetyl and bready aroma from the yeast.  T: Near perfect for an IPA. Full piney hop flavor that slightly outweighs the malt balance. Still the malt comes through with both nutty and grain flavorings. Long bitter hop after taste remains, with a little bit of alcohol.  M: Smooth and crisp.  D: So easy to drink. A bold beer that could still be enjoyed one after another.  Simply outstanding. A staple in my fridge from here on out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Mebuzzard,4.28,"Pours a hazy, off orange-amber body. The head pours thick to about 2 fingers, hangs on valiantly and dies to about 1/2 finger. Smell of citrus/biscuit. A bit of alcohol comes through as well. Taste: Mostly yeasty hops and citrus. Some fizz livens up the malt for a bit of sweetness. Still, the oily feel and the floral hops dominate. A different IPA in that the flavor is richer and more complex than simply a ton of hops. Very drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,sulldaddy,4.17,I'm reviewing this beer as the first keg I bought for my new kegerator system.  the beer is chilled and poured into a pint glass. The an orange gold color with 1 inch creamy eggshell white head foaming up. Small streams of carbonation rise to the surface.. The aroma is lots of hops with primarily herbal and resiny notes mixing. The first sip reveals an average body and very fine tingly carbonation. Flavor is as expected with mild caramel notes briefly up front that give way to the resiny hops fairly quickly. The hops linger long after I swallow. the beer is smooth and clean and makes for an easy drinker. I am able to have several pints in a setting and not get bored. QUite nice brew all around.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell: A very crisp hopy smell to it with a malted and fruity smell.  Taste: A very fresh hop taste with a citric herbal tone. The maltiness holds up great with the hops and it also has a slightly fruity taste.  Mouth-Feel: A very refreshing brew with a crisp almost dry finish with a lingering hopy feel.

Intense floral and piney aroma of hops, great-smelling IPA. The hops are agressive, floral, citrusy and bitter from start to finish, with just the right balance of malt in between. Pretty classic example of the style, completely successful. Great with the hearty well-made pub fare. 6% ABV is as close to a ""session beer"" as you can find at DFH...luckily you can walk back to most of the motels in town from the brewpub...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,jvonkluck,4.22,"S- The nose on this one is nearly all citrus - dominantly grapefruit aroma mixed with a pleasant amount of almost honey-like sweetness from the malt.  A- Pours a nice copper with a solid white head that laces nicely and retains most of the way through the glass.  T- When it first hits your tongue, the flavor is dominantly citrusy and holds some of the accompanying bitterness from the hops. As the taste progresses, it takes on more flavor from the malt and finishes out with a very slightly toasted note before fading back to a nice residual hop bitterness on the palate.  M- As is fitting for an IPA, it rolls around just slightly heavy in the mouth.  D- The copious quantity of hops involved in this beer makes it ever so slightly too bitter to really just drink one after another after another.

The taste is of a citrusy hops held together by a background of sweet, bready malt. A bitter, almost sharp, twang in the finish. Well-balanced for the style Citrus in the finish reminds you that it is an IPA.  It has a medium, well-textured body.  A ""sessionable"" IPA.

The beer was bright orange.  Smell is no doubt hoppy with a good malt base, some huskiness and a wort -or mash-like smell. Also some sweetness.  Taste is bitter and hoppy, not as bitter hoppy as I expected, but still very good. The hops bring a citric, lemon, grapefruit, american taste. There is a good balance between the hops and the malt taste. The beer is somewhat sticky, but not sweet. Body is medium and well balanced with a good drinkability.

Smell is spicy from the hops I gather. First taste is a high red grapefruit zest but not overwhelming. When it hits the tip of the tongue and back of throat it has a bite to it and this beer keeps you smacking your lips for more. I can't gather what I taste other than a spicy peppery taste.

Flavor: With just a little net bitterness, a solid malt backbone balances a healthy dose of noticeable hop flavor. Has a crisp, hop-induced finish.  Mouthfeel: Lightly coats with a dose of sugary malt. Palate cleanses quickly on the finish.  Drinkability: This is a fantastic beer, easily quaffed.

I tried this beer a few months back, and have previously sampled the 90 and 120 Minute as well, but have never reviewed any of them.  The beer pours out amber and sparkling (unlike a lot of craft brewed IPAs which are hazy). It has a large amount of head and excellent head retention (down to the last swallow).  Aroma is surprisingly not so much of hops as it is of a darker malt...smells more like a porter than an IPA.  Taste is pretty big bitterness up front with a suprising amount of maltiness (for an IPA). The taste is slightly sweet.  For what its worth, mouthfeel is about perfect for an IPA. The beer is slightly sticky which keeps the flavor in your mouth. Carbonation is also just right...carbonated enough to be refreshing yet not enough to disrupt the transfer of sensation of hop bitterness through my tongue to my grateful brain.

What followed was an extremely involved interlacing of flavours and textures. This beer demands that your palette spends some time with it and yet is not a poncy beer. This is a rubki's cube of flavour. Not a beer for the masses but not a superficial hollow trend chasing brew either. I can't fairly give a fair review of this one based on one bottle. I guess that is a review in and of itself.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,MrHurmateeowish,4.17,"Yellow translucent body with thin offwhite head. Smells rather malty, caramel malty. Flavor is equally malty and hoppy. Caramelized malt initially, and hops sets in toward the finish. Medium bodied. Extremely tasty, and very well-balanced. Probably the best IPA I've ever had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,mobud,4.2,"Serve: Poured from a bottle. Brewed in August 2006. Sampled in a shaker glass.  Appearance: Nice pour with a nice clear copper color. Head poured to about 1cm and had some lacing as beer was sampled. carbonation remained during sample.  Smell: The whole bend of this beer is hops and this thing delivers. The floral scent grabs you and pulls you in. I know this beer is over hopped, but in these days of 120 Minute (and 90), this falls right in the middle of the hops war.  Taste: Almost no malt and a feeling that you are drinking hops resin straight.  Mouthfeel: Again the Hops get the big push here. The resin feel in your mouth almost burns, but not enough to make you stop. The aftertaste is ok, with some bitterness and alittle malt sweetness to balance the hops.  Drinkability: One of my favorite session type beers. Not overpowering for those who are not hop-inclined, but still will make those who are happy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Honestly, I was a little disappointed.  A-Looked good enough. Clear copper, 1/2 inch head okay retention, very good lace from what remained.  T-Citrus hop, metallic taste, and some malt. The metalic taste was a bit offputting so it was hard to discern the qualities of the appropriate tastes.  M-this was not bad, trying to get past the metalic taste, there is a nice light body with nice carboantion.  D-No more please, there must be something wrong with this one.

T - Extremely well-balanced hoppiness and maltiness. Extremely clean. Hint of sweetness to offset the somewhat intense bitterness.  M - Medium bodied, with perfect carbonation.

10099,6108,Damian,4.02,"Drank on-tap at Penguin Pizza, Boston, MA  Poured a clear, pale, golden yellow with a fizzy, one finger head. Many patches of dripping lacing.  Smell was intense. Lots of zesty, piney hops with strong citrus and fruitiness as well (apples were quite apparent).  Taste was similar to smell. Pleasantly hoppy from start to finish. Cascade hops created a nice crisp bitterness, but were not overwhelming. Some citrus, ripe fruits and a bit of candied sugar were noticeable as well. These elements, combined with a gracious amount of malts, resulted in a very nicely balanced and flavorful IPA. Resiny, slightly bitter, lingering finish was almost sticky.  The only aspect of this beer that was disappointing was the mouthfeel. It was quite thin and fizzy.  Drinkability was very good, as this beer went down quite easily and would be a perfect match with a variety of foods. Furthermore, the alcohol was hardly noticeable in the taste but definitely managed to catch up with me by the beer's end.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,yelterdow,4.24,"Fresh from a three week old batch, bottled on 10/17/06. Served in a pint glass at just over fridge temperature.  Appearance- Pours a medium to pale gold with a solid three finger head... scores of tiny bubbles launch their tiny selves through the crystal clear liquid and into the already thick, pillowy crown.  Smell- Big, beautiful, juicy hop oils are oozing from this beer... I wasn't prepared for the succulence in this aroma at all. Having been a 90-minute fan for years, this resiny, bold character is a welcome treat. The fresh, alive sweetness is taking on a malty profile as it opens up... now displaying even some biscuity notes. I swear I think I just smelled weed... the really good, wet kind...  Taste- Nice... the balance here is amazing. A cookie-like bready character envelops this hop-filled showcase, finishing with a terrific flogging of juicy bitterness that leaves resin stuck to the sides of the tongue and cheeks. So much flavor in a quick moment in time.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Instant and reactive... the sizzling yet wonderfully restrained carbonation is just right for the bold, balls the the wall hop profile. This one really leaves its mark, even minutes after the swallow... this quells tonight's hop fix with finesse.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,John1985,4.28,"Beautiful copper color with giant white cloud head. Sweet malty aroma that was spiced with hops. Flavor was rich, earthy malt with hops coming in at the middle and finished with a pleasant bitterness. Very balanced flavor without being too heavy. An excellent ale, I'm not sure it's a IPA but it is very tasty nonetheless. Drinkability is second to none.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,AustinBeerLvr,4.47,"Had this on tap tonight at Opal Divines here in Austin. Poured into a traditional pint glass.  A: Nothing real special, but still a very solid amber, reddish appearence.  S: Big time citrius hops! Hops, hops, and more hops are what I got from the smell of this brew. However, there was a slight presence of a little sweetness to round this out.  T: Oh man, what a beer! This is the IPA I thought could never exist. What's so special about the taste of this IPA is that while it has the very strong hop flavor you would expect for the style, it has just hint of a malt sweetness to round everything out in the end. It's subtle, but it makes all the difference in the world. Like I said, strong hops, a perfect blend between citruisy flavors and bitterness.  M: Very good for the style and to accomadate the flavor. Certainly by no means watery. Also, not too heavy.  D: What else can I say that's good about this brew? I honestly can't think of anything not good to say about it. Honestly, I'm normally not a strong IPA drinker (yeah, go ahead, send me an e-mail telling me I'm a whimp), but this one was just awesome. They say in life ""it's the little things that make you happy"".

10099,6108,IntriqKen,3.06,Light golden yellow with a half finger white head that melts to sticky lacing. Aroma is disappointingly lager-like...I don't notice much in the world of hops at all....a little biscuit yeast and lager type hops is all. Taste is sort of boring to me.

Head clears out, but clings in rigs to the glass. Smells sweet and tar, nice citrusy hops.  Surprisingly mellow hop presence (by IPA standards.) It's a touch grapefruity. Malty sweetness. Closes out with a peppery bitterness. Simple, smooth, medium mouthfeel. Little carbonation, and little sign of alcohol.  Very nice. Does not fit in with hop-crazed IPAs, standing out in a good way. Easy to see where the artfully balanced 90 Minute IPA comes from. Good stuff to keep on hand.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,DaveFL1976,4.2,"I prefer this to the 90 minute. I'm a hop head, no doubt, but I find that the 90 has a bit of abrasiveness to it that doesn't sit well on my palate. The 60, though. Yummers. Lovely golden body capped with a thick and foamy head. The smell, as others have mentioned, is a combonation of sweet malty goodness and piney hops. The taste is nicely balanced. Both malt and hops play important roles here, but the hops bite you back at the end of the swallow. ""Don't forget about us,"" they say. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but perhaps a little overcarbonated. That could be the fault of the bar, though. Quite a drinkable IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,SchaefMan,4,"Well, at first, I was not too impressed. I got a 6-pack of this for 10 bucks, and split it with a friend. The appearance was good. A nice clear, sort of dark amber, with a decent head. There was a hoppy aftertaste, which I did not dig at first, but the flavor was good. It was a little better when I just drank it down, than when I tried to taste it, if you know what I mean. The last couple of the 6 were better, but for 10 bucks, I have too many beers to try to go back and get more of this one right away.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,bluejacket74,4.03,"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a gold/orange color with a large white head. It smells like grassy and pine hops. The taste is mainly sweet malt and floral hops, with a hoppy bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium and slick, however I think it's a bit too carbonated for me. With that being said, the drinkability is good as this beer is smooth and goes down easy. It seems more like a regular pale ale than an IPA. It's still good, however I like the 90 Minute IPA better.

One of the finest plain drinking beers I've had, but lacking in the depth or chewiness that I look for in an IPA, reminds me of Anchor Liberty.

The head was clean white and stuck around for a while, eventually leaving only thin white lace and coating the glass a little bit.  The smell was pleasant but not remarkable. Some esters are all I really picked up.  The taste was great. Very sharp and refreshing. There was plenty of malt and floral, fruity flavors on the front end, and a good bit of bitters off the back, but not over the top by any means. I noticed though that it had a strange almost soapy taste, regardless, it was a great brew.  This beer was nice and thin, but smooth. I don't mean thin in a bad way at all. It was easy to put away, not the kind of beer that you have one of and then have to recuperate after.  Very drinkable.

The head is massive, although that might just be the way I poured it. Nice amount of carbonation.  Beautiful, dry and hoppy scent. Not bitter or overwhelming, but boy can you tell it's there.  The taste is pure hops with a slight bit of that metallic, alcoholic flavor. The slight bitterness in the hops are exactly what I would expect from the folks at DFH.  One of the smoothest beers in the arsenal. It is thick, but goes down the gullet like gangbusters. If you like hops, but don't like the bitter aftertaste, this is one you can order with confidence. Very very drinkable. The DFH guys really know how to do hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,joe1510,3.88,12oz. Bottle  Poured a perfectly clear straw gold with a 1 finger eggshell white head. It diminished slightly to a half finger and got nice and creamy. Looks more like a pilsner than an IPA. A ton of carbonation coming up from all over the glass. The head stuck on here throughout. Stayed nice and creamy.  Smells very grassy. This grassy/earthiness is followed by a small touch of citric hops towards the end. The strong grass is slightly off putting but as it warms it mellows and there's more citrus coming forward. As it warms more I can smell the caramel maltines coming through as well.  Taste is good. Different than what I thought it'd be from the smell. There's a good hop bite up front followed by a piney bitterness that makes its appearence during the swallow. A very solid malt backbone lasts throughout the drink to balance everything nicely. Every now and then I can pick up some alcohol in my nose and throat.  The mouthfeel is good. Medium bodied. Coats the mouth with every sip.  Drinkability is up there. It's easy drinking. Good mouthfeel and balanced.  Overall 60 Minute is a good beer from Dogfish head. I'll buy more of theses in the future. I've had better but this is a good example. Give it a try.

10099,6108,BeerSox,4.22,"12 oz bottle into mug  Clear light amber hue. Solid egg-shell white head with good retention. Settles to a strong cap. Plentiful laing.  Strong floral and piney hop aroma. Bread like malts sit in the background.  Grainy malty flavors start then the beer quickly shifts to spicy hops. Flavors have a citric like quaity to them. The hop bitterness lingers in the back of the mouth after each sip. Hints of diacetyl can be detected when the beer gets closer to room temperature. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Dry finish from the hops.  Obviously not as strong at the 90 Minute, but still a good amount of punch from the hops. This is probably more of an every day style beer compared to the 90 Minute. Recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BlackJeremiah,3.65,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: Deep, clear golden. Some undeveloped head, some streaming. Rather bland and unassuming.  S: Roasty smells (?!), pine tar and pine resin, grass, citrus.  T: Really roasted character up front, which I think is pretty strange for a beer of this style (and color). Orange and pine hop flavors assert themselves, but are not particularly overwhelming. A confusing taste for an IPA, and completely unlike I expected.  M: Almost a porter-ish feel on the palate, but maybe it's the roasty flavors tricking me.  D: This tastes nothing, nothing like the 90 Minute. It also tastes nothing like an IPA, eschewing hop character for roasted malt flavors. It's strange, and although I liked it, I can't really give it high marks due to its bizarre derivations from its stated style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,geexploitation,4.57,"Pours a burnished golden amber with a tiny but sticky head. Very clear body -- this bottle is of the newer, unfiltered version of this ale. Great nose to this beer. Big, vibrant hops that contain citric acid and resin elements backed with some mint and caramel malts. On the palate, brash bitterness up front, with sweet malts coming through at the mid palate. The finish is very long, as chunky, dirty hops flavors sizzle on the tongue for a good thirty to sixty seconds between sips. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with sharp hop bitterness that braces the tongue. Not for the faint hearted. All in all, this is an utterly excellent IPA, close to perfect for the style. To my mind, the Dogfish Head 60 Minute outpaces the 90 Minute in its enjoyability, sessionability, and strength relative to style. Awesome.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Pegasus,4.3,"Appearance: Muddy golden brown, with a massive, persistent off-white, cloudtop head, profuse lacing, and abundant carbonation.  Aroma: Strong aroma of pine tar, citrus, and grassy hops and toasted and bread malts. And as well, faint, but definitely present, a subtle note of vanilla.  Taste: Opens with sweet malt, followed by a complex wave of hop notes, with citrus and pine most prominent, but also others more subdued, one being particularly like mint. These largely overshadow the malt, which still manages to asset itself to a degree, with mild caramel and honey notes, particularly late in the taste. The finish is mildly bitter, which a mild herbal and medicinal note.  Mouth feel: Smooth and soft, quite full, very pleasant.  Drinkability/notes: A wonderfully well-balanced example of the style, which is usually typified by over-the-top bitterness. The use of hops is excellent, allowing the complexity of the different hop varieties to show.  Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,mmcave,4.45,"Poured into tumbler, decent head, dissipates at medium speed and lingers on top. The foam left thin, but happy lacing. The color is a nice, orangey coppery amber. Smells almost buttery for some reason, this is most likely just my freak palate at the moment. There is some nice toffee, medium aromatic hops, a tinge of hay, fruit and some alcohol. Taste is crisp and clean, not dry like an English IPA. The bitter hops hit perfectly, and dissipate with out killing you (not that killing you with hops is ever bad), I get some sweetness, with toffee or chocolate at times, all is extremely well balance though. This for a long time has been one of my favorite staple IPAs simply because it wont kick you're ass with high ABV or its crazy hops, but you can drink so many and feel happy. This is not an IPA that will thrill you, but it will definitely please you.

Looks like a pilsner with how light and clear it is.  Nice floral and citrus hop aroma, on the lighter side actually, for an IPA. Maybe a little tiny bit of caramel malt coming through.  Very smooth taste. One of the more subdued IPAs. Spicy hops on the tip of the tongue, then a little touch of malt sweetness in the middle before a dry finish. Nice balance.  Lighter bodied for an IPA, spicy on the palate. Again, very much like a pilsner.  Highly drinkable because the hops aren't as overbearing as in some (especially after a couple). This doesn't destroy your taste buds. Seems like a perfect session beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

It results in an unbelievably balanced clean finish with min to no aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light to med with proper coverage and body. D: Extremely drinkable but with 6% ABV prolonged sessions could be very pleasing/dangerous. I sampled a cask IPA @ Boscos brewpub in Nashville recently that is almost identical to 60 min.

Taste: A very sweet (mild for DFH though) malted barley flavor with a mellow hop ending.* The light, golden crispy malt really holds it all down The hops are amazingly complex, old school but seriously New England style.

The hops are the star of the show, however, bitter, but the grapefruit citrus flavors are delicious and give a real fresh flavor to the beer. A very easy to drink and well crafted IPA.

Taste: Oranges and pine needles up front, with a delicate malt background. This one seems hoppier than i remember. A mellow bitter aftertaste lays on the tongue and stays there.

Pours a light golden with a short-lasting head...smells grassy and hoppy with some lemon lingering in the background. I was expecting a similar taste to the 90 minute IPA, and it resembles that...but not as well-balanced. There's a hoppy kick, but it borders being a little too bitter for my taste. The 90 minute is by far supreme, but this is a nice choice if none is available.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,cash22,3.33,"60 Minute IPA - 'The continually-hopped India Pale Ale.'  Serving Type - 12oz Bottle no freshness date Apperance - nice amber with a small head Smell - like hops! Mouthfell - good, strong hop flavors true to the style  The 90 minutes seems more balanced with malt sweetness when compared to the 60. In my opinion the 60 has much more of a bitter bite to it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TurdFurgison,4.34,"DFH 90min is one of my all-time favorites, so I tried this ""little brother"" expecting to slam it somehow (something like ""I know 90min, I'm friends with 90min, and you sir are no 90min"").  But actually 60min has a lot going for it. Appearance is it's weakest attribute, due to clear and pissy yellow color (although the head was poofy which is nice). The smell and taste are really good, more malty than you see from most IPA's. Nice and thick mouthfeel, this came through as a strongly above average and well balanced IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,addmorehops,4.14,I have actually had this at the restaurant in Rehoboth and I'm sorry to say it has taken me 4 years to buy a six pack.  Broad flavors typical of AIPA with exceptional hop pallet and a unique but subtle smoky/oaky edge. Conservative hop blast compared to their 90. A must for hopheads looking for a good session beer or a good match for spicy food.  Cheers!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TechMyst,4.95,"Excellent Beer. No conditioning sting. Yellow with orange tinge (reflected color.) Foaming head quickly dissapating. Somewhat pine aroma. Dry smoked oak flavor. Wonderfully hopped, beautifully bitter! This is how beer SHOULD taste! I cannot wait to get my hands on the other higly hopped IPAs...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,SilentSabre,3.67,"I must say, this was better than average, but just. Pour was a crystal clear medium golden straw with a white fluffy head that faded away in about 40 seconds. Several streams of CO2 bubbles steadily rise to fuel the patchy lace work that floats on the liquid's surface. Nice looking lacing sticks to the edges of the glass when tilted. Looks nice, but nothing super special IMO. Pine resin and citrusy grapefruit, while present, are more subtle than I was expecting. Smell is quite tame, indeed. The taste, like the smell, has your typical Cascade / Centennial hopped IPA characteristics, but again, isn't as assertive as I was expecting. Mouthfeel is fairly ""par for the course"" with a medium body and moderate carbonation. This is a good IPA. Not great or fantastic, simply good. I would, however, buy this again.  *I must give thanks to my mother for bringing this back from Florida for me, as DFH is not distributed in Ga. as of my writing this review. Thanks, mom!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,plaid75,4.03,Poured a medium copper hue with a one finger white foamy head. There was good retention and excellent sticky lacing.  The smell was very well balanced. A strong peppery and citrus hop aroma was offset nicely by a sweet smelling biscuity malt.  The taste was a nice combination of peppery hop resin and butter cookies. A nice satisfying flavor. Mild huskiness.  The mouthfeel was full with a dry finish.  Overall a very drinkable AIPA. Very sessionable.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,cwachtel,4.43,Pours a very nice light golden color...I expected a little deeper hue but thats not a negative. Thin head that disappears quickly but nicely laces the glass. I didn't find much in the way of hop aroma...I would have liked a little more. But that is more than made up for in the taste! Great hop flavor without overpowering the beer. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel and carbonation levels were perfect to me. Finishes well without leaving too much of a hoppy aftertaste.  I have found my new favorite IPA!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,daliandragon,3.95,"Well balanced nose, with sweet chocolate malt flavorings to match the brisk hops. Body is a transparant light amber with a fluffy, fast-fading head and moderate lacing.  Big hops right out front in the flavor but its more gentle, round, bitterness than the face puckering blast of the 90 minuute. Welll crafted, reminds me a bit of Brooklyn's IPA. Also, better balanced than most IPAs, with nutty malt runnning step for step with the hops.  Overall, a solid, sessionable IPA although I'm still looking for a trademark product from Dogfish Head to go gaga over but haven't found it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,jasonjlewis,4.57,"Like the 90 minute ipa but less bitter. I like the 90 minute better.  I had this beer after trying chimay and having a cherry wheat, because I wanted a hop fix, but not an overboard wone.  Appearance: Great, nice, large head, with good retention  Smell: citrusy, lemony, pleasant  Taste: Nice and bitter. I love the hop profile. A nice bite, but I don't find it overberaing. A lot of balance to the beer.  Mouthfeel+ drinkability: Very crisp. I could drink this beer all night. VERY VERY sessionable. Won't destroy the palate for changes to lighter styles.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,diamondc,3.32,My favorite beer style is definetly IPA and I found the 60 Minute IPA a tad overrated. The pour had a lot of head and the lacing was VERY sticky after the head coming down to one finger thickness. I'm not sure this is a good thing. After warming up I tasted more syrup'y citrus than the hops that I really like. I couldn't taste much malt or caramel like the other reviews. The 'born on date' was in April so I guess this was in the light too much or something. Maybe I need to try a bottle of the 90 to get the real deal IPA from Dogfish.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,quasimoto,3.48,"A - Light copper/ orange with nice bith frothy head that is lacing like a beast.  S - Piney citrus hops dominate this one Some floral, but not overpowering. Some dry crackery malts are in there with what appears to be some paper bag... Its still good though.  T - almost a biscuity malt is in there. But it is well balanced by the hops. There is lies the problem with me. I loathe amarillo hops. They are muddy and dry, and unpleasant.  M - Smooth mouthfeel. Nice and slick, slightly dries out on the end but not much.  D - Sam and Bryan....they are masters in my book of drinkable beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Deconstructionis,3,"I'm one who just doesn't get the fuss over this brewery. None of its beers which I've tasted much impress me but this is the most drinkable. I suspect that overpricing your products leads some to assume they must therefore be exceptional.  This pours a cloudy orange with a very sudsy pale tangerine head. The aroma is hoppy, sour citrus and the overwhelming pine that is omnipresent in the Dogfish IPAs. It's a medium/light bodied brew with high carbonation. Unlike the 90, and of course the 120, there is no unpleasant raw alcohol burn to drown out all flavor but the suspicion that the alcohol in the those is drowning out a tasty well balanced base proves false. the pine taste just dominates more in the absence of the alcohol, although with this one you can actually taste the malt.  All in all, it's not a bad ale but the only spectacular thing is the price",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,uconnalum2,3.97,Pours an orange-brown color with a small head. Lots of hops smell. The taste is crisp and hoppy with some bitterness in the aftertaste. Nice smooth mouthfeel.

10099,6108,BlindPig,3.72,I feel like this brew is lacking for an IPA. It pours a light orange/copper color. Thin off white head. Smells citrusy hops. Maybe some grapefruit and orange? Taste is kind of weak. It's not as full on as I was expecting and will keep on expecting out of a IPA. Not to bitter. Has a lighter citrus hop flavor. The aftertaste is a light bitter but not near strong. I feel like this could be a Pale Ale. Its right on the edge between a IPA and a PA. Overall good brew but is lacking for me. It does go down very easy though.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,rustymoore,4.1,Pours a golden amber with a nice thick head and good lacing. Almost as tasty as it's big brother the 90 min but it just doesn't quite do as well for a couple of reasons. First is the lower alcohol content...everyone wants more bang for their buck right? Second is the decrease in hop flavor...this one is just a little more watered down but overall I could drink this one more regularly because a more affordable price.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Gaisgeil,4.07,"This i just a good, well made IPA, well suited to everyday drinking. Not over the top, but not middle of the road either. Pours a bright and clear gold in color with a loose white head with good retention. Nose is very nice, very hoppy and fresh some malt detectable. Taste is well balanced, but definitely hoppy and interesting; bold. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy, but light and refreshing. Drinkability is quite high, a good session candidate.

Aroma is a variety of hops including some piney and citrusy scents. There is also a bit of caramel maltiness luring around.  The flavor is very savory and mimics the smell. A well balanced blend of hops with an underlying caramel maltiness that are in harmony. Very well rounded.  Medium body, creamy texture.  This is a delicious beer and a great example of what this style can be.

10099,6108,gmfessen,4.2,"Poured into a pint glass, beer has a nice head with lacing that loves to hang around. In appearance - clear golden colored brew, beautiful. It has a citrusy hop smell, with a taste to follow that actually has more of a malty taste than I would normally expect in an IPA. Medium body, with a creamy head.

10099,6108,cjgator3,4.53,"Pours an orangey amber color with sticky white head that stuck all over the glass for the entire duration of the drink. Aroma is sweet malt and floral hops. Taste is delicious! Taste starts out sweet giving way to a nice bite from the hops. The sweet almost doughey malt does stand up well next to the hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy that just makes the mouth drool. Overall, this is an excellent brew. DFH did a superb job on this one!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,edbeered,4.3,"This pours a very pale straw color, with a 1/4 inch white head that fades quickly, leaving a small amount of lace on the glass.The smell is of piney hops.

I would love to taste this on tap sometime. Nice one!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,hunteraw,4.1,"Appearance: Pretty light in color, more gold than amber or orange. Moderate head, which leaves nice lace. Fairly clear.  Smell: Fresh hops aroma, of course. Pine and citrus. Some sweetness in the background.  Taste: Bready, bitter - a little sweeter than I remember it being the first time I had it. Hop notes are citrus, spice and grass.  Mouthfeel: A little thicker in the mouthfeel than I'd expected. Carbonation is perfect.  Drinkability: Very drinkable, sessionable, but expensive.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,phishgator,4.6,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Big head that was foamy and airy. The color is lighter than I remember on tap. It is deep golden with nice carbonation. The aroma is floral, citrusy, and faintly honey sweet. The taste is much the same, but the hops jump in the front, middle, and end. This will dull your taste buds after 1 or 2. As a hophead this is what you look for in an IPA! The hop bitterness is almost overpowering. The mouth is dulled from all of the assualt.

It fades slow to leave just a little lace.  The smell is nice slightly sharp good strong hops with out being overly done. Some malty goodness in there at times.  The taste is very savory indeed. Great big hopy taste but not real sharp, kind of mild but defiantly Hops. A malty base to keep every thing where it needs to be.  The mouthfeel is very good, great carbonation, perfect medium body for this style. Man does this beer work.  Drinkability is top shelf, DFH nailed this one.

10099,6108,EvilKeith,3.62,"From notes of 08/06/06 visit to Delilah's, Chicago IL.  Poured into the glass a hazed rich golden color. The head was a finger and a half of off-white fluffy foam. The smell sweet malts, citrusy grapefruit, a bit floral and a subtle earthiness. Taste was actually malty sweetness up front, followed by hops, call them piney, grassy, and oily. The balance leans to the hop side, of course. At this point in my B.A. education I have come to enjoy a good American IPA. This is one of those good ones. Overall, I really enjoyed this one. FEAR NOT THE HOPS!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Estarrio,4.1,"Enjoyed on tap at the British Beer Company  Nice golden color with a light white head. Not much retention, save for some lacings.  After drinking the 90, 120 and some of Dogfish Head's other bigger offerings, I kept thinking that this was IPA Junior. It's alive with flavors and aromas. Raisin, vanilla, pine, and a complex array of hops are all present. The difference being that the flavors are not as strong as they are complex. The result is a fine beer that I consider a beginner version of those just getting into the American IPA.  It's smooth, well carbonated and very drinkable. Worth a try, as a great introduction to the style. Might let you down if you are a big hophead!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,expatsteve,4.45,"Appearance: Golden straw color, with low/medium viscosity. 1/2 inch head, settles to a nice heavy suds cover. Medium visibility. Lighter in color than I expected, but pleasant to look at.  Aroma: Caramel malts provide a good solid backbone for grapefruit, lemon rind, faint peaches and kiwi.  Taste: Great malt presence for an IPA - plenty of caramel in the front and middle palates. Hops really emerge in the middle palate and the finish, with fruity orange, apricot, and grapefruit notes. Sweet cantaloupe and kiwi developments. I never thought I'd complement DFH on achieving subtle, understated balance in a beer, but that's the character of the 60 Min.  Mouthfeel: Very light and smooth, with low/medium carbonation. Crisp, clean hops finish that doesn't overreach or smother the beer. Ideal summer IPA.  Drinkability: This is a fantastic beer, with great use of floral hops and just the right amount of bitterness. Nice malts carry the whole beer well. Will definitely drink this a whole lot more over the summer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,kimcgolf,3.98,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a golden-orange, with thin off-white head and great lacing. Aroma was not real pronounced, but a very pleasant mix of citrus and floral. Taste was a continuation of this floral and citrus, but what I noticed immediatley was the dominance of the alcohol. While only 6%, this hit me from the initial sip, and carried on thru the entire glass. The finish is bitter, yet smooth, but most of all leaves a warming sensation from the alcohol. In addition to the 60 minute, I also have the 90- and 120- minute, and cant wait to try those when the time is right. This was my first DFH, and I am truly pleased.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,rayjay,3.62,"One of the most delicious nights of drinking I ever had was in Philly. We went from Johnny Brenda's to the Standard Tap to the 700 Club and all 3 had this beer on the cask. All 3 places poured the best pints I've had in a long time; fresh, bitter, floral, just beautiful.  This review is of a 2 month old case, bought in PA in a hot beer distributor, carried back to CA, drank 1 month later.  Head is non-existant, beer tastes carbonated enough, but absolutely no lacing. Malt is light in color but much more present than the west coast IPA's I frequent, probably because of lighter hopping; for an IPA, it could be more counterbalanced with hops.  The hops are there in the usual flavors (pine, grapefruit, a little citrus) but are very dull for an IPA. Bitter, but not floral. Maybe I was expecting more since this is an old fav of mine. I shouldn't have drank a Drake's IPA before this one.  I believe this bottle is past it's prime, but is still good. Nothing compared to the fresh casks, that is when this beer really shines. I'd think it was alot better if I wasn't so spoiled on IPA's!!! Cheers",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,normZurawski,3.59,"It has an appearance like beer. It smells nice, light citris. Taste is slight rough, but decent. Seems to have 2 kinds of hops, if that makes sense. One of the I like and the other I do not. No malt, which makes this pale in comparison to the 90 MIPA. Decent beer but nothing special. Mouthfeel is creamy, actually nice. Drinkability is so-so. It's never the beer I'm looking forward to.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,jettjon,3.97,"Bar pour on tap into a cold glass. Dark yellow with no bubbles beneath a 1-finger light tan head that fades quickly to a thin sheet and good lacing. Noble? hops on the nose and sweet malt along with a light fruity smellpeaches or apricot. Taste is moderate hops up front, light malt, an apple juice or tea flavor. Finishes on a malty, moderately bitter hops flavor. Mouth is slightly creamy, full bodied without bubbles. Drinkability is very good. Id definitely recommend this excellent IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,RJLarse,3.62,"I picked up a couple of bottles of DFH 60 Minute IPA at a grocery store to taste, review and enjoy. I poured this beer in to a pint glass.  Pours a rich gold/amber color and is clear. A modest one-finger head forms, and dissipates quickly. The head produces minimal lacing on the sides of the glass.  The smell is very hoppy. There is a bit of a malt presence, and the aromas produced by the hops are mild.  The taste is also quite hoppy, with a malt backbone. There is a bitter hop finish. The flavors are not as varied and complex as they might be.  The mouth feel is crisp, clean and refreshing. The beer is moderately carbonated.  This is a drinkable beer. It lacks some of the fruity esters and citrus flavors of other IPAs, but a very drinkable beer and good representation of the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smells strongly of hops but there are also hints of citrus. Not overwhelming. Very nice. Taste is of hops and maltiness. Finishes bitter. Nice mouthfeel, goes down easy and has a good amount of carbonation. A great IPA and an excellent session beer.

The 60 minute poured a golden color with a thick white head that runs away rather quickly and leaves behind a nice ring around the glass and solid lacing. The aroma is trademark DFH, a bouquet of hops with a touch of sweetness at the end. The taste is more of the same with a citrusy hop kick that runs through the mouth and pleases. There is also a strong malt character that balances this beer out well and helps to make this a very drinkable beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,MLegendre,4.07,"A: Golden with a 1/2in. thick white head that disapates very slowly leaving very thick white lacing that sticks to the glass like it was crazy glue.  S: Smell is predominatly hops with a sweet background that kind of reminded me of a barley wine (interesting).  T: Starts of like the standard IPA, very bitter citrusy hops, but then when the malt kicks in I don't know what to call it. The malt is very strong, and like the smell, reminded me a bit of a barley wine or an Arrogant Bastard. Not nearly as overwelming as a Barley wine, but reminicent of one. Aftertaste goes back to the bitterness leaving an aspirin like aftertaste. As it warms up the maltiness gets stronger, but the bitterness is still very present. A very original take on an IPA.  M: Slightly thick, medium carbonation, very nice.  D: Well I am in love with this IPA. I haven't had anything else out there quite like it, and it is something I can see myself drinking very often. I think this beer will have something for both the hopheads and the maltheads.

10099,6108,keoki182,3.74,"Purchased in bottle in Menomonee Falls, WI. IPAs are growing on me more and more, ever since I tried Two Brothers Heavy-Handed IPA. I recall that one being quite good, but I could drink DFH 60 Minute all day. I naturally expected strong piney/citrus flavors and more bitterness than I am used to in a beer, but it was all done very well. The aroma is mostly hops, of course. The bitterness that I expected to taste however, is prevalent, but suits the beer so well you dont even mind. The mouthfeel is more solid than I had anticipated, lending a feeling that you are really drinking a fine brew. This is so good, I am going to search out the next step (90 Minute).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,oloughlinrj,4.42,"12 oz. bottle.  Pours golden orange with a thick, faomy head that dissolves down to a thin coating. This laces all the way down the glass.  Smells very hopsy, some floral citrus notes and the hint of buttery yeast. Quite pleasant. Strong, but not overpowering.  The taste is defined by the oily hops, which are present throughout and really take over. At the same time, this is balanced out by surprisingly sweet maltiness and a bready yeast, maybe some pine underneath. The strong hops make for a perfect bitter finish. This is one to be savored - let it linger on the palate.  Medium carbonation, good feel to it. It goes down easily, but makes its presence known. The finish is all hops, and they are there to stay (in a good way).  Overall, a great IPA. If you want strong hops, this is the beer for you. A friend recommended it to me, and I'll be thanking him profusely later. This is a beer to be cherished and enjoyed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Is this the greatest beer on the market or what? It pours an (IPA) perfect, creamy head that lasts all the way down. Lacing to the bottom of the mug. THE SMELL: of course, hoppy. with some wonderful malt thrown in. some sweetness from burnt sugar (carmel?) and a hint of chocolate. a little citrus fruitiness, maybe some orange peel. Man....oh man.

Smell is really hoppy, with a hint of sweetness. Taste is absolutely perfect. You can definately taste the hops but it is not over powering. The balance of this beer is what makes it so good....not too hoppy but still plenty of flavor. Nice mouthfeel...again it is perfectly balanced, not too thick but not watery like some other IPAs out there. I can't say enough good things about this beer...I almost prefer it to the 90 minute IPA which has a much stronger flavor (the 90 minute is an excellent beer don't get me wrong, i just think it's too much for a pale ale) This is a great beer to get your bud light buddies off of the watered down stuff....",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,bignick,4.35,"6-pack purchased from Marty's in Allston. Served in a complimentary pint glass.  This is a very good IPA. The copious hop bitterness is balanced by a sweetness that is not the least bit sticky. I like the way the grapefruit taste mixes with sweet taste of apricots and oranges. Very well-balanced, this beer is very nicely done.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,fisherman34,3.65,"Medium amber in colour with average carbonation. The aromas are quite well balanced between the light crystal malts, and the citrus-spice element of the hops. Full in the mouth, with the malt (both crystal and a bit of toasted) leading the way. The hops were there in abundance, but not so much as to overwhelm things. A very classy and refined IPA, although not overly complex.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,beerphilosopher,3.47,"My first of the 60, 90 and 120 IPA's of Dog Fish Head ... pours a medium yellow gold color with a slight cloudiness. Thin true white head with moderate size and retention. Nose is of hops, citrus, and a surprising amount of malt. The malt and hops are more in balance in the nose than I'd think for an IPA, though this is an American style. Palate is balanced as well, with the warm malts fighting for dominance over the pungeant, piney hops. A nice battle to host. Some citrus flavors linger and the beer finishes dry. Not thick in the mouth, but definitely a medium body. Adequate carbonation. Over all, I like this American IPA. Perhaps a touch malt dominant for me, but very drinkable none the less. Now, I'll need to sample the 90 and 120 varieties.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Avagadro,3.53,"So I've had a few of these and I think I've had a good chance to look at the beer from as many points of view as possible. To me this beer seems like the IPA fir stout lovers. The color is clear and amber with an off-white frothy head that lasts throughout the entire experience. Aroma is weak. Most IPAs have an aroma that just jumps at you, but with this you really have to look for it. What is there is a mix of hops and possibly roasted malt. The flavor follows this trend. For being an IPA, this just isn't cutting it for me in the hops department. I always thought dogfish head was a highly hopped brew, but the 60 minute just aint it. But I'm not going to rate it down just because it's not what I thought it was. The flavor starts with a mild hoppiness, and quickly is overtaken by what I percieved to be roasted malt. This is a very creative take on the IPA, but to me it is such an extreme changed that it doesn't really taste like an IPA anymore. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is decent. It's a tasty brew, but I don't think I would buy this again because it isn't as hoppy as I hoped it to be. Overall I think it's a tasty brew that tried to do something new. It pushed the boundries of IPA deeper into the malt direction (not the direction I want to see it go) but it is respectable for the brewer to brew what he thinks is best. In the end, I think this is a good brew. Don't go out looking for it, but if it's there sitting in the cooler, and you want something new, go for it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,soulgrowl,4.25,"Appearance: Crystal clear, sunny orange-yellow body with a respectable, foamy white head. Decent retention. No sign of sediment in my pour... this is bottle-conditioned?  Smell: Hops: loads of pine and grapefruit and light floral notes. It is very hoppy but quite mellow, with a lovely fruity malt background that underscores the hops' citric qualities very nicely.  Taste: Lush and fruity, and very well bittered. Hops wash over the entire palate for an immersive, full, round bitterness. Slight nutty malty sweetness provides a succulent, juicy body.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, nearly full-bodied, and extremely lush.  Drinkability: A great session beer, but if you're having it with other beers you should place this one towards the end of your session. Probably too bitter for most foods, but it would match well with spicy Thai or Indian or even Italian food.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,HoustonTX,4.4,"A - Amber in color, nice head - good retention, lacing is outstanding and all over the glass.  S - Smell is of floral and citrus.  T - Taste, while not as 100% complete as 90 minute DFH. Still comes off with it's own unique flavor. At first the nice citrus, pronouncially grapefruit and sour tones come through. Hops and mild waves of citrus follow through with a lovely balanced taste that exemplifies what a IPA should be about.  M - Refreshing, cleansing, and delightful. Great mouthfeel.  D - 6% and balanced to perfection. High Drinkabilty.  I was skeptical getting this instead of 90 Min DFH IPA. However, as part of BA, you just have to try them all. After crazy high expectations, this drink passed and then some. Definitely check 60 Min out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ahking,3.3,"This full bodied ale presents a very cool looking orange hue. A light amber but certainly orange hued. Didn't pour with a great head, but that may be a result of the glass I am forced to use (more of a water/drinking glass). Aroma is a nice caramel, toasted malt with a slight American hop pineyness. Flavor is rich malt caramel, slightly toasted specialty malts, with a good amount of hop bitterness. The biggest flaw in this beer as I see it is that it feels thick in your mouth. Not really a summer beer because it is so heavy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell - Citrusy hops aroma with a subtle maltiness.  Taste - Citrusy hops make their presence known and the malts give a great balance. I can get my hop fix here and this beer is certinaly always great tasting.  Mouthfeel - Light to medium in body, crisp carbonation.  Drinkability - Extremely drinkable, maybe too drinkable (if there is such a thing). Many nights have we cruised through 6 packsof 60 minute.

Ripe tangerine and grapefruit. Faint sweet candy malt.  T - Again, loads of citrus. Malts begin to show through more in the flavor than in the aroma. The IBU's seem higher than 60 to me for whatever that is worth. So fresh tasting. Tangerine is the primary citrus characteristic in the flavor. Well rounded malts, excellent IPA.  M - Medium bodied.

Taste: The hops are up front with a citrus bite, but is balanced with some malt sweetness, especially as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Above average.  Drinkability: Very good, a good mix of sweetness and bitterness and not too strong that you can't have two or three in a sitting.  A very good IPA that isn't available in Minnesota but luckily is usually around across the river in Wisconsin.

As for the taste. its a good example of its style I think. You can taste the hops a lot more than you can smell em. In fact, thats mostly what you can taste... and thats a good thing. Has a slight bitter after taste, but not excessive. has a nice mouth feel. perfect carbonation which helps spread the flovour.

The smell was a floral hoppy aroma that was just about perfect for an IPA.  The taste was a nice bitter hop flavor that balanced with a nice malty background. This beer was all about tasting the hops and it accomplished this nicely. The mouthfeel was the perfect thickness for an IPA, very smooth.  Overall a great beer and the best beer I have haed out of a bottle. Only bummer is that it is not easily found in california, but that's what UPS is for.

Smell if floral, hops, sweets and fruity, quite lovely  Taste is very smooth of hops, banana, apples and fruity. Very smooth while drinking it, reminds us of a juice to tell you how easy it is to drink it. You can feel the hops, but they dont take over the beer like so many AIPA.  Fruity hoppy smooth flavors, followed by a fresh hints of fruity esters, followed by a smooth caramel finish with a tints of spices",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,MeLikeBeer,4.15,"This is a great IPA.  Pours a golden amber color. Light head floats gently on top.

Tastes great...what can I say that hasn't already been said? Great bitter flavor, mixed with a light yeasty flavor. The malts are very sweet but balance nicely with the hops.

This beer comes out swinging with its punch of hop flavors. There is some lingering sweetness from the malts in the finish but this beer could do with a little more balance. It just doesnt accomplish that delicate balance that the great IPAs do like Victory's Hop Devil. The mouthfeel is great, nice carbonation and a good body. Overall extreamly highly drinkable.

10099,6108,Liquids,4.2,"Pours a lively amber-orange color with a white foam head, and notable carbonation. Surprisingly clear, looks breathtaking. Smell is intense--did I mention it smells delicious? Taste is clean, first pale, then sweet, then an inoffensive juicy hop explosion. Notably less grapefruity than 90 minute, but not as different and tame in comparison from the 90 minute as I originally recall. This beer is similarly insane, and is nearly balanced for an IPA--even closer to this amazing achievement than the 90 minute. It starts malty and finishes hoppy, but the two transition so perfectly... The hops don't linger all that long, and leave no bitter aftertaste, which is delightful. Mouthfeel is heavy, and not over carbonated. Perfect for the style. Very drinkable for style. I stock this on occasion, but of note, I find it nearly impossible to find anything to drink this along side of. Wings and IPAs/hops are a good combination, but this bad boy is extremely floral, which tends to clash with 'IPA"" kind of foods on my palate.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,VoodooBrew,4.15,"A biscuity, cake-like aroma emanates from the brilliantly clear golden copper body of this surprisingly balanced IPA. The nose eventually offers up some semi-sweet hop notes. The palate opens up with a sweetness that lasts for an instant before being chased by a firm bitterness that last into a nice long finish. The 60 Minute is hugely smooth -- goes down oh so easy, leaving a mild bitter feel. While still loaded with hop flavor and its share of bitterness, this is a smoother, rounder, softer IPA, which, may endear it with those seeking greater balance than is to be found in, say, a Stone offering.  I enjoyed this one with Julia and a few other friends. Thanks Jules!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,errantnight,3.98,"A staple! If not as good as in its bottle-conditioned days...  The 60 Minute IPA is always there for me (and for you!) and it's a delicious brew.  The one I poured out a little while ago had a thin head with excellent retention and mild but sustainable lacing. A rich golden hue and clear as day.  The aroma is predominantly a very clean pine with just a hint of malt.  The taste is clean and smooth (which makes this beer, despite the bitter bite and 6% ABV, very sessionable). The malt up front is barely there before it dissipates cleanly into a bit of oily hop and, ah! there's the pine notes with some citrus. The floral hop taste/smell is definitely on the back burner. There's just a touch of sweetness (more notable in the early tasting), then there's a sharpness of hop bitterness, and it shows up quickly at the back end of the pallet, and then goes, leaving a very clean, dry finish. After a moment, all that's left is a hint of the sweetness and some bitter edges.  This isn't my favorite IPA, I'm more partial to HopDevil and Stone IPA, but this is an excellent go-to beer with broad appeal, and is at the very least worth trying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

It has a typical grassy and pines note that it should,but it also seems to have a slight stench or skunkiness.  Taste: The flavors are of pines and grass. A mildly sweet maltiness with some oranges and an acidic citrusy lemon. Has a slight alcohol taste to it but not over doing.  Mouthfeel: The feel is smooth and slick at the same time.

Not citrusy or punchy at all, like most other american IPAs, kinda grassy, earthy, and overall reminiscent of damp earth. I'm guessing some Willamette in here, or Mt. Hood. Probably my least favorite varieties, but it works out ok in this one. Creamy, sweet malt background, a little biscuity, with a bit of peachy fruitiness. The flavor opens up sweeter than most IPAs, a generous pale malt sweetness hints at turbinado sugar. Modest estery fruit, kind of a brown pear or dried peach flavor. Grassy, woody hop flavor creeps in early, presenting the beer as overall earthy. Fairly agressive hop finish, with moderate bitterness. Very earthy, grassy and woody. Full bodied, with milder carbonation. Pretty smooth drinking. Easy to take down a couple and relax with. Like all DFH stuff, this one comes off on the sweeter side.

The sweetness is subtle, though, and this beer is dry for the most part. The hop flavor here is quite bright and flowery.  Carbonation is slight and and the medium body feels smooth. 4 This makes for a solid, sessionable beer.  This used to be my favorite IPA. It's different now (since no longer being bottle conditioned) and I don't like it quite as much. The flavor isn't as smooth, deep and balanced -- it's harsher now.

Some honey and floral notes appear deeper into the sips. Great creamy slickness in the mouth.  This is a good go-to IPA if you're not up for the more intense offerings out there.

Pungent floral grapefruit rind hop aromas over cookie dough malt sweetness... delectable aroma.  Medium bodied, slick chewey mouth feel...  ...the taste is almost a perfect balance of piney/cedar chip hops and chewy caramel malts....finishes wet where a bready decernment occurs which is then taken over by a lingering and increasing metallic bittering (mild and pleasnt bittering).

M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Doesn't make me go wow, but doesn't get in the way.  D - Nice. I like it. Quite ""full flavoured"" but not overly bitter. Good sessionable beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,CAMRAhardliner,4.69,"Pours a perfectly clear light bronze color, paler than I expected. The head is huge and creamy with excellent retention. Massive lace patches stick to the glass. The aroma is stacked with hop oils, fruit and pithy pine. Great malt presence is also in the nose, but the hops are first. The taste is hoppy but not extremely hoppy. Theres plenty of pine, Citrus rind, and herbally bitter hops. Malt is bready, doughy and never overly sweet. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and saturated with tiny carbonation bubbles. The finish is nicely bitter with malt as well.  This is a fantastic session beer. Its hoppy enough but also well balanced. My only question is why is it crystal clear if its bottle conditioned? I guess you dont have to get sediment and haze from it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,hoppymeal,3.82,"Light copper with a creamy head. Fresh herbs, sweet pine, and some sweet orange smells.

10099,6108,Redrover,4,"I had a pint at the Beer Bistro on Madison Avenue in Chicago. Great place to go visit in the near west side of the City.  The beer was dark copper with an off-white head an decent lacing.  The smell was appetizing and fresh. a lots of citrus and a bit of grain.  The taste is very solid and brisk. I like the how grapefruit taste complements the cracker like malts. Well balanced.  Smooth, creamy mouth that adds to the drinkability. All-in-all a well made easy drinker.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,Caesar1pup,4.22,"Dogfish Head, what the hell does that even mean? Who really cares because it's good stuff. Get some!  Orange in color with minimum head. Strong pine and floral scent and hoppy as an IPA should be.  Well balanced and very drinkable. You are rewarded with well above average flavor, hops, hops and hops. Taste is much like the smell, which is good. Finishes clean and very refreshing.  Overall I would recommend this to my friends and will look for it again myself.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,objectivemonkey,4.3,"For a bottle conditioned beer, this is actually quite clear, a golden amber color, with about one inch of head. Floral hops take the lead, obviously, sweet buttery malts in the background. Taste is citric hops, a little oily in taste and mouth.

10099,6108,KyleVick4,4.92,"Awww man I hate to do this, but the taste was so good it is my second 5, but if I could give it a six I would.  A: A dark golden light amber color with a nice assertive head that dies down enough for you to drink it without it getting in your way. Lacing is ok, but the beer keeps a fine layer of head all the way down.  S: Mmmm a great balance between hop freshness and the sweetness of the malt. Smells a little toasty also...  T: Wow. This is a good IPA. This is a great IPA. This is the most drinkable IPA I have ever had. Tastes a strong malt backbone with the presence of hops in the foreground. Has a nice toasted malt taste that is not overpowering. The hops do not overpower they mix tremendously with the grain. Superb.  M: Light bodied for an IPA. Smooth and even a little silky. I think just the right amount of carbonation, lets you know it is there but does not overpower you. Not syrupy at all.  D: Could drink this beer all night, day and afternoon if my liver would let me. Not the typical IPA more of a cask ale type of beer. Woulnt believe the 6% if it werent on the label. This beer doesnt whisper for another sip, it screams for one.  To the brewers at Dogfish Head: Job well done.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TheBungyo,3.56,"I've had limited contact with east coast IPA's. This is a beer that raises questions for me. For instance, are we out west conditioned to view what the taste of an IPA is differently than the east? The reason I ask is that I have detected a weird corn-like taste in some of the east coast IPA's I've tried. It seems far more common in the IPA's out east. These IPA's are also rated and thought of somewhat highly. The pour of this beer is quite nice. An inch of head caps off this autumn hued brew. I smell the dreaded corn-like smell along with a hint of grapefruit. Taste is initially the corn taste I dislike, followed by a mingled pine and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, very nice. Lacing has followed my progress all the way down the glass. To be honest, I don't want another. It's ok. Nothing more. That corn taste just kills the beer for me. In a pinch I suppose I could tolerate it if I wanted some hops. Living out west though, that isn't likely to happen. A good IPA can be found almost everywhere.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Leaves thick stalagtite/stalagmite lacing. Smells of toasted malts, some welcome diacetyl, and a grassy hop profile. Taste is of bready malts and grassy, herbal and citrusy hops. Some faint diacetyl as well. This beer seems a bit cloying overall and a touch grainy. The sweetness doesn't work too well, but some hop bitterness helps to bring it together.

Smell : Lots of pine, some citrus. Sweet malt in there, too. Smells like a good IPA should.  Taste : Much pine upfront, good. Sweet malt, too sweet, not good, but sort of just hanging in the background, as opposed to being the backbone. Hints of diacetyl, definitely not good. Elements not balanced, and I don't think it's exactly off kilter by design to promote some aspect (as hops e.g.), but rather, ... it's just not coming together the way an AIPA should, or even as was promised by the nose. Still, the hops are good, it's the malt I' m not liking here.  Mouthfeel : full, moderate carbonation, nice hops slickness. Good piney aftertaste.

There's enough malt flavor to back up the hoppiness, but then again the hoppiness is mild compared to the 90 minute. There's a decent hop flavor in this beer, but it is not especially bitter. The flavor is very fruity, with apricot and apples. Medium mouthfeel. Good drinkability. A good IPA, but what's the point when 90 minute is just as easy to get?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,PBRstreetgang,2.98,"Pours a pale amber/gold with decent clarity. One and a half fingers of dense white head shows decent retention and excellent lacing. Moderate aroma of cascade and toasted amber malt. Mild toasty sweetness with the first sip, followed by a rush of solid bitterness but lacking in hop flavor. Some ghost-like cascade notes in the dry aftertaste, but overall dissapointing for an American IPA. The medium body and light carbonation give it a semi-smooth mouthfeel but it's also kind of boring. The stale finish becomes so dry it boarders on harsh and hurts the drinkability.

A bit of acidic alcohol tingles the nose.  Taste- Hops, hops, and more hops. Hop oil to be more specific. There is a bit of a balancing effort that comes through as some sweet malt is evident. Some slightly more than moderate alcohol reveals itself from the beginning og the sip to midway through.  Mouthfeel - Very ""wet"" on the palate until it ends semi-dry with a strong hop aftertaste.

Taste. This is a textbook IPA. Crisp hop bite, mellow malt aftertase, with fruity undertones, kind of pear-like.  Mouthfeel is fine. It works just like it's supposed to . The hop hit you expect on the palate, followed by a smooth sensation as it goes down.  Drinkability. Very refreshing. It's a bit high in aclohol for a session beer, but the drinkabilty makes it appropriate for more than one.  It's a very good beer. I'm trying to keep a supply laid in as one of my standbys.

Color is a rich golden orange that is very clear. The head is medium and build and a little frothy. While it did shrink down it still held on for quiet alwhile the entire time I was drinking.  The smell is a very rich hoppey aroma. The first aromas to come through are apricot and tropical fruits.  The taste has a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue and screams of more hops. Some citrus is there but isn't very pronounced. It is a bit sharp in the taste and can be a bit much if you don't like hoppy beers. I usually have one or two and move onto something else.

The bouquet bursts full of citrus and grass--so far this is has the looks of a genre-defining brew, along the same lines as Bell's Two Hearted.  Alas, the taste doesn't follow through on the promise of the appearance and smell. The bitterness is well-balanced, yet the malt body is too watery for my palate. The earthiness of the hops make for a delicious mouthfeel overall and this goes down easily, but I think that what is lacking here a well-rounded backbone to the beer.  Here's to a beer that's got tons of potential and may be on its way to getting greater than great. Hopefully they'll continue to tinker with the recipe, and even until then, it's more than worth a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Very aromatically hoppy nose, showing the lemony/citrusy Amarillo and the floral Warrior along with a touch of malt, which hints of caramel and biscuits. Hops dominate the flavor providing a very fruity blend of apricot, orange, citrus fruits, lemon and a touch of wheat grass. The malt underneath shows a bit of biscuits and butter toffee, balancing fairly well. An undeniably great India Pale Ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Taste: Yikes! so much hop bitterness which is to be expected, this ipa has some faint bitter fruit in it with some floral taste as well.  mouthfeel: dry and refreshing, i cant help but sip this very slowly as the hops remain in your long after you have swallowed.  drinkability: i enjoyed this but i took me about 30 minutes to finish a 12 ounce bottle. and about another thirty to scrub off the glass because of all the lace. i will definitely buy this beer again, great for a sunny day",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Gagnonsux,4.23,"60 Minute is copper with plenty of carbonation. The off-white head is very large and fluffy. Aroma is of citrusy hop and an underlying biscuity malt. The overall smell is just a bit underwhelming for an IPA. Taste is of a tangy, citrussy hop, with notes of pineapple. Underlying malt is of caramel and biscuit. The different flavors mix nicely and are complexly layered. Bitterness is moderate. The overall taste of 60 Minute is unlike any IPA I've expirienced, which took about half a bottle to get used to.

Bottle says this is bottle-conditioned but I don't see any sediment in the bottle - even when empty i don't see the sediment.  Taste pretty much as i expected - very hoppy intense tones throughout, though a little more malt in the taste than normal for an IPA. The strong hop character prevails into the finish, which is mild and pleasant.  This is a *very* pleasant version of the style, the best session IPA I have found in the US.

Good bite of citrus when sampled that mellows into a suprisingly balanced brew as it warms. Pleasantly bitter aftertaste.  This one is a regular in my beer fridge and I always really enjoy that first spicy sip.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Oxymoron,4.05,"I suppose saying 3,600 seconds is a bit harder to say then 60 minutes. Pours a very light cloudy yellow orange color. Good white frothy head and limited lace. Although did hide around the edges over time.  The smell is hoppy. A good pine and citrus kick that blends well. The malt is limited but some basic pale malt is detectable.  The taste is more balanced then the nose would indicate. A good malt taste with a grainy and caramel combo taste. A sweet taste but not overpowering. Overall the malt still plays second to the hops. The hops are well balanced. At the bittering end, there is a good piney taste mixed with a touch of earthy flavors. This is followed, and noted blended really well, with a mild citrus taste.  The body has a medium feel and good carbonation round out a good beer. Overall this is a good beer for an IPA style.

10099,6108,orfeu,4.44,"Golden amber with giant soapy white lather and sparse but persistent carbonation. How many citrus fruits are there? This one has aromas of all of them -- I'm picking up kumquat, grapefruit, lime and tangerine (piney rind) at the very least. Lacing clumps around the entire glass. All those citrusy hops I smelled are seriously restrained in the taste. Caramelly-toasty malt balance is assertively in effect. Refreshing peach-lemon flavors. Piney tangerine pith finish lingers long after the swallow. Juicy mouthfeel, thin-to-medium body. Quenching! Not the hop bomb I expected, but gaddam if this isn't one super-drinkable brew. From classic to extreme, from Belgian to beefy American, from populist to just plain weird, Dogfish Head's got it all.

The hop nose is unbelievable. No matter where I get this on tap it seems they have it fresh from the brewery. Maybe they do since it's so good it probably doesn't sit around long. This beer introduced me to Amarillo hops. I was taken away by the citrusy hop flavor and had to do some research to find out at least one hop they used. The bitterness is not carried away like some IPA's either and it is balanced nicely with a sturdy malt base. Highly recommend!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

I have heard a lot of back and forth about how big the DFH beers are and to be honest I procrastinated going here for a while. As it happened this became part of a trade and a perfect time to give it a shot. I am glad I did.  Appearance: Pours a clear light orange with a creamy off white head and stays frothy the entire duration of the beer. Significant lacing.  Smell: The smell is a lot sweeter than I expected. Amazingly pleasant sweet malt and hop balance in the nose. There is the green attribute in the aroma but I did not find it to be overly pine and grassy it was subdued. Nestled comfortably in a bed of sweet citrusy sugar and caramelized malts. Somewhat earthy. Very nice!  Taste: Like the smell I was pleased to find this beer to be so approachable. There is definitely the green hop attribute but it is not cloyingly piney. It is infact rather sweet as well. There is a bit of bread fruit and yeast that all blend together with the green hop flavor and make a very pleasing gentle bouquet of a flavor that fill the taste buds but does not overwhelm them. Excellent! The aftertaste comes in about three separate waves. First dry then bitter then sweet, very interesting.  Mouthfeel: I couldnt ask for more. It is a full mouthfeel that is very smooth and a bit chewy and yet the hops keep it feeling crisp.  Drinkability: Very drinkable! It goes down easy and maintains its level of appeal to the very end. What an enjoyable beer. I got one in a trade and I think I will seek out more in the future.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!  THANKS: Thanks to tgbljb for the trade! Heres to finding good beer in Lancaster PA :) Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,gdogalishus,3.54,"Poured from the tap into a pint glass. The 60 minute IPA has always had 2 distinct flavors to me. If you have it from the bottle, chances are you get a metallic flavor in the background. If you have it from the tap or at the brewery, then the real character of this beer shines through. There is a good hoppy bitterness that is softer than the 90 minute and easier to drink hidden inside. A lighter color than 90 minute. If I had to guess, the hops in the 60 are definately lower in cohumulone than those used in the 90... but I can't say that for certain. Maybe my alcoholism is shining through on this statement, but a really good session beer. I can spend an evening (or a whole boche tornament weekend) enjoying this beer. Motley Brew! Motley Brew!

Smell is definatly of the hops , fresh-green and citric aromas and a bit of yeast.  Taste is very clean and hoppy. Much citrus-orange , bitter, oily hop flavors coat the tongue, some balancing bready malt presence, then more green-earthy tones and a bit of cedar.

10099,6108,Rezzin,4.6,"A - Crisp clean copper color with a beautiful fluffy head that just stays forever.  S - Sweet. Floral, citrusy, orange with some malt.  T - Right away I don't think IPA, it's more like hoppy APA. Sweet but not at all in a bad way. There is a nice malt backbone with some very floral orang-ish hops taste/aroma to it. I've heard Amarillo is very grapefruit like but I'm detecting orange. If there ever was a hoppy APA candy, this would be it.  M - Very smooth and rich but in a light refreshing way. Moderatly carbonated with a slight slight bitterness in the back that crisps things up.  D - I live on the west coast and picked up two 6-packs while I was on a business trip to Texas. I really wish I could find this in California. It really doesn't strike me as an IPA however. It's not as bitter as most of the other IPA's I've tried. Very sessionable. If this were an APA I would say it's outstanding. Even as an IPA it's still a solid beer. I would highly recommend this one if you get the chance. The next time I'm out there I'm trying this on tap and bringing back a case or two.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,skillerified,3.8,"Very clear and somewhat pale orange-yellow in color. Huge head that's very bubbly and fizzy (admittedly, I poured it a little fast on accident). The head doesn't seem to want to go away. Lots of small, fine carbonation bubbles are visible and rising quickly. Excellent lacing.  Full of thickly concentrated fruity and floral notes with a hint of spice and a dash of malt. The fruit and flower notes seem to be non-descriptive. That is, they're just general scents as opposed to a specific fruit or flower. It's a very tasty smell.  The flavor kind of hits the tongue in two layers at the same time. The bottom layer is a sweet malty flavor. And the top layer is a nice hoppy bitterness. It's strange that they seem to almost function separately and at the same time. An interesting taste for sure. There is a touch of an alcoholic spicyness too. Pretty good stuff.  Mouthfeel is suprisingly light. The carbonation is not as aggressive on the tongue as it is in the glass. There's an early sweetness and a late, coating bitterness. The finish comes and goes pretty quickly. Seems about average for an IPA.  Fairly tasty and easy to drink, but I think there are better IPAs out there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,tomParis,4.07,"This is one of the smoothest, most refreshing IPAs around. The combination of hops in this beer give it a very unique taste and aroma. The best I can describe it is crisp and clean. Nothing overly complex, mostly floral and citrus hops with just enough malt to balance it out.  The mouthfeel is a little thin, but not necessarily a bad thing. A very drinkable IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,copasetic,4.04,"Pours a deep orange with a moderate head, which quickly dissapates to thin lacing. Very clear. The aroma is strongly cirtus/floral, a hallmark of American hops. I think this is dominated by Simcoe hops. Pungent, sweet, and delicate. The mouthfeel is relatively thin and the taste is smooth with a bitter kick. On the bitter, kick you in the butt end of a session beer, but for those of us who are IPA-afficianados, perfect.  A very fine standard IPA. Floral, citrusy, moderately bitter, and not so heavy that you can't keep drinking.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ghostwalker,4.4,"A 12 oz bottle serving.  Pour is clear orange body with a frothy white head, nice lacing.  Nose is malty citrus. A well balanced IPA nose that gets the old taste buds ready for action.  Flavor is incredible. A perfect blend of hops, both citrus and floral, and a solid malt backbone. Really close to IPA perfection.  Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation and that characteristic IPA zip.  Drinkability is tops, I crave the DFH 60 minute IPA. Luckily I can find it on tap close to home for about $3.50 a pint.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,jockstrappy,3.85,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beer pours a nice copper color, with a foamy head that settles quickly, providing spotty lacing. The smell of this brew is mainly hops, very piney also. As for the taste, hops dominate (not such a bad thing)! A little malt presence on the palate, but the hops completely overpower anything else one might detect, and as it warms, hops just become that much more dominant. Great carbonation and a somewhat light body make this beer very drinkable. A bit too hoppy for me, but still a great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ericj551,4.01,"This beer pours a nice orange with a big lingering head. The head really sticks around on this one, and the lacing sticks nicely to the glass. Perfect appearance for an IPA in my opinion. All I can smell is hops, strong pine and citrus. The taste again is all hops, a strong hop flavor, backed up by a nice bitterness. There is a sweet maltiness in the background but it just gets hammered by the hops. I'm not sure I could drink more then a couple of these in a sitting but damn is it a nice IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Tupperwolf,3.11,"Pours out a very clear amber with distinct rising bubbles and a fluffy stark white head - the kind of appearance that makes the old timers slowly nod their heads and murmur, ""Yep, thassa' IPA."" No mistaking it.  I was priveleged enough to enjoy a four-pack of 90 minute IPA recently, so I was looking forward to trying the less-hopped, easier-drinking 60 Minute. However, my nose was quite dissappointed upon first poke into the glass. The hops seemed boring, even slightly stale, but I don't think there was anything wrong with the bottle - merely hopped lower than I was used to. Vague citrus sits on top of a noticeable malt backbone.  Flavor.. I'd almost call this a well-hopped pale ale, instead of an IPA. The hops just don't play as big of a role as I'd like. The flavors mirror those of the 90 minute, but are so weak as to make this beer... sad to say.. a bit boring. Not bad! It's above average, I think, just a bit weak compared to its big bro. Let's face it, I'm biased.  Nothing wrong with the mouthfeel - a bit of soft fizz to keep things interesting, a small amount of oil from the hops. It's beery.  Obviously, I'm bummed out. If you like hops even a little, skip this and jump up to the 90 Minute. It's so much better, in my opinion.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Melchizedek,3.7,"Pours a very comely bronze with a two-finger off-white head. Sexy.  Smells of hops, tart fruit, resin, a little alcohol. In the mouth, there's a bit of a metallic tinge, plus plentiful helpings of all manner of hops - woody, resiny, leafy. There's some yeast and malt in there somewhere, too - it's not too overwhelming in bitterness.  I'd drink this as a session finisher, not more than a couple at a time - it's a good hop fix, and a very respectable IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,tegelaar,4.38,"I love this IPA! It goes down very smooth. Very pleasant smelling.with a hint of floral. It has a lot of taste but is so easy to drink. It pours with small, thick head and drinks with a beatiful lacing down the side of the glass. If I had to pick one beer to drink the rest of my life, this would be it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,scruffwhor,4.41,"Apperance- Pours a light spritzy, eggshell colored head with half-way decent retention. Color is a general amber with some copper notes. Some struggling bubbles makes its way to salvation, or the surface of the brew.  Smell- A great mix of fresh baked bread, KFC biscuits and very aromatic hops. It was like a flower shop and bakery were all combined into one store.  Taste- All I can say is that this beer was like a good bitter bread. The malt really tricked my mind into thinking it was drinking bread with a little hop jelly.  Mouthfeel- An undeniable hop presence, but yet a good dose of malt as well. The balance of this beer was excellent. The bread dough malts and floral/citric hop bitterness was a great combo.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Zorro,4.77,Sampled through the efforts of Murrayswine and UTBIF!  Pours a clear golden amber colored ale with a good off white head.  Smell is on the sweet side with a good resinous hop aroma. Hops are spicy with a smoky herbal aroma that is most pleasant to the nose. Malt scent is a little honey like but mostly it stays out of the way of the hops.  Taste is sweet spicy and woody at the very start. Malt takes a back seat to the hops as expected and quite tasty hops they are! Fresh and spicy from the very start this tastes like surprise very fresh hops there is no other way to describe it. Mild bitterness is very unobtrusive and is perfectly balanced to the malt load here. The malt isn't a major factor in the taste here and only gives this a little sweetness. One of the tastiest IPAs ever but to my probably warped taste buds this is more a very good APA than an IPA to me.  Good mouthfeel.  An exceptionally good drinker here! Not over the top in bitterness this is just an extremely tasty strong APA to weak AIPA. Loads of spicy hops in not excessive quantities are what make this beer so good.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TheManiacalOne,4.22,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.  A: Pours an amber color with a little bit of an orange tint. Makes a decent white head which thins a bit quickly and doesn't leave too much lacing.  S: The hops prevail in the smell but not over-powering along with some citrus. A very good combination and blend.  T: A very well-balanced taste. It has the hops flavor and bitterness, which isn't too strong and it has a touch of citrus sweetness. Even though the bitterness comes out a little more in the after-taste, you can still taste the balance.  M: Very crisp, medium carbonation and a nice finish.  D: Goes down very easily and is not very filling. If you get a sixer, you can make it disappear quite quickly. As far as I'm concerned this beer is extremely versatile. I can see myself pounding it away, because of its drinkability and enjoyable taste. I can also see myself enjoying it with a meal because it's not over-powering, but has enough flavor to compliment whatever you're eating. Overall it's a very good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,UncleFlip,4.3,"Honey with orange-peach overtones, and just a touch hazy. Head is off-white, just under a finger, and falls at a decent rate.  Smell is all about some piney and some floral hops. Thre's a little malty sweet nose, but let's face it- it's all about the hops.  More balanced than the smell would imply. A sweet but htink matiness hits first, then the hops build quickly, and go through some subtle flavour metamorphosis. The malt comes back for a curtain call.  There seems to a be a subtle, very low, tight carbonation paired with a higher, looser one that hits on the front of the tongue. Liquid is hearty, yet easy-going.  Certainly not the hoppiest beer out there- but will satisfy the hophead in you. I think it would be a great beer for mild hopheads. It goes down easy and the hops are not so strong they drive you away.  Be well -UF",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Drew966,3.75,"Pours a nice amber with a thick head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Hints of citrus in the aroma. As expected, hops are in the forefront of the flavor. There is some grapefruit in the after taste and some astringency in there as well. Frankly, it's not bad, but I've had other IPA's that I liked better. That being said, this is quite drinkable and most definitely worth a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,danielocean03,4.4,"Pours a crystal clear copper toned amber color with a thin white head that falls to light white lacing. Aroma is comprised of a blend of citrus, floral and evergreen/pine hops, slightly sweet nose. Smells absolutely outstanding, excellent hoppy aroma, exactly what I expect from an IPA. Taste is also hop-dominated, very fresh hop bitterness accompanies grapefruit and citrus flavors, along with grassy undertones present as well. Taste is very clean and refreshing, very quaffable beer. Light to medium body, lighter end of the carbonation spectrum. Very drinkable, hoppy as you want yet still only 6% abv, would make a nice session IPA. Will definitely seek out again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,gbarron,3.76,"A - golden to light amber. Perfectly clear. Small, off-white head forms, and then disappears to a pool of disjointed bubbles in the middle, a ring around the edge of the glass. A little lacing the whole way.  S - very little aroma in this sample. Light citrus notes, light toasty malt. A little disappointed in the lack of aroma.  T - Strong, citrusy, piney hop flavor. Very fresh hop taste. Hops completely dominate. Toasty, sweet malt flavor in the background. Grapefruit flavors, assume hops are of the American NW variety. Very dry.  M - thin to moderately thin body, medium to low carbonation. Dry.  D - highly drinkable IPA. Reminds me a lot of Anchor Liberty Ale. Tastes like a classic American IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,dawg,4.15,"From the bottle into a stout glass. Nice white head and lacing. Hop aroma. Very crisp. Mild citrus. Smells of fresh hop flower. Not piney. Just smells like fresh hops on the vine. Maybe a little dry malts peaking through.  Poured crystal clear. I was expecting some cloudiness as it is conditioned in the bottle. No floaters or clouds. Very, very clear. Nice head retention, no bubbles. Lack of bubbles probably due to the glass style. Looks delightful.  Tastes like hop flora. Very dry and drinkable. I'm not a hop head nor a huge IPA fan. This is damn tastey though. Taste and aroma makes me reflect on my last homebrewing experience. Crushing the hops in my hands for the big whoft.  Feel is rather bubbly, light, and soft. A big sip down quick released an internal aroma of citrus fruits mostly lemon/lime. Possibly some fresh mowed grass. Yeah, some cut grass.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase. There are eight of these in the ""boom box"" case. Might need to grab a case of this stuff on its own. Probably a good beer for macro drinkers. Very crisp and clean, directly to the point. Good beer.  Yum.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,Hautacam,4,"Since I first had this, it has been a staple in my fridge. It's just a really good IPA. Piney hops dominate the smell and flavor. A good bitterness, nice carbonation and a semi dry finish. It always taste great on its own or with food. A friend brought this to a cookout and served it with grilled sausages....everyone went nuts for it. For a few weeks after that cookout, this was that I drank.

Appearance - Poured clear light copper with a huge head that lingered and left clouds of sticky lace. Lots of carboation ro feed the head as the beer is consumed.  Taste is agressive floral and citrus hops. Some pine, a little iodine and a solid malt backbone with some toasted breadiness and a little caramel. A hoppy beer for sure but built on a strong foundation.  Mouthfeel is medium to light. It clears the palate rather quickly but not before slaking my thirst and pairing nicely with a slice of sausage pepperoni and anchovy pizza.  Exceptionally drinkable.

10099,6108,chrisms86,4.39,"I'd started to get tired to IPAs and after not having one for a while picked up this one from Dogfish Head. Not as sharp a spice as other brews which makes it more drinkable, but being an IPA it is still handicapped in the drinkability catagory.

The hoppiness was there as it should have been along with a dominant yeastiness.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability - Very dry, but not in a bad way. This beer finishes clean without excessive bitterness.

There is a light hint of citrus in the nose.  It tastes like fresh bitter hops, light malts and is a little buttery. There is definitely a hint of yeast and finishes with an extensive butter hops tang. It is also a little nutty. This beer finishes somewhat dry. The mouth feel is pretty average here, definitely not watery.  This beer is not quite what I was expecting, but I dont mean that in a bad way. It is good in many ways and I think that it is an ideal example of an IPA. It is a good one to have aroundbut not for friends.

Taste- Very watery orange/ grapefruit rind. Not as strong as the smell would suggest. Mouthfeel- slighty flat. Just when you think its goning to hit you with that dry bitter IPA flavor it fades!  Overall- An IPA that has the makings of an excellent 1 but just falls short.  -edit- I'll try the 90 minute again. This time I'm sure it'll be more to my liking.

Smells heavily of grapefruit, orange peel, other good leafy stuff that I can't really pick out. Pine?  The taste: yeah, the bitterness is there all right but it's not overpowering. This lingers in the aftertaste, where I pick up an earthy/grainy note at the very end. That stays with you for a while afterward. Some kind of wood? I wonder how long they age this beer, and what they age it in.  I think this is very drinkable. It's not too bitter, not too carbonated. As I empty the glass I feel the alcohol presence.

10099,6108,JoeyHotrod,4,"4's across the board from my perspective.  A good, though not great IPA. Dogfish Head 60 minute is a worthy brew for a hophead to take on, but don't expect a classic by any means.  Upon pouring a somewhat large head forms, but is gone within 20 seconds or so. The beer itself looks like what you would expect, given the style. A definite orarange hue, with a slight cloudiness to it. A pretty nice looking beer really.  The smell is of... you guessed it hops! Almost like smelling a fresh pine tree. Very appealing if you're into hoppier beers.  The taste is to be perfectly honest a little more malty than what I expected, granted I'm starting to become more and more of a fan of hoppier beers, so my opinion may be somewhat clouded in that regard. Regardless malt was at the forefront. As I drank a little further the hops began to make themselves known a little more and you could no doubt taste them. Sure it's hoppy, but not nearly as hoppy as what one would think.  I could see a person drinking quite a few of these without problem, has definite session brew potiential. All things taken into account I stand by my good, but not great comment. There's a little something lacking and it's not quite as hoppy as what I would like.  I'm glad I was able to try it and would drink it again in the future, but it's not going to replace The Two Hearted in my fridge anytime soon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

T - Initial pine and lightly floral kick, then a medium bitter finish with a lingering pine flavor.  M - Thin, it is refreshing but the lingering pine flavor tried hard to convince me otherwise.  D - I will have this again. I like this beer a lot, but here is how it is. One of these beers satisfied me. I could have easily gone and refilled my glass off of my friend's tap, but I chose not to do that. Why? Because I didn't want another beer right away. This is an IPA that is to be savored.

Slowly settles to a short collar leaving some lacing. Soft copper with golden highlights, and only a few lazy carbonation streams. The smell is bright green hops, piney with touches of citrus. The taste is of bold hops in the front, softening in the middle with finishes of malt sweetness, but still packing plenty of hops oil. Medium bodied with modest carbonation, this feels nice.

10099,6108,snilsen13,3,"Smooth and comforting, this is a great beer. Finally I can buy at my local store! It doesn't offer an exotic flavor or peculiar aromas but instead feels like a well balanced strong IPA. What do I mean by that? I guess I mean it is mildly favored given it's strength and has a bitterness that goes down very easy. I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to folk who are not accustomed stronger beers, and it would be a great launching pad for the pallate in an evening of heavy beers. I think the key to this brews greatness is BALANCE.  It tastes great and drinks great. It's hard to stop at one.  EDIT: Years later, this beer still surprises me when I try it. This has got to be the best widely available IPA coming off the East Coast.  EDIT: bought a 12 pack for nostalgia's sake. This is the modern definition for an mellow IPA. It tastes very average to me now, clean but simple. The nose is unremarkable and the draw to stick with it after having one is pretty much ""meh"". No mojo left to DFA60.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,jaluria,4.12,"One of the better, smoother AIPAs out there. The appearance is nothing unusual for this style with a slightly orange hue and an off-white colored head that doesn't last. Aromas of hops, pairs, and oranges can be detected. The taste is filled with hops that outlast the malt profile, as might be expected for this style. Despite the bitterness, this beer is suprisingly smooth and refreshing with a crisp character closely resembling a pilsener. The beer leaves behind a nice roasted flavor and coats the tongue nicely. The flavor, moderate ABV, and smoothness of this beer allow it to be had multiple times.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,jslot38,4.3,"Presentation: 12 oz Bottle; Spot for 'date packaged', but not marked.  Appearance: Luxurious white head forms over a clear copper body. Carbonation clearly visable. Lacing is... hmmm... whats the word... perfectly sticky. Head diminishes to a top covering, not a hole to be found.  Smell: Floral, pine hops. Mild hints of orange, a bit zesty, a bit peel. A note of alcohol presence.  Taste: Lovely use of hops, bittering effect upfront. Pine forms a solid background to a nice floral and earth toned character. Malt background is limited and encourages a lingering hop presence (oily), a bit sweet on the tongue, with a note of orange rind.  Mouthfeel: Perfect carbonation level, smooth finish (while hoppy, the hop oils mellow this out to near perfection), crisp indeed.  Drinkability: I've already declared this to be my perfect session beer, could drink many of these in a night, and have.  Notes: As my introduction to Dogfish Head, I am certainly intrigued. This is a perfect IPA to sit back and have one to experience a great beer, or just waste the night away with a few friends. Good luck removing this one of my list of favorite IPAs, and beers for that matter.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,IceAce,4.52,"Twelve ounce bottle with an unused 'Packaged In' notch code section on the label.  Manderin orange body capped with a crater-filled two fingers of off-white foam. Nose is sweet with malt and saliva-producing citrus. Thus far, every wonderful thing i've heard about this beer is true...  Carbonation literally dances on the middle of the tongue upon entry. Midtaste features a blend of malts that appear equal parts Brit and Yank...deep and delectable with a balancing sweetness.  The finish is kicked off with a crescendo of hoppy goodness that begins on the citrus side and finishes with a pine studded floral fade.  Mouthfeel is spot on with just a hint of slickness noted on the rear section of the mouth's roof. Worthy of all of the praise that it has received...this brew is a definite winner!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,kmcnair,3.97,"12oz bottle sample, pours a very clear light copper color and makes a tight bubbled, thin white head. Aroma is crisp biscuit malts, light caramel, orange and grapefruit. Moderate peppered bitterness attacks the tastebuds with some pine and citrus fruit, earthy hop character which reminds me of colombus, hint of alcohol in the end. Crisp carbonation, light bodied and finishes dry. This is a rock solid sessionable IPA, I would buy this quite often if it were available in San Diego.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Frozensoul327,4.23,"My first brew from DFH. Pours out to a orange/bronze color with a nice 1/4 inch head of foam. Lace looks like mountains on a skyline. Nice. Aroma is very hoppy and fresh, with a floral essense that is very unique. Taste is medium to full bodied and very straightforward. Hops. More Hops. Some earth and herbs. More hops. Wow. Very fresh tasting. Mouthfeel was slick and almost oily. Quite different. Drinkability is good. This could be a go to IPA for me. Recommended.

Drys out mouth somewhat, but in a pleasant way.  Delicious overall. Will take the rest of the six pack one at a time so as to be able to enjoy each bottle individually.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,crwills,4.47,"A tasty IPA, although not my favourite.  Pours a pale golden colour with a nice head. Nothing spectacular about the looks, although it certainly isn't pee-coloured like a macro lager either. Smell is string floral hops and grass, with powerful grapefruit notes.  Flavour again is very hoppy, as it should be, although not as strong as some others I've had lately (Scotch-Irish Sgt. Majors and St. Arnold Elissa, both of which I think I liked better). Citrus abounds, as well as some hay. Very crisp flavour, with some soapiness leaking in now and again. Mouthfeel is smooth and snappy, if a bit thinner than I'd like.  Overall, a very good beer, and went well with my spicy lunch. Looking forward to trying some of its 'big brother' IPAs from DFH when I can find them!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,mooseisloose,4.5,"This beer is difficult to find in the Pines area due to high demand but when available it is a treat. I pour this beer into a 12 oz goblet and the head is strong but not over-abundant. The color of the beer is a brilliant copper. The smell is a fresh, sweet well balanced hoppy smell with no lingering after smell. The taste is a pungent malted with a sweet trailer and a finishing aftertaste. The carbonation is enough to spark the beer but not too much to mask the true taste. This beer is not made to be sipped but to be swilled by the mouthful. appearance = 4.0 smell = 4.0 taste = 4.5 mouthfeel = 5.0 drinkability = 5.0",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Pours out a nice orange, a little light, imo, though.Fluffy white head flows up with constant carbonation fueling this cloud. nice lacing too. The smell is hoppy, and quite citrussy too. it is hard for me to smell so much b/c my nose is stuffy, which should affect my taste, but i can taste just fine. Such a natural hop flavor, like it is a hop i bite on. Some cirtus flavor comes out too, lemony. I taste some sort of holiday spice in the aftertaste. nice. Mouthfeel is nice. i've heard it as fuller, as i thought it was average. i hoped for it to be like their 90 minute ipa.  Overall a great beer. i wish i could get this as an usual beer at the store, but as of now i can only have it as a treat. hope this one can come regularly in LA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,pbr85,4.18,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle to a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a golden brown with a small head that remains throughout. The head retention is pretty good.  Smell: Hops are very present. Resiny, piney odors.  Taste: The hops hit you as soon as it enters your mouth. Its a perfect balance: not too bitter and not too sweet. The pine hops are the backbone with a few others on the side, including a slight hint of citrus. Malts are hidden and I couldn't put a finger on it.  Mouthfeel: Great carbonation, smooth feel.  Drinkability: A very drinkable beer. I could definetly have more than a few of these tonight, though it is a little filling.  Notes: One of my favorite beers to have around, it is good anytime and you can drink it with anything. Can't wait to try the 90 minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,clabaugh,4.08,"Appearance: A light copper color, even to suggest honey. This beer beckons with its clarity. Pours a rich head that is white with shades of orange and tan. Abundant lacing that clings to the glass almost interminably.  Smell: A rich hoppy aroma suggesting citrus and spice. A faint malt presence that comes off roasty, but is overwhelmed by hops.  Taste: This beer's best attribute. Much more balance between hops and malt than the smell reflects. The hops, while still pungent, are present in just the right intensity. Citrus flavors emerge throughout: tangerine, perhaps grapefruit. The malts convey a subtle sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Excellent body, light but bold in carbonation. Very smooth and goes down easy, with a pleasantly bitter finish.  Drinkability: I could nurse these all night. DFH puts out a sure winner. In terms of IPAs, this is near the top of my list.  Notes: A great beer to drink with friends; it's the perfect social lubricant. Not too alcoholic, and delicious. I thoroughly enjoy this beer every time I have it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,nlmartin,4.35,Poured from the bottle into a pub glass.  Appearance: This beer has a very golden yellow coloration. The head was about an inch thick creamy off white. Sporadic lacing lingers on the glass.  Smell: Floral spicy goodness with an under tone of malty sweetness.  Taste: This is very nicely spicy hopped beer. The buttery malts play nicely with the hops.  Mouthfeel: I think this one has a very nice buttery mouthfeel over all. A light to meduim bodied all.  Drinkability: This is a very drinkable IPA. I could suck quiet a few of these down on any given day.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Naes,4.06,"This is a golden brown IPA with a huge white head that leaves a lot of lacing. The head retention is quite good as well. Its aroma is of citrus and piney hops. The flavor is just as it smells, some citrus and pine. There is also a mild toasted malt presence throughout the entire drink. Bitterness is there, but not as powerfull as other IPAs. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium bodied and is generously carbonated.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,tastybeer,4.24,"Mmmmm. Suprisingly clear yet it says bottle conditioned right on the bottle too. Head is great at first but lacing and retention fade fast. Aroma is very pleasantly hoppy and refreshing. Grassy, lightly floral, slightly grainy with a hint of peach and pear sweetness. Taste is suprisingly complex. There's a huge assortment of hops and malt flavors with an unfortunte touch of something metallic. Mouthfeel goes well with the taste, and this is also very drinkable.

With that being said...The beer poured a golden color with about an inch of head that had excellent retention. It stayed at least a half inch through 3/4 of the beer. Also had very good lacing throughout the beer. It smelled very fresh, piney and a hint of citrus.  T. Good hop flavor upfront with a grassy citrusy taste, then come the malt. To me a very good balanced beer that finished very crisp.  Lots of body, but light in the mouthfeel category  Really enjoyed my first DFH 60 min. could drink a couple of these in a sitting",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ChainGangGuy,3.23,"*This review will be interjected with the reactions from my non-beer drinking mother. Fire away, Mommers!*  Appearance: Pours a light, golden color topped with a large creamy head. Very, very faint haze. Moderate carbonation. (Mom's voting this one amber and remarked the head was nice and ""fluffy"".)  Smell: Fresh, clean scents of citrus, pine, and grass. Some beers will only give you merely one of these three aromas, but the 60 Minute IPA features ALL THREE. What a deal! There's a subdued malt backing behind it all, but its more like a malt lacking. (Mom says this one smells ""sweet"". I asked her to kindly elaborate, but she ran off to go get the mail.)  Taste: Sharp hop flavors, although none too fierce. A touch of citrus and pepper. There's a secondary toasted malt flavor, but its greatly diminished amidst the hops leaving the brew a bit uneven. Finishes with a long, predominately astringent dryness. (Mom deftly dodges around the question of taste by simply stating this is, ""the best beer you've brought over."")  Mouthfeel: Light-bodied, but nicely accentuated with an invigorating carbonation.  Drinkability: Questionable. Ultimately, I am unmoved by this offering and would rather opt for something a bit more fuller and more rounded in the future.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Schwarzbart,3.08,"Super bright amber orange/honey in color. When poured I got no head but the lacing was relatively sticky. Aroma was oily and of floral hops and bisuity malts. Taste was also of floral hops and the alcohol touches the back of the throat just slightly. Malts had a sourdough bread flavor which didn't seem quite balanced. Mouthfeel was a little course. Not a bad beer, but I'll try the 75, 90 or 120 Minute Ale the next time, maybe they'll be a little more balanced.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Smittysguinness,4.2,"In my efforts to not be so beer-centric and focusing all of my fledgling tastes on Michigan Brewing Company and Bell's, I have found that I really enjoy Dogfish Head Brewery's beers.  With that said, I was really into this beer.  This beer poured into the glass a light, transparent copper, maybe more amber. Small head, about a half-inch or so, white, which left good lacing.  The smell was pine and citrus, not so much floral. The taste, though, was really nicely done. Big hops, as I would expect, and it went from fruity to pine then finished with a grassy taste, leaving the palate clean and crisp with none of tha bitter nail polish aftertaste (not that I go tasting bottles of nail polish for comparison...just a guess). Just had that crisp hops taste in my mouth afterwards.  Plenty of body here, decently carbonated, very light mouthfeel, not heavy or thick.  This is very well-balanced and I could drink many of these in a row, which is quite unlike some IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

D- i personally love the taste of this beer. i would have no problem putting plenty of these back in one sitting  overall- the more i drink this, the more i like it. it has a nice raw hop bite to it, which i love. the taste is crisp and even refreshing. next time im going to side by side this with 90min and see how they stand against eachother. but from memory, i like the taste of the 60min better.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Golden2wenty1,3.98,"Picked up a single at Riley's here in Madison to compare with it's delicious big brother 90.  Pours a light, clear amber with a finger of white fluffy head. Nose is a muted version of 90, piney floral hops balanced by sweet malt and a hint of light fruit. Taste is also subtle, with floral hops, grassy malt, and faint hints of pineapple and apricot. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. This is just a simple, easy-drinking IPA. I could throw back a sixer like water. Then again, I think I'd prefer to throw back a four...-er of 90 Min instead.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,KroMagnon,3.86,"The beer seemed a bit over-carbonated but man, what a pour!! produced a huge rocky head that lasts & lasts and when subsides leaves half its mass on the side of the glass (I didn't mean for that to rhyme, it just worked out that way.) The aroma is OK, its floral like perfume but not particularly citrusy or piney or any of those typically American hop descriptors. The flavor is really nice, well hopped of course with some fruitiness and assertive but not overwhelming bitterness. The malt base is there but not as well blended as some of the other IPAs I've had. The mouthfeel and drinkability are good as well. Very nice beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Low alcohol, but creates a nice warming sense throughout your body. Finish is minimal, which leaves the ability to drink quite a number of these. For my tastes, however, it's a little plain. There just doesn't seem to be much to it. In other words, it's a fine IPA, but not mind blowing.  Check out the 90 minute, especially on tap. That's where it's at.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Nice carbonation and decent head that leaves gobs of lacing along the sides of the glass. Very clear rich golden hinging on copper color. Mostly the aroma is big piny hops, but there are hints of citrus and malt in there. The flavor is a big blast of hoppy harshness up-front followed by a malty sweetness, and finally a dry and mostly clean finish. Lingering remains of hops in the mouth and nose. There is plenty of body to this beer. The drinkability of the 60 is really very good. I can fully understand why this is DFH's flagship beer, even though it lives in the shadow of it's infamous older brother... 90 Minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Small malt notes underneath assertive hops can be smelled.  Sweet caramelly and slighlty syrupy malt, with some buttered berad undertone. Hops are resinous and bitter, slightly overpowering malt as an IPA should leaving a bitter greasy afteraste. A nice malty single IPA, this is bigger and bolder than most American IPAs I've had. MOderatley light body is aided by decent carbonation and the hops to be refreshing even with the boldness.  A good malty session brew IPA, this could become my Winter IPA of choice due to the larger malt profile and not being overly alcoholic.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Very citric and some bitterness on the nose. Some yestiness but mostly just grapefruitey hops.  T - A nice hoppy kick intiitally. Very well balanced by some malts. Overall a balanced flavor led by the hops. Some roasted flavor in there too. Very nice overall  M - Nicely carbonated and very smooth.  D - The website describes it as a ""session IPA"" and I agree.

Huge, pillowy, pitted head. Streams of bubbles line the inside of the glass. Cloudy orange color...bits of yeast throughout. Too carbonated..nearly every DFH brew I've haad has either frothed over as soon as I've opened the bottle, or been 80% foam & 20% beer even after the slowest pour I could possibly muster. Biscuity malts and a unique blend of hops really balance this beer out well. I'm really fond of the unique hop flavor & character of the DFH IPAs, both the 90 & 60 minute. I could pick these out of an IPA lineup in a heartbeat.  The prices for this beer are outrageus in Iowa...usually between 9.49 & 10.99 a sixer. I mean, hell..it's good, but is it THAT good? Of course, I blame the state's laws, but it is one reason why I rarely find myself buying DFH brews around here.  This always has been a very solid and standout IPA.

Smell  Malted barley can be barely detected under the abundance of sprucy, piney hops.  Taste  All hail the hop heads at Dogfish Head. This beer makes me consider the importance of making a pilgrimage to Delaware just to visit this brewery. Of the timed IPAs (the 60, 90, and 120 minute IPA), this one is the most balanced. This tastes like an actual India Pale Ale as opposed to some proprietary malty-hop creation. Very discernable medicinal flavors mingle with the moderately roasted malts. Sprucey hops abound on the endless finish.  Mouthfeel  This has a medium-full mouthfeel; rich and crisp.  Drinkability  Superb. Im all over it. This ones not as easy to find here in Seattle.

It wasn't bad, but not as good as the 90 minute or the 120 minute which is the best of those three.  The brew was lighter than the other two and did not have as much hop or body as the other two.  It was a light copper color with a light tan head. It smelled a bit on the skunk/malt side for an IPA The taste was weak to me, because I was expecting something with a hop bite light their 120 minute IPA.  The mouthfeel was OK and I only ordered one so I'd have to call the drinkablity low.

Also a faint hint of musty, right off the vine grape smell-mostly upon warming. T: A well balanced IPA with dominant citric acid and grapefruit acid throughout. A touch of malt on the finish that gets behind a pungent bitter ending. This beer is bitter from middle to end (in a good way). Sour grapefruit, bitter citrus, and a hint of musty grape (again upon warming) are present. Very well balanced and the pungency level is just right. MF: Medium light and smooth.

T - I repeat, hops and alcohol, this is a very simple IPA, but I think that is why I love it.  M - A little thin on the mouth for an IPA, but the carbonation keeps it exciting.  D - At only 6% and great hops, this quickly turned into a nightly beer for me.  All in all I love DFH, and I love their 60 Minute, I always have a few bottles on hand for when I have a bad night.

Mouthfeel is impressive; almost an oil-like sensation (but in no way unpleasant). This would make a great session beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ClearDog,4.15,Served in an imperial pint glass.  Appearance -- Light amber in color with a thin head that quickly disappeared. Light lacing.  Smell -- floral hops  Taste -- Bitter hops; Faint hints of citrus  Mouthfeel -- Medium with carbonation you can feel  Drinkability -- Quite drinkable. I could easily end up drinking too many on a nice quiet summer Sunday afternoon. I would recommend to any fan of the IPA style.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,burnstar,3.88,Tap at Zeno's. This pours a golden amber with nice big head. Smell is sweet and citrusy. Taste is sweet malt with a hint of peach flavor at first which of course is followed by the hops- lots of nice citrus flavors going on here and a lingering bitterness. More balanced than your average IPA which isn't necessarily good or bad but it's different and I enjoyed it for a change. Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied for an IPA maybe a little bit syrupy. Fairly drinkable. Not as sessionable for me as some other IPA's. This reminds me a lot of Dogfish's 90 Minute which is probably not too surprising. The most striking similarity is in the strong malt presence which I think really suits the more powerful 90 minute but is a little out of place here. Still this is a very tastey and enjoyable brew.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Bonhoeffer,3.93,"Just a good, straightfoward IPA. Aroma ought to have been a touch more up front, IMO. Color is typical, with a bit of cloudiness.  Beautiful hop flavor, with a smidge of malt sweetness. Smooth even with a considerable hop presence. Very drinkable, would be a good session IPA.  Hop burps.  Thumbs up.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,LucaBrasi,3.48,Pours a mid-dark golden color with a huge head that will lessen but doesnt totally disappear. This beer smells hoppy and of citrus reminds me of a southern tier brew that I had about a week ago. The taste is also hoppy with a taste of citrus. The mouthfeel has little carbonation and can be a little oily. A decent beer with a head will stick around thought the session. Give it a try.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,bigbelcher,4,A very nice American IPA. Nice color and flavor. Small head. Not as hoppy as I would like but that is what the 90 minute IPA is for. Very drinkable. The one thing that I really liked about it is that it isn't packed full of cascade hops like a lot of IPA's are. Available in bottle also.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,cracgor,3.99,"Appearance: Clear, light amber color with a white rocky head that sticks well to the glass. Light carbonation.  Smell: A sweet grainy smell. Hops don't stand out that much more than you'd expect. Not really piney, but thats the closest smell I can relate.  Taste: Malty when it first hits the mouth, but as the sense of smell takes over a kick of hops comes in. Not really over the top. But it is a tasty sweet example of an IPA. The hops have a lasting taste I enjoy.  Mouthfeel: medium body, a little oily in texture. I like it. Just barely alcoholic, but in a nice sweet alcohol way.  Drinkability: as far as IPAs go, I enjoy this one. One of the better examples I have had overall.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,scooter231,4.28,"Head, head, head. Big, white, foamy head. Leaves tons of lacing- very inviting. Deep golden color. Smells sweet and floraly, with some earthy hops thrown in the mix, along with lots of citrus- orange, mostly.  Taste is very intriguing for an IPA. Starts malty and sweet, then becomes tangy and citrusy hoppy, then piney, and finally finishes with a solid bitter hops flavor. Lots going on but harmonizes well. I'd hoped for more just solid hoppyness, but the balance is different and enjoyable.  Mouthfeel is a good, foamy, bubbly, chewy texture. Feels really good. Quite drinkable, as I feel most good IPAs are. And at 6%, it's not toooo dangerous so you can down a few. A solid IPA, especially when you're in the mood for a balanced hop taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,KarlHungus,3.11,"Pours a semi-cloudy golden color with a small white head. The aroma is very grassy with faint citrus notes. The taste is as grassy as the aroma with a hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall, this brew is way to grassy for my likings. Grassy can be alright, but this brew is one dimensional and boring.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Hop2it,3.97,"Bright copper with a small amount of head, not much lacing to speak of. On the nose I'm getting some hints of pine and lemon zest. Hoppy and pleasant smelling.  This is one of the more balanced IPAs I've tried. Its body is fuller than its light appearance indicates, going down with a smooth coating on the tongue.  I like IPAs for a lot of the same reasons that I put tabasco sauce on plenty of things that don't normally need it: either I've lost sensation on my tongue, or I'm a sucker for pain. That being said, I like an IPA with spice, one that tickles every part of my mouth and even my throat... for some reason I felt like I needed to justify why I only gave this fine beer an average rating for Mouthfeel.  Overall, because it is so well balanced and not as over-the-top as many American IPAs, I think this is extremely drinkable. If only I could find it on tap anywhere...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,brentk56,4.18,"Appearance: Pours a clear amber with a fluffy white head that dissipates into an archipelago on the surface of the beer; lots of beautiful lacing  Smell: A fair amount to sniff, although the citrus hops predominate; also some cookie malt and a bit of alcohol  Taste: Starts out with a nice cookie malt base, though not too sweet at all; the bitter hops kick in quickly, take over the entire situation and last a very long time  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied and nicely carbonated; this one hits it in this category  Drinkability: A refreshing IPA; nicely balanced",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Celt44,4.42,Appearance - dark amber - maintains a foamy head and lacing remains throughout. Smell - citrus is what come to mind first. Hints of orange and apricot. Strong aroma of pine is also present. Very appealing! Taste of hops is powerful. This one will make fellow hop-heads very happy. Mouthfeel is smooth and not overly carbonated. This is definitely a superior IPA and should defiinitely be considered a session brew for hop lovers.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ommegangpbr,3.95,Not one of the powerhouse IPAs out there but it's one of the most well balanced of the ones I've tried. Smooth and on the sweet side for an IPA. Lots of flavors going on at any given moment (which recent reviews seem to have gone into great depth about so I shan't repeat). Light and classy is what this is. The lightness and the smooth-idity make this very drinkable. This'll definitely sate a hops craving.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,cooter,4.57,"12oz. bottle served in an Ommegang chalice. The 1/2 inch head given immediately dissipated to a persistent film and a generous smattering of large foam bubbles. Smells sweetly of tangerine, flowers, peach, pear?, marijuana, evergreen/pinecone, and just generally a light fruitiness.  First sip is delightful, a mix of traditional piney hops and the ""finer"" side of hops--luxurious fruit flavors. Peach, orange early and grapefruit later, a hint of lemon, sticky and cloying hops, and apple/pearness are all present very clearly and distinctly. I'm not sure I could even imagine a way for this beer to improve in taste; the idea and execution is exceptional. In one sip it's very clean and peachy, in the next it's sticky and piney. But if I swirl it around, the two synthesize and balance without losing themselves. (sorry to wax poetic, but the beer calls for it)  It feels light on the tongue, despite the hop-headed stickiness. Sweetness and fruit flavors (from malt or hops? who knows) keep it tangy and boisterous in the mouth. The style and this contribute to its 4.5/5 mouthfeel score.  Overall, a paragon of craft beer. To think of this beer, then pull it off with such flavor, is fantastic. I want to try the 90 and 120 versions ASAP. If I could improve anything, it would be the foaminess of the head (though it excels at lacing). That's about it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,philipt,4.3,"Of my top three session beers of choice this one definitely ranks one or two (compare with Old Dominion Ales or Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale).  This beer pours copper in color with a respectable vanilla colored head. Little lacing. Very restrained aroma so as not to scare off the unassuming. Rather refreshing, spicy, malty smell. Tastes fantastic. Starts somewhat malty sweet followed quickly by a prickly, spicey hop taste. The brew is very well balanced and highly drinkable. This beer is not a high ABV beer but it's drinkability makes it dangerous.  A truly great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,RedHaze,4.22,"Poured a nice golden color with a two finger head that didn't really last.  Had a good citrusy hop smell, with a little bit of pine to it.  Flavor was citrus, slightly grassy, and sweet. Had some good hoppiness to it without being overwhelming, and some malt in there.  This is a beer that I would have no problem drinking several of at a time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,rxmaster,4.35,"Appearance - golden colored with small, persistant head. thin lace all the way down the glass after drinking.  Smell - Very citrusy, a little grassy and a little pine  Taste - Tastes like it smells with grapefruit, pine and a slight sweetness just before the warming feel at the end. Citrusy taste coats the mouth and lingers long after swallowed  Mouthfeel - Dry and hoppy. Leaves the mouth dry and tingling for the next drink.  Drinkability - Could definitely have a few of these at one sitting. The dryness only adds to the drinkability  IPAs are not my first choice in beer, but this one I will have again",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BEERchitect,4.52,"This is one of the better IPA's ever. It pours typical of all great IPAs: copper to orange, off white dense head, good retention and lacing. Smells better though. Not all piney or grassy, and not too sweet or salty. High levels of IBU's give enough of a spicy, pine cone-ey, estery, and floral aromas to apease the most agressive hophead, but balanced nicely with subtle sweet notes. Tastes smoothly sweet of ripe fruits, citrus, barley sugar, and honey sweetness. Spicy hop flavor compound the sweetness, making it not only balanced, but easily drinkable. Spices show everything from nutmeg and cinnemon to corriander and pepper. Hop flavor brings out fruits of ripe oranges and pears. Finishes crisp and a lingering dryness that is not too harsh. leaves enough hop flavor without feeling hot, grainy, or overly bitter. Aftertaste is spicy and leaving me wanting another. This is even more easily drinkable than their 90 minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Nice peach color, a great creamy head, not very thick, but thin layer of foam stayed on the beer until the glass was empty. Some really thick lace all down the glass. Smell of hops, really floral and almost lite citrus. Very nice hop taste, one of the better IPA I've had in recent months. Some malt and sweeter smells showed up mid glass, but the taste stayed pretty much the same. I would drink many pints of this, if allowed. Great beer. Cheers...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,nickss,4,"Pours a deep orange with almost no head.  Smells of grass, hops, hops, and more hops.  Tastes like it smells... huge and hoppy... lots of zing.  Has alot of bite... very dry.... did I mention hoppy?  All in all... a nice IPA.... I'd take the 90min any day though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,sinistermadman,4.3,Pours a nice golden color while emitting a nicely sized head. Some lacing is left after drinks. Smell is mildy grassy with a nice hop nose. This brew has a medium body that is welcome on the palate. Mouthfeel is oily and the aftertaste sticks around for a while. Bitter hop tinges are coupled well with the malts and mild citrus floral notes. Slightly piney finish. This brew really quenches the thirst. Quite tasty and refreshing. I think I'll have another.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,beermanbrian,4.2,Nice golden/orange color. Small head that dissipates quickly but leaves nice lacing. Medium level of carbonation bubbles. Cirtus smell that is not overpowering but nice. Taste is all hops with citrus and some piney notes. Medium body and nice carbonation level on the tongue. I downed about 6 of these playing poker the other night so it must be a drinkable beer.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,RedwoodGeorge,2.93,"Pours a dark, cloudy orange with a soft, dirty white head. The foam dissipates quickly leaving little lacing along the glass.  Smell is quite promising - lots o' hops. Strong grapefruit rind notes, fresh cut grass and piny resins as well. Not much in the way of sweet malt notes, though...  Taste was disappointing primarily because I had such high expectations so we'll call it an even 'below average'. Lots of strong hop notes - again citrus rind, green wet grass and pine oils. Also a pretty strong spicy note as well. (About the only thing besides the kitchen sink left out was herbal and floral notes). No malt notes that I could detect and worse yet a burnt bitterness that I just couldn't get over. I kept thinking ""bitter, burnt coffee"" but those type of notes you might find in a stout but not an IPA.  Mouthfeel was good enough. Medium bodied, well carbonated with fine bubbles, no real oily residue left on the tongue but still that burnt bitterness lingered as an aftertaste.  All in all, not impressed and not too inclined to try another one. I probably will at some point, hoping this may have been a bum bottle. I'll certainly still want to try the 90 minute to see what kind of similarities there are. If I'm looking for an IPA, though, there are dozens that would be higher up on my list...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Head was a 2 finger size with the pour and is lasting throughout. Nose is basically the malts and not much else. Taste is nicely balanced between the malts and the hops. It almost seems more like an ESB. Mouthfeel is good, very lively on the palate with a full finish.

Some decent hop flavor up front that slowly fades away, and leaves dry. Not as strong as others I've tried. A bit of spicy fruitness going on in the background. The mild carbonation was nice, too.

10099,6108,thinkbreakfast,3.43,"I had a run in with DFH 60 minute IPA at the Peculier (sic) Pub in Greenwich Village last night. I have already reviewed the bottle serving.  App: I found this beer to be at the darker end of the IPA spectrum. The head was fluffy and outlasted its counterparts on my friends' brews (a Long Point Blueberry and some horrid banana thing).  Smell: This IPA has a lot more happening than just hops. The malt is very noticeable in the scent. As a matter of personal taste, I found this rather offsetting. I drink IPAs for the gd hops.  Taste: For the most part, the taste follows the smell. Very malty. Even more so than the bottle version. However, the hops do not let themselves be out done. The result is a pleasant balance, albeit done at maximum volume.  Mouthfeel: Due to the increased malt presence, the mouthfeel is thicker than your standard IPA.  Drinkability: Due to the thickness and extremes in both the malt and hop character, I have to say that this is average at best. Putting away more than a few of these may be difficult. Although it would most definitely be fun.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Pours a two finger light cream-colored head that hangs around. Just a hint of cloudy to the bright and light rust yellow liquid. Aroma is very mild. Grassy citrusy with not very much malt. Taste is somewhat bitter and mildly citrusy. Not a hop monster, it's more of a pale ale than an IPA. Citrus is mild grapefruit with some orange. Fruit esters are apricot and pear. The end holds a cidery piney hop bite. The hoip bitter increased as the beer warmed, but there wasn't an increase in the malt to go with it. Md-light body with mild carbonation that put an acrid sting in the middle of my tongue. Nice burps, though. Co-ho and citrus.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Paid $3.25 for a bottle and was well worth every penny. Pours copper with a perfect head, nice lacing, and great carbonation.

I'm digging the big bread aroma, however.  Big chewey bread. Toasty rustic loaf. Huge bready malt. A hint of residual sweetness too, but overall a completely different malt backbone than I've come to expect from an IPA. Not dry, not caramely, but bready. Wow. I dig it. That said, there isn't the hop aroma, flavor, or bitterness that I had expected. Not that's bad. I suppose this is just another example of the different coast's approaches to IPAs?  Overall, I'd say this is an excellent beer, but I could only give it higher marks if it weren't billed as an IPA. If it were billed as a regular pale ale, I'd rate it near the top. But putting it in the category of an IPA demands a certain hoppiness that just isn't present. That said, this is still an excellent beer, and comes highly recommended.

As I examine the clearity of the brew it looks flawless, my first smell is very hoppy, lemon, citrus, and a floural essence. As this brew hits the palate I taste brown sugar and orange rinds, this is a great session beer one that has alot of flavor and is well crafted. I love DFH and this brew didn't disappoint.

Just a little citrusy along with a strange but pleasant dull odor that I can't quite place.  That dullness tastes a bit like medicine, and it's mixed with the hops for a surprisingly harsh start. More bitter than it smells, but still not all that bitter. Smoothes out in the middle into a sweeter hop and ends on a nice floral note.

Presented to me in a standard pint glass the beer was a dull copper apple juice color. It had about a half finger of white frothy head and it left some slight lacing during the sample, but nothing appreciable.  The smell upfront was citrusy and juicy. Just a slight pine aroma and a good deal of hop in the nose.  The taste was hoppy, but not overly so. In fact, to me, it seemed much less hoppy and much less bitter than many other IPA's on the market. Certainly much less so that the 90 min (obviously) but overall a more mild hop assertivness with just an overall balanced bitter crispness to each sip. Some citrus flavors as well, perhaps a faint lemon or orange taste. Everything very well balanced.  Rather light on the palate and a good deal of carbonation.  Very refreshing and a overall crisp and smooth taste. Not overpoweringly bitter or hoppy and not fruitty either. This might serve well as an intro-beer to the style for someone who has not had an IPA before, or who has not liked other IPA's. Very drinkable, and one I will drink again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell is hop heaven---big piney resinous hops are he first thing you smell, with a little citrus and grapefruit detectable and a bready malt lingering faintly in the background. Taste is more of the same--very strong hops presense with a nice lingering bitterness that is nevertheless nicely balanced by the strong biscuity malts. Beer is medium bodied and has somewhat of a syrupy feel, coating your mouth with pleasant hop oil. Love this beer.

Hop flavour is less resinous, more floral with a bit of citrus. Medium body and carbonation, with a slightly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Pretty good overall.

10099,6108,SupaCelt,4,"Appearance: Hazy and orange. White head with good retention. A messy slather of lacing is left in the wake.  Smell: This brew is one of the most citrus scented brews I have come into contact with. There is an orange peel aroma floating above the glass with lemon and other fresh acidic fruitiness. Not a typical hop nose, this one is quite unique in character.  Taste: Lemon and orange style flavours as evidenced by the smell. A fair amount of bitterness and a nice malt backbone make this a pretty tasty beverage. The fresh squeezed aspect of this drink is the most notable and interesting of all of the characters. This beer has some interestingqualities to be sure.  Mouthfeel: This beer is medium bodied, but juicy enough to feel a bit on the lighter side. Modest carbonation gives it a flatness that contributes to the juice like consistency.  Drinkamability: I could drinkamize these things all night or day. I cannot find anything that would detract from the drinkamability factor. Hops are well represented without crossing the line into crazy hopped territory. Mild and universally appealing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,charlatan,4.24,"This appeared on tap at my local recently. It appeared a little lighter than I would have expected with a reasonable head.  The smell was interesting. A sweet musky (at first I was going to say crotchy, but that would have been unfairly negative), piney, pot ridden, hoppy nose!  The brew was a little syrupy (which I don't mind), but packed a big citrus punch which gradually gave way to a slightly more acrid flavour. Considering this beer isn't from the NW, I'm suprised to say it is one of the most citrusy IPA's I've drunk. I like it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,silver0rlead,4.1,"Pours a bright, clear copper color with a foamy white head that dissapates quickly, a nice lookin IPA. Smell is floral and citric hops with a dominating grapefruit smell that goes nicely with a bready malt background. The taste is fairly complex, you get a grapefruit hops flavor, a piney, resiny taste coating the mouth and a soft biscuity malt flavor that takes a backseat to the hops. The finish is crisp and creamy with a mild bitteress that belies the alcohol. Overall a nice IPA thats hoppy but not overly bitter. A drinkable and complex IPA, nicely done.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,JackStraw22,4.42,"Appearance: Slightly hazy golden/amber, with some bright white head. Retention was ok.  Smell: Obviously a good deal of hops hit the nose, some toasty/bready malt aroma. Some yeasty smell too.  Taste/mouthfeel: YUM! For a well hopped IPA, this is beautifully balanced. Not overwhelmingly bitter, but a lot of hop flavor that feeds off the malt. Body feels a little thin, slightly dry.  Drinkability: One of the more drinkable IPAs I've had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Medium body with ample carbonation. Spicy, herbal flavors from the hops are strong. Long citric finish. Malts present only in the fullness on the palate.  The smell of this brew ruined it for me.

Appearance-Pours a muddy orange hue reminicent of an early evening sunset, pours an even white head with lacing clinging to the sides of the glass nicely.  Smell-An overload of hops followed by citrus and earthy tones, a true IPA in every sense, a great balance of sweetness wraps it all together.  Taste-A sweet IPA with a heavy dose of hops balanced nicely by the maltiness. There seems to be several layers to this beer (as mentioned above that) contribute to the boldness and complexity of this IPA.  Mouthfeel-A mild carbonation along with a surprising smoothness that lends itself nicely to this beer  Drinkability-I definately would recommend this beer as a great session beer, a great balance of powerfull hops and smooth drinkability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell: This beer smells like bomb-ass super-skunk stick-icky-icky expensive kind bud! It smells like really good pot! SOMEBODY PLEASE BEER MAIL AND TELL ME THAT I'M RIGHT ON THIS ONE, PLEASE. I swear to God, as a former stoner, I can attest this beer smells like good weed. The earthy, grassy, leafy hop scent really gives off a marijuana smell. It's like a fresh zip-lock filled with an 1/8 of the good nugz.  Taste: This is a damn good IPA, one that all other IPA's can be judged against. The earthy, sweet citric, grassy, piney hop taste is so complex. Some IPAs just have that bitter hop kick...this 60 minute is just so well rounded.

This beer looks wonderful in the glass. The aroma is of very strong citrus and floral hops. The initial taste is an overpowering hop flavor. Its not overly bitter.There is malt flavor backing, but it is definitely in the background. This is the kind of beer that hopheads love. This is a good beer to pair with a meal.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,HappyHourHero,4.07,Fairly strong pungent grapefruit hop aroma. Thick dense off-white head fades quickly to a thick film leaving some thick strings of lace. Hazy dark straw colored beer shows little carbonation. Solid malt backbone with some chewy citrus hops riding on top. Finish is just bitter enough to let you know it's an IPA.

Pours a golden orange with a 2 finger, off white head that leaves some lacing. Aroma is grapefruit, pine, pineapple/mango, malt breadiness, and yeast - the tropical hops dominate. There are lots of grapefruit/pine hop flavors along with pineapple, yeast, a touch of breadiness, and a big malt backbone. It is both sweet and fairly bitter at the same time. The mouthfeel is full, smooth, and coats the mouth very well. It's fairly obvious that this is the little brother of the 90 Minute, but that is by no means an insult. Overall, a damn fine IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BruceBeerman,4.27,"Nice orange golden color. Nice lacy head when poured out of bottle into glass. But what amazed me was the smell. Very hopped, but not overpowering. The smell adds to the actual taste. Nice bitterness and slight aftertaste. There is an initial floral taste and then a completely different bitter aftertaste. Nice complexity yet very drinkable. I consider this not a session beer, but instead an after dinner beer. A real treat!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Pours translucent orange-amber with a very foamy head, good retention. Robust carbonation. Smells of wheats and a nice mix of hops, some alcohol notes. Taste is very well balanced with toasty bready wheats and a full hops flavor that was not just bitter but had actual hops flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp as well.

10099,6108,GClarkage,4.11,"04/20/05- Received via trade with connecticuitpoet and steinlifter.  Presentation- 12 oz bottle with a bottled in December 2004 notch on the label. Poured into my Stone IPA glass (is that blasphomy)  Appearance- One of the best pours I have ever seen. Glorious golden orange color, an inch fat blinding white head which 1/4 inch hangs out throughout. Thick chunks of lacing cling onto the inside of my glass for dear life.  Smell- More hop sweetness than I have smelled in an IPA. A bunch of sweet floral, fruity and piney scents all rolled into one.  Taste- A bit swayed towards the hophead here. Mostly all ultra sweet, (almost sickening sweet, especailly for an straight IPA) hops and the malt is wayyyy overshadowed by hops.  Mouthfeel- Moderate to low carbonation, leaves a sticky coating on the roof of my mouth.  Drinkability- No way I could do this a session beer, but it's a great IPA for a change of pace if you want a really sweet IPA. Almost like a Pliny the Younger with less malt and 1/2 the alcohol. Thanks guys for the sample!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BuckSpin,4.09,"Poured an interesting rolling cascade of warm gold/pale amber in color with a 1/2"" head of clingy white lacey foam. Nose was wonderful - spiced, hopped, slightly sweet with a very noticable citrus of grapefruit.  Initial tongue was smooth, with the citrus present, and very even. This began a pleasing, slow slide into a surprisingly mild hopped on a easy bed of malt. Although at proper temperature, it had a odd ""warm"" sensation to the mouth.  This was an enjoyable, mild IPA, and one I would recommend.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Not much head to speak of, great lacing though.  The taste was well balanced but just not hoppy enough for me. I guess I wanted something really hoppy and this just didnt do it for me. Id rather stick to the 90 minute.  Finishes real crisp and and the one hand it finishes real nice and smooth.

10099,6108,FirstMan,4.42,"Dogfish Head knows how to do IPA. Don't try to argue with that.  This is a brisk, light, hop-infused delight to be enjoyed on a warm sunny day (or a cold dark day when you want to be reminded of a warm sunny day).  Pours a light golden amber with just a little haze. A head of tiny bubbles laces away to form a little archipelago on top.  A very floral hop aroma leads into a crisp bitterness when it hits the tongue. Very refreshing. The mouthfeel is slightly slick and smooth with a little dryness.  Overall a great IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Zraly,4.15,"A nice hazy, light orange elixir slithers down my pint glass. A somewhat typical looking ale, with modest head retention.  Aroma of bread and herbs, reminding me much of some fancy bread mix you'd buy at a gourmet shop.  Wonderful and pleasant, this IPA goes down smooth with its malty sweetness and its citric twang. Clean and crisp. Flavors are tight and the malt is slightly muted to present the refreshing quality of the hops. The finish leaves a wonderful tingle, letting you know ""the hops were here"". But, its done with wonderful balance against the slight, yeasty sweetness. Real easy drinking, even for a non-hop head like myself. I know I cannot have just one of these! And I won't!  Pizza of any kind with a white sauce goes real well with this selection. Try with even a mildly spicy food, perhaps some tuna tacos.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smells of citric hops, mostly grapefruit. While the hops dominate the aroma, there is some malt underneath.  Tastes very hoppy upfront and in the finish, but there's a brief pause in the middle where the malts barely peak through. Not exactly a smooth transition. Its like the ball is fumbled and then quickly picked up.  Good medium mouthfeel that meets my expectations of the style. Despite its slight awkwardness, I would have a few more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Taste is like smell light biscuit malt light fruit flavor taste like pear mixed with some grapefruit leaves a light lingering bitterness. Might have some light pine in finish but not much. Mouthfeel is light side of medium more on the light side really., it is crisp and refreshing make a good summer IPA when thirst quinching is in order.

Citrus and a little pine.  Taste: Again hops are strong, but not too strong. And its balanced by a nice malty sweetness that comes out a bit toward the average-length finish. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, sort-of-creamy-sort-of-oily texture thats nice and smooth, a good amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Highly sessionable for an IPA, because it has enough character to keep your tastebuds interested without frying them.

Then even some white flowers, and camomile. At the taste, again a good hop, definitely good: again the grape-fruit/pepper notes. And the beer itself it is good, malty, and after all well balanced. Medium body, good texture, good presence in the mouth. Hops in the aftertaste too, obviously, with a peppry and citric background. Although it is hop-oriented, it is still well balanced.

This one pours...holy crap, the head on this thing is outta this world! Deep coppery color with a ginormous head. Smells of pine, cloves and...honey? The head lingers like meringue.  Taste: this beer is mostly hops (not surprisingly), but with a discernible maltiness in the background. However, I am kind of dumbfounded to find that I like this beer. It has a very alluring spiciness that goes down extremely well. I will be the first to admit I am not a hophead (I prefer my bitterness to come from roasted malt).

10099,6108,pentathlete,4.02,"Pours a beautiful clear orange-gold with 1/2 inch head that falls to about 1/8 inch leaving blobs of bubbles on my official DFH pint glass. If they made a hop-based soda pop it would smell like this. The odor could easily be confused with sweaty socks too. I bought a case of this in December and drank two sixers in the first week and I remember this beer being rough and raw like chewing hops right off the vine. I've had it cellaring for the last couple of months and opened a bottle tonight. The taste has definitely mellowed. (Or maybe I'm remembering the Burton Baton from last night.) The initial taste is mellow malt, then a alcohol coated hoppiness takes over without destroying the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium to light with the bubbles feeling a bit too big with the alcohol bite. This is easy to drink, certainly more so than three months ago. I'll be trying it again in May to see if it mellows a bit more. I've got track down a 120 and see what I'm missing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,GolgiIPAratus,4.29,"Sampled: 2.27.05  12 oz. bottle - bottled 11.04  A medium pour into a slightly inward tapered pint glass produced a hazy orange liquid with a full one inch head of beaten egg white. This lasted a pretty good length of time while I admired the appearance. As it slowly withdrew, tendrils of lacing etched the inside glass. The body held evidence of sediment from the bottle conditioning in suspension until gradually it came to rest at the bottom. Other bottles I've had in the past have had much more of these flecks, but this one was on the light side.  A nose-full of this brew is more complex on each sniff. At first it's overwhelmingly sweet and citrusy. Then, the hop aroma slaps your olfactory. Deeper still there's whiffs of mango skins and raw carrots. Hm, strange, sure, but I swear it. And even further into the vortex, yeast-like shots of baked breads.  Simple this beer is not. A mouthful yields even deeper intricacies. An IPA's necessary hop inclusion is just the tip of the iceberg. A bitter tongue blast is soothed by a sweet flowery bath. Could these be orange blossoms? Swirling it around the mouth made me think so. A tart snap lashes upon swallowing, like a ripe red plum angry it's been picked. The balanced bitterness hangs out at the back of the tongue for a while after each sip. The beer was well carbonated and sat light in the mouth.  If you're into the bitter, this could be a session beer. Most of the time a six will last a few nights of marveling. That is, if you can hold off on that third. It's almost too good not to, but at the price of about $7.99, I personally feel I get greater value by enjoying them slower. I would assume, too, that buying them in their native Delaware is cheaper, though.  This is a damn fine brew. I've been familiar with this one for a while, but really examining it for this review, I was impressed even more. All IPA lovers should celebrate this beer if at all possible.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Beer is a deep orange color but still very clear and a light champagne carbonation  S- smell is lots of floral/piney hops possibly a fleeting hint of malt but its hard to pull out  T- this beer leads with a resin piney hop taste and then comes more of the bitterness with a bit of alcohol warmth at the finish. A little toasted malt flavor is a secondary hop enhancer  M- light mouthfeel with a bit of carbonation fizz at the end. No astringency or tartness  D- a good hop monster. I know there are bigger hop monsters but this is all hops with malt and alcohol only present to enhance the hops even more.

Smell: Malty, with plenty of herbal hop aroma.  Taste: This is a fairly thin-bodied brew, and the carbonation seems a little much. It has a nice malty taste in the middle, but it's dominated by strong, orange-tasting hops. This is certainly a hoppy beer, but the hops aren't that intense or asskicking. This is still very drinkable.  Verdict: This the hoppiest beer I've tried so far, which isn't surprising considering that I spend more time drinking oatmeal stouts and brown ales than I do drinking IPAs.

10099,6108,Dubblebock,4.18,"We waited a long time to get the Dogfish Head brand here in Texas. It was always tough for me to read the reviews and hear people rave about these beers here on BA and not be able to get my hands on any of the beers themselves. But lo and behold, DFH now has a foothold in Texas, and it was well worth the wait.  The 60 Minute IPA is a beautiful introduction to the DFH brands. This is a well-crafted and very drinkable beer, and it's a great reflection of the IPA style.  It pours well, with a cloudy orange/amber tint. Not an overwhelming head on the pour, and what head did develop didn't stay around long. The beer still looked very nice sitting in the mug, though.  The smell was good. Hints of citrus and hop.  The taste was divine. This isn't a hop-bomb in any sense, although the hops come through loud and clear up-front. Nicely balanced and incredibly smooth. Nice citrus background, grapefruit and orange peel. The malts even things out nicely, leaving the drinker with a relaxed warmth.  Good mouthfeel, not overly carbonated. No hint of the 6% ABV to get in the way of the taste. Not heavy in any sense, just light on the palate. Very refreshing.  Very, very drinkable. I could easily make this my favorite spring/summer session brew.  This is a really good offering from DFH. I can see why this is basically their flagship beer. This will be great in the warmer weather. Keep this one in a glass, though. I tried one out of the bottle, and the hops just overpowered the taste. You have to let this beer breathe in a glass or mug to get the real experience. Thanks for braving the Texas market, guys!

Taste: A caramel malt starts this beer off, and it transitions to a strong pine (and somewhat earthy) hop finish.  Mouthfeel: A thin, almost watery beer that doesn't spend much time in the mouth.  Overall, I enjoyed this beer, though the mouthfeel left much to be desired. I think it tastes great, I like an IPA that has a bold hop flavor to it.

Served in a non-chilled (by request only) standard pint glass. A full finger and a half of white head...lace was incredible...covered the glass and did not move one bit. An attractive honey brown color w/ a faintly sweet aroma. Taste was a bit unbalanced...almost no malt detected to counter the hops. A hop bite of citrus/grapefruit flavor that ended in a bitter finish...not much of an aftertaste. The mouthfeel was ok...I prefer their 90 Minute.

The small amount of effervescence left still leaves great rings of lace. The nose is gently sweet and malty wit ha slight background of hop and alcohol.  The flavor is smooth and easy. A very rich fruit taste at the front with an earthy hop hit in the after. Halfway down the glass, the hop flavors kick up quite a bit.

10099,6108,neonbrown82,4.43,"I was surprised to see this stocked at my local grocers. I had been seeking some DFH for quite some time now, but now I need look no further than the grocery store. Unfortunately, the 60 minute is the only IPA available from the series, but there were two Pale Ales that I also look forward to trying from DFH.  Onto this beer... it poured to a golden color with a slight amber hue and a healthy foam top that lasts through the whole glass. The smell is probably the least interesting of its qualities, revealing a nice hoppy bouqet, but it doesn't immediately jump out as you draw your nose to the beer.  The taste was interesting. Perhaps maybe a hop strain I am unfamilier with or something. VERY piney. The first few drinks I was not impressed, but after that I got that same piney and citrusy taste that I am used to from an IPA (and it was quite delicious I might add). The mouthfeel was awesome. I could swish this around for quite some time, letting the flavors build to new complexities before sending it down the gullet.  While some would consider 6% high for a session brew, I would have to say that I would consider this a good session IPA. The hops are not too overpowering, but rather just enough to draw you in for more. The alcohol is only present on the finish, but not overbearing. If it weren't for the hop burps, I would have been chugging these.  (edit: usually tastes like cinnamon and hops to me, but the last time I bought it, tasted like a roasted cider with a bit of hops.)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,RoyalT,4.03,"Appearance  This one is a deep but brilliant orange in color with a thick, creamy, retentive head that is slowly lacing the hell out of my Cottonwood glass.  Smell  This nose has a full, huge biscuity character making it a strong East Coast IPA. Its almost nutty its so big. The hops are big and fruity.  Taste  The malts here are gigantic and flavored with Macadamia nuts. The biscuit is like raw biscuit dough. Its almost tangy and very yeasty, not in a Hefe Weizen way but more like yeast in warm water after its foamed but before its mixed with dough. The hops are classic East Coast with lots of non-acidic grapefruit and a strong citrus balance.  Mouthfeel  This one is on the big side of medium-bodied with some good carbonation but little drying on the tongue. Its creamy in the mouth like peanut butter.  Drinkability  This is very different than other IPAs that Ive had. It doesnt follow the pattern of DFHs other IPAs, thats for sure. It is very smooth though and went down quite well.  Update  I originally reviewed this with an 05 sample so thought Id revisit it with a 2006 vintage.

10099,6108,dansteino,4.23,"Appearance: Very good. Bright, glowing orange with a beautiful, rocky, foamy, bottle-conditioned head.  Smell: Good. Piny, floral hops predominates.  Taste: Very good. Lots of hops and a good amount of malt. Pretty well-balanced for such a hoppy beer.  Mouthfeel: Good. Full and rich.  Drinkability: Good. Session beer for hop head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,karst,4.57,"A session beer for the hop head. This fine IPA pours absolutely crystal clear a modest head forms atop the rich straw color and leaves a lace that persists on the side of my pint glass. A fruity hop aroma that reminds me of the last time I put my head into a bag of freash whole hops. Hops, hops, and more hops. A great taste with enough malt to support the esters, this IPA has a great mouthfeel with a near perfect CO2 level. I can't believe I only bought one bottle. Next run I will make it six! Ummm . . no maybe twelve!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,whartontallboy,4.12,"Pours a deep orange with quite a bit of white head that stuck around for quite a while. Fair amounts of lacing. The smell of this beer is amazing; it's dominated by hops with some floral notes, but nothing ridiculously overstated. Taste is similarly hoppy, with some grassy and piny notes in there as well. I detected some alchol in the finish coupled with some bitterness. Mouthfeel is relatively dry and medium-bodied, but with a bit of bite from the hops. Drinkability - Nice enough, but nothing to write home about.  Overall: A very nice IPA that avoids a lot of the overwhelmingly fruity notes that sometimes annoy me, but by no means a new favorite. I've got 7 more from their sampler pack in my fridge, and I'm looking forward to drinking them.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,GreenWBush,4.45,"A campus-area dive bar just got a keg of this, and i've been drinking the hell out of it. It's been beating the hell out of me, too.  This is actually darker orange in the pitcher than in the glass. Lace sticking everywhere like a mofo, even with the crap-tastic plastic cups.  The nose of this beer is undeniable heaven, even for people that aren't hop-junkies. The taste is fabulous, and once you're on your third or fourth pint the insane hoppiness degrades and you're loving on the super-sweet gumball malt.  A Caveat Emptor: If you're drinking this beer heavily, be prepared for a punch much more than the 6% ABV would lead you to believe.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,HardTarget,4.12,"12 oz brown bottle notched 12 (sampled 1) with 6% abv listed. Aroma: Like sticking your nose into a freshly opened bag of hops. Cant pick a particular type, seems like a blend, probably with Columbus and Cascade. Appearance: Bright clear yellow amber glass with a modest cover of white that laces and tides. The head fades to a collar about halfway through but the lace is forever. Flavor: Nice floral, peppery and citric hop notes with just enough malt to back them. Hops are at an IPA intensity and just popping fresh. There is a slight sweet twist at the back end but it quickly is buried in the hop aftertaste. As I grew accustomed to the hop intensity, the malt back came through a bit more with a spiced, grass-like note in it. Mouthfeel: Creamy medium body with a light oiliness that lets the hop flavors linger. Overall Impression: For the hop level, I found it very refreshing and enjoyable. Drinkability is put off slightly by the intensity and heft, but this is a beer I will seek on a regular basis now that it has made a home here in Texas. Intense taste of hops without the pucker or burn; Sam and crew have done it again with a fine off the hook beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell: This has the most beautiful smell. Very floral and citrus hops permiate the area once this beer is opened.  Taste: There is some malt that shows itself at the begining. There is some great hop flavor. There is not much bitterness but the aroma and flavor make this beer very good.  Mouthfeel: Nice and rich. Not too thick though. There is a good amount of carbonation in here.  Overall a great beer. There is some great flavor and aroma.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell: Light lemon and orange zest notes. Nothing else but bitter hop-like notes.  Taste: A hop blast first...grapefruit juice, bitter orange, and a slightly sweet granny smith-like apple finish. The malt is definitely more up front than in their 90 minute IPA.  Mouthfeel: medium to thin bodied, creamy, complex, and dry.  Drinkability: Hops are in high gear here. It suffers just a touch due to the hop bitterness. It worked for me though.

10099,6108,PossumJenkins,3.82,"Wow! I had heard good things about this beer, but I was still surprised at how good it was. Appearance - nice golden brown, typical IPA color, 1"" straw-colored head that lasts a good while and leaves lacing all around the glass. Smell - very good. Citrusy, maybe a hint of pine? Taste - ah, the pine really comes through here. After the first sip, I thought, ""man, this is like drinking a Christmas tree,"" but that description doesn't really do the beer justice. The piney taste is definitely there, but it's not overpowering by any means. It gives a unique character to the beer that is great in my book. Mouthfeel - good, but nothing special. Drinkability is pretty high, though the pineyness might be a turnoff for some. Overall I rate this beer very highly - it certainly won't be my last.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BeerAngel,4.37,"This beer pours very clear with a pale tea-like color with a nice fluffy off-white head. The smell of fresh cut grass and hay and the punch of hops will make your mouth water! The taste reveals a nice malt backbone translating into a nice lightly sweetened biscuity base blending nicely with the pungent hop bite and bitterness. It has a medium bodied mouthfeel and finishes just slightly dry. Very, very nice!  Notes: This is my idea of a very well crafted IPA. It's not overboard with the hops, but you definitely know they are there. Beautifully done!  Note #2: This beer's label states bottle-conditioned. The bottom of my bottle had absolutely NO yeast ring or sediment to be seen. I don't think it's bottle conditioned.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,allengarvin,4.51,"Appearance: Clear copper-amber color, good white head and nice lacing.  Aroma: Huge, absolutely unique hop aroma: peppery, earthy, even pine-like aroma, reminiscent of toasted bread (not the bread-like malt scent). This is one of the best IPA's I've ever smelled.  Flavor: Burst of hop flavor, which seems to remind me of pepper and oregano, and pine needles, and dried lemongrass. Bitterness is high, but this beer is more about hop flavor than stingingly high bitterness. A solid malt base gives balance and body to the beer. Finish is dryish, but not astringent.  Body: Medium-full body, medium carbonation.  Quite fine IPA. I like this lots better than the 90 minute, and infinitely more than the 120 minute.

The smell of this beer is very nice, with a strong grapefruit and pine aroma. The smell of this beer is very fine for an IPA and makes you want the first sip. The first sip has a nice piney and mild citrus taste. I am a little dissappointed in the strength of the hop flavor in the beer. It has a nice taste in the beginning but does not hold up very well. The mouthfeel is also a bit on the thin side. The beer did have a nice hoppy finish. This is a very drinkable session beer..",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Pours a clear, slightly orange gold under a one finger off-white head that settles quickly to patchy film but leaves very nice lacing. There's definite pine in the nose, but it is not overwhelming, and is accompanied by a hint of sweet bread. The mouth is quite well carbonated and fairly light-bodied. There's a definite malt presence as the taste experience opens, sweet and almost fruity. This is balanced by a raw pine bitterness that is pervasive but not excessive. The pine is a bit harsh, perhaps slightly unfinished. The raw, almost espresso bitter is dry, inviting another swig. This is a great introductory IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell: Plenty of citrus in this one, grapefruit stands out. Also a hint of nutmeg and pine.  Taste: Damn tasty IPA. The time I had a 60 minute, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. I love IPA's but this one took me few to come around. Now its a staple in my fridge. Smooth with plenty of hop bitterness to please.  Drinkability: A very drinkable IPA in my opinion.

Clean bitter finish with a burst of flavors detected on the back of the tongue.  IPA beers are not my favorite, but I thoroughly enjoyed this IPA from Dogfish Head Craft Brewery. I will definitely keep this one around.  Prosit!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The smell is an offering of citrus blend and spicy hop notes. It has a beautiful body, not too heavy ass like some high hopped beers are but it acheives balance without needing extra body. The taste is of a perfect hop splash. The moderate alcohol content is slightly noticeable and the plate of malt flavor serves the hop bitterness up well to liven up your mouth.

Unique among the East Coast IPAs, and among the best session IPAs. Oily-slick mouthfeel with a hop bite that doesnt hold back, without overkill on the ubiquitous grapefruitmaybe its the Mystery Hop X.

Citrus & pine jump right out of the glass in a most impressive way. Some interesting fruit plays around in there as well.  Biscuity malt, & fruity flavours, quickly give way to a full on hop assault.

10099,6108,farHillsBrewer,4.62,"This beer answers the question: Can A beer have too much hops? The answer is a solid NO. From the moment I popped the cap and smelled the hops, I knew this was to be a memorable brew. The color is a bit light for an IPA, but the head is substantial and leaves little islands of hops inside the glass. There is some sweetness on the tip of the tongue, but this ale is ale about the hops. The hop-flavoring due to the constant addition of hops throughout the boil is awesome. Hops coat the tongue from beginning to end, and leave a balanced bitterness that lasts long after the swallow. I heartily recommend you treat yourself to a least a 6.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smooth and tangy, Dogfish Head tastes like nothing else I've had. This is a nicely balanced brew. Not as overtly fruity or hoppy as some, but plenty of hops are there to balance the malt undertones. I would like to compare the 90 minute head to head to see the difference, but this has a good shot at becoming my #1 session IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,trumick,4.4,"Pours a light amber color with a white thin head and nice lacing all around.  Scent is superb, sweet carmel malts, nice pine, citrus with grassy notes.  Taste: amazing, the perfect balance between the sweet malts upfront that linger just long enough, and then the explosion of hop flavors to follow. The malts are still there though, ever so slight. The finish is citrus, pine hop with just a hint of the malts still present. A bit O sweetness aint too bad.  Mouthfeel: almost creamy, it is sooo smooth. Light bodied and perefct carbination.

There really isn't anything else that stands out in the hops because they are so overwhelming. Not a bad thing. There is a hint of citrus coming through but not much. The taste is pretty much hops all the way through. The flavor is pretty consistent on the palate front to back. It has a nice mouthfeel. Good carbanation. It leaves a pleasant hop flavor in your mouth. Medium body. IIt's a fairly drinkable beer depending on your hop preferance. If your a hop-head you could drink a few of these no problem. If not, you probably aren't going to even think of picking up a sixer of this. I think it's a great beer. I definately would recommend it.

10099,6108,Shiredave,4.29,"60 Minute pours a sparkling golden amber, with a dense, bright white cap. Sticky lace trails in erratic smears and chunks on the glass , leaving little floating on the beer. The aroma is sharp and floral- a victory garden and freshly squeezed OJ - sugary malt is in the background, but not un-noticed. Intensly hoppy but somhow balanced aromas invites the alpha acid lover in for more. Flavors of soft doughy malt up front fade and blend into amazing and complex hop flavors on all levels. The aroma plays a big role in the flavor of this beer as you can pick out and match the aromas and flavors that flood your senses. Very mellow, medium mouth feel support the hop dominance and while slightly on the thin side, provides exceptional balance and drinkability. Bitterness throughout and in the finish are less than I expected and allows the lingering hop flavors to be enjoyed instead of being over powered as in many more heavily bittered IPA's. Outstanding example of the style, with a Dogfish Head twist. A great beer for those looking to really tastes hop flavors.  *Revised 4-7-21 - still good but not great any more to me. It has lost it's mid boil hop flavor profile and has more back end bittering.

10099,6108,bultrey,4.59,"This has been on draft via Randall the Enamel Animal for quite some time now at Bling Tiger, and I have to say, it has been my ""finishing"" beer on more than one occaison. There should probably be a separate category for this when it is served via Randall, because the fresh hops really makes a difference that can't be duplicated any other way. The appearance is dark golden honey, with an average head and nice, sticky lacing. This beer smells phenomenal -- especially if you're a hop head. This must be what it's like to take a bath in hop oil-infused water. When you drink this puppy, the hops are omnipresent, but I don't find them to be completely overwhelming like so many other attempts at strong IPAs. The plentiful malt backbone really stands up to its acidic foe and takes it like a man. I taste pinenuts, orange doughnut, rosemary, and a very floral profile. I appreciate good IPAs, but I am not a hophead. As such, the long, lingering bitterness that haunts you after many over-the-top IPAs is not appealing to me.

All I could taste were the hops, and I didnt find them pleasant. Very similar flavor profile to a SNPA, which I dont care for either. If you it, you will like this one too. Other than the taste, this beer was fine. Its not a bad taste, it just doesnt sit well with me. I traded a Stone IPA for the DFH and I lost in the deal.

Smells citrusy, lots of hops, lots of pizazz. Taste is very hoppy as expected. So many hops that it tastes bitter, which I think is what DFH might have been going for and is what makes this beer more unique than the average IPA. Mouthfeel; this tastes like a dry wine or something of the sort, almost feel like I need a glass of water after this one. Very interesting indeed.

Hops so strong and powerful without being over the top. Malts are floating on top of the hops like the surf on a wild ocean, only way I know how to put it. Really a beer that can easily stand on it's own. Big presence, big smell and taste. Hay, grass, citrus and subdued and weak banana/pear. Very good lingering aftertaste dominated again by the hops.

This one leaves a very nice lace on the glass especially for a bottled beer.  Smell is honey and malty and clean --almost ocean-like maybe a bit salty.  The taste is strong hops with some berries, fruit and malt. This one is hoppier than the Shelter pale ale they make and I still like this one better. It just tastes fresher. The mouthfeel is dry and salty but excellent.  Drinakbility is the one weakness. I am just not that much of a hop-head although Dogfish head is one of the better hoppy tasting beers readily available to me.

Resinous cannabis (Columbus hops?) smells come strong, with whiffs of fir sap and citrus peel. Since I've evolved into a hop head, I've come to love smells like this.  The taste is, as expected, very hop-oriented. Starts off with a flash of sugary malt, letting you know this actually was brewed using some barley. The resinous hops come in strong and stay strong into the citrus-bitter finish. I picked up some lingering patches of sweet malt as well. A nice IPA, although the hop taste was on the verge of being only two-dimensional.  Mouthfeel is sticky, medium-large bodied. I would drink this more often if it was available in either MN, or UT!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,diamonddave,4.12,"Pours dark amber with a big ol' puffy head. This'll get your mouth watering before you even smell it...  ...and when you do, DANG. I hate to use a fey adjective like ""pretty"" to describe a beer, but this smells awfully pretty. If a girl's hair smelled like this, you'd fall in love with her instantly. The hops are evident in the nose, but it mostly smells flowery and citrusy. You'll want to spend a little time here before taking a sip.  And when you do, again, wow. Mucho hops, but balanced nicely with a malty/fruity finish.  Mouthfeel: I'll say the same thing that Linda Lovelace probably said about John Holmes- very thick and satisfying in the mouth.  This has such a strong and distinctive taste that I think you'd burn out on it if you drank more than a few at a sitting. But gaw-damn, this is a great beer. One of my absolute favorite IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Huge fresh citrusy grapefruit hop aroma !! Nice hoppy taste without being too bitter -- decent balance for the amount of hops involved... Medium bodied and smooth with a pleasant bitter finish.  OK OK Maybe now I see why this one is so highly regarded now that I have had the draft version ... Much much better than the bottled version !!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,mudhoney,4.45,"Sam Caligione is a genius when it comes to IPA's and hops Although this beer isn't a monster IPA, it is by far one of the better ones offered in this area after a much anticipated arrival. Served ""Randallized"" this beers appearance is a burnt- orange color topped with very a small amount of creamy white head that quickly disappeared. The aromas are citrusy and sweet. The floral aroma of the hops kicks in as you put the glass to your lips. (oh my the hops). Cascade and Amarillo hops make a fine marriage in this beer and are not overpowering even with the randall hopping process applied. The flavors are carmel and apricot followed by a dry bite of hops. The finish is hoppy and dry without a lingering oily taste. I was very impressed with the ""Randall"" and this beer, and look forward to trying it bottled as soon as I can find some and pick it up.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,assurbanipaul,4.46,"Before I start, let me preface this by stating this draft sample was served through a newly-installed Randall, so this may differ from the bottled or standard-draft version. Will compare/contrast when I have the chance.  Pours a clear, orange amber, light with a thin to nonexistant head. Wonderful, bright, bright fresh hops aroma right on top; floral, herbal, fresh-cut grass but not enough to be off-putting.  Taste is rather thin and light for the style but with the same fresh, herbal taste present in the aroma. I expected a palate-raping experience from the effect of the Randall but instead its effect was subtle, more in the aroma than in the taste. Pale malt, gentile hops, very drinkable. Finish is back-of-throat dry.  Light mouthfeel, flavors the breath with hops. Immediate massive hops burps even with a small sample. Easily quaffable, the effect of the Randall is obvious and appreciated. A welcome departure from some of the overwhelming West Coast hop monsters.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

This is quite different than the higher octane versions, but it does restore my faith in DFH ales that aren't trying to be different ( the seemingly normal Shelter Pale Ale is a disaster)  Appearance: A bright copper color with abundant carbonation and a lacy white foam head of about an inch. Classic.  Smell: A very strong scent of hops with some citrus.  Taste: A very good IPA in my book. This had a dry malt base that stood up well to the hopfest that is this beer. Hops hops and more hops give a fruity, piney, flavorful taste and an alluring crispness in the finish. Not as sweet as some other IPAs, but not as bitter either. A nice middle ground IPA with distinguished hop flavor.  Mouthfeel: Decent, the amount of carbonation gives this a lively feel, not overdone.  Drinkability: Good. I could have a couple and still not have my pallete shot to pieces. Nice middle of the road ABV, and a solid all around beer from one of my favorite breweries.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The first sip is all hops and damn is it good. Not too bitter and it even leaves a nice aftertaste. This is one of the first proper American IPA's I've tried and I like it alot. I'm a big fan of the hops and this brew definetly delivers. I'm excited to try the 90 and 120 minute versions after all I've read on here.

10099,6108,TongoRad,4.07,"Pours a light copper color with a thick and long lasting slightly amber head.  Aroma is all about the hops, very fresh- slightly citrusy, slightly resiny- like a powerful perfume. Theres also a hint of caramel.  Full bodied with plenty of residual sugar and caramel to support all those hops, and the perfect touch of bitterness.  This beer is extremely well put together though I would hesitate to classify it as a session beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,HopGoblin,4.2,"Pours deep, golden-orange with a nice two finger head. Nose is filled with hints of sweet hops and malt. The nose is a little deceiving when it comes to the hops, because the first taste is filled with that great hop flavor. As the beer began to warm caramel and citrus flavors filled the glass. The beer had a long, nicely bitter finish with strong flavors of grapefruits. An excellent beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,kmpitz2,4.54,"The beer pours a briliant hazy golden color with two fingers of head that stick around after the initial pour, which is nice to see. The sweet hop in the nose is just beautiful. It is grapefruit and floral that makes me want to just sit and smell the beer. I can't wait to try this beer. A bit of a let down in my book. The hop in the nose is not given justice by the hop in the flavor. The flavor has a nice grapefruit sweetness from the hop and malt, but there is just a bit of weakness in the bitters. I want them to stay on my tongue longer than they do. The beer is moderate to thick in my mouth with a moderate carbonation that just nicely dances on my tongue. As IPA's go, this one is very drinkable, but I would like the bitter to stay on my tongue more and make me pause a bit between sips to clear that feeling. Overall, this is a good offering. I would pick it up again, but I am also looking forward to trying the 90 minure again after not having it in 3 years. I think that will be more to my liking.  Edit: I think the flavor is not as weak as I thought last time I had it. I think the flavor renders this one very drinkable. The bitter hits hard upfront, but then fades, but doesn't completely die. This is a fine beer",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,SCW,3.71,"Don't believe the hype? I first tasted this beer a few years ago and reviewed it under my old profile. I find myself tasting it again and approaching it at another angle.   With so many hoppy beers on the market these days, the east coast breweries have not asserted themselves with their IBUs the way west coast brewers have.  As a result, I found this beer to be not as balanced! That right, I think their 90 minute IPA is actually more balanced than the 60. There's too much malt and not enough hops in the 60.  Overall, the taste is good... no oxidation, no dms, low to no diacytel. I do think the body of the beer is a little heavy to go with the current hop levels...  I give it slightly lower scores for the appearance because the bottle says it is bottle conditioned. Quick question... where's the yeast? Is this false advertising? I bought a six-pack and the first two bottles have absolutely no yeast in them. The beers are perfectly clear and I swirled the remaining 1/6th of the beer and added it to my glass. Nothing. What's up with that?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Nothing like the 90 & 120 minute IPAs Dogfish has, this is a 'normal' IPA that is loaded with hops - hopheads line up for this one. $2.00 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,FormatKid,4.68,"Oh yeah, been waiting to try this one forever. Packaging is a twelve oz bottle with a cool, minimalist design. Packaged on date on the side indicates this one is pretty fresh.  Pours out into a classic vision of the style. TONS of carbonation bubbles roll up and form an ample, sticky looking, big-bubbled off white head. The body is a murky tangerine-orange color and continues to be very active with lots of carbonation through-out. Head-retention is nice, and keeps a nice cap of foam on the brew most of the way through.  The smelljuicy with fruity-hop aromas but there is a swelling of sweet malts there to accompany it very nicely. The hops come to me mainly as juicy citrus and apricot aromasvery inviting.  Well, if the hops were a bit subdued in the aroma, they make their big show in the taste. Although a nice sweet, sticky wave of malt dominates the front it is completely taken over by a beautiful fresh hop flavor. Im almost getting a candy-sweet flavor in the middle, and a hint of yeasty nuttiness where the malts merge with the hops across my palate, its lovely. Its spicy through-out and especially in the finish. Obligatory big citrus hop flavors in the finish as well. I cant taste the alcohol in this one at all but I can feel it ever so slightly in my belly. The mouthfeel is medium, and hints at sticky at points...which in this instance, is a good thing.  I really, really enjoy this IPA, it did not let me down one bit and I had high hopes for it. Big and hoppy, but with subtle nuances as well. Now, cant wait to try the other IPAs from DFH.

Flavors are just overall juicy hops with sweet smoothness that lead to a great feel and exceptional drinkability. Extra smooth and hoppy.

Smell was pretty typical IPA hoppy with strong citrus doiminating and a hint of pine and alcohol underneath.  Taste was good. Nicely hoppy and dry, but there was a sharpness to the finish that I just didn't care for.  very good, but not one of the all time greats.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,crookedhalo,4.19,"Draught pours a clear golden copper color with a pretty short-lived light beige head. Medium to lower carbonation. There's a depth in the hop aroma that encompasses a grassy, botanical type aroma as well as some good, crystally homegrown. (Sorry for the non-beer suggestion, but hops are a genus cousin to marijuana, and the recognition is purely objective) Malt profile's a bit biscuity and sweet, but the dryness of the hop counterbalance this. It's wonderfully carfted, and a refreshing change of pace as opposed to other U.S. brewed IPAs. Unique hop profile that makes it wholly enjoyable in the American IPA style, it stands out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Sharp hop aroma is joined by black pepper and leather with a hint of chocolate coming in late. The crisp bitter hop initial taste remains strong to the finish. Chocolate blends in at mid-taste and strengthens toward the end. Zesty, herby hops and a bit of spearmint also emerge in mid-taste along with hints of oak and soil that fade in and out. Medim-thick body with very good carbonation and a good balance with a heavy bias to hops as per style. A very drinkable beer. Bitter, but in a pleasing way.

10099,6108,dmbfrat420beers,4.92,"Presentation - 12 oz. bottle that proclaims ""the continually-hopped, bottle-conditioned India Pale Ale""  Appearence - Hazy orangish-amber hue with medium white head. Frothy lace hangs to the glass as you drink.  Aroma - Smacks of citrusy hops  Mouthfeel - light carbonation bite, slightly slick medium bodied feel.  Taste - slight malty sweetness that blends well behind a powerful citrusy hop precense - I always burp hops afterwards. Turns rather bitter (in a good way, IMO) at the end and leaves a bitter, clean taste that fills the back of your throat, mouth, and lips. I should add that there is something distinctly DFH about the hops in this IPA which I think sets it apart from all others - a sort of deeper, fruity/earthy taste that is unique to the DFH line. I can't adequately describe it, but try for yourself to see.  Drinkability - Unless you are averse to hops and a bit of bitterness, then the moderate alcohol and medium body make this a great session beer which goes down easily.  Final Words: From my description, this may seem kind of bland, but I promise you that this a great tasting brew. The first sip of every bottle immediately relaxes my whole body and mind. I think that it sets itself apart from other APA's and A-IPA's because of its full flavor and great balance. Not as intense as its 90- and 120-min cousins (or other bigger IPA's, for that matter) but an extremely well balanced, very hoppy, exceedingly enjoyable beer. I have to say that this is one of my all time favorites from my favorite style, and it's THE beer that got me into 'good' beer. Lacks the creativity of other DFH offerings, but is otherwise a pinnacle of microbrewery success.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,oxmasterscream,4.42,"Appearance: I poured this beer at the same rate I'd pour any beer into a glass but this beer behaved differently... so differently that there was almost an accident. The head built so quickly that before I knew it, I had only poured a third of the bottle and the head was at the top of the glass. Many BAs describe the size of the head with their fingers - In this case, it would've made more sense to measure the size of the beer, which appeared to be a side-effect of the head. The creamy, beige head was five fingers easy and very dense. It barely broke down but as it did, it began to look and feel like egg whites when they reach the ""stiff peaks"" stage. It was so bizarre. Its texture also resembled the top of a rootbeer float a bit too. The small amount of beer in the glass was a cloudy light amber color.  Smell and taste: As expected, this beer announced its all-hop bouquet right off the bat and with force. A blast of citrus, huge tangerine, some orange and grapefruit with a background aroma of grass and hay. Sometimes, I detected a slightly skunky characteristic (maybe from the yeast in the bottle?) in my nose and mouth. As I chewed through the mountainous head to get to the beer, things at first, tasted citrusy and spicy, maybe a little peppery. Towards the end of the taste, an ever-so-slight bitter tang was left on my tongue that begged me to drink more. As I finished the bottle and the beer had a chance to warm, other flavors began to expose themselves - mellow caramel malts, a sulfur taste I experienced more than a couple of times and oddly enough, something berry-like grabbed me right before I finished the entire beer (this confused me).  Mouthfeel and drinkability: It's medium-bodied and very carbonated (hence the massive head I suppose). The slightly higher ABV is barely noticeable. Nonetheless, this is a complex and exciting beer; It's captivating, like a great beer should be, and entirely drinkable. Had I had another I would've poured it immediately. It was so much fun to drink.  Note: This beer really surprised me. I'm not normally a hop-head, but for this beer, I found myself becoming one. This is a really unique beer and everyone should try it at least once. In fact, it left two other beers I tried later on the same night, tasting completely bland, and these were malty, bigger beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,putnam,3.8,"I understand why this beer exists. I really do. And it is well crafted, with a fantastic looking pour, complete with fluffy, sticky mousse and deep amber color. But it's not ""beer"" nearly as much as it is hop infusion. And they are good hops, ambling the complete range from stern, pig iron bitterness to the most delicate, resiny mint aromatics. Pine, lemon, grapefruit, pot and sap are the only flavors in this ""beer"" and whatever malt component is there is strictly contributing body - not flavor. And as for yeast? Forget it. Any nuance of peppery, zesty fruit is obliterated by the hop extracts. The yeast contributed alcohol - nothing more.  Perhaps it's a love-it-or-hate-it beer. Then this must be a wishy-washy review. But I can't get away from the very negative answers to several of my usual quality questions: How much imagination did this require? How classic is it - how many generations of beer drinkers have endorsed it? Is it complex? Is there drama? Does it change as it is consumed? Is the last drink better than the first?  I'm afraid in years to come we will look back on this recipe as a caricature, a fad. It is a good demonstration of one important beer ingredient - but not ""beer"" itself; no more than pepper is steak au poivre nor more than pepperoni is pizza.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Small champagne bubbles rise from the bottom to renew the head, which settles pleasantly as a lace. The nose is amazing on this beer. Its like putting your face in a pile of hops. Rich floral/grass/pine aromas rise from the glass. Just a hint of grapefruit too. The taste is an explosion of hop taste. A tongue awakening of flower, pine, and grapefruit, a mild sweetness comes from the malt. This has a very slick mouth feel, and seems very drinkable.

The flavored hops are mostly floral in taste. Malt seems a bit weak to me, there could definitely be some more malt here. The finish is very dry except for a pine needle hop flavor that lingers.

I have got to say this is one of my favorite American IPAs. The flavor is more intense than any light bodied IPA I have ever had. A very good session beer, but at 6% ABV be careful.

At 6% abv it has a kick after a few. Nice all around flavor though not a very over powering aftertaste. I realy like that feirce hop bight and this beer was lacking it.

Better than the bottle.  Pours a light golden amber color with a small head, about one finger. The Belgian lace is all over the glass in a beautiful pattern. The aroma was somewhat piney from the abundance of hops. The taste is like pine and mint, reminds me of a good gin. I like the extra hops, but this one, the hops are blended perfectly as not to overwhelm the drinker.  Damn fine beer and my favorite IPA.

10099,6108,Beersignal,4,"Poured a deep amber, slightly hazy with a generous sand coloured head of medium hold and better-than-average cling. A fine rise of smallish CO2 bubbles vigorously made their way to the cap of foam to feed it. Pleasing to the eyes.  The aromas: What can one say but saturation of hops. Fresh resiny, peppery hops dominate the aromas and leave but little room for the faint notes of citrus and orchard fruits that rose up as the beer gained in temperature. There is some complexity but you have to work at getting there... more reward in the end.  In the pie hole it goes: Powerful hops and then a balancing malt followed by soft caramel mingling with a rather passive lemon/lime combo. A long and oily bitterness lingers on the palate for what seems like years. As the beer warms, the malt makes another more remarkable appearance and lends the beer some complexity and harmony.  Another powerful offering from Dogfishead (I think they have shares in american hops companies).

10099,6108,andyo,4.77,"My wife and I both had a pint of this beer on a lazy summer afternoon at The Taphouse Grill in Norfolk (Ghent). Originally we were going to have Racer5, but they were all out. On a whim I asked the bartender if they had anything on cask, and whenI found out they had Dogfish 60, I couldn't resist! By the way, this is my first experience with cask conditioned beers.  Poured a hazy (very hazy) orange/yellow color with a frothy white head. Nice lacing the whole way down.  This beer gave off a grassy, faint aroma. Nothing overwhelming here. (this is a good thing, to me). I think I spent a few minutes actually just looking at this beer. It looked extremely beautiful.  First sip: WOW. This beer was served somewhat warm (Im guessing this is how cask beer is served), and this only intensified what I was tasting out of this beer. I was initially expecting a huge hop presence, as I have been drinking fairly hoppy IPA's as of late. Not the case here. Everything was balanced exceptionally. Nice creamy malts, and sweet hops came through...lemon, but not overbearing, some faint grapefruit flavors, a little bit of grass, tapering off with a very, very buttery finish. Lasting flavors are sustained in the back of the tongue and throat. This beer just stays on the palate, long after each sip. The mouthfeel of this beer was incredible!  This beer was a masterpiece. It seems like this beer has benifited a lot from the cask conditioning. It just seemed so very round and mellow. I've enjoyed 60 minute from the bottle before, and I think it is a stellar brew anyways, but the cask version is simply amazing.  I will definately be seeking this beer out again.

The taste mostly revolves around the hoppyness of the brew but you can notice enough of a malt flavor. The flavors scream hop compared to everything else going on, not the hoppiest IPA (AIPA) out there but is a fantastic representation. This is simply a very good beer and one that I am happy to have finally tried. Will be looking for this one again and hope to try it on tap soon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Smell: Floral, citric hops and bready malt.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Citric, herbal hops coupled with a mild biscuity malt. The finish is very dry and hoppy.  Overall: An all-around good American IPA. Recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,NEhophead,4.27,"A glowing, ""light"" orange appearance. Almost a rust-like look. Bright white 1"" head that kept it's retention longer than expected. Very nice, spider-web like lacing.  Strong hop aroma, packed with a citrus, grapefruit nose.  The taste of this American I.P.A. is like biting into an exotic, island fruit. Extremely juicy tasting; had me looking for pulp in my glass. Nice hints of floral aromatics in the aftertaste.  For a hophead the strength of the hops and the flavors that they provide is heavenly, but not overpowering. Newbie's beware: if you're not use to a really flavorful I.P.A., this may scare you away from the style.  Very palatable! Crisp and not heavy at all. Wonderfully refreshing especially on a warm summer afternoon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,rastaman,4,"I guess there was no surprises that this was very hoppy, hugey piney/lychee/citrus characters. Malts aren't as evident as the hops...no surprises. Malts were nutty, lightly sticky. Lovely full flavour, rich, intense and with a dry bitter finish. Really well made and really tasty. classy, well made.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,malty,4.59,"Poured from a 12 oz. brown long neck w/ a 'packed in' month notched-out.  The first pour yielded a nice clear orange color w/ lots of fine bubbles racing upward creating a 1/2 inch or so white head that had staying power.  The hops shot-out with their fresh and leafy splendor - almost minty. Fresh, Fresh, Fresh glorious hops!  Beautiful balance of whole, crisp hops flavor backed by a just enough doughy malt to even things out. The hop character stands firm, without being too bitter-dry. Not the hoppiest of IPA's, but definitely one of the most balanced and refined. Outstanding freshness (again)!  Mouthfeel is silky, soft, creamy and a touch oily. Carbonation is fine and quite active which gives it's medium body livliness.  I could honesty drink more than my share of this fine ale. It doesn't build on the tastebuds and become astringent like a lot of heafty IPA's out there.  Overall an outstanding IPA. With this category becoming saturated and somewhat predictable through the years, Dogfish finds a way to keep this ale unique and interesting. One of my favorite US hand crafted (bottled) IPA's to date.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Jacobier10,4.2,"Pours out a cloudy orange color with a small head. One of the more cloudy IPA's I've seen yet. I could smell the beer as I was pouring it and expected a huge aroma, but when I put my nose up to it, it was suprisingly subtle. Very citrusy aroma, with a hint of fruit (some orange, peach, and grapefruit were present). Real smooth tasting. Slightly bitter, but well-balanced and not overpowering. This beer goes down very easily for a decently-strong IPA. Definitely recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,proc,4.2,"Another very solid IPA (I love this style of beer).  This one pours out to a dark gold to almost light orange in the glass with a decent head and lively carbonation. The aroma is straight grapefruit. The taste is where this one shines, with the hops hitting your tastebuds hard but giving way to a residual sweetness of the malt that compliments rather than fights the hop bitterness.  A session IPA easy. Its nice to see Dogfish Head products now available in Michigan.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,connecticutpoet,3.97,"This is an interesting beer. Based upon what I had read about it, I thought the hop aroma would be more prominent, but it wasn't. It reminded me more of citrus and a touch of cinnamon, with a light hop background. As it breathed, however, the hops became more pronounced.  The head was light and creamy, and left nice lace rings around the glass as I drank it. The bitterness came to the fore upon sipping, in a very good way. It was a nice, hoppy flavor, and yet quite smooth. A very good beer, and one I would have no problem drinking again. Good for sitting around the house and snacking on nachos or bagel bites.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Lafe,4.02,"Pours a nice golden color, with a tight, white head on top. The aroma of this beer promises hops, and that promise is kept.  The flavor is strongly of hops, with just enough malt backbone to keep you from puckering up. The bitterness gets up in your face and says hello in a clean-finishing sort of way.  I typically prefer a larger malt backbone on an IPA, but the bitterness is so clean on this beer that I don't really miss it. It's refreshing. It'd easily go well with a snack or a pizza, and one could knock a few of these back with unconscious ease. It satisfies the hop craving without getting in the way. Every once in a while, while drinking it, you stop and think, ""This is a good beer.""",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,rajendra82,4.1,"Pale golden orange color, cloudy unfiltered body, creamy durable head, in other words the picture of a quality IPA stamped all over the pint glass. The aroma is bit fainter than most other IPA style beers, with the hops exhibiting a mellow soft character rather than an up front pine resin like aggressiveness. The taste is very bitter, bone dry, tart, and lemony, and backed by the pale and caramel malts displaying a faint butterscotch flavor. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, with a creamy effervescence. This is quite easy to drink. Thanks Foxman for the treat.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,meathookjones,3.97,60 Minute IPA pours a golden orange color with a nice fluffy white head that remained through most of the experience. Hops dominate the aroma with a backing of hints of citrus. Good hop flavor hits you first along with notes of pine and citric flavors. A bitter and fruity aftertaste follows the initial rush of hops. This has a medium creamy mouthfeel that fits the brew well. A good all around IPA that is very flavorfull and makes for a good sessionable brew that can still give a hophead his fix.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,LarryV,3.32,"Pours a very clear, dark golden color. Smell is dominated by hops pungency. Somehow, I think DFH has changed the brewing process for this beer. I've been drinking it for quite some time, and the older batches had a hazy, opaque look with a fairly moderate mouthfeel. The new batches appear to be very filtered, and the mouthfeel is rather thin now. The hops seem to be a bit unbalanced as there's not much of a malt backbone to back up the hops. It's still a decent beer, but the thinner mouthfeel really takes away from the experience. I've been disappointed with the last couple of cases I've had.  Update 29-Dec-2005  I swear this beer tastes different everytime I try it. Seems much less hoppy now and a bit maltier and sweeter. This used to be my session beer, but I can barely drink 2 in a row now. Something has definitely changed in this beer from when it was first introduced. Maybe it's DFH's attempts to make this beer more balanced as that seems to be a common complaint - I can definitely smell more malt in the nose as well. The brash, bratty hoppiness that this beer used to have is what made it so appealing to me. Now it's as if the hop monster within has been tamed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,PopeJonPaul,3.98,"Poured a deep luminous orange with a Sta-Puf head and a strong, sweet, kind of weedy floral aroma. Bitter yet surprisingly balanced hop and orange peel flavor with a nice crisp tongue-thickening mouthfeel and a good hoppy finish. Wasn't sure what to expect after the 90 and 120, definintely surprised by the drinkability, this stuff will own real estate in my fridge this summer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ColForbin,4.17,"Pours a dark golden color with a thin white head that fades to about half a finger. Some flecks of yeast that settle to the bottom of the glass. Nose is full of spicy, piney hops, with some slight citrusy aromas as well. Taste is spicy and hoppy, with a malty/bitter finish - if I didn't know better I would say there was some wheat malt in this, since I get a little bit of tartness as well. Nice balance - am I really saying this about a Dogfish beer? A somewhat light mouthfeel, with a good amount of carbonation. Very drinkable - an excellent session brew or as an accompaniment to food.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,mschofield,4.45,"Pours a clear dark-orange gold (flecked with floating particles when the yeast is swirled and added), topped with a two finger ivory head, well carbonated. The head was ""well built"" and did not diminish at all throughout the drink, left thick bits of lace. Very hoppy aroma, citrus, herbal, wood tannins. Citrus, wood, caramel taste, the hops take center stage but the do not overwhelm the beer. Not as bitter as all that hop aroma and taste led me to expect.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,nvsblman,4.17,"Appearance: Amber colored, about 1 finger of head that reduced to about 1/4"" and stuck around for a bit. There was light lacing that lasted through the first several drinks.  Smell: Pleasant fresh citrusy aroma.  Taste: Great hops flavor, I got noticed the pine flavor was a bit more intense than some other IPAs I've had, but not in a bad way at all. Aftertaste was a little citrusy.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium mouthfeel, just a hint of creaminess.  Drinkability: This would be a great beer to kick back with a few on a hot Arizona summer day.  All in all a great, fresh tasting beer. Thanks to PSUDREW for the trade!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ngandhi,4.1,"Grassy, musty, lightly citric, hop-driven nose with very subtle hints of barnyard and fennel seed. The grassy quality to this beer is fresh and quenching. Wonderfully balanced hops with a tinge of grain. Light bittering on the palate forces this beer into limbo between pale ale and IPA for the seasoned drinker, but perhaps a defining example of the style for those new to IPA. Great citric fruit on the aftertaste.  Relax, relax. ng",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,scriabin,3.81,"Very nice IPA. Head is on the thin side, but it has a nice cloudy, unfiltered appearance, more like a wheat bear. Taste is sweet, hoppy, and a little bitter with some very subtle coffee flavors. A nice, complex IPA that has a new surprise on each sip. I could definitely drink a few of these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,kegerator,4.2,"This is the first Dogfish brew I have had that I truly did not enjoy. Poured out a true amber color with a decent fizzy head(had to force pour a bit). smell was not pleasing at all, very hoppy, grassy, piney. the taste was quite the same as the smell and left a bitter aftertaste that was not so pleasing to me, mouthfeel was nice for as strong as the flavors are it was pretty smooth in the mouth. I bought a 6 and felt like i had to choke it down a bit at first. I should say as I drank the last two(i did not drink the whole 6 in one night) it seemd i had aquired a taste because the more of these i drank the more it didn't offend me. This one is a world away from the 90 minute. Ok, so i bought more of this and get what everyone is speakign about. I must have had old bottles. the newer fresh 6er was creamy smooth, great mouthfeel and the hop flavors came through very nicely, and were very clean crisp and refreshing to say the least. my rating numbers will reflect this",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,RockyTopHeel,4.37,"Glowing, yet darker than some other IPA's, like a golden-amber dying ember in the fire.  Aroma of flowery hops. Flavor is somewhat muted compared to some other IPA's like Stone, but what it loses in intensity is made up for by increased drinkability.  I like this beer. If you're looking for a very sessionable IPA that still has good hop flavors and aroma, this could be your beer. Good stuff.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,benmiliron,4.07,"Paid $1.60 for a 12 oz single.  Heavy floral hop aroma. Overly dominating hops. Wow. Great beer if you're a hop head. Not quite the malt balance I'd like to see though. DFH saves that for 90 minute. Acidity can be a bit harsh.  A good session beer though, and highly recommended if you're a hophead.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,garthwaite,4.49,"Pours a cloudy deep gold with minimal head. Wow - has a truly delicious citrusy hops aroma. Smelled this one about 8 times & complimented it twice. Absurdly fresh hop flavors everywhere. I'm loving it. Some acidity, all kinds of citrus. A full rich flavor with a nice dry bitter finish. A damn tasty IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Hefe,4.52,"Tasted from 12 oz. bottle on 4/27/04  Appearance: Beautiful golden/amber colour with a light haze due to the yeasties. The is bright white and lasting.  Smell: A veritable pimp-slap of complex hoppy tones. Citrus and pine, with undercurrents of grass and floral aromas. Propped up nicely with touch of biscuit and malt.  Taste: Hoppy flowers right up front, that slips into a pale malt sweetness and then into an oily grassy/piney dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Excellent! Creamy, with a slightly oily feel, yet still a crisp, almost tart finish.  Drinkability: Absolutely!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BuckeyeNation,4.05,"Rich golden amber with the barest suggestion of orange when viewed through bright sunlight; lighter than most IPAs. It's also perfectly clear on the first pour, but those yeasties that I see in the bottom of the bottle should cloud things up nicely on the next pour.  The head is off-white, big and frothy. It falls to a thick disk and leaves a chunky collar and small sheets of lace. The nose is nicely hoppy, primarily the citrus and evergreen variety, but with an underlying assertive, spicy quality as well.  It's pretty aggressively hopped, but the bittering seems out of proportion (i.e. greater) than the actual hop flavor. It's not bad, mind you, though with this degree of tongue-tweaking bitterness, I would expect the hop taste to be fairly exploding across my tongue. There's bitter grapefruit and orange peel, along with plenty of pine sap (the dominant flavor) that lasts into and through the long finish.  There's also a more than solid, sweet, cake-like malt backbone providing support for the hop attack. The body is medium-full with a mouth-coating, almost syrupy quality. I can't wait to try the 90 Minute and the 120 Minute, they must be 'huge' and 'more than huge' regarding body/mouthfeel.  60 Minute IPA is a much better beer than my first DFH offering (Immort Ale), but that has a lot to do with my fondness for IPAs and for hops in general. This beer has a unique flavor and stakes out territory different than many other IPAs, but doesn't quite rise to the level of some of my favorites. Still though, it's enjoyable and I really am looking forward to trying its bigger brothers. Thanks to mikeys01 for the bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Bierguy5,3.88,"Pours a light bronze clear liquid with a white foamy head. The head stayed for a little while. There is a good amount of lace on the glass. Smells slightly fruity and woodsy. Sweet beginning with a good amount of bitterness. Finish is somewhat fruity, but not very citrusy. Medium body, and carbonation seems appropriate. This is a pretty good IPA that I could easily enjoy several of at a sitting. Pretty solid!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,CRJMellor,4,"Pours a golden amber with light effervescence and a minor bright white head with tones of lace on the pint. Aroma of caramel malt, pine needles, some citrus and grass and herbal hop notes. Flavors detected were a touch of caramel, pale malt and a citrus and pine-like hop bittering. Mouthfeel was light and ""champageny"" upfront with a spciy middle and a dry bitter finish. Drinkability is very good. No nearly as good as it big brother, 90 minute, but still a hop heads delight and a quality brew from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,bditty187,4.01,"Slightly hazy, coppery-bronze hue with peachy/gold highlights, there is a modest amount of animation streaming upward to a white head that reached a finger in height. The retention was excellent; it slid to a foamy mess after a long moment. The subsequent lacing was rampant and very sticky. This is a lovely looking beer. The nose is hoppy like an IPA should be, the aromas are not forceful however and I like that. The hops seem to impart a mixture of good cheese and pine needles, spruce with a distant but bright note of citrus. Underneath the hops is a dull maltiness. I like the bouquet and find it inviting. However the potency is modest. On the palate the hops come across very oily, in a good way, lots of rinds and little in the way of flesh of grapefruit, there is a dry leafiness at the finish, spruce, pine needles, and more aged cheese (like Gouda?). The malt is noticeable just not very flavorful, hints of dry cookie/cracker notes with a touch of caramel. I absolutely love the arid finish, plus it has great length. Medium in body with a natural, caressing carbonation, the mouthfeel is very good and it seems a bit fuller that it really is, that is a nice touch. I bought a six-pack of this nectar in Fort Collins and I have loved every bottle Ive quaffed. Both DFH 60 & 90 Minute IPAs are fantastic beverages (120 IPA not so good) and I wish I could drink this one anytime I wanted. It is a shame I cant. This is well worthy trying, recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,GreenCard,4.17,"Appearance: light copper, slight haze, thin layer of white foam  Aroma: pine, passion fruit, grapefruit, grass, malty caramel  Flavor: resinous hop flavor (pine and grapefruit rind), a light level of balancing malt sweetness, finishes dry with a lingering hoppy/caramelly aftertaste  Mouthfeel: medium body, minerally, astringent, soft carbonation  Overall Impression: This is the first and only of the XX-minute IPAs from DFH that I've tried. It's a luscious one. Great as an aperitif to get the tastebuds going. Though it has a hearty amount of hoppiness, it's not so much that you can't drink a few of them.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,AbePhroman,3.92,"I had tried the 90 minute before this and was very impressed so I bought a 6 of this. Although I enjoyed the 90 minute more, this is a well crafted brew. A hazy gold hue with hops scent present. Very nice aroma. This is a very drinkable IPA, not too bitter and the malts are just as present in the taste as the hops. If you prefer a little more bitter brew, try the 90 minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Mitchster,3.95,"Pours to a milky dark peach, with some scant bits of yeast flittering about, forming a rocky light beige head with meringue-like consistency. Very good retention and sticky lace, akin to great swiss cheese. Carbonation is mild-moderate. Aroma is very good....green floral and citric hops with orange blossom honey, husky pale and crystal malts, very mild yet pleasant skunky marijuanna, a hint of oxidized hop leaf, catnip and grass...all in all, a very nice start. Mouthfeel is piquant with a dry finish and medium-dense body. Taste begins with biting pinous flavor hops, a fairly intense bitterness level, a mild level of skunk, dank hay, grain husk, and a lingering note of marijuanna and hop resin. Alcohol is imperceptable. The finish is hoppily astringent.  This is an excellent IPA, but I could stand to have a lower bitterness to help the malts come to the forefront. It's quite unique in it's grain and hop choices. Still, I yearn for the infinitly more drinkable Two-Hearted as I drink this. Solid stuff.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,merlin48,4.45,"Pours a hazy, amber body, with a longlasting, two finger, beige head. Lacing effect is beautiful, with sheets and patches all over the glass. Aroma is typical of many DFH's, with a mysterious honeydew melon drenched in honey note, followed by a fullblown assault of citrus and pine hops. Mouthfeel is creamy and fullbodied. Pine hops coat the mouth and bite the tongue. Pine hops keep coating the palate, as citrus flavors arrive midway through. Excellent malt flavors complicate the taste buds. Seems like there is elderberry wine and honey in the background. Finishes with a green apple tartness, and leaves a clean, fresh, citrus hops aftertaste. Very unique in flavor and aroma, in typical DFH style. I could survive for months with a few cases of the different DFH IPA's. This one is most drinkable, with its modest abv.

Full body, lots of carbonation. Strong hops presence but is balanced out by malts. Pine flavors up front move to a citrus flavor with some spiciness. Finishes with a dry bitterness.

10099,6108,hustlemuscle,4.38,"This stuff kicks my hoppy ass. Pours a nice golden out of the minimalist labeled bottle, with a decent head and good lace. The smell is oddly refreshing, with a good hoppy tang to it. And once it gets in your mouth it is even better. Hoppy and malty in near equal portions, it ends with a citrus tang. Smooth and easy to drink, the high carbonation giving it a pleasing tickle. This is my second of the night, and it saddens me that there are only 4 left in my sixer.

10099,6108,Loki,4.57,"Sampled on draft at Brixx in Greensboro, NC (Thank god somebody is putting something different on tap!)  Appearance: A golden honey orange color with a nice frothy head. Sticky lacing all around the glass.  Smell: A blast of citrus, lemongrass, and floral hops swim quickly past the slower and smaller malt scents that have trouble fighting the current. A very floral balance that resembles a fresh herbal tea more than a bitter IPA, then hints of bitterness and subtle notes of malt reveal the true nature of this fish.  Taste: Wonderful balance of malt and hops. Slightly bitter, but the hops add more fruity esters, citrus, and wild flower flavors than bitterness. The malt starts sticky sweet then slides to a dry, slightly doughy finish with a hint of nut and dry yeast.  Mouthfeel: Starts stickly sweet but quickly runs the gambit of citrus to floral to slightly bitter to a dry clean finish with a pleasant aftertaste. Very satistfying.  Drinkability: All day and all night. This beer practically begs to be paired with food, while possessing the character to stand clearly on it's own. One of my favorite IPA's to date.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

My fist experience with it wasn't all that pleasant, maybe I got a below average batch, but tried it again at the pub and damn, what a phenominal IPA! Ridiculously drinkable. Appearance: Straw gold with a hint of ochre, with a ton of particles floating all around making it quite hazy. (Not sure if this is yeast or what.) Ample carbonation that gave a good head, and great lacing. Don't remember it being so hazy when I had it on tap. Smell: Oily hop aroma, but more subdued than I had expected. The hops smell really fresh. Mouthfeel: Nice rich mouthfeel, that tickles the tongue. Taste: Initial piney taste gives way to subtle orange rind bitterness,with simultaneous hop flavor and bitterness carrying through to the end. Extremely refreshing.

The aroma of citrus and hops were present even before I had it in my hands. Took a drink and then another because I couldn't believe how good this is. Slight grapefruit and pine, hard hitting hops then a nice mellow caramel. Very tasty experience. The mouthfeel was slick and silky but fluffy enough to leave gracefully in time for another drink.

10099,6108,CBFanWish,4,"Dogfish Head could very well be ranked among the greatest craft breweries in the nation, but, with exception of the leagendary 90 minute and 120 minute, they have never remained consistant from batch to batch. This isn't always a bad thing, but It could be better. 60 minute IPA is one of the few beers they make that remains consistant almost every time. Its hazy orange amber colour and frothy white head is a standard that every brewer should try to achieve. Rich and beautiful. The smell of flowers rise from the glass like a spring garden, lush and full of life. The taste is of oranges and lemons with subtle hints of bitterness. It is a very well balaced beer. The hops, though they are strong and bitter to the taste, they are evenly balanced with a fitting amount of malt. It had a bit of a graininess going down that lost it some points. It could also have had a more robust taste. But they have the 90 minute for that.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,longpondbeerman,4.47,"I've been enjoying this wonderful IPA for quite some time, and discovered recently (actually, my son discovered) that I had never written a review of it. Serendipitously, this turns out to be my 100th beer review; how appropriate for a brew that I absolutely love.  I first had the Dogfish Head 60 on tap at The Great Lost Bear in Portland, Maine (a great place, by the way), but this review is for the bottle brew, which pours a murky orange-gold hue with only a minimum of head--still a little sticky lacing occurs. The tart smell is dominated by hops and citrus, though there is an underlying maltiness somewhere back there. The taste is deeply imbued with grapefruit balanced by a touch of pine and an evanescence of caramel. The thickly sparkling mouthfeel enhances the complexity of the ale, coating my throat with a residue of gentle bitterness.  This is one of my favorite IPAs; and certainly even close to the top of my ale heap overall.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,FranklinPCombs,4.37,"The brew pours a pale orange ocher from the bottle, with a quickly diminishing head, but plenty of lace. The smell is sweet at first, and immediately hoppy, with grapefruit and other citrus flavors rounding it out. The piny part of the hops comes out too. The flavor of this beer is something quite beautiful. Its a perfect blend of hops, malt, citrus (lemon and grapefruit that I taste), with a subtle syrupy sweetness. The mouthfeel is something I ususally dont write that much about but this beer desreves it. It starts off with a warming bite to the back of the throat, which builds into a rising sour sweetness that grows up from the back of the mouth. It all ends with a return of the warming feeling to the throat, and leaves a nice piny aftertaste from the malts. Quite a beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,dannyvee,4.82,"Sampled possibly a touch too cold in a pint glass. A vigorous pour resulted in a two finger, chunky white head. This quickly subsided into a respectable half inch which stuck around for the remainder of the glass. The color was a cloudy golden-copper with a fair amount of sediment in suspension. Floral citrus and pine dominated the nose. Taste is a perfect level of hoppiness-- I guess they're saving the full on tastebud assult for the 120 minute. The finish was slightly peppery, refreshing and bone dry. I could drink this one all night.  Dare I proclaim that this is the best IPA I've tasted? I will dare.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TheJudge,4.22,"I could sit and drink this beer all day. A beautiful amber color that poured a beautiful off white head which laced nicely down the glass. The hop presence is notable, but more on the nose than in the mouth. You will not be overwhelmed by the hop presence when you drink it, and I think that is what makes it so highly drinkable for the long haul. While it tingles the tongue going in, and has a very nice soft hop aftertaste, the flavor is not overpowering, and it makes you want another. And another. And another...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,halfpgl,4.28,"This is a solid beer with a well-balanced hop nose, and flavor. The bitterness could use a slight boost but thats what the 90-minute is for. The copper color is an indication of the rich taste. I put this in the same class is Tuppers Hop Pocket which is one of my favorites. The head stays present is the proper quantities and doesnt distract from the quaffing, and this beer is VERY quaffable. I've also had this beer on-tap and it brings out the aroma and hop flavoring VERY nicely. For that I bump it up another .5 on smell.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,smcolw,3.95,"Appearance is a cloudy amber with a chalk-white head that holds up well and leaves an excellent lace.  The smell is like a bouquet of flowers particularly roses and daisies. Strong dry hop and grassy aromas as well.  Very bitter like an excellent IPA; some very light malt flavors. The lingering aftertaste is like sucking on a hop pellet. Heavily carbonated which helps cut the strong hop bite a little.  As a hop head, this is a beer I can enjoy. If you shy away from heavily hopped beers, shy away from this one as it is nearly all bitter hop.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,abents,4.48,Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden brown with a light white head that lingers for a while.  Smells: smells of citrusy hops with a slight spicy note to it.  Taste: This brew rocks the hops with a light citrusy taste almost sweet until the bitterness wipes that away in the finish leaving you refreshed  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with slight carbonation this one feels wonderful swishing down the throat.  Drinkability: Extremely drinkable with a great finish that leaves you wanting another sip.  Overall a fantastic beer and one of the top 10 IPA's in my book.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,budsboy,3.79,"Pours a cloudy weak amber with a thin white head and nice lacing. Lots of little bubbles in there.  Smell is the first clue that something wonderful this way comes. A spicy little number, coriander and pine.  Let this one roll around in there and you'll appreciate it even more. Nice biting hops with a sweetness at first, changing quickly to bitter and a dry finish.  Carbonation is pretty well balanced, maybe a bit on the over-side.  Good stuff, this Dogfish. I'm encouaged to buy more from these fellows.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,jackndan,3.18,"Dogfish 60 Minute IPA: Hmm, to my surprise Ive never reviewed this extremely floral/hopped IPA, well, it aint bad, but I have to admit I prefer the standard IPA, at least as compared to this brew.  Pours a hazy golden, with a nice head and decent lacing. Fairly nice looking pure white head, with some fine staying power.  The aroma is, as already noted, very floral. The tastes are a major blast of hops, but Im more than a little sorry that there is not a corresponding blast of sweet malts to balance this beer out. Im at least a big a hop head as the next guy, and this is not an unpleasant brew, but the dryness it leaves in the aftertaste seems to suggest that a bit more maltiness would or could have done the trick.  Definitely a little too much for a session brew, and not one that Id think about having more than a couple at a time. Fine well made brew, just a little to far out of balance, but not so far out of balance that it would replace a true hop monster like the Imperial IPAs.  I want to like this beer, and have an inkling that itd go great with some hearty food. Anyone have any ideas?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,WesWes,4.42,"The beer pours a hazy yellowish orange color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is great. It has a very intense floral hop scent that penetrates deep. It is a thing of beauty. The taste is also great. It has a pale malt palate with some carapils malts for body, but the main focus is on the hopping. It is dominated with a floral hop character that is intense from the moment it hits your mouth to the moment it is swallowed. It has a nice bitterness to it and finishes refreshingly. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is one of the best IPA's I've ever had. I'm almost sorry when I empty my glass. Another winner from Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,mikeys01,3.78,"Served from a 12 oz bottle. Pours out a very clear amber color, capped with a voluminous head consisting of tight white bubbles. Aroma is hoppy to the point of being almost frightening, a very interesting mix of piney hops and frsh mown grass, there's a certain sharpness to it that you don't find in most IPA's. Taste is drenched with acidic grapefruit hop flavor and a strong pine as well. There's something different in the nose and flavor that adds a certain herbal tang, that I'm still trying to put a finger on. Nice sweet malt flavor comes along mid-way through, but it cannot compete with the hops. You're left with a resounding bitterness that keeps going and going. Definitely another unique IPA from the Dogfish family, worth a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,coasterfreak75,4.85,"From the first pour out of the glass I thought I might be in for a real treat. The copper hue shocked the wadden out of me. The smell, slightly fruity with a hint of evergreen. The thin head held on until the last sip. Now the taste, here is the big treat, a super hop bite at the start. Not too much so it burns, just the right bite. The finish is hoppy but clean. This is now my favorite IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,necoadam,3.89,"Yum...IPA! I love IPA's. Poured out an orange/pale goldish color. Still see some floating yeast going around. Smell was nice. Mostly consisted of flower hops and got a wiff of some wood smell too. Mint? Could be, can't be sure of that. Taste was nice and hoppy, just the way I like it. Some citrus hints breakthrough as well. Also got some grassy undertones. It's quite different from Victory's HopDevil, but both are very good.  *After burping a few times, that wood flavor really kicks in as an aftertaste. Just to let you know.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Appearance: Quite hazy from the yeast that seemed to be loose in the bottle, decent head retention as a thin white lace stays intact.  Smell: Mildly estery with hints of floral citric hop, cookie like malt and a faded buttery yeast combo.  Taste: Lots of fresh hop oil flavour, very juicy with citric and bitter herbal tones. Solid maltiness holds up to the hops well with a dough toasted grain mix. Touch of nutty yeast with a slight warmth from estery alcohol. Finish semi-dry with a long lingering bitter finish from the hops.  Notes: An idea IPA to have around, very drinkable and very flavourful.

10099,6108,Gueuzedude,4.17,"Hazy orange-copper color. Fairly low carbonation for an American-beer, which suits me to a T. Topped by a off white head. The aroma is pure hops at this point; notes of herbal-grass, orange, grapefruit, and a sharp note that I can't quite place. The beer is perhaps a bit cold at this point, so I let it warm up. The taste is nicely hoppy in all ways. It is packed with hop flavor and a nice sharp bitterness in the finish. Has a fair amount of alcohol in the finish for a 6%'er. Notes of grapefruit, and a strong flowery nectar type character are here from the hops. The hops seem to contribute some notes of pine & perhaps a hint of mint as well. This is one of those beers where your tongue just tingles from the level of hops used in making this beer. The beer is medium bodied & a bit malty sweet, which, helps to carry the hop flavor through this beer, though I think that a bit more maltiness would really help this beer to reach another level.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,emericanchaos,4.65,"Looks great. What you expect from this breed of beer. Pours nice with a strong tight head.  Smells of hops and other treats but nothing very outstanding. Understated smell really  Taste is wonderful. In fact i'm going to change my taste rating from 4.5 to 5. Great hit of hops in the begining. Great amount of sweetness as far as beer goes but not really a candied drink like Troeg's hopback. Finishes like a ninja. Very stealthy. Absolutely no bitterness in my opinion. Lingering after taste remnant of the high hops introduction.  Feels light but still substantial. Easy to hold in your mouth considering the alchohol content.  Extremely drinkable. Great beer for a parties and socializing.  Notes. OMG! This is just wonderful. I wish the big corporate brews would take notes on this one. I went through 4 of these in merely 30 minutes. Let that be a testament to it's drinkability. I actually ended up walking back to get more. Tastes wonderful, warms your belly, doesn't over power your mouth.

Bitter, but not overwhelmingly so. Slightly dry aftertaste.  Overall, great IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,sideshowrob,4.47,"This is a great, agressive IPA style brew. It is my favorite out of the DFH minute series of beers (60, 90, 120). All three seem to be brewed from similar recipies, and there are similar tastes in each one, with different notes domminating each brew. (The sickingly sweet malty notes that obiliterate all other tastes in the 120 IPA are merely ""present"" in this brew!)  Can't really ask for more out of the appearance of an IPA. Perfect golden amber with a nice bit of haze to it. Very tempting. Lovely sent of Hop aroma upon first smell, again this beer just loves to be drunk. Taste does not dissapoint. Very distinctive DFH hop style, blended with just enough interesting sugars (Belgium perhaps?) to make it real interesting. This is not a complex IPA in the Avery 10 or Dreadnaught manner, but it is a very well executed ""simple"" IPA. This makes it very easy to drink it down all night long.

I decided to try the IPAs in order starting with the 60 minute and working up to the 120. The beer pours golden amber in color with a good sized head (about two inches) with a vigorous pour in a pint glass. The head is not real long lasting but the lacing is fantatic, off-white and traveling the lenght of the glass. The overwhelming aroma is that of hops. I am a hophead, and this was what I was looking for. There is a pine undertone. The taste is hop bitter with a slight pine flavor and an even smaller hint of citrus. This is a good one for hop lovers. It feels thick in the mouth with a hop and citrus tang. The carbonation is light. It is a drinkable beer, not the best IPA, but a solid entry in the market.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,twilight,3.2,"Though it pours pretty into the glass, and smells great, the bottle I sampled was far too hoppy for me to be satisfied with it. There's a huge hop kick, with a really bitter aftertaste that doesn't seem to be balanced with any malts. It's like eating part of a hop pellet. It tastes nice what with the hopheadedness and all, but there's just not much else there. I can't detect much else beyond the citrusy sourness of the beer informed by the hops. Because of the high bitterness, I can't see myself drinking it continuously. Nevertheless, I do think it is an interesting experiment, a super-hoppy beer.

I am not a huge fan of their other beers, but the 60, 90 and 120 minutes are all well done. I had the 60 minute from a bottle and it looked great when poured into a glass. The nice amber/rubyish color of a great IPA with an intense hop smell. The taste was nice and piney/citrusy with that great hop bite that tickles the tongue.

10099,6108,dmarch,4.42,"I have enjoyed dogfish head in the past, but after coming to the conclusion that dogfish head only makes elaborate specialty beers, I try this one. Bottom line is that there is nothing unique about this beer besides it being absolutely spectacular. Orange-gold in color with a thick white head.

The nose was citrus-y and hoppy (lots!). Initial taste was of heavy hops, supplanted by light maltiness. Although this beer is called an IPA, I believe that the body is too light for that designation, and it's quite apparent in the mouth, as it doesn't have the beefiness I would expect from a true IPA. Still, this is a very well-made, hoppy ale, and the fine bittering hops linger on the tongue nicely.

10099,6108,Foxman,4.09,"It pours a light orange, like iced tea with lemon, and quite hazy, The head is decent right away, and drops quickly to a spotty froth, and leaves a dainty clinging lace.  The aroma brings first hops, and second hops, somewhat piney and floral, along with citrus. There seems a very slight sourness under the fruit tones. The malt sneaks through sporadically.  The first wave of flavor sloshes hop bitterness about the mouth, followed by the slight tang of citrus, perhaps mandarin orange. The hops soon yield to tendrils of light malt sweetness dancing on the palate. There's a tentative balance here, with the hops winning by a somewhat large nose.  It's meduim bodied, flowing around the mouth distributing fruity hops bitter-dryness as its legacy. It slides down slick and smooth.  Again, it's not an equal balance, but fetching nonetheless. While it lacks the heft of its 90 Minute big brother, as well as the higher ABV, it stands well on its own merits. The hops are potent and refreshing, and while the malt is very present, it's not so strong that it makes drinking more than one or two a challenge. Emminently drinkable, it's a standby for me, with at least 2 sixers in the cooler most times, ready to deliver my hop fix.

Balanced, but faint malt. Very deep and rich, complex hop oils and leaves. Very clean hop oil taste. Dee-lish hop bite that is so full and tastey without being overpowering or residual.

Medium body with smooth carbonation. Note that being on tap may have an effect on this depending on how the bar sets its CO2. This particular bar has it just right. The taste is a complex mix of toasted grains and sweet crystal malts up front and is follwed by grapefruit skin and spicy hops. The taste then swings back toward the grain and then to hops again only just citrus this time. It smooths out dry and leaves a thin coating on the inside of the cheeks with chewy hop flavor. YUMBO!

Nice smellin' IPA. Taste is smooth and calm with a creamy start, gains a solid medium feel and bold filling hoppyness thats easily bittered up front and a bit juicy and pulpy. Hops are nicely blended in with mild grasses and bitterness, comes across fresh and lightly dried with very small hints of pine, soft earth, and citrus. Finish has alot of complexity with some hop resin bitterness and toasty maltedness, some of which really sticks around long after each sip becoming slightly drying. Nothing to strong mind you, all very mild and easy, but flavorful and enjoyable. Very nice feel, a nice crescendo of creamy to pulpy, to nearly full, to a nice easy fine finish with lingering bitter tones and a small dryness late.

10099,6108,ElGordo,3.65,"Pours a nice light orange with a frothy head. Laces nicely on the glass, and the yeast suspends nicely in the beer. Floral hoppy nose with a mouthfeel that's a bit gentler than one would suspect from such an assertively hoppy beer. And I mean ASSERTIVE. Lots of hops up front, in the middle, and on the finish. Really good hops, at that. I've had 90 Minute before, but this is my first foray into the original. I'm an immediate fan, this is going to become a frequent purchase for me now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,yankeeheel,2.81,"Pours a really nice looking hazy orange/peach color. Smells strongly of yeast.  The taste is a huge letdown. Slight fruity character and a huge rush of hops. Not good hops, but a lot of hops. I understand the style, but this is not a well balanced beer at all. I've had many IPA's that taste a lot better put together.  If you like hops till you drop it's for you, not me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Dogbrick,3.97,"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Oct 13th, 2003: Pours a light amber color with a medium off-white head. Fair lacing. Aroma of mellow hops and citrus. Medium-bodied and somewhat hoppy, but there really wasn't much else going on in the flavor. The aftertaste contains more of a hops bite than the beer provides initially. While pretty good I will go back to the higher-minute DFH beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,aracauna,3.7,"was able to taste this one beside both the 90 Minute and the 120 Minute. This is a pretty typical IPA. It's pretty dry with good malt backbone that's surprisingly dominated by the straw malt flavors I expect from pilsners and the like. The beer is hoppy, but not really surprisingly so. The body was a dark gold with a very faint copperish tint, and the head was an excellent white froth. The end didnt' have all that much bitterness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,GeoffRizzo,4.5,"Cloudy bright orange hue, thin layer of head, decent lacing throughout. A fresh fruit and hops aroma easy to detect and quite pleasant on the nose. Up front, this is one great tasting beverage. Has an upfront dry malty base with a sticky, quenching dose of hops. Tons of flavors detected throughout; earthy, minty, grassy hop flavoring, simply incredible. Stays bitter, yet pleasantly dry throughout, medium bodied with a peppery/spicy finish. A classic, a staple, near-perfect-session-IPA, one wonderful and delicious brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,Brent,4.5,"This beer lives in the shadow of its 90 and 120 min. big brothers, and in my estimation, is one of the more underappreciated APA/IPAs on the market. Much as I love Stone's products, I think this beer holds its own in the hops department. The aroma is an evergreen sap that announces that a hops extravaganza is in store. Hops in abundance, but not so overdone that they burn. Very smooth and drinkable. There is no effort to balance the hops with the malt, this is all about the hops. Yet, the malt is sufficient to cast out a sea anchor to keep the hops from sailing away into excess.  In Stephen Beaumont's ""A Taste for Beer"" he includes a satirical bit about ""Beware the Hop-Head"" and speculates that hop-heads are a mutation of homo sapiens brought about by years of mega-brewery hops deprivation. He warns that a hop-head is marked by an adoration of all things hoppy, regardless of balance. Okay, I'm a mutant. Bring on the hops. This will be our national drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,cerevisiaephilus,4.2,"This beer is not your traditionally hoppy beer. It tastes very unique. Must be the continual hopping. I also heard the hops are wrung out into the beer, I've seen little flecks of hops in the beer numerous times. The beer is kind of dry, but this might be the weird hop taste that gives me this impression. Really tasty.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,powerpop,4.74,"I love this beer! My favorite IPA so far in my quest for a ""most favorite beer of all."" Strong grapefruity, hoppy taste, and an aftertaste that is exceptional.

10099,6108,sponberg,4,"Pours a nice bright amber-orange-copper, with a thin white head that doesn't seem to mind hanging around for a while. The aroma's full of piney, citric hoppiness - almost tart, definitely a juicy smell.  It's all about the hops, baby - this one's loaded with a grapefruit rind and pine hop flavor that is sweet-tart-bitter almost to the point of being mouthwatering. There is some biscuity, slightly caramelly but dryish malt here, but the hops rule. Finishes bittersweet, with those bigass hops carrying through to the end. One of the best brews I've had from DFH, a fine example of an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,brewdlyhooked13,4.33,"Pours an apricot color with a murky haze. Tight creamy head, almost like a cream ale. Reduces to a filmy covering and leaves a 'peaks and valleys' pattern on the glass edge, like the profile of a distant mountain range.  The aroma brings out (for me) what is meant by a 'piney' scent. Extremely so and very interesting. Some floral by-notes but not much. Somewhat one-dimensional, but it does that one dimension to the hilt.  Some brief malt sweetness on the initial taste, quickly giving way to the floral hop barrage. A unique complex of flavors on the swallow - straight up bitterness, fruity and floral, but also some of the piney notes alluded to above and certainly a big dose of grapefruit on the finish. The underlying malt base is thin at best and disappears at times, but still has some presence at the end. Once the taste buds get past the initial hit, the flavors meld together better.  Lots of carbonation, expect to burp a few flowers here. Light syrupiness, a bit chewy. Great staying power for that 'taste afterglow'.  Initially I'm thinking this is too over the top, but after getting through half of it, I find it harder to keep from drinking it down. This is a powerfully tasty beer, you'd be spoiling yourself having it for a session, but that's one of the objectives here, finding great beers to spoil ourselves with, right?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,beerinator,4.04,"Appearance: Light golden brown, slightly cloudy with decent head retention on the white head  Aroma: Definate piney notes, with some sharp citrusy grapefruit in the aroma. Complex hop aroma.  Taste: Very dry and lingering finish, with a bitterness that starts near the front of the tongue. Toasty malt is overtaken by the hop flavor quickly in the tasting. Bitterness isn't too sharp, not quite throwing the beer off balance.  Notes: Fun beer for IPA afficianados. Complexity in the hop flavor and aroma is nice.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,stegmakk,4.23,Beautiful hazy orange copper...nice thick head mellowing nicely with good lacing... Aroma of hops and well...more hops...piney floral like...

10099,6108,Boilermaker88,4.24,"01-06-04: Review edited: aside from the appearance, I boosted the numbers on this IPA from DFH as this beer is becoming a staple IPA at my house and a good introductory beer for those willing to venture out from under the boring beer umbrella. As my tastes have, well, matured, I felt it only fair to give 60 Min. IPA another chance and it has proven itself to be a solid, well balanced, and tasty IPA.  ---  My other DFH find at the local Trader Joe's. Poured a hazy apricot color with a thin white head that quickly faded to form a thin ring. Smell was mainly of hops (duh!), rather floral, with a faintly bitter aroma lurking underneath. Taste was all hops - citrus giving way to a rather heavy piney bitterness. Very little in the way of malt flavor but I've come to expect this from an IPA. Long lingering bitter finish. Feel was medium to full-bodied, smooth and dry. Overall, a decent brew. 60 Min IPA doesn't beat you over the head with hops yet still has that hoppy bite that'll please hops-lovers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,grynder33,4.3,"Cloudy light amber color, with visible setiment, quickly disappearing head. Strong hoppy fruity aroma,a taste with orange like aftertaste. Stayed bold right to the end.

10099,6108,Wildman,4.12,"Okay, this is the first this Dogfish style has been available in Ohio, even though it is lower proof than the other ones. This beer poured a very cloudy copper orange color(it did say bottle conditioned) with little carbonation and formed an off white foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. The aroma was heavy of hops, but not overpowering of one type, thereby being quite balanced. The flavor was of hops, with very little malt with a bit of a caramel aspect. The body was rather heavy/chewy for this style with the finish being astrigent yet a bit sweet. Not a bad style, maybe helped by the fact that Dogfish was doing less experimenting on this one, sometimes a good thing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,GreatPondBrewer,4,"On tap at the Great Lost Bear. Poured a yellow(in the more syrupy, lighter color catogory of IPA) and had a nice little foam white head not too much lace. Smelled sweet with a ton of grapefruit hop citrus and alcoholic peach. Taste was syrupy and heavy with tons of hops not too much malts, just a tiny touch of wheat towards the end. Loved the mouthfeel as it was velvet like. This is in the same vein as Stone IPA and Rogue I2PA in appearence and consistency, but perhaps a mite easier in the drinking catogory as it is much easier going. I would have no problem drink a bunch of these as the alcohol is not as bombastic as some of the other big IPAs. The first dogfish head I really liked.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Stubbie1,3.63,"This IPA pours a nice gold color. A medium white head is at the end of the pour. Aromas of hops fill the air with hints of mild citrus and pine mixed in. Taste is a straight hop up front attack with a mild and I do mean mild malt flavor lingering around with an all hop finish were the citrus flavor comes in. There is a bit of a film that covers the mouth after the swallow. Nice body and easy to drink. I do admit I was expecting more from this IPA, but an above average IPA. No to find the others.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,beerguy101,4,"Medium orange color. Medium head. Aroma is citrusy hops. A fuller bodied IPA. Malts are fruity and slightly sweet. Hops are grapefruity and piney. The hops are very prominent and are definitely in the forefront taste wise, but its still a very well balanced beer. Nice big chewy hops. Smooth taste. Not as intense as the 90 minute IPA. Very nice IPA. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is fruity and then slightly bitter.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

It's orangish-gold with a big white head that leaves a slight layer on the top of the glass all the way down. The smell is interesting, a mix of hops, herbs, and malt. A nice sweetness comes through after it sits for a while. The mouthfeel is nice and chunky. At $5.99, this is quite a bargain.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,nomad,4.2,"Poured a hazy bright orange color, with large frothy white head, lots of steady carbonation, and some little fingers of stain left behind. A good looker. Smelled of major grapefruit, pine, and cannibus scents. A serious hop presence but still a strong sweet citrus smell, too.  Taste was fruity and not as bitter as youd think as a big malt creates this beer. So, it comes across with a tiny sweet at first followed by a bitterness moderate in leafy flavor and parching in effect. A solid IPA in that the bitter doesnt send your mouth flying to handle crazy flavors shooting off. Overall, a simple taste with a fizzy action on the tongue, combined with the relatively thicker mouthfeel, is nice. For me, a very good IPA to have around, better to sniff than drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,nixhecks,4.03,"Poured a nice, deep bronze/amber color with an plentiful pancake head that dissapated at a medium pace to a thin ever-present head. The aroma was rich with hops with a hint of what smelled like some sort of candy (butterscotch???) I noticed that when real cold, the taste was mostly of hops - a very highly hopped ale with plenty of chewy bitterness. However, when warmed up a bit this reminded me of a cross between an amber ale and a barleywine...wierd. Basically, when warmed a little bit, it starts of with a malty richness, and then gives way to a hop-powered bitter finish. Throughout the sip there is a steady candy/alcohol/earthy taste that compliments nicely and adds tons of character. A unique and lively brew with a nice kick - the previous reviewer must have had to have mislabeled brews.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,LiquidBreadMan,3.18,"After reading the other reviews here, I wonder if my six-pack was mislabled. Either way...  The 60-Minute IPA poured a beautiful deep gold with a very short lived head. The aroma is more reminiscent of a stout than an IPA -- smoke and chocolate (with the addition of pronounced hops) -- and nary a hint of citrus. The taste is much the same. Mouthfeel is dry and heavy with a coffee-like aftertaste.  Overall, this is a decent beer. It just wasn't what I expected in an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

A splash of lime.  Taste shows a big grassy, floral hop flavor. Grainy, biscuity malt underneath. A hint of lemon and lime. Hop flavor and bitterness throughout.  Good mouthfeel. Somewhat creamy.

I found the flavor to be a bit over powing with strong citrus grapefruit taste and well balanced .

10099,6108,kevinl6,3.85,"Picked this up at the Harris Teeter in Charlotte (see my forum post)....what a pleasant surprise! This is the first Dogfish IPA I've tried. Poured nice and somewhat thick for an IPA, which I liked. Very little head on this one, the little that was there was ""lacy"". A nice honey/orange color in the glass, very inviting. The smell was strong and fruity. Citric came to mind when I smelled it. Very good drinkability, I could put down a few of these for sure. Has a very 'hoppy' taste, but its not too much. A very flavorful, refreshing brew that has only a slight alcohol warmth in the finish.

First few tastes showed a nice balance between the hops and malt, with the hops not being overpowering. Perfect carbonation, very refreshing for an IPA. A light malty taste lingers on the tongue. Slight lace forms on the glass with each taste, but doesn't hang around for long.

Aroma is spicy, with grassy, piney hops and some yeast. medium mouthful with not too overpowering carbonation is followed by a rough, grassy hop flavor, as well as some breadiness. A bit on the mild side after the strong aroma. Finish smooths out with slight alcohol and then a massive, long lasting hop assault ensues.  First impressions are that the taste and mouthful doesn't measure up to the aroma. The aroma and the finish are super strong but the mouthful and taste seem to be missing something. Also, a little on the harsh side.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,marburg,3.58,"Orange brew with a soapy, lingering, white head that's continuously revitalized with every movement of the glass. Aromas are a little from the hospital chest but a lot from the hop plant -- piney and strong. Understated maltiness that gets lost in the swamp of hop flavors -- a fairly potent and brutal hop assault overwhelms most of the complexities. A little creamy...medium bodied. Some of the ""lesser"" flavors -- some light citrus fruits -- came out to play as it warmed. But for the most part, this is a hop monster. The piney, sappy bitterness is the finishing note, and it lingers and lingers and lingers. It's twenty minutes after the last sip, and I can still feel the bitterness dripping from the back corners of my mouth.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The nose is hoppy and provides both citrus and floral notes. I found the flavor to be a bit distressing as the strong citrus grapefruit taste is quite raw and unbalanced. It seems to be over the top in its hop bite and this carries into the aftertaste which is bitter and lasting. There is also an astringency in the feel that is not pleasant. Not one of the best IPAs I've sampled.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,PatandDavid,3.65,"Just had this for the first time. Beautiful golden color. Nice head and lace left in the glass. Very fresh aroma of hops.  I actually thought this was rather mild. It is hoppy, but not in your face. The one thing I did find, which makes me say that it is not quite as drinkable as it could be, is that the aftertaste is bitter. I know that's from the hops, but I usually don't get this strong a bitter aftertaste.  I would get this again, but didn't enjoy it as much right off as I did the 90 minute. Pat",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,taez555,4.07,"This beer poured a very cloudy amber body with a very thick white head. Tiny pieces of hop pellet sediment were floating all around in the beer.  The nose had a huge floral hop aroma. Very citrusy but leaning a lot more towards the floral end. Most of the malt smells were drowned out by the hops.  The taste was a bit surprising after the nose. Medium bodied. It hit with a big malt taste. Followed by a beautiful fresh citrus peel hop attack. Never overly hoppy, it balanced very well with the malt flavor.  It finished very soft, but was quickly followed by another burst of hop bitterness that lingered for some time.  For such a forboding name as 60 minute IPA, you'd think this beer was going to knock you down with hops. Amazingly it's quite mellow and easy drinking. Very hoppy, but not so in your face you can't drink it. Perfectly balanced and aged just right.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,leeenglewood,3.85,Appearance would have scored higher being that it pours with a beautiful thick head and has a nice copper orange color. The head never dissipated and has champagne like carbonation keeping the head going but its flaw is that it has huge chunks of spent hops that float around in the carbonation that looks like their dancing in your glass because they never settle out to the bottom of the glass. This fish food look just doesnt do this beer justice. Smell is of hop and hops alone nothing bad but nonetheless not stellar because you cant smell the malt that you can taste. Tasted of nicely hops but was not overpowering in anyway for its series of hops infusions threw out the boil and some malt does shine threw albeit not much. Nice mouthful not creamy but not watery just right. I would definitely drink this beer again as it is very good ipa that really isnt extreme in very drinkable. Have one or two on a nice summer day to refresh with.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The aroma is dominated by floral hops. I pick up a weak malt note too, but this beer is supposed to be all about the hops isn't it? Pretty straightforward beer. Slightly astringent and of course hop driven. There is a green grassiness here that is a bit offputting. A good beer, but not stellar. I'll be honest, I was expecting a little more here.

Taste: Well-defined, bready, biscuity malt-backbone; lightly sweet upfront; moderate-to-heavy floral, grassy, piney hop-bitterness pervades; slight notes of mint and yeast.

10099,6108,purplehops,4.45,"60 Minute pours a hazy light golden amber with a dirty white head that leave plenty of sticky lace on the glass. The aroma is an astringent slap of citrus hops with just a hint of biscuit malt in the far away background. The taste starts with an intense rush of earthy green. The green of a pine forest in winter; the green of new chives in spring; the green of fresh cut lawn in summer; the green of walking through a hop field in early fall. This is the closes thing to fresh hops in a beer that I have ever had (did they even bother to dry these hops?). After the initial rush of green, toasty biscuit and crystal malts push their way through the hop forest to make themselves known. This is followed by a nice balance of the malts with a slightly softer floral hop flavor. The finish is crisp with a slight surrender of the malts in favor of more floral and spice hop flavors. Aftertaste is a return to a pleasant lingering earthy greenness with a faint hint of malt that makes you want more. Mouthfeel has a pleasant carbonation that amplifies the sharpness of the hops along with a medium body. Overall a very nice unusual and flavorful ale. This is not your run of the mill American IPA (it has Dogfish Head written all over it). This IPA is about hops and nothing else. The malt is there only to support the hops and bring about a unique balance. Another one of the 100 or so must try once beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Boto,4.59,"There is a dark, golden color to the beer. Maybe there is a hint of orange to it. It is slightly cloudy. The head is sort of a taupe color, which didn't last long at all. Very potent hop aroma. Somewhat grapefruit-like. Really good hop bite to the taste, but yet they do not overpower you, even with the strength. Has some maltiness in the after-taste. Another great beer from these guys!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Mark,3.95,"Finally got to try this when my Butcher friend told me it was at Trader Joe's. It poured a cloudy golden color, head was thick and lasted all the way down. Surprisingly, lacing was almost nil until the bottom part of the glass. Aroma was quite subtle. Taste profile was well balanced with hop notes being peppery rather than piney or grapefruit like. It sort of reminded me of Hop Devil. Nice mouthfeel and with the 6%abv this can be as Randy the Butcher said, a good session IPA. Very nice, but I think I like West Coasters better.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

Excellent mouthfeel, with high drinkability,",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Rumrunner,3.91,This is a well made but simple tasting IPA. Not much complexity. That does not make it bad just simple. I enjoyed it but I did not jump for joy.  The pour showed a cloudy foggy burnt orange color with little to no head. A few particles floating around and at the bottom of my glass when all was said and done. The scents are strong citrus with a dryness about the odor.  The taste from beginning to end is consistent. I like the hoppy flavor. It gives the ale a bit of a bite. A bit too much citrus for me. The IPA finishes with a dry resonance of the hops.  Overall an average IPA for the complex hop head drinker.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Jon,4.35,"A subdued relative of the 120- and 90-Minute IPAs by Dogfish Head, this is a hoppy brew in itself. The pour makes way for a deep, hazy copper liquid with a firm white head. The head sticks around for a while before settling into a small ring, leaving some lace down the glass. Aroma is like a pine forest. Notes of piney, citric, resinous hops explode at first. Very little malt can be detected in the nose. The first sip, however, shows that this IPA has more depth. The taste is definitely hoppy, full of notes of citrus and pine. A sturdy malt backbone, however, looms beneath, creating a nice balance that even a non-hophead can enjoy. Hops, though, definitely are the main event, and hop burps are prevalent long after imbibing. The mouthfeel is quite carbonated, but not overly so. This beer drinks fairly easily, as well. I'm glad the 60-Minute was introduced in six packs. I can certainly stand to enjoy some more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ADR,3.63,"Orangey and lightly hazy appearance and sporting a very nice and frothy 1/2 inch head of medium duration and nice lacing properties. Resinous balsam aromas, slight sense of a light machine oil. Pithy flavors, stout piney and orangey Amarillo hops and some unfortunate phenols dominate the overall impression -- though not as huge as a Rogue Brutal Bitter. Ligher in tone and body. Malt balance is lacking, slight shortbread, but none of the malt of the 90 Minute Ale, which whacks back with sweetness. I can be in the mood for this at times, but too tipped toward Lysol for my normal IPA tastes.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,cokes,4.05,"Blurry golden-orange with a milky, off-white companion above. Mentholated nose, with pine sprigs, wet steel, toast and pepper. Biscuit malt up front, immediately succumbing to a blanketing hop presence. Not ultra-agressive in terms of hop girth, but the cones are certainly showcased. Impressive in the multi-facited hues they provide. Equally piney, metallic, smokey and earthy. Lightly resinous, and seems more potently bitter on the burp. Grapefruit-drenched herbs and dried grass. Peppery too, from both the evident yeastiness as well as the hops. Malt never quits, as it becomes increasingly toasty with each sip and as the liquid warms. Some distracting medicinal qualities waver in and out in terms of intensity, but are consistently noted. Rusty tasting as well- neither a compliment nor complaint, merely an observation. Balance, however, is lovely, even when some of the other parts are not.  There is alot to this IPA in terms of flavor and uniqueness, but it never quite seems to jive and acheive the greatness that it appears to possess.  Despite the lack of overall flavor integration, this is still a well-done IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,feloniousmonk,4.28,"Appearance: sets the stage uneventfully with the color, a typical bright orange for an IPA, then springs on us a huge, cloud-like head, milky-white, soft and lacey. Aroma: a veritable pine forest that the nose is walking through, needle, sap and all! There's other kinds of sensation, some fruity, citric character, but that sharp piney, grassiness dominates. Big, stinging, and arousing. Taste is most unusual: biscuity, bready, yeasty, a substantial mouthful, slightly sour, still resonating with hops, and delivering an unspecific fruitiness, that mingles and blends with this breadish tone. Excellent texture, slightly chewy. Hoppiness rides above and shines throughout, but underneath is that other thick and yeasty quality, most unusual. Hops don't quit, either, they take up permanent residence in the mouth and continues to conquer throughout the tasty, long finish. I kept smackin' my lips throughout the contents of this bottle. Great drinking for any hophead, like me, and deserves points for sheer uniqueness alone. Thanks go out ot Marc77!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,tar,3.83,"Pours a cloudy light orange/amber with a think white head. Nice lacing of the glass. Smells strongly of hops--citrusy and floral hop aromas primarily. This is matched in the taste which is dominated by a sweet grapefruit hop taste. Some malt flavors are also present. A taste of spicy hops lingers in the mouth, particularly in the dry finish. Rather complex tasting beer. Medium bodied and not particularly smooth, although still a very enjoyable beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,bewareOFpenguin,4,"Smuggled two 12oz out curtoursy of a ""mixer sixer"". Poured a nice dark yellow with a robust head. It tasted crisp and hoppy, very hoppy but not a ""killer"" amount.

10099,6108,bmills1608,3.99,"Hazy dark gold color, poured a smallish foamy head, very white in color. The nose on this beer was intense, extremely spicy sharp hop aroma. Right after pouring, a stuck my nose in the glass and gave a good sniff, and it actually burned my nose for a second, and I had to jump back. I kid you not. The aroma just explodes with fresh and raw hops.  Taste is more of the same. Bitter from the start, raw hop juice, crunchy hard, citrus notes, a brittle sensation, spicy and floral. Malt?, malt?, barely enough to balance. This is a hoppy beer, and it dominates the flavor.. The mouthfeel was pretty soft.  Overall for me, this is an interesting beer for the hop quality alone. If anyone ever has a question as to what hop aroma and flavor is and how to detect it, point them to this beer and they will understand quick. The is no mistaking the hop flavors in this beer. They dominate it. This is the type of beer, tha for me, I would enjoy every now and then, but would'nt be a regular of mine. I really have to be in the mood for heavy hops to choose this thug.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,rabidawg,4,"$10.99/sixer at the Wine & Cheese Cask in Cambridge, MA.  Appearance: Golden-amber with a soft, sticky white head. Very nice lacing, and a small spritz of carbonation rising from the bottom. I couldn't keep all the yeast in the bottle, so the beer is slightly cloudy with flecks of yeasty goodness floating throughout.  Smell: Not as intense aroma as I expected. Definite citrus, hoppy nose, with a spicy backbone. Almost wit-like nose. Slight mustiness as the earthy edge makes itself known.  Taste: Never tasted cannabis in a beer before, but you know what they say about hops being its nearest cousin. I definitely got a mouthfeel of green at the end of the fist sip. Not as noticeable thereafter, becoming dominated by the dry, grapefruity hop taste. Light maltiness apparent in the middle, and finishes with a lingering green-hop flavor.   Very good American IPA. Certainly a big beer, and my first from Dogfish Head. I have to say, though, that in the future I will almost certainly go for the less expensive (by $3/sixer) and better (imho) Victory HopDevil.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Stopper,4.44,"Nice orange-yellow color and a bit cloudy. A small white head forms with the pour, but dissipates pretty soon to a small rim around the edge of the glass. A citrus fruit hop aroma balances well with a smell of big malt sweetness. First taste is a shock of a sort of toasted malty sweetness, followed quickly by a strong hop bitterness that persists well into the aftertaste, soon joined with the return of hop fruitiness in the flavor. The mouthfeel is big, and the hop bitterness balances very well, then takes over after swallowing.  This is a wonderfully drinkable beer, despite the big body, probably due to its being balanced by a very fresh-tasting, crisp hoppiness. I think I'll have to get me some more of this soon!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,beergeek279,4.47,"Served as a sample at the Penn Festival. The color was a golden blonde. The smell was that of hops. The taste was also of hops, although not overly done at 60 IBUs. The mouthfeel was very smooth, with no real note of alcohol. This is a very drinkable IPA, and I could drink this one all day!  Although this isn't an over-the-top beer in the way other DFH brews are, the 60 Minute IPA is surely one of the best standard IPAs put out by any brewery in the country.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

10099,6108,marc77,4.32,"Auburn hue, with dry hop derived polyphenol haze. Topped by a vanilla white, creamy, persistent head. Tattered lace remains. Pungent, bright, capricious wafts of chlorophyll laden spruce tips and tangerine zest are in the forefront aromawise, and are accompanied by a struggling contrast of light lovibond caramel malt. A delightful baleful of hops! Flavorwise, malt character is slightly more apparent, being comprised of a lightly honeyish, perfumed nature and serves to complement the dominant floral and resinous pine hop flavor well. Hop bitterness is surprisingly restrained, but since residual sweetness is minimal due to the high apparent attentuation, the overall character is dry. A tinge of bubblegum emerges mid palate, but is quickly tapered by a lingering suggestion of hopped rosewater. Lightly bodied, and mildly dextrinous, lending a crisp mouthfeel conducive to quaffability. Finishes clean, with fleeting bready base malt sweetness and muted citrus zest. A delicious, relatively well balanced IPA. Not overly assertive in hop bitterness, but redolent of American hop bouquet and rich in oily hop flavor. Unique and superbly drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,BeerManDan,2.53,"It poured a nice medium dark yellow with not a lot of foam. The smell is what warned me of what was to come. The aroma was like smelling a bunch of pitch on a pine tree. I had this kind of beer before. First taste told me that I had a heavy tasting pine tree. The first and last taste of this beer was like I was chewing on pine needles and pitch, combined. The second sip never reached my mouth, instead it was poured down the drain!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,TXHops,4.34,"-ABV: 6% -ABW: 4.7% -IBUs: 60 -Hops: Warrior, Amarillo, Hop X   I was so blown away by my first bottle of 90 Minute IPA (which Ive since discovered is surprisingly sensitive to wear and tear) that I couldnt wait to get my hands on the session version. The 60 Minute entered my world as a slightly turbid, yellow gold color with a nice looking, just-less-than-white head that was stickily lace-prone. The same sweet, flowery aroma of the 90 Minute was evident in the nosea testament to the sheer, brilliant beauty of continuous hopping. The beer smelled more like hops than it smelled hoppy. I was reminded of wildflower honey and orange marmalade-filled pastries at the same time. The flavor is still considerably hoppy, again, with the flavor of actual hops shining through more than the usual hoppiness of an IPA. Boiling hops results in the hoppiness that Ive become accustomed to: piney, lemony, grapefruity, etc 60 Minute tasted more like licking my fingers after handling whole leaf hops than a standard IPA, though less so than 90 Minute. Also unlike 90 Minute, this beer relented on the actual hop flavor, and settled into a more standard hoppy bitterness in the tail, conjuring mental images of fuzzy, leafy, green herbs. The malt was right there with the humulus lupulus the entire time, but like a pro sports agent, was perfectly content to simply watch the real star shine, and bask in some of the ambient light. However, without a solid, though unobtrusive malt base, there would be no pastry aroma, nor much sweetness to the honey suggestions.  60 Minute is a wonderful session IPA (as Sam suggests), but without the real kick of the 90 Minute. Better than many IPAs, but oddly, not quite as complexa little bit is lacking in the mouthfeel and in the potential malt-based complexity. However, if youre looking to understand the flavor of hops (specifically Warrior, Amarillo and Mystery Hop X), then this is the quintessential starting place. 60 Minute is a lovely showcase of the reason that so many people drink better beerbehold the power of HOPS!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,SheepNutz,4,"I had this brew in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. The 60 pours a copper/orange color that is just a little bit hazey. There is 1 finger of head that dies down a bit quickly, but there is good lacing. The only thing I can really detect from smell is hops. The smell is very potent. The taste isn't as hoppy as the smell. It has a good balance for an IPA, a bit of ginger in the taste. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy. Good drinkability too, and at only 6%, this is one IPA to enjoy several of in a night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

On the six pack container was a note from DFH quoting Lew Bryson to the effect that this beer is the closest thing to a cask conditioned ale that you'll find in a bottle. Well, having gone to a cask conditioned (ie: 'real ale') fest yesterday, I'd have to agree. Beautiful hop flavor w/ a creamy finish makes this a world class IPA in my book.

10099,6108,TheLongBeachBum,3.97,"So I scoot on down to Traders Joes in Long Beach, the Chicken Curry I recently masterfully created was now 6 days old, and had reached peak maturation. But I had no Chapattis  Damn!! A recent Trader Joes advert had a new line advertised  yep Chapattis. Earlier in the week, a fellow BA DavidBanner had tipped me off that TJs were now also stocking the infamous DFH 60 minute IPA. So, I picked up a pack of both tonight.  It pours with a very hazy golden honey color, when backlit, there is a very light orange tinge. Some very small deleterious matter and floaties, probably from my impatience at wanting to try one of these as soon as I got home. The haze is mainly due to the fact that it is bottle-conditioned, but it did not bother me in the least. Massive carbonation when poured, gives the head a voluminous appearance. A mass of tightly packed, off-white fluffy bubbles. The head lacerates the sides with a stiff whippy crust.  Pineo-trolic resinous nose with a fresh grass stain odor are quite inviting.  Sharp citric beginnings at first, raw hops assault me in the middle of this beer but lead to a softer grassy finish. Not that bitter, more of aggressive grassy stain with a side salad of freshly plucked hops plants. The head dies down as I near the end of the beer.  Nice IPA! Hmmm, I like this a lot, very drinkable, time to have another bottle!  Well, TJs Chapattis are absolutely crap  my Curry was absolutely superb (pat on back), and the DFH 60-min IPA was an excellent accompaniment to this Anglo-Ameri-Indian dish. Only $5.99 for 6 x 12fl.oz. Bottles  What a Bargain!!

Finally got a chance to try it and found it thoroughly enjoyable. Liked the hazy orange color and the firm head and found the smell to be both strong and pleasing. Best of all, the earthy, hoppy bite of the product was what I would expect from a top IPA yet that aspect of trhe flavor profile wasn't so dominant as to unbalance the product. No unusual aftertaste.

10099,6108,Edwin,4.6,"Served up nicely with an orange haze look to it. Nice, white head. The aroma was incredible, as you can smell the hops, and a hint of fruit that to me resembles apricot or a citrus variety. The taste was very good. Has a bit of a kick to it, but also a smooth, hoppy fruit flavor going down. Carbonated, but also easy to drink. Just an all-around great beer with great characteristics and flavor.

Having already had the 90-minute, I thought I got that bier and that the bier-menu at the pub had a typo. Oh well, nbd....  The bottle version pours a hazy, medium-golden color, though there's no residue at the bottom. Must just be naturally cloudy, providing the little chunkies I espied floating within. Head was bright white and quite fluffy to begin. It soon dissipated into a thin, fine layer of bubbles, and left some attractive lacing in the glass.  The nose was fairly heavy on the hops, somewhat citrussy, but with a slight sharpness as well. A bit of toasty malt also was present, yet was definitely playing second fiddle to the hops.  Medium body as well as smoothness combined for a ""good"" mouthfeel. A bit of carbonation gave the feel a bubbly, foaminess.  A bready, slightly toasty, malt character was the base upon which was built this house of hops. A big, floral, earthy combo of hop flavors dominated, and stuck long and hard in the throat for what seemed like forever! This is quite flavorful, and it grew on me the more I quaffed it.

10099,6108,Jarod,4.47,"Bottled in February 2003 Continually hopped, bottle conditioned Label has a collage of fresh hops all over it.  This beer poured a golden color that was slightly opaque but carbonation was noticeable. The head that was created was white in color and the texture was creamy, sticky, thick, foamy, dense, and long lasting. It left good lace behind, spotty in areas but over all nice. The aromas that came from the glass were of fresh hop leaves (cascade I believe), floral hops, citrus, sweet malt, caramel, fresh grass, pine needles and a slight bread dough. Mostly hops but as the temperature rose slightly the other aromas became noticeable along with the hops. The flavors that rolled across my tongue were of hops  slight bitter, floral, citrus  fresh and dried hop leaves, fresh cut grass on a warm thick Saturday morning, sweet malts, caramel, pine needles, lemons and grapefruits, alcohol and bread. The after tastes were of fresh hops and slightly bitter when first pulled from the fridge and tasted, it got progressively creamier and sweeter as it got warmer, but still hopped. I would say that the flavors of this beer are 94.5% hops and 5.5% everything else. If there be truth in labeling then this beer should be called 45 minute IPA because I swear it took 45 minutes for the hop taste to finally leave my tongue. Even when I exhaled I tasted hops. Amazing. Very good beer, another hit from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The aroma is an absolutely tantalizing floral smell, backed by a nice malt sweetness. The taste is smooth, and suprisingly balanced. The first thing that I noticed was the malt backgorund, but it is supporting a heavy load of hops. Nice, even bitterness throughout with a bit of a piney-citrus note. A wisp of sweetness licks the tongue on the aftertaste, but the hops steal the show. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, with perfect carbonation. The carbonation is integrated so well into the overall experience I had to think about the carbonation. I love when that happens. This beer is supremely drinkable, and I must get a lot more of this soon.

10099,6108,Riggo,3.87,"The green label is appropriate for this one, considering the smell and taste of this IPA is pure green. Fresh, fresh hops slapping you in the face. Is this a good thing? Decide for yourself. (Incidentally, the bottle i sampled was bottled in January. I first tasted a bottle of the same bottling date in late March and was just so turned off by the greenness and lack of roundedness that I let it lay in my fridge for about a month in the hopes that it would round out a little, and it did.)  Pours a hazy golden color with a sturdy off-white head. Good head retention with moderate lacing. The nose on this one is intense. Almost an ammonia-like intensely spicy, peppery nose of leafy hops, pine sap, cut grass, and mint. Some slight pineapple notes, though mostly its green, green, green. On palate, sharp, grassy hops and any other green, leafy, vegetal or herbal thing you can think of: pine needles, bitter greens like frisee or broccoli rabe, herbs. Uniquely, this brew is very heavy on hop flavor and yet not overly bitter (apparently this is achieved through a process called ""continual-hopping""). But the intensity of these ""green"" flavors has an almost gasoline-like quality. Some fruit elements struggle to come forward--orange and tangy lemon. Some slight woodiness. Finish is long and bitter, with a chalky dryness. A nice smooth and chewy mouthfeel. To me the drinkability suffers from the too -intense and sharp flavors.  I was pulling for this one. It sounded interesting but this whole sharp ""green"" thing is just not appealing to me. Perhaps some more aging will improve the character of this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,MJR,4.47,"Appearance: Pours a glowing copper with a touch of sediment haze. An off-white head starts out decent enough, then shrinks down to a small cap. It laces the glass wonderfully.  Smell: The aroma is extremely fresh smelling with a ton of hop character. The hops come across as green and fragrant. Lots of pine resin, citrus, and floral scents. This brew is the little brother to their 90 Minute IPA and I can definitely recognize the link.  Taste: The flavor has a smooth, but piercing, bitterness that is strong from start to finish. But it's not the hop bitterness that's the star here...it's the hop flavor. This brew is packed with it: pine, citrus, floral, grapefruit...very nice! There's a hint of caramelly malt hiding underneath the hops, but it's merely there in a supporting role. It does get a bit stronger towards the end though. Strangely enough, the alcohol taste is stronger than the 6% would make you believe.  Mouthfeel: Medium in thickness with a smooth, rounded mouthfeel that ends with a touch of alcoholic dryness.  Drinkability: Damn good...this is quite the tasty IPA! I love their 90 Minute IPA, and this is almost as good. More please...  On a side note, I have noticed that this beer differs from batch to batch. The last sixer I had screamed 'Ringwood yeast!' This review is from an earlier batch.

It just reeks (literally) of green, grassy, spicy, minty, hops. Obviously, with a 60-min. addition, the whole spectrum of the hop is taken care of, bitterness, flavor, aroma, no gaps. I won't say it's nicely balanced, but there's enough going on otherwise to keep it going. A little yeast bite actually gets through , too.

10099,6108,NeroFiddled,4.46,"The bottle pours a yellow-gold body with a light orange cast. It's quite hazy, but then again, it is bottle conditioned and loaded with hops. The case advertises that with the funny line, ""New Chunky Style""! There was no yeast left at the bottom of the bottle so I assume that with some longer cold storage it might clear a bit. It brings up a creamy off-white head which drops to a thin surface covering; holds well throughout the glass; and leaves some thin lace. But the aroma is brilliant! It's just like opening a large bag of fresh whole flower hops - pungent, grassy, floral, lightly minty and a touch citrusy. In the mouth it's medium body and fine, natural carbonation combine to gently caress the tongue before warming to become creamy and smooth. A rich malt balances the hop flavors nicely, and the bitterness is solid but well within reason. It starts with a bright note of lightly sweet, citric, floral, and leafy/grassy hops; followed by some more earthy/minty/resinous (but not quite piney) flavors as it crosses the palate; and finishes with an incredibly long-standing fresh hop flavor and a muted, drying bitterness that rises as the residual malts receed. Overall, it's quite soft and round, avoiding the brash character of many ""Imperial"" IPA's; and it's alcohol is also well concealed within it's big flavor and aroma. Very nicely done with a surprising amount of drinkability. Well worth trying!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91

The earthy, grassy, floral hops smell awesome. It poured out a golden color with an orange tint, with a surprisingly impressive white head that didn't last very long.  The flavors of this delicious brew are all in excellent balance. Obviously, the generous amount of hops are what make this beer what it is, but it all comes together so well with a mild malt flavor and a bit of sweet fruitiness. Lightly carbonated on the tongue, finishes with a nice hop character and a little sweetness. An awesome IPA, and definitely my favorite as of yet from Dogfish Head.

Its like sticking your nose near a bag of fresh hops. Unabashedly floral, fresh, and grassy.I cant get enough of the smell. After the first few sips, which are full-force hops, this beer really does mellow out. Malt shines through in the mid-taste. You get the doughy yeastiness of the bottle conditioning. Its really remarkable to get so much flavor though the onslaught of hops. Very well done. Drinkable, and extremely enjoyable.

This is a prelude of things to come.  Upon tasting, it starts slightly sweet and becomes a wave of mild bitterness, followed by a wonderfully moderate hop flavor that is well balanced with hints of carmel sweetness. Really a creamy beer. It finishes quite smooth.  Yes... I could drink this beer all night... if I didn't need more hops! Time to drink a 90 minute IPA?!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,ElGuapo,4.27,"A crystal clear golden orange sitting under a pillow of white foam that hangs out there for a while. Aggressive hop aroma mixed with grass.  It is very floral and spicy. It is not simply overloaded with hops, but it does have quite a bit of hop presence to say the least. The hops hit hard and then balance to near perfection with pale malts and a bit of bread as it dries out toward the finish. It starts crisp, and I would like it to stay that way, but the carbonation dies as soon as it hits your tongue. This is one I could have a few of, but it may be hard for anti-hopheads to handle. A fine brew in my book.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Bighuge,4.62,"The appearance is a hazy orange tinted amber in color. A thin wispy ivory white head recedes to a thin film that sticks around for a while. The lacing is a bit truncated, but nice eye candy nonetheless. The aroma is very exotic. It's musty. Smoky. Medicinal, in a good way. And naphthalene-like. (Reminds me of the mothball smell in my Grandma's attic.) Very unique and very nice for an IPA. This beer seems to have a somewhat harsh bitterness, but it's appealing to me. And it's different from your West Coast variety of IPAs (which are great in their own right.) First and foremost, I really do dig the bitterness of this one. After I cut through that, I get to a level of flavors I'm not totally used to in IPAs, but are very nice. For instance, there is a nice minty aspect. And also a coarse pepper-like presence. It's spicy as hell. The malt base is sufficient for a backing, but not real distinctive in any way. Makes no difference. IPAs are all about the hops and this IPA throws out a unique perspective of what can be attained from the almighty flower.  Many thanks to the Almighty Shit for this sample. Thanks for the effort Senior.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,francisweizen,4.36,"An excellent bottle-conditioned-IPA from Dogfish Head. This beer pours a very nice hazy amber colour with a small white head. The aromas are of citrus, hops, hops, malts, and some more hops. The taste is very hoppy as well, and very dry too. The hops are not very bitter and this beer is very subdued when compared to DFH's 90 minute IPA. This beer has a very creamy and smooth mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. The drinkability is off-the-hook for this one, the perfect session beer! Cheers to DFH for finally putting this out in bottles!, F.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,scottum,4.5,"Golden amber with a nice head. Sooooooooooo smooooooooooth! Hoppy as an IPA should be. Not as over the top as the 90 minute. Very well balanced. A bit of a citrus bitter is in there with a nice dry malty taste. Certainly, any IPA fan should try this brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,RonfromJersey,4.52,"Bottle conditioned. Orange chill-hazed body with tiny, sporadic carbonation. A hefty solid white head, which leaves excellent lace.  Strong fresh and clean citric aroma.  Malt backbone is quickly and heavily covered up by the grapefruit and lemon hop zing. The hop assault is not too over the top however. Balance might not be the best word, but it's not the punch in the nose of Hop Infusion or Stone Ruinination. There is an overall sense of freshness . Nice lingering aftertaste.  Recommended, and my choice for a DFH flagship brew. I'll have to revisit this soon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,yen157,3.67,"Good, but not great.  My bottle was kept and served a little too cool so I had to let it sit for a bit. It started out pretty ugly. The beer itself was a very cloudy light amber orange, but the hazy lifted significantly as the beer warmed up. The head was coarse and quickly reduced to wisps. The first flavor that jumped out at my wasnt hop related but rather a faint smokiness. Besides that, there werent any surprises. Wood and grapefruit aromas dominate the nose as well as the palate. As one would expect, the hop bitterness is more restrained in this one and the emphasis is more on the other aspects of the H. lupulus. The role in the malt cut back as well. I think I like the 90 minute IPA better, because IMO this played more like a West Coast PA because of the thinner body and malt contribution.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,beerluvr,3.85,"Pours out with a rich, thick head of white foam, settling over clear golden liquid. The nose is intense hoppiness, not the usual grapefruity Cascade aroma, but dare I say an almost spicy ""skunk-bud""-type of aroma...not the light-struck type skunkiness though. Taste is nicely bitter without being overwhelmingly bitter. Notes of maltiness back things up sufficiently. A slight biscuity character appears here as well. Smooth mouthfeel. Finishes with a bitterness that fades quickly to a malty taste. Kudos to the D.H. brewery for this quaffable ale.  The most balanced out of the 60/90/120 Min. series, IMO.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,goindownsouth,4.5,"This could very well be, without further research, my favorite IPA thusfar. A very appealing IPA-type golden-amber color appeals to me from the get-go. The aroma is all that I expect from a top-notch IPA. Spicey and hoppy at the nose, but the smell is just the beginning.  The taste is something almost god-like. It is hoppy and spicey. Almost fruity, but without taking that next all-too-fruity-step.  In ever lightly lacey head i sappealing, but I am thinking flavor and aroma all the way. A great beer to try, but beware. Hopheads only need apply. A very good brew. Prost!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,WanderingFool,4.65,"Being a big fan of IPA's I found a six pack of 60 minute IPA last week and just had to give it a try. It pours a hazy yellow color with a thin white head that fades fast, but leaves a decent amount of lace on the glass. The aroma is very strong mixture of citrus (mostly grapefruit) and pine. Each sip begins hoppy and quickly moves to a citrus flavor with a toasted malt background. It finishes with a mild bitterness that lingers for a while before the next sip.  If you like hoppy IPA's I highly recommend this one. I didn't find it as bitter as other brands and felt it was quite drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,goz,3.8,"Bottled. Pour is slightly cloudy ornage golden, big pure-white head, strongly clinging lace. Aroma is citrus hops, slightly sweet maltiness, grassy, some herbal tones. Flavor is lightly malty to start, then some herbal/grassy notes, then bitter and citrus from the hops. Medium body, hints of spiciness, medium carbonation, and good lasting flavors.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Dantes,3.65,"Package: 12 oz. bottle. Label scored between 1 & 2; 6% ABV. Bottle-conditioned.  Cost: $8.49 a 6-pack @ King&#8217;s  Presentation: Imperial pint glass at ~45º  Appearance: A medium-vigorous pour resulted in ¾&#8221; of white head at best, which quickly receded to a thin film. Body was a lovely, rich golden yellow color. Apparently robust carbonation resulted in streams of medium-gauge bubbles. Mostly clear, with several &#8220;floaters.&#8221;  Smell: Hops assaulted my nose like the Allies on Omaha Beach. At first, the sensation was unpleasant; but as I acclimated, I could begin to differentiate the sensations of mentholated pine, citrus, and new-mown grass.  Taste: The taste was like the aroma squared. Unfortunately, this meant that the hops were even more dominant. Whatever elements of malt, grain, and fruitiness (other than grapefruit) present were lost on me. The immediate taste is pleasant, but it quickly turns overly bitter and medicinal. Even as it warmed further, not much developed in the middle of the palate or on the finish. Made me think of club soda with hop oil extract and a lemon twist.  Mouthfeel: The high level of carbonation apparent during the pour translated to a fairly coarse, rough texture in the mouth, unrelieved by any roundness from malt complexity. A bit watery and brittle.  Drinkability: I think this would benefit from being served older and colder. Not unpleasant, but not something for which I couldn&#8217;t find several better alternatives.  I overpaid for this because I like to patronize King&#8217;s so that they will continue to cater to me. If this were $6.99 like the HopDevil (as in other outlets), it would be more competitive. It is hoppier than the HopDevil, but not as complex or ultimately satisfying. I preferred the 90 Minute IPA, if only because it offered much more than a Hop Hit upfront, but is less drinkable because of its ABV. I will probably put 2 aside to test its aging potential.  Bottom Line: A one trick pony. The second bottle did pair well with pepperoni pizza however, which tamed its hoppy profile. Would probably make a very refreshing beer if served cold on a hot, summer day.  5/10/03: Much improved. Better head and smoother carbonation, with a much more harmonious flavor profile. Fruitier, maltier and much more enjoyable. As a bottle-conditioned ale, it'll probably be even better at 6 months. Obviously too green through initial 4 bottles.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,avylover,4.5,"Nice golden yellow brew with a slight haze to it. Small white foamy head. Smell is very hoppy with a good whiff of barley in there. The citrous zing of the hops is definitely there, followed by the taste of freshly harvested grains. (wheat or barley? can't say i've ever tried either). This is very tasty considering the lower ABV, and I prefer this to the 90 minute IPA because you can put 'em down all night without getting wasted. There is more taste in this brew than any 6% beer i've had, making this the ultimate session brew. Good full mouthfeel, with a nice dry finish.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Jdiddy,5,"Holy mother! This is hands down the best IPA I have ever had the peasure of drinking. While I was not very impressed with the 90 Minute IPA, the 60 Minute IPA is simply superb. Amazing pine hop smell that is possibly the best smelling beer ever. Nice orange creamy pour with a slight head. Beautiful hop taste that I believe is pretty bitter (although others do not find it very bitter). After tasting this, it will be hard to ever find another IPA as good. Also, I NEVER give a beer a 5 all the way around and this one gets it for sure. Perfect beer!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,Darkale,4.35,"If ever there was a beer that proved, for me at least, the rule that you should always check a beer twice before deciding that you don't like it, 60 Minute IPA is it. My first one last night was not an impressive experience. Today -- chagrined by the high reviews, wondering what I missed last night -- I popped open another, and found myself far more pleased than I had been. In fact, this has become one of my favorite IPAs.  The aroma is definitely piney; one would think the brewers had put a spruce branch through a juice extractor. Great, billowing, ""never say die"" head, and lacing that looks like it's trying to crawl up the inside of the glass.  Chewy mouthfeel, nice and creamy, great hops taste, nicely balanced with malt sweetness. This is a good beer, it makes you work for it, and unlike so many milder IPAs, every sip seems different, if only because you can choose to focus on a different aspect of its complexity every time.  Who knows what was wrong with my taste buds last night? I am just glad that I gave this beer another try. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,OldFrothingSlosh,4.3,"Presentation: 12oz. amber bottle. Packaged in January '03. $8.19/6-pack at Carytown W&B.  Appearance: Poured a hazy golden color with lots and lots of bubbles. Very thick and rocky head lasts and lasts, coating the glass in distinct rings and the glass emptied.  Smell: Very hoppy, with citrus and pine aromas dominating. Skulking in the background is a bit of caramel sweetness. Very nice.  Taste: Much more balanced than the big brother of the family, the 90-minute IPA. The hops are very nicely complemented by the sweetness of the malts. Very, very smooth. Personally, I like the flavor of the 90-minute IPA a little more. But not by much.  Mouthfeel: Wonderful oily coating on the lips with this beer. Fairly high amount of carbonation. Smooth and creamy.  Drinkability: So smooth and easy to drink. Very easy on the palate. No problems finishing this one. Not a disproportionately-hopped beer. Crisp and clean finish. Ranks just slightly behind its big brother.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,WVbeergeek,4.47,"I have had the 90 minute IPA on cask and it is my favorite IPA in the world, so when I saw the little bro on cask at the Sharp Edge I couldn't turn it down. Appears a copper hue with a tannish biege, silky smooth head. Very nice full foam, with lace adhesion going in in my pint glass. The aroma is a full upfront floral hop aroma with citrus and pine tones, very nice malty complement going on here. A well balanced hop and malt combo make up this very refreshing appetizing session IPA. Very smooth on cask and not too hoppy, due to the fact that enough malt sweetness crashes upon the palate to tame the bitterness. A pronounced piney hop character, amazing offering from the folks at Dogfish Head. Smooth and creamy almost feels as smooth as if it were on nitro, with a medium to light body, a worthwhile beer!! Very smooth and drinkable welcome to paradise my fellow hopheads.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,zerk,4.5,"Had this on tap at Chalkies recently... what a great IPA this is! Clear and copper with a thin but persistent white head. Leaves rings of lace all the way down the glass. Has a sweet citrusy aroma with some buscuit and caramel mixed in. Flavor begins sweet, a mixture of maltiness and sweet hop oil, then becomes fruity, with orange and grapefruit notes, and finishes bitter. The balance of flavors is exquisite. Medium body and carboantion... smooth and slightly oily mouthfeel. This might be as close as you can get to a session IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
10099,6108,HopheadEd,4.37,"On tap, it's very different than bottled, bigger head, more aroma. Good golden, slightly orange color, and a good mouthfeel. A bit of a bite with the hops, but still not over powering. The finish for me was smooth and creamy, well balanced with a good hop aftertaste. Excellent beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American IPA,91
