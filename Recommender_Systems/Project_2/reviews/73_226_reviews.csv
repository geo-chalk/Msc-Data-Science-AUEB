73,226,Siriusfisherman,4.5,"Pours a clear black/brown with glints of red. On top is a foamy tan head with good lacing. Notes of caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, coffee and herbal hops round out the nose. The flavor is smooth and rich for a brew that is surprisingly light on the palate. Hop flavor and bitterness is subdued and the malt really shines with warm caramel and chocolate flavors. Medium bodied with a crisp finish. Overall, I guess I am a little taken aback as I always thought this was more of a big, robust porter from hearing about it. In reality it is a much more quaffable, session-able take on the style than I always thought. Much like great lake's lagers, the level and complexity of the beers malt flavor is much more than one would typically find. This is a very refined, drinkable, and delicious dark beer. Definitely deserving of being compared to Deschutes Black Butte, Sierra Nevada Porter, and other classics.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,KGT426,4.79,I have a tough time finding this beer in Missouri. But I think one of the best porters I have ever tried.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,kp7,4.23,"Updated with review in March, 2023.  Format and age: 12oz bottle gifted, best by April 22, 2023.  Cold chain: somewhat unknown. Transported cold after receiving it and kept in fridge at home.  Impressions: pours very dark brown with red edges and a one-finger tan head. Aromas of chocolate and roast coffee dominate. The taste starts with a big kick of bitter chocolate that sweetens as it lingers in the mouth. Progresses to notes of dark roast coffee and burnt toast with some dark fruit on the finish and aftertaste. As it warms, the dark fruits come out more while the bitter and burnt characteristics recede a bit. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, resulting in a smooth feel.  Overall: a great porter. Great Lakes did a good job keeping the bitterness in check while retaining that quintessential porter profile and making it more thab just a roast bomb. Definitely my favorite since having Everett quite a few years ago now.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,vainosuomi,3.88,"L: Creamy tan head, very dark coffee brown color S: Dark chocolate, coffee, toasted malt, faint floral notes T: Starts out sweeter than the smell might suggest with caramel and sweet toasted bread. Chocolate notes again that finish into a dark chocolate / floral hop bitterness. F: Medium body and carbonation, creamy, slightly astringent.  A very good porter. The sweet toasted malt mask a significant hoppy bitterness rather well",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,DrOfGolf,4.16,Another one in a care package from my Brother from Ohio. What a Great Guy.  The beer poured a very dark brownish-black color with a tan colored head. The smell is of coffee and chocolate. The taste is the same as the smell. This was a really good beer that I look forward to drinking again.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,JokersAce,4.39,"Dark brown that coalesces to black in the pour with a small beige head. Maybe because it's really cold. Barley malt aroma with some slight licorice profile. Smoky malts taste with plentiful of burnt caramel, dark chocolate, coffee bean, tobacco. Pleasant aftertaste that reminds of the complex profile without being cloying. Decent mouthfeel in being carbonated and not overly thick. Very good and enjoyable porter with rich complexity.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,TimDixon1964,4.24,Just a bit too much bitter coffee taste on the palate compared to other Porters I enjoy. Still a high quality brew!,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,tradershmulie,3.68,"Pours nicely, decent head that stuck around a bit. Color is rather thin and see through. Smooth, easy to drink.  Good beer, adequate for the price and style, but nothing special.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,elNopalero,4.52,"A classic of the style. Roasty, with lots of coffee and dark chocolate notes. Hits the spots and then some. That's what makes it a classic of the style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,crazyspicychef,4.19,"A pretty solid example of a Porter, but there's something amiss that I can't pinpoint that without this would be top notch. It may be a bit heavy on the black malt, too much hops? Not sure. Still, better than most out there. I'll stick to my Yuengling Porter. Easier drinking.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,hman43,4.19,"Look: It pours very dark brown with a tan head. Head retention is very good.  Smell: It has chocolate aromas with some roast and coffee notes.  Taste: It has roasted and coffee flavors up front with chocolate notes mixed it. There is a bit of sweetness to it.  Feel: It have a medium body with a bitter finish.  Overall, this is a simple beer with flavors, but they work incredibly well together.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jonphisher,4.03,"Beautiful deep dark and clear brown, a dense light brown head that persists; great lacing.  Nose has subtle dark cherry note, some cocoa and weak coffee, woody smell.  Taste has the same dark fruit twang, bitter dark chocolate; nice roast and almost smokey note lingers in the after taste.  Medium body, soft smooth carbonation, nice roast driven bitterness, dry finish.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,hbeimers,4.17,"The most noticable thing about this to me is the complexity in the flavor. Immediately it gives a lot of coffee and roasted flavors, and it lasts with a strong lingering bitterness. In some ways it almost tastes more bitter than a lot of IPAs owing to the burnt character. Very tasty.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,KT3418,4.25,"Might be some recency bias but this is easily the best porter I've had since Capella by Ecliptic, to name one. Super dark, basically opaque but not all the way, delicious robust malty flavor. This lived up to my expectation",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jackflaps,4.46,"Poured into glass from bottle.  L: Very dark, almost stout-colored, with smallish/moderate head.  S: Roasty, a little bit of coffee note.  T: Same as the nose, but with a little more sweetness in the mix. Fades to bitterness in the end.  F: Soft and smooth.  O: The standard against which I measure every other porter I drink. Classic.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,minstrelwb,4.27,"The beer to give to a friend that only drinks Bud. Good beer, just doesn't pop like many of the newer beers.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Peach63,4.25,"Pours mahogany with a 1.5"" tan head, which lasts. Heavy lacing.  Aroma is coffee, roast malt, cocoa nibs.  Taste follows nose: Coffee, roast malt, cocoa.  Medium body, light carbonation. Dry finish.  This is a classic Porter. Good across the board.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Hayesbro,4.28,"Close to black with a dark brown head. Roasty aroma, and the taste is roasty malts for miles, a little touch of sourness on the top and a lasting bitterness on the back. Medium body, decently creamy mouthfeel. Very good for a porter you can find anywhere.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,detgfrsh,4.37,From a bottle. Very dark brown with a half inch of light brown head. Roasted malt and vanilla smell. Full bodied. Roasted malt and coffee flavors with a little vanilla. Excellent,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,walser,4.19,"From the bottle into an 8oz drinking glass. Look is stout-like, dark porter. Smell is mild, light coffee stout but with something benevolently evasive. Flan? Taste is sweeter than a pale ale but with some hoppy-happyness. Feel is very smooth, silky. Overall, takes a second glance - kind of eases into you like the shortish female with the good personailty, without big curves, not obnoxious but bright, who people are not paying all that much attention to and then later, away from the noise, you realize she is maybe the most attractive woman, with incredibly complimentary features, you have seen in months, if not years. Nice brew.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,LesDewitt4beer,4.49,"12oz bottle into a nonic pint glass. L: Pours dark brown with light ruby edges. Has a frothy pock-marked robust 2.5"" tan head that has excellent retention. Abundant sticky lacing and banding. No visible carbonation. S: Dark chocolate, caramel, heavily toasted malts, raisins, lightly floral. T: Raisins, figs, dark soda bread, a fair amount of bitter dark chocolate, dark toasted malts, light char, light citrus zest at the top of the palate. F: This superior tasting porter retains a brisk, fresh, soft medium bodied mouthfeel that is smooth and creamy. It's right in the middle and has a beautiful texture that is luxurious. It is lightly drying. O: Extremely well balanced and crafted, full flavored and facilitating with tangible earth flavors. This American Porter is agreeably world-class in it's style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,magikbagel,3.65,One of the first porters I can say I thoroughly enjoyed. Its very well balanced and very crushable for the style.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Kiiz,4.77,The best 6er for 10 or less hands down. Kinda wish it wasn’t my first craft beer bc it set the bar way too high. World class indeed.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,HardWied,4.64,"Deep syrupy smell with a hint of coffee and chocolate and licorice. I like carbonation and this delivers, every sip is accompanied with a crisp punch. Before I evaluate the flavors I experience the carbonation and I like that. Pours nicely into a glass. Dark body with creamy head and smoky flavor. I'm honestly surprised this is best in style bc I just picked it up randomly. FORTUNE FAVORS THE BOLD. This is a good beer, drink and be well.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Davidstan,4.22,"I don’t like porters overly but this one I can tell is well crafted and tasty. Roasted cocoa, coffee and slight hop and malt profile make this a winner. Best ever for me",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Raislak,4.38,"Did a room temperature bottle, poured into a pint glass. Initial pour generated 3/4 head that was auburn at bottom gradually working to light tan at top. Resembled a cherry cola. Taste was very smooth, no heavy carbonation and a bit bitter (not unlike the bittersweet history it named after). Smell had coco and coffee notes and am enjoying this even though I'm not normally a fan of bitter things. Glad I made the extra stop to pick this up!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BJB13,3.85,"12 ounce bottle poured into a tumbler style pint glass.  Dark brown with ruby highlights, one finger khaki head fades to a ring in about a minute. Nose is roasted malt and coffee. Taste is the same with the addition of bitter chocolate. Medium body, opens crisp but is soft and creamy. Decent.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,HoppingMadMonk,4.28,"Solid cola brown appearance. Body is at least medium with just under average carbonation. Overall it has a nice feel. Aroma is roasted malt, milk and dark bakers chocolate, black coffee, some raisins and dark fruit. Taste is everything I would want from a porter. Some coffee grind bitterness with dark chocolate, dark fruit and roasted malt and black coffee. This is totally worth a try. I often forget how good it is then I buy a six pack to remind myself. Another great beer from great lakes",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Singlefinpin,4.13,"Drinking this at home. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Drink by date 07/17/21 today 5/11/21 Looks dark brown almost black with a nice tan foamy head that dropped to a thick cap. Smells malty, sweet, bready, chocolate, spicy. Taste follows the nose nicely with enough spiciness to keep my interest. Mouth feel is medium for the style with a nice creamy finish. Overall a very fine Porter that just might be my new go to Porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,HopHunterCL,4.55,"Pours a very dark brown with a finger and a half of light brown head. Aroma is incredible. Roasted, nutty, earthy, slightly smoky. Tastes of dark bread, chocolate, finishes dry and slightly bitter. Medium body smooth mouthfeel with good carbonation. A superb porter. I should be drinking this more often.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,klarcbarr3,4.39,"A strong pour into a 16 oz. glass yields a 1.5 inch, medium brown head. The aroma is superb.. a roasted, carmelized nuttiness outshines the sweet chocolatey notes, but the most exceptional scent is a smokey, salty, atmosperic freshness that oddly enough, smells like you are on a large, fresh water lake or coastal river.. earthy, but not oceanic. The head dissipates but remains strong enough to lace the glass nicely all the way down as you proceed. Although the mouthfeel is slightly thin, the taste is subtle, complex, yet refreshingly clean. The chocolate and coffee notes are forefront, but that smokey malty salted breeze is still in the mix.. this is a killer porter! There may be another American Porter or two better than this, but it seems unlikely while you are drinking one of these. One of my long term, go-to, everyday drinker all-time faves! It seems even more relevant now that I have moved onto a Michigan Island in the Great Lakes system, and can look at Canada across the Detroit River. The Great Lakes are awesome, and this brew is aptly appropriate.. get yourself an Edmund Fitzgerald Great Lakes Porter!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,MNAle,3.93,"Restrained aroma, but I pick up sweetness, chocolate, some (but not much) roasted malts.  Deep dark brown color, with dark red revealed with a back-light along with ample carbonation. 1½ inch tall, thick, tan head with very good retention, leaving rings of lacing as it recedes.  Very nice flavor. Raisins, coffee, chocolate, and a little spice. As with the aroma, very mild roasted malts. No bitterness at all (well, a little in the aftertaste as the beer warms). Slightly sweet initially, which carries through to the finish. The finish is sweetish with a bit of spiciness.  Mouth feel is appropriately moderately thin, creamy though, with at least a little carbonation feel.  Overall, a well done traditional American porter. Great Lakes keeps to the basics with this one, and I appreciate that. The light spiciness is a good touch. Easy drinking and enjoyable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,mikeinportc,4.29,"Best By date : 6/9/21 . Let sit out for ~5 minutes before opening.  Dark mahogany-brown, with one finger+ of tan head.  Smells of nutty,roasty malt, with slight aromas of cocoa and damp/earthy decaying wood.  Taste is all of the elements in the aroma, plus a bit of cola. Moderate drying bitterness.  Feel is initially creamy, with some light,soft carbonation burn/bite coming in near finish.  Overall, a pleasant, easy-drinking classic . :) The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,JRybacki,4,"Just picked this up after watching a local beer show called 'What's Brewing"" Poured from a 12oz bottle into pilsner glass. Thin head (one-finger) formed on the pour, with some lacing on the glass. Head died down quickly. Color is more amber-brown and somewhat clearer than other porters. Aroma is bitter and roasty. Taste is also bitter, but not overdone, and ends up tingling on your tongue. There is some sweetness on the back end. Mouthfeel is light and crisp- reminds me of a black ipa but more subtle with all that good bitterness running through out. Well done.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,UristMcBrewer,4.17,"The beer is dark but transparent. When held to the light is red and is otherwise black. There is a tan head and then lace. On the nose, it is very rich. There are coffee and chocolatey notes as well as a bit of green from the hops and hints of tea. The taste is roasty and sweet with noticeable spicy hops. The mouthfeel is divine. The carbonation evolves in your mouth provided just the right amount of tactile stimulation. The body is very thick and velvety. It washes over your mouth as a thick evolving foam. Overall, this is a nice beer after a long day.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,German-Helles,4.45,"This is a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. This was a perfect pour! two fingers of tan foam that slowly settled back to a nice tan cap and plenty of lacing left behind. This porter is a nice dark color, when held up to a light there is a red hue that pokes through. This is way to dark to take notice of any carbonation. The aroma is very nice and noticeable from the moment it is opened. Sweet roasted malts! I can hardly wait to sample this one. The sip starts on the dry side, slightly bitter, then finishes with the sweet roasted malt that hits the nose at the beginning. There is a roasted coffee flavor with sweet cocoa nibs, it is just a nice combination. As this porter warms the dryness seems a little less noticeable. The feel is very smooth the carbonation is really a non factor. I picked up a sixer and went back and picked up another a couple of days later. This is a very enjoyable porter and Great Lakes Brewery tends to have extremely fair pricing in this area. If you like porters, I think this is a good one to sample. You will not be disappointed.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jkh15,3.76,Smelled great but the taste was lacking. Very warm and tasty on the front end and surprisingly bitter on the back of my tongue. Would drink again.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,milkshakebeersucks,4.29,"Attractive looking beer; deep brown body, large tan head and very good lacing. Dark malt aroma, roasty, along side chocolate and chicory. Earthy flavor.

Full bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,laquebrada,3.71,"Small brownish head when poured from 12 oz. bottle. Opaque dark brown color, aroma of anise, chocolate, cinnamon, roasted malt. Flavor is like a bitter dark chocolate with a hints of fish and metal. Finish favors the bitter side. Good body, not over attenuated or over carbonated. While it is an interesting beer, it has some weirdness to it. Possibly not the best sample, will try it fresh next time I visit OH.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,NYNorseman,4.23,Drinking this takes me back several years as I was driving to Cleveland from NY with a few friends for the Christmas Story 5k in a white knuckle snowstorm. I remember finally pulling into Great Lakes Brewing and drinking a Christmas Ale and one of these as I let the stress and tension melt off me! I have always liked this beer but I did a double take as I looked at the World Class rating here. I was a bit surprised but this is a very good example of a porter. I thought my attachment to it might be sentimental but I guess others agree. Definitely a perfect beer when the gales of November come early!,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,NCSapiens,4.01,"I’ve had this in the bottle numerous times, but just had on draft for the first time and it was much more interesting. Pours a nearly black color with ample light beige foam. The aroma is mostly water and faint malts. The taste is roasted malts and clove. Perhaps some mild hops. It isn’t sweet but there is an aftertaste reminiscent of cola or Dr Pepper. Creamy feel is excellent, yet still light as expected of a porter. Overall this is quite enjoyable, and one led to four or five, and suddenly in an inebriated state I declared that this is great.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ChristopherCurtis,4.75,"Appearance: Coca-cola color, soapy light tan head. Nice retention on that head there, wo buddy Smell: Burnt toast, fresh coffee beans, cocoa powder, hershey bars. Taste: Like the smell only amped up. Medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, black bread, some dark fruit. Caramel and cocoa powder aftertaste. pretty damn good Feel: Chewy. Medium bodied.

73,226,keith_katt,4.02,"This beer pours dark brown with a 1"" light brown head that disappears to thick lacing in a few minutes. Held up to the light it is very red. The smell is a touch of bread and black licorice. Maybe a little bit of cream. Fairly strong carbonation with a light mouth feel for a porter. The flavor is complex: caramel, lightly bitter, followed by blackberries at the end. There is something in there that reminds me of root beer, I think it is clove. This is available at my local store, but it may be worth the trip to Cleveland to try it on tap from the source.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,PathofChaos,4.43,"Appearance: A deep carmine enveloped by shadows. Appears black... but when held aloft and illuminated it shines red, like a ruby scorched by dragon’s fire. The head is a pale khaki that hovers atop like a ghostly, volcanic plume. A single ring of lace is all you get from its briefly retained plumage.  Bouquet: A relaxing aroma of lightly smoked malts, roasted black walnuts and toffee that’s been stretched thin.  Feel: A hefted medium that’s thick and creamy. Yet it slides so slick, it comes across deceptively light. This welcome deception is further enhanced by how tame and unobtrusive the carbonation is. Finishes with delicate, malt dryness.  Taste: A slice of soft, buttered pumpernickel bread, browned malts, and a dozy, unsweetened caramel coffee. Each flavor becomes more distinct as the porter airs and shifts from cold to chilled. Leaves a gentle wake of hop spiciness after each sip.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,BeerBaronBear,4.46,"Picked up a bottle as part of a $11 mixed 6-pack from my local grocery store. For the price, this one's an absolute winner! Porters can be hit or miss for me, but this one hits on all cylinders. My only ding would be that a 10% heavier body would be nice - it's on the lighter side and I think it could carry even more richness if it was thicker. But the benefit is that this ends up being a beer that goes down easy - just like the Edmund Fitzgerald itself (too soon?)! Aaanyway, the smell is a nice blend of roasty malts and nuttiness, and the taste is just right in the pocket of what a porter should be: roast malt, touches of coffee and nuttiness, and a great balance of sweetness and bitterness. And the price is really right! If you like porters, this should be a regular staple!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,fountainofyouth,4.24,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Dark translucent brown, deep ruby red when held up to light. Large off-white head.  Smell: Browned malt, toasted bread, dark nuts, a bit of cinnamon and hop spice.  Taste: Fairly robust hop character -- not excessive, but generally more than I prefer. It is a well-balanced beer, though. Malt flavor follows the aroma, a nutty, toasty, and slightly roasty profile. Little hint of milk chocolate.  Feel: Light-bodied, with fairly light carbonation. Creamy finish.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Vetbidder,4.14,"Dark opaque appearance with a tan head. I’ve got to admit the chocolate sweet malty nose is pretty nice. Ok I expected this to be sweeter but it definitely leans on the bitter side of sweet. I also expected it to be a bit thicker but it’s thin enough to have a few. Creamy and decently carbonated, that really helps this brew.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

There's a slight roast aroma to it as well. Taste - There is some chocolate in it. It's more of a bitter dark chocolate - which I'm a huge fan of. There's a slight smoke flavor here. Slight sweetness, that I just can't fully place or describe. Feel - This is actually lighter bodied. Not watery, but lighter than I was expecting. There's a bitterness that lingers in my palate. Interesting and tasty beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Rich, sweet (but balanced), toasty, chocolatey, velvety. I haven't had a Founders Porter in a while so I can't fairly compare it to what I would consider the gold standard, but this offering from Great Lakes is not at all lacking.  It's just one of those beers that makes it hard to try something new, because you feel like picking up more of it the next time you're at the store.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,Buck1,3.91,"Since today is Nov. 10 the date 44 years ago the Edmund Fitzgerald was lost when the gales of November came early. I thought it would be proper day to review it. Looks like a typical porter , dark with thin head. Smells like cocoa with some malty nuttiness. Taste is malty with some hops ,cocoa and almost a spiciness on the dry finish. Not to sweet like some porters. Some porters try to on the heavy side more like a stout. Some may thinkit is thin compared to some American Porters but I would say it is right on the mouth feel with an English porter. Finishes bitter and dry with a bit more hops than an English porter, It is a very good refreshing porter and very drinkable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Amazingly well-balanced, no lingering aftertaste. $10.48 out the door is a steal! There are many close to this, but none better. Honestly, I find a score under 100 amusing. I can find absolutely nothing wrong with this perfect brew. Ó U T S T A N D I N G ! ! !",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Radsonnn,3.52,"A: Light toasty head, dissipates quickly. Very dark brown almost black...Say dark mahogany. Nice lacing  N: Heavy roasted malt, some caramel. A lot of earthy notes, some subdude nut, and chocolate notes. bit of alcohol scent given ABV.  T: Again, heavy up front with the roasted malt, but then things change for the taste. Less sweet and a lot more coffee notes than expected. Hint of chocolate on the finish. Very aromatic.  M: On the much lighter side of medium, much less full than I would usually prefer. Light carbonation which I thoroughly enjoy.  O: Solid porter, but not one of my favorites. I was expecting it to be much less bitter, and more full on the body. The nose is great, and its a nice pour, but the taste and feel (more so the feel) leave something to be desired. Definitely something I enjoyed and, would for certain pick up again once in a while!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,WYeates,4.41,"This porter pours to a dark black with a creamy head. The smell is a mix of chocolate and nutty notes. The taste is a smooth chocolate, nut, and light spice blend highlighted by a clean wet after taste.  This is the best porter I have had to date. How it's able to maintain the texture of a porter without an ovet powering finish is incredible.  Definitely a Smooth Approved offering.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Taste: Sweet caramel, toffee, and raisin flavors are perfectly balanced by bitter dark chocolate, coffee, and piney hops. Delicious. Feel: Thin- to medium-bodied, fizzy, and crisp.

73,226,izraelc,4.41,This may be one of the best porters I've ever had. Pours black. Malt aroma. This is a nice dry porter with a full roasted malt body. Just a little sweetness. Bitter earthy finish. Great character. Too bad the theme is so depressing.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,defunksta,4.2,"If you really want the nitty-gritty details, which is why you're here, bear with me...  Poured into a pint glass at 45 degrees,  Appearance: Pours a dark brown, maybe black color with a small tan head. Only minimal clarity. Minimal carbonation too. SRM 22-23. (3.75)  Aroma: Aroma is of rounded, bittersweet & milk chocolate, but minimal some toffee & strudel malts. A nice airy roast to balance. Might be roasted barley. Faintly sweet, but leans primarily bitter and pleasant. Well rounded (4.00)  Flavor: Flavor is bittersweet cocoa predominantly. Has a full-thickness, maybe aromatic citrus & pastry sweetness that lingers throughout. Yes the trace fruity sweetness, but there is a strong initial bittersweet cocoa flavor that predominates. Some roasted coffee flavor, that evolves into a bread, caramel, toffee and malt flavor as it finishes. This might be more from the roasted barley. There is no residual sweetness or resin left on the tongue. The nice addition of pastry/citrus sweetness is unique and memorable here. (4.25)  Feel: The body is full. Minimal carbonation. Slightly watery & resiny and hides the alcohol.. Very smooth on the tongue as a porter should be. (3.50)  Compared to Revolution's Eugene Porter, this one is more bitter and has more of a sweet caramel and breaded malt flavor rather than a more pronounced milk chocolate flavor in Eugene.  Compared to Founder's Porter 3/22/20: Pours cleaner and a lighter tan head. Leans toward simple chocolate. Both are dry, but this one is slightly lighter and airier. 2/28/21: Pours a similar, slightly lighter color with a lighter and cleaner tan head. Cleaner and more rounded aromas of chocolate and airy roast. Less rich chocolate, smoked meat, and malt. Similar, but slightly more rounded, sharp, and airy. Less thick, dark, and smokey. 3/19/21: Lighter, milder head. Slightly less chocolate. More airy, espresso roast. 1/4/22: More airy malt, and bittersweet chocolate. Less mocha, and rich chocolate.  Compared to Bell's Porter in 2020: Nearly identical. Slightly darker tan head. Maybe more roasty and bittersweet chocolate than milk notes. Less chocolate. Hard to tell, maybe it's just less creamy and more carbonated. 1/17/21: Pours a similar color. More roasty and bittersweet cocoa. Less dark malt and malt flavors. 2/25/21: Pours a similar color. More roasty aromas. More chocolate, lactose, and airy coffee roast. Less malts and nuts. More balanced and clean. Less malty. 4/14/21: More dark chocolate and espresso roast aromas. Less milk and rich chocolate, smokey and nutty malts. More lactose cream, but leans dryer and more roasty.  Compared to Summit Great Northern Porter 3/29/20: Pours a similar color with less head. More milk and pastry notes and less roasty chocolate. Similar bitterness. More complex and slightly better flavor profile  Compared to Bell's Kalamazoo Stout 1/27/21: Pours a similar color with a lighter head. Similar aromas, but slightly lighter with less cocoa. Slightly more pine and less malt. Less cocoa, black malt, and bitterness. Lighter, cleaner, and simpler. 4/21/21: Pours a similar color with a lighter head. More milk chocolate and creamy malts. Less espresso roast and black malt. Leans more malty and smooth. 1/21/22: Similar aromas. More bitter coffee roast. Less smooth bittersweet chocolate and dark malt/leather. Dryer.  Compared to Left Hand Brewing's Death Before Disco Porter 3/7/21: Similar color. Stronger, but lighter head. More cocoa powder, airy espresso roast, light lactose cream. Less dark and rich chocolate, dark malt, and dark berry malt profile. Less sweet and heavy. Cleaner, airier, and dryer.  to Bent Paddle Black 2/24/22: Pours a similar color. Larger head. Stronger aromas. More smooth rich, milk chocolate. Less coffee roast and dry chocolate. Larger bodied. 3/2/22: Milder aromas. More airy roast, less chocolate. Slightly more bitter. (Different than previous) 3/29/22: Similar aromas. Slightly more rich chocolate, less black malt. Sweeter and more bitter. 4/19/22: Slightly roastier aromas. More rich chocolate and espresso roast. Less black malt and dark fruit. More bitter.  Compared to 3 Floyds Alpha Clause 1/2023: Pours lighter, milder head and aromas. More smooth chocolate and coffee roast. Less bitter pine and hops. More balanced.  Overall: The Edmund Fitzgerald is a wonder of a porter and I can understand the high ratings. Not only does it balance bitterness, sweetness, flavor, and dryness, but it does so at the same time which is quite unique and not something I've experienced before. The bittersweet cocoa is pronounced but yet simultaneously balanced by a flavorful sweet caramel and pastry malt presence. It leaves a clean, dry finish with no residual sweetness, making you want a little more. Very impressed by this porter and want to compare to more of the style.

Beer poured brown with a nice off white head that has some good hang time.  Nose is mild roasted malts and chocolate.

73,226,Lingenbrau,4.46,"Thanks Joe!  Eddie Fitz is a beautiful beer. Deep brown disguising what is really gorgeous garnet and hazelnut colors. It's exceptionally clear and sports a proud lightly tanned foam for a cap. The creamy ring leaves spotty lace from tip to toe.  That's a fine proper smelling Porter. Chocolate and freshly roasted coffee beans. Lighter notes of brown sugar, a touch of smoke, and an earthy and woody finish exemplify what a porter should smell like.  Slightly less intense than it's aroma would imply, but still absolutely delicious. A tad smokier than expected as well, which I fully embrace with open taste buds. Roasted grains, bakers chocolate, coffee and chicory make up the backbone. .ight and clean feel to it with a robust punch. Each sip leaves a lingering sweet taste but bittered feel. This is remarkably drinkable which sucks because I'm just about done with the only bottle. I could go for three or four of these right now.  This Porter here is easily in the top 5 of near perfect to style in my humble opinion.

Added : after giving him the second try I find the coffee of undertones to be a bit heavy if not in the proper mood. This isn't a porter that you want to drink in quantity or rush...

I’ve long heard the legend of this beer but it caught me a little off guard since it was frequently mentioned with Founders as the best in class, but they are very different in flavor profile, IMO.

The roastiness (is that a word?) of this beer is incredible. Chocolate malt, coffee bean, vanilla, lactose, bitter dark fruit.  The feel is pretty damn good for a low abv porter.

T: Tasted of a bit of chocolate (definitely could have used more), a lot of roasted malt, a creamy quality, a hint of coffee (only evident in the finish), a chalky lactose quality, and some hops.

On the nose, the first impact is chocolate followed by roasty malt. As it warmed up a little, there was a hint of sweetness.  The taste is very good. Taste leads with malt, but eventually is taken over by a slightly sweet chocolate note that is strong on the chocolate. Right on the finish there is a notable floral presence and a bit of a bitter bite that I assume is amplified some by whatever hops are used. All in all, a clean tasting, well crafted porter.  The feel has a bit of carbonation ""sting"" to it, but the general feel is smooth and almost creamy. Not too thick on the body - medium at best which is fine for the style. There is a little lingering chalky feel and a residual flavor of chocolate that gets a bit sweeter as it fades.  Overall, this is a very good porter. Whether it is worthy of the hype is debatable in my mind. I can't say I have had better, but I have certainly had at least two equals.

73,226,Jadjunk,3.98,"""Robust and complex, our Porter is a bittersweet tribute to the legendary freighter's fallen crew--taken too soon when the gales of November came early."" Brewed in the style of an American Porter, available in 12 oz. bottled 6 packs and on year round draft.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a snifter glass.  (Appearance) Pours a crisp, frothy head of a medium tan consistency over an opaque dark brown body with fine sediment and sunset red highlights. Retention is good and lacing is light and patchy. 4  (Smell) Toasted caramel grain, chocolate malt and earthy toffee form a complex, yet drinkable malt body with a subtle lightness, essential for a porter. Delicate undertones of roast and dark fruit. Very textbook but pleasing aroma with no unexpected additions. Potency is moderate. 4  (Taste) The flavor largely follows the aroma, with a light-drinking malt body of dry chocolate malt, smooth toffee and lightly toasted caramel malt midsection, and a gentle cold roasted malt finish. Very clean, highly drinkable. 4  (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, lightly chewy, medium dry. Carbonation is moderate, generating a medium frothiness and a moderately crisp finish. Body is medium for the style, medium+ overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to roasted and toasted specialty malt character bitterness. Alcohol presence is light and there are no off characters. 3.75  (Overall) Edmund Fitzgerald Porter isn't extraordinary by any means in that it doesn't take any particular risks in pushing the style beyond its current boundaries, but falls rather gracefully in the middle, generating a precise, enjoyable malt body that nicely balances out with the subtle specialty malt character, all while maintaining a high lightness and drinkability, essential for the design of a quality porter. In conclusion, it doesn't reach the pinnacle of some experimental and unique variations on the style, but is a great starting place for what we should come to expect from our American Porters. 4  Great Lakes Brewing Co.'s Edmund Fitzgerald Porter 3.98/5.00",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Poured a very dark brown color, just short of black, and had a bit of a reddish tint near the edges. The beer was nicely clear, and had about 1/2 inch of tan head that dissipated at a moderate pace and left low lacing.  Some nicely gentle roast notes were at the front of the olfactory portion of the program, with a gentle underlying malt scent. No noticeable hop profile. The taste was similar, but stronger, with the roast bordering on being coffee-like.  The body was thinner than I prefer in the style, but was smooth and even. There was good carbonation across the tongue, giving a very enjoyable effervescence. The roasted flavors lingered a few moments at the back of the palate, and led to a dry finish.

The head had an initial rise and subsided quickly leaving just a thin layer on top which helped accentuate the great aroma of coffee and chocolate that this beer releases. As far as taste it matched the smell which I thought was delicious. As for feel I really am not an expert but I thought that it changed from the start toward the finish but it could have been a little too cold to start with and as it came to an appropriate temperature really became pleasant.

73,226,Nimbus_,4.48,"Look: Great looking beer. Pours nearly black, although holding up to light reveals a surprisingly clear dark brown cola color. I poured this pretty aggressively and ended up with about three fingers of tan head which went down fairly quickly leaving a thin layer to sit on top for the session. A splotchy lacing was left on the glass as I drank.  Smell: Initially, I got a lot of roasted malt, coffee, and just a tiny bit of chocolate. As I drank I noticed that the roasty aroma subsided and it balanced out very well with the chocolate.  Taste: Very similar to the taste. The first two sips or so had overpowering roasted malt and coffee flavors, which I am completely fine with. As I drank, the sweetness of the chocolate emerged a little more to balance out the flavors. There is a slight hop presence in the finish too that isn't overly bitter, and it actually balances the sweetness of the chocolate very well.  Feel: Medium bodied, and slightly creamy. An appropriate amount of gentle carbonation. A slightly dry finish that fits the roasted malt and mildly hoppy taste near the end.  Overall: I really liked this brew.

73,226,Beginner2,4.25,"Edmund Fitzgerald is an early American porter that does not rely on hops for a dry finish. Great Lakes instead makes the dryness from expert malt roasting and blending. Since this pioneering recipe, many other American crafters in the last two decades have given Edmund Fitz some competition; but Fitz remains a classic in my book.  As for my technical review of Fitz... Looks are barely above average (could have more foam.) Smell gives lots of toasty, roasted barley malt and chocolate and coffee... all of my favorite aromas. Blending comes through in this well-integrated beer. The after-taste stays bitter-sweet. Decent with a hard gouda.  And I give Great Lakes very big OA Hugs for being a second generation pioneer that really got growing in the 1990s and, now, being employee owned since 2018.

He writes there are 60 IBU, but today's bottle (2022) says only 37... which I certainly agree with because 60 is bitter and 37 is smooth.  10/14/22 Had again and went on their website just to confirm my thoughts and memory.

73,226,88caprice,3.47,"Poured from a bottle into a nonic pint.  Look is deep dark brown. Nice creamy layer on top and respectable lacing. Smell is 58% dark malts, 34% coffee, 6% sweet cigar, and a fleeting 2% dried cherries or generic acidic fruitiness.  Beautiful malts in the nose set expectations. Taste has initial (albeit lesser) roasted malt and burnt sugar. By mid swallow malts are gone and you're left with char. The aftertaste goes to the hop end of the seesaw with an herbal, grassy bitterness.

73,226,Lagerlivesmatter,4.23,"Porters are sort of hard to pinpoint. Kind of a blurry line between them and stouts. Be that as it may, as a beer this is certainly great whatever you want to call it.  Pours a very dark brown with an amberish hue. Smells like what you would expect, coffee, roasted malts, subtle fruits. Taste follows, strong malty coffee/espresso, hints of fruits (i find this to be highly subjective as what you will pick out, to me raisins/prunes and cherry) and a balancing earthy bitterness.  Maybe a bit thin on the mouth? But like I said porters are a strange beast so I wont knock it too much for that. Otherwise, probably the best Porter i've had.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Chilled to 39 degrees, allowed to sit for 10 minutes unopened, poured into oversize wine glass.  Look: Poured a dark ebony brown/black color with a 1/2"" dark khaki color head that dissipated fairly quickly leaving a thin ring of foam. Swirling the glass produced a modest bit of lacing.  Smell: Coffee and chocolate, caramel malt, maybe a hint of nuttiness.  Taste: Bold coffee and roasted/burnt malt, chocolate, cola, a hint almost of wine or champagne flavors. A slight but not unpleasant grassy aftertaste. Hop flavors balance nicely, with a smokey touch.  Mouthfeel: Creaminess despite the lack of a bigger head at the pour, carbonation is light but noticeable early on dropping off later as it warmed. I felt a little tingle on the lips, again not unpleasant.  Overall: I've only tried a few porters since getting deeper into craft beers so I'm no expert but I feel this beer certainly represents the style very well and I look forward to trying this one again (and again!).

Look: Pours a deep caramel color, and settles a very rich dark brown, retaining caramel highlights. A fair sized finger white head remained shortly, before disappearing completely.  Smell: Rich coffee notes, and some dark cocoa, accompanied by a nice smoky/charred aspect. Some faint caramel, dark malts, brown sugar, and dark fruits are present, although not as profound.  Feel: Medium bodied, and heavily carbonated.  Taste: Rich bitter coffee, engulfed by charred smokiness, followed by some dark cocoa. About midway through, the coffee mellows out, and some of the caramel, malts, and dark fruits appear, but are soon drowned by the coffee returning into the back end.  Overall: I had heard a lot of good things about this, so I finally decided to pick up a bottle, albeit it was about a week past its BB date.

The taste is not as sweet as the nose: coffee, bitter chocolate, char, and nutty pine, with sour, bitter finish. As the glass warmed, I also detected a very slight sweet after taste.

I haven't had too many American Porters before - most of the ones I've had have been Baltic. This is like a baltic, but with the flavor turned up to 11.  A: Beautiful brown head and deep chocolate color  S: Smell is relatively tame. Mostly just roasted malts and some caramel  T: Very balanced, a hair on the sweet side. Heavy caramel roasted malt taste with a medium amount of hop bitterness and a surprisingly high amount of hop taste as well. Really delicious flavor that is way beyond what the 6% ABV label would suggest. The amount of flavor is on part with imperial stouts I have had from other companies, and the quality is there to boot.  M: Medium amount of carbonation. A bit heavy to be sessionable perhaps.

73,226,hopphead31415,4.29,"I really like the Great Lakes Brewing Company, because they are world class. The Bros really speak highly of this variety and so I had to try it. This one is an even 6.0% ABV and has a lot to offer. Let me tell you about this brew.  Look-It pours a dark black that is deeper than the depths of the Great Lakes where the fated Fitzgerald lies for eternity. The head pours thick and rich silky foam that is off-white like the foam on the lake shores after a torrential storm where waves twenty feet high pound the coastline. The lacing is perforated and foamy like the rock-smashed hull of the ship.  Smell-It smells of roasted caramel malts and chocolate infused coffee. Grains and hints of Beachwood swim and waft among aromas of caramel and smoky barrels like the aftermath of the cataclysmic wreck of the Fitzgerald.  Taste-The taste reliably follows the nose much like the Fitzgerald followed the storm swells into its chaotic demise. The caramel, coffee, and chocolate fill ones senses much like the icy cold waters of the Great Lakes inexorably filled the hull of the fated ship. A mild sweetness is tempered by grassy seaweed hops, from the depths of the Great Lakes, that exhibit an herbal quality.  Mouthfeel-It feels like silky smooth wetness from the perilous dark waters of the Great Lakes. The medium-bodied creaminess reflects off the foam churned waters of the Lakes. It leaves a coating of chocolate esters and smoky grains on the tongue much like the deep floors of the depths of the Great Lakes are coated in the corpses of untold thousands of fated ships that dared cross these perilous Lakes.  Overall-This beer is world class for a reason and I think that you should pull up the anchor and sail out to grab a six pack or two of these dark delicious beauties. But beware, if you drink too many, you may find yourself at the cold dark depths of a lake of shameful hangover. Be sure to wash down this beauty with some fresh water, because you won’t be able to stop popping the top of the depth of this darkness.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,sjdevel,4.74,"Look: Pours a very dark brownish-red (that's nearly black). The 12 oz. bottle was a bit lower in carbonation than expected with only a 1 finger head. Foam that is present is a nice tan/khaki color. Lacing is nice after the head recedes.  Smell: Smells of chocolate and smoked malt with a fruity tartness.  Taste: First there's an attack of hops that bites firmly and quickly offset with chocolate, coffee, toffee, and caramel flavors. The rich sweetness of these flavors nicely balance out the hop bitterness. There are nice smokey and woodsy flavors throughout. Next, the sweetness is cut by a slight fruitiness and a dry finish. Then you are left with a smoked malt / charred wood aftertaste.  Feel: Very nice medium mouthfeel. Not too heavy or syrupy and offers some bubbles on the tongue.  Overall: This is a great porter and was my ""GATEWAY"" beer. I had this beer over a decade ago (back when I didn't like beer because I didn't know what real beer was) and it changed me. Back then this was the most amazing beer I had ever had, but now it is just really good as I have had so many outstanding beers since. ""Just really good"" is still really good.

Feels like it is on nitro or could be a milk stout. Overall a smooth drinking Porter which I would defiantly drink again. If the flavor was a little deeper this would be a world class beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Dustin_Sallitt,4.25,"This is a pretty damn good porter. The nose is smoky decadent chocolate with dark fruits.

73,226,slusk,4.34,"L: Pours a clear, dark garnet with a thin tan head.  S: A bit of woody hop, Dark fruit and raisin. Some coffee and bread crust  T: Big flavor. Woody, almost hickory smoke flavor with some burnt sugar and coffee. Dark fruits in the background, mostly prune or raisin. The bitterness is well balanced by the sweet malt. Many layers of flavor here. Nice bread crust in a semi dry finish.  F: A bit chewier than the typical porter I think. Medium body and Low carbonation.  O: The flavor surprised me. The smell doesn't compare to the explosion of big flavor in this beer. Everything balances well and it has a brilliant complexity. There's a bit of warming in the finish.

73,226,hoptheology,4.27,"2019 12 oz bottle into Christmas Chalice  Cola pour forming into a dark coffee black body, head of 1/2 finger, gorgeous lacing.  Aroma of acrid burnt malts, some espresso, some dark chocolate.  Flavor is roasty heaven. Tons of coffee, slick black patent malt, acrid ashiness, and finishes with hints of licorice, molasses, and dark chocolate.  Feel is creamy and borders on stout but definitely still a porter. Roasty. Medium alcohol warmth.  Overall probably the best standard porter ever made.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Original review 2015 (overall 3.93) : Thanks Ozzylizzard for a great trade!  A : The body is chocolate brown and 100% opaque. The head pours 1 finger, retaining a beige/pink color and leaving small hills of lace like coffee froth on the sides of the pint glass. Soon the head is reduced to a creamy lid simply capping off the dense body.  S : Chocolate and black licorice both tag team and fight for dominance, behind that a sweet aromatic vanilla cream and some slight blended coffee and malts. A solid aroma that remains simple and sweet...but for me it's just not loud enough and lacks depth.  T : It's strong off the bat with alcohol and lots of charred barley, but I'm lacking some serious wow factor here. The off-note seems to be from fresh peeled and eaten snap peas, it's just very vegetal. Beyond that I'm tasting vanilla bean, dark coffee, cacao nibs, and graham cracker. There's a hint of bubble gum behind it as well, and while I like those yeasty flavors, in a Porter style it doesn't belong.  For some reason I just think of a piano when I'm tasting this. It's a mental picture. I'm not sure why. It's classy, glassy, elegant, with ivory and ebony notes (vanilla and chocolate respectively). It sits heavy in the belly and fills me up more than I'd like to be.  F : It's sticky, thick, rich, and sappy. I like it, it's the proper thickness, and ends with roasted coffee dryness and slight wet parchment paper.  O : It's a solid beer but in my opinion, far from the ""world class"" rating it gets. I've had much better porters and I don't think I'll be going back to this one again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jaxray8,4.75,Not porter guy per SE. I think most breweries make them too sweet or too dark so when I have a good one I appreciate it... And this is one is awesome. It's better on tap then in a bottle but still fantastic.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,dd43,4.28,"What a fantastic porter, I'd put this up there with Founders Porter as one of my favorites in the style category with a slight edge going towards founders.  Tan foamy head of a finger or two depending on the pour, laces well. Aromas of toasty bread, a light coffee note, and dark chocolate. Flavors are more toasted wheat bread crust and roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, which I feel is something that separates porters from stouts (especially imperial) even though there really isn't a textbook definition of what delineates these beer styles.

Time to rate it, but critically, because I've been thinking for a while that our local favorites at great lakes need to look at doing a v2 of some of these venerable brews.  Its dark and has a great head and nice small bubbles. The aroma is clean, roastyand malty.  The taste is a great balance of roast, sweet malts, and a bit of hops. Very drinkable and refreshing for an American Porter. The aftertaste lingers perfectly. It is a great Porter but ....  I would like to see the raising of the Edmund Fitzgerald. A slightly bigger version. I loved Alberta Clipper, with its fruity overtones.

Smell: cocoa, vanilla, smoky coffee notes, a sweetness that I can't quite place... exquisitely smelling beer.  Taste: I'm not sure I can adequately convey how awesome this tastes. There is a smoky coffee flavor pervading throughout. Choco-vanilla and some dark fruit notes (dates?) are also present. The coffee flavor gives it a bitterness that rounds out the swallow and leaves you with a pleasant smoky aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: low fizziness and a creamy, somewhat heavy feel, almost stout-like.

S: Cocoa & vanilla jump out of the glass. Almost some pitted fruit/dark berry undertones. Brown sugar. Smells great.  T: Following the nose this is a bit of a disappointment. Milk chocolate & raspberry are the two components that seem to dominate the palate. A skootch of hop-bitterness toward the finish. Not as complex as I'd hoped.  M: Lowish carb & perfectly, silkily creamy feel. Just heavy enough on the palate to remind you that you're drinking a porter.  O: There are high notes & there are average notes.

Rocky, with very nice lacing. (Outstanding retention on that head).  Aroma: Very earthy/roasty; ""dirty"" smell (in a good way). A little duller than usual. (Sweet roasted malt dominates with a fresh mineral roast character behind and hints of caramel sweetness).  Taste: Slightly tart, dry arrival. Clean, slightly sweet, earthy, roasty mid-palate. Damp leaves. Bitter, roasty finish. (Not really that roasty on the finish compared to Founders Porter or Bell’s Kalamazoo Stout).  Mouthfeel: Good weight without being heavy. Solid carbonation. Not slick. (This is what really sets this Porter apart for me; it is thick but remains drinkable and clean on the palate).  Overall: A real winner.

Near black appearance but when held to light shows beautiful clarity - dark brown with a dark red tint. Looks awesome. S - Coffee, unsweetened cocoa. A hint of spice. Robust. Rich aroma. T - Rich malt, roasty character that stays with you after each sip. Bittersweet chocolate/cocoa is the primary flavor. Perhaps the slightest hint of spicy hop character comes through as well, along with an equally slight hint of alcohol. Amazing perfect combination of flavors. F - For me perhaps the only place I'd want a little more - wish this was just the slightest bit ""chewier."" Not thin and watery by any means but I'd like just a little more body. Carbonation spot on. O - I'm still relatively new to rating beers (although several of those I've rated are beers I've had a number of times). Still when actually breaking it down and analyzing what I'm tasting, it seems I can still be surprised by familiar beers. This is one of those - I've always liked this beer but never quite realized how good it really is. I will probably never give a 5 in any category just to leave room for something unexpected so for me this beer makes a very close run at ""perfection.""

Nose: It has a decent bit of smells going on here. Mainly coffee, chocolate, malty smells here. Taste: Sweetness, dark malt, chocolate, coffee, also got a slight nutty taste. It is pretty standard dark beer. I think it is a good porter, but nothing jumps out at me that makes this stand out among other porters/stouts. The sweetness is nice because I like a good sweet porter. Moulth: Not much carbonation, pretty light(maybe not compared to an ale), drinkable I would say a light body for a porter/stout.

With the Deschutes, this was the hoppiest, but EF has a more fruity and herbal twist which integrates into the roasted dark malts better, and has a more substantial mouthful.

It's like being in an old wooden shed (or perhaps a wheelhouse!) sets the mood for me.  Taste: roasted malt, some metallic taste is in there but not bothersome to me. Husky grain/woody character (makes the beer for me). Some lingering bitterness but not much. Just enough to make me go back for the next sip.  Mouthfeel: light to medium mouthfeel. It does border watery but, running it between my teeth makes it creamy. Would like a bit more body.  Overall: Currently my favorite porter but I can't get it where I am in Texas (yet!). I got this sample on a trip to Virginia. I can drink several of these. This is a fine porter. It says, i'm a porter so don't look for a stout.

Light chocolate brown head, but it dissipates down quickly.  Smell - 4.25/5 Chocolate/cocoa, roastiness, nuttiness, hops. Smells delicious.  Taste - 4.5/5 Tastes basically like the smell. Roasty, chocolate, smoky, with a nice hints of hops which is not too much or too little, but just the right amount of hops for a porter.  Mouthfeel - 3.75/5 Medium-bodied. The beer is a little bit watery feeling, I would have liked for it to be a bit 'thicker'. The beer is very smooth, and there is a nicely balanced medium amount of carbonation.  Overall - 4.5/5 I remember this being one of my favorite porters/stouts, but today when I reviewed, I was a bit underwhelmed. It didn't taste exactly like I remembered. Mainly I don't remember it feeling so watery. But it was still great. I would highly recommend this to everyone.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Mises85,4.79,"I have never grown up to porters because they never seemed to strike the right balance between coffee, chocolate, and the roasty characteristics one might find in a really good stout. This one just hit it way out of the ball park!  Appearance: jet black with a 1.5 inch head.  Smell: Roasty but then getting into a milk stoutish character. Some milk chocolate notes and some faint black coffee notes. Not fruity.  Taste: Unreal. slightly chocolatey, a little black malt, mocha, and some faint mint.  Feel: super smooth.

73,226,cjgiant,4.29,"Bottle dated 10/20/14; revisit 8/2015: Pours a dark brown; looks black, but held up to the light yields it's a tad lighter, and probably fairly clear. Head is light tan, collects at the edges, and returns nice and foamy with some agitation. Lacing in my pour is minimal. Revisit: still dark, but more obviously ""not black"". Head is nice with some lacing.  Nose has some toasted notes, and I get some coffee and chocolate, but I actually get a nice does of roasted nut. As the beer warms, I get a little more of the former, but the first sniffs reminded me of a nut spread (not having had a lot of Nutella, I fell back to peanut butter, but I could see it being a deeper or darker ""nut butter"").  The taste actually seems to border on the stout side. I get oily and bitter flavors up front, coffee and nut, both perhaps sitting on the fire a tad long. I am presuming its the hops that actually bring in a very light citrus taste as the beer goes to middle and end, almost reversing the normal balancing act (the front is bitter and is reined in by the fruity hops). Revisit: not completely sure where my stout comment came from, other than the malty notes being more prevalent in my original review. There is a definite amount of bitterness in this brew, but it seems that roasted astringency could be a factor as well. Not sure I would describe the hops influence as citrus any longer, either: a woody to maybe lightly herbal-to flowery at best, but there definitely seems to be something influencing the flavor other than just the malt flavor.  I can see why the rating is what it is. There is a lot of interesting things going on here, and overall it's yet another solid beer from Great Lakes. There's just something about it in the end that made me downgrade it against the BA calculated score, and it has to do with the back end of the taste in offering I had. I definitely need to have this again to verify my thoughts on this review.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The head leaves spotty lacing and possesses impressive retention time.  Smell -wonderful aromatic blend of coffee, dark chocolate and a hint of licorice. Even a bit of an oatmeal like aroma too. Great smelling porter.  Taste - coffee and chocolate dominate, but there's a touch of leather before resorting to a chocolate covered coffee bean flavor. Hints of vanilla throughout and a dabbling of caramel make this a complex porter. Truly excellent.  Mouthfeel - smooth, creamy, velvety like texture. Carbonation is present and not insubstantial, but is also hard to notice. Oily and slick finish. Eminently drinkable.  Overall - a truly fantastic porter, probably the best I've ever had, and I'm impressed with the accessibility.

The aroma is that of bittersweet chocolate and dates, and a touch of something like black cherry. The flavor is phenomenal, especially for a low ABV porter! An initial burst of dark cocoa and dash of chocolate gives way to a grainy base. There is a mouth feel that is soft, much like chocolate mousse. The entire effect actually is a creamy, dairly like one. The mouth feel is rather light, it's not very strong or syrupy at all, but as I mentioned it has a great taste, leaving nothing to be desired.

73,226,UrbanCaveman,4.64,"12 oz bottle, poured into a pint glass at 50 degrees F.  A: Pours a deep, dark brown, but clear enough to see through. What little head forms is thin and quickly dissipates, though the beer leaves nice lacing on the glass for a moment ere it slides back into the liquid.  S: Slightly smoky dark roasted coffee and 90%+ dark chocolate riding a charred grain malt aroma, with some hints of sweetness around the edges.  T: Oh, that's malty. Dark, charred roasted grain, deliciously bitter, with the black roasted coffee and extra-dark chocolate notes clearly present. There are some hints of campfire smoke and cherry wood, or at least the flavor I get off of meat smoked over cherry wood. The finish is a deeply satisfying bitter roasted grain.  M: While rich, the mouthfeel is surprisingly light, given the nose and flavor profile. It manages to feel light and drinkable, without being too watery.  O: This is just a good, solid porter.

73,226,woemad,4.25,"12oz bottle received via a trade with the outstanding ShroudOfDoom. Consumed while listening to the pre-game show for the UW-Illinois game. In that vein: Pre-Game Show This is a beer I’ve wanted for a long time, for its reputed excellence, for its rarity (at least where I live) and because I’m a history nerd and the Edmund Fitzgerald is a fascinating story. Interestingly, there’s boilerplate re: the Bavarian Purity Law, despite the fact that 1) it’s not Bavarian, but Clevelandian, 2) it’s a porter and 3) even in Bavaria, the Bavarian Purity Law is no longer a law, but an advertising gimmick. According to the label, this is best by September 14th, 2014 (i.e., tommorow!). I’m not sure I’ve ever had a beer so close to the day it expires. Sadly, I’ve had a number recently that were past such a date (Thanks again, Total Wine!). I don’t think a porter would be affected the same way an IPA would be, so I’m not too worried. The Look Poured into a Boundary Bay pint glass (The one received from BeerTunes - thanks, Terry!), this was a dark brown that took on a rubyish tint when held up to light. There was a thick, bubbly tan head that left sheets of foam on the sides of the glass when it receded. Most of the foam disappeared, leaving “beer neglige” type lace. The Nose Initially, I got a mild chocolate-type aroma. As it warmed, there was a coffeeish bitterness, but the sweetness seemed to stay in charge. The Taste Much more bitter in the taste than in the nose. Roasty malts upfront with notes of coffee and chocolate, in that order. The finish is dry, and there is a kind of lactic sourness thing happening, but not to a jarring degree. The lingering aftertaste is more chocolatey than anything else. The Mouthfeel Medium bodied, with a creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot-on. Post-Game Show An outstanding porter. Is it the best I’ve ever had? I’m not sure. I’d have to go back through lots of reviews at this point, and I lack the motivation to do that right now! Right now, I can’t think of many others to put in its company.

73,226,puboflyons,4.75,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle conveyed to me from a non BA-member. Sampled on August 15, 2014.  A deep dark brown-reddish pour greets my eyes with a lingering tan head up top.  That aroma is what a Porter should be all about with its milk chocolate and smoky malt quality and more subtle and mellow earthy hop note.  Medium body, which is better than many in its class.  Like the aroma the milk chocolate takes center stage in the flavor and a nice smoky goodness to enhance it further. Mildly dry finish. A highly recommended Porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Aroma is of fresh chocolate brownies mixed with roasted malts and burnt coffee. Sweet cocoa and oak are also in the mix, no hops present and alcohol is very light.  Tastes of charred oak followed by sweet coffee and burnt malts. No hops are detected and alcohol is slightly in aftertaste.  Beer is light bodied for a porter but has a nice creaminess like its on nitro. Carbonation is above average and finishes a bit dry.  Overall, beer is exceptional for the style.

Pours black with a khaki head. Aroma is roasty with dark chocolate, fruits, and some coffee. Also there is a good dose of sweet sugars. Flavor followed suit and was completely derailed by the presence of a high concentration of sugars. Seemed to me like the recipe is a good one but there was an issue with the brewing process. A heavy mouthfeel. Overall, thought this had glimpses of being the great porter everyone makes it out to be but derailed by some intense sugars.

This brew has an Abv of 5.80 then and now it is 6.00% The Edmund Fitzgerald pours out a nice dark brown color with a thick light brown head. This brew has the look of coffee , not saying that is a bad thing. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with sweetness, roasted grains and malts. You also pick up on a slight bitterness in this brew as well. Between the look and smell this is one inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is rich with sweet roasted grains and malts. You also pick up on some nice mild coffee notes and chocolate. There is a real nice balance to this brew. There is nothing over powering about this porter. It is really hard to pick up on the 6.00% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. The body of this porter is a solid medium. The mouthfeel is Bold, Rich, Roasted, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I'm giving Edmund Fitzgerald Porter a 4.50 out of 5. I would get this brew again, giving the opportunity to.

I was lucky enough to spot a single at my local supermarket after scoring some SN Summerfest (I got a tip from another BA here that I might enjoy that pils, but I digress...)  This stuff pours out like a creamy cola, just less carbonated. Smells roasty without a hint of ""burnt."" Taste follows the nose, and my eyes actually rolled up in my head a little when I got my first sip of this. Very creamy without being thick. Smooth finish, making me want another sip right away.

73,226,Roguer,3.46,"Pours a beautiful, firm light tan head with solid retention and thick, wide fields of lacing. Brew is almost perfectly black, with a slight purple hue in the body and dark brown at the bottom of the glass. Head retention is excellent.  Huge roasty notes in the aroma, balanced against caramel, cocoa, and pale malt aromas, and a semi-sweet, slightly grape-like fruit note.  Flavor comes in the reverse order of the aroma: sweet, malty, and smooth up front, with notes of cream and cocoa, with the big roasted malts coming in the latter half. A little bit stale on the front end, though; I'm not particularly feeling this. Perhaps it's normally a hoppy porter, and the hops have significantly degraded.  Sticky feel, medium-full, with a long finish.  I really wonder about the age of this bottle, and the intended flavor. There's a significant stale taste, that only builds as the bottle warms, and that's really ruining it for me. I'd like to try it again, possibly on tap, and see if maybe it's supposed to be a hoppy porter, drank fresh.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,SebD,4.09,"Appearance: It has a nice dark brown color to it with some amber hues shining through. It has a nice tan head that dies down moderately fast and leaves some lacing.

Taste: Like the aromas, it has a bunch of roasted malts, chocolate, some coffee bitterness and a touch of caramel.  Mouthfeel: It has a medium carbonation with a nice overall balance and feel.  Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by good flavors and aromas.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,dmgeng,4.24,"I got this beer to try to compare and contrast with the Black Butte Porter in order to figure out which to make a homebrew porter clone.  A - Black color maybe just a very dark brown. Mostly clear but difficult to see from the dark color. Vibrant egg-shell colored head with light lacing.  S - Strong roasty aroma with some caramel/chocolate/malty tones. The chocolate and roasted smells seem to stick out above the rest and swirl together to make a very enticing aroma more chocolate than a stout but definitely not as much as with Black Butte.  T - Very similar to the smell this beer and has complexity but is coasting on the chocolate/roasted notes that are very characteristic of a porter. This would make a great first dark beer since it doesn't overpower with bitterness or but keeps the roasty character mixed with the sweetness of the malt. It is a powerful flavor that is very delicious. . M - Moderate to high mouth-feel. Light carbonation perfect for the style. Not too heavy in body.  Overall, this is a staple of what a porter should be. I understand why this is such an award winner and if one were to copy it it would be a great stylistic approach. Personally I would pick the Black Butte over this but I wouldn't pass it over for any regular stout or lighter beer. This beer would make a great dark beer to be drunk several at a time due to it's full flavor and richness that is outstanding. I would definitely get this again and would recommend it to any dark beer fan.  Glass- Shaker Pint",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

It didn't quite live up to what I expected, but I'm going to try to drink it out of this bottle I have and compare it to see if it's any different.  Poured into a Libbey Porter/Stout glass.  a - dark chocolate brown body with latté/coffee ice cream head. Head retention is fantastic, there is a dome of whipped cream consistency that is deflating ever so slowly.  s - sweet lemon, iced coffee. Nothing strong coming out, but I like what is coming through.  t - coffee turns to caramel, then nutty. The finish is very complex, it seems to dance on every part of my tongue with chocolate in the center, coffee on the sides, and a quick, sweetened almond bite on the tip. It tastes like I just ate a chocolate bar.  m - full and rich, just the rite amount of bitterness.  o - man am I glad I gave this another shot today.

73,226,warlord_jared,4.53,"I picked this up today after reading a bunch of reviews on here, extolling the virtues of good old Eddy Fitzgerald. I poured this cold into a 15 oz mug.  A - An absolutely beautiful DARK red-brown, a burnt mahogany if you will. Had a nice and frothy tan hea that didn't stick around too long.  S - A nice smell of mostly chocolate with a hint of roast something - reminded me a bit of dark roast coffee grounds, with malt.  T - OMG. The first taste of this is unreal. Starts incredibly mild with chocolate notes flooding in soon after. Gets a bitterness to it more like black coffee than beer, and ends with the taste of roast malt. No bad tastes at all, only dreaminess - dreaminess that is so rich that it's *almost* hard to finish the porter. Almost.  M - the best part of the whole shebang, it's consistently smooth and thick feeling, like really creamy hot chocolate. Like you're drinking a cloud.  O - not sure what else I can say that hasn't already been said. It's a stellar brew from a stellar company. Makes b me feel warm inside in the way beer does, but also how hot chocolate does on a cold winter night. Which is one time of the year I'll be positive to have this on hand at all times.

Fair retention, resulting in a broken layer of suds on the surface. Lacing is spotty at best, with little stick.  Smell - Aroma comes through with notes of milk chocolate, mocha, nutty character, and touches of earth.  Taste - Follows the nose to an extent. Chocolate with fair roasted malt qualities. Touches of smoke. Nice balance. Hints of earth creep in near the finish, along with a bit more smoke and a light, lingering mocha quality.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with light, prickly carbonation. Goes down with nice smoothness and, oddly enough, it's somewhat refreshing.  Overall - The Legendary Edmund! Not the best porter I've had, but it's up there, and I can see why it's been one of the standard bearers for the style for as long as it has.

Like an Everett porter but a bit rougher. Toasted bread finish.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium feel with a dry and chewy mouthfeel. One sip begs another.

Taste: Similar to the smell but with even more depth. Dark chocolate, roasted barley, rich caramel, some toasted grains. A touch of bittering hops on the finish. Extremely balanced. This is what a porter should taste like.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly smooth. Medium body, medium-to-low carbonation level. Spot on.  Overall: This is the quintessential porter.

A - Two fingers of sticky tan head that hung around for a couple minutes, before settling into about a half-finger's worth with some lacing of the glass. Very dark brown, although the tiniest bit of light shines through when held up to a lamp, revealing clarity and a slight ruby tinge. No evident carbonation (besides the head).  S - roasty malt notes on the nose, but not very forward. I'm finding a weak nose to be a trend with the Great Lakes stuff.  T - Nice roasty malt character, with some hints of chocolate, black cherry, cola, and maybe a touch of coffee. Sweetness of a cola balanced with bitterness of dark chocolate or coffee. No hop presence.  M - a bit flabby. Medium to full bodied like whole milk, but I'm getting an aqueous impression (as though water was added). Little to no noticeable carbonation.

Middle introduces some acidity, a bit of bitterness, which sticks around for the close.  M - Light on the tongue, but silky, with a bit of bite in the close.

This ale pours a very dark rich mahogany with a thin off white head that leaves a gorgeous silky lacing. The aroma is that of lightly brewed coffee, European dark chocolate, and toasted malts. The nose is lighter than expected but quite delicious none the less. The flavor follows the nose perfectly but with a greater intensity. It begins with coffee then gives way to sweeter chocolate and malty notes and finishes with a just slightly bitter coffee bite. My only complaint is that the body is so light.

Light tan head, this beer creates a beautiful sticky spotty sheating down the glass. Not really dark enough for my eye but the lacing makes up for this. The aroma brings scents of chocolate, bitter bakers cacao, roasty notes, and clean yeast. Does not really jump out of the glass. The flavor is fairly basic, but that is a strong point. Cocao, chalky notes, clean un-bitter roast, and coffee. Nice porter. The mouthfeel is basic, medium to full bodied, moderat carbonation.

M: Lighter than it looks, still with medium body – not as crewy as the appearance lets on. Little bit of a coating on the mouth afterwards, sweet and smoky, stout-y.  O: Ehhh, pretty good. Not my favorite porter, but a combination of some pleasing properties. Nice ability to drink, doesn’t strike me as too heavy or filling. Reminds me of a double, without the fruity funk.

S - Large cubes of dark bitter-sweet chocolate are sprinkled with a dusting of dry cocoa, trailed by light smokiness and a suggestion of mildly roasted, freshly ground coffee beans, all attributed to heavily roasted malts. English hops give the beer a dried cedar humidor, dried cigar-like earthiness that briefly crosses the olfactory on the back end.  T - Chunks of cooled bittersweet chocolate retain the aroma's dusty cocoa powder dryness with a soft waft of smokiness crossing the palate before a trickle of light iced coffee flavor interrupts hop earthiness briefly touched on in the finish.  M - Instantly noticeable as a bit over-carbonated to me, the beer almost fizzes across the tongue like soda. Edmund Fitzgerald remains a robust beer, however; falling around medium in body with a very dry, bittersweet finish.  O - Robust in appearance, aroma, and flavor but looks can be deceiving as Great Lakes' Edmund Fitzgerald remains incredibly drinkable, loaded with a delicious chocolatey malt profile that's complex and smooth with notes of smoke, aged cigar, and coffee resulting in a terrific porter. This is, without a doubt, one of my go-to dark brews!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,mick303,4.31,"12 oz bottle into a tulip, produced a slight creamy tan head over a black dark brown body. Nice film and lacing. S – roast malts, cocoa, coffee, dark cherry, smooth and complex, malty with some hints of smoky earthy bitterness. Smoke and woodchips, robust, with a graham cracker note. T – follows closely from the smell, with maybe a bit more chocolateyness, dark malts, very roasty, chocolate malts, bittersweet to be sure, dark chocolate, getting lots of dark malts with a smoky character. Start is so inviting, then goes into a spectrum of complex flavours, some interesting hop character starts to emerge behind the strong malt profile. Some interesting fruit characters tie it together. M – smooth, bittersweet cocoa, with a smooth light carbonation, light and maybe could be a bit more, then starts to dry out on the finish really well, on a pleasant malt note. Body is moderate, refreshingly drinkable for the quite generous dark malt and smokiness notes. An interesting porter and a rollercoaster experience, goey chocolate, bittersweet cocoa, tons of dark roasty malt, intense aromas and taste, all work very nicely together, the nice hopping and assertive flavours mark it out as a standout for the style. I originally thought it needed more carb, but now I'm uncertain, the complete package of this beer is quite excellent. Really drinkable and inspiring, some sweetness to it, tied with a nice bittersweet complexity. Very glad I got to try this, lived up to expectations, but I don't believe this is perfection for the style, close maybe.  Have I mentioned that Gord Lightfoot is a legend...?",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,Bone53,4.71,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass at around 45°F  Appearance: Dark brown with a red tent when put up to the light. Two finger tan head with mild lacing.  Smell: Roasted malts with coffee and chocolate aromas. A hint of earthy hops and smoke for good measure.  Taste: Follows the smell with roasted malts, bakers chocolate, and some smoke. I also get a slight caramel flavor at the back end. I don't know if its just me, but I definitely pick up some sort of nut in there as well. The earthy bitterness keeps all the flavors in check. Complex  Mouthfeel: A bit thinner than I prefer, but the smoothness makes up for it with the perfect amount of bitterness.  Overall: This beer packs a ton of flavor for 5.8% abv. Not quite as robust as the Founder's or Smuttynose Porter's, but the flavors and aromas blend extremely well. This is one of those any time beers, roasty enough for the winter months yet light enough to kick back during a BBQ or something in the summer. Its also extremely sessionable and very tasty at the same time. Every one has a favorite beer, and this just may be mine. If you're a fan of beer, regardless of style, I highly recommend this.

A - Pours a nice deep dark brown with a thin one finger light mocha head that fades to leave a thin blanket and a fluffier halo.  S - Aromas of roasty toasty malts, dark black coffee, dark chocolate. Faint faint smoke. Super faint metallic aroma though.  T - Taste is similar to the nose. Big roasted malts followed by strong coffee notes. Transitions in to nice lightly sweet dark chocolate and then some hoppy bitterness. The hops though are knocked back down by a nice lingering black coffee finish. Quite tasty.

73,226,TheFizzinator,4.35,"This is an impeccably well balanced porter. The bitterness is initially what hits your palate but it's mild and balanced by the sweetness of the malt. Following the bitterness is roasted malt, coffee beans and the faintness of almost burnt chocolate. There is a sweet smokiness in the nose that makes it smell ever so pleasant. A medium carbonated liquid that goes down easy and asks to be sipped again.

T- Additional notes of coffee (primary) and chocolate (secondary). Rich, smooth, and nutty. Roasted level never becomes harsh. Some caramel and maybe hints of toffee.

73,226,JeffoC6,4.76,"Bottled: Unknown, but enjoy by 5/20/14 Drinking: 1/11/14 @ 6:00 PM Setting: Living room couch, watching New Orleans @ Seattle. Seattle up 16-0 at the half.  A: Poured pretty aggressively and got a beautiful 2 finger, tan, vanilla/chocolate milk head. The head sticks around on this one for sure! As it drops (albeit, slowly) the beer leaves really nice lacing on the side of the glass. The beer is very dark in the glass...Not quite black, but almost a really deep ruby red. Great looking beer. After a few minutes, the head falls to a nice, rich, half-finger cap. Great lacing throughout as the beer sinks to the bottom of the glass, just like the Edmund Fitzgerallld (Gordon Lightfoot)!  S: I immediately get a note of creamy chocolate milk mixed with some roasted coffee and vanilla bean. Some undertones of char and dark cherries. This beer has a great nose and smells absolutely delicious.  T: Dark roasted coffee with all sorts of vanilla and chocolate throughout. Sweetness, then bitterness, followed by a small hint of metallic/tannins. Baltic Porter I'm assuming. Fantastic flavor throughout the drink. Absolutely delicious.  MF: This beer has a fantastic creamy mouthfeel from beginning to end. It's thick without being chewy, cloying, or overly rich. The beer coats throughout and sticks around for just the right amount of time. I love how the flavors develop as you enjoy each sip. The bit of tannin/metalic taste finishes each sip on a dry note, readying the palate for the next taste.  O: This is one of the best porters I've ever had. Not really a go-to style for me, as I'll usually choose a stout over a porter, even though there's not much difference, but I'd drink this at any time. A fail-safe option at any time, and readily available. If you're a porter fan and haven't had this bad boy, what are you waiting for?",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Maxwell,3.99,"The beer pours a dark, coffee brown with a small head of medium sized, tan bubbles and a middling retention. In body, the beer appears clear but nearly opaque from its darkness, slight hints of ruby and garnet can be seen when held to the light, but no particles seem to be present. On the nose, the beer smells of toasted oatmeal bread, rich caramel sauce, soft burnt popcorn, and fresh coffee beans moving into instant coffee mix. Light dark chocolate can be sensed from time to time in the nose, but the overall impression is of instant coffee, toast, and caramel sauce. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly sweet with a nice roasted bitter finish. Just a touch of acidity and a little hop bitters can be sensed in the beer towards the finish. In flavor, the beer begins as burning caramel sauce, working into light roast coffee, caramel malt, and a touch of herbal bitter hops. Light burnt popcorn flavors can also be sensed. The finish is of a middling length and is herbal bitters mingling with burnt black malt, touches of coffee, and just a hint of dark chocolate. The aftertaste is nearly non-existent. In the mouth, the beer feel on the light side of full-bodied, with a very smooth, silky mouthfeel that is just gently chewy. Carbonation is middling with a soft prickly scrub on the palate. The mouth is left a little wet with saliva but only a soft astringency on the tongue, and little else. Overall, this is a nice porter. I could put a couple of these back on a cold winter’s day and be happy, and this would pair very nicely with a thick stew or shepherd’s pie. It’s not my favorite in the style, honestly, but I think that is because it is so classically “a porter” that it doesn’t stand out much to me. I would have this again for sure, but I don’t know if I would buy it again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,WheelsPSU,4.35,Seeing that Edmund Fitzgerald is not available in NY. I was able to snag a 6 pack as I was in NJ for the holidays. It did not disappoint.  Pours a dark brown with a rather large head that dissipated fairly quickly. There was not much lacing left behind.  The smell was delicious. Fresh brewed coffee house meets cacao nibs plus a small hint of espresso.  The taste was exactly like the smell but with a added bonus. It was nutty chocolate and roasted coffee upfront which eventually led to a caramel profile. There was not much hops but that didn't stop the beer from packing a delicious taste punch.  The finish was not dry nor bitter (even with the heavy coffee flavor).

73,226,Nugganooch,4.37,"On Tap at World of Beers in New Brunswick, NJ 12/11/13 – Standard pint glass  A: Black coffee colored body with a slight reddish brown as it thins out towards the edge. Thick layer of perfectly still khaki cream rests over the top and leaves some soft streamers of lace behind with a few dots mixed in as well. Looks magnificent really with a nice shiny gloss to it.  S: Smells of light coffee roast with equal parts cocoa nib coming together in unison. Mostly dark grains here with a touch of dark caramelized fruit sweetness and just a whisper of smoky char. Nice subtle and balanced roast character overall.  T: Again just a perfect marriage between some nutty bakers chocolate and a house blend coffee roast. Neither of which compete only compliment. Roasted grains are pronounced with a slight chocolate crème sweetness and a relatively low amount of bitterness to the beer. Hints of stone fruit in there and a dry earthy char at the finish. The alcohol is completely disguised making this entirely sessionable. Not getting any harsh notes at all. Very smooth, well balanced, robust, and delicious.  M: Moderate to lightly filling with a great creamy texture. Very clean overall. A touch watery on the finish but nothing to detract from the enjoyment.  D: This is the ideal porter. Epitomic. I can see why so many tout the flag for this one. It has great balance and perfect harmony of roasty flavors. One of the best Porters I have come across to date.

Not a whole lot of bitterness in the nose. Not overly complex, but very satisfying.  T: Lots of caramel and chocolate notes upfront with some sweetened dark roast coffee underneath. A very slight instance of hop bitterness cuts through at the very end, but is quickly squelched by a lingering mild sweetness combined with a sort of nutty character.  M: Slightly above medium body with exceptional creaminess throughout. Mild, controlled carbonation lets this one roll smoothly through your mouth.

Sweeter on the nose than one might expect, with milk chocolate and caramel malts giving way quickly to lightly roasted coffee. Not a terribly strong aroma. The taste follows the nose more or less: chocolate, caramel, roast malts with a slightly bitter coffee aftertaste that does quite linger as long as I want it to. It's nuanced and complex, but I'll agree with a previous review who called the flavors ""muted"" somewhat. It just doesn't have that big punch that I want in a porter.

The beer has impeccable clarity and when held to the light you can see the stream of bubbles rising in the center of the glass. Fat tan head of foam that falls well and leaves sheets of lace to fall back down into the beer as you drink. The suds refresh with each tip of the glass.  Nose is brilliant. Sophisticated roasted malt. Blackened, bready, but not crusted or burned. Toasted perfectly smooth. It has a the light scent of creamy caramel. A light touch of brown sugar, bold espresso that is smoothed out by dark bittersweet chocolate. It has a cookie like dryness even on the nose and a light and delicate hop herbal.  Taste is sensational. The malt rolls out of the glass, supple, creamy, like velvet. Soft and graceful. The caramel stays light and lightly sweet with a bit of nut to it and that sweet little bit of cream to fill up the palate. The coffee and the dark chocolate gives it oomf and a burly quality that is very dynamic. It finishes dry and with an endless grain. The hop herbal balances this perfectly for an aftertaste that is filled with soft dark bread. The body of the beer is medium and it approaches chewy but stays just shy of it. It has a little bit of thickness and it feels great on the palate.  This beer has a radiant and strikingly handsome appearance. The nose is dapper and full of rich deep scents.

Not overly powerful. Its not a double, so I guess that should be expected. Well rounded and soft. Dry. A session porter perhaps.  Little creamy. Light to medium carbonation. Super smooth.

73,226,Chiefy770,4.57,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: A very, very dark brown body, just a drop away from being black, sits under an off-white head. The head gives way to fantastic quantities of lacing throughout.  Smell: Mocha-like scent dominates the nose.  Taste: Medium body full of malts hit the tongue first. Great notes of semi-sweet chocolate start to come through. Mild hops come in and level out the heavy malts. This is nearly a perfectly balanced porter.  Mouthfeel: Dry and bittersweet finish. Low to moderate carbonation.  Overall: For many, this seems to be considered ""THE"" porter. There is a great variety of Porters out there but this seemed to live up to the hype. Despite the rather heavy flavor, this brew is easy to throw down, perhaps a session porter? I think yes.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

T - Heavy malt load - caramel, chocolate, balanced nicely with dry bitterness and a hint of licorice (anise), velvety mouth feel, medium bodied. Easy as hell to quaff this one down.

73,226,StonedTrippin,4.19,"one of the classic American porters here, a longtime staple of great lakes brewing. best on tap, it pours nearly black, not as thick as some, but impenetrable to light and sporting a cool inch of khaki head on it that leaves prominent lacing as it sips. massive dark roasted barley flavors, dry and bitter, with generous hops for the style. the ale yeast marries the grain perfectly, and its a really smooth a robustly flavored result, almost smoky, almost cocoay, almost charred. I really like the combination of depth of flavor and drinkability in this beer, which is only medium bodied, quick finishing for a porter, and ultra smooth texturally. well enough carbonated, this coal colored porter is a standby in colder weather for me, creamy and satisfying. definitely the beer by which all other American porters should be judged, it is spot on in every aspect. also great on a hangover!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Jeffreysan,3.68,"12 oz bottle, poured into a pint glass  Appearance: Pours an extremely dark, almost pitch black color, with a half of a finger of off-white head that dissolved into a thin lacing of foam that almost, but not completely covered the top of the beer in wispy clouds.  Aroma: Roasted malt and coffee beans. Dark chocolate and slightly burnt caramel. Smoke.  Taste: Very roasty up front, almost to the point of being too bitter, but not quite. Smoke, dark chocolate, almost burnt dark bread, coffee and molasses also appear.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full. Chewy. There is a little carbonation, but not a lot. With an ABV of 5.8%, this beer has a surprising higher alcohol presence on the palate than I expected.  Overall: This is a very good porter, but not one of my favorites. While I like the very slightly-bitter forward flavors of the beer, I didn’t love it. I prefer my porters to have just a little less roasted, smoky bitterness to them. This beer is nicely crafted, it’s just not one of my favorites.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,tronester,4.11,"Pours a brilliant black with clear ruby highlights. A medium tan head. Aromas of dark chocolate.

Tan head with good retention but sparse lacing. Chocolate and coffee aroma with soft caramel and toasted malts. Medium bodied with moderate sweetness. Smooth and lightly bitter in the finish.  When people ask what the difference is between a porter and a stout, this lacks the strong roasted malt quality that a stout does. To me, this is a benchmark porter and one of my favorites along with Smuttynose and Anchor, though it is a bit lighter bodied than both.

73,226,HattedClassic,4.26,"Appearance: The beer pours a nice fluffy dark tan head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a very dark brown with light hints of amber. The texture is a little bit glossy.  Smell: Hints of caramel malts, milk chocolate, and coffee notes. The beer also a bit of a smoky hint to it as well.  Taste: Primarily chocolate and caramel notes along with hints of coffee. Slight bitter hop taste at the end.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and biting carbonation. The feel is a bit thick but fairly easy to drink overall.  Overall: A very good porter that beats most porters that I've had.

73,226,BethanyB,3.98,"Appearance: A clear dark brown with ruby red highlights. The tan head is tightly beaded, yet quick to shrink. A good layer of lacing, however, is left on the glass,  Smell: A mild, evenly distributed mix of roasted malt, milk chocolate, prunes, and dark brown sugar. The bouquet sweetens and strengthens as the beer warms.  Taste: Roasted malt is the strongest taste, but is lightly sweetened by a background chocolate, and even caramel flavors. A bit of dark fruit is also present in the blend. Overall, the taste is delicately balanced, and more round than it is complex.  Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation make this darker beer feel lighter and easier to drink. The combination gives the brew a sessionable, spritzy feel that still fits the Porter profile.  Overall: A well crafted, if not terribly fascinating, robust porter. I would absolutely recommend this beer to almost anyone--it's a pretty safe and solid bet with lots of flavor for the ABV, making it an excellent sessionable choice.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

From what I'd heard, this was an astonishing porter, and while I'd never turn one down, it didn't quite blow me away. Lovely looking cola color. Slightly smoky taste and a slightly thin (for a porter) but lovely mouthfeel. Hints of coffee, chocolate, and a bit smoky. Not super bold but nicely balanced.

The foam fades away quickly leaving behind a few spots of lace and a thin sheet on the beer.  The aroma has nice notes of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, bread and an earthy nuttiness.  Each sip of this medium bodied beer is soft and watery with moderate carbonation. The flavor is similar to the nose, chocolate, roast malt, coffee, and nuts. It finishes mildly bitter with a touch of grassy hops. Once gone the chocolate, roast malt and hop bitterness lingers on the palate.  This is a very tasty porter that's easy to drink. Well balanced.

73,226,sjones5045,4.25,"So I have been very excited to try this beer. The Porter class is in my opinion the most under appreciated class in the beer world and its one of my favorites. I've heard great things about this beer so I cracked it with high hopes.  It's pours it he a deep dark brown carmel color, with an insane tan head for a porter. Probably the nicest looking porter inpve seen.  The smell is a bit different than any in this class. It's has a sweeter smell and not as bold as I'd expect. Not sure if this if its good or bad or indifferent, it's just off from a normal porter.  The taste is much like the smell. It's a sweet creamy porter that start and ends sweet. The big thing here missing for me is the classic burnt chocolate/coffee taste I love about a porter. It has a hint of it at the end but the sweet takes charge if this beer and hide the burnt chocolate in this case.  Th mouthfeel is really good. It's very smooth, rich and creamy. The aftertaste is excellent, with a bit of a sweet hop taste left over.  Overall, it's an excellent porter, but far different than the porters I love. I think the only miss is the burnt chocolate taste I've come to expect for a porter. This would be a different food pairing, almost closer to a dessert type beer although not quit that sweet. So basically, I really haven't decided on the niche for this, but its not the fall eating chilli type porter that I expect from the class. That said its a very well put together beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The beer has almost an herbal bitterness that really picks up the beer despite it lack of creaminess.  The flavor are quite good on this beer, and the highlight is the bitterness.

When held to the light there was dark mahogany highlights around the glass and where the light was coming through. Very nice light brown microbubble 1+ finger head with some medium bubbles throughout. Big chunky lacing as I drink.  This beer smells amazing. A lot of toffee and freshly ground coffee beans. Absolutely delicious smelling!  The taste is very good as well. Tastes like it smells with toffee up front. A little coffee coming through and some roasted/burnt malt. It seems I'm tasting a little nuttiness at the end.  The mouthfeel is perfect for this beer. Its medium-heavy bodied. A little chewy and coats the mouth nicely.  The drinkability is as good as you can get for a porter.  Overall Edmund Fitzgerald is an excellent beer. Pick it up if you see it cause you will be pleased.

Not as thick as i thought but thats not a strike againsted it at all. No real head formation for me...but I dont really geek out on that, specially for porters.  On first taste: I have to admit, this is my second try at this brew. The first, it just didnt stand out to me (was tasting a tons of beers that day). But I can say now...I agree with most others on this brew. It is a water mark for porters....if someone were to ask me for a standard porter; I would give them this.

Medium nutty accents and oaky malt fill up a full bodied flavor. Sweet flavors pop up all over the place and surprise the palette. This beer lights up on the back end and leaves a sugary feeling behind.  Mouthfeel: rich, creamy, smooth, and delicious.  Overall: its either this or founders porter as the best in the business. Porters can go too far on the malt or sweet side but this one is right on point. Simply outstanding.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,boilermakerbrew,4.52,"A- Pours a deep, deep brown color with hints of red peaking through the edges. When held up to the light, a little bit gets through, and a little bit of clarity is distinguishable. Medium sized, 2 finger head that is somewhere between off-white and tan. Retention and lacing are phenomenal.  S- Big coffee malts are the main scent. Coffee and big, roasted malts intermingle to create an overall dark, bitter smell. No chocolate or sweet tones in this one. Maybe a hint of smoke in with all of the dark malts.  T- Starts out big and bitter with moderate to strong coffee flavors. Coffee is not overpowering, but it is dominant. This coffee flavor persists through most of the drink, with a slight transition to dark malts. The smokey flavor from the scent is more pronounced in the taste, and when mixed with the coffee and dark malts, the combination produces a flavor similar to tobacco. Fades out in the end, with coffee flavors lingering on the palate.  M- Low to medium carbonation, but thinner and lighter than expected. This is a beer that would be easy to have a few of at the bar. Heavier flavor profile makes it somewhat less drinkable than it would otherwise be, but not much so.  Overall, this is a pretty awesome everyday porter. Great coffee and dark malt flavors. My only criticism of this beer is that the feel is slightly thin and watery compared to other porters and stouts. I would definitely drink this regularly if my regular bar was in the distribution footprint.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Taste: Chocolate and coffee followed by the same dark fruit in the aroma, really both unique and exceptional for a porter. Very well balanced complexity and rich flavor.

Aroma: Earthy roasty aroma upfront with a very subtle maltiness following. Possible hoppiness from earthy/woody hoppy aromas present. Flavor: Roasty/charcoal up front. Malty sweetness WELL balanced by acidity of dark malts. Sweet and sour pungent hop flavor in finish. Subtle/earthy/cloying hop flavor in finish For the roast flavors there it is fantastic but could use more depth. Perhaps layering of some of the dark malts. No diacetyl. Light dark esters of cherry and grape that are a secondary note to the malt flavors. Mouthfeel: Medium heavy to medium mouth feel with moderate carbonation. Light acidity on the tongue for overall balance. Overall: A very pleasant classic example of a robust porter VERY subtly lacking of complexity.

Smooth malt backbone, not very much smokiness. So well balanced and drinkable, once it warms a little it starts to bring out the milk chocolate taste, almost tastes like a chocolate milk shake with some added coffee flavor!  mouthfeel: full and average carbonation, very thick creamy feel  overall: Did a blind test with Founder's Porter, Bells Porter, and Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald. This slightly nudged the Founders (which was a lot smokier and hoppier), as it was just smooth as you can get in a porter. Highly drinkable, perhaps my favorite porter.

73,226,magictacosinus,4.57,"Poured into a shaker pint at the Map Room in Chicago.  Pours a darkish, near opaque color that reveals slight reddish transparency when held against the light. Not much of a head to speak of, although carbonation is still decent and attempts to hold up well here. There's some dripped, slightly cobwebby lacing that goes all around the glass's edges, which adds slight character. Looks like a classic American porter all around.  Whoa! The aroma completely caught me by surprise here. Very robust, full bodied, and juicy unlike any porter I've had to date. Chocolate nibs, cracked roasted barley, vanilla, cream, and berries (blueberries in particular). Not much coffee is present here, to my surprise. As this warms up, the chocolate aspects become far more accentuated and meld with the vanilla notes in almost a dessert-like manner. Luckily, the barley flavor and slight hoppy bitterness keep this from becoming too sweet, and provide a combination of a bready, toasted character combined with all of the chocolate and dark fruitiness.  The flavor only makes things better, really. The chocolate is ever more present (think semi-dark), and combined with the vanilla and big dark berry flavors, it almost resembles the texture and thickness of a cake or brownie of sorts. There is finally some coffee that creeps in towards the finish, which adds a little bitterness to the otherwise well atoned flavors that range back and forth from dessert sweetness to the cracked barley character. Hops lie beneath all of these flavors, but they are by no means muted – there's a subtle hint of grassiness at the finish here. However, the chocolate and vanilla creaminess are the really the highlights here, and really in ways I haven't had an American porter before.  This is awesome! I should have invested in a 6-pack of this during my stay, but I had too many beers I wanted to try. This is exactly like a hearty stout without being nearly as heavy on body or senses, yet still tenfold in flavor. Not sure how they did it, but I think the well rounded carbonation, as well as the excellent ingredients they're using here, helped it out. While I'm glad I get stuff like, say, Black Butte Porter out West, I want more of these sometime!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,downeyj4,5,"Overall, the best Porter out there. It has a blackish/caramel brown color. It smells like roasted malts with a hint of chocolate.

Beer is pretty dark brown (I'm guessing about 27 SRM) with red shining through in the light. It's not particularly viscus. The head died pretty quick and left a blanket on the beer.  Smells great. Not a huge nose, but I get roasted notes all over the place. Dark roasted (but not bitter) barley, dark roasted coffee, a little bit of vanilla, a little bit of roasted chestnut, a little bit of smoke. Very delicate.  I taste that roastiness too! A rather dry flavor. Roast malt, coffee, and some nuttiness. A little hoppiness is left on the tongue after each sip. Extremely well balanced and very relaxing to drink.

73,226,barczar,4.2,"Pours an opaque deep brown with amber highlights and a frothy half inch tan head that slowly dissipates, leaving sheets of lacing.  Chocolate, roast malt, and coffee grounds dominate the initial aroma. Notes of nuttiness, caramel sweetness, and citrus add complexity, with a hint of resin emerging late.  Flavor reveals more floral hop character at first, which ushers in chocolate and is eventually overpowered by deeply roasted malt and coffee. There's an underpinning of subtle dark fruit. The finish is somewhat bitter and fairly nutty. It's borderline acrid, but the nutty character saves the experience.  Body is a touch full, fairly creamy, with low carbonation and a hint of an acrid bite.  I didn't recall as much floral hop character, but it makes things interesting. The roast malt and coffee are kept in check fairly well. Would like a touch more chocolate. The underlying fruity notes are nice.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

It has a nice tan head that contrasts wonderfully with the virtually black coloring.  Smell: Mostly coffee, but it is far from overwhelming or obnoxious.

Nice mocha colored head, about one inch. Small amount of lacing.  Lots of coffee and chocolate aromas in this one- don't think either is added, so it's all from the high quality roasted malt here.  The taste is similar. Perfect amount of roasty bitterness is cut by chocolate and vanilla sweetness. Some coffee-like flavors also provide a bit of bitterness. Slightly lactic twang at the end of each sip is very nice. Hop flavors are muted but still present.  Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel, very drinkable.

Roasted coffee bean aroma. Vanilla. Cream. Slightly nutty. Vague hint of dark fruits like raisin and figs. Smells very enticing. Has a strong aroma yet has a lot of very distinct smelling parts to it.  T - Smooth, creamy, chocolate coffee bean flavor. Taste is definitely jam packed with flavor. Bitter roasted coffee beans, silky chocolate, roasted oats and malts, vague hop bitterness. Subtle brown sugar sweetness. There is a lot going on here. An excellent tasting beer.  M - Feel is creamy, silky, smooth, and light. Some coffee bean / hop bitterness lingers out for a little while. Very excellently balanced and bodied, with hardly any noticeable carbonation at all.  Overall, an excellent beer, and highly recommended. Since I discovered them about two years ago, Great Lakes has ceased to disappoint me.

73,226,Stevedore,4.31,"12oz bottle served at Craftsman Table and Tap with a house tulip glass, consumed 2/27/2013 (going off notes from my napkin)  Aroma: Smells fantastic. Roasted malt, dark chocolate, burnt sugar. Somehow it all comes together to make this a true pleasure to smell.  Colour: Pours a nice dark black with a 2 finger beige head that sticks around for a minute or so before disappearing into a small foaming film covering the surface. Illuminates cola brown. Lacing forms a nice collar, spreads when swirled.  Flavour: Really fantastic, it somehow comes together better than the nose does. Dark roasted malt contribution gives quite a bit of chocolate, a little bit of black coffee, hints of caramel and burnt sugar. Really a complex, sweet flavour for a Porter. I love it!  Mouthfeel: Medium body on the thicker side, very easy to drink this beer. Carbonation is good, just right. The aftertaste gives me a lot of chocolate and a little bit of pine, and doesn't linger too long with a dry finish. Very sessionable yet tasty. Can't do much better in this category. It could be more creamy like the Black Butte can get, though.  Overall: This is going to be my go-to porter. Easy to get, easy to drink, easy to appreciate. For a porter, it packs a quite a bit of the complex character and the flavours I love the most in general- chocolate and coffee especially. I can get it for $7.49/6pk here in Madison, WI and there's no question that's one the best values I've come across.

The smell is superb and gives hints of chocolate and malt. I found that the taste was slightly behind the smell but not far. It still has a great taste and a nice chocolaty finish. I found this beer to be a great go-to even when other Porters or Stouts are available. I think I will add this to the ""grab it if they've got it"" list for my wife when she makes her trips to the store for me.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Great complex, nuanced, and full bodied flavor gives way to a spicy, cherry and floral aftertaste. Finishes strong.

73,226,hagbergl,4.12,"I bought a six-pack of this venerable, much-hailed Porter at the liquor store in Kimbark Plaza, Hyde Park, Chicago a while back and am finally getting to the review. Twelve oz. brown bottle with ""Enjoy By 3/27/13"" printed on the label served in my Chimay chalice.  Appearance (4/5): Edmund Fitzgerald is dark brown, almost black, and you can see red-brown highlights when holding the beer up to the light. It is topped by a one-finger khaki head of creamy foam that recedes quickly. A good looking Porter, but I would have liked to see a more generous, longer-lived head.  Smell (3.75/5): EF features aromatic notes of dark fruit, mainly raisins, dark chocolate, burnt malt, roasty, nutty. Not especially pungent, but nicely balanced and inviting enough. No booze (not that you thought there'd be any in a beer clocking in at 5.8% ABV) and none of that off-putting metallic smell that spells spoilage. Good enough.  Taste (4.25/5): EF really scores well in the category of true consequence: taste! It's roasty, features a light hop bitterness, and plenty of black coffee, chocolate, dark bread, and fruity raisin-like flavors. A tad of caramel sweetness lurks in there. Light burnt malt, a touch of smoke, and also tad nutty. This is a nicely complex, yet balanced American Porter. Very tasty and, I have to say, the flavor is more interesting than the smell. I really am enjoying how well the beer warms and how easy-drinking it is.  Mouthfeel (4.25/5): Medium carbonation, medium body, appropriate to a porter. Light bitterness works the palate only moderately. The beautiful thing about this beer is that it goes down easy–it's just so slick and smooth on the tongue. Drinkability is exceptional.  Overall (4.25/5): Edmund Fitzgerald is a very good American Porter. It is nicely complex yet beautifully balanced and features a great array of flavors. Very drinkable and tasty. Though perhaps not as incredible, in my opinion, as the BA score indicates, it is an outstanding value and one of those perfect beers for the cold weather.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,57md,3.87,"Appearance was chocolate brown with a finger of tan head. There was little retention of the head and only a minimal amount of lace remaining on the glass.

Lucky to find an ultra fresh 6 pack, with a best by date of June 9, 2013, at The Party Source in Bellevue, KY on New Year's Eve. I can never find this beer, fresh or otherwise. It doesn't stay on the shelves long enough to collect dust.  Having enjoyed it before, i'm going to review this now.  Great pour into my Samuel Adams Perfect Glass. Nice frothy head on top of a dark as cola body. The beer might have chilled too long, because the smell has a light roastiness to it -- not characteristic of a world class porter, as the scores on BA would indicate.  Taste... maybe it's too fresh, because this beer tastes kind of green. Mouthfeel is thin also.  In conclusion, this is a very nice beer, but hardly world class.

A thin, light, filmy, off-white head quickly settles into a surface coating. Aromas of rich cocoa and baker's chocolate, with an undertone of roast coffee. A very rich and balanced nose. Flavors ride a sharp, crisp body, with roast coffee in the forefront, supported by bittersweet chocolate deep in the backbone. Very light, crisp body propelling the flavors across the palate. The dominating bitter from the coffee and chocolate holds strong through the aftertaste, with a touch of milk chocolate dipped at the end.

73,226,DocJitsu,3.66,"Pours an opaque very dark brown with glints of cola brown around the bottom edge when held to the light. Coffee and a bit of cocoa on the nose. Thicker consistency, but too much carbonation too quickly. Big coffee flavor. Some lactose, but not enough, in my opinion. The coffee flavor is nice, but the coffee acidity is barely tempered by the creaminess. The carbonation tends to overpower the lactose feel and flavor. It's ok. I was excited to get the chance to try it again. I'd had it several years ago. But, more recently, there's been quite a bit of hype about it. I don't feel it's lived up to it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Thin tan lacing never fades, lingers on top and on the glass.  Mostly chocolate in the nose. A hint of coffee and roasted malt, but chocolate is most noticeable.  No single element of the taste really stands out, but taken as a whole it is delightful. Does not try to do too much. Roasted malt up front, with some bitterness. Bittersweet chocolate and some coffee in the middle. Finishes with some faint sweetness and roastiness. Finish is fantastic.  Mouthfeel really sets this one apart for me. Incredibly refreshing. Finish lingers pleasantly. A fair amount of carbonation, which I usually do not like, but it works here. Coating. Could drink many.  Overall, exactly what I want from a porter. Mellow and understated, but makes me want more.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Smell- I mostly noticed cocoa powder and fresh coffee grounds.  Taste- Fair amount of hops upfront subsiding into a mix of chocolate and coffee. And I do mean a mix; I couldn't really say one overpowered the other, the chocolate and coffee were equally present. Lingering, sort of bready aftertaste.  Mouthfeel- Thick body, medium carbonation; satisfying. Taste sticks around for a while.  Overall- A great beer, full-bodied and flavorful .

Had about two and a half fingers of rich mocha head that dissipated slowly, and left fine lacing to the finish.  Aroma is underwhelming, but not bad. Easy coffee notes.  The taste is very good, really stoutlike. It has a clean start with a hint of bitter hops, middle is clean and mellow, with a roasted coffee finish. I think I could even find some chocolate notes at times throughout.  Across the tongue, it is really mellow as well. it has a bit of a bite, and a dry finish.

Fairly solid cap remains throughout, providing some moderate lacing.  S - Toasted and smoky goodness. Bitter chocolate, and a very light hint of some coffee.

Slightly bitter coffee taste upfront with a lingering coco flavor on the back-end.

Great lacing  Aroma: dark Chocolate, raisins, bit of coffee  Taste: roasted barley, but not astringent. Nicely balanced. Dark chocolate notes a little subdued compared to aroma. Smooth French roast coffee comes through.  Mouthfeel: Tiny tingling bubbles, and then an extremely smooth, wet feel, ending with some residual smooth coffee bitter. Not too thick. Really easy drinking  Overall: First sip I thought was a bit thin. Used to stouts. But now that I’ve had a few more, I think it's renewed a love in porters.

Nice lacing on the glass. S: Hops and roast, maybe a bit of coffee too. Nice. T: The thing about this beer is it's a perfect blend of roast and hops. The roast is mildly coffee; the hops are distincly earthy and piney. This is a refreshing beer too surprisingly, the hops are very bright and at the forefront. Not too bitter either, just a bit of light toffee sweetness. If anything, it could pop a bit more with roast flavors, but that's really splitting hairs. M: Medium/medium-light; makes the beer very drinkable. No faults here. O: A great beer, you can have several of these with no problems, not super interesting but no real issues. Very well balanced. Love Great Lakes, this might be my favorite that they make.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

No real hop presence to speak of. T: While the caramel tones from the aroma are there, a nice roasted coffee quality becomes apparent. Roast, but without any real acrid bitterness. Hops balance out the finish with some flavor and dry bitterness. The parts all work together. M: Full and well carbonated. At first glance, the carbonation gave the beer and head an almost cola-like appearance. O: Solid porter. Very well balanced. Each piece leads into the next with nothing dominating. I can see this becoming a regular beer to keep on hand.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Appearance: The liquid flows out of the bottle in a darkish brown shade, but amasses into the cup in a very dark brown bordering on black. Head is about a finger and a half of tan. Lacing is decent.  Smell: Coffee and roasted malts pummel the nose. If I strain I think I can smell some faint hops.  Taste: Very bitter - intense coffee flavor and again, the roasted malts. Notes of chocolate and licorice. This guy is really on the astringent side of bitter coffee.  Mouthfeel: A little thin, especially for the style. Adequate carb levels.  Drinkability: Moderate to low - I don't mind one, but that astringency in the coffee is a little much for multiples.  Overall: This is a decent beer, but it's nothing to write home about.

Finishes with a fairly-full flavor and lingering roasted and hop bitterness. Good job.  M - Medium body and medium high carbonation. Not as thick as a Founders Porter  O - I'd say this is my favorite from this brewery and a close second to Founders Porter.  Notes: In October, 2018 my wife thought Founders Porter was too thick and too challenging flavor-wise. This was better for her but still too much.

S: There is lots of coffee upfront, but that fades into a creamy smell that ends with a slight node of dark chocolate. There is also some roasted malt in there i think.  T: Perhaps I mistakes the coffee up front as I can taste the bitterness but I don't get that full bodied coffee flavor that I was expecting. The dark chocolate is definitely present throughout that blends nicely with the roasted malt flavor, which i usually don't like but in this one I do. Not what i was expecting but I really like it.  M: The Mouthfeel is really smooth creamy and rich, but not too thick. The abv definitely allows this to go down way easier then most porters  O: I like this one, but i definitely like the thicker more robust porters better.

Caramel and toffee notes, bit of coffee and chocolate as well. Taste is very much like the smell. Has a bit of a hop bite at the end, giving it a bit of a bitter aftertaste.  Goes down full and smooth, with a little bite from the carbonation.  I would have to say this is the best porter I have tried. Nice balance of flavors, not too dry, not too bitter.

73,226,shand,4.37,"Edmund Fitzgerald pours out a deep brown color capped with a small head. The aroma is nice and roasty, with chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. The taste is excellent, it's got such a strong and well-balanced coffee and chocolate aspect that calls back to my first introduction to porters and stouts. To bring that kind of flavor intensity after how far my beer journey has progressed is impressive to say the least. It doesn't go beyond the base porter flavors of roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate, but it does it so well. The mouthfeel is spot on, it's medium bodied and the carbonation level perfectly compliments the flavor. The drinkability is very good. Edmund Fitzgerald is just a world-class porter. It doesn't venture outside the box of what a porter should offer, but is so refined that I can't help but wonder how any other porters sell in areas that Edmund Fitzgerald is available.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,tectactoe,4.14,"Pours a deep black with a very faint hit of dark brown along the edges. Tan colored head that mellows out to a thin span across the top of the beer leaving very little lacing on the way down. Initial smell is heavy chocolate and roasted malts, kind of had to coax it out. After the beer warmed up a bit and the glass was swirled, I started to get heavier notes of sweetness from the malts as well as some rich and milky smells. Incredible.  The taste is wonderful. First sip gives a huge roasted malt flavor up front, with a bit of a carbonation snap to it. After a little bit, more flavors start to develop: burnt campfire wood, nuttiness, sweet coffee beans, roasted grains. At the end of the sip, out comes an ever-so-slight yet still very noticeable bite from the hops, to finish the beer off with a nice floral touch. Honestly, the bitterness from the hops at the end, along with the malts and the sweetness of the chocolate is incredible - very nearly perfect in balance. Slightly creamy, but a little thin for what I was expecting.  Lovely porter, here. Great balance, great drinkability, and overall just a great beer. Anyone looking for a top-of-the-line porter should look no further (unless they haven't already had Founders Porter). Great price, easy to find, and more than enough to fulfill your dark and roasted malty needs. Give this one a shot and thank me later.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,argock,4.3,"Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a clear slightly tapered stemmed clear goblet. Best by 5/11/2013 on bottle neck. Purchased at Binny's Liquors (Chicago, IL) for $9.49.  A: Pitch black with 1-2 finger beige foamy head with good retention and plenty of craggy lace.  S: Roasty dark maltiness dominates with quite a bit of American hoppiness with orange and grapefruit. The dark malts also provide some plum and fig notes along with some coffee and chocolate character.  T: The flavor has significant gravity with big dark chocolate and strong coffee followed by dark fruit notes such as plum, fig, and raisin that finishes with crisp American C-type hoppiness with grapefruit and orange citrus along with light floral character. The dryness of the finish is helped by the roasted notes.  M: Medium-bodied with lively carbonation and undeniable smoothness.  O: A superb example of an American semi-robust porter: big dark fruit and roasty notes without being over the top, finished with American hoppiness. I enjoyed this beer, and I wish that I had gotten a chance at this a long time ago. Superb brew and deserving of the love it gets.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Not as velvety as a stout yet very pleasing.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Taste: Lots of roasted dark chocolate throughout and a nice coffee bitterness in the finish. The definition of a classic porter. It's great in it's simplicity. Nice roasted malt character and pretty straightforward.  Mouthfeel: A tad below medium bodied and slightly over carbonated for my taste. Easily drinkable.  Final Thoughts: Definitely worth a try if it's distributed in your area. The aftertaste is reminiscent of a mocha and lingers for a while. Would I drink it again? Maybe, it's not first on my list of go-to porters.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S: smells strong of coffee, chocolate, caramel, malts, vanilla, very aromatic, gives me the sensation of morning, wakes me up  T: coffee, dark chocolate, some hops, smokey, wood, very bold  M: it is wonderful, good carbonation, very bold and thick, gives the feeling of actually drinking coffee, that sort of thickness, the after taste leaves with the temptation for more.  O: A wonderful beer, the atmosphere that I had created, the gordon lightfoot song was perfect, might have made it taste better, but it is a great porter and its wonderful that its in tribute of the late Edmund Firtzgerald.

A: I always find it difficult to rate stouts/porters on appearance...it's black...they're all black...but the head is a beautiful, light-brown that hangs on throughout the whole beer, which makes me give it a few more points.  S: Almost like a stout, a lot of roasted notes....and I mean A LOT....very enticing aroma with a hint of caramel and chocolate.  T: Only reason I don't give this a 5 is, as some fellow advocates have pointed out, it has a slight metal taste...could just be my bottle or taste buds though.  M: Velvety. Very clean.

Aroma of dark chocolate and espresso. Tons of roast character and just a little bit of spicy hops.  Flavor is really where this beer stands out. Ridiculous amount of roast, chocolate, and coffee without a bitter, astringent mouthfeel which is hard to do. A real nice balance between chocolate and coffee with some hints of caramel thrown in. Mouthfeel is just a little on the thin side which is about the only drawback.  Really a world-class beer here. Just an amazing aroma and flavor without crazy amount of alcohol or bitterness. Everyone should try this beer at least once.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,zaphodchak,3.29,"Thick tan head and a dark dark brown body. Nice lacing. Enjoyed a month past it's 'best by' date, fwiw.  Nose is kinda malty, almost a bit briny. Maybe it's the ship on the bottle. Not great, but not offensive.  There's some kinda tart, Orangina-eqsue taste going on here. Maybe it's just me. Some kinda weird metallic tang. But once you get past that, it's robust and malty, and pretty well balanced. I am thinking now that the metallic flavor (which lingers) could be some muted hops. Bit of a warming at the back of your mouth.  This has a good body-- strong and robust, thick, but with some pretty bright carbonation.  This is not the type of porter I normally go for. It's more American (and slightly more steely/bitter) than I prefer, although it is certainly robust enough to be enjoyable for what it is. Could be something off with my bottle, or off with me. I will say that having read more into the reviews of this (and some comparisons), I would order a Founders Porter over this any day of the week. Does that mean Founders' is objectively better? No, just that I prefer it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Wolfee02,5,"First off I would like to say that this is the only beer I have ever had where I can confidently say that it is the greatest beer in the world! It has the perfect balance of feel and an amazing taste. I have tried many porters but none like this! Once again Great Lakes proves that they are one of the best breweries this world has to offer. This beer is jet black. It appears like a dark black with a golden head, it pours an inch and half or so of head. It smells fantastic! Almost like brown sugar, coffee beans and chocolate. This is one of the best tasting beers I have ever had! The taste is one of a kind really, just like the smell! It is as smooth as a box of chocolates or a refreshing cup of coffee. Overall I recommend this and the Great Lakes vareity pack to anyone who loves great beer! The variety pack contains 4 world class brews!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Malty/nutty aroma to it, and I just love the taste of it. Super robust flavor and great full mouth feel. This is probably my favorite porter of all time. Full flavor profile full of chocolate, nuts and coffee on the tail end.

A: Pours an extremely dark brown with a wonderful centimeter of tan, frothy, creamy head. The head definitely adds an aesthetic that seems to promise a delicious beer.  S: Fairly strong roasty notes with hints of chocolate and coffee beans. Smells a little smoky, in a good way.  T: Does not taste as good as I remember it, but it is still damn good. Basically tastes like everything the smell promised. Good notes or roastiness, coffee, and chocolate.  M: Really good mouthfeel for a porter. Creamier than a lot of porters I've had with a tad bit of prickly carbonation. Goes down the throat very smoothly.

73,226,SerialTicker,4.09,"Ordered on-tap at Olives in Roseville, MI.  Appearance: A pretty perfect looking porter. Pitch black color. A beautiful little head on it. Great lacing throughout the glass.  Smell: Not bad, not great. I didn't get much. It sort of is similar to the taste, but more muted.  Taste: Easily the best porter I've had. I haven't had many, but I HAVE had Founders Porter, and this trumps that without question. There's almost a slight earthy flavor upfront, with that great, to-be-expected coffee and chocolate flavor through the rest of the sip. Really great.  Mouthfeel: Probably because I had it on tap, but creamy and delicious, like a good porter should be.  Overall, one of the best beers I've had, period. I drank this with FISH AND CHIPS and loved every last drop of it. There's really nothing bad to be said about Edmund Fitzgerald, but it does have me wondering. Why does ""Great Lakes Brewing Company"" exist in OHIO when they have ONE Great Lake bordering their state? Also, the Edmund Fitzgerald sunk in Lake Superior -- a Great Lake nowhere near Ohio. While I don't get the reasoning for the name of the brewery or the beer, this is still quality.  (4.53/5)  Update: 11/16/13... I had three of these tonight after picking up a six pack, and I have to say that this doesn't taste like I remembered, but more like I figured it should, given the fact that it's a porter. First of all, the flavor is lighter than I remember. There's also more carbonation, and there's a smokey character to it that I don't recall getting. It's still a really tasty beer, but really not nearly as awesome as I initially thought. Maybe it's because I got it on tap the first time, but yeah. For a porter, it's on-point. With a name like Edmund Fitzgerald though, I'd expect it to be a stout... really heavy, thick, and high ABV. Definitely one of the best porters I've had, but it's not what I remember. I will repeat again saying that this is a great sessionable porter with a nice smokey twist. P.S., I've found out why this beer is called Edmund Fitzgerald. I'm an idiot.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jwhancher,4.15,"A: Pours a very dark amber which appears brown with nice fluffy off-white, tan head. Good carbonation persists.  S: Upfront I get a nice mixture of roasted and chocolate malts. Subtle little hop character in the back. Almost a crisp smokey character seems to be evident.  T & M: Chocolaty with great mouthfeel. Feel medium with a nice milkshake-like texture. Even balance of roast, base malt, and hop character which seems to reside in the back but definitely makes itself known at the tail end of things. Could be a little more complex, but everything is well balanced and nicely done.  O: Another nicely done beer by Great Lakes. This is a tops porter in my opinion.

M: Very smooth, especially up front. Not much carbonation and very little hop finish.  D: High. Not overwhelmingly good, but better than I remember it being the first time around.

Elements of coffee and chocolate are not very distinguishable, fusing together in delicious fashion. Again, a light floral bitterness towards the end, but not much.  Mouthfeel: Wow, this is awesome.

Smell – The aroma is a wonderful mix of roasted malt and chocolate as well as a light caramel sweetness. With these aromas is a very light dark fruit aroma of plum and raisin as well. Overall the aroma is nice and sweet.  Taste – The taste begins with nice roasted malt and some slightly bitter coffee notes. As the taste advances a sweeter chocolate flavor greets the tongue. The chocolate is soon complemented with some dark fruit as well as caramel flavors. These sweeter caramel and dark fruit flavors last to the end, but there they end up fading, resulting, in the end, a nice semi-sweet cocoa flavor that is left to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel –The body of the brew was on the average to slightly above average side with a carbonation level that was on the slightly lower side. While the body was lighter then would have been nice for the roasty and cocoa flavors, the carbonation was right on par. While the body was lighter, when complemented with the carbonation and smooth flavors, it did make for a very easy drinking porter.

Leaves a decent amount of lacing, mostly in the bottom of the glass. Smells of dark fruits, slight vanilla, toasted malt, toasted caramel, and slight coffee. The taste hits you with a strong coffee flavor upfront, followed by a hit of burnt malt and dark fruit. Finishes with a medium bitterness.

Not much of a hop presence in the nose. Really the big aromas are rich chocolate and darker roasted coffee, a little bit of caramel malts.  Taste is equally as good as the smell, maybe even a little better. Chocolate profile is a little different than the nose here. It's more of a bitter sweet than just sweet. Still a strong portion of coffee as well, dark roasted. Slightly weaker hints of dehydrated fruit again, really well balanced and well blended flavor. Can't really taste the hops but you can tell there present.  Mouthfeel is very good. For something that has really good flavor the feel is only medium which is nice, not too easy to do for a lot of porters I feel.

73,226,GR_Rick,4.53,"12 oz bottle dated ""enjoy by 11/22/12"".  A: Pours very dark with a nice, thick tan colored head. A bit of transparency (red) through the light, but hard to see anything but dark brown/black without some effort. Beautiful small ""wispy"" foam sticks around on the top leading to very nice lacing as the beer is consumed. One of more appealing looking beers I've ever had.  S: Nice, clean roasty smell. Almost like burnt coffee, but not a bad smell at all. i could smell this beer all day.  T: Follows the nose almost exactly. A little bit of bitterness on the back end of the sip, which goes away rather quickly in favor of some fantastic dark, roasty notes, which linger for some time. I get a little bit of sweetness mid-palate, and kept thinking I was getting some metallic notes toward the back of the sip, but they never sustained, so I'm not knocking this beer for that.  M: Nice and thick (thicker than I expected) body, which I love. Thicker and more creamy than many stouts. Moderate carbonation, which fits well with the beer. I don't usually like carbonation in darker beers, but it really works well here.  O: Really, really nice beer. I can see why it's so highly regarded. Really nothing I can find here that I don't like. The only negative I can come up with, and i'm stretching for one, is the lack of flavor complexity. This is really more of a personal preference, as I really enjoy barrel aged beers that pull out hints of vanilla, bourbon, coffee, etc. I'm getting less complexity here, but the beer is spot on for what it's meant to be. For me, this will now be the Porter against which all others are judged. Excellent brew, and a fantastic way to end my night. I'll definitely be buying this again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,KajII,3.9,"[Best served in a Nonic Pint Glass]  The pour was a deep dark pitch black with a huge (3-4 finger) medium tan frothy head that was fully lasting and possessed excellent streaky lacing.  The aroma was of roasted chocolate malt and leathery yeast with notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, molasses and a touch of smoke.  The taste was very malty with a mild sweet chocolate note at first, but then the taste shifted slightly to a mild bitterness with a good strong coffee presence and a light sweet molasses ending. The flavor hung on for a very long time proceeding the swallow with a nice bitter coffee taste left to linger on the taste buds.  Mouthfeel was almost full in body with a dry oily texture and a medium carbonation.  Overall this is a great tasting Porter that was quite easy going down and had an exceptional bold robust flavor, making this one hek of an enjoyable drinking experience…",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BeerNoobNC,4.2,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color typical of a porter. Overall, a pretty typical porter, where there is nothing unique compared to others (like some porters have strong coffee tastes). However, this porter is very well done. Great malt taste with just a hint of hops and chocolate that all blends together very well. It is definitely one of the better porters I have had, and I would highly recommend it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

There's also a hint of dried dark fruit here, mostly prunes and raisins. More earthy and nutty as it warms. Dark bitter chocolate too.  Taste is bitter chocolate and roasted malt with a dry finish. Cocoa, dark fruit, black coffee.  Mouthfeel is where this beer really shines. It slips effortlessly across the palate and finishes bone dry. Good carbonation. Slight bitter aftertaste.

73,226,drewsefs,4.82,"This is easily one of the best brews i have had in my lifetime. Sitting around a campfire on a chilly summer day, and this beer warmed my stomach. The mouthfeel of this beer was dark chocolate and coffee. It was the original taste of this brew which initially made me fall in love with it. The deep taste which consists almost strictly of a darker coffee flavor and aroma strikes me as the type of beer that i would legitimately consider drinking for breakfast as a pick-me-up (i say that without feeling like an alcoholic). And being from Ohio, i feel a strange attachment to this Cleveland spawned porter, I have pride that Ohio has created one of the greatest beer i have ever had.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,ThisWangsChung,4.22,"Poured into a Williamsburg Winery wine glass.  A: Pours a dark brown body betrayed by its ruby red edges near the glass. It also features a three finger light mocha colored head with a nice frothy texture and spots of decent lacing.  S: Chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit, coffee, brown sugar, and a touch of earth. Really fantastic; proof that an excellent smelling beer doesn't need to be in your face to impress.  T: This is a porter that eschews boldness for subtlety, and it's all the better for it. An initial wave of chocolate hits the tongue, followed by notes of coffee, roast, smoke, raisin, hazelnut; while the finish sees a return of the coffee notes along with a slight noble hop component. Finish lasts a long time, as well. One of the more complex porters I've had, yet all of the notes in the flavor profile are balanced with one another. Only real flaw is that mine was served a bit too warm, and it negatively affected the flavor slightly; 'course it's not like it really matters...  M: Has a medium body, with a dry, long lasting, bittersweet finish and decent carbonation. A textbook porter in this regard.  O: If you want proof that a light(er) beer can satisfy as well as some of the big, bruising behemoths in the beer world, look no further than this bad boy.

S: Overall the aroma of this beer was quite mild, not as intense as I would have liked. There is pleasant roasted malt body with some nice chocolate hints. Subtle coffee hints are present as well.  T: A wonderfully robust, complex, and well balanced to the flavor of this beer. Strong roasted malt flavors with notes of bittersweet chocolate and subtle coffee hints.  M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth and creamy with just a hint of dryness in the finish.

It lingers around for some time. The lacing around the glass as it falls is really impressive. A massive collar rims the beer.  S: Grass, coffee, chocolate malt and a touch of authentic pit smoke.  T: Not too far of a stretch from the nose. Lots of medium roast black coffee, milk chocolate, buttered toast and char. What really stands out is the control: I don't get even a trace of that green quality that has become so prevalent in a lot of mid to low grade stouts and porters.  M: A bit bubbly at first. Letting this sit and warm helps, as does a few swirls in my glass. Within 15-20 minutes, this opens up and as the carbonation falls, the viscosity rises.  O: Searching for a great everyday Porter? Look no further. This is textbook stuff, folks. It's a classic for a reason - it's well priced, easy enough to find, and most of all it's God damn delicious.

73,226,eatabagofbooger,3.97,"I'm pretty excited about this-I've been wanting to try this one for a while. Thanks to JohnfromPurdue and thamajam for including this as an extra.  A: Pours a near opaque amber, kinda like a light colored coffee. Looks dark brown when it fills up the glass enough to block almost all light. Nice, creamy light tan head. Nothing terribly special here, but as a basic porter, there's really no need or expectation for that.  S: Holy cow, I can smell the roast from across the room. Actually smells more like roasted/toasted grain than anything else. Can an aroma be creamy? If so, this does it. Some sense of coffee roast with a bit of bitter chocolate, but mostly it smells like actual grain. Very nice.  T: Wow-there's really a lot going on here for such a little beer. None of the flavours hammer you over the head, but they sit in perfect balance. Again, nicely roasted grain, just on the edge of being burnt without crossing over, like perfectly toasted dark bread. Some hints of coffee come through, but not too much. Piny, floral, bitter hops come into play as well, and meld very well with the roasty flavours. This is a wonderful example of how a smaller beer can exhibit balance and subtlety that the bigger beers can't (just to be clear-I mostly drink bigger beers, so I'm certainly not trying to trash them here).  M: A bit thinner than most beers I drink, but that's to be expected for the style, and it works. As with the appearance, it's nothing special, but it doesn't seem like it should be. The carbonation is perfect and really brings out the bitterness from the hops in a pleasant way.

73,226,rickyleepotts,4.14,"The first time I had this beer was in Ohio. We were in town for a concert, and had some time to kill. It was actually on Thanksgiving, if I remember correctly, and there was only one bar open. We stopped in, and they had this on tap. You can’t get this beer in Indiana, so I ordered a pint. It. Was. Amazing. The concert was great too.  Let’s see if the Edmund Fitzgerald tastes like I remember.  In the Glass: It’s black. It’s a porter, and most porters are black… but this one is REALLY black. There is little head, and a thin lace. I am not a huge fan of porter, but I remember this one being a little more sweet than most.  Nose: It smells like chocolate. It has a dark sweet chocolate nose, and if I close my eyes it’s not beer I am smelling, but the holidays and all of the cookies and cakes being made in the kitchen.  Flavor: The flavor changes several times from the moment it hits your lips. There is a lot of carbonation on the front of the tongue, then it slides across the palate leading to a dry and sweet punch before you swallow to the dry and sweet finish, Remember I said it smells like chocolate… well, it has an aftertaste like that too. But I will get to that.  Mouthfeel: We drink all of our beers cold, and I bet this one gets better as it heats up. Most beers do. But this one is solid across the board. From the smell to the flavors and the aftertaste, this is a great beer. The carbonation that I get at first isn’t enough to worry me as I move my way through the glass.  Aftertaste: At first, it’s dry and sweet. Then it settles in and reminds me of a dark chocolate aftertaste. Specifically the small little Hershey’s candies… the dark ones though. Not milk chocolate. As I continue to swallow, the flavors come alive. The burp is weak, but the aftertaste lasts for a few minutes.  This is a great beer. From the moment I had it on tap, I wanted this one again. I just wish we could get this here in Indiana. If you get the chance to try this, do. You won’t regret it. Oh, and thickness that you expect from most porters… not here. It’s very thin and smooth across the palate.  Beer Name - The bottle says: - neck of the bottle - “Thanks to our craft brewing process, when you take a swig of our Edmund Fitzgerald, it will taste smoky, robust, dark and bittersweet. Thanks to our environmental efforts, if you take a swig of Lake Erie, it won’t taste smoky, dark and bittersweet.”  The bottle says: - the label - WORLD CHAMPION GOLD MEDAL WINNER World Championships Great American Beer Festival - Named after the ship that frequently docked in Cleveland and sunk in Lake Superior in 1975, our porter combines a complex, roasty aroma with a bittersweet, chocolate-coffee taste.  “In keeping with the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516, this beer is traditionally brewed from all natural ingredients: barley, hops, yeast, and water.

73,226,Blueribbon666,4.6,"Review from notes. A classic staple from Great Lakes enjoyed many times before, reviewed formally here for the 1st time. Pours a dark mahogany with a thin mocha lacing around the rim of a Blackout Stout pint glass. Smells of biscuit like malts, coffee and a bit of cocoa/dark chocolate perhaps. Taste/Mouthfeel great full flavor right up in the front, a good sipper w/o being overwhelming this sipping is for savoring as the abv is but a kiss amidst a semi-sweet malt with a nice roast coffee finish. Overall, a nice full and rich porter very well done.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,morebeergood,3.86,"Single 12 oz bottle given to me by a friend. Served into a stemmed glass. Dark brown body with a great sized tan head. Nice aroma of cocoa powder and chocolate milk. Flavor was spot on also. Dark chocolate, licorice, and just a hint of root beer were flavors that all melded well together. The mouthfeel was a bit thinner than other porters I have had recently, but conversely it made this beer even smoother to drink. Lastly, this beer had one of the smoothest finishes I have had with a porter. There was no roasted aspect left on your palate at all in the end. A very clean finish. Really great brew - I am glad I got this bottle as a souvenir from a fellow beer geek.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,dedrinker,4.3,"This is an overall porter of overallishness.  Looks just like a porter.  Smells of the roasted malts what gives an toasty roasty choco and smoky.  Love that same thing in the mouth on tasting it - but the body is lighter than a stout. This I like. You get a good roasty semi-sweet dark chocolate flavor with a little hop bite on the finish, and it stays out of the heavy zone unless you eating a big meal and trying to finish this too fast to leave the restaurant like my guy mikey does. He goes so fast always; like a hooker with his mouth!  This is just a darn good porter all around.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ToddT,4.45,"A- Dark brown, almost black, topped with a thick tan head. The head is long lasted and leaves lots of lace on the glass.  S- Roasted malt, toffee, chocolate, and a hint of hops. The aroma has a light smokey quality to it too.  T- Follows the nose closely, roasted malts, bitter sweet chocolate, slight drying note of hops, and hints of wood char are the dominate flavors. Nice counter balance of sweet toffee at the finish to keep the drying and bitter notes of the chocolate in check.  M- More than medium but not overly heavy, a fair amount of carbonation present for the style, but it is not a distraction. Not as creamy as I like in a porter, but that's not too much of a distraction or issue either.  O- Great beer, nicely balanced, complex flavors, and spot on the style. The 5.8% ABV makes this an easy drinker and sessionable to boot. If you run across this one give it a try.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,coreyfmcdonald,4.67,"12oz bottle into a snifter  A: Pours dark brown, a shade away from pitch black with two fingers of light tan head that seems to sit atop the beer forever.  S: Tons of roasted malts in this one, coffee, smoke, and roasted malts dominate this beer. I get some nuttiness and toffee in the background. As it warms, I get dark chocolate.  T: Beautiful. Roasted malts again dominate this beer, but there is a lot going on behind them. Moderate smoke, almonds, and toffee all help support the roasted malts. This beer remains dry, but the toffee flavor provides a bit of sweetness to balance. Moderate hop bitterness is also present. As the beer warms, I get some dark chocolate and caramel sweetness.  M: Medium to thick bodied with strong but creamy carbonation.  O: This porter is fantastic. The taste is complex, flavorful, and balanced. It is exactly what I want in a porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Really smooth and wonderful.  T- Many of the same notes as the smell. Wonderful chocolate and coffee along with a little caramel sweetness and a nice oakey vanilla aftertaste. Awesome taste.  M- Smooth and full bodied with a relatively low level of carbonation. Great mouthfeel.  Really wonderful porter. Nothing overly surprising, but everything is done very well. The flavors are balanced and up front. I am a big fan of this beer. I can see why it is a former GABF winner.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,littlelorib,4.03,"Date on label is 08/13/12. Poured nearly black and opaque with a finger of creamy head that stayed around for a while.

73,226,rings,4.61,"Fitz is one of Great Lakes’ year-round flagship offerings, and is among their most awarded brews. Originally developed by Dennis Holland in the early 90’s, it’s taken home hardware that would make a Vivid girl blush, all of it well-deserved, including multiple gold medals from the Great American Beer Festival and World Beer Championships. It pours thick, dark and silky, with an off-white creamy head that clings to the glass like a drowning man to a life raft. Opening malty-coffee sweet and full bodied, it’s balanced with a firm hoppy bite that compliments, rather than fights with the roasted malts. In short, it’s one of the defining American porters and should not be overlooked on any beer list. Delicious.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,tdm168,4.35,"Pours a deep, dark brownish black with a quarter of an inch of soft, creamy off white head that fades to a thin lacing. The nose has deep notes of roasted malts with some underlying notes of chocolate and coffee. The flavor is deep and roasty with chocolaty notes. There are some faint coffee notes as well and a faint hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, very smooth, and well carbonated.  This is a great porter. The flavor is balanced and it's easy to drink. I will definitely get this again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,MaximalC,3.67,"Pours a dark molasses color with a light tan head that is achievable with a moderate pour. Aroma is a blend of black coffee and bittersweet chocolate in similar measure. It tastes similar to its smell, though not quite as pleasing. The roasted coffee flavor overshadows the chocolate notes that I prefer, and both of those have a healthy dose of hops to compete with, which I find to be fairly high for a porter (though it does segway fairly seamlessly into the bitter coffee flavor). The last time I had this I thought the hop presence was way too unbalanced, though this serving has a lesser disparity than I remember. Carbonation is pretty lively for a porter, and a slightly sticky residue persists on the lips. This brew is flavorful to be sure, but it fails to take advantage of the aspects of porter that I most enjoy, leaving me ultimately a little disappointed. No disrespect intended, but I can't really justify the very high esteem in which this beer is held by many.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,MetalHopHead6,4.33,"Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is dark, delicious, and exceptionally smooth.  It poured black with a thick light brown two-finger head. It left a strong amount of thick clingy lace throughout the glass. The flavor was rich for a porter, with a strong up-front hit of bittersweet chocolate and a subtle coffee finish. The feel was light and smooth; it didn't leave much behind, but it was remarkably easy to drink.  Edmund Fitzgerald has a great blend of rich flavor and drinkability. It's smoothness makes it a year-round, even hot-summer-day chocolate/coffee beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

M - Medium to fuller bodied, very smooth and drinkable. Carbonation is pretty spot on. Slightly dry finish.  O - Edmund Fitzgerald is a top-notch American Porter.

73,226,drtth,4.36,"Served in a standard shaker pint glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: As served the beer is a dark, dark brown, almost black color with a ½ inch head that recedes slowly leaving a sheet of foam clinging to the sides of the glass. Sipping leaves lots of foam on the sides of the glass early on that eventually turns into lacing clinging to the sides. Eventually the foam recedes to a ring and an island, but even to the end of the glass there is a ring of foam and speckles of lacing.  Smell: The aroma is soft chocolate with a touch of chocolate malt, coffee and alcohol.  Taste: The flavor is rich and a wonderful mix of both bitter and sweet that is quite complex and dances around on the tongue. There is some chocolate here and some coffee flavors riding on what seems to be a caramel malt backbone.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is on the full side of medium bodied, soft and smooth with gentle carbonation throughout the beer. The finish begins with a bit of sweetness and chocolate and then gradually moves to the back of the mouth as it turns slightly bitter. Not a lot of bitterness, just enough to invite another sip. At the very end and in the throat there is a definite touch of dryness.  Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a wonderfully drinkable porter that exceeded my expectations. I’ll be having this one again and again in the future. My over all impression is that this is an extremely well made example of a porter and I find it hard to think of one I’ve had that I liked more.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Smell: Eddy smells delicious the nose is blasted with chocolate, roasted, and smoky notes. There are even slight amount of hops and dark fruit. Taste: The taste of Eddy Fitz is typical of a porter just intensified to make it a little better than most I would say. The taste is along the lines of the aroma with chocolate and roasted and smoky notes, I am getting bitterness in the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel: This beer is right where I would expect a porter to be rather easy drinking in comparison to a stout but a bit on the thicker side when next to most brown ales.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Tobacco, woodsmoke, tarragon, deep rich molasses, leather then prominent cascade pine.  Bittersweet flavors of cocoa nibs and dark roasted coffee work with big roasted, smoky flavors. Ripe plums lead into woody pine and light citrus. Solid bitterness follows.  Very smooth, light coarse carbonation.  An ideal Porter.

The head was thick, creamy looking with lots of retention and lingered for quite a while. The smell is toasted and roasted grain with a hint of coffee and chocolate. The beer tastes chocolatey and grainy up front with hints of a milky creaminess. The middle rounds out a bit with some cola like flavors and the end finishes burnt, smoky, and crisp. There is just enough hop presence in the flavor to balance everything out and provide enough bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy yet light. The carbonation is at a good lower to medium level. Okay, this is a fantastic American porter and I have never had it before. This is actually my first try and wow is it ever delicious.

Body is ruby red...less opaque than I expected. Lacing cascades down the glass from top to bottom.  S: Medium roasted malt...a little caramel. Some hops, but not much.  T: Big flavors. Smoky up front. Nicely balanced caramel and chocolate/black malts with some biscuity dryness. A touch acrid and nicely bitter during the finish.  M: Love the creaminess created by the seemingly-infinite head and medium-heavy body. Carb is fairly high for a porter and tickles the tongue.  O: My personal standard for an American Porter.

Retained a thick, 2 finger head of creamy bubbles that left a sticky coating of lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smells of roasted malts; light, acrid coffee and milk and dark chocolates.  Taste is light, yet flavorful. Light roasted notes in the front giving way to a mild sweet finish, with a touch of bitterness. A very nice balance to this beer.  The combination of light carbonation and creamy mouthfeel - almost like this beer is on nitro.  An excellent porter overall. Tastes complex and comparable to beers with double of ABV.

73,226,falloutsnow,4.11,"Bottle purchased from Binny's in Schaumburg, IL Best by 12/19/11 Poured into a standard US pint glass  Great Lakes' Edumund Fitzergald Porter is generally a pleasant, fairly complex, yet mild and friendly American porter. Not overly aggressive with aroma or taste, it still has depth of characters seen only in higher alcohol brews. Perhaps a bit of a throwback to English porters, GLBC has a solid, pleasing, and multiply drinkable beer on their hands.  Pours a large, &gt;2cm head, medium-sized bubbles, collapsing over a few minutes to a thin cap atop the beer. Leaves excellent lacing, coating the entire sides of the glass and leaving streaks and blotches with each sip. Body is dark brown to black, opaque as a whole, but sides and bottom showcase a transparent brown color. Carbonation not detectable due to darkness of beer.  Aroma of roasted malt, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, semi-bitter, acrid, but fresh, coffee, and faint vanilla (which I only noticed upon this being rather warm). Good, but not as strongly aromatic as I would have hoped (maybe a fresher bottle would be better?).  Taste opens with mild roasted malt, leading to chocolate, some malt sweetness, and continued roasted flavors in middle. Back of palate picking up moderate bitterness, continued chocolate, and faint coffee. Finishes with toasted marshmallow, slight semisweet chocolate, and pleasing bitterness.  Medium bodied, slightly watery around the edges, but with a gentle, though substantial, carbonation that almost makes this feel like a nitro-tap beer. Result is a very smooth mouthfeel and a well-flowing beer. Finish is semi-dry.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,FirstBrewsoon,4.13,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into DFH pint glass for a live review.  A - Dark as an Imperial stout, with 2 full fingers of bubbles which vary greatly in size. Recedes fairly quickly, leaving heavy lacing, which sticks around for the duration.  S - Buckets of roasted malt and cocoa nibs. Lays the foundation for a solid, robust porter.  T - Very malty and bitter, with smoke, coffee and chocolate. A long, full-fledged taste, which hangs around in its entirety for a considerable amount of time.  M - More carbonated than I would have preferred. Too light and sparkly for a beer with this deep a flavour. Takes away from the overall experience.  O - I used to live in Cleveland, where I drank this beer all the time. I don't drink this one enough anymore. A delicious brew, and at $7.99/6 pack from the local Fresh Market, you'll be hard pressed to find better value for money.

S - Vanilla, coffee, smoke, plum  T- Interesting mix of roasted vanilla/coffee beans, tinges of dark fruit, and chocolate malts. The sweetness and fullness becomes more apparent as the beer warms, this is definitely one to let stand a bit at room temp once removing it from the fridge. A faint licorice taste hides amongst the smokiness.  M- Prickly carbonation, a little on the heavy side at first. Slightly slick and more weighty as it warms, and the carbonation is balanced out.  O- Definitely on the higher end of the porter scale, a recommended beer, especially if you like smokey chocolate/coffee tastes.

M: medium body and carbed appropriately.  O: didn't stand up to the hype. Just a roasty coffee porter that definitely uses black patent or other high roast malt to give it a burnt coffee flavor.

Appearance: A semi-aggressive bottle pour got me a nice ½” creamy tan head, reducing to a thin ring after a few minutes. Quite the dark porter through and through. Bubbly thin lacing as I swirl my glass, but not clingy in nature.  Smell: Nice semi-sweet dark chocolate, coffee and burnt malts with just a hint of caramel. Aroma is much more pronounced as my beer warmed. I really like the smell of this one. Very nice…  Taste: I’ll first start by saying I haven’t really dabbled in the porters too much so I’m excited to try this one. Wow, it doesn’t disappoint. Burnt and roasty malts catch my attention right away, blending with coffee , dark chocolate, and some caramel candy sweetness in that order. A respectable mildy bitter hop presence in the finish. Not overwhelming, but a pleasant surprise.  Mouthfeel: Tingly carbonation mixes well with all of the flavors present. A slick and creamy feel to this medium body porter.  Overall: Like I said, I don’t have a lot of experience with the style but something tells me this one can be classified as the “benchmark” of porters. Outstanding in every way. I wish this came in a 1/6th keg on the east coast, as this would certainly bless my dual-tap kegerator. The 5.8 % ABV makes this pretty darn sessionable.

A bit of sweat creaminess helps to balance things out. The hops are definitely present. A little more bitter than I would prefer but still fairly balanced. I just tend to prefer more malt-forward dark ales.  M - Nice medium-full body. The carbonation is a little stinging but okay. Slight creamy/oily feel is nice.

73,226,jegross2,3.83,"Reviewing the Edmund Fitzgerald, a porter from Great Lakes Brewing Company. Score: 87  Tap pour from an unknown vintage keg (told it's from 2011) at the Brickhouse BBQ, served in a pint glass and enjoyed on 01/21/12  Appearance: Deep, dark brown body. Opaque with plenty of brown/ruby transparencies when held up to light. Served with a thin layer of creamy tan colored head. Excellent lacing. 4/5  Smell: Roasted malts, vanilla, caramel and a hint of coffee. Some notes of chocolate too. 3.5/5  Taste: Taste essentially follows the nose. Noticeable roasted malts throughout. The backbone of this beer is largely a blend of roasted caramel and chocolate malts. Some light coffee and molasses in the middle with a light nuttiness. Finish is a blend of caramel malt and vanilla cream soda, and reminds me of Surly Bender. The finish grows increasingly ""caramel sweet"" as the beer layers. Increasingly hints of roasted nuts come out on the midpalate at the beer layers too. 4/5  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, medium-light carbonation. Sweetish caramel finish 3.5/5  Overall: A very solid porter. This is a very accessible brew that is usually my ""go to"" beer at non-craft bars in the Midwest.  Recommendation: A great craft beer starter point for casual beer drinkers and very solid porter.  Pairings: Duck legs.

Somewhere in the middle there is very light hint of marshmellow sweetness and caramel/burnt sugar/molasses. Roasted malt asserts itself but then gives back a mellow burnt coffee and toast sensation. Herbal hops come back in the finish and a bite of dark chocolate puts an exclamation point.  M: Thin but strangely creamy. Plenty of fizz.  O: A very solid porter. Probably one of the best examples of a true porter I have tried. Its heavy on the burned and light on the roasty but the sweetness is just right. This one really needed to warm up to properly show off. I could have used a bit more roastiness and less on the burnt but how can I complain.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,xpdrinker,3.5,"A - Pours a glowing dark brown with thin khaki head that doesn't last, but leaves a nice lace. Surprisingly darker than their Blackout stout, though.  S - Some coffee, brown sugar and a minuscule amount of coffee. Slight touch of raisin.  T - Dark brown sugar, weak coffee, roasted almonds.  M - Light bodied, above average carbonation.  O - Only word that comes to mind is solid. Everyone should try it at least once.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

A great smoky aftertaste. Medium body and well-carbonated. Overall, a great example of the style. Subtle tastes and well-balanced. Great flavor profile for being lower gravity.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Gulpy black coffee and char flavors immediately. Nice bitter undertones from the black malts. A little spicy hop sensation, but this is a standup malty porter with lots of character. Nice semi-dry finish to balance all of the dessert-like notes in the beginning.  Medium body feels coating. Nice carbonation level. Right there with you all the way.

73,226,gueuzeonhigh,4.15,Pours a dark brown color with a short lived off-white head that recedes with a thin residual layer. There was some slight lacing of the glass.  A slight nose with hints of hops and malt.  Flavor is light-- hops comingled with toasted malt with sprites of coffee and some caramel..  Mouthfeel is cordial- as if a coverlet envelopes the palate.  Overall- a very satisfying porter-- well worth the effort to find this one.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,gtermi,4.45,"A: The beer pours a very dark brown with not much head at all. The tiny bit of head that is visible is white and sort of just floats on the top of the beer.  S: This smells very nice. It has a very strong chocolate scent with a nice bit of roasted malt. There is also a bit of coffee.  T: The first drink I take, I get a lot of chocolate and coffee, but then the more the beer lingers on my tongue you start to get a lot more malt.  M: This to me is the worst part of the beer. It is still pretty good, but a little too carbonated. it burns on the tongue and the back of the throat.  O: This beer is just amazing. The taste is just so amazing and blows me away.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,angrybabboon,4,"Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for this bottle  Review adapted from notes taken 12/31/11  Appearance: Dark brown, nearly black, pretty clear - thin tan head, fades pretty quickly but leaves some nice lacing  Smell: Burnt, charred, roasted, smoky - chocolate malts, baker's chocolate, coffee - burnt malts, but the malts smell a bit thin, weak - better as it warms up  Taste: Burnt - char, smoke - dark and bittersweet chocolate, coffee grounds, vanilla - very dry - malts are totally burnt with some caramel - some sweetness, some herbal hops - some sweetness  Mouthfeel: Light to medium, very dry, smooth  Overall: Very good, but far from legendary  I wouldn't say that this beer has a lot of hype, since it is readily available, but it does have quite a reputation. Honestly, I was a little disappointed. It's a solid porter, a great representation of the style, but there are other, widely available porters that are better.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,kevanb,4.42,"It pours a deep brown borderline black with a thin frothy caramel head. It smells of roasted coffee, smoked woods and mild chocolate. The flavors are really great, roasted coffee and smokey wood from the nose lead the way followed by bittersweet chocolate and a hint of raisins. It has a nice dry smokey mouthfeel that ends with slight acid but is generally smooth throughout.  Verdict: Great Lakes hit a homerun with this beer. It is one of the best porters that is available year round and is honestly one of the best porters in general.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,JEdmund,4.29,"This is a perfect looking porter thanks to its 3” head of tan foam; it just sits there, looking like a dollop of whipped cream. Color is pure black and only when held up to a light can you see some ruby highlights.  Nose is light, but I’m getting some cocoa powder. Maybe a just a whiff of hops.  Body is thinnish but it has a good carbonation that creates a rolling smoothness; seems right for the style.  Taste is smooth and balanced; that cocoa smell just rides this beer out from start to finish in flavor. The end seems to pack the most flavor, as some malt roast becomes evident. Bitterness also appears at end, helping create a drying finish.  This is everything I want in a porter. It’s not overly roasted or hopped, or too heavy in body. It’s a very drinkable dark beer that you can enjoy a number of and not fill up on. And definitely let it warm just a bit, as it’s even better 10 minutes or so out of the fridge.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

There's a one finger caramel colored head which settles down to a ring, sticking to the edges of the glass.  Lots of coffee is the most evident aroma, tinged with decent amounts of deep, fruity chocolate.  Bitter coffee upfront, followed by come light chocolate notes. There are some subtle hops cutting through the mix, tying the bitter and sweet together. It has a nice silky mouthfeel, a full body and a great level of carbonation.  One of the best porters I've ever had, great chocolate and coffee, it'd go great for breakfast or as dessert!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Taste begins with a black coffee astringency with some caramel sweetness. Lingering hop bitterness towards the back end. Solid porter, but awfully lukewarm in the overall flavor profile. Personally, would have liked it to have been a bit more bold.  Medium-bodied with a low carbonated presence. Easy drinking beer. Had high expectations for this, but unfortunately, this didn't quite meet them. A good, but not overly amazing porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

T- A lot of dark chocolate and burnt coffee beans. A refreshing amount of hops. Very will balanced. An Ideal tasting porter.

73,226,Goblinmunkey7,4.03,"Appearance: Deep dark brown. Nice and clear as far as it can be. Head is a nice moderate tan and clings to the glass. Settles to a super thin cap on the beer. Looks to be on point.  Smell: Cocoa dusted roasted malts. Nice grassy note in the back. Tons of chocolate, but in a nice subtle way. Bready quality to the malts as well. Nice snap of citrus hops brightens the whole thing up. Coffee as well. Lots of stuff going on here, but it's incredibly well balanced and never feels overbearing.  Taste: Caramel, coffee with cream, a nice punch of cocoa all wrapped up in something faintly bready. Hops stay present, dropping hints of citrus in the malt party. Faintly grassy/leafy hop profile works well with the whole thing. Kind of reminds me of a chocolate chocolate chip cookie if you dusted it with orange zest.  Mouthfeel: Moderate and slightly chewy. Definitely dry, almost too dry on the finish. Carbonation is solid and on point.  Overall: A very solid take on the style. Hops add a nice dimension. A touch too dry for my tastes, but other than that, it's one of the best commonly available porters I've come across.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ehammond1,3.76,"Bottle (2011)  Thanks for sharing this, NoSignsOfPain!  Black body with a initially sizable, but quickly dissipating light brown head. The beer leaves spots of lace all the way down the glass.  Initially, at its coldest temperature, this isn't the most appealing of aromas. It smells a bit of sherry and oxidation, but fortunately, that seems to mostly disappear as the beer warms. A pleasant enough, though sweet, aroma emerges. The chocolate and roast combination combines nicely at room temperatures.  The flavor is better than the aroma from start to finish. This is a sweet porter. There's quite a bit of chocolate flavor throughout, and it leans sweet as opposed to bitter. There's mild roast throughout as well, but this is more chocolatey than some chocolate stouts I've had.  Medium mouthfeel with ample carbonation.  A very nice American porter. I would very much like to try this one fresh.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,robboyd,4.1,Great beer. I blindly grabbed this bottle out of my dad's beer fridge for Thanksgiving. I wasn't expecting to review it as I didn't want to break out my computer during the holiday but it was a great tasting beer so I wanted to get it in.  It smells like roasted/smokey malt with a bit of chocolate. I also smell hops and something metallic. The taste is similar with nice roasted malt and a bit more chocolate than was on the nose. The hops are where this one shines. It's a really great accent that truly compliments the porter. It was surprising and bright. I really enjoyed it.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The color is black but you can tell its not super deep black cause there are some lighter colors coming through in the light. Bits of lacing, but not too much, head dies to just whips after a few mins then it turns into nothing.  T & M: not as powerful as I would like. Very similar in taste to a lot of the smells: smokey, roasty malts, and a bit of iron tones. Medium bodied, great (medium through low amount) carbonation. Really easy to drink.  O: Its really a solid overall, it was just a little light for my tastes if we are talking about porters.

Smell - Chocolate roast malts with a healthy dose of caramel goodness to keep it interesting. A little bit sweet smelling.  Taste - A solid background flavor of caramel that is sustained from start to finish. In the middle the roasted malts begin to build and culminate with a dark chocolate at almost lactose sweetness in the finish. Bitter at the same time. Interesting and complex.  Mouthfeel - I don't like that lactose note, because it lingers with the bitterness. Otherwise, nice body and quite drinkable. Sort of a dry finish, also.  Overall - Solid beer in every way.

Wow, this was beautiful. Poured it into a pint glass, and I saw two fingers of light tan head. The body of the beer is black, but when held up to the light, you can actually see through it, which is interesting for a porter. The lacing covers the glass, minus the random ""swiss cheese holes"".  The smell is exciting. Slight coffee equally mixed with bittersweet chocolate, a little smoky. Not the strongest scent I've smelled from a beer, but it's big and bold, yet laid back.  The taste lives up to the aroma, and then some. There's an interesting sweetness on the front, the chocolate comes through in the middle, the coffee of the back end, and then a smoky aftertaste brings up the rear.  The mouthfeel may be just a little too foamy for my liking. But maybe it helps the taste come out, so I don't really mind it.

Two fingers of creamy, buttery cappuccino-like foam dissipated to leave a spotted lacing and ring around the edge.  Smell: It smells delicious. Major notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, and coffee. It has a roasted bitterness, but it is tamed by caramel malts, molasses, and hints of dark fruit (cherry, plum, and fig).  Taste: It has a full, chewy mouthfeel like a proper porter. Roasted malts offer a nice bitterness, but it is not overwhelmingly bitter. Dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, maybe some cappuccino, and a hint of caramel.

Rich pour with a frothy head that subsides pretty quickly but leaves an intricate lace. Smells of dry spice, chocolate, and herbal/mint undertones. Taste is just great: coffee, spice, a hint of vanilla, and slight, hoppy mint. No unwanted fruitiness or sweetness. Finishes slightly dry after a spiky carbonation really opens the beer up in the mouth. Can't say enough, really. The mouthfeel is great with an effervescence not expected in this style of beer.

The body is pitch black with no highlights.  Smell- Of course there are definite coffee roast notes. Also some bitter-sweet chocolate comes through. That sweetness chugs into some deeper water with caramel and coffee creamer.  Taste- There is a great complimenting sweetness to this porter. The coffee roast is strong, and is really the back bone of the drink. Throughout though, you are presented with vanilla, caramel malt, milk chocolate, and coffee creamer. The chocolate and coffee roast last the longest into the finish.  Mouth feel- This porter is a very large medium body. And it just slides over the tongue like a loose life vest on a wet ship deck. One would expect this to finish a little dry with the heavy coffee roast, but no such thing happens.  Overall- A very impressive porter that doesn't skimp on the roasted grain, but keeps things very interesting with the semi-sweet chocolate and vanilla. These notes seem to morph every sip. This is a well made beer, and a fine tribute to the titular vessel.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,phingdong,3.98,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Very dark, almost black in appearance. Half inch light brown head with nice lacing as it goes down.  Aroma is toffee, coffee, and some bitter chocolate. The taste is more of the same but with some pronounced caramel, roasted malts, and maybe a bit of cola as well. Mouthfeel is nice . Not too thin but not heavy either. The 5.8% combined with this makes it crazy drinkable. It was gone quite quickly. This is very close to making a nice session porter.  Very tasty and drinkable porter. This is so easy to toss back multiples bottles without craving something else. It makes for a nice go to porter, especially as a chill hits the air this time of year.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The nose was roasted malt; coffee, and chocolate. The flavor is robust; malty, smoky and burnt, of chocolate and coffee, the mouth feel is smooth and creamy with a light bittersweet finish.

Creamy lacing coats the side of the glass. Impenetrable deep brown colour.  Smell is burnt malt, coffee, bitter hops, dark fruit.  Taste is coffee with a significant dark chocolate taste and bitterness, smokey, earthy hops, burnt malt and some sweet dark rye bread.  Light to medium body with ample carbonation. Plenty of bitter coffee.  Overall an excellent porter I will look to grab again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Rich and creamy head (looks a lot like rootbeer foam) off white in color and sticks around for a good long time Smells of roasted malts, raisins, and sweet bread. Every time I smelled this I couldn't help but think of fresh baked muffins I pick up a little hop flavor followed by dark fruit and bready sweetness Medium bodied, I can feel the carbonation and it coats the mouth. Hops are followed by the sweet malts which leads to a crisp hop finish, a lot going on here This is a very fine beverage, a real bargain and readily available in my area",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,nataku00,4.22,"Bottle poured into a tulip glass. Beer pours an opaque murky dark brown with some lighter browns at the edge of the glass when held up to a light. Initial half a finger of loose soapy khaki colored head dissipates quickly, leaving a few patches of light lacing, to a thin collar of small bubbles and a thin film along the surface. Some fine carbonation visible at the edge of the glass.  Nose is a dark roasted malts, fresh roasted coffee and dark caramel, with a small amount of milk chocolate sweetness. Very deep roast, with a hint of smokiness as well.  Taking a sip, big roasted and smoked malts, bitter coffee right away. Then it mellows quickly to a sweeter milk chocolate and lactic tang, and darker bread flavors. Finish is dry with a bit of lactic tang and light residual dark roast bitterness.  Light body with a lot of carbonation, prickly on the tongue. Pretty easy to drink with a smooth roasty flavor without too strong a lingering aftertaste.

73,226,Scotchboy,4.13,"My second experience with this grand Porter, going to give a proper review this go-around. This bottle courtesy of Aaron, gracias! Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint.  A: Pours thin but dark with lots of ruby red showing through the edges of this glass...a large somewhat soapy khaki colored head with small and medium bubbles leaves decent lace.  S: Smells chocolatey right off the bat; roasted and caramel malts, bakers chocolate, earthy sweetness, followed by some coffee notes. Light earthy hops...woody as well?  T & MF: Dark and roasty but there is a good amount of caramel as well; peanut butter, chocolate, light coffee flavors and bitterness, earthy hops...refreshing wet body, light-to-medium mouthfeel, finishes with bitter chocolate & coffee and dries out your palette.  O: This is a really good Porter, glad I've still got another couple bottles from another trade. This is right up there with Black Butte in my opinion, just a roasty, chocolatey, drinkable porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,tigg924,4,"Appearance: 1/3 inch head, dark chestnut brown in color, clear  Smell: deep roasted malt and coffee  Taste: a nice combination of roasted malt and coffee—which provides a touch of bitterness. I detect a slight bit of caramel on the end. Nice and complex  Mouthfeel: moderate carbonation and body, sweet with bitterness in the back and a slightly sweeter end.  Overall: From my limited tasting of six Great Lakes beers this is my favorite—It may be my favorite from Ohio. This is a very, very nice rich and complex porter. I am certainly glad I got a six pack and am looking forward to the rest of them. This would be a fridge staple if it were distributed locally. I think this one may be a small step below Firestone Walker’s reserve in my overall porter list.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,NuclearDolphin,4.3,"Served in a 16oz Tulip Glass  Appearence - Almost pitch black color with a Dark Brown/Crimson hue when held up to light. Pours a nice head that is surprisingly brown that stays for a while  Smell - There is a very strong scent of both Chocolate and Caramel and roasted malts upon first impression. There is also a subtle scent of coffee to go along with it.  Taste - The chocolate flavor hits you almost immediately and roasted malts are MUCH more prevalent and up front then when tasted. It finishes with a coffee bitterness and chocolate taste. For me, it left a great after taste of chocolate and burnt malts  Mouthfeel - It manages to have both a lighter feeling AND a not-so-thin feel to it. There is more carbonation than I expected there would be, but it's very easy to overlook  Overall - Truly an outstanding beer! I was not a fan of Porters at all, but after trying out this beer when a co-worker recommended it to me, I can say that I'm very willing to try more Porters in the future. Another great beer by Great Lakes Brewing!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,CheezyBlaster,4.45,"Nose is all burnt/roasted malts, dry roasted coffee beans. Burnt popcorn, but in an awesome way! Wow!  Tastes like burnt barely, dark roast coffee grounds with the oils removed, a bit of cocoa powder, some light hops, and a dash of cream. Sounds gross right? It's not. This is all combined with a pinch of fantastic, believe it!  This is the best porter I've ever had.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Dense, but puffy tan head that sticks around very nicely, and a nice lacing down the glass. I don't think a porter could appear nicer.  S-heavily roasted caramel malts, with hints of chocolate and coffee  T-follows the smell to a tee. I could use just a bit more aggressiveness in the taste, but it's quite good. Floral hops provide a counterpoint, but don't impede on the malt bill. It has the distinct finishing flavor that most great lakes brews have, and a touch of herbal hops.  M- a bit more carbonation that most porters, medium, but dense mouthfeel. Finishes dry.  O- Very good, I appreciate that the hops don't overpower the malt bill. Certainly one of the better American Porters I've had.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,woosterbill,4.35,"12oz bottle with about six months on it into a Duvel tulip.  A: A steady pour results in a finger of fine tan foam on top of a black body that glows a clear brown around the edges when held up to light. The moderate-sized head sticks around nicely and leaves tons of solid lace. Excellent.  S: Luscious, rich, decadent aroma of dark chocolate and roasted coffee. That's it. It's simple, direct, and lovely.  T: More complex than the aroma, but not quite as intense. The coffee and chocolate are still dominant, but are joined by a bit of dark fruit up front, some licorice midway through, and a fair dose of roasty and hoppy bitterness on the long finish. The bitterness flirts with astringency, but happily turns into a pleasant smokiness on the aftertaste. Delicious.  M: Surprisingly light body with lots of carbonation. I'd like a bit more heft and creaminess, but I suppose that would make it a stout. It tastes incredibly good for a 5.8% porter, but feels exactly how you'd expect. Pretty average.  O: Terrific beer. I've taken entirely too long getting around to trying this deservedly famed brew. It lives up to its sterling reputation entirely, and is definitely a strong contender for best in its style. I'd love to try it side by side with Founders Porter and Deschutes Black Butte.  Cheers!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Mouthfeel: medium body.. finishes dry.  Overall: Easily one of the best porters I've ever had.. How is this the only Great Lakes beer I've had to date? I need to fix that..

Super-dark brown, though some light makes it through. Insane head retention. Good lacing.  S: Rich roasted malts. Sweet vanilla and tartish fruit (berries? No...hm).  T: Good, but not as good as I expected from the ratings, appearance, and smell. The aftertaste is the best bit -- long, bitter/chalky, cacao, and coffee. By contrast, the maintaste is surprisingly weak with a subdued maltiness and boring milk chocolate. The sweetness is, at times, almost grainily malty.  M: Very smooth. Lightly chocolatey. Nice.  O: Good beer; nice porter. Still, not as astoundingly good as, say, the Dortmunder Gold. Recommended, but not anything to seek out.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The head starts dense and decomes chunks as it slowely recedes. Lacing sticks everywhere.  Smell: All malts sweet, smokey, and roasty! Smells damn fine!  Taste: Mild malty sweetness that blend nicely with a mild smoke and earthy peat note. Finishes with a nice mild roasty kick. The roasty note just kind of lingers forever, but never gets boring. This is what a good porter should taste like! YUM!  Mouthfeel: Very drinkable porter here. Light end of a medium bodied beer and moderate carbonation. I bit thiner than I like my porters and not that creamy either. It its still well made porter.  Overall: This beer is a thinner version of Deschutes Black Butte. I really love this beer, but I want a dark beer to be a litte bit heavier. It does have a nice complexity to it as well.

Appearance: Pours a dark rich mahogany with a finger thick tan head that shrinks to a thin lacing over the top.  Aroma: Big burst of coffee, roasted grains, chocolate and earthy hops that add a little bit of spice.  Taste: The roasty and coffee characteristics are the dominate flavors with chocolate taking a back seat.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium-high carbonation and a dry roasty finish.  Overall: I had heard lots of good things about this beer and yes it was good. Sadly I was slightly disappointed due to the hype built up around this beer.

73,226,ahq514,4.1,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into shaker pint glass.  Pours a wonderful deep brown with a thick, solid head that diminishes to a thick film atop the beer. Appears to have light carbonation. As far as lacing goes, almost the whole glass has lace minus the part I've been drinking from - awesome lacing.  Get big whiffs of coffee and roasted malt right off the bat. This is complemented by a little bit of chocolate roasted malt and some real subtle earthy hops. Smells like a standard porter, but the aromas come out very nicely instead of being subdued.  Starts out with a slightly bitter hop bite. This nicely transitions into a nice coffee profile (with a slight hint of chocolate) which emphasizes dry and roasty characteristics. The beer continues to dry out and finishes that way - dry and roasty. Not overly complex or simple.  Maybe I had one beer that ruined it for me, but most of the porters and stouts I've had recently have seemed a bit thin in profile or not as heavy in body as I would like. This one seems a bit thin as well. It seems to have a nice medium body to it. Nice on carbonation, a bit on the low side.  Overall, this is one of the better porters out there, especially if you like coffee. Aside from the thinness (which I might be making up), this beer is awesome. Could see this as one of my staple porters.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

I bought this one (also a 3 Floyds Dreadnaught and an Ossian English Mild Pale Ale that put me at 100 beer styles tried) from West Lake View liquors in Illinois.  This is an outstanding Porter. Poured into a pint glass after letting it warm up a bit. Dense brown color, a little light gets through at the bottom of the glass. Medium size light tan head with good retention. Rings of lacing all around the glass. A good looking beer!!  Smell is outstanding. Robust aroma of roasted malts and milk chocolate.  Taste matches aroma.

This is a porter with a lingering, tan, foamy head and an overall color as dark as the depths of Lake Superior. Smells of hops with an almost wine like undertone Taste is bold up front with an almost tannin like tang. It’s almost as if the alcohol can be tasted, perhaps more so than the listed 5.8% ABV would lead you to believe. This fades into a slightly bitter hoppy finish. I generally like the flavor profile but feel there is something missing in the mouth feel department. Seems a little light on the roasted malt flavor. Speaking of light, it’s hard to get that frikkin’ maudlin Gordon Lightfoot song out of my head ever since I looked at the label. While a six minute earworm may not be a big deal to you, that can register as well over a half hour in dog minutes.

73,226,axeman9182,4.11,"12oz bottle with a best by date of 11/30/10, thanks to sobeleg. This one was allowed to warm a few minutes before being poured into my Brooklyn Brewery tulip.  Edmund Fitzgerald pours not quite stout black, with just a sliver of cherry highlights peeking through from the bottom of the glass. The foam that caps the beer is light tan in color, and falls just short of two fingers in height. Head retenetion is well above average, and the beer leaves a fairly good sized ring of suds stuck to the inside of the glass. The nose is a bit weak, and almost reminds me of a milk stout. It's very heavy on milk chocolate, with only a cursory appearance from a coffee aroma. Fortunately, the smell didn't begin to do Edmund Fitz justice. The flavor palate, is all chocolate and coffee, but it's... just about perfect. A not overly sweet chocolate flavor takes the lead on each sip, before a slightly bitter, perfectly roasty note of coffee comes in to close things out. The two couldn't be any better balanced. The body is pleasantly full and chewy for a beer that falls short of 6%ABV, with a low-moderate level of carbonation that fits the beer like a glove. I'd heard a lot of people call Edmund Fitzgerald the best/one of the best American Porters out there, and after having my first I totally get that.

Smells of roasted malt; faintly chocolatey.  Flavor is somewhat bitter, full of chocolate malt. Feels like the bitterness outshines the other flavors a little too much. Surprisingly high carbonation, lively mouthfeel, thin and spritzy. A bit too bubbly and not creamy enough for my taste. Fairly dry and short on the finish; the bitterness fades quickly.

S – Mild sweetness, some coffee, a good roasted malt as well.  T – Very balanced, a good dark rich roasted malt flavor comes first, add a decent bitterness. There is a little coffee and chocolate that dances on the tongue. Great malt profile from beginning to end, but there seems to be a good mix of dark roast and sweet malt.

Background consists of chocolate and coffee overtones. Very pleasant and pleasing smell to the nostrils.  T: Smooth, dark, rich ale with a roasted malt bitterness.

The flavor is even more roasty, brimming with bitter espresso beans paired with a slightly sweet chocolate aspect. Earthy and complex but with lighter, citric brightness coming through as well.

The taste is caramel malt, light roasted peat, tart fruit, sweetened chocolate, milder coffee, leafy hops, and, um, well, the kitchen sink.

It is a refreshing porter, but it did not provide enough smoothness to compliment the rich flavors.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,haywire77,4.01,"Brew poured a very nice mahogany brown with only a hint of light coming through the glass. 2"" of serious khaki colored head on top that faded fairly quickly to reveal a light brown cap that stared up at me with a few large, sporadic eye-like bubbles.  Smell is mostly sweet malts and a hint of bitter, dark chocolate. Smoke, toffee, and coffee kind of struggle to come through, but they are there.  The taste is very unique for a porter, in my opinion. Not all coffee and such, but the bitter chocolate is there and a touch of tartness. Mostly roasted malts and just a touch of dark roast coffee. Not overpowering, not very sweet or bitter, but balanced.  Mouthfeel is a little boring. Very thin and no sticky chocolaty goodness. Just a roasted smoke feeling, if there is such a thing.  Overall this is a solid porter that I keep going back to over and over. Very much available in my area, and a fridge staple. Low ABV makes it great to have several on those cool fall PA evenings while sitting around the fire telling stories, or eating smores.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Amazing lacing.  S: Lots of roasted malt and some nice chocolate. A hint of coffee.  T: Same as the nose. Just a tiny bit bitter up front with some nice roasted malt, then the coffee and the dark chocolate sorta follows it through to a nice smooth creamy finish.  M: Very smooth and creamy but not too big like a stout. Proper porter-like.  O: A great porter. Some porters are borderline stouts but this one draws the line nicely. Not too heavy but still has all the great porter aspects. Not really smoky either like some porters which makes me happy.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Morey,4,"12 oz bottle with ""Best if enjoyed by 12/13/2011"" stamped on the side of the label.  Pours black in color, but you can certainly see some ruby red and dark brown if you hold it up to the light. Tan colored head stood approx. one finger tall following a medium-aggressive pour. Has settled to a thin layer after about 5 minutes or so. Good head retention with some lacing left behind.  Roasty aroma with bittersweet chocolate notes and iced coffee in the nose.  A touch of hop bitterness up front followed by a rounded flavor featuring roasted malt, a kiss of tobacco, and coffee with a smooth flavorful finish.  Medium bodied with moderate-low carbonation level.  An above average Porter from an above average brewery.  Morey's Bottom Line: I love Great Lakes, and I love Cleveland. That being said, I don't personally feel that this beer is the ""be all, end all"" within the style. It's really good, but I prefer Founders Porter even if this one is more true to style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Tastes very similiar to how it smells. Bitterness comes through on the end at the back of the tongue.  M: Creamy and smooth.

A very big light mocha head forms before residing to a good capping. Good filmy lacing.  S- Chocolate and coffee upfront. Pretty good aroma. Could be stronger and have more depth.  T- Bittersweet chocolate all over the palate. There is some bitter zest. A very light smoke on the back end. Good.  M- Starts medium bodied then thins out. Stays wet through entire taste and finish.

73,226,jmarsh123,4.3,"Pours a dark brown with a generous tan head that subsides, but sticks around throughout the glass.  Smells of chocolate and lots of roasted malt. A little earthiness too from the hops.  Strong chocolate/roasted malts flavor with just a touch of spiciness. Heavy bitterness from the chocolate, but not overpowering as in some other porters.  Pretty thick although not syrupy at all. Good carbonation level for style. It's there, but not too much.

Black, with some red tints when held up to light. Great retention, head has still not gone after 5 minutes. Lacing is fair, but to be honest glass has been used for a few.  Smell is strong bitter chocolate with hints of coffee. Wonderful smell.  Taste is more of the same, bitter chocolate, touches of coffee and some herbal hops to balance. Very good.  Feel is good, not incredible carbonation so head is manageable. Enough CO2 stays around to leave tasty bubbles on the tongue which taste like bitter chocolate and hope. Mmmm.

The flavor combinations of roasted coffee and chocolate remind one of a mocha without the overly sweet sense that many mochas have.

This doesn't fall into either of those categories and it seems to be in its own category.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BoozySmurf,4.42,"Pours dark and opaque. Strong roasted character in the nose, like coffee and dark chocolate.

Cheers.  Auburn with a slight head that fades into nothingness with no lacing. After 10 minutes in the glass, it actually looks kind've sad and lonesome. Aroma of chocolate and iron. The chocolate is wonderful, the iron not too bad. Sort've one dimensional, though. The taste is similar, a rich chocolate flavor in a well-attenuated beer that doesn't have much body. I guess my preference is much more towards porters with more full flavor. A little black malt for some coffee-like presence. I know it's a brown porter, but it's still coming way short for me.

T-The flavor notes are much the same as above mentioned, but of coarse with a very clean bitterness to boot. And a bittersweet coffee and chocolate finish lasts forever on the palate.  M-The mouthfeel actually is a little dissapointing to me. It's kind of watery feeling that I can't get over... And it's knid of oxidized too.

73,226,WastingFreetime,4.4,"Not quite pitch black, but almost. One finger of sturdy tan head, extra foamy in texture. No lacing left behind, however. Medium thick yet creamy in texture, no complaints about the body. Smells of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. To further elaborate, it smells of really *well* roasted coffee that hasn't been pushed all the way to burnt black, and really *good* dark baking chocolate. Taste follows the nose, but also includes a hopping note that comes across as almost a sort of light psuedo-woody and bark tone accent. Which actually fits quite well in line with everything else.

Creamy with a nice light carbonation touch.  O: Just awesome. For a porter this is hands down the best I've ever had. So completely drinkable and delicious.

Tons of roasted malts, everything that you should smell in a very good porter comes out in this one. Chocolate, coffee, slight hop presence, it just a very nice smelling brew.  Taste: Hands down amazing. Everything you get in the nose come through and just melds to a beautiful tasting beer.  Mouth: Medium bodied. Very pleasing.

73,226,Roke87,4.62,"12oz. bottle slightly chilled and poured into a Duvel tulip Best before: 10/01/11  Appearance- Pours a dark black, but then turns into brown lining once held up to a light. Average pour yields about a finger and a half of fluffy tan coloured head that somewhat quickly dissipates to a tiny bubbly top and a nice mocha ring around the glass, leaving minimal to no lacing throughout till finish.  Smell- Nothing really out of the ordinary for this porter, you get that usual roasted malt, coffee, and dark chocolate aroma in there right away with a sweet caramel smell coming through as well. The nose was enjoyable, well balanced and a nice strong aroma.  Taste- Very similar to the smells and a very well balanced and complex porter, I am getting a bitter coffee taste right off the bat, with the bakers’ chocolate/powder cocoa coming through next, and finishes with a nice roasted malt and sweet caramel mix, very enjoyable.  Mouthfeel- Definitely not a light bodied porter, personally I would say it is more on the medium end of the scale, not thick at all but it has a nice creamy porter feel to it, with a mild carbonation as well.  Overall- I really liked this porter to be honest, I didn’t know what to really expect with such a high rating here on BA and the somewhat hype surrounding it, but I was pleasantly surprised. I think it really deserves its rating as it has a nice creamy medium mouth feel to it where other porters I have tried are much more watery. The aromas and tastes are spot on for a porter, the latter being very well balanced. Overall a very enjoyable porter and I will be searching this one out again, maybe pick up a six other than just a single bottle this time.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,VncentLIFE,4.72,"Pours black with very light brown hues. Head poured a half inch that instantly dissipated to a thin ring. Only knock for this beer.  Dark coffee hits the nose instantly, but the bitterness is offset by dark chocolate. Roasty malt intertwines nicely. Very complex in the nose.  It tastes as complex as it smells. Roasty malt mixes with a coffee taste. Body is exactly wht I'd epxect for a porter. Light but with enough malt flavors and dark chocolate/coffee to give it a bit of complexity. The chocolate is more prevalent in the nose than in the mouth.  The dark malt sticks with you to leave somewhat of a bitterness on the tongue. The flavor that stays is excellent.

73,226,auroracrisis,4.2,"12oz into a pint glass. Best before 12/19/2012  Dark, dark brown; almost black with a tiny head that lingers. A tiny bit of lacing.  On the nose, you are greeted by chalky roasted malts with notes of coffee, caramel, and toffee. Subtle hints of bakers chocolate and earthy hops, as well as some licorice.  The taste is dark malts with an espresso and toffee or caramel profile. A little bit chalky as well. Again, bakers chocolate and a hint of hops, but these flavors are much more apparent than the similar scents on the nose of the beer. Finishes with a rich caramel flavor similar to a Werther's Original  Light-medium in body with a creamy texture, and just a touch of carbonation. Kind of light in the body for a porter. Also a touch of drying.  Overall, a good American porter. Solid roasted coffee and sweet malt flavors, but lacking a little in the aroma. A great porter for the price though. A real bargain.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Mosley1212,4.42,"Taken from my tasting notes from last night. Last beer provided by JohnB87, thanks again! Poured into a pint glass.  A--Deep dark brown with a tan, fluffy 1"" head that took a while to dissipated. A little bit of lacing down the side as the beer was enjoyed.  S--Roasted malt, bitter chocolate, cocoa, caramel, butterscotch, and toffee. Finished with just the slightest hint of a dark roast coffee (possible espresso). This had quite a bit of a nose on it. It grew more powerful as the beer warmed up, blossoming into a complex porter.  T--Nicely follows the nose--rich toffee and a slight coffee backbone. The chocolate and caramel mix well, but also clash perfectly with the bitter coffee.  M--Light-bodied and a little watery. It isn't one of the heavier porters on the market. A fact that is apparent on the first sip.  O--I'm not usually a porter guy, but this is one that I could really enjoy on a cold night...not that we get many of those in Miami.

73,226,Auracom,4.12,"Quite possibly the easiest beer to review. Ever. I've had it on-tap and in bottles, but for the particular review I went with a 12 oz'er into a pint glass at Poor Phil's.  Extreme dark brown with generally mellow visuals. Good head, rejoice and move onward! The nose is divided like Two Face on a night out in Gotham. Coffee and roasted notes. Arguably chocolate, but this isn't a stout, it's a mortherfucking porter. And motherfucking porters are best at doing things simple. So for the sake of this review, we're sticking with two aromas. Ditto on the taste, but I concede to more of a dark chocolate element as well.  Textbook porter mouthfeel - medium body, smooth, creamy, light finish. Beer professors would be satisfied with this, if only they existed. That would seriously be the best job ever.  Drinkability is king with Eddie Fitz.

73,226,JohnnyBarman,4.38,"Single bottle from my Great Lakes Sampler Pack.  Poured in to a Duvel chalice. Lovely pitch black brew, slight chestnut when held to the light. My aggressive little pour created about an inch and a half of coffee foam-coloured head, which descended slowly into a thick ring with some patches of lace. Brilliant looking porter.  Nose is rich coffee, chocolate, marshmallow, toasted bread, biscuit. Very pleasant.  After a string of various brews whose nose proved far more complex than their taste, Great Lakes is completely the opposite. Dark, roasty, and complex - everything I like in a porter. Subtle notes of peat and leather occasionally break through. Dry coffee finish.  Mild, but zippy carbonation, slick mouthfeel coats the tongue well, thin bodied and creamy.  Textbook porter - rich, hearty, flavorful, yet thin and smooth enough for easy drinking. Totally worth seeking out.

73,226,firkinhophead,4.22,"A hard pour into my Old Rasputin nonic yields a full 2 fingers of fat, crackling bubbles that quickly settle into a rocky finger of various sized bubbles. Color is deep brown with garnet highlights. Looks clear but mostly too dark to see through.  Aroma is full of roasted malts, coffee, and cocoa in about equal measure. Just a hint of burnt sugar and caramel in the background. Can't wait to taste this.  Roasted malts are right up from, but no acridity or ash. Nutty dryness, bread crust, rye, and pumpernickel highlight the malt flavors. Some herbal bite that may come from hops, but probably just some anise notes from the malt. Solid bitterness locks in with the roasted flavors to soak up any hint of sweetness.Wouldn't mind a bit more yeasty sourness and residual sugar. But it is an American porter.  Plenty lively in the mouth and dead perfect body. If you want it thicker than this, go with a different style.  Fantastic American porter, probably the best, though I haven't tried them all, obviously. Went great with some mild bleu Kentucky Rose cheese from Kenny's Farmhouse Cheese (Austin, KY), which provided the requisite funk and creaminess.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Per usual, the appearance in my glass was impressive as I like the look of a porter. It had a brownish head over top a dark coffee color of the beer.  The taste was mostly of bittersweet chocolate, coffee and a little bit of dried fruit. It was certainly a little more bitter than a lot of the stouts I like but thats okay because this is a porter and I expect it to be different.  It would be nice if the alcohol content was a little higher but if nothing else, it keeps the cost down and makes this an affordable six pack that I think I will buy again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

It finishes with a dry hoppy taste on the palate  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer, very carbonated and thick feeling on the palate.  Overall: Very good porter, a little too much for my taste but still another classic product from GLBC",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Gtreid,4.2,"12 oz. bottle poured into a standard pint glass.  A: Deep mahogany color. The pour dropped a two finger, light tan head, that retained extremely well and left tons of lace.  A: Complex aroma of both bittersweet and dark chocolate with notes of roast, small coffee, and caramel. A small hop presence shows its face as an earthy/dirty manner.  T: Follows the nose well. Notes of chocolate, coffee, dirt, and caramel. It's pretty bitter, probably from the combination of bittersweet chocolate and hops. Finishes dry and sweet with no hint of ABV.  M: Medium body, aggressive carbonation. I guess it's a bit light for my tastes here, but not all that bad.  O: Really enjoyable porter. Pretty complex flavor profile from a beer ringing in at 5.8%. Don't know if it's the best I've had, but it's right up near the top. Skal.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,DabblinWiscCraft,4.27,"Pours a deep, roasted coffee bean brown--a reddish amber at the edges where the light strikes through, making it look a lot like a cola. Had a healthy 1/2 inch taupe head that fell to a thin lace but stuck around and had some cling. Nice roasted caramel malts are prominent in the nose, with coffee and chocolate notes mingling nicely. There's also a pleasing nuttiness to the bouquet. Dark caramel malt flavor abounds at first taste, with coffee the most pronounced flavor note. There's also some good smokiness and nuttiness that follows, all very smooth and quite creamy. A bit of hop zest hits the tongue near the finish, but the malts persist the longest on the palate. This is a medium-bodied brew, quite effervescent and creamy--it maintains its smoothness without being overtly syrupy. Fairly clean-finishing.  This is a very enjoyable porter that has a very nice malt profile, good smoothness, and very solid balance. Edmund Fitzgerald does what a good porter should do on every front, and the coffee-leaning taste profile is a special treat for a coffee appreciator like me. Well worth the purchase.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S- burnt coffee, some dark choclate notes, roasty malts, some oaky smoke  T- just like the smell, and it goes down really smooth despite its full body and bitter finish.  O- It seems like everytime I have a Great Lakes brew I am blown away, and this certianly follows that train of thought.

A - deep dark chocolate in the nose, fresh bold coffee beans, cooked aroma. oh how i wish this had some vanilla bean in it. very good aroma that is full throughout.  T - very strong roasted malt, burnt chocolate, espresso with a big intensity that lingers with some hops spriknled throughout the finish, no alcohol presence.  M - its a bit thin for my liking but not necessarily the style, the carbonation is present a gives a slight tingle on the back of the throat.  O - I am very appreciative of this beer i received in a trade and glad i have four but will most likely not seek this one out for the future, im not the biggest fan of the style unless they are much bigger. i really wanted to see what all the fuss was about, can't elaborate, get over it, loss of words.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,eat,4.3,"Pours a sparse cream-white head with a ring around the glass and some lacing. Opaque black body with root-beer edges.  The nose is of light molasses, nice minerals, roast malt, salted caramel, a little grain. Dark, powdery chocolate and a hint of smoke come out more as it warms. Quite malty and sweet.  This is one of those rare beers in which the flavours follow perfectly in sequence: up front is a lightly-incorperated though highly-roasted malt, bordering on smoky and presenting as a hint of dark-roast coffee. A distinctive mineral profile follows, which seems to be integral to all the best porters I've tried and definitely shines with this example. It then opens up into nearly perfectly balanced lightly-sweet caramel and dark soily hops, which themselves transition into a drying dark-chocolate finish, hanging on until the next sip.  Light-medium body and fairly low carbonation seem to fit this one well.  I'm not certain this is the best porter I've ever tried but it's definitely right up there with any of the others (top three for sure). The light body keeps it going down easy and the drying finish keeps you sipping. Well-balanced and flavourful; you can't expect much more out of a porter. This is the kind of beer I wish could always be in my fridge.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Creamy, flavorful maltiness...chocolate and coffee bitterness, sweet in the middle, integrating a flash of citrus before finishing with some black malt dryness. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated.  Not quite as amazing as I'd hoped, but a very nice porter overall. Smooth all around.  Edit: Bumping the score up a bit after my second encounter with this beer. More smokey char and a really nice, balanced flavor.

To be honest, I often times over look most of their offerings in lieu of more exotic brewers. Exotic does not always mean better. Recently I've been on a porter binge so to speak and Edmund Fitzgerald has been consumed the most. I have partaken in it's libational eloquence via bottle and tap. It is after all, a fantastic beer.  A - Black as thick midnight hanging over a field, with subtle touches of chocoalte milk. Small white head appears after pouring and fades slightly, only to be restored after each sip. Lacing levels out nicely in turn.  S - Pungent of bittersweet chocolate with a bite of quite possibly anise? Roasted chocolate and toffee malt and a faint coffee reserve linger in the background.  T - The taste mirrors the aroma very nicely, swirling bittersweet chocolate and coffee in addition to roasted matlyness only as a complex and resoundingly simple stated porter should. Edmund Fitz finishes with truly rich chocolate that lingers satisfyingly.  M - Amazing. Enough said.  O - While the beer is named after a ship that sunk in Lake Superior, this porter will never bottom out in my opinion.

S - The aroma is strongly of roasted coffee, loads of sweet milk chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. Very nice aroma!  T - The flavor is more of the same. Initially, it's all chocolate with hints of bitter coffee laced throughout. As the flavor develops, a caramel shows up bringing with it a wonderful hint of vanilla and dark fruit.

Great smoky aroma. One of the best smelling porters around. The taste is exceptional and follows the aroma. Coffee up-front then the chocolate malt tames it a bit with some sweet from the malt to balance out. At the finish some good bitterness. Full body with good carb levels and pleasing aftertaste.  Overall, an outstanding porter that really hits the spot even on this very hot Texas evening. Highly recommend and worthy of the hype.

73,226,Jeffo,2.88,"Mom and Dad brought this one back from their last trip to the States. Thanks guys.  APPEARANCE: Very clear brown out of the bottle. Pour yields a one finger, medium-thinner looking tan head with decent retention. Very noisy as well. Dark brown body with medium levels of carbonation. A ring remains and leaves some dots of lacing down the glass. Average at best for the style.  SMELL: Mild nose. Some dark malts, roasted malts, and touches of coffee. Not much going on really.  TASTE: Dark malts, caramel malts, and touches of coffee in there. A bit of bitter-sweetness after the swallow. Mild yet lingering aftertaste shows some caramel and dark malt sweetness, with touches of bitter coffee as balance. Okay, but way too mild to be memorable.  PALATE: Medium-light body and medium carbonation. Lighter on the palate than normal. Creamy smooth on the palate, which is nice, goes down smooth and finishes rather dry.  OVERALL: Average at best for the style. Not sure why this one gets all the great press. The bottle is within the best-before date, but perhaps this one has faded faster than the bottle dating machine thought it would.

73,226,augustgarage,4.47,"Thanks to northyorksammy for this long time want. Best before July 19th, 2011. Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass.  Seal brow liquid, nearly opaque with faint auburn highlights and a finger of buff foam that recedes to a ropey collar and a lasting surface slick. Good retention. Old world lacing. No legs.  Deep rich roast aromatics suggest coffee, cocoa nibs, brown sugar, toasted oats, and speciality malt.  Rather tart palate entry, owing to the astringency from the roast I suppose, which while never acrid, has a distinctive potency. The aromas become the flavors with increasing intensity and a slow spread of mellowing dryness into the roasty/malty/nutty finish. Mild bitterness with a whisper of hop flavor throughout as well.  Medium-bodied, well carbonated, velvety, yet crisp.  A very satisfying example of the style - quite different from my other favorites of the style, this is certainly their peer. A shame it isn't readily available out here.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,SWMeyer4141,4.43,"My 100th review  Appearance-Body is a light black, Very dark purple. Head is outstanding, 2 finger creamy brown head with some big bubbles and excellent retention. Haven't taken my first sip yet, it's been 5 minutes and theres still a nice 1/2 finger head with nice lacing.  Aroma-Very roasty. Dark, slightly bitter chocolate. Some dark fruits as well.  Taste-Initial taste was roasted malts, followed by some dark chocolate and sweet dark fruits. Slightly bitter towards the finish. As the beer warms a bit it opens up even more. More chocolate, more roastiness and some slight vanilla. Cleanest finish.  Mouthfeel-Light to medium bodied, goes down very smooth. Moderate carbonation. Clean finish. Rediculously drinkable.  Overall-I have a bad track record with Porters. I don't like them for some reason, I consider them watered down stouts. I've been drinking this beer for not too long and i'm starting at the 1/3 full glass. Beautiful lacing left, and just delightful. This is a world class beer. So easy to drink, tasty and refreshing.

73,226,matttttYCE,4.17,"12oz bottle with an enjoy by date of 9/12/11 poured into my Deschutes snifter. Heard good things about this, excited for the review. Thanks Andrew for another very nice extra!  Appearance - Somewhat aggressive pour gives off a nice 1 1/2 finger head with a nice light tan color and some smaller creamier looking bubbles. Color is almost black but you can see some dark brown and deep dark ruby hues when held up to the light. Looks quite nice and leaves a bit of lace.  Smell - I'm getting mostly those typical porter aromas of roasted malts, coffee, and some chocolate with hints of smoke and vanilla but it seems one of the nicer porters I've smelled. Indeed intriguing and leaves me smelling again and again. I don't get much hops in the nose.  Taste - Taste is pretty much like the smell but I'm getting some caramel and dark fruit along with the roasted barley and coffee notes with what seems like that characteristic dryer taste of a porter. Maybe some hops in there, but I couldn't tell you which hop flavors exactly. They're more there to just balance this one out. Also getting that sort of classic porter bite or bitter aspect and finish, but it's not like a lot of other porters. It's more balanced/not strong and I don't know, just something great balanced and drinkable about this porter is about the only other thing I can say.  Mouthfeel - At first sip I had to go right to the mouthfeel because this is pretty thin. Not extremely so, but seems thinner than most porters around the same ABV that I can remember. I don't think the thin feel detracts from this brew, though. If anything it adds to the drinkability. It's got a medium level of carbonation (which helps this to not be too light) and a medium body. Finish is dryer but sweet and a bit biting like I said, but very nice. Lingers for a while to remind you to take another sip, but fades mostly before you can put your mouth to the glass again.  Overall - I'd say this is a very solid Porter overall. Actually one of my favorite of those I've tried so far, especially in that it's very drinkable and not overbearing, with just enough flavor and porter-ness to woo you. I could actually see myself drinking multiples of these in a session if I was just in the mood for something dark/roasty/complex, without the heavy chewy oomph of a stout or double/imperial stout. Very nice indeed. 4.0 out of 5.0.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,dubinsky,4.15,"Received as an extra in a trade with 321Jeff. Poured from 12oz bottle into a Crate and Barrel Snifter.  A - Pours solid black with brownish highlights. A foamy two finger mocha color head was a result of my pour and it quickly folded, leaving behind a nice wall of lace and a small island of foam in the middle of the glass.  S - Smells of rich chocolate malt, caramel, coffee and dark chocolate. I do pick up some hop presence as well.  T - Chocolate up front gives way to a mix of coffee and roasted malt in the back. The finish is a mix of chocolate sweetness and dark roasted malts and coffee.  M - Fairly heavy body and solid flavors with moderate carbonation. I love the creamy texture of this beer as well as the nice bittersweet finish.  O - This porter deserves all the hype it gets. Its a very good example of an American porter. The flavors are spot, the mouthfeel is amazing and its very drinkable. Thanks Jeff!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,SylviaFaye,3.97,"Ruby red highlights ring the dark, opaque body capped by a quickly-fading toffee-colored head.  The nose is a mix of freshly ground coffee and chocolate-covered cherries.  This beer has a smooth, medium mouthfeel paired with a coffee front and a peppery, barley finish. The background hints of cherry and fig.  Overall: This is a pretty good porter, but I've had better, and it is far from my favorite from Great Lakes. Still, it is worth sampling and is refreshing on a hot day.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Eriktheipaman,4.35,Pours a pretty solid black even when held to a light with a tan head.  The smell is right on with the roasted coffee and a clean prickle from the hops and carbonation.  The taste is of mostly roast and coffee with not much on the chocolate side.  This beer tastes veryyy similar to my favorite the Black Butte. A great beer and glad to know some people on the midwest have a comparable Porter!,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Two fingers of puffy head quickly sinks like her namesake ship, leaving behind a rocky coast of lacing on the glass.  A whiff and - hello, roast. Light earthy hops. Burnt vanilla? Yeah, burnt vanilla. My nose, NOT YOURS.  A sip is full, with a smooth mineral body; carbonation slowly builds on the tongue. Warm but thin enough to be refreshing. Roast really hits in the middle, some bitter chocolate and coffee grain; A great acidic tangy bitterness sticks to your mouth through the finish.  This is a super drinkable porter. Tops.

73,226,elgiacomo,3.95,"12oz bottle, unknown date. Big thanks to Adam for hooking me up with a 6-pack from his trip to Ohio. Served at cellar temperature.  Pours dark brown with red highlights and a two finger foamy active light brown head that leaves some clumpy lacing and holds a wispy cap.  Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, some smoke, burnt toast, a touch of dark fruit and maybe a little bit of grassy or herbal hops. Good to very good strength.  Flavor is more roasted malts, some coffee and a bit of chocolate, smoky, toasty, fair sweetness and a touch of bitterness from the hops on the finish. Minimal alcohol.  Mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium, medium to high carbonation.  A very good Porter but not quite as robust as the Founders or Smuttynose offerings.

73,226,azdback,3.79,"Poured into my Surly pint glass. Hyper carbonation!! This filled the glass completely with foam. I let it sit a few and carefully poured the rest of the bottle. Deep, dark brown with light caramel or brown sugar highlights. Head is very active and tan colored. Very creamy and whipped cream in texture. Lace is sticking and probably will to the end.  Smell is of dark roasted malt. A bit of chocolate with some coffee coming through. There is even a bit of vanilla in there. Also maybe the sugar of molasses is there. Quite nice!  The taste is quite a bit different. It's kind of a malt puzzle. There are lots of things going on but I need to put them together in my mind. It's sweet, but almost in a citrus-y way. The roasted flavors are there but they are interrupted by the weird out of place taste of orange rind. The late flavors are of tart fruit.  The mouth is par for the style. A bit watery and thin. Carbonation is fine and it, for the style, stays to end of the swallow.  Overall I am a bit confused by this one. I have been told by many that this is the holy grail of Porters, but I have to disagree. It is a good porter but not at all a great Porter.

Undertones of sweeter malts and caramel.  T-Very smooth roasted malts start here and linger throughout. Any sweetness from chocolate is more background noise than anything.  M-Pretty smooth overall. Carbonation was a bit high.  D-Above average porter but didn't blow me away like I was expecting. I was really psyched for this one. Maybe I need to set my standards a bit lower.

73,226,AmericanGothic,4.13,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Peace Tree pint.  A: Deep brown color with hints of copper. Two fingers of pale tan head with good retention and nice lace.  S: Roasted malts and chocolate. Faint vinous tinge. Not bad, but a little tame.  T: Roasted malts continue with light pepper and unsweetened chocolate. Pepper intensifies on the finish, joined by a little cinnamon and bitter coffee. After a few sips, some sweetness emerges, joined by a little vanilla and a shot of whipped cream-- possibly lactose? All the flavors are well balanced, though a bit understated. Taste continues to evolve as the beer warms, with each part taking a turn on center stage. Faint citrus joins the chocolate. Also a whiff of smoke.  M: Not too heavy, very smooth. Am picking up lactose in the feel as well, but it doesn't overtake things, just lends interest.  O: A delicious porter. A lot of interest in the flavor, just wish that the aromas could keep up with it. Without a doubt, I will buy it again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ludachris,4.07,"If the deep chestnut brown highlights weren't able to be seen when held up to the light, I would have thought the body was ink black. A small cream coloured head forms on top but doesn't have much sticking power. A standard looking porter.  Ah, all the things I look for are in the nose and in plentiful supply. Roasted malts with a smokey edge, fresh coffee grounds and a nuttiness that runs through. Cocoa powder and dark chocolate give it a pleasant sweetness.  Finely roasted malts waste no time at making there way across the palate. A very smooth transition is made from the roasty side to semi-sweet baker's chocolate. There's a creamy nuttiness that sits in the back and continues into the finish. The finish is dry, slightly roasty with a pleasant coffee ground bitterness.  The balance and transitioning of flavours is flawless. The feel leans more towards being medium bodied with some crisp carbonation in the finish.  A well crafted, flavourful, and perfectly balanced porter. I have never really got in to this style, nor have I had many interpretations of it. This explains why my mark is lower than the average. I would love to revisit this in a year or so when I've had a chance to have had more American porters. For now, however, it's quite satisfying.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S - Smells of rich chocolate malt, caramel, coffee with creamer, and some dark chocolate. Solid nose but nothing too mind blowing.  T - Plenty of rich chocolate up front slowly giving way to a mix of coffee and roasted malt. The finish is a mix of chocolate sweetness and dark roast, lingering for a short time. I really like this one a lot.  M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Creamy feel with plenty of lingering sweet roast in the finish. It was a tiny bit on the watery side.

I just clicked on the ones with the most reviews, assuming they were the best ones. Lucky for me, you guys have good taste. We'll call this one a happy accident.  12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours dark dark dark brown, nearly opaque. More than two fingers of tan head, But I can't be sure how much more, since it was on my kitchen counter. It clung on to the bitter fucking end.  Aroma is roasty as all get-out. Got a bit of caramel and a lot of coffee. Maybe there's even some vanilla in there? I'm slowly improving with this stuff.  Took a sip, and it was like drinking black coffee from Jesus' nipple. I honestly can't even tell if the bitterness is hops or roast, but it rules so hard. That was definitely vanilla I was smelling, and I got more and more chocolate with every sip. Shit, I don't even drink my coffee black, and I love this.  A creamy and satisfying texture. Not so thick that I feel like I ate a loaf of bread, but a nice firm handshake. This lacing WILL. NOT. DISSIPATE. It's 20 minutes later, I'm two-thirds done, and there's still a film over the entire surface of the glass. Ye gods, man.  A tremendously good porter. So glad I can get a hold of these fairly easily.

Aroma is of much roast, lots of malt, a bit of coffee and even some toffee. Definitely gets a lot better at it warms up.  Tastes mirrors the nose well, as the flavors mesh well together. Perhaps a hint of vanilla in there. This is a great example of what I think a porter should be. It comes off as very well rounded. Nothing is too dominant and it's got a smooth finish with little bitterness.  Mouthfeel is pretty good, prickly on the tongue, not real heavy, but not TOO light some porters I've had.

Nice one finger mocha head dissipates quickly but leaves a little creamy lacing along the glass.  The aroma is pure roasted malt and chocolate.  The flavor is a very well balanced mix of toasty malt and bittersweet chocolate. Some minor dark fruit notes and licorice blend into the background with a little bit of a bitter coffee finish.  Light mouthfeel that is very drinkable. Excellent Porter.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,DrewV,4.82,"Poured from a bottle (drink by 9/18/11) out of my beer fridge (45 degrees) into a Spiegelau Stemmed Pilsner (tulip).  A: Deep garnet color, not black. A medium pour produces a one-finger, khaki-colored head which dissipates fairly quickly. Lacing is generous.  S: Roasty, toasty malts, rich coffee-like chocolate, no hops in the nose. Aromas increase as the beer warms. Best suited to 50+ degrees.  T: A bit thin up front, the flavor builds more strongly and follows the aroma closely, finishing oily with a residual not-so-bitter chocolate aftertaste. Possibly a bit smoky as the mouth dries up. Definitely leaves you anxious for the next sip. As the beer warms, the flavors intensify slightly and move from the finish to the front.  M: A bit watery/thin up front, building through the adequate carbonation into a full, oily finish. Carbonation is moderate, but perfectly fits this beer.  O: One of the best, if not THE best, porters out there. True to style with a well-refined flavor profile. My second favorite GLB beer behind Eliot Ness. Despite the somewhat thin feel up front and through the middle, the roasty malts and chocolate finish really combine to make this beer absolutely outstanding.

Leaves beautiful lacing. Really the ideal appearance you'd want from this style brew.  Smells of freshly roasted coffee, fine dark chocolate, and some sweet malts. Delicious!  Taste is mostly of burnt coffee and a slight hue of bitter chocolate. The roast overwhelmed all the other flavors in here. Still enjoyable, but after the smell I was really expecting more.  Mouthfeel is quite smooth with medium carbonation.  Overall, it's definitely an enjoyable brew from Great Lakes. I did just get off an 8 hours shift of serving tables so its very possible my body was too tired to pull out the beauty in this beer. I felt it was just average for the style.

A one finger light tan head forms and quickly recedes leaving a cap/lacing.  Smell: Coffee right of the bat. Mixed with some other roasty flavors. Just a great pungent smell that makes me want to keep inhaling this beer.  Taste: Very very light coffee flavor, much more prevalent with the nose. A little bit of sweetness on the back end and a mild bitterness, seemingly moreso from the dark malts than the hops. Very pleasant.  Mouthfeel: Perfect for a porter. Not too heavy, not light, quite carbonated but not overly so. It has a slightly creamy mouthfeel.  Overall: Great ""no frills"" beer.

73,226,TheBrewo,4.22,"We pour a brew the color of watered down cola. It holds a one finger cream colored head, with huge sticky bubbles around the glass as the head recedes. The retention is good and this occurs at a slower pace. No sediment is noted and the carbonation appears to be medium. The aroma is huge with deeply roasty malts. Bittersweet hints of cacao, cool coffee bean, and a metallic twinge of yeast slowly begin to peek through the darkness. There is sweetening toffee, but no other caramel flavoring or buttery diacetyls are present. As we sip, roasted malts hit up front, in all of their dark, bittering glory. This is cut partially by a mild chocolate flavoring. The malts calm down through the middle, but the peak is characterized by a full smokiness, of burnt malts or charcoal. The finish is incredibly smooth, with bittering from unsweetened cacao and more of those great bitter malts. There is a balance of cool, sweetness here, lent from white sugar and an earthiness that comes across like honey, helping to balance the strong flavoring otherwise. The aftertaste breathes with roasty malts, big smokiness, and fresh coffee bean. The body is medium, and on the thicker end for a porter. The carbonation is medium and not overly contributory. There is a nice froth and slurp to each sip, with the mouth feeling nicely coated. The tongue is left dry, however, with the bitterness and metal of raw coffee. The abv is within range and the beer drinks easily.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the balance between the sweetness and the smoky, roasty qualities. The nose was also huge, with all of the necessary aromatics making their presence abundantly clear. While the basis of this style focuses on the deeply roasted malts and those other dark flavors, this beer integrates a genuine smokiness to it, but does not allow itself to become overpowered. This remains exemplary for the style, while adding a uniqueness of flavoring.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Deep dark brown with very little transparency.  S: Chocolaty coffee with roasted notes. The aroma is as thick as the taste.  T: Full-bodied rich flavor with roasted malt and chocolate in the nose with a heavy finish of coffee, but none of these over powering the others.  M: Heavy coating due to the thick and rich texture of this porter.  D: Very nice.

73,226,mellowmark,4.59,"Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle to a Leffe Chalice. Enjoy by 07-15-11. $15.49 for a 12-pack sampler.  Appearance: Pours dark brown with a 2-finger creamy mocha head. Moderate retention, decent lacing.  Smell: Big coffee and chocolate notes. Slight citrus and a moderate earthy hop profile. A big smoky character brings it all together. Pure cane sugar. Vanilla. Awesome.  Taste: Sweet with an enormous roasted character that just coats your entire mouth. Citrus, roasted coffee and dark chocolate linger on the palate long after. Citrus leaves the mouth juicy. Decent hop profile adds a nice earthiness and a slight bitter quality.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is medium with a medium carbonation. Very smooth. The carbonation could be just a little lower, although it does not detract from the experience in any way.  Drinkability: High  Overall this is a great porter with a big profile yet a rather modest ABV making it a perfect session brew. Very highly recommended.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Review from notes:  A vigorous pour yields 3 fingers of tan head, about the same color as the top of a cup of hot cocoa.  Beer is extremely dark brown, almost black.  Smells are coffee, some cocoa, a touch of smokiness and roasty malts.  Tastes pretty much like the nose, coffe, chocolate, a little smokiness, delicious.  Mouthfeel is heavy, a lot of body.  Drinkability is good.  Great beer, I'm very disappointed and surprised that Indy doesn't get Great Lakes but northern Indiana does.  ",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The aroma is of smoked malts and sweet carmel undertones of chocolate, yum  Tastes amazing like it smells, nothing unexpected, but then the floral notes of a mild hops comes in, hardly any bitterness.  This just feels good in the mouth, creamy soft notes and a very mild bitterness that makes it a soft complex drinker.  Overall I really like the sample from glbc, a very good example of a Porter.

Held to the light, it shows some ruby red hues but for the most part is opaque dark brown. Smell is off coffee with some roasted nuts on the back end. Taste is similar to the smell with a bit of chocolate malt showing through as well. The roasted malts in this make a good appearance and some hop bitterness comes through to balance out each sip. Mouthfeel seems a little on the watery side and carbonation is in the medium range which makes it pretty enjoyable.

73,226,jakeaustin,4.22,"Pours a deep dark brown from the 12oz bottle into a basic pint glass. Crimson on the edges under direct light. A couple of inches of tan head forms, and most of it lingers for quite a while. Tons of thick lacing as the level drops.  Smell is simple but very nice. Coffee and chocolate. Milk chocolate mostly with quite a bit of medium roast coffee.  Taste is nearly identical. Almost perfectly balanced between coffee and chocolate. As the beer warms roasted coffee beans become apparent. The finish is all coffee. Just enough bitterness to balance everything out.  Very smooth and creamy on the palate. Flavor lingers for a long time. Something I didn't expect from a 5.8% beer. Pretty basic, but very enjoyable porter from Great Lakes.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Rough pour produces a good inch of tan head that dissipates down to about a centimeter, leaves great lacing down the glass.  S: Smells like milk chocolate and cream, coffee, some light burnt notes, simple but very appealing.  T: Starts with a real nice coffee and milk chocolate flavor, similar to the nose. Some smokey and caramel notes in the background. Ends with some nice roasted malts, like black coffee, and some hops. Semidry finish.  M: Medium bodied, good carbonation, rich, creamy mouthfeel, with a nice roasted finish, leaves just the right amount of coating on your palate.  O: Excellent, very tasty and highly drinkable.

Many moons ago I was a porter fanatic, however being 40 years old , soon too be 41 I was limited to the Redhook porter , the Sierrea Nevada Porter and the finest Porter of all time !!! From the now defunct Chicago Brewing CO, BIG SHOULDERS PORTER, Thank you Greg Mohen for the best Porter ever. But over the last ten years or so the Edmund Fitzgerald Kicks some Major ASS !!! None better.  The smell is sooo deep and complex, think dark chocolate, a mildly scented coffee mixed with a liberal dose of creamy cocoa and a caramel scented finnish to boot. Amazing !!!  The taste is unbelievable for a bottled beer... Rich notes of Pipe Tobbacco, Chocolate and layered Caramel malts that are perfectly balanced by a liberal hopping from Northern Brewer, Fuggle and Cascade &lt; That lead to an all too wonderful lingering Chocolately and hoppy Synergistic blend.  This is an amazing beer that I'm sure will hold the test of time,,,, There is not another Porter that is more complex and drinkable than this. All hail the king of kings.  SUPREMELY SESSIONABLE TOO SAY THE LEAST !!!  Just grab some, and do not hesitate to grab a twelver as you will definately be drinking them in rapid succession !!!

Lacing is decent. Deep brown hues, near black when looking through the glass.  smell - Malt, roasted malt. Toffee and coffee. Lovely.  taste - Head is creamy. Roasted malts are upfront and very good. They give off this delicious roasted coffee flavor. Finish is bittersweet and smooth, just slightly creamy. Aftertaste is of roasted malt and coffee beans.  mouthfeel - Nice enough carbonation to give the brew texture but not mask the flavors it holds. Somewhat creamy finish. Just a touch on the thin side.  overall - A great porter. I recommend it to many.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,AlexFields,3.97,"Pour from bottle into pint glass  A: Nice dark porter. The head was a little thin, but probably just because of a weak pour.  S: Roasty coffee and chocolate. I can smell porter bitterness. A little smoke. The nose isn't huge (again, maybe partly because of the pour), but what aroma there is is very nice.  T: The flavor is bigger than the nose. Big, almost stout-like roastiness. More coffee and less chocolate than I guessed from the aroma, and less of the bitterness. The more I drink the more I'm tasting coffee, and woody smoke as well. Somewhat on the dark side for a porter, you could almost pass this off as a weak stout. Very tasty.  M: This beer gets to have some of the nice dark flavors you usually look for in stouts while being more drinkable than a stout. The carbonation is maybe slightly too high though, slightly tingly in the mouth. Maybe that's part of the cost of high drinkability.  O: One of the better standard (as in, no added flavors and not high gravity) porters I've had. I don't buy a lot of porters as I generally prefer brown ales and stouts among dark beers, but I could see myself buying this fairly often if it were distributed in TN.  8.0/10",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,veinless,4.5,"Thanks to AwYeh for this one, I've been waiting to have this porter for a while.  Pours a dark brown/black with deep maroon hints only in the light. Head is two fingers and retains averagely leaving swirls on top. Lacing on the glass is spotty and  Nose is an awesome blend of smoke, wood and bitter chocolate. Beyond that, an intense nuttiness and dark fruit aroma adds still more to the complexity - great smelling beer.  Taste has a lot more fruit at the fore, but it quickly moves to decadent smoky chocolate. The chocolate is a deep bitter, and combined with a smooth woody character in the body, is just about as good as it gets in a porter. Nuttiness makes it still more delicious. Bit of coffee at the end combined with the roasted smoke is just awesome.The balance and diversity of flavors is incredibly well done. I'd love for the chocolate to be even more amplified, but the other flavors might suffer if that happened anyways.  Mouthfeel is smooth and slick, with a pleasant medium body and a smoky coffee finish that aids the drinkability as well. The beer lingers on the palate but isn't sticky or anything - it works great. Drinkability is fantastic due to the good balance of flavors and solid mouthfeel, along with the low abv. After being told this was 9$ a six-pack, I am stunned - this has to be one of the best deals there is.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BieresDesMoines,4.46,"This is one damn fine beer, the first porter to compete with Anchor in my book. The beer pours with a tight small head and a hazy ruby color. The aroma is vanilla and mocha with strong chocolate notes. The aroma is simple but pungent and very effective. The flavor is at first roasty coffee with plenty of vanilla with some chocolate and some berries. This beer besides all of its vanilla and chocolate remains dry and the hop bitterness shines through very well. The texture is creamy and silky. Just a showboat of a session beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,greenmonstah,4.29,"12 oz bottle into pint glass. Best by 6/14/2011  A - Pours a dark brown with half a finger of light brown head. Some bubbles can be seen, and you can see through the beer if held up to a light. Poor retention and average lacing. Could use a more substantial head.  S - As soon as the bottle is cracked you get hit with the incredible aroma. Bitter dark chocolate aroma is intense and delicious. Coffee is there too, but the chocolate steals the show. Some roast and a touch of hop round it out perfectly.  T - Getting bittersweet chocolate and coffee, in addition to a touch of hop. Roasted malts and a smokeyness are also present in droves. Finish is like eating dark chocolate. Delicious.  M - Medium to light body with nice active carbonation. Just right for a porter, it's substantial without being filling. Finish dries out quite a bit.  O - The porter to end all porters. I am often disappointed by porters because I would simply prefer their beefier cousin, the stout, but there are few beers better than this. It smells and tastes amazing, and the feel for this style is spot on. Really quite brilliant. Drinks very easily, and is even better on draft at the taproom.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S- The bottle says the beer has smokey, dark, chocolate, and coffee notes. I am not sure how a beer smells ""dark"" but I'll vouch for the other three. Chocolate being the strongest. T- Starts with a bittersweet chocolate flavor. Coffee and smoke are noticeable but in the background. Finish is a long chocolate and hoppy one. Characteristic Cascade presence. M- Full bodied porter, but I would have liked them to tone back the carbonation as I found ita bit overaggressive particularly in the finish.

Smells of smoke, coffee and maybe some licorice hiding in the back. The roasty notes are what you'd expect in something this dark.  On the palate, it's like coffee and bittersweet chocolate are duking it out. Roasted malts are nice, but I'll take the coffee and chocolate any day.  Really creamy in the mouth. Starts off with a sweetness, followed by a little smoke and then a touch of bitter in the finish.  The beer really goes down easy.

I miss Great-Aunt Rita and Great-Uncle Max from Parma and my last visit in 2007 damn near got me both jailed and killed. I gotta go back soon.

As a retired sailor, the song brings tears to my eyes, but I loooovvvve drinking this beer. My aggro pour produced two thick foamy fingers' worth of deep-tan head with fantastic retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown with ruby highlights. Nose smelled like a milk chocolate bar or better yet, putting your nose into a tin of cocoa powder. Suddenly, I was transported into my late maternal grandmother's kitchen where she let me make my own chocolate milk as a kid. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but close. Bittersweet, not so much, but chocolate and coffee were definitely in evidence on the tongue. Jesus, I could drink this all day, especially when it's cold and damp out or the chill rain beats against the windows. If only they would begin CANning ... Finish had a smoky quality that reminded me of the burned out home in Montreal that we passed each day on our way to the Metro to go to Mondial de la Biere in 2002. Really smoky.

Tastes follow the nose with milk and dark chocolate that quickly switches to an espresso and cream (I guess that's a latte), not too sweet or bitter in any way. There may be some hops in here which may be contributing some bitterness but they aren't descernable at all. Body and mouthfeel are pleasantly full and also perfectly carbonated.

I had hoped, at one point, to find a beer that I liked better than this one...I'll keep searching, but now doubt I'll ever find it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

With the hops as well  T: The maltiness and hoppiness meet in the middle and provide a perfect taste to this porter, wow it is good!

73,226,Gunslinger711,4.33,"Group tasting notes from 2-18-11 Poured out of a bottle. Served in a goblet.  A- Pours out dark like coffee with a finger or two of beautiful, dark head, also a good amount of lacing.  S- Smells like weak burnt coffee, a little caramel smell at the beginning.  M- The mouthfeel is a little lighter than expected, almost watered down.  T- Extremely drinkable, you get coffee without the bite and some cocoa and malt notes in there.  D- See above comment, which bears repeating, extremely drinkable, this is the porter you could start non-beer drinkers on.  Food: Among the cheeses we tried with this beer, the smoked gouda brought out a little more sweetness in it.  Overall: This was what you could call a ""session porter"" as annoying as I find the ""session"" term. Easy to drink, a good example of a porter, and for the one non-beer drinker we had, she liked it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,AlCaponeJunior,4.3,"Got this one in a trade from optimator13. I've always been a big fan of the Tale of the Edmund Fitzgerald, Great selection man!  Black with just a touch of dark-brown, good clarity, relatively low carbonation but smooth and silky bubbles accented a mild head with good lacing.  Smell is lightly roasted malts, with some caramel-toffee, coffee, and smooth easy going earth tones.  Taste is quite a surprise after the smell. Easy going smooth roasted malts are actually quite powerful in their flavorful goodness. There's a bit of a hops bite, despite it not being very hoppy in the aroma. No shortage of coffee or chocolate either.  Feel is medium, smooth, rich, and lightly sweet, whilst still maintaining a dark cocoa and hoppy bitter aftertaste.  Drink is quite good. For a porter, it's pretty spot on for style and flavor. For any beer in general, it's definitely a hit.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,cneville,4.18,"As I lived in Cleveland for a while, I've had this beer a few times, including on draft, but never reviewed it. Since I am having yet another, now seemed as good of a time as any.  Appearance: Poured a very dark brown, nearly opaque when held up to light, with a 1 finger head that left a little lacing when it fell.  Smell: Coffee, initially. Then a little chocolate  Taste: Hard to describe, but really everything a porter should be. Nice and heavy, a little bit of sweetness.  Mouthfeel: A little carbonation, good feel.  Drinkability: Could easily put back a six pack of these, but that would be irresponsible on a weeknight I suppose.  One of Great Lakes' strongest beers, that's for sure. Really is one of the best parts about Ohio.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

A deeper smell reveals those caramely malts and smokiness. Just a wonderful smelling beer, one of the very best.  T - An incredibly full taste. Good amounts of roast coffee, light cocoa, and a bit of sweet malt. Just a tiny bit of bitterness. A very complex and delicious taste.  M - Very thick and creamy, dries the mouth just a bit on finish, no hints of alcohol.  D - It's a very filling beer, but also very drinkable. It's a good warming beer. It's a little cold tonight and this beer does a great job of keeping me warm.  Overall - It's been a couple years since I've had an Edmund Fitzgerald and I can honestly say I did not appreciate it enough.

73,226,mlazzaro,3.8,"12 oz bottle my buddy found in his beer cellar. I gave the beer some slack on being slightly under-carbonated as it was a year old + in the bottle. Aside from that it was a quite enjoyable beer. Looks opaque and black. Little brown head. Both the mouthfeel and smell would be greatly enhanced with more carbonation. Aroma is chocolaty and sweet Tastes super malty, with a deep chocolate flavor. Remarkably smooth. This particular bottle reminds me of English beer, served slightly warmer and slightly less carbonated. Worked well as a desert beer. Great example of an American Porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,zeledonia,4.77,"A: Pours very dark, almost black, with reddish-brown at the edges. The one-finger tan head leaves good lacing.  S: Rich dark roasted malts. Nice chocolate and anise coming through, with a bit of bitterness in the background. Wonderfully complex and fantastically spot-on for a porter.  T: Delicious from the first taste. A near-perfect porter. Taste is a lot like the smell, but heavier on the bitter dark roasted malts, a bit less of the more subtle flavors. Nice smooth slightly bitter finish. Could be a bit more complex, but really darn good.  M: Amazingly smooth. Medium-heavy, with just a bit of carbonation to balance it out. This is, once again, pretty near perfect for a porter.

73,226,Looneybiz,4.5,So this has the right appearance of a porter. Black and cant see thru it at all with about an inch and a half of dark tan head.  The smell was actually not as strong as you would think but you could pick out a touch of roasted coffee aroma along with the typical porter smell.  Whats great about this beer is the taste pure and simple. Its exceptional with the hint of coffee and chocolate in the malty porter taste. Great Lakes really hit the nail on the head with the flavor of this beer. Its not overly bitter but instead has a complex taste that you will learn to crave.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,dali27,4.67,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: Beautiful dark brown with a nice dark tan head. The head sticks around as the beer is drunk around the sides of the glass.  S: Very aromatic. Rich malty flavors along with coffee and dark chocolate let you know that you are going to be in for a treat.  T: What can I say about the taste of this beer? I think that it is incredibly balanced, and this makes it excellent. All of the aspects that you are looking for in a porter are there, and they are done so well.  M: The feel of this beer is very much on the thicker side, and probably borders on that of a stout. Nothing wrong with that.  D: Please pour me another!  I have to say that this beer is excellent and possibly is the best representation of the American Porter style. I have always been partial to Summit's Great Northern Porter (my homer porter), but this one might have it beat. At the very least at ties in my heart as the best out there.

Gives off a three finger nice tan head. Bubbles are all very uniform in size and makes a nice cap. Body is a very dark walnut brown clear with some nice red hues. Some lacing is visible while finishing the drink.  Bouquet is a very simple creamy roast, some hidden mild chocolate notes, and toasted malt, a little arid. Great smelling beer.  Taste is fairly good, kind of basic with a simple body, a little wet though and carbonated. Missing alot on the nose which I though would make a slightly bolder statement in the mouth. Has a cola sweet finish almost like a milk stout.  Still very good drinkability and a good solid beer from Great Lakes.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Sugary taste is overtaken by roasted malts. Milk chocolate, coffee, charcoal, woody/nutty tastes, and smoke. Pretty much encompassed the whole spectrum of roasted malt tastes. Citric hops provide a quick bite of bitterness. Seems ever-so-slightly acidic too. Distinct Hershey's chocolate taste returns just before the finish.

On tasting I am pleased with the smoothness of the mouthfeel, not weak like some porters, really bordering on more of what I find in stouts. Carbonation is readily apparent but doesn't become overbearing. Taste is exceptional. Perfect blend of the light chocolate and coffee roast present in aromas. Some biscuity goodness is there as well.

Smell - A slight berry smell, like blackberries or prunes. It smells more like a stout than I expected. A faint hint of bourbon as well.  Taste - A very smooth porter that is very consistent. A deep oat and barley taste accompanied by a sweet and slightly tart fruit bite. Light cocoa with a slight burn. I don't think I have ever had a beer this consistent in flavor before.  Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Easily drinkable because of its consistent taste. A little tang on the tongue that ties in perfectly.

T: Obvious coffee taste, roasted chocolate is there, but not as strong as the aroma would have made me assume. Very smooth, velvety. Oak in the background  M: Very smooth, went down easily. Good clean finish.  D: Not 'filling' as many stouts /strong porters can be, so drinkibility is very easy. Very delicious, and would pair great with a dessert, or by itself.

Aroma-Roasted malt aromas-almost intoxicatingly chocolatey. Hint of coffee. Negligible hops. Enticing.  Flavor-A lot more coffee in the flavor than in the aroma-the flavor presents an elegant blend of chocolate and coffee. No hop flavor really to speak of, and a bit husky in the finish, though good for the most part.  Mouthfeel-Medium body with moderately carbonation. Feel a bit too light on the palate for the style. A touch of alcohol warmth is there as well. Some sharpness from roasted malt.  This is a very solid porter, but its a little bit sharp/astringent, I'm assuming from the roasted malts.

Taste- This is hard to call it a porter. Doesn't drink like one to me. More of a baby coffee stout. Great tasting beer. Well balanced.  Mouth- A nice low/medium body with a medium carb level.

The aroma is of coffee, roast malts and cocoa. Though it is very well blended and no one flavor stands more than the other. The taste follows the nose, with perhaps a bit more emphasis on the cocoa malts.  The mouthfeel has a pretty average body, with decent carbonation.  Overall a very well done and easy drinking beer.

73,226,weizenbob,4.36,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Enjoy by date of 7/2/11. Two fingers of mocha-colored head form off the pour. Head retention is phenomenal. This porter is deep walnut in color with some visible carbonation. Thick sticky lacing lines the glass.  The nose is a combination of chocolate and roasted malts. Bitter coffee is noted in the mix. Initially the aroma seems a little watery, but a subtle creamy quality eventually emerges.  The initial attack on the tongue is pretty dull; then out of nowhere the flavors suddenly come alive in the mouth. Roasted malts provide a sharp charcoal quality. There is a pretty literal coffee essence, and even a touch of cocoa in the finish. The label claims that this porter adheres to Bavarian Purity Law yet Great Lakes has masterfully manipulated the four classic beer ingredients to imply flavors that simply aren't there. Alcohol goes nearly unnoticed. Perceived bitterness is a bit higher than I've come to expect from today's porters. This seems to be a result of the below average sweetness. The combo is refreshingly classic.  The brew is pretty light bodied. A moderate amount of carbonation keeps things moving easily. I do wish that it were a little heavier, but that is more of a matter of personal preference than a problem with adherence to style.  With such a great flavor and light mouthfeel, Edmund Fitzgerald is a pretty drinkable porter. In spite of the high drinkability, this is not a session beer (even though I badly want to reach for another). ABV is listed at 5.8% but about 2/3 of the way through the glass I was starting to feel the alcohol. However, it is easy to see why Edmund Fitz is the highest rated porter on Beer Advocate. It is delicious, easy drinking, and a great value to boot.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) I enthusiastically give two Schlitz for Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. This is the best thing coming out of Cleveland.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S - Very dark and roasty, tons of dark malt, coffee, roasted nuts and perhaps just a whiff of smoke. Again, smells like a Porter should smell.

73,226,awalk1227,4.57,"Consumed 1/25/11 received this in a trade from my BA Secret Santa!  Poured into a Duvel Parra tulip  A: Pours a slippery, deep, dark brown into my tulip. When held to the light, the slightest dark shade of crimson comes out on the bottom of the glass. An aggressive pour yields a one finger thick, khaki head. It recedes to hug the glass, leaving a few large bubbles in the middle.  S: This has as much of an aroma as any stout I've ever had. Deep roasted nuts, chocolate, and perhaps a spice of hops grace my nostrils.  T: It begins with a milk chocolate character swirling about my tongue, becoming ever more bitter and roasted on the finish. After swallowing, a pleasant smoky aftertaste follows. I haven't had many porters, or loved any, but I can see how this one remains arguably the best. For such a light beer (comparatively to others--it doesn't even break 6%ABV) it packs a lot of flavor. I find this is hard to do with lower ABV beers unless you're dry hopping the crap out of them.  F: Cool and silky on my palate, with a great amount of carbonation to hold it up and keep me refreshed.  D: This beer is dark enough to satisfy any malt craving, but cool and refreshing enough to drink in any weather.

73,226,cwcolby74,3.87,"I drank this from a 12 oz bottle purchased wk. of Dec. 19 at Woodman's West in Madison, WI. Consumed in a Guinness pint glass.  Appearance - Syrupy pour, chocolate brown in color. Bits here and there of a small amount of carbonation. Very little head or lacing present. It looks appetizing, as I am a fan of this style, but nothing too special.  Smell - Rich, bittersweet. Notes of mostly coffee, with a secondary aroma of chocolate underneath. It doesn't smell boozy or overdone like some porters that are trying to imitate stouts. It has a roasted quality to it that I kind of like.  Taste - I let it warm up in the glass at room temperature for about 10 minutes to bring out all the flavor. The taste is more bitter than sweet. It has a nice smoothness and richness to it. It leaves a strong roasted aftertaste, probably the most memorable or remarkable aspect to the beer. The flavor is good but doesn't knock you over.  Mouthfeel - It has a strong backbone to it. It feels solid and substantial going down. I tend to like a little more ""character"" to the flavor and mouthfeel. This somewhat lacks that punch.  Drinkability: It's good, maybe great, but not what I'd call outstanding. It doesn't give me an overly heavy feeling, which is good. It's a good representation of the style.

73,226,LacquerHead,3.78,"I was drinking this beer during the Chicago Bears and Seattle playoff game. Go Bears! I poured this into an 11oz mug. It poured a rather transparent dark brown. It looked like a really dark brown ale. The head was a tan color that formed a strong lacing.  This had a roasted aroma - kind of coffee like. There wasn't much to it.  The taste was a little thin. It tasted much better as it warmed up a bit. It had a standard roasted porter taste. Most of the flavors are on the subdued side. It had a light bitterness and smoky flavor. Don't get me wrong it was good quality, just not standout-ish.  M/F: a little thin for a porter. It started off with a carbonated bite but then finished a little flat.  Drinkability: It has a decent drinkability, probably due to its light flavor.  Conclusion: the memory of this beer will be favorable only because the Bears beat the Seahawks. This was more like a sessional porter. I easily drank a six-pack during the game. I would reach for this if I wanted a non-sipping porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Jesstyr,4.03,"Served in a pint glass at Churchkey in DC.  Exceedingly dark, essentially black, with a great 2 fingers of brown head, ideal for the style. Nose is nutty and full of smoke, overall its a pleasant scent that matches the beer ideally.  Taste kicks off with tons of nutty malt with a tinge of smokiness that balances nicely. Hops kick in at the end, and are not overwhelming, just a pleasant finish. Mouthfeel is thick and full overall making this a more drinkable beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ChristianBlack,3.56,"Very dark, with a frothy head and good retention.  Smoky, somewhat metallic nose. Coffee is very pronounced throughout.  Smooth, creamy. The mouthfeel really pretty good and finishes clean. Alcohol is well hidden.  Malty backbone, much like the nose. Somewhat watered down and I can't pick up much at first. Not overly complex with isn't necessarily a bad thing.  A good straightforward porter, although I'm not as impressed with it as others. The drinkibiliy is pretty good on this one and the balance is nice. Overall, a very solid beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,StoutHunter,4.33,"I Got a six pack of this last week since I haven't had it in a while and last I remember it was an outstanding porter. So let's if this brew lives up to my memory of it. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a pint glass.  A- This beer pours a nice deep black color with some ruby highlights on the edges. It had two fingers worth of tan head that died down to a thin ring that left a good amount of lacing. I like the label for this beer, it's a sweet picture of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  S- The aroma is full of roasted malts along with a good amount of coffee and some sweet chocolate.  T- Just like the aroma the roasted malts lead the way to some lots of coffee, chocolate and a little smokiness. There is a slight present of bitter hops at the end that i couldn't pick up in the aroma.  M- Medium thick bodied and creamy with excellent carbonation.  D- This beer is about as drinkable as porters get. The nice flavors, great balance, and little alcohol presence make this a very drinkable porter.  Overall just like last time I had this beer I ended up thinking about how great of porter this is. This brew had everytIhing I look for and want in a great porter. This beer has become a regular in my fridge and is one of my favorite porter. Great job GLBC.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Looks beautiful  Smells of Caramelized burnt sugar and rich chocolate Malts  Medium to full in body with a big malty mouth full up front, a undertone of caramel, coffee / chocolate flavour. Hop bitterness leaves a tingle on the tongue and helps to dull the sweetness. More hop character comes though and leaves a earthy grassy taste. There is an almost a cake dry finish to the brew ... delicious!  One damn fine Porter",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Smell - toasted malts with prevalent coffee hints as well as some toffee and vanilla .  Taste - The taste of molasses was the first thing to come to mind then some mild malt hints with coffee and caramel and maybe even a touch of vanilla .  Drinkability - -= This is a very well blended and balanced porter and am impressed with the way it's flavors are more prevalent as it warms up a little- very well made porter.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,TheBear11D,4.65,"22oz glass  Pours a very nice dark brown to black color with a foamy deep brown bubbly head that hung around for a while and left wonderful lacing.  Smells of smokey coffee and cocoa, just plenty of malt goodness dominating the nose.  Tastes coffee is the most noticeable, but smokey chocolate is right behind the coffee. There is just a hint of hops tucked way back, but it helps to round off the beer.  Medium to thick body with average carbonation. Quite smooth.  Good flavor and extremely drinkable.

73,226,CuriousMonk,3.82,"Had this on tap from Stoney's in DC as well from 12oz bottles poured in a pint glass in the past. Pours a dark, roasty cedar brown color with fleeting glimpses of a ruby sheen. The aroma is a pleasant balance between chocolate and dark fruits. A rich, dark belgian chocolate base is softened by some juicy prune and sticky raisins. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel. The flavors are much drier than the aroma suggests, and the body may be a touch thinned by age. Dark, dry chocolate flavors with a bit of smoked ash coming through on the back end. More chocolate and a smidgen of prune linger in the final smack with a gentle kiss of minty hops.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Ghenna,3.79,"Part of the Xmas beertrade on reddit.com, thanks again to Ttrav in WV for this trade  Super deep ruby with a finger of tan head, nice lacing.  Caramel, chocolate, malt in the nose. Super creamy mouth feel, pleasant mix of sweet, chocolate, and roast malt.  I've just reviewed the Speakeasy payback porter, and man does this have a creamy MF by comparison- a lot more milk chocolate-y by comparison. Roastyness on the end of the taste chocolate as well.  The flavor of the beer sticks around on the tongue for a bit, though I wouldn't call it chewy it definitely is a little thick.  This is a really nice porter. It is a little bit lighter in terms of taste (though heavier in terms of MF) than the Payback porter I just reviewed, I think that on the whole I like it better. This is definitely a beer I would like to try on draft, and if I ever make it to the midwest I will go out of my way to do so.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

I was pretty stoked for this, I have heard such raves for the Edmund, and growing up in MI I have many fond memories of singing the old Lightfoot tune around the boy scout bonfire.  Pours vigorously and black, a nice tan head. Aroma is roasty and woody, taste is thin and dry with a tinge of earthy hops and blackened grain. The mouthfeel is thin though, thinner than an American porter should be.  I enjoyed it listening to some Miles Davis and warming dinner after a long day of getting work trucks stuck in the field.

Nice opaque almost black beer with tawny edges.  Smell: Nice roasty chocolate smell.  Taste: Bittersweet chocolate and roastiness. I cant really hone in on what flavors are present, I just know it tastes good.  Mouthfeel: On the thicker side with a nice ability to coat the mouth with flavor. Carbonation is on the low side.  Drinkability: This is a lower ABV beer with no overbearing flavors, so this has good drinkability. But I cannot get it in Utah.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,ZeroSignal,4.18,"12 oz bottle  A - Appears to pour out a chestnut brown, but in the glass is pitch black with a good sized, light mocha-colored head. Great retention and sticky lacing  S - Lot's of roasted, toasted, earthy and slightly burnt/ashy smells. Some hop bitterness in there as well. Some coffee and espresso notes in the back.  T&M - All of the olfactory notes show through brilliantly in the flavor. On the lighter bodied side of a porter. The earthy, ashy maltiness is balanced nicely by an earthy, slightly grassy hop presence; in fact more hops then I'm used to from a porter, but these are used so well here. Coffee, espresso and chocolate notes follow. Finish is earthy with a lingering malt and chocolate presence and just a touch of alcohol.  D - A highly drinkable porter with great depth and character. Plenty to keep me interested and a great, light ABV to boot.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,spinrsx,4.1,"12oz Bottle  Appearance - The beer pours an opaque black/brown colour with a very large frothy and fizzy light brown coloured head. I can't see much carbonation due the darkness of the beer and there is some very nice lacing running in stages down the sides of the glass. The head lasted for several minutes before it began to dissipate.  Smell - chocolate, malts, coffee, burnt nuts  Taste & Mouth - The beer has an average amount of carbonation and feels very creamy. Most of the taste consists of chocolate, coffee and malts. There is also a burnt flavour that causes the beer to have a smoke taste and some light hops. The beer finishes with bitter/burnt aftertaste.  Drink - I really enjoyed this beer, it's got lot of flavour but it isn't too overpowering.

73,226,circlenine,4.18,"Poured from bottle into tulip on 1/7/11 and reviewed in notebook. Review transcribed 1/8/11. Bottle had a best buy May 2011 date.  A: Pours deep dark brown allowing no light through. Approximately 1"" head with carbonation quickly rising to the top in a creamy brown color.  S: At first I couldn't identify the smell, although I knew it was something sweet. At first I though perhaps chocolate, but it didn't seem strong enough. It's more like the faint smell of coffee ice cream. More nose time identified a smell that resembled caramel, however seemed a little sweeter like butterscotch*. Based on smell, I feared this beer would be too sweet for my liking.  T: Holy cow, this is not what I expected to taste. I am thrilled! It is robust, it is smokey. There is a roasted matiness in the front, and a definite strong smoke taste in the back. The roast tasted must be from the coffee as at times the initial taste resembles something strong like an espresso bean. Not bitter at all with no after taste.  M: This beer has a medium feel to it, but it is full of flavor that reaches all parts of the mouth. Little carbonation, it is easy on the tongue and lips.  D: Smooth like silk. Easy to drink. Can see myself drinking a 6 pack in two sittings.  Comments: Overall I am very impressed by this brew. This would and should be my go to porter, but it can't be because of my location. Guess my ship will have completely sunk after my 6 pack is gone.  Note: * In reading other reviews and descriptions of the beer, this is probably molasses, but with very little molasses experience, it resembled aforementioned caramel and butterscotch.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,corby112,4.38,"From notes:  Pours a very dark chestnut brown that appears pitch black in the glass with mahogany edges when held to a light source and a thick frothy, pillowy tan head that isn't gong anywhere. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the glass with streaks and spots of soapy lacing.  Very roasted malt aroma with hints of silky chocolate, caramel, oatmeal and slight burnt toast.  Chewy medium body that's on the fuller end with lots of silky chocolate and roasted malt flavor. Slightly acrid and overly roasty but their is a lactic cream presence that smooths things out. Hints of milk chocolate, oatmeal, licorice, hazelnut and subtle hops with a dry finish.

'Best-by' date and ABV printed on the label of the bottle. Lacing all along the insides of the glass as the head dissipated. Almost pitch black in color with deep ruby red highlights along the bottom of the glass. Caramel, toffee, roasted malts with hints of coffee and bitter chocolate make up for the aroma. Taste upfront is high on the roasted malts with a nice mix of dark chocolate, coffee and a bitter finish from the hops which go almost unnoticed for the most part. This is a delicious porter. Nice, silky, smooth porter which coats the palate perfectly with every sip. The low ABV and the smoothness make this a very drinkable brew and a very good sessions beer.

Black like the storms that sunk the Edmund Fitzgerald, this beer give a little when held right up to the light, mostly shot through with red if you do. The head is a gorgeous tan affair; towering, fine, and lacing in clumps.  The nose is strong on powdered hot chocolate with soft roast notes. Coffee with creamer just adds to the smooth luster and a little anise spices it up.  Melted milk chocolate slips away to give you creamy espresso on the back. Slight acidity from a moderate-high level of roast emulates that found in espresso. A very rich beer without being overbearing.  Eminently creamy mouthfeel to pair with the rich flavors and aromas. Really quite like coffee with cream.  I usually like a hop presence in Porters, but this does rich chocolate and coffee so well I hardly notice its absence. Very smooth and a rich treat, possibly for the times you don't need or want to pull out the high octane Stouts.

Rich, creamy, smooth looking tan head with tremendous retention and full lacing. The head settled to an attractive film across the top.  Smell - A nose of bitter chocolate and toastiness. Some roasted coffee and mocha seemed to be balanced near perfectly with chocolate hints. Not the strongest smelling Porter I have ever encountered, but impressive none the less.  Taste - A heaping portion of chocolate slaps the taste buds while the roasted coffee mellows out the sweetness. Somewhat bitter, but in an oh so balanced and pleasing way. I don't see how many Porters could taste better than this. I think I'm in love with this taste.  Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel. Silky, smooth and dry. Somewhat oily and blankets the tongue, throat and roof of the mouth with plenty of flavor.  Drinkability - This is a great Porter. One that I'm going to try again and again. Very easy to drink and very pleasing to the eyes and taste buds. Can't wait to pick this up again. A real excellent experience when sipping on a cold night.

73,226,brown2cu,4.14,"Appearance is that of a typical porter. It pours jet black with a wicked beige head that leaves behind an ample amount of lace while the head dies down a bit into a nice thick froth.  The smell on this one is incredible, and leaves little to be desired. a lot of chocolate hits the nostrils as well as bitter espresso. Some malt sweetness is discernible as well as some faint earthy tones. This is by far the best porter I have ever smelled, thus far.  The taste is not quite up to par here. It is a little thin and watery and places and, I feel that the hop bitterness is a little cloying and inhibits the other flavors. Other than the hops, there is a strong dark chocolate flavor that adds to the bitterness but manages to impart some typical sweetness into the taste.  The mouth feel is good, plenty of carbonation here.  Drinkability is excellent for this brew. Due to the ABV being relatively tame it has all the characteristics for a session beer. The taste is pretty inoffensive and allows for this beer to be easy to partake in.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Heavy roasted grains, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and slight caramel.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, lower carbonation.  Drinkability - A very good beer.

73,226,Khazadum,3.92,"Blind beer marked #7. As written, I poured this one into a pint glass for instant consumption and review. As it is Friday night, I'll try to do a minimalist approach.  Vision Outrageous head formation. This is carbonated to a point that it requires a gentle pour. The retention and volume on this sandy cap amaze me. Body has ruby edging with amber body. Very few streams of carbonation arise from the base. The lacing is... slippery. It appears interesting, but slithers down the sides leaving you wanting.  Bouquet Campfire smoke again! This is my favorite aroma lately. I don't know why, but I can't get enough out of it. Could be the cold weather, though. Some burnt grains, and maybe oak... although the oak appeared after five deep inhales.  Flavor Profile Opens burnt flavors. Cardboard a tad. Sweet malty middle. Finishes roasted flavors of grains and campfire smoke. Reminds me of picking off chucks of my toast and eating it separately.  Mouth Crisp and bubbly. Lingers delightfully on the finish with flavors I'm falling in love with. Mild, thinnish body.  Conclusions What a spot on porter. I'm thinking this is an American one. Not strong enough in terms of alcohol or flavors to be any other kind. It is sessionable, which excites me for a Friday night. I'd like another one of these. I think I know the style enough to even grade this now.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Bouleboubier,4.5,"I wouldn't doubt that I'll be back at some point to raise my marks and enhance my praise for this beer. Ranks up with Anchor Porter as one of the most dumbfoundingly phenomenal domestic porters.  Basically, it's coal black and the head pours with a tremendous swell - mousse creamy - leaving a thick collar and swirl while lacing nicely. Huge chocolate aroma with a smooth, rounded bitterness - densely malty. Like the Anchor, this features not a trace of that subtle sour tang in the taste that may be characteristic of many porters, nor does it lend any apparent fruity or hoppy flavors. What it does have is thick, malty chocolate out the ass. I'm not even sure there's any roasted tones to it. A bit of light toasted grain throughout. But surely bittersweet chocolate at its core with some (roasty? hoppy?) bitter and light sweet coffee in the finish. Maybe some caramel qualities in the middle as well. Just a wonderful, supremely-balanced recipe all-around. With each sip, it coats not only your mouth, but your entire innards as it goes down. I want to say it's heavy, but that could be the thick concentration of its malts playing on my senses. It honestly drinks deceptively moderately light.  Can't help second guessing myself when I suggest this is ""almost"" perfect (on every point). Could it be just a little creamier please? Needlessly nitpicking at this point. I would by a sixer, nay, a CASE of this in a heartbeat.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,machostacos,4.44,"Poured from 12oz glass into pint glass.  A: Rich, rich, rich dark nearly-black with lovely ruby highlights and a one-finger light brown head. Decent lacing.  S: Rich, roasty malts: chocolate, smooth dark roasted coffee, licorice, with an unexpectedly fresh, pine and citrus hop aroma which offsets the rich maltiness exquisitely.  T: A perfect replica of the nose: rich, roasty bittersweet chocolate and coffee with a touch of licorice and that fresh piney resinous hop character with that lovely kiss of citrus that compliments the bittersweet roasty chocolate & coffee flavor perfectly. Great balance.  M: Honestly, a little watery. A little more heft and this would be porter perfection in a bottle.  D: Right up there with Founders Porter & Anchor Porter (so far my top two porters by a fairly wide margin), and definitely one that I will pick up again.

73,226,bbb099,3.91,"Appearance - Lots of head upon pouring and retain quite a bit of foam. Moderate lacing. Dark, raisin-colored.  Smell - Strong roasted malt scent.  Taste - Straight up classic porter with a very subtle chocolate and coffee flavor. Solid overall.  Mouthfeel - Ample carbonation. Perfect for the style of beer,  Drinkability - A little on the thick side. It would go well with a hearty meal such as steak or ham.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,JLeege,4.35,"Appearance- Poured into a fluted glass, dark brown, approaching black, with a tan 2 finger head. Good head retention, a little lacing left down the glass.  Smell- Coffee, bittersweet chocolate, some earthy hops.  Taste- Very well balanced blend of roasted and toasted malts. Notes of chocolate and coffee, a slight hop presence towards the back end, more of the piney variety. Slightly bitter coffee finish, but not overlly dry.  Mouthfeel- Full bodied, medium carbonation. Very smooth.  Overall- Great porter, is it really one of the best in the world... maybe. But the price point for a beer of this calliber is excellent. This beer does not dissapoint, especially for 9 bucks a six pack!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,mjyoung,4.27,"12oz bottle split with bbb099  A: It poured nice and dark with a medium head. There is little-to-no lacing, but it does retain a fair bit of foam.  S: A strong smell of roasted coffee with an undercurrent of rich malted chocolate. Very enticing.  T: A classic porter, it hits all of the notes from a solid first taste to a great finish. The coffee and chocolate notes follow the smell quite cleanly. It provides all of the flavor it promises, but it completely avoids the possibility of harsh.  M: Medium thickness, but it does leave a pleasantly cloying aftertaste. Not lip-smacking good, but close.  D: Very drinkable. This is a very solid porter but it doesn't overpower the tastebuds. This would leave me coming back for more.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,musicforairports,4.54,"12oz bottle best by 7 May 2011, drank on 13 December 2010. This guys is pretty fresh.  Pours very dark brown, small brown head that leaves some lacing.  Smells like chocolate and coffee, neither sweet nor bitter.  Tastes smooth. Wow. This harnesses all the flavors a porter should have and puts them all out there with none smacking you in the face. Tastes quite a bit like chocolate, less coffee than some porters. Mild burnt taste. Again, not sweet and not bitter. Mellow but flavorful, if thats possible.  Mouthfeel is the fuller side of medium. Not too creamy, but not watery at all.  I wish this were sold where I live.

No visible carbonation.  S-- Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. Chocolate is dark and rich. Coffee and malts were a little thin.  T-- Coffee, chocolate and a little bit of lemon bitterness.  M-- Coffee and chocolate feel with the lemon being in the middle of the palate. Lower medium carbonation and a big robust feel. Bitter coffee finish.  D-- Easy to drink and a nice porter. Quite complex and well balanced. Easy to have two of these. A beer I would drink in the summer pretty easily.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Swedes21,4.2,"12 fl oz served in a chilled glass  Appearance - beer pours a dark black colour that does reflect some light. The beer has a light brown head that is fairly full in appearance. It is hard to tell the carbonation levels. Their is some nice lacing occurring.  Smell - picking up some dark tones, coffee, chocolate and caramel are my thoughts. There is a decent malt smell as well to this beer.  Taste - What a punch of taste! This beer has a solid coffee bean taste followed with a very lasting bitterness. I find the chocolate comes through more than the caramel, but a very well balanced beer.  Mouthfeel - not a tremendous amount of carbonation added, however, the mouthfeel increases the bitterness and coffee taste.  Drinkability - Nice tasting beer, i am not a massive fan of these yet tend to enjoy the odd one. This is totally not a session beer for me, but a good treat!  Special thanks out to spinrsx for the Great Lakes trade, you've made me a fan!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,KickInTheChalice,4.67,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Black mixed with walnut brown color with a ruby tint, not really much light escaping through here. A nice creamy tan head forms with the pour. The lace lingers a few centimeters above the beer level and inches its way down.  Smell: Milk chocolate, caramel, and roasted coffee dominate the nose.  Taste: The milk creamy sweetness starts out the flavor by combining sweet caramel, a latte like espresso flavor, and some roasted malt. A kick of spice and herbal hops impart a light hoppy bite. The finish keeps a good part of the coffee, cream, and herbal hop flavors.  Mouthfeel: Creamy smoothness and carbonation with a full body. Although the start is very creamy, the feel becomes more dry toward the end.  Drinkability: I found this to be a very drinkable porter. Great Lakes has some very good offerings, and this falls in their category of well-done, medium ABV, drinkable beers with some character.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,drumrboy22,4.3,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Cigar City snifter.  Beer was a dark, cola brown color, with a sandy colored, one-finger head.  Light carbonation and moderate lacing around the glass.  Aroma was burnt wood, licorice, caramel, a touch of hops and coffee.  Taste was roasted grains, chocolate, caramel, coffee and bitter hops.  Long bitter finish.   Delicious beer.  Fairly rich, but highly drinkable. I'd seek this out again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,acurtis,4.25,"Had a mini Porter tasting, first off: Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. Dark with ruby highlights shining through. Nice tan head, faded away quickly, sticking to the glass. Mild aroma of carmel, roasted malt, chocolate. Aroma and taste got better after a few extra minutes of warming. Taste is smooth and exceptional. Not as thick and heavy as Founders but just as tasty. Roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and hops. Very carbonated and light on the tongue. High drinkability and tasty porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,surlytheduff,4.25,"Drank from a Sam Adams perfect pint. Beer poured a deep dark brown, with a finger of head. Smelled of rich roasted malts, some chocolate, vanilla and a little bit of coffee.  The taste was a as robust as the smell indicated. It was somewhat bitter and smokey, but overall the sweet chocolatey malts balanced things out. It was medium bodied, creamy and maybe a bit too carbonated. Very drinkable, especially when you factor in the low ABV. Three thumbs up!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,kochea7,3.22,"A-Poured a good head that lasted awhile. Quite dark with black hints. S-Hops, clearly American hops used in this brew. T-Overly hoppy and bitter at first, fades to some maltyness, but back to bitter aftertaste. M-Wasn't too watery and wasn't like pudding. A good thickness for a porter. D-Its very drinkable if you like a rather hop dominated porter, with little malt tones.  I feel it would have been much better had they used a British hops like Fuggles instead of the American, probably Cascade. I personally prefer more maltyness in my porters and less bitterness.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Huhzubendah,4.38,"On draft at Churchkey in D.C.  A: Very dark brown with a thick inch of beige head. The retention is excellent and the glass is coated with sticky lacing.  S: Roast, chocolate. The aroma is more subtle than the taste.  T: Wow. This beer is fantastic. Rich and roasty with delicious chocolates.  M: Great feel. Medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Chocolates linger in the finish.  D: I could easily throw back several of these.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ColdPoncho,4.8,"First ever growler for me. Moderately exciting.  A - It's not opaque, but it's got a really beautiful deep red/brown color with head that never goes away and some of the nicest lacing I've seen from a not very hoppy beer.  S - No messing around here, just good roasted malts and a bit of chocolate and coffee.  T - It's light and full all at the same time, sweet and dry. It's really lovely tasting. It has the malt sweetness to it that you need, but it's not a sugar bomb. It's like toasted coffee bread in a glass...or something. Basically, this is the best porter I've ever had and can possibly imagine.  M - Fine feeling beer. Not too heavy, not particularly smooth or creamy, though. It's fine, but nothing to write home about.  D - Well, I'm almost done with this growler, and kind of wish i had more. Under 6% ABV, tasty, not too heavy. It's really fantastic. This beer stands the test of time. From the first time I sipped it to now, this remains one of my favorite beers and by being nearly perfect in every way, it holds up to every beer I've ever had.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is comprised of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and caramel. The flavor is of roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, and slight cream. It has a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this is just what I needed after a night filled with mediocre beer. This one is truly excellent. I really wasn't expecting much going into this one, but it definitely has surprised me. Nicely balanced flavor and aroma going on in this one.

73,226,DaveBlack,4.55,"A: Very dark brown, almost black, with a slight reddish tint at the edges. Has maybe 1/2 inch of tan head which stays around for a little while before fading away and leaving a nice ring of lacing.  S: All porter: lots of coffee, a slight hint of smoke. and a deep roasty malt aroma.  T: Tastes like it smells: coffee, slight smoky flavor, reminiscent of oaked beers, sweet chocolate malts. Hits the palate bitter at first, which gives way to a nice balancing sweetness. The aftertaste, however, is bitter again.  M: Full bodied and robust, with more carbonation than I usually expect from porters. To me it doesn't feel as heavy as it tastes, which is kind of nice.  D: A really good beer, a great representation of porters. Not surprising from Great Lakes, in my experience they make all their beers really, really well. Definitely worth checking out.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Lolli1315,4.13,"A- An almost opaque black color with a finger of tan bubbly head thats sticks around quite nicely. Decent lacing sticks to the glass walls as well.  S- Roasted coffee and some traces of dark chocolate, but certainly overpowered by the roasted malt smells. Small traces of sweetness as the end of the beer progresses into a slight bitterness while a small amount of alcohol become noticeable as the beer finishes.  T- Smooth dark chocolate with notes of espresso and coffee while caramel lingers in the background. Hops become noticeable about halfway through the beer and hold steady until the end. The hops compliment the bitter chocolate as the beer finishes into a burnt coffee grind flavor with roasted malts.  M- Medium body with a very smooth finish.

It pours a rich chocolate creamy dark brown, with a quarter inch tan head that sticks around. Smells like chocolate, malts, and a bit of smoke. Really sweet. When you sip it, there are definitely notes of rich coffee, caramel, and at some point a bit of a tart fruity sweetness. Mostly dark and rich though. It's body makes sure it's certainly not the thickest porter, but at this abv point, Great Lakes has made a heck of a drinkable beer. Plus with the great carbonation, you don't really mind the sometimes watery feel to it.  This is a heck of a porter. Helped my balance, too.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,kbanks13,4.62,"Got this as an extra in a trade with UMNbeerhunter, thanks again Joe!  Poured into a pint glass with a dark brown body with light brown edges when held to the light. Two finger frothy khaki-colored head that has very good retention and leaves good lacing on the glass. Smells of coffee, chocolate, molasses and some spice. Taste is a great balance of cream, coffee, chocolate, and brown sugar. Not overly sweet, bitter, or roasted, just right in every flavor. Light body due to medium to high carbonation but still something I can chew on. Great beer in every aspect, and it could go well with any meal or situation. Would have no trouble convincing myself to keep this on hand.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,beerdown77,4.38,"This poured black with two fingers of brown head. This was more drinkable than the Gonzo, but it is a little less strong, so maybe plays into it a little bit. This is the coffee variety, as opposed to being more chocolaty. For a porter, this is very crisp and carbonated. When I toured The Great Lakes Brewery in 2008, the tour guide told me this was his favorite all-year-round beer. I don't know if this is my favorite beer, but I could easily drink this any time of the year. Great beer!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Boppar,4.68,"From a bottle poured into a pint glass at Tria.  A: Dark, dark brown. One finger of rapidly fading head and some lacing afterwards.  s: Sweet biscuits, brown sugar, earthy hops.  T: Opens with sweet malts, toffee, and brown sugar. There is a pronounced coffee and chocolate presence mid-palate that is very nicely presented. The chocolate is robust without being over the top or cloying, and the coffee is well-balanced and rich without tasting burnt as it so often does in a porter. The finish is earthy and slightly bitter: peat and moss after a rain come to mind.  M: The mouthfeel is not too thick the way it is with other porters which try to hard to be stouts. It goes down slick and smooth, with a silky slight weight to it.  D: Exceptionally smooth and rich, but approachable enough to be a session beer. Truly world class.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,BuckeyeSlim,3.98,"12 oz. bottle poured into a New Belgium snifter.  A - 1-finger head that's a light tan pillow of fine foam. Dissipates rather slowly, leaving a solid film ringed on the glass. Dark chocolate brown and quite opaque.  S - Hops jump right up into the nose. As it warms in the glass, freshly-ground medium roast coffee with a touch of well-done caramel and toffee emerge.  T - Dark 75% chocolate right up front accompanied by morning roast coffee and malt, followed by roasted nut mix on the sides of the tongue. Bittering hops push most of that aside and take over for the finish.  M - Medium carbonation, neither creamy or fizzy. Decent structure. Body tastes a tad thin for the style and level of roasting. Finish really cleans off the palate, leaving it on the dry side.  D - With the trend of American porters being hopped-up almost-stouts in disguise, this is a good example of that, especially with all the hops in the finish. That's fine if that's what you're looking for, but I like to see less roasting and sweeter/maltier tastes throughout with only enough hops for balance in my porters. Even so, I could drink two or three of these and be happy.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BuckyFresh,4.3,"Appearance: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large wine glass. Pours a dark brown, with a tan two-finger head. When held up to the light, this beer has some pretty cool blood-red/ruby color that finds its way through the glass. Head retention and lacing are very good.  Smell: Very pungent, nutty, roasted malt aroma, with coffee, chocolate, and molasses notes. The smell is incredibly deep and rich; really makes you want to dive right in!  Taste: A bit lighter in texture than the smell leads on. There's much more smokiness present in the taste as well. While there is a good malt punch in this beer, the bitter coffee and chocolate are aligned perfectly in opposition, leaving the drinker with an epic battle of deliciousness waged on the palate.  Mouthfeel: For a beer with this much flavor, the mouthfeel remains crisp and refreshing. The finish is slightly dry, but clean, and the texture is light enough to enjoy without feeling overwhelmed.  Drinkability: Very drinkable indeed. A nice alternative to heavier beers when you aren't willing to sacrifice on flavor.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ewright,4.21,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. A half-inch of beige head forms from a moderately aggressive pour and slowly recedes to a thin ring accented by small islands of foam in the middle. The beer is extremely dark brown, with just a hint of lighter brown at the edges. Spots of foam cling to the glass after a sip, but it's not what I would call lacing.  Dark roasted grain aroma is dominant. No hop characteristics in the nose, as befits the style. It smells particularly tasty, but I'm not getting any specific aromas... maybe just a faint hint of leather. How confusing!  The taste is outstanding. Exactly what you expect from a porter. Full of dark roast coffee with faint smoky notes. Sufficient hop bitterness to balance it out, but no overwhelming hop flavors that would be out of place in a porter. Big bold flavor in this one.  Moderately thick on the tongue, but a clean aftertaste. This is a great drinking beer and an excellent expression of the American porter style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S: Chocolatey with a scent of roasted barley malt and a touch of coffee.  T: Charcoal bitterness over roasted barley. Chocolatey-sweetness undercurrent. Finishes with lingering bitterness.  M: Feels slightly thin for the style. Call it slightly lighter than medium-bodied, good creaminess.  D: Good. Nice porter flavors and pretty easily drinkable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,WholeFoodsDerek,4.4,"A - Very Dark Brown to Jet black. Good Head retention for a porter with a cream color. Good.  S - Malts, Coffee, Chocolate, subtle expresso.  T - I usually drink imperial porters, but this was outstanding for a regular porter. Lots of complexity and depth considering the low ABV (for me). Nice balance of hops and malts, yet exceptionally creamy. Vanilla and subtle Creme Brulee flavors come to mind. I get lots of toasted malts in the finish.  M - Very creamy for a porter. Full bodied, bold, and Dark. Great.  D - Exceptional! I could have a few of these.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Dark chocolate that is at first sweet, then finishes slightly bitter; very deep, full, and rich, yet remarkably balanced. Accented all the way by dark fruit tastes, something like figs or dates.  M- Smooth and luxurious, yet restrained at the same time. This is like velvet for the mouth, but the hops clean it all up well. Full-bodied.  D- 5.8% makes it perfect for anything, such a lovely drinking experience! My favorite beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Chocolate totally defines the nose. Underneath getting some toffe, but dark chocolate really defines things here. Very, very nice.  Roasted malt flavor in the hit, with lots of rich dark chocolate following. Slightly hoppy in the finish, but lots of bitters from the cocoa flavors. Outstanding.  Feel is much thicker than other American or English porters. Coats the tongue with a rich profile of chocolates. My Irish wife, when she drinks beer, drinks little but the trad dark stuff - but she likes this!  At just under 6%, I could drink this all night.

An excellent smelling beer.  T- Much like the smell. Very good. Roasted, malty flavor. Hints of chocolate.  M- Light to medium mouthfeel. The smoothness is almost like drinking milk. Little drying as a porter is.  D- This might be the best aspect of this beer. Low enough abv, great taste, nice and smooth.

73,226,BeerAdvocate,4.2,"Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #32 (Sep 2009):  Brewed in memory of the sunken freighter Edmund Fitzgerald.  Nearly all the way black with some ruby highlights. Smells of one of those $5 iced chocolaty espresso concoctions. Rolling smoothness adds to the drinkability. Medium, chewy body with rich tones of caramels, creamed coffee and dark chocolate. Hops keep an even keel with the malt, yet never become too sharp, with an herbal flavor that fades to citrus. Dry, chocolate-cookie finish.  It's a split decision whether it would go better with a rich German chocolate cake or a crock of braised short ribs; either way, this is one choice American Porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,EricHeff,4.62,"Pours very dark with a little bit of head that lingers on the side throughout the drink. It smells FANTASTIC with hints of chocolate and coffee. It smells just like a fantastic dessert. The taste is just as good. The smell is stronger than the taste of chocolate and coffee, but by golly it is a perfect fit with this porter. This is one of my all time favorite beers. You may call me biased because I am from Cleveland, but Great Lakes Brewing Company is one of the best out there. They know how to brew amazing beers.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jdflyer06,3.73,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: Very dark, even when held to the light with a faint ruby hue. The Head is frothy and hangs around for a bit leaving a small bit of lacing as it goes down.  S: Smoky, somewhat metallic nose. Coffee is very pronounced throughout with a bit of smoked peat and oak.  M: Smooth, creamy and very rich for a porter. Has the mouthfeel of a stout but finishes clean. Alcohol is well hidden although it cuts through the palate at the finish.  T: Malty backbone with a slight smoky character, much like the nose. Somewhat watered down and I can't pick up much at first. Faint espresso character as it warms. Not overly complex.  O: A good straightforward porter, although I'm not as impressed with it as others. The drinkibiliy is pretty high on this one as the balance is perfect. It's not a session beer by any means, but it's as close as you'll come to sessioning a porter.

73,226,JohnnyChicago,4.35,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tumbler.  A: Pours a near black with a nice two-finger off-white head.  S: Smell is roasted barley and coffee.  T: Coffee and malts with a hint of hops and an earthy toffee aftertaste.  D: Extremely quaffable! Its full of flavour, but the flavour is always subtle and never overwhelming.  Overall: Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. Its the definitive American porter. Smooth, creamy, tasty and sessionable. Its a little beer with a big personality that gives its bigger stout and imperial porter brothers a run for their money in the flavour department.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ktrillionaire,4.24,"Thanks to Bobby8405 for the share.  A - Deeper than cola, capped with a wispy tan head and leaving small streaks of lace.  S - Sweet barley is available in the nose, complemented by a green leafy and herbal hop. The malt is somewhat caramelized and fairly pale in flavor. There are minor roasted characteristics, but not too much...  T - Lighter tasting. Paradoxically, it is neither sweet nor dry. Fairly hoppy, and not too far off of the emerging CDA style. The elements of the nose are basically re-stated; lightly caramelized and roasty malt, green hop. I don't know about this being the greatest Porter, but it is definitely good...  M - It feels more 'wet' than a usual Porter. This beer is quite refreshing regardless of style, and hugely so for a Porter.  D - This is so drinkable, that it is slam-able. About as easy drinking as it gets.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,chicano4craft,4.55,"An aggressive pour brings two fingers of tan, bubbley head. Dark brown, nearly black with some ruby highlights around the edge of the glass. Nice.  Nose is chocolate and coffee. Somewhat sweet with a little bit of roasted malt in the back.  Taste is amazing. The chocalate and coffee are up front with a slight bitter dryness in the end.

73,226,lstokes,3.96,"This is a beautiful beer, very dark brown, nearly black with spectacular lacing, but I was disappointed by the nose, which is a little bit too burnt and doesn't really show off the more complex flavors of the beer. It starts sweet and roasty with some cinnamon and then moves into chocolate, finishing with a lot of coffee and some nice yeasty sourness.  This is a beer that I liked more as I was drinking it and appreciating its subtlety. I also dig the very creamy mouthfeel, and highly drinkable.

Kind of like raw malts. This beer has an incredible smell. A hint of coffee and chocolate.  Taste: An articulation of its smell, raw dark malts with coffee and dark chocolate. There is also a bitterness that lingers on the tongue, kind of like the aftertaste of coffee and sugar.  Drinkability: Best porter I've ever had.

Aroma is one of roasted coffee notes with some choclate and toffee. Taste has a nice smokiness to it yet still preserves the holy coffee/toffee/chocolate trifecta from the smell. As the beer warms, the burnt black malts become more pronounced, adding to the complexity of this amazing porter. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, although not too dense for the style, making it a pleasure to drink.

73,226,JoEBoBpr,4.22,Poured into a pint glass.  A - Pours a nice medium-dark brown with some great reddish hues. There is a nice .25 in head that forms that is light tan and has some nice retention. It recedes down to a thin film and has some nice sticky lacing to it.  S - Nice roasted coffee notes that are intermingled with some great coffee notes as well. The roasted malt aromas are quite strong but very delicious and quite rich. There is some nice notes of vanilla and spice as well on the nose.  T & M - Starts off with some great smokey flavors as well as some notes of very well roasted coffee. Flavor is rich but the body could use a bit more viscosity and fullness. A bit on the light side for my taste and for this I enjoy Founders Porter a bit better. Still flavors are overall well done with great smokiness and nice roasted character. It is one of the smokiest of the American Porters that I've had. On the back end of the beer there is a slight grassy hop bitterness that gives a nice clean dry finish.  D - Drinkability is good on this brew with lower ABV that is manageable and good flavors. I can see how the smokiness might tire out the taste buds though.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

T - roasted coffee, dark chocalate with a nice sweet licorice finish, a littley fruity too but i can point out exactly what? maybe blackberries. leaves a dry hoppy aftertaste as it warms.

M- Thick, creamy and chewy all at the same time...is that even possible?? Coats the throat with cough syrup-like addictiveness.  D/O- One delicious beer.

73,226,nhindian,4.1,"12oz bottle poured into a Perfect Pint  A - Pours a dark brown, nearly black steady stream. Can see some traces of brown around the edges but the middle of the body is flat black. Builds around a 1.5 fingered-head that reduces to a cap in a few minutes. Minimal amount of lacing left from the head as I drink.  S - Nose is of light, roasted coffee mixed with some bittersweet cocoa. Definitely get some toasted barley and some earthy tones to really add to the depth of this beer. Just get a hint of alcohol creeping from behind the rest.  T - The taste is predominantly chocolate with a rush of coffee in the aftertaste. Not overwhelming in the least and goes down quite easily. Sneaking in the back is some bitter hops, but are quickly balanced by the malts and alcohol. Alcohol is present but doesn't distract or hinder. After the alcohol and bitterness fades away, it leaves a bit of a watery taste in the mouth.  M - For such a dark beer, it is actually fairly light. Not very thick and the pleasant taste doesn't need to be chewed through. Even with the blackness, I can still see a steady stream of carbonation that feels good on the palate.  D - A very easy to drink beer and could easily be a gateway into the more robust beers and styles. A great flavor and light feel has me drinking this beer a bit faster than I have anticipated and it's a good thing that Great Lakes delivers these in 6-packs as this could easily be drank for an entire evening.

T: Very smoky taste not shown in the smell. Great overall, a flutter of oak and roasted malt, sweet and tart of dried dark fruit. Some bitter chocolate in there too. Very good, well balanced taste overall especially for a 5.8% beer.  M: spikey carbonation, but still smooth and nicely medium in body and roasty.  D: Very good porter, totally solid.

S-Smells of roasted malts, a little vanilla, a hint of some nutty aromas with a clean hop nose.  T-Nutty and roasty malt upfront with a sweet chocolate middle and a dry, bitter dark chocolate finish.  M-Thick side of medium bodied with low to medium carbonation and a pretty slick smooth feel.  D-Wow, revisiting Edmund was a great idea. I've had it in bottles countless times and on-tap (think it had been on-tap a little too long)once but all those times never really impressed me that much.

73,226,RRC87,4.08,"A: Pours a dark coffee brown (almost black), with a creamy light than head that rapidly diminishes to thin wisps of bubbles; yet, it leaves the sides of the glass completely covered where the head once was.  S: Smells of sweet chocolate backed up by bitter roast coffee notes.  T: Tastes of dark chocolate and coffee goodness. There is a great deal of roasted malt sweetness. This is prevented from becoming overpowering by the hop bitterness that reveals its' self on the back end.  M: Medium to light for the style with a good deal of carbonation that bites at the back of the throat (in a good way).  D: Goes down easily. Between the carbonation and the lingering bitterness it leaves you constantly wanting more.  Overall: A very solid beer.

73,226,Buggabeer,3.3,Poured from bottle into 16oz glass. A. Nice dark Brown with a reddish hint when held to the light. A fast pour produced a two finger head which after a couple of drinks vanishes to a thin coating on top of the beer. I laces very nice on the side of the glass.  S. Is good I can pick up a toasted smell to the malt and coffee under tones.  T. The taste is average to me. I'm not a big fan of the toasted after taste. It's as if they burnt the grains. I wish there was a little more coffee taste than what there is. The coffee flavor is over powered by the toasted (I think more like burnt grains)  M. I can't seem to get that burnt tast out of my mouth. I goes into the mouth very nice but that finish is to much for me.  D. I find this to be a very average Porter. I wouldn't like another after this one. That flavor of burnt grains or burnt coffee just isn't doing it for me.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,scottfrie,4.03,"12oz bottle into snifter.  A: A deliberately rough pour yielded a huge light tan head that slowly faded into a thick dense layer that looked like melted ice-cream and lasted forever. The head left rings of sticky lacing down the glass over the extremely dark, almost black, liquid. S: Smells of creamy vanilla-chocolate swirl ice-cream. Slight notes of roasted coffee. This definitely blurs the line between porter and stout. T: Follows the nose with a big roasted malt and light coffee and chocolate taste. A touch of leafy hops come out in the finish and add a touch of bitterness. M: Extremely smooth mouthfeel with fairly creamy carbonation over a medium-low body. D: One of the best porters I've had, but I dare say that I still think that Black Butte Porter has an edge over this one. I know the line between stouts and porters is almost nonexistent, but this tastes more like a weak stout while BBP has more of that fruity, spicy character.

The carbonation is pretty apparent throughout.  Aroma: Chocolate fudge, smoked malt, and some toffee undertones here. Strong, but nicely balanced with a good nix of sweet and smoky.  Taste: The smoke notes here are really assertive and definitely give the feel of a traditional porter. Chocolate and some light espresso notes are also here strong. Some nice caramel and toffee to balance out the flavors in the back. A really flavorful and nice porter.  Mouthfeel: Pretty heavily carbonated for a porter. Medium body and crisp.  Drinkability: The ABV is well hidden and the flavors are strong but balanced. I could definitely have more than one, but I'm not thinking it sessionable.

There is some sweetness, but exactly the right amount. Finish is bitter, dry, and a bit herbal.  M - has a creamy feel that coats the mouth, but the finish is slightly dry. Very nice. Carbonation level is what I would expect.  D - I can never get enough. This beer goes down smooth for easy drinking.  This is, in my humble opinion, the porter by which all other American porters should be judged. It's that good, and it's a perfect representation of the style.

Smelled far too strong at first, and then became more of a relaxed subtle aroma.  T- Coffee and cocoa from the start. Roasted malts are not only a strong foundation to this drink, but they come to the top of the taste as well. Has a ton of sweetness and bitterness from the beginning but the bitterness wins out barely. The aftertaste is glorious. Roasted malt and espresso.  M- A heavier bodied stout, especially for a 5.8%. It's just so creamy and smooth that it's a bit hard to notice. They couldn't easily make the mouthfeel much better. Slightly sticky dry finish.  D- A very easy to drink stout, and full of flavor at the same time. Balanced almost too perfection. I love this stout and found it to be an acquired taste.

73,226,Riccymon,4.5,"I obtained a six pack of Edmund Fitz about a year ago, and I've been saving my last bottle for months now. A good porter sounded right, so I cracked it-- Best by March 2010.  Pours from the bottle a rather clear, chestnut brown color with a good finger and a half of off-white head. Lacing extends around much of the glass, and we're off to a great start. A little skin of head remains atop old Edmund, also playing to his advantage.  The nose on Edmund Fitz is almost woody, a deep rich aroma. Swirling also has me smelling chocolate syrup, earthy, nutty flavors. Also, I often pick up cola-like aromas and flavors from porters, and the best of this characteristic is present in this beer. Sipping further brings forth flavors from the nose, but a heretofore unrevealed hop presence cuts through the sweet malt to really make this porter stand out from the crowd.  The mouthfeel from this beer is smooth and lightly carbonated. The hop bittering leaves a dry, clean finish, and tops off an extremely well-polished beer. All of the above factors leave me wanting more of this drinkable, drinkable beer.

The head is light tan and has pretty decent staying power, leaving nice lace on the sides of the pint.  The aroma is very roasty and pleasant. It smells like dark roast coffee beans with just a hint of cocoa and some molasses. Mostly that dark roastyness takes over the aroma.  The flavor is wonderful with a very nice balance to it. Roasty malts with flavors of coffee and a bit of chocolate. Nutty flavors, caramel, toffee, molasses, a hint of pine and even some vanilla combine to make a wonderful taste profile. It has a very pleasant malty sweetness that perfectly mirrors the roasty bitterness. Very clean tasting and well done.  The mouthfeel is silky smooth with a medium body and a carbonation that is spot on. The finish is effortless and coats the mouth without getting too sticky. Sweet malt and bitter roasted barley are the dominate aftertastes.  Super drinkable and a wonderful example of the style.

Smell is of good coffee grounds most heavily. Other aromas include oak and faint burnt cocoa notes. Caramel and Butterscotch notes also entertain the nostrils. The taste is of weak coffee, char and caramel. In spite of the burnt notes that are apparent throughout there is a subtle sweetness that comes from the caramel notes and turns out to be quite pleasant. The feel of this beer is a bit watery for my liking. It's not really all that bad, but it feels with the flavors that it should be a little more viscous. The carbonation is pretty good.

Looks dark and thicker than most of the style. 3.5  Smell of chocolate, hops, and burnt malt. Really a good combo.  Dark chocolate, burnt malt, all in a pretty hoppy porter. This beer is amazing. The sweetness from the malt is so amazingly balanced by hops and chocolate bitterness.  This beer feels thicker than it is. It has great carbonation that creates a creamy body and lets you enjoy just sipping it.  As great as it is to sip this work of art, it also is really drinkable. No alcohol effect and at 5.5% that's what should happen. It's just amazing how you could drink 4-5 of these or just savor one over the course of a night.

Somewhat smokey with a metallic tinge, but the metallic notes seems to be fading. Smells pretty good, but it would be nice if it were a bit stronger.  Roasty, smoked dark malts wash across the tongue followed by some bitter hop and a touch of dark chocolate. Still some what metallic and thin. A little more bitter than I would like. Almost grainy.  Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, but seems a bit thin and over carbonated.  Drinkability is better than average, but not great. I'm not really sure why this beer gets so much love. Founders Porter blows this one out of the water as does Sierra Nevada's offering. Too bitter and thin with a faint (yet noticeable) metallic taste. Maybe this is just a bad bottle.

A bit of coca powder and vanilla surfaces with suggestions of malted milk and roasted barley. A strong presence of bittering hops leads the way to earthy wood tones. Bitter and dry on the back end.

There's a lot of chocolate up front, then some nice toasted malt, and the finish is of maple syrup.  T: Lots of malt, graham cracker, oat, and some chocolate. This beer surprised me in the depth of flavor and complexity it has. A very, very tasty beer.  M: Appropriate for the style, although, I think this would be even better if it were a bit more viscous. Nice level of carbonation.  D: Excellent drinkability. This is tasty, complex, and the alcohol is completely hidden. I would drink this again and again.

Slight smoke aromas hid in the background, but are not dominant.  The body is full and thick. Those roasted malt aromas become the dominant flavors in the flavor profile. Coffee and bittersweet chocolate are very forward. I also detected a pleasant flavor of bourbon and warming alcohol.

When held up to a light I can barely see through it. Good head rentention, very good actually and excellent lacing. Rich malts provide a complex aroma. I can pick out cofee and espresso and chocolate from the roasted malts. This porter is smooth and rich in flavor, what you smell is what you get baby.

Few porters are this hoppy, but I think it's definitely a plus. Rather enjoyable. M: Medium-bodied. Coats the mouth. D: About what I expected from the style. Not too heavy, and not much alcohol.

IBUs? 12 oz bottle with a freshness date of 11/29/10 poured into a Surly pint glass on 09/16/10.  Appearance 5/5 Clear and dark brown with a nice two finger tan colored head that looks promising and leaves nice sticky lacing.  Aroma 4/5 Roasted dark malts: dark chocolate; some sweetness. Smell is not overpowering. Decent amount of hops which strike me as earthy and herbal. I expect more roast though.  Taste 4/5 First impression is nice! Rich chocolate taste, which is pleasantly surprising for a ""non-imperial"" beer of the darker kind. Starts slightly sweet on palate but hop bitterness emerges and stays until finish. The hop flavor is strong and dominates over initial chocolate. There's of course a roasted taste and feel, which is not burnt by any means. Finish is medium and bitter.  Mouthfeel 4.5/5 Low but very present carbonation seems fitting. I could've done with even less. Medium bodied, but has the finish of a higher bodied beer. Some warmth is felt, which doesn't seem out of place.  Drinkability 4.5/5 At this ABV, this is a mighty flavorful ale and I could have a few without getting drunk, which is a plus. Not cloying per se but the finish effects drinkability to some extent.  Other Probably the best porter I have had till date.

Served cold in a chilled pint glass.  Dark black brew allows only a glimmer of light through when held to a light. It generates a nice 1"" of creamy light raw umber head that leaves a thick layer of lace on the glass as it settles. Nose is a nice mix of peat, smoke, molasses, dry and sweet at the same time. Mouthfeel is moderate-heavy bodied with a crisp carbonation that cuts through to keep it from being overly thick, but it is maybe a bit too fizzy. Taste follows directly from the smell and adds a good dose of starchy raw grain, kinda like chewing on uncooked oatmeal (I mean that in a good way).

The taste is similar to the nose, a bit roasty, not very sweet. In the mouth it seems a bit fizzy to me and less than hugely full, but because of that and the attractive taste you could drink it all night.

S: Chocolate dominates with coffee in the background. Sweet roasted character throughout. Very nice.  T: Deep roasted malt backbone with characteristic astringency. Coffee is subdued and chocolate is almost nonexistent (a little disappointing). Hop bitterness is tough to make out, but there is a lingering bitter aftertaste I could do without.

73,226,NODAK,4.44,"Smells strongly of semi-sweet chocolate and roasted malts. It's an alluring smell...just smells silky.  Taste is pretty heavy on the chocolate. Rather than characterize this as a bitter chocolate like many beers of style are, this chocolate actually is somewhat milky sweet and silky at first, only later fading into a more roasted chocolate taste with some lingering bitterness.

73,226,rembrant,4.72,"looks,the right look for porter. Deep brown,a very little light comes through. Modest head with a persistant lacing up the sides.  Aroma...Oh My...rich assortment of malts,some raisin,prune sweetness,trace of smokiness,hint of a somewhat floral hops. The net effect,however,says don't sniff at it...drink it!  Deep complex flavors.Here,the hops appear in a nice harmony but let the malt blend shine. The malts have a smooth caramel going and a darker well roasted coffee smokey thing and Ed Fitz lets both appear distinctly at different moments to give a great evolving complexity of taste treats. I'd love to have a Descutes Black Butte to sample side by side as it has some similar qualities.  Note--at 50F or warmer, it's very Porter.. I since did another,chilled up to 40 something. Colder, the malt side is more subtle and the hop side and carbonation step up and it's a lot like a dark IPA. Nice trick for those hot summer days.  Ed gives you a lot of nice little surprises. There's a flavor that comes in one sip that didn't seem to be there before. It works at room temp or beersicle..and in between and nicely adapts to each.  Mouth...again, trickster. There's a full body viscosity and a wetness with just right hops and carbonation,as supporting actors. Like the flavors, the textures have some transition.  Drinkable? Uh Huh. Real drinkable. I want another one.  Always liked Porter. Back around '71 we went through cases of some unfiltered Polish Porter with faded purple labels and nothing pronouncable but the word ""Porter"" it was thick as soup,great at any temp. The Catalyst,in Santa Criuz had Anchor Porter on tap before you could find it in bottles. I had many pints there. Out west, Black Butte was awesome Porter, and now, back to the midwest, there's Edmund Fitzgerald.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Spider889,4.68,"Mmmm, one of my favorite brews by GLBC (and one of my all-time favs as well).  Poured into a DFH signature glass black with dark ruby hues. A caramel/toffee head (2-3 fingers) sits lazily atop this black delight of a beer. This beer left AMAZING lace, perhaps the best I've ever seen. A super THICK cheesecloth or Swiss cheese textured lace (if the Swiss had numerous tiny holes, not a few big ones). Did I mention how awesome the lacing was??  Smelled of chocolate malt, caramel, toasted bread, and mild hops.  The taste is of roasted malt, lots of nice subtle coffee flavors, bitter hops (just enough to add balance and assert themselves), and a mild alcohol bite on the finish.  Mouthfeel is well carbonated and medium bodied (boy do I hate a light-bodied porter), and nice and dry on the finish.  Overall drinkability is good, I can easily down two of these in a sitting, maybe three or four if I can mix things up a bit in between.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Finishes with stronger, fantastic roast biscuit caramel malt. Reminds me of a cookie in a way, some cocoa hints.  MF- Light body with lower, but very smooth carbonation. Slight bitterness.

Chocolate, coffee and I get some light blueberry notes in the background. Mouthfeel is light and almost watery. I would like it if the carbonation level was a little smaller. Pretty nice porter.

A tiny bit nutty, definite chocolate and coffee tastes, as the label suggests. Malts get better as it warms, no hops flavors at all. Nice taste overall, but rather simple.

Quite good.  Taste: rich coffee flavors with some fruit qualities up front. These remind me of hints of a Baltic porter, really; bitterness picks up toward the end as both the hops and the roast malts reassert themselves. Very good.

The taste is amazingly tame for having such a complex range. I get hints of chocolate and coffee mixed with toasted malt. The finish is very clean and slightly smokey.  This is the most drinkable and delicious porter that I have ever had. It has so much complex flavor that it is always a staple of mine, and it is easy to throw more than 2 or 3 of these back in a sitting.  This beer is a great example of a beer that is delicate and subtle in its tastes and doesn't rely on punching you in the face with massive amounts of flavors. Not that doing that is bad, it's just nice to have a balanced",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

A - Pours a dark brown with very dark ruby highlights at certain points where the light hits the glass. A slight .5 finger eggshell white color head forms and slowly dissipates to a nice eggshell white lacing.  S - Lots of roasted malts up front. Some coffee notes come through and mixes quite well with the roatsed malts. Smells like a great porter should.Some slight vanilla notes and smokey notes are there as well.  T - Roatsed malts and some sweetness up front. Roasted coffee, chocolate and vanilla also hit the middle of the palate. There is a slight smoke quality to the beer which adds nicely to the other flavors that are present. There also seems to be come slight citrus flavors present as well...perhaps some hope presence?  M - Smooth and creamy. There is a slight carbonation bite to it on the back end of the sip. Lighter to medium bodied and a nice dryness present as well.  D - Extremely drinkable.

73,226,Chaney,4.48,"I poured into a 3 Floyds pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. That's good karma already!  A: Inch thick head upon first pour. The frothy, creamy consistency stayed on the beer throughout the session. Not totally pitch black, but the darkest brown you could imagine. Beautiful beer!  S: Mild roasty coffee with a prominent hazelnut quality. Sweet, without being too.  T: Perfectly balanced - almost more of a stout, due to the lack of BBQ-like smoke flavor that I usually associate with this style. I detected a flash of fig-like fruitiness on the finish. Ahhh...  M: The creamy thickness of the beer cannot be bragged about enough. ABV is virtually undetectable.  D: ABV is reasonable and the ingredients perfectly balanced. I think I'll have another!  Overall: This is one of those rare beers that defines the style. Awesome and then some!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, vanilla, dark citrus, and slight hops. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Strong bitterness and sweetness qualities are well balanced. Tastes of roasted malt, slight coffee, hops, slight dark citrus, slight alcohol, and slight vanilla.

S: Smokey, hoppy, brown sugar, rich malt, chocolate. Wonderful.  T: Super-smokey - reminds me of Rauchbier. If you like this, try Schlenkerla. Extremely toasty malt dominates the flavor, but it's backed up by some nice hop notes and a bitter chocolatey bite. Lighter aftertaste than expected which makes it a joy to drink. A little less smoke and more hops would make it better I think.  M: Oily, wet texture. Good carbonation after all. Thick and a bit chewy. Medium-heavy body. A tad bit astringent.  D: Goes down wonderfully for the style. I couldn't ask for a more drinkable smoked porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Naugros,4.27,"Deep brown in color with a thin head that dies and leaves behind a tan crown and a slick of off-white. The crown sticks to the sides for a second and then slides back into the swamp.  Sweet, sweet roast delivering a complex bouquet of oak, earth and pepper to the nose. There's a very slight bitterness present that I can't figure out. Is it the roasted malts or is there actually a hops presence? Whatever it is, it's making for a nice balance.  The bitterness seems to be from the malts and if there are hops, then I can't pick them out. The roast leaves a dryness around the back of your mouth that's not so much a bitterness but a burnt sensation, like the aftertaste from eating burnt toast. This flavor is not really in the initial quaff, but in the wash. The initial sensation is sweet and brings roasted malts, oak and earth...almost as if someone had removed all the alcohol from bourbon...but who would commit such a felony?  The dryness is a really nice experience, continuing the pleasant ride that the smooth, medium body delivers. The taste, the body, the wash and the low ABV all make for a beer that you want to come back to. My nonic drained rather effortlessly.

Lacing is plentiful and really looks nice.  S: I get a mixture of roast and coffee on the nose, like chocolate covered coffee beans almost.  T: It has that nice roasty taste that I have come to love from porters. More coffee on the finish than anything else, and you can taste some of the bitterness on the mid-palate.  M: This beer has more carbonation than I would expect from a porter, but it's not overbearing. It feels good in the mouth, coats your palate well, and lingers for quite some time.  D: Very nice, I could easily drink a few of these in a row.

Has a crisp smokey taste to it. I've never described a beer as smokey, but this one definitely has a smokey flavor to it, combined with the chocolate this is an amazing beer.  This beer goes down extremely smooth, leaves a slight bitter/numbing effect to the tongue.  Notes: I had an extremely high expectation for this porter and it surpassed every expectation I had. An extremely drinkable beer, very heavy so your not going to drink a lot of them at one time. A great dessert beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Mouthfeel- Sticky and thick in the mouth , but the carbonation is approaching the brisk side so the thick body gets lifted and lightened a bit.  Drinkability- Smooth, fulfilling and tasty.

A- The main aroma is coffee and a bitter chocolate. There are hints of caramel or molasses.  T- A nicely balanced blend of coffee and chocolate throughout. Not overly bitter, but not to sweet either. They nailed it here. Some dark fruit and a touch of caramel is in play as well. There is a faint hop presence on the back end. I am really impressed by this porter, one of my favorites.

73,226,jjboesen,4.45,"We have all heard the song by Gordon Lightfoot; the one about the freighter Edmund Fitzgerald that was lost in the depths of Lake Superior. Apparently, the ship frequently made port in Cleveland. (one can also visit the sister ship, William Miller, that is open for tours and docked across from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.) But, I digress from the beer in hand.  The initial pour erupts in a violent vanilla froth that is slow to settle. The body is a deep ruby hue and completely impervious to light - much like the muddy bottom of Lake Superior, I suppose? The nose discerns a quick whiff of cocoa powder; the palate is flooded - much like the great ship - with roasted malt that provokes a surprisingly sweet and creamy finish.  Great Lakes is a brewery for whom I have established a high estimation. Now that it is available to us here in the East, this is a factor that will improve the beer drinking quality to all who know of it. Now, let us drink a toast to the brave souls who sleep within the rusted hulk of the Edmund Fitxgerald. Hit it Gordon....",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Dark chocolate, coffee with cream, roasted malt, a little bit of grassy and earthy hops. Awesome aftertaste. The balance is so well done.  Nice thickness for 5.8%, carbonation is good.

Lots of roasty and toasty notes accompanied by milk-chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, lactose, and subtle dark fruit (raisin, plum). Also lots of coffee in the nose. The hops are light and subtle, but give a little pine.  T: Amazingly balanced and pretty complex. Bittersweet chocolate and the hops provide a nice bitterness to balance the lactose, milk-chocolate, and dark fruit. The coffee simply excels this to a whole new level. I am also getting some nuttiness (coconut or macadamia?).  MF/D: Carbonation is spot on, allowing the fullness of the body to come out. The finish is a mixture of coffee and bittersweet chocolate.

73,226,RomaniIteDomum,4.32,"Pours black with a nice large fluffy head.  Smels of strong dark chocolate, coffee, cream, and a bit of burnt coffee bitterness.  Taste follows the nose. Sweet chocolate and creamed coffee up front with some nice bitter dark chocolate and black coffee. More depth swirling about, such as plum and sweet cream.  The feel is full-bodied and creamy, though I expected more.  I greatly enjoyed this beer and wish I had another. It went great with breakfast!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,feedsasquatch,4.26,"Drank this on tap at a pizza pub.  A - Didn't look too good. No head at all.  S - Dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and smokey.  T - Just like it smells. Dark chocolate, coffee, and malts. Surprisingly well-rounded flavor for the smell.  M - Very smooth. Almost creamy.  D - It's can stand on it's own two feet, or be paired with chocolate deserts as well as meats. Personally, I liked it with my salty breadsticks that I had before my pizza showed up.  This is good stuff! I will definitely purchase it again in the future.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,FreshmanPour77,4.45,"Reviewed on 7-01-10 Reviewed cold from a bottle to a glass  A - Dark pour, 2 fingers of tan creamy foam, can't see much due to how dark it is  S - Smoke, dark chocolate, hints of coffee and roasted malts. Not much of a hop presence in this one  T /M - Medium bodied and smooth with a nice dark chocolate smoke taste. The hints of coffee lingering about  D - A great blended brew in my book. One of the better porters that I have had so I highly recommend this brew. I am glad that Great Lakes finally came to Minnesota and started out with this as one of their brews. I will purchase this brew again!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,zaq37,4.37,"Bought this at a local shop in a 6 pack. shared a few with my brother but this is my first review of it. Poured into a DFH snifter  A- Black with a creamy tan head that stays around for a bit, not fizzing away at all. just for kicks i shined an LED flashlight through one side of the glass and looking directly into the light through the beer it gives the light a RED tint. very interesting.  S- Bitter Chocolate and dark malt. incredible aroma, sweet and very intense.  T- The taste matches the aroma quite a bit. Very sweet with a bitter dark chocolate finish. and not like pure 100% cocoa powder bitter, i mean like a bar of 80% cocoa, very dark tasting but still sweet enough to enjoy.  M- Creamy and smooth, the malt flavors stick around in the back of the throat for a while, so it has a very long finish, which i prefer in a beer.  D- Very nice, a great sipper for any occasion, i would suggest this more as a dessert beer, but it could be paired with some great food as well. not a beer to finish quickly, but something to enjoy and savor. Will DEFINITELY purchase again.  Love this beer, this 6 pack was my first sampling of it and i was greatly impressed with the taste and the aroma. i HIGHLY recommend this beer to anyone looking for a dark porter to enjoy. 2 thumbs up!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,TheHoppiest,4.7,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a deep brown with ruby accents that play in the light. Has a 2 inch tan head that reduces to a 1/8 inch foam top with sticky lacing down the sides.  Has a nice toasted malt smell to it, hints of chocolate and toffee tickle the nose. Always a tasty smelling brew.  Rich, roasted malt fills the mouth. Coffee bitters, dark chococalte, and caramel notes hit you, followed by a nice hop bitter finish that leaves the tongue tingling. Complex and well balanced, this battles with Founder's Porter as my favorite porters.  Smooth mouthfeel given the complexity of the beer. All the taste of a stout without the heaviness.  One of my favorites out there, and among my top two or three favorites in this style. Highly drinkable, you'll almost always find one in my fridge. And its from my hometown- what more can you ask for!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Fezfreak,4.83,"Absolutely one of the best Porters made in America. I was lucky enough to find a brewery-fresh batch with an Expiration date of November 2010.  Pours black as coffee with a generous head and good lacing right to the finish.  The smell has strong hints of roasted coffee beans with a subtle chocolate background.  The taste is dominated by smoky chocolate-coffee malt in the front and middle and finishes smooth and milky.  This would pair nicely with beef and pork dishes, but would also make a nice accompaniment to certain sweet desserts like ice cream (use your imagination).  Recommended!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Very drinkable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jsapunor,4.35,"A very dark opaque beer with some mahogany highlights. The head is caramel colored with nice retention and the rings will tell you where your last sip started and finished.  Coffee and chocolate in the aroma which is very smooth and builds expectations for the first taste.  The flavor is what you would expect from a great porter. There is coffee and bittersweet chocolate with a little sweetness, probably caramel in the back end.  This is a very mellow porter. The mouthfeel is soft and civilized; an extremely drinkable brew.  While I am a big fan of imperial porters, regular porter has never been my favorite style but if Edmund Fitzgerald could be found nearby that would change. It's worth the extra effort (read shipping charges) to obtain.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,biglite351,3.03,"A - reddish light through the middle of the glass. Rootbeer float like head that leaves a good amount of lacing.  S - extremely light. Mild roasted malts with a little bitter chocolate. Would be nice if it were stronger.  T - malts, mild dark chocolate and even milder coffee. Like the scent, it would be nicer if it was stronger.  M - mild coating a tingle on front of tongue.  D - easily drinkable, but the lightness of the flavor would probably make me grab something else.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,thetomG,4.38,"Pours a very dark brown with just a slight deep reddish tint - about 95% opaque, with a beautiful thick foamy white head.  Aroma is a delicious bouquet of roasty malt, chocolate, and coffee. Flavor is remarkably similar with just a slightly hoppy element added in to give it a slight twinge of bitterness in the finish.  Incredibly easy to drink with excellent balance between being smooth and syrupy this is an amazing medium-bodied beer. Really really tasty! Will DEFINITELY be drinking more of this!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,demcorhip,4.25,"A nice looking porter. Black, although not completely opaque, nice ruby toned highlights near the edges when backlit. A finger of tan head formed on the pour, and settled into a decent collar of lace.  Caramel nougat and pleasant espresso roasted notes. A touch of lactic sourness as well. A touch of leafy and earthy hops also present. Very nice aroma.  Nice stuff. Whole grains, and the caramel nougat and roasted notes present. The malt profile is bang on and the malt components work great together. Been after this one for years, and was glad to finally score it. Was worth the wait, and when it rains it pours, a beer buddy managed to score some too. A slight sourness leads into a more acrid and roasted flavour with a whiff of smoke.  Nice mouthfeel. Slightly creamy, quite smooth, almost medium bodied. Roasted malts and a touch of sourness play off the richer malts quite nicely. Hops take the backseat and let the other ingredients shine.  Quite drinkable, although not something i would attempt sessioning. Then again i might feel differently come fall or winter. Paired nicely with the aged gouda and crackers. Will enjoy revisiting this tasty porter. Worthy of its reputaiton.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,CosmoHopHead,4.42,"A: looks like coffee or dark cola with a nice, tan two finger head that slowly went down. mild lacing left on the glass  S: smells almost earthy with great fresh coffee beans and some chocolate and roasted malts. not too sweet, just right  T: yes, this is how a porter should taste. fantastic blend of coffee and roasted chocolate malts with a crisp hop backbone  M: feels excellent in the mouth, light and bubbly. perfect carbonation with a slight dryness on the back end  D: amazing drinkability! goes down smooth and easy with a nice roasted, malty, dry finish.  Overall, I wish like hell I had access to this all the time. Would be a perfect fall/winter time session porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,dpasotti,4.47,"Edmund Fitzgerald is damn near opaque, dark brown in color. The enduring beige crown consists of a nice-looking blend of large and tiny bubbles, and delivers a critical mass of lacing all the way to the last sip. Perfectly-melded aromas of roasted malt, chocolate and a slight woody note really pull me in.  Similar flavor profile: semi-sweet chocolate, excellent roasty notes, medium caramel malt, some vanilla, and just enough hop bitterness (and flavor) to keep things in check. This beer is textbook balance, ""like a squirrel on a telephone line,"" as Ray Hudson would say.  Intermediate carbonation combined with a slightly too-thin body doesn't quite reach optimal fullness, which is literally my only complaint with this excellent beer. A light coffee aftertaste lingers for a bit and makes me keep coming back. My first beer from Great Lakes has set the bar high. This outstanding offering almost tops Founders Porter as best of the style in my book.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

This beer appeared almost black in the glass, but definitely showed its true deep-brown color off the pour.  S-Chocolate, dark berry esters. Bittersweetness.  T-Bitter chocolate character with just a hint of choco semi-sweetness., along with some bitter coffee coming through in the aftertaste. Smokey-roasty character is prevelent, with just a hint of roasty bite. Light esters provide a hint of perceived sweetness. FInishes dry.  M-Moderate body proves to be very easy drinking. Carbonation is medium-level, in line with expectations.  D-So very drinkable. This porter is very densely-packed with choco-roasty malt flavors, while stil being easy and enjoyable to drink.

M- carbonation is lower medium with a nice body and a good smooth finish  D- Really enjoy this beer, is what i will most likely compare all porters to for now on, not my favorite style but definitely my favorite of the style that i have had so far",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,TMoney2591,4,"Served in a nonic pint glass at ChurchKey.  My choice: try the Gordon Lightfoot story song-inspired brew (trust me, it was inspired more by that Canadian siren's sonorous elegy (yes, men can be sirens too...equal rights and all...) than the namesake ship and its misfortune) from a bottle or from the tap. Well, I'm enjoying the CK today, so draught it is. It pours a clear dark garnet-brown with about a finger-and-a-half of foamy ecru head, which takes a while to completely die out, leaving decent alcing behind as it does so. The nose is coffee, molasses, bitter dark chocolate, dark malts, and a light breeze of hops. The taste sees a return of the coffee, bitter chocolate (this time in powder form), and the hops, heavy on the floral notes. What's new is a small appearance from a light maple syrup. The body is medium, tending toward the lighter end but not committing, with a lightly moderate carbonation and an ever-so-slight mouth coating. Not a bad porter in any respect, but nothing really that special, either.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,pmccallum86,4.53,"Pours a deep brown coffee color with a huge two finger tan head that dissipates very slowly leaving a huge bubbly head.

Lots is going on here, very good porter deserving of it sterling reputation. Some bitter hops in the finish but mostly chocolate flavors here.

Really nice carbonation level and an awesome porter.  I know my description could be applied to many beers of this style, but this is better than almost any porter I've had.

73,226,DerekP,4.5,"This beer is as black as a stout, and smells of rich, rich coffee, brewed with dark cocoa. On top sits a delicious looking, fluffy beige head. I haven't even tasted it yet (not my first, but it's been a while).  The taste is dark & burnt, like pile driving your face into a fire pit flooded by last night's rain. The lacing is clinging.  The feel of this brew is silky and creamy, but in the manner that melted dark chocolate is silky and creamy.  This delicious specimen of brew master passion & effort has besieged my brain with thoughts of a heavy breakfast, filled to the brim with eggs, potatoes, bacon & sausage, and followed by a delicious chocolate pastry for an after-breakfast dessert.

73,226,zhooker,4.47,"I feel like porters are the most authentic, that is to say original, ales. At least in the modern beer-drinking era (I.e., not including meads, braggots, etc). Of course I have no historical data to back this up; just a feeling.  Anyways -- back in Ohio to visit the fam, another Great Lakes to review. Poured from a 12oz bottle to a DFH pint glass. Dark -- almost opaque -- but enough light glimmering through to give it a DEEP amber glint here and there. Huge, rocky head peaks over the glass, slowly bubbling and dissipating, leaving a bevy of pretty lace en route.  Diving in for the first sip, it's all bittersweet chocolate on the nose. Insanely robust maltiness. A few sips later, I'm feeling coffee more than the chocolate. Big aroma, and all the parts are working together.  Through the first quarter of the glass, I'm really surprised by the hop presence, given how big the malts were in the scent. They're subtle, and the malts still definitely reign, but the bitter finish is there. There is a sweetness here, but not one I would tire of after two or three pints. It's a pleasant, balanced sweetness. Choco-coffee remains the predominant flavor. Mocha latte anyone? Jokes, folk. This brew's got a lot more meat on it than a fancy cuppa.  The mouthfeel is smooth, but I do feel a little thickening building at the back of my throat due to the sweetness. It would take three to four pints for this to become annoying though.  This is a model porter. It is distinguished by its robust malts and its chocolate/coffee flavors, but nothing is so big that its out of balance. I could drink this all night. I have had this beer at least a dozen times, and this is the first time I've sat down to reflect a little and write about it.

Slight sweetness to balance it out, but the bitterness lingers. It's been awhile since I had a good porter, and this one is reminding me why I used to like them so much.  M: Medium bodied.

73,226,boatshoes,4.45,"One of my favorite porters, though I am from central Ohio and like to support our breweries. I've had this many times and am finally getting around to reviewing it after a buddy brought over a sixer.  Appearance- Pours a not quite opaque, slightly ruddy around the edges shade of black with about a finger cap of creamy tannish head on top. Decent retention but dies back to a sheet across the top.  Smell- Rich roasted malts, some medium roast coffee, and some bitter chocolate to boot. Very rich smelling in a very flavorful combination.  Taste- Thick and substantial roasted malt starts off and rounds out this porter. Filled in again with a good deal of coffee roastiness and some slight bitter dark chocolate flavors as well. Not a huge variety but all flavors are bold, rich, and well rounded.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is very substantial for a porter but not overly heavy, with very appropriate levels of carbonation. Drinkability is great for someone looking for rich flavor that won't overwhelm you after one beer.  Overall, one of my favorite porters and I will miss it when I move out west in the fall. A great example of the style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,udubdawg,4.34,"Pours very dark brown, suggestion of bright amber where light sneaks through at the edges. An inch of tan creamy foam slowly fades and leaves entire sheets of lace. Beautiful.  I generally prefer the more caramelized- or chocolate-intensive heavy aromas of say a Black Butte or London Porter, but this is still good. It's quite roasted, more than a little coffee. Similar to a dry stout, and I'm thinking I might call it that if blindfolded. As it warms some cocoa powder comes out.  Big, full flavors. More roasty bitter black malts are in evidence. Some sweeter flavors but not quite balancing the hops/charred bitter edge. Overall effect is quite drying and demands another gulp. This pretty much defines ""robust"" though I again see it is a pretty short trip to the stout category - whereas I mentioned dry in the aroma I'm thinking more similarities to an American Stout in the flavor. Either way it's very very tasty.  Mouthfeel is supremely good, full, creamy, carbonation soft. Dangerously smooth.

This is the taste of a flag ship porter, one that I would recommend to those looking to find a beer that represents the style very well. The flavors mellow together as the beer warms.

The pour is a nice black color with beautiful amber highlights when held to the light and a big frothy head on it that is a light tan color and rises to about two fingers. The heads retention is good as well as the sticky lacing on my glass.  S= The smell is pretty good for a porter. Nice roast to it. Good coffee smell with a little very little smokeyness. There is a decent dark chocolate smell to it but mostly the intense roastyness. Pretty good smell for a porter.  T= The taste is again a nice intense roast to it. Smooth chocolate in it as well as some nice coffee notes. Not as good as the Black Butte porter in the taste but still world class I would say. A little smokeyness and a good sweetness to back it up a little.  M= Sliky smooth and delicious. Great mouth on this.  D= Great brew. Excellent Porter but doesn't quite live up to the Black Butte porter. Prolly my second favorite porter to date and I may come back to it time and time again when the Black Butte gets boring.

When I poured it into my stout/porter glass, I was taken back by how thin this beer appeared. Wasn't expecting that. Very thin. Also, this beer had nothing left on the bottom of the bottle so it isn't conditioned at all. Weird but the all important taste is coming up. Little white bubbles stay around for quite some time. Very Very thin lacing.  S - Smoke peat. Burnt caramel and chocolate. Good malt backbone. Smell is very nice. Reminds me of Furthermore's Three Feet Deep in smell and appearance. And now for the taste.  T - Very different than I was expecting but not in a bad way. Very Smokey. Earth and soil. Dark caves. Fall. Damp and rotting leaves. Different than any American Porter that I have had. Good. I will definitely purchase this again...and the price is right too. Just different than I was expecting.  M - I wish it was thicker. This is one of the thinnest porters I have had in some time. This is my biggest complaint about this beer. Doesn't stick to anything. Water? Tastes better than water but very thin. What this porter has on taste and smell, it lacks in mouthfeel.  D - Yes...very drinkable. I will purchase this again.  Overall, I was really hoping for a WOW and I didn't get it with this one. Really good beer....yes but not a WOW for me. Darn.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,bsp77,4.41,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint.  Appearance: Looks black but glows ruby red around the edges. Thick foamy tan head and light lacing.  Smell: Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. Standard Porter aroma, but done well.  Taste: Bittersweet malt taste of roasted barley, dark chocolate, coffee and a touch of licorice. Somewhat smokey. Just slightly bitter toward the end, mostly from the high level of roasting.  Feel: Unbelievably smooth, rich body with low carbonation and a dry finish. Just slightly on the thin side and prevents a perfect score here.  Drinkability: Very smooth, easy to drink Porter that does everything right. That said, by playing it safe, it does not quite hit the stratosphere.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,WYVYRN527,4.42,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle with best before date 10/18/10.  A: Pours very dark brown with a crimson hue around the edges. Head is cream colored and settles to a very nice film on the surface. Lacing is also very desireable.  S: Smell is mainly dark chocolate with some roasty coffee notes, and just a hint of smoke.  T: Roasty, espresso like flavors combine with hints of chocolate to form a bitter, yet sweet plethora of flavor. Hops are distictly present here, lending some fruity and grassy notes in the finish.  M & D: Dry, and medium bodied, yet has a velvety mouthfeel that makes this porter unique. It's clean, but very flavorful and easy to drink. It's worth trying, and is very sessionable for the style. No matter what the temperature is, I could drink this all year long.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ghostee,4.05,"Updating my review after having this again, with some more reviewing experience under my belt.  Pours a dark brown with a hint of red visible under light. A bit of light does come through. Has 1.5 fingers of light tan colored head, which recedes over time leaving a layer on the top and lots of lacing on the sides.  Smell is of chocolate, coffee, with a hint of dark fruit. A bit of hops are also present.  Taste is definitely chocolate heavy. The coffee from the nose makes a strong appearance in the taste, as well as roasted malts. The bit of hoppiness that I smelt also re-appears in the tail end of the sip. Overall taste is slightly roasty, a tiny bit of bitterness at the end.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, and medium carbonation. A bit of prickling of the tongue from the hops in this. There seems to be a bit of sediment that coats the tongue and mouth, like after drinking the bottom of a cup of hot cocoa.  Drinkability is fairly high. This is easy to drink, not too high of an ABV.  This is a good porter, not my favorite, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Parrotbeak,4.45,"Mahogany with a thin, tan head that gradually fades, leaving some patches. Decent lacing. Smell is dark chocolatey malts, with some faint fresh hops. Cocoa, toffee, and some hints of cinnamon. Taste is again rich, dark chocolatey malts, with a faint hop presence towards the finish. The malts carry to the finish, remaining toasty and chocolatey. More cocoa and faint toffee, as well as some cinnamon (or perhaps molasses). Very well-balanced beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a clean finish. Medium-light body. Extremely easy to drink. This is one well-balanced and tasty beer; I could drink it all night.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,MrStark,4.3,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a nonic pint glass.  Appearance is a dark brown with ruby highlights that has a fair amount of translucency. Its topped with a slightly foamy tan two finger head with decent retention and lacing.  Smell is a pretty balanced aroma of roasted malts, coffee and a bit of bitter hops.  Taste is a nice blend of coffee, roasted malts, hints of dark chocolate and little hop presence in the end to balance it all out. A fairly complex and well balanced brew.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a good amount of carbonation.  Drinkability is pretty good. It goes down smooth, and is tasty. A good session porter. Not as complex as others I've had but all around a great brew that's certainly worth a try. I will be having this again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Great Lakes did a phenomenal job with this one.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Agold,4.45,"This beer pours almost pitch black. I held it up to the light and saw a bit of redness. The head is big and fluffy and recedes to a quarter inch fairly quickly. The smell is of roasted malts and chocolate. This beer tastes great. I love the coffee and chocolate flavors which blend with the roasted malts to create an almost ideal porter taste. I thought that there was good mouth feel, and good carbonation, but I thought it could have been just a little more full bodied (maybe I'm just being a bit picky). Good drinkability as well. Great example of a porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,TCgoalie,4.35,"Notes from 4/27/10  A quarter finger head sits atop a very dark brown brew. Held up to the light, you can see through it but it isn't noticeable while sitting on the table. Lacing is present, but is understated.  There is a lot of dark chocolate in the smell with some smokiness. A coffee edge shines through dark malts with a hint of vanilla.  This is sweeter than expected, but well balanced. The sweet seems to come from toffee. There is a lot of roasted coffee in the back end with the chocolate being somewhat subdued throughout. I'm not getting any vanilla in the taste, maybe I made that up in the smell?  Edmund is a medium bodied Porter with a nice wet aftertaste that comes from a nice coating of the mouth...if that makes any sense.  This is very drinkable and very solid. This is what a Porter should taste like!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,bfboy,4.68,"Poured into a 16 oz tumbler. Dark, almost black. Good head and lacing. Smell is strongly smoky and chocolately. Tasted very good, with a slight aftertaste of smokeyness.

Smell is chocolatey, smokey with hints of nuts. The taste is charcoal, nuts, dark chocolate, and burnt toast; bitter with some sweet notes. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, crisp.  This is one of the best American Porters I've ever had. It definitely belongs in the Top 10 for the style. Highly drinkable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S: Smoky, bittersweet roasted malts. Pretty much matches the description on the label.  T: Malty with a bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. Not as sweet as I expected for a porter, but pretty good.  M: Super smooth. Not too thick, just right.  D: Good after dinner drink. Not too rich to make you feel full. Nice substitute for coffee. Pretty high on my list of porters.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,rawthar,4.15,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  A- What looks as black as pitch in the shadow reveals a deep caramel brown in the light. The sandy tan head rises above the rim of the glass and hangs around long enough to leave its mark on the glass before slowly retreating.  S- So many components that it's hard to catalog all of them, but smoke, caramel, burnt wood, roasted coffee, and chocolate are all safe bets.  T- Same flavors as the smell. This tastes like you're drinking a campfire, though in a delicious way, if that's possible. Caramel sweetness is the first punch, but that's quickly washed out by an intense smoky, roasty bitterness, which in turn fades away quickly, leaving a dry burnt pleasant aftertaste.  M- As a frequent drinker of RIS, this intentionally comes off a little light, which is both a positive and a negative. Good if you're drinking many, a little disappointing if you're only planning on drinking one.  D- The satisfying aftertaste doesn't have time to stick around, because you'll be taking swig after swig.  This is an awesome beer. Worthy of the hype and awards? Maybe, but I'll have to revisit after exploring some more porters.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

A: 1/4 inch head with nice lacing and a dark brown color.  S: Very coffeeish; char chocolate smell balances it out in the background. All much better than I remember so far, although it almost smells watery, which is odd.  T: Just solid; I don't think it's one of the top 100 brews of all-time, but I get why everyone like's it. It is bubbly with a strong coffee char flavor and a nice smooth aftertaste. Very creamy and gets better as it warms. Definitely better than I remember.  D/M: Very nice feel and easily drinkable.

T: The taste is huge with coffee and chocolate with a slight vanilla flavor and a roasty bitterness on the finish.  M: The feel is nice and creamy and pretty thick. Very nice...

The initial taste of the beer was the roast, coffee, and alcohol. The beer finished with a roasty flavor that didn't linger too long. This brew had a light to medium body with light to medium carbonation. Additionally the beer was slightly bitter complimenting the flavors presented.  All in all this is a nice porter and one that I will come back to for the excellent flavor and low price. I gave a lower mouth feel, primarily because I would have liked the porter to be a bit thicker bodied.

Hopefully someday soon Great Lakes will make it to Massachusetts, but for now I must capitalize when I can. I've been to the brewery in Cleveland and I'm a believer. Great Lakes makes some awesome beers.  Pours a jet black with ruby highlights on the bottom of the glass.  Big ole' fluffy head forms on top leaving nice trails of sticky lacings.  Aroma of roasted coffee notes, dairy and spicy hops.  Espresso flavors develop on the palate. Dark roasted malts, smoked qualities and ripe cherries dipped in rich chocolate. A complex beer overall.

The aromas on this brew are quite rich and abundant consisting of both roasted and sweet malts, generous chocolate and robust coffee.  The palate is similar to the aroma with roasted malts up front, rich and toasty, followed by sweet chocolate, and then hearty coffee with a finish that is part bitter and part roasted.  The mouthfeel is rich with toastyness and bitterness with medium carbonation and a robust body.  This is an excellent beer and proves itself worthy of the reviews it receives.

From the small tasting, I knew it was imperative that I get myself a bottle. I purchased a bottle today, chilled it tonight, and had it while watching a Phillies game. This porter pours a dark ruby color, which turns to almost black when fully emptied into the glass. Carbonation is minimal, but apparent (more so than I would have expected). Aroma is fantastic, smelling of dark chocolate and malts. Smooth at first, a bitterness becomes apparent after swallowing. Not overwhelming in the least; pleasant and enjoyable.

Retention is good and lacing is alright.  Nose is chocolate cocoa with a mild roast character and marshmallow sweetness. Not much hop aroma and the fruitiness is kept to a minimum. What is there is really good, but it does not smack me in the face as much as I thought it would.  Taste does a good job of balancing roasty malt and sweet chocolate flavors. Leafy hops have a prevalent role in the flavor and are helped out some by the roast in the bitterness department. Milk Duds candy comes to mind as it warms up a bit. Does not lack in flavor or body, it has a nice creamy feel. One of those beers you just do not want to end.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

While it has good flavor it isn't quite as full flavored as Black Butte Porter.  M - This is the weakest part of the beer. Medium body with a little too much carbonation.  D - This is a good beer and it is easy to drink. One of the best porters I've had but after drinking Black Butte the past week while in Vegas this one really can't match it.

The liquid is a mostly blackish brown with a patina of metallic orange around the outside. The nose has an excellent balance between roast and sweetness, coffee bean, milk chocolate, licorice, butterscotch, cooked oats, cherry and blackberry fruit, the hops do not reveal distinct scents, however, do condition the texture in your nostrils, lending dry bite. Medium-bodied, firm and displays good thrust in getting from start to finish. More roast in the coffee and mocha flavors here, more granola, oats and bread grains as well. Orange zest makes an appearance now and then. Smokehouse wood notes obscure some of the cherry, plum fruit. The carbonation is moderate, no fluffiness added just a slow mixing of the flavors. Metallic nuances linger at the end and extend the complete presence.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BarBEERian,4.75,"The Edmund Fitz poured a deep and dark ruby-red and dark-chocolate color that let some subtle light through when the glass was held to the light. The smell was also rather potent, with clear splashes of bittersweet coffee and chocolate mashing together with a hearty and meaty roasted-nut scent. The head on the beer disappeared quickly, with only large toffee-colored bubbles sticking around for more than a minute. The taste was just as desirable as I remember it being, with a rather smooth and drinkable bitterness staying put until the earthy and dulled down bitter coffee flavor takes your hand through the rest of the sip. The combination or the roasted nut flavor and a well-blended iced coffee only presents itself further as the beer warms. Usually, I'd be looking for a creamy and sweeter flavor to help roll through the tide of dulled-flavor, but that's what makes this a great porter and so drinkable.  For a porter, this beer certainly has a lot of bite to it. But considering it only clocks in around 5.5% ABV, you can have quite a few of these before your night is done early. Sure, this is definitely a bottom-heavy beer with most of the flavor notes kicking in near the end, but if you're looking for a well-done porter that sticks to a style without any real quirks or superfluousness, then this ship-wreck of a beer is for you.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The aromas carry over into the taste; especially the malted milk and coco; nutty(walnuts, pecans). The flavors are mild and pleasant.  It has a creamy, light to medium body.

73,226,tubacharlie,4.3,"Lightly smoked coffee aroma.  Two-finger creamy tan head when poured, with good lacing stuck to the sides as the brew is consumed. Dense, but clear, very dark red-brown color.  Strong coffee flavor with a hint of dark chocolate and some smokiness. Well developed malts and pleasant hop afterburn. Creamy smooth carbonation on the palate. A very good example of the porter style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,TonyReaves,4.52,"Would've sworn this was black as night when I had one at Clark's Ale House, but back home I see ruby highlights under the two-finger head.  Smell is beautifully roasty/smoky. Dark chocolate and cherries. Incredible.  Hits me first with dark chocolate, dark bread and hints of fruitiness. Roastiness is huge, with smokiness and a trace of hop bitterness in the finish. I love this. It's blasphemy, but I'd grab one of these before a Geary's porter.  Despite a good amount of carbonation, this feels smooth, thick, chewy. If this heavy, smooth, roasty beer is a porter, then I have no idea what the difference is between a porter and a stout. Not that I'm complaining.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jpro,4.09,"Near black, held to light = garnet, with a smallish, light tan head that shows good retention but doesn't leave a ton of lace. Aroma is great: roasted malts, rich chocolatey-ness and heavy caramel notes. Taste is a nice, chocolate sweetness; roasted tones are there; the sweetness is balanced by a dry (smoky?) finish with a bit of an unexpected hop/citrusy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with some fairly high carbonation. A very enjoyable porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,tippebrewcrew2,4.33,"This is my favorite porter to date. Founders porter and great lakes edmund fitzgerald. I want the Fitz because great lakes does not distribute to my area so it is my favorite out of shear want. Pours a black tawny with a minimal head. Big coffee on the nose and semi sweet chocolate. Nice dark chocolate bitter finish. It is very creamy , smooth, with a slight velvety feel. Amazing",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,hayesez,4.35,"Received in a trade from ceptrone84...  Poured into a Rose-Hulman pint glass. Deep, dark mahogany that lets very little light seep through. A one finger sandstone head forms quickly before slowly retracting, leaving a nice pre-lace on the edges. As I slowly put this away, the lace continues to follow the surface all the way down my pint glass.  Smells primarily of coffee and chocolate. Very roasty, very nice.  That strong roastiness is also very present as I take my first sip. A heavy beer that is nice and full in the mouth. Coffee is very prominent, running point for the taste. A lingering bitter coffee is left long after I've finished my pull. Wow, that's a lot of coffee...there is a bit of sweetness in the middle stages of this one, as well as just a bit of chocolate right before the aftertaste kicks in. A very enjoyable porter for sure.  This is a great beer that Great Lakes continually pumps out. I've had it on a few occasions and am always impressed by how solid it is. Certainly a beer I'd never turn down!  Consumed: 3/11/2010",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Nearly black with the faintest of amber hues barely visible around the edges of the glass in color with a thick, chunky tannish head that leaves plenty of nice lacing.  Smells of dark, bittersweet chocolate and roasted caramel...  Rich caramel malt and chocolate up front with a mild coffee-like bitter finish.  Medium mouthfeel, thick and silky smooth...  This is without a doubt, one of the best porters I've had in quite some time - maybe ever. To say this would make a great session brew and getting a case of this is a must. Easy going, yet has enough bawls to fully satisfy a big beer appetite...",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Beejay,4.09,"A: Pours a lovely mahogany brown in the glass it is very dark brown with red highlights when held to the light. Nice thick light tan head, fluffy, and holding firm.  S: Slight roasted coffee, and burnt sugar or caramel.  T: Roasted malts all the way through, with a little bite in the finish. Classic porter taste.. roasty, slightly smokey and delicious.  M: Fairly light in body, though a little creamy smooth. Carbonation may be a tad high, but damn that's a nice brew.  D: Hell yeah. Not so thick that it is a chore, could easily go through a few of these in an evening. Tasty.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Had an above average look and smell, definitely a good looking porter. Taste was of coffee and chocolate, with some earthy toffee notes. Mouthfeel was just average.

Both the aroma and taste has loads of roasted malt flavors, sometimes in the disguise of coffee, and with caramel covered vanilla ice cream note backing them up melding them all together.  Has a good medium viscosity for a porter, thick enough to be great, but its not as thick as other porters such as Founders. along with the medium oily viscosity it has a somewhat dryer finish, adding to the drinkability.  A very Solid Porter for the 6 pack format. This one along with, Founders,Deschutes, and Anchor are the 4 best buys there are in the land of porters. well done Great Lakes.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,manahansf,4.73,Pours a clear and bright mahogany color topped with a creamy one finger tan head. The frothy head gives off a bold roasted malt aroma. The flavor full of both roasted coffee and sweet chocolate. The body complements the taste with a thick and heavy feel and low levels of carbonation. Smooth and velvety drink brings on a slowly fading finish which leaves behind a sweet malty taste.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,SeasonalBrew,4.18,"A: Pours a deep and dark, like coffee. A nice tan head forms that leaves some lacing in layers as you drink it.  S: Smells like strong roasted coffee and chocolate. A little bit of smokiness to it, as well.  T: Tastes of coffee and bittersweet chocolate are very smooth. Some malts and a little caramel sweetness, too. Slightly bitter notes hit you at the end.  M: It's a firm-bodied brew with a creamy smoothness to it. I really love the consistency.  D: The creamy feel to it makes you wish every beer went down like that. The flavor notes are great and not overwhelming at the same time. I could definitely go for another!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jbails007,4.67,"Got this on-tap at my favorite local place.  Appearance: Pitch black. I compared it to my friend's Budweiser. Talk about night and day. Nice tan head as well. Left a moderate amount of lacing on the glass.  Smell: Very, very appealing smell. Coffee, chocolate, and a little caramel. Smells like a delicious treat.  Taste: Not overpowering at all, a nice mellow beer overall. Coffee, chocolate, and a somewhat hoppy finish. Some bitterness present, but it's a good bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Really nice full-bodied beer. It fills the mouth with all kinds of great sensations. Again, not overpowering in the least bit.  Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable, but it's not the kind of beer you just pound a few of. This is a beer to sit down and enjoy.  Overall: Definitely the best porter I've had, and one of the best beers period. It tastes great, goes down easy, looks and smells great. Just a fantastic well-rounded beer that proves beer can be just as enjoyable as a nice dessert.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S: This thing smells of smoke, caramel, coffee, malt, and chocolate. Amazing  T: The taste is malt, chocolate, smoke, and coffee.  M: The mouthfeel is so creamy and rich. For a porter, this is quite thick in my opinion. The draft style of this beer is amazing.  D: I am almost 3/4 of the way through a growler and I wish I had more. What an amazing beer!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Definitely worthy.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,HoosBrews,4.73,"It had been years since I had this beauty, but was eager to try it again now that Great Lakes is in North Carolina. Served to me in a pint glass at Custom Home Pubs. Appearance was typical of a porter, dark and moderately carbonated. Decent nose, not a lot of overwhelming aromas, but very subtle. The taste is unconventionally smooth for a porter. I'm not a huge fan of porters as a style, but I could drink this all day. Perfect balance and mouthfeel. Highly drinkable and quite possibly the best porter I've ever had.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,magine,4.42,"Brew poured into a mug.  Pours a dark brown/coffee color. Has a thick fluffy tan head. Brew leaves a great lace and an island of lace for the head.  Brew smells of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, slight bitter hop smell. Great smell.  Brew tastes robust; chocolate, coffee, roasted, smokey malts. Bittersweet in the finish and aftertaste. Very smooth mouthfeel and a nice balance of carbonation. Excellent porter.  Wow Great Lakes is a very, very good brewery that I am now just trying. This brew is a world class porter, which I could session all night long. This is one of the best porters I have ever had, and has renewed my interest in trying different porters.

T-More smoky, roasted malt goodness here, dark chocolate, a touch of espresso.  M-Medium body with just the right amount of carbonation (less than most porters have), very smooth and a bit creamy.

Has a thin tan head that dissipates at a fairly normal rate but always leaves some remaining, as well as great lacing  Smells of malts and dark chocolate, some caramel and even coffee. The taste is so rich and amazing. Full of chocolate, coffee, and caramel with the roasted malts coming through towards the back end of each sip. There is a slight bitterness in the aftertaste, but it goes away very quickly. A great balance between the flavors.  The mouthfeel is so smooth and creamy with the right amount of carbonation.

T - Roasted goodness up front, some chocolate, a little woody-gin smell.  T - Malts, a little woody but not overpoweringly so as in a lot of porters. Slightly sweet and bitter at the same time, but with a nice dry finish.  M - Low too medium carbonation and lighter bodied than you would expect.  D - Highly drinkable porter as it is nicely balanced and there are no overpowering tastes that would begin to resonate.

73,226,Sweetmambyjamby,3.9,"Poured into my glass this one offered almost no head or lacing to speak of. The color was so dark brown that it was almost black. Smelled a little bit chocolatey, malts were there and barley. There was also some smokiness to the smell. The taste was good very good. The taste was how it smelled. The malts were there and smokiness. A little bit too boozy of a taste. It was a very good beer and I would drink it again, but not more than one at a time. But I still rate it high because it is a very good beer. Just not my style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,PeprSprYoFace,4.54,Wow. This is a good porter. I always looked at Black Butte as the standard porter but this one is even better.  Pours a dark black but with brown hues. Not as black as an RIS but upthere. There is no real head though. No lacing.  Aroma is wonderful. Lots of dark chocolate and roastyness. A hint of sweetness.  Taste is awesome. Great roastyness but balanced by the maltiness. Everything you would expect from a good porter.  Mouthfeel is great. Good malt mouthfeel and great carb for style.

This case just came in the beer distributors yesterday and I grabed it and sure glad I did as this is one of the Best Porters I have ever drank they have really pulled out a great one here.

T: Wow; heavy on the roasted malts, bitter chocolate brownie, and espresso all smoked over a strong campfire. The smoky wood and leather taste is just amazing; in a way, it has the same smoked taste as a Laphroaig scotch.  M: Big and chewy, a lot to ruminate over.

73,226,AmberMan22,4.85,"Pours a near solid-black, with some faint garnet hues when held to the light. A nice fluffy tan-colored head adorns the top.  Smells heavily of dark chocolatey (and maybe some caramel) malt. Nice hint of smoke, maybe some bitter espresso too.  Taste is wonderful. Perfectly rich and malty, with a perfect touch of hop bitterness to cap it off.  Mouthfeel is equally impressive. Thick and chewy, not overly carbonated. C'est parfait.

73,226,Bubba83,4.33,"More thanks go to Kegatron as I try to review all the beers he sends me.  Pours black but actually has some slight dark brown and ruby hues also near the outer edges. Creamy light tan foam on top, just the right amount of it. Great lacing and retention.  Smells predominantly like coffee. There's some vanilla underneath that and some citric hop character. I like what I smell here, but it could use some complexity with some chocolate notes.  Taste however is not lacking complexity. I get bittersweet chocolate up front along with some dark caramel, toffee, and vanilla. I even get some fruity fig hints before receiving a healthy dose of coffee and roasted malt. It doesn't take long before the strong citrus hops explode in your mouth. The finish is sort of a dry roast. This may very well be the hoppiest porter I've ever had.  I'm pretty happy with the mouthfeel too, sort of medium-thin but still has some slickness to it. The creamy head is a nice feature. It could maybe be improved if it was a little more lively with carbonation, or if not that then it could be more velvety, one or the other.  Drinks like a champ, nice and dry, smooth, not overly sweet. To be honest, I'm a little surprised that such a hoppy porter ends up working out so well, I would never have imagined. At this pricepoint, I need to be seeking Great Lakes stuff out from online stores more often.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Brent,4,"This may be the architypical American porter. Not much head with vigorous pour. Well moderated roasted malt flavors and balanced hopping. Finished a little dry.

S: Very soothing, unsweetened chocolatey smell. Great roasted malts and a touch of coffee.  T: Mouthgasm. As the smell would suggest, roasted malts are very evident, chocolate, and coffee. After the swallow a tiny nudge of hops completes the package.  M: Very enjoyable mouthfeel.  D: I had three and wish I had another, goes down easy!

The aroma is dark chocolate and coffee accompanied with a nice touch of citrus and pine.  The taste brings out more bitter roasty flavors which mingles with pine and bittering hops...initially the chocolate/coffee flavors dominate but before the finish pine and citrus...the finish is actually nicely balanced...pretty interesting  Solid body with medium carbonation which delivers bright hoppy flavors on top of the malt backbone  This beer drinks really easily...this finish cleans everything out enough for me to keep wanting to drink,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

D - Well it is a porter so it will sit heavy - that's okay though. There's no legitimate reason why you would really need more than one of these. Make a beer that is this good last!

Just enough light gets through to let you know that this is a sessionable beer rather than an overwhelming one.

S - Deep roasty character, dark fruits, currants. Sweet malt aroma in the background. Milid citrusy hop character.  T - Sharp roast up front followed by bold American hop flavor. Mineral character overtakes mid-swallow. Roast is pretty one dimensional at first, but develops chocloate flavors as the beer warms. Firm bitterness.  M - Medium body and carbonation. Roast and hops assist in a dry finish, but it is still surprisingly smooth and creamy.  D - Great beer.

The carbonation is noticeable enough to know it is there, but that is all, which is perfect for a porter.  M - medium body.

73,226,morimech,3.51,"Best before date of 04/24/10.  Pours dark brown with a red tint. A large tan head forms and has very good retention before settling to a thick cap. Rings of lacing is left on the glass. Aroma consists of roasted malt, milk chocolate, and hay. Had to search a little to find the roasted malt. The flavor is not that porterish. Sweeter than what I was expecting. The score I gave it is more than generous. The flavor is a combination of chocolate, cherries, and a herbal quality I cannot place. Maybe this bottle is off. Medium body and good carbonation. Has life without being harsh. Nice texture. The flavor just does not suit me. I will need another example and come back and judge this beer again because I cannot believe this is the best of the American Porters.  05/09/2010 Review Revisted this beer since it is brand new to the market. Best before date of 10/05/2010. I will bump up the taste score from 3 to 3.5 but otherwise my original ratings stand. The score increase is because this time I picked up more subtle flavors. Definate C-hop flavor that gives more of a bittersweet aspect. Still many porters out there that are better than this.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Durge,4.12,"Tested at room temperature in the big pint glass I see classic dark mahogany color, semi-opaque, with a big frothy light brown head and good lacing. The aroma offers tart cocoa malt and touches of mango nuttiness. Quite nice. The taste buds say yum to more of this burst of malt & coffee bean bite, dry charcoal wood, some herbal hop, and even some banana mango hints. Just a fine mouthful of flavor with a decent medium body that offers a bit of a silky resinous feel with effective but subtle carbonation for a perfectly drinkable and delicious porter. It obviously stands on its own but would pair well with cheese or other edibles for sure. Another beauty from Great Lakes!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Also get hints of chocolate and some sweet cream flavor.  m - Smooth and creamy medium body, with little carbonation.  d - I really enjoyed this porter. It had a great creamy coffee/chocolate taste that seemed to get better as I drank it and it warmed up.

It tasted of coffee, a touch of cream, some dark chocolate and a touch of hops in the background. As this warms the dark chocolate flavor tends to dominate, which is a good thing as far as I am concerned.  The mouthfeel was not too thick or too thin in my book. This glass went down pretty easy and I can see a good session of this fine porter on a cold winter's night.

73,226,MrDanno96,4.3,"I've been overlooking this brew for quite some time now and finally decided it was time to give it a try. I'm glad I did!  A: Pours just about pitch black, letting no light in even when held up to it. About a finger of tan head sits on top of the brew and tons of sticky lacing covers the glass.  S: An awesome mix of coffee, cream, vanilla, dark chocolate, and sweet malt. Very appealing.  T: Tastes like a nice dark roast coffee with sweetener in it. Dark chocolate and roasted malts are also apparent. I wish I could give a 4.25 here - it's quite tasty, but not quite a 4.5.  M: A nice robust porter the boarders on full body. It's impressively smooth for the style and finishes with just a slight bite of carbonation.  D: Honestly, this is one of the best porters I've ever had. A smooth brew with a good mix of coffee and malt flavors and a great nose. Also, at 5.8% abv it's fairly sessionable and could easily serve as a replacement for a RIS on a night you can't afford to be light-headed after one beer. I highly recommend trying this one.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,mklinger,4.07,"Poured into a shaker pint glass. A 1 finger head that was a nice mocha tan color and dissipated fairly quickly. Color is a dark brown that is really deep garnet red when held to the light. A very nice looking beer though head retention could be a bit better.  Aroma is chiefly chocolaty with just a smidge of alcohol in the nose. Maybe also a bit of coffee. The coffee/chocolate sweetness is very nice & appetizing.  Flavor is a bit more balanced than the aroma -- some chocolate/coffee/sweet flavor but they are all quite mild compared to the aroma. There's also a bit of hop bitterness in the flavor and a bit of carbonic bite. The chocolate caramel sweetness comes through better & better as more is drunk.  Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I expect from a highly rated porter. Also, I found it a bit overcarbonated. Decent drinkability. Goes down smoothly & easily. This is a really flavorful session strength porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BabyBastard,3.83,"Freshness date of 4/24/10. Poured into snifter semi-aggressively, yielding a small, tan head. Head is gone rather quickly, brew looks black at first, but then appears a very deep reddish black when gazed at near the light. Smell is of nice, dark and roasted malts. Coffee also pervades the nose. Taste is also heavy on the malt, dark chocolate and iced coffee smack the palate as well. Feels very smooth and creamy on the tongue. Not too heavy, just about the perfect body. A moderate alcohol content makes this a great brew to have a few of.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,alpinebryant,4.32,"Pouirs a dark black with some tint at the edges of a dark amber. large head from a less than agressive pour.  Smells of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, some light sweetness. Tasted very similar to aroma with first opinion of it being a well made robust porter. There is a little more sweetness than say a Smuttynose Robust Porter, but very similar in style, less black patent malt flavor, a miniscule amount of smoke, more chocolate malt flavors. Decent hop presence in this one, a slightly chalky / well attenuated finish. Overall a very good American Porter - especially so at a 5.8% abv. No abv is put to waste in making this beer taste great - Highly recommended to anyone who likes porters or stouts.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Smell: Smoked coffee beans, slightly milky.  Taste: Opens with subdued coffee and dark grains as a pleasant coffee sour emerges briefly as dark malts come in the end to finish the sip leaving a coffee and mildly malty aftertaste. The malts at the finish become more prominent as this warms up.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, slightly carbonated and medium bodied.  Drinkability: I would def have this again and recommend this to those who seek a solid porter who is nicely balanced with coffee as well as malts.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Some soapy lacing slides down the glass and some oily resin sticks on the glass telling me this one has a nice hop bill. Aroma is of coffee, some chocolate malt and some toasted malt. Taste is mildly sweet with obvious coffee and chocolate notes. Very, very smooth to drink, nothing off-putting whatsoever.

A: Nice deep brown with excellent garnet accents when held to the light, light tan head not quite a finger thick, but has decent retention. Very clear beer, the accents really pop on this one. Nice looking beer.  S: Roasted malts right up front followed behind by a note of coffee, brown sugar. Notes of dark fruits underneath, plums come to mind.  T: Definitely roasted, wow, this sucker has some strong coffee notes, a little caramel, and some brown sugar. A note of chocolate a little further back, and a nice bitterness from the roast and an earthy hop profile. Really focuses on the roast though. Decent, but not quite what I had in mind. Still very flavorful.  M: Medium body, pretty strong carbonation, slightly acidic in the mouth as well from the roasted malts/coffee profile.  D: Very easy to drink, this is one flavorful beer, and would make a great winter session. Maybe a little strong on the roast for a porter, a little more chocolate flavor would help to even things out. Regardless, this is a great beer and is not one to pass over.  Thanks Mark!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,natelocc787,4.2,"First thought is here is a Porter that combines all the characteristics a Porter could possibly contain. Roasted, bitter and burnt. Chocolate, cocoa nibs and coffee grounds. Vanilla, brown sugar and roasted graham. All these flavors hit you each time you raise the glass and play ping pong with your palate. Taste score may have achieved perfection with a better mouthfeel to complement it, as is the feel is good but doesn't achieve the silky, creamy smoothness of some other great Porters.

73,226,jrallen34,4.05,"I drank this from a 12oz bottle into my Rochefort chalice.  The beer pours black, not super black with a lot of brown in the light. There is a light mocha head that only rises about 1 finger and is gone quickly not leaving behind even a trace. There is poor lacing.  The aroma is super light. What does come through is a bitter chocolate with a smidge of alcohol.  The taste keeps in line with aroma as it is very light, but smooth and mostly in the flavor of light bitter chocolate.  The feel is on the lighter side but has nice sustaining taste.  With the low abv this is drinkable, but why not move on to something a litte more high powered.  Overall, this porter is ok, but doesn't live up to the hype, let alone me a top 100 beer. There are too many better, fuller more flavorful porters to keep drinking this. Having said that, getting a fixer at Whole Foods for $7.99 makes it a bargain, only if we rated that.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,drabmuh,4.38,"Served on tap into a pint glass. Beer is dark brown, can see through it at the corners and there is no haze. Carbonation is moderate and forms a thin brown head of tiny bubbles. The bubbles break and gravitate toward the edges where they leave an illogical amount of lacing on the glass. Beer looks awesome.  Aroma is simple, mixture of mild sweetness and roast. Its not unpleasant at all, just not a lot of it. Smells good enough to drink.  I'm usually not a fan of the porter style. I wouldn't list it in my top 10 styles, maybe not even the top 20, but this beer is amazing. Maybe I just haven't been drinking the right porters. Its sweet and completely smooth. Finishes without an aftertaste. Medium body and there is a roast character in the back of the palate that lingers (not as an aftertaste, just lingers).

S: Roasted malt, faint coffee, bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit...figs, and faint burnt caramel. Nice and complex.  T: Huge roasted malt and chocolate, coffee also comes through in a big way. Dark fruit is a little more subdued. Overall it is a nice flavor profile for porter, well balanced and smooth.  M: Very smooth, faint carbonation but it is present and does just enough to wake up your tastebuds. Medium to light body.  D: At 5.8% this is exactly where I would want a porter to be.

The beer is black with crimson around the sides.  Smell: Not much here other than a roasted coffee smell. Not much for the olfactory.  Taste: Classic porter: its rich toasted malts, hints of chocolate or coffee may come to mind. Consistent taste from first sip to last. Roasted dark chocolate taste hangs on for quite a while particularly at the soft palate.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is there to the bitter end. 30 minutes into my first glass and it still has consistent carbonation and a little foam on top.  Drinkability: Not bad for the style.

73,226,NittanyBeerFan,4.45,"This is quite simply one of the best porters that I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. I am reviewing it now, almost a year after I had it originally to make sure that I was not over-rating this beer based on my previously limited knowledge of porters. Anyway, enough banter...here goes.  A: Dark brown in color. Almost completely opaque, and in the middle of the glass, this beer is almost black. Held up to light, the edges lighten to a lighter brown, but there are no amber or ruby hues. The lacing is quite literally a solid wall of foam caked on the far side of my glass.  S: I let this one sit on the counter for about 10-15 minutes after removing it from the fridge before drinking. The initial aromas are of roasted malts and a nice bittersweet chocolate. Smoke is also present in limited quantities. I can also make out some licorice notes. Very deep and complex nose.  T: In the flavor, the smokiness of this beer is allowed to develop more fully. Smokey notes combine with roasted malts to give a nice rich character to the bittersweet chocolate that is still contributing nicely to the flavors. Coffee comes through fairly heavily in the finish and the aftertaste is that of a dark roasty coffee.  M/D: The feel of this beer is incredible. Smooth and silky, and yet, the carbonation content does not appear low. The texture of the beer is still fairly light. The mouthfeel follows the trend that this beer lays out from the beginning. Complex, well balanced, and not overpowering. Everything about this beer is enjoyable while staying subtle. This beer is a reminder that phenomenal beers do not have to be barrel aged, brewed with brettanomyces, or over 10% ABV. Very nicely done, Great Lakes.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

As head deflates there is sticky lacing left on the glass.  The moment I popped the bottle, the aroma of chocolate hit me in the face. Getting my nose in the glass and taking a deep whiff, it's like i'm smelling chocolate milk. I'm letting this beer warm up a little and roasted malts and a touch of smoke is now present.  Initial sip, I can taste some roasted malts, accompanying the finish is a little bitterness, almost like drinking black coffee. As this beer opens up I can taste more smoke in the finish.  The body on this beer feels light/ medium. This one has a good amount of carbonation. Goes down pretty smooth and clean.  This is my first beer from Great Lakes and I'm glad to have been able to try this one. This is a porter I could drink a few bottles of in a sitting.

Bitter/dark chocolate mixed with coffee flavors. Its fairly sweet and creamy but not at all unbalanced. The hops are present, but don't do anything to take attention away from the malt.  Mouthfeel- Very very smooth with a medium-thick body. Just enough carbonation.

73,226,Whiteweasel,4.27,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Drink by date was 1/25/10  Appearance: Deep black and reddish. Nice thick frothy head with big bubbles leaves good lacing on the sides. Not quite opaque but close.  Smell: Deep and very complex. Chocolately very much like a stout but with a much lighter yet still toasty malt composition. Roasted flavour is a little less prominant as is the case with the mocha scent. Very very appetizing.  Taste: Roasted flavour is very strong. Dark chocolate flavours abound. Strongly bittersweet taste from what seems to be roasted malt but also something like hops. Yeastiness is very subtle but still present in a limited capacity. Reminds me a little of a doppelbock, especially in terms of yeast character. Small amount of sweetness that helps to recalls fruit. Has a smokey character that I havent experienced much of. Some interesting complexities which I don't really have analogous flavours with which to compare.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy and pleasant. Booziness is hidden very skillfully, so while a little warmth is evident, there is no alcohol flavour. Not a huge amount of carbonation, which is very suitable for the style.  Drinkability: Very good. I could have many of these in a row simply based on taste. I feel like it would take many pints to really figure out and appreciate some of these interesting complexities.

TASTE is where this one really kicks up a notch or two, and that is a great area for a beer to be strong. Roasty, bitter chocolate (my mom took one sip and said ""mmmm, chocolate""), and some malty sweetness. Very smooth and balanced, if not amazingly complex. Extremely tasty.

Watery flavor upfront with a backend of roasty coffee and little hints of chocolate. Not bad, but not the best.  M: A little too much carbonation for my taste. Still very good.

This keg is actually a few months old, so some of the mild hops you'll get from a fresher batch have left the building.  Taste is exceptional.

It was like being near a fireplace, with charred wood, and billowy rising smoke from freshly added wood, and roasted almonds. Notes of freshly brewed coffee and bittersweet chocolate rippled through the smooth and balanced palate. As the beer aerated, a fresh hoppy aspect arose, which interestingly, was even more present the next day.  They suggest on their website pairing the Fitzgerald with BBQ ribs, which I think is a brilliant match, and I would add to that any other grilled, smoky foods. Remember guys, match like with like.

A leafy hoppiness asserts itself right away, becoming lightly citrusy toward the finish.

T- My first sip reminded me of the flavor of the thin brown sauce you put on Chinese pot stickers. I never realized that stuff is so malty.

73,226,Hojaminbag,4.5,"NOTE: Looking at my first review of Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter (which was my second review ever, I decided that I needed a new one. Since the original was on-tap and this one is bottled, I now have two reviews.  Edmund Fitzgerald is a mahogany color with red hues around the edges. The head is about two fingers thick, is a light brown color and has a decent retention. Rings of solid lacing are left behind.  The aroma is very good, featuring some dark fruit, roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and even a bit of hops.  After trying this beer so many times, I'm not sure what made me look at my review of it, but I am glad I did because this is a well-crafted, balanced and excellent porter. At first there is a big, sweet flavor that has a bit of caramel and plenty chocolate to it, but also a sweet dark cherry flavor. Just a bit of cherry. After that a little bit of slightly bitter, grapefruit-flavored hops kick in, followed by roasted malts and coffee flavors that come in no short supply. Edmund Fitzgerald has a little bit of everything as far as porters go.  Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Basically, right on for the style.  This one is scary it goes down so well.

T - Chocolate & coffee are immediately apparent with a lively hoppy bite quickly following. Though the hops seemed underplayed in the nose, here they offer greater character & complexity without being overly bitter or obtrusive. Hints of caramel & roasted malts are in the background. A smokiness is present throughout.  M - Rather full-bodied with just enough carbonation to keep things interesting.

If you hold it up to the light (which you should...) you'll see just a tiny bit of red poking around at the edges - but it's the most beautiful garnet you'll see. Nice quarter inch of rich, dense, foam the color of cappuccino foam. Dissipates and leaves nice lacing.  Rich, dense roasted malts. A touch of coffee (...I'm noticing a theme) and dark chocolate. Hops hidden well, as they should be.  Yum! Tasty bitter dark coffee beans - not brewed - and bitter chocolate beans. It's great that it has such a bitter quality from the malts. Some toast and other flavors I attribute to the malliard reaction from toasted ingredients. Really, really enjoyable.  Nice smooth mouthfeel - light carbonation balances with the full, but delicate, mouthfeel. Refreshing and delicious.  Try this beer. There's not much of another way to say it. It's a high quality brew at a very reasonable price. One of the top porters.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,billab914,4.32,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish shaped pint glass. Poured with a thick tan head that quickly dissipated to a halo that stuck to the sides of the glass.  Aroma has a lot of roasty malts and some chocolaty sweetness. Taste starts off with the roasted malty sweetness but I also get a nice smokey and some bitter sweet chocolaty flavor as well. Medium bodies with moderate carbonation.  Very tasty overall, I've had this beer several times and each time I'm impressed. Would definitely buy again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ThreeWiseMen,4.14,"Got this as a gift from Solomon420. Thanks Damian!  ""Enjoy by 12/09/09"" bottle poured into a standard pint glass.  Appearance: Normal pour yielded a few millimeters of tan foam that dissipated to a thin halo fairly quickly. Not much lacing. Body is a matte brown color in the shade, but turns bright crimson when held to light. Very purdy colors.  Smell: Roasted malt and a handful of whole grains greet the nostrils. Light coffee and dark chocolate aromas are also in there, but this nose is all about those whole grains. Leafy hops peak through the back. Smells very well-crafted and balanced.  Taste: The taste started out pretty harsh with big roasted malt upfront and a combination of lemon, salt, and hop bitterness in the finish. It was very disjointed. With time, however, this all smoothed out. Roasted malt still played the lead role, but coffee and milk chocolate appeared in the middle and the lemony flavor slowly fell out all together. A lot of salt and roastiness in the aftertaste, along with some very assertive hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Actively carbonated and prickly with a fairly light (but overall closer to medium) body. A tad creamy when swished. Feels like I like a porter to feel.  Drinkability: This beer didn't start out too hot, but it got smoother and tastier throughout the session. There are better porters out there, but this is a solid representative for the style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,robbyc1,4.1,"On draft at the Glenview YardHouse, served in a pint glass, a bit too cold.  Deep chocolate black look, small tan head, just fine.  Smell has a deep chocolate nose, very roasty, fresh and good.  This porter has a deep lasting chocolate flavor that is not sweet, finishes balanced, and carries the esthers well. Very good with dessert.  Soft and silky mouthfeel, heavy and good. Drinkable as a session beer, maybe one of the best porters out there.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,cassanoj,4.02,"Poured into a wine glass. Black without many bubbles. Roasted malty head. Some seriously sticky lacing.  Smells smokey. Also dark chocolate and coffee. I get a bit of sweet fruit.  Tastes real malty. A lot of the smell carries through, chocolate, coffee, smokey. Also some bitterness from a dash of hops.  Mouthfeel is bittersweet. A bit bubbly and the body is relatively thin.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Deep, rich taste w/ hoppy background. Rather dry. Coffee, bittersweet chocolate.  M- Hoppy, very smooth but rich.  D- Awesome stuff. I was thrilled when this came to Philadelphia. Very enjoyable. Search it out. You won't be dissapointed.  Happy Holidays!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,dudemuskie,4.2,"Appearance- very deep brown, almost black, and nearly opaque. A light brown almost cocoa powder colored 1 inch head develops and sticks around for about 10 minutes. No lacing from the tight almost creamy head.  Aroma- nice roasty notes, chocolate, and hints of coffee. Malt character dominates aroma though some earthy hops, smokiness, and fruity esters also peek through up front.  Flavor- malt forward with loads of dark specialty malt flavors of bittersweet chocolate and medium roast coffee. Earthy hops present but very much in the back seat. Persistent chocolate and coffee aftertaste with notes of bittersweet chocolate and a light smokiness as it warms. Very subtle breath of alcohol present, but not hot or astringent.  Mouthfeel- medium bodied, moderate carbonation with a slightly drying finish. Nice and chewy but not overwhelming. Low to moderate residual sweetness.  Overall- wonderfully drinkable for such a dark beer with a nice balance between earthy hops and bittersweet malt. Dark roasted specialty malts shine in this brew and leave a great chewy chocolate/coffee aftertaste. This brew is best as it warms and if you dont believe there are hops in it just wait until the first burp! Another winner from GLBC!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,rhinos00,4.38,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A- Pours a dark, chocolate brown with a ruby hues when held into light. Produced three fingers width of off-white colored head. Good head retention. Reduced to a film throughout consumption. Some lacing as well.  S- Cookie dough, roasted malts and milk chocolate. Nothing overpowering, just good.  T- Getting a slight hop character along with some sweet, chocolate bitterness. As the taste progresses, a milk chocolate character comes into play (thanks to the mouthfeel) and finishes with a distinct roasted malt flavor.  M- For a beer this sessionable, the mouthfeel was unrivaled. Light bodied, yet had a creamy, full feel to it. Plenty of carbonation. Just amazing.  D- About as easy drinking as a porter gets.

73,226,GilGarp,4.61,"Best before 1/17/2010  Served cold in a shaker pint glass. It pours a dark redish brown color with very good clarity. Even in the glass, I can see through the darkness. The thick and creamy bone colored head sticks around quite a while and leaves excellent lacing behind.  Aroma is pleasant with subtle roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Emphasis on the subtle - this isn't a beer that carries a strong smell.  Flavor is excellent with great dark roasted malts, french press coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate, and toffee. The sweetness is perfectly balanced by bitter black malt and light hopping. There is a slight earthy/grassy character that I remember from long ago. It's unique and enjoyable.  Body is medium-light (lighter than expected) and carbonation is perfect.  One of my old favorites from when I lived in Ohio. Now, sadly I have to trade for it. Thanks to BuckeyeNation!  Such a good beer. In fact, I can think of very few bottled porters that even come close. The only way one could make this better is by puting it on nitro!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,cavedave,4.6,"A gentle pour coddles a thick, dark-chestnut-brown, beauty of a brew into the glass. Atop luxuriates a one finger head of beige. It recedes languidly to a whisk of a cap, and leaves coriolis ejections of lace. Tempting look.  The nose is a medium aroma of sweet toasty malt, hints of chocolate, dark bread, and light yeast, with a lighter edge of bitter and burnt that blends the bouquet into a scent of dark, clean beauty. Nice. One of the best aromas on a porter this nose knows.  The flavor of this is a joy, but it is the mouthfeel that takes the exceptional flavor a step beyond. It is a perfect balance of light and airy sweet, with dark (toasty, burnt) notes, and intricately dank flavors (bakers chocolate, espresso, bitter herbosity) that combine through the perfection of a just-perfectly-light-enough mouthfeel (like the perfect spotlight accurately lighting the perfect stage performance) into a flavor that defies proper accolades. I have exclaimed, ""Mmmm..."" after many sips.  Rated for style I have no choice but to give this a 5 for mouthfeel. Every aspect here combines to give this porter the perfect taste and perfect finish. I wish I had the skill to brew this.  Drinkability also is beyond hyperbole here. It is the most refreshing, delicious porter. The fact that it is now readily available here makes me happy.  Hope to taste a better one than this. Doubt I will. Get it if you can. Thanks Great Lakes.

73,226,Mistofminn,4.44,"Been meaning to try this one for a while. Big thanks to auroracrisis for throwing in an entire 6 pack of this (yea, thats right, entire 6 pack)...completely above and beyond. Thanks a bunch Ben!  Pours a dark brown, where light is only visible on the far outside edge of the deep murky brown liquid. Nice one finger light tan head produced on the pour. Leaves a little bit of lacing here and there. Nice slow laboring carbonation is continuous throughout the life of the beer.  The taste is lightly toasted barley and other malts, with a light chocolaty flavor. Overall, thats about all thats going on and I was expecting just a little bit more. Fortunately for this brew, it's enough to make is very appealing.  The taste is very similar to the nose, if not slightly more subdued and subtle. It's just kind of watered down and almost disappointing. It's not bad, by any stretch of the imagination, it's actually a very tasty porter. However, considering the status this beer gets, I was expecting a much more complex and enjoyable brew.  Mouthfeel is light to medium with a low appropriate carbonation level. Sort of thin. Drinkability is pretty good.  Overall, a solid porter. One of the best beers in the world? Eh...probably not. One of the best porters out there? Definitely. Good stuff and I'll gladly enjoy the rest of the 6 pack. Thanks again Ben for the chance.  ---  Update 1/30/2009  I had this again tonight and had a much different experience. Maybe the two months in the fridge made this a much better porter, I don't know.  I got a ton of coffee notes in the nose, something I don't think I picked up on at all before. I really really enjoyed the nose this time. The taste also was better, with a lighter (but still noticeable) coffee flavor.  Maybe I got a better bottle or maybe my palate has changed in the past two months, but regardless, I enjoyed this a lot more than last time. Upped my score accordingly.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S - lots of fresh coffee immediately cut into by some chocolate...milk chocolate, smells a bit like a Hershey's kiss. more sweetness and roasted malts near the end.  T - bitter coffee right off the bat, slowly...very slowly the sweetness chimes in. milk chocolate, very nice roastiness near the back of the tongue. every few sips there's an insane amount of sweetness in the front of the tongue...almost like cane sugar.  M - quite bubbly...a bit to a fault. everything else in the feel though is spot on...nice and thick, syrupy.

It's not burnt or charred, just darkly roasted. Little hints of coffee and chocolate, but mostly toasted dark bread. Taste is equally roasted, toasted, and malty.

There is a one finger off-white head that fades to a tight ring around the glass, leaving a slight foamy lacing.  The smell is subdued milk chocolate and bitter coffee with a slight earthy hop aroma.  The flavor is milk chocolate, burnt coffee and traces of cola sweetness. There is a grassy, earthy hop that balances the flavor and finishes the flavor with a nice balance.  The beer is medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. The abv is low and the flavors are well balanced, making this a very sessionable brew.

Cookie, milk chocolate and toasted nut aromas. Average hops on the nose.  T: Slight, leathery yeast present. Bit of coffee. Bit of flat cola. The aromas come through on the palate as well.  M: Full bodied, creamy and pretty sticky. The carbonation was lively & fizzy but maybe just a little more than I wanted in a porter.  D: I thought this was a geat porter.

Taste - nice coffee and chocolate up front, and then a mild bitter finish with malts. Nicely satisfying with every sip.  Mouthfeel - thick with no carbonation on the tongue, but slick enough to go down smooth.  Drinkability - I easily could have had another one of these, and it went fantastic with the meal (meatloaf).

Minimal head and poor head retention leaves only a ring around the top of the beer, however it laces nicely  S: Nice chocolate aroma along with some toffee, breadiness  T: The first sip is a mix of the breadiness and some chocolate. To me it drinks much more like a brown ale. Good amount of sweetness with enough bitterness to balance it out. As it warmed, a slightly more roasted flavor came out.  M: Good amount of body for a session porter, flavors are slightly subdued and there is a bit of graininess, I wonder if I sat on the bottle too long  D: It is solid and worth going back to as a regular beer, but i am not sure if I would really go out of my way to get it",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,swizzlenuts,4.22,"I poured this beer into a nice pint glass with a tiny bit of head. The head quickly diminished, but the deep brown, almost black colour looks absolutely beautiful. Even while I was pouring I could smell the slight roastiness and dark malts. When I actually put my nose near it and take a whiff, the aroma is fantastic. A bit of chocolate comes through with a mild roastiness. There is also a caramel sweetness undertone that is delightful. The balance of the caramel sweetness and chocolate is absolutely perfect.  Taking a nice sip of the beer gives a huge bite of carbonation followed by an absurd amount of flavours. It ranges from a smokey roast to a bitter black metal flavour to a bitter sweet chocolate bar. The flavours are fantastic. Holy shit is this beer drinkable.  I think if they cut the carbonation down just a slight bit, the beers flavour would shine a lot more.

Moderate carbonation. Decent tan head that dropped down to a nice cap.  S - This is where it really starts to shine in comparison to some other porters. Lots of roasty malts, dark chocolate, a slight amount of toffee and some light hops.  T - The taste is just a perfect confirmation of the nose. Roasty(enough that there's a slight sharpness), chocolate, from dark to something less bitter. I think the chocolate flavor is slightly more milky than it seems because there's a fair amount of bitterness backing it from the roasted malt itself and from the hops, which come through after a few seconds.  MF - It has a nice fullness to it and is a bit silky. There's a pretty decent amount of carbonation, which keeps things lively.  D - Great. It could go great with some food because it has enough flavor to stand up to a lot of stuff, but it's just awesome by itself.

There is a sweetness that I generally find in milk stouts, but was quite a pleasant surprise.  T: The flavors are pretty much right on target with the nose. A great sweetness and tons of chocolate come through first. The roasted malt and coffee follow those up and provide a somewhat bitter finish.  M: The body is on the fuller side of medium, with moderate carbonation, and nice creamy mouthfeel.  D: I'm glad I was able to pick this one up.

73,226,Metalmonk,4.1,"Thanks to kels for this bottle...one of the few ""Best of BA"" beers under 6%! Curious to see what all the fuss is about, not being barrel-aged, imperialized and/or ridiculously rare...  Pouring this out one day after the 10/27/09 ""enjoy by"" date (full disclosure), it's a murky, opaque dark brown...as dark as brown gets before becoming black. Shot through with a glimmering ruby hue. Head is on the thin side and retains for several minutes before thinning to a crown. Looks nice though, a light toasty tan shade.  Aroma is big and bright--has a milky sweetness first, then a more bitter dark chocolate element arrives. Some dark fruit as well, and a ghost of freshly-ground gourmet coffee in the background.  Coffee becomes prominent in the flavor. Smoke and the bitterness of dark chocolate--even the nearly unpleasant bitterness of raw baking chocolate--push through. Even some hop bitterness pushes through, although that's kept in check. Mild notes of soy milk (ie. more nutty than sweet) and dark fruit even further back. Everything is very well-balanced, with the coffee element coming off nicely and not overpowering anything else. Bitterness/roast is met with a hit of tartness in the finish. Interesting.  As I'm finding with all the Great Lakes stuff, it feels just as good as it tastes. A real slick texture is propped up by moderate carbonation and a balancing creaminess. Like the flavor, nothing mindblowing, but something very well balanced.  I would dare to say Edmund Fitzgerald (the beer, not the ship) is a little over-hyped, though it's clearly one very good porter. I sat and sat with it wondering if it was ever gonna push through my own personal Top 100, but I'm not tasting anything that would place it there.

Flavor is complex, bitter sweet chocolate notes up front, next in line is vanilla with coffee and salt in the background. All of these flavors work perfectly with the bitterness from the hops and roasted malt, a very good balance.  Mouth is medium full, smooth, rich and creamy. No bite from the hops or roast.

Satisfies the taste buds, but does not fill you up due to the low alcohol content.  Hats off to great lakes. This is the only dark beer I've had that satisfies me like an RIS, but lacks all the alcohol. An excellent sipper when you want all the flavor but don't want to get drunk. I can sip on these all night....and I just might...",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Strix,4.33,"Poured dark brown with a decent head.  Smell is full of roasted goodness.  Roasted malt is the predominant flavor, but I get notes of cocoa, charcoal, and cola. Fairly complex, and also balanced.  Nice smooth mouthfeel, medium consistency.  I have been consistently impressed by Great Lakes, and this was no exception. This is exactly what a porter should be.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,alkemy,4.33,"Very dark brown pour, almost a ruby/mahogany when held to direct light. Coffee and chocolate scents are most notable. Also some roasted nuttiness with smoky overtones. I really like the smoky coffee flavor that dominates. The sweetness is similiar to burnt/caramelized sugar. Just enough bitterness provided by the hops for a surprisingly crisp finish. I really enjoyed the bitter finish of this. Pretty low ABV allowing you to session this through multiple football games.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,OnThenIn,4.28,"Appearance: This a beautiful beer. It poured with two fingers of a wonderful dark tan head and after dying down to one finger has maintained its fierce presence. It has left monstrous lacing and is a jet fuel black color unless it is shined directly into light at the edge of the glass, then it appears a rich mahogany color.  Smell: The nose is dominated by the roasted malt smell of rich black coffee. Upon digging deeper, I was able to find some sweeter, molasses like aroma, which complemented the coffee perfectly. Just god damn wonderful.  Taste: The roasted malt bitterness takes over the palate from the beginning and the smokeyness nicely complements the finish. There is some coffee and chocolate in the flavor as well. Nice. There is even a little sweet malt to this beer as it warms up.  Mouthfeel: The beer is light to medium bodied and finishes really clean. It is just really nice and drinkable. The carbonation was a little bit light.  Drinkability: This is a very solid and drinkable beer. I have really enjoyed this one. It is definitely a go to porter, especially considering the price. I shall definitely pick this up again. Something that I actually enjoyed the thinner mouthfeel when it came to drinkability (even though that's not what I go for when it comes to mouthfeel).",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,cvfish,4.88,"A - This beer poured a dark brown color with ruby highlights that produced a fluffy tan head that had great retention and laced the side of the glass very nicely  S - The aromas produced by this beer were a mixed bag of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee, with a surprise hint of cinnamon spice  T - The taste of this beer is phenomenal, rich dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, and bit of coffee, I can't say enough about this beer, it's clearly one of my favorites  M - The mouthfeel of this beer had a medium body with a light to moderate amount of carbonation  D - This is probably the best Porter out there, a style that I have begun to love, and this one is one that will get a clone as soon as I start homebrewing",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ABHatter,4.1,"Picked up a few singles of this at the Foodery in Philadelphia back in August. Best before 12-26-09)  Poured from a 12oz. btl into my Long Trail Tumbler. Pours a reddish dark brown color with an extremely small coffee ice cream colored head which vanishes very rapidly.  The smell is very nice with lots of roasted malts, bitter chocolate, A touch of Molasses with a unique smokey quality to it.  The taste is a lot like the smell, Bitter chocolate, Mild coffee, Smokey roasted malts with a nice hop balance which mingles well with the chocolatey sweetness. Mouthfeel is sensational due to the great balance. Carbonation seemed a little low which contributed to the nice creamy mouthfeel.  Drinkability is superb, I could easily drink several of these anytime of the year. Overall this is a top notch porter, Not overally complex but surely one of the best porters that I have had.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,dstc,4.4,Pours a midnight black with a foamy tan head. Head is slow to fall. Nice lace.  Big roasted malt aroma.  Sweet malt in the taste. Chocolates and roasted coffee flavor.

Very good brew.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jlindros,4.13,"This beer is brought to me in part by BEERchitect and Tyson and this review is sponsored by readers like you. Without you the reader and beer sponsors, this review would not be possible nor would it exist. Now on with the regularly schedule review.  A: Pours with a nice head with lacing that has a slightly brown tinge and large bubbles throughout. It provides a nice covering over the beer that slowly dissipates. This thing is pitch black, no light coming through there, it won't even thin at the bottom of the glass no matter how much I beg it.  N: Great nose, loaded with roasted malts and chocolate, as well as some coffee and slight dark fruit. A creamy stout effervescence and touch of oats add a nice touch to it but is it really a porter, or a stout, or are those one in the same? I don't want to start that debate again, so I'll just start tasting.  T: Mmmhhmm, just as I suspected, a great porter/stout taste. Some light oatmeal and creamy stout taste make way for a strong bakers chocolate blended with some milk chocolate and coffee. Lots of roasted malts and some earthy char. It's got a nice spicey quality as well, not from the alcohol since that's really low and no alcohol taste. Some light taste of dark dried fruits and stout bitterness round it off. It is a little on the sweet side though and that seems to shave a few points off as it starts to get more and more sweet as I sip it that almost becomes overbearing towards the end.  M: Pretty thick and creamy with low carbonation and slightly spicey. The spice just pokes its head and tickles the tongue then disappears.  F: A dry Irish stout taste finishes up the taste as well as more roasted and chocolate tastes. The sweet start it had really dried off on the finish. The earthy charred roasted malt taste really comes out on the tongue and helps the finish. As I swallow its got a nice chocolate milk taste with touch of coffee. More bakers chocolate finishes it up with a nice touch and then it clears off the palate leaving it beat up but wanting more. The low alcohol content really turns up the drinkability.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,cudmud,4.36,"The beer has a rich, ruby-clear color. No head or lace in this sample.  This beer has amazing aromas of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts.  As with the smell, this beer packs a wallop of coffee and chocolate flavors. The malts are complex and tasty. Next, the hops balance the malts.  The mouthfeel is good. Perhaps a little too much carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is great, and I could drink this beer all night.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ClevoPiwo,4.4,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle in a snifter. The color is an extremely dark brown, nearly black. However, it does let some light through when back lit exhibiting some nice dark amber highlights. The head is pretty good, about a finger's width or more and left some lacing as it dissipated down.  The smell is big and malty. Tons of roasted malt and coffee along with some sweeter hints of caramel or vanilla in the background. Just an overall big and complex aroma with lots of roasted malt complimented by some sweetness.  The taste is just as complex as the smell. Big roasted malt flavors up front and throughout the entire experience with some sweeter hints of dark fruit poking in here and there. The aftertaste is pleasant and malty with some hints of coffee bitterness.  This is hands down the best porter I've had yet. The mouth feel is big, but not quite as big as a stout.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,dpodratsky3,4.8,"Attained by way of BEERchitect (thanks man!)  12 oz bottle poured into pint glass  A: Dark brown that you can't see through, but you can tell isn't hiding any clarity issues. Just a tad lighter than black coffee. The head is nice and about 2 fingers tall after a good hard pour.  S: Malty, but with a distinct coffee note. The sweetness comes through in the aroma. A touch of hops in the end too.  T: When I took my first sip I literally said, ""Wow chocolate coffee"". Those are the main flavors that come through. Very tasty. There is a bitterness that comes out too, but more in a coffee way than a hop taste. The aftertaste is the only real hoppy flavors that come through. A delicious porter.  M: Surprisingly light and clean feeling. Very pleasant.  D: Not heavy, but with amazing dark flavor. The easiest drinking dark beer I've had.  Notes: Once again, my pursuit of Great Lakes brews has not let me down. In fact this one surpassed my expectations. After reading many of Buckeye's reviews (as I'm sure many have) of GL I knew I had to try them. I agree with his assessment of this one in particular.

Nice dense head leaves nice lacing all over as it subsides to a film reminiscent of the film on a cup of hot chocolate.  S- Really yummy. Chocolate, creamy, rich and sweet.  T- Smokey, chocolate, caramel, some slight hoppy bite at the end serves to perfectly balance this porter.  M- medium body, somewhat dry finish, not sticky and it has very little after taste.  D- Great session beer. I can drink a couple in a row. The slight heaviness make it harder to have more than that for me.  This is the best porter Ive had the pleasure to taste.

73,226,portia99,4.27,"12oz bottle (best before 01/04/10) received in trade with brokenleadedcask. Thanks! Poured into a Portsmouth goblet.  A - Pours a really dark and mostly opaque brown, almost black color. A one finger of loose bubbled, bordering on soda-like head forms and dissipates very quickly, leaving a thin and uneven layer of bubbles on the surface and a thin collar. No lacing.  S - Dark and roasty aromas abound. Combination of bakers chocolate, a little bit of coffee, some smokiness, some woody character, and burnt toast. Not getting any hops here, but it isn't a detractor either. Very good smelling porter.  T - Roasted and toasted flavors...smokey, barbeque like burnt flavors, burnt toast, dark roasted malts, bakers chocolate. Just a hint of sweetness (burnt caramel?)...some hop bitterness added in, but not much character, just more bitterness. Quite interesting...and very good. Haven't had another porter with this level of character.  M - Mouthfeel is thinner than I would have expected...a touch on the watery side. Carbonation is medium - prickly and tingly on the tongue. Roasted flavors linger forever after the swallow.  D - This is quite a drinkable porter. Great roasted flavors, light in body, very smooth going down. Seems like a great beer for food. The smokey and roasty flavors would complement nicely.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,StarlightSeraph,4.15,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my New Belgium globe glass.  Appearance: Pours reddish-brown with a finger and a half of off-white, slightly brown head. Some definite red can be seen when the glass is held up to the light. Lots of lacing. The head lingered for a long time.  Smell: Bitter roasted malts, but nicely balanced by a malt sweetness. Almost a burnt coffee scent in the background.  Taste: Heavy on the bitter, roasted malts/coffee flavors. A slight sweetness in the end. The bitterness lingers for awhile in the aftertaste. Not the most complex beer, but the flavor is bold and strong.  Mouthfeel: Nice and creamy, and good carbonation.  Drinkability: Excellent porter. It's one I really enjoy, and it goes down smooth.

A brownish cream-colored somewhat persistent two finger head crowns the brew.  S: Quite aromatic and pleasing... lots of burnt and sweet malt scents, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, and a touch of hops.  T: Matches the nose, though the hops is much more apparent, and quite a nice balance, though a hair on the hoppy side, which is great! Finish is long and satisfying.

When I raised the glass to my nose I was hit with a big whiff of roasted malts, a hint of smokiness, and rich dark chocolate. A very inviting, delicious smelling beer.  The taste opens up with big roasted malts which blend perfectly with bittersweet chocolate and caramel followed by a smokey, lingering aftertaste. The smooth medium/full body and light carbonation complement the big robust flavors of the beer nicely.

73,226,allboutbierge,4.25,"A beer that Ive had so many times, its a shame its taken me this long to get out a review.  Charcoal color, off white/beige head, moderate lace retention. Sweet is bittersweet in the nose. Doesn't hit very deep in the nose, rather upfront. Some resonance of roastiness remains.  Flavor isn't as roasty as one would expect from the aroma. Flavor is just a bittersweet and this bittersweet element hangs around in the aftertaste and comes back in the beer burps. Yes, I operate under the opinion that the flavor of the beer burp is part of the tasting experience. Some tangy sourness in there too, but its minimal. No diactyl. Body is neither overbearingly heavy nor chewy. It goes great with fast food or beef or mexican food (outside of chicken dishes).",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Mouthfeel is really quite splendid. Perfect balance on the palate. Generally better on tap than from bottle, but not always. NIcely carbonated, crisp and light yet carries a some viscosity. Yum.

73,226,mothman,4.03,"Best by 11/15/09 Poured into Sam Adams Sensory Glass  Pours almost 2 fingers of slightly tanned head. Ok head retention leaving some lace rings and splattered lace. Color is a dark caramel copper brown. 4.0  Aroma: Huge roasted malt profile along with some chocolate and coffee. Very smoky. It isn't as big as the taste turns out to be which is weird.  Taste: Just as the bottle states, this beer is bittersweet. A big roasted malt taste is right up front with the same notes from the aroma of chocolate and coffee. This beer packs a lot of flavor and reminds me a lot of a stout for how big it is. I really enjoy the coffee notes. This porter deserves a 4.5 here.  Mouthfeel: A little crisp, but mainly silky and creamy. Full bodied with a high amount of carbonation. Ends with a big malty and coffee flavored aftertaste. Fairly clean as well.  Overall, I am really enjoying this beer. It packs a lot of flavor that most porters don't do. It is rather filling though, so this bottle may be enough for me. I would definitely love having access to this one. Well done.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Brenden,4.2,"There's very little difference on tap. I think about all is that the sticky head is a little shorter and leaves just a little less lacing and there's slightly less in the mouthfeel.  This one pours almost black with reddish-brown hues. The head is about one finger, tan, very thick and foamy with some nice retention. Sticky lacing is just a bit less impressive on tapl. The smell is dark chocolate, caramel malts and hops. The taste is toasty caramelized sugar and dark chocolate balanced by bitter hops. There's a nice smoky undertone as well. This one is full-bodied with a great malty thickness. The finish is dry and leaves a mix of sweet and bitter on the tongue. Nice and complex.  This is simply a great porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Florida9,4.03,"A: Served in a pint glass with a mere finger of creamy, light tan head. Extremely dark brown in color, but still translucent, with some reddish-brown light poking through the edges.  S: Dark roasted malt, coffee, and some light chocolate. Maybe a little peat or toast as well.  T: Opens with a strong, bitter bite of well roasted malts followed by a mild malty sweetness, then moves on to the long finish of black coffee.  M: Medium-heavy in weight. Lower carb levels. Sweetness hangs on the tongue.  D: A good porter. I imagine it would pair well with certain cheeses.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,schinebd,4.35,"A - A dark beer with some faint red highlights and a thin brown bubbly head that retains.  S - Smells like chocolate with some minor hop smell underneath.  T - Follows the smell - but the first sip is a shocker. The flavor explodes like a bomb with big chocolate malt flavor up front that fades away to mild hop bitterness. The deep malt flavor playing off of the hops really gives this beer a great character. Brewed under the German purity laws? Impressive!  M - Love the way the carbonation makes the flavor pop. Though the beer is slightly watery, the way the flavors stick in the mouth long after sipping compensate. As the beer warms, the mouthfeel thickens and the flavors become more pronounced.  D - Easy to get if you live in the right area (which I unfortunately don't), and with the low ABV make, this an easy and delicious drink. The bitter hop finish dries off the tongue and makes you want to take another sip.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,crossovert,4.35,"Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald, in a 12 oz bottle with the ship painted on the label. Brewed under the Bavarian purity law, nice. Says it is a world champion gold medal winner, nice. Served at about 45 but ill let it cool down some more before tasting.  Pours with a nice, thick 2 finger caramel colored, sandy looking head. Leaves some amazing lacing as it dissipates in due time. The beer's color is dark and rich with shimmers of ruby/brown near the edges and when held to light.  Smell is heavily, heavily of dark roasted coffee. A bit of bittersweet dark cacao lingers over the top. A fine scented beer.  Nice mouthfeel, it is on the watery side but it is also creamy and smooth which works well with these heavy flavors, and the carbonation is spot on. Flavor is of bittersweet chocolate coffee. Nice and robust. Has a little bit of sourness I typically seem to find in American porters, and a nice sweetness. Slight hop in the finish (this seems to be what this brew is known for). No alcohol present making it higher than normal drinkablity-wise for an American porter.

73,226,movingtrain,4.05,"12 ounce bottle poured into a Great Lakes pint glass.  Excellent lacing on the glass...pours a nice, dark brownish-black with a bit of redness around the edges when the light hits it.  Smells like a porter...chocolate, some vanilla, burnt wood, dark malts, coffee.  The flavor is along the same lines...chocolate, coffee, vanilla...a real sweet flavor here, but not overly sweet...it is balanced well with some hoppy bitterness in the back.  Overall, this is a strong porter...one I could drink many of and not get tired of it. It is standard, but maybe a bit more body and chocolaty character than most English porters. It's an American micro, right? So why not pump it up a bit. Anyway, this beer tastes great, is relatively true to style, and stands out as a solid porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,TheTrevor,4.2,This beer poured a very dark brown with a barely perceptible auburn tinge and a small dark head. The smell is mostly some deeply roasted malts with some melted chocolate and caramel notes. The taste starts off with some molasses that gives way to some mocha while avoiding some of the bitterness normally inherent in the style and making for a lighter beer than you would expect from the look of the beer. The mouthfeel is satisfyingly thick and chewy with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a great version of the style that doesn't necessarily stick to the strict formula but still manages to maintain enough hallmarks of the style to be a good interpretation of it.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,WalrusJockey,4.25,"A- thick, dark, nearly opaque, with a heavy, thick, creamy faun colored head.  S- very heavy, sweet, roasty malt aromas, with coffee and caramel aromas at the fore but many other rich smells very strongly present.  T- shockingly fresh, light, almost fruity flavors cascade over the palate, gradually giving way to smooth roasted flavors of cacao, coffee and a hint of smoke. Swallow is very clean, and the aftertaste is subtle, but lingering, and satisfyingly bitter.  M- much, much lighter than I expected from the nose and the appearance; still very rich and creamy, but not nearly as heavy as an RIS, though before the sip it might be mistaken for one.  D- beers this roasty I can't drink too many of, or too frequently, but this is pretty great. For the style, and for me, this is pretty drinkable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Reaper16,4.33,"12oz. bottle served into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass  Pours a dark brown like milk chocolate, though the top and bottom of the beer takes on a reddish, chestnut hue when held up to light. An tentative pour still yielded an impressive, 2 1/2 finger head. Lacing is spectacular; thick and bubbly all around the glass.  This porter is front-loaded with coffee aroma. It doesn't take on any artificial coffee-syrup aromas, either; very pleasant. Some chocolate malt, of course, shows through. What excites me the most is the faint grassiness that I am attributing to an honest presence of hops. I absolutely love hops in my porters -- as evidenced by how much I consume Boulevard's Bully! Porter -- so that earthy hop smell does wonders for this beer as far as I am concerned.  I will say upfront that this is a fabulous porter. It has roasted chocolate malt flavor in spades and is tempered by clean coffee tastes. What I mean by that is the coffee flavor doesn't exactly have the harsh, roasted bean quality that you may expect. The quality of the coffee reminds me of Schlafly Coffee Stout. All told, this is malty in the ways that you expect porters to be. But the hops definitely assert themselves. There is a legitimate citrus element to Edmund Fitzgerald in the middle of the drink. The earthiness from the nose didn't quite follow to the palate (if it did, I think that the roasted chocolate malt tastes are masking it). One of the more remarkable aspects of this beer is the relative lack of bitterness. There is only a tiny trace of bitter aftertaste. Given all of the chocolate & coffee, not to mention the hops, I expected more. Given that I really enjoy that kind of bitterness, its exclusion is a bit of a disappointment.  That smooth, not-bittler aftertaste does make for a very drinkable beer. This is the kind of porter that you can get down on for an entire evening. The mouthfeel seems pretty good. Its not too thick at all, which helps keep this beer firmly in the porter camp as opposed to the stout one.  I had a lot of expectations for this porter. Ultimately, this beer didn't supplant Bully! Porter as my favorite beer of the style. Bully! Porter has a lot of roasty bitterness and contrasting hop bitterness in addition to a similar malty taste profile. So while Edmund Fitzgerald is less complex, it is a very, very fine example of the style on its own right. This review may be tinged with disappointment, but the truth of the matter is that this porter is one of the best. If Great Lakes would be so kind as to distribute to Missouri, then I would buy this semi-regularly.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,beerwolf77,4.45,"A hum the tune of the great song that goes with this beer as I pour it into my pint glass. Dark dark brown almost black but, some red can be seen when held to the window. Nice cap of mocha colored head rest gently on top of my glass. After sinking (oh bad choice of words) there is a fair amount of beige lace sticking to all sides of the glass. The aroma is coffee and caramel. roast malt and a hint of hops. The flavor is fantastic. Coffee, malt, vanilla, and a nice sharp hop bite to round things off.

A: Pours dark brown with a deep red tint when held to the light. Leaves off-white head that clears quickly. Full lacing.  S: Never noticed this before, but it does smell a bit smokey. Roasty malts and coffee also.  T: Tastes of bitter chocolate and coffee, leaves a similar aftertaste. The subtle smoke comes through ever so slightly, just enough. The malt has a slight sweetness to it as well.  M/D: Surpassingly nice body, relative to other porters I've had. Could call this one a stout, maybe? Goes down creamy smooth and has low carbonation. Very drinkable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,qchic,4.35,"Pours reddish dark brown that light can barely penetrate. A finger of creamy head sits atop, and lasts through most of the glass. Smells of roasty malts, chocolate, and creamy coffee. Those also dominate the flavor, and as it warms a bit, I get some raspberry, smoke, and earthy black olive. Mmm, the taste of the coffee in this beer resembles that from high quality beans, so I might describe this as a lighter alternative to bigger breakfast stouts. At less than 6% (not noticeable) with slightly more than a medium body, this one packs a ton of flavor. Too bad it is not more widely available because I would recommend this to any fan of porters and beyond. Great representation of the style from this solid brewery!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BeerImmediately,4.35,"Two 12 oz bottles poured into stout glass.  Dark brown with deep mahogany edges, cardboard-thick cream-colored head, and nice lacey legs.  Bittersweet chocolate smell that also included some smokiness and light hoppy quality.  Smells carried over nicely into the taste, and were joined by some black licorice. Little hop bite really helps to balance out the lightly sweet maltiness. Pretty darn tasty  Starts creamy, and ends with a slightly dry, chalky mouthfeel.  An interesting, yet easy-drinking porter. Would definitely recommend.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,colts9016,4.33,"Got this beer from Kelly, thank you.  Poured into a pint glass at 47 degrees.  Appearance: A nice two finger head that is foamy bubbly with a light tan color. The color of the beer is burnt motor oil. The clarity of the beer is opaque. The head did leave some lacing on the mug.  Nose: A very nice roast malt with a burnt character, chocolate, espresso, melanoid, wood, and a little licorice.  Taste: A deep roasted malt with wood, burnt character, chocolate, espresso, melanoid, licorice, citrus, and some floral character.  Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is smooth, velvety, and with just a slight touch of bitter. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium.

Light tan head yields quickly to spotty lacing.  S: Definite caramel tones complementing coffee bean and some bitter chocolate. Smells intriguing!  T: This is one sturdy beer. Bitter chocolate blends wonderfully with the caramel malt and plenty of roasted coffee as well. Nice, hoppy-bitter finish. Maybe my new favorite porter.  M: Absolutely exceptional. Full and creamy smooth.  D: This beer was a joy to drink, gone before I knew it.  My second GL beer and another winner.

There's actually not much smell to take note of. Muddy roasted malt and slightly sweet... Taste is extremely well balanced. Very nice hop flavor and bitterness. Fresh tasting and even a slight grassiness, something I'm not sure I ever pick up in porters. Roasted malts and mild sweetness, but definitely leaning toward the bitter side.

73,226,yelterdow,4.13,"A big thanks goes out to EPseja for giving me the opportunity to sample this revered Porter. Best by 3/17/09, I will serve this in an imperial pint glass out of the fridge for about 15 minutes.  Appearance- This gorgeous beer pours a deep reddish brown, supporting an enormous four finger light tan crown that gives us a hint of red in there. As the billowy head begins it soapy demise, it remains full and puffy while dragging some of its lace down the inside of the glass. Wonderfully appetizing all around.  Smell- First comes a blast of bittersweet chocolate, followed immediately by a smoky, roasted malt nose. As the beer opens up, the chocolate becomes even more pronounced and takes over the aroma almost completely.  Taste- Rich and smooth, the flavors echo the aroma, concentrating mostly on a smoky, roasty experience with the bittersweet chocolate cutting through the hops.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The texture is smooth, without ever reaching a rolling carbonation that could better exhibit the flavors. It falls almost flat right before the swallow. The rich, prominent character overall makes this a beer a classic, bold Porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Roasted barley, oak, vanilla, espresso all come back again.  5.0 M: Medium body. Good carbonation. Really creamy. Perfect really  5.0 D: This is a very fine dark beer.

Pours black, trailing into translucent dark brown at the narrowest point in the glass, with a super dense one-finger light-khaki head that sticks around beautifully, and clings to the side of the glass tenaciously.  Nose is beautiful - roasty, wafts of coffee, with a chocolaty caramel sweetness underneath. Everything you'd expect it to be.  Taste is excellent as well. Bittersweet dark chocolate up front, with a big, smoky roastiness (and a bit of licorice) following that leads into a lightly bitter, roasty finish, with the roasty acidity really poking its head out around this time as well.  Mouthfeel is nice - rather creamy, medium-full bodied, though it's cut a bit by the acidity as it warms.  Drinkability - Superb. Everything a nice porter should be - flavorful without being overbearing, nice mouthfeel, all around top notch beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ajr24,4.45,"Ohhhh damn. This porter has been praised numerous times and I can see why. I am in love with this beer instantaneously.  12 oz poured into a mug. Served at the bottle recommended 55F.  A- Deep, deep brown, almost black with amber and ruby highlights. Clearly an awesome grain bill here. Fluffy white-tan head shrinks into a generous white-tan layering. Splashes of lacing here and there.  S- Smells of coffee, chocolate, and roasted barley. Some nice hints of nuttiness, too.  T- Gahhhh here it is. Here's the complexity. The flavors take their time running across your tongue. Rich chocolate comes through first with a strong coffee following. The nuttiness is an excellent accompaniment.  M- Smooth. Rich. Silky. Most excellent.  D- Great beer makes for great drinking.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,taylorhamrick,3.7,"Had @ the Hopleaf while the draft coolers were down  Pours a dark brown, with a nice tan head that kind of falls back to a dense ring. Leaves only a little bit of lacing. This one looks pretty normal for the style. The smell comes up with coffee, chocolate, with a moderate sweetness. There's a bit of dry fruitiness in there, too. Again, kind of normal as I would've expected for the style. The taste comes on strong immediately with coffee - roasted barley flavors. There's a note of bitter chocolate - heavy on the roasty bitterness. The sweetness is kind of minimal, but present, barely able to cut into the coffee flavors. The taste all seems to be contained in the first sip, and very little seems to change as I get further into this beer. Mind you, what's here is good, nice and interesting, nothing is really off about it. Towards the end I started to notice a kind of bready, yeasty flavor - maybe some light esters, which don't do too much for me, but again, this one seems right on track, but not quite outstanding. This one is full, but the carbonation provides quite a sting - which actually leads to it feeling a bit thinner. But kind of nice I'd say. This one is good, but not great. It's nice and enjoyable, a beer you could probably enjoy quite a bit.

The nose is really nice, with elements of chocolate and citrus hops, with some coffee and an overall inviting caramel fruitiness, it complements the taste and it's just as enjoyable down to the last sip.  Taste is dark chocolate and black coffee, with some prunes, and roasted malt backed up by a biting, almost oaken hop bitterness in the finish It's so good I want to chug it and I have to force myself to rest between sips.  It's medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation which adds a nice crispness to it.  It's a joy to drink and it's a pity I only have one.

73,226,buschbeer,4.43,I poured into a Detroit Beer Company pint glass to very little tan head. It is very dark but not quite black. If I hold it to the light I see a burgundy glow. I smell roasted malt and maybe a hint of coffee. Sweet malts up front with bitter coffee on the back end. Yummy. There is very little carbonation as expected. I like this stuff.

73,226,mdwalsh,3.93,"A: Did the center of the glass pour, gave me a huge head, which has never happened before, but it's going away fast and even did some of the falling bubbles Guinness Style. Still settled on a 4 finger creamy tan head. There is some active carb, very little but some. The beer itself shoes some red hues amongst the black/brown that dominates. Lacing is very nice.  S: Nose is roast and dark fruits, prunes I'd say. Some malty-molassassy sweetness as well. No hops though, but still good. In different bottles that roast has been more or less powerful.  T: Bittersweet, with the roast again present, but lighter. The dark fruity sweet is more so what's going on. This tastes a little more burnt that usual though.  M: Smooth, light. I'm actually going to give points for the texture of the head here, it's very nice when it touches the lips.  D: Easy, good.

Pours a dark dark brown but not black, a couple of fingers of light tan foam forms in the tulip, light lacing.  Nose is chocolaty, some medium/dark roasting with hints of smokiness, really smooth.  Taste is equally smooth. Roasting without the astringency that sometimes accompanies it, light bitterness, faint hop drying in the finish, swirls of light chocolate, I want to say just the faintest brewed coffee notes. Doesn't seem to have suffered with the few extra months. Smooth, if not slightly light, body that gives a creamy feel. Feels richer than 5.8%.  A solid porter. Easy drinking and with a lower end ABV you could easily have a couple with no regrets. Not overly smoky or bitter, just smooth.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Thick/substantial light tan head with excellent retention. Root beer colored beer (perhaps even darker) Can't see any carbonation, but very dark. Clumps of lacing stick everywhere.  Aroma is wonderful. Thick caramel notes, molasses. Fresh actually. Some cocoa perhaps. Didn't get the cocoa at first. But later it seemed to make sense.  This is a good beer. Well balanced between the roasted goodness and the sweetness. Light cocoa flavors, a touch or roasted bitterness. A touch of charcoal and smoke. There is just a hint of sweetness then it almost finishes dry. More smoke in the lingering aftertaste,  Smooth as silk. The slightest carbonation.. Medium bodied.  Wonderfully drinkable.

73,226,photomike,4.12,"Thanks to bulletrain76 for sharing!  Pours a dark brown with a somewhat quickly receding head. A respectable amount of wet lacing slowly follows the level of beer left in your glass.  Smell is very nice; milk chocolate and coffee notes play off each other with a carmelly sweet malt background for it all.  The taste is slightly boozy, but chocolate is the star. Very bitter espresso is present at the finish.  Mouthfeel is creamy and slick with a puckering bitter finish and sparkly carbonation. Not bad, but a tad overcarbonated for my liking in a porter.  Highly drinkable, the only thing holding this beer back is the bitter finish; otherwise this would be infinitely drinkable.

Very dark brown, bordering on black, but with red highlights when held up to the candle. A large tan head forms and lasts for the entire drink (which isn't long... this stuff is too delicious to sit), and lays down concentric rings of lace. Sweet chocolate aroma, mixed in with coffee, caramel and roasted nuts.  The flavour has bittersweet chocolate in droves, but as further sips are taken it recedes a touch to reveal a complex mix of the aforementioned chocolate, coffee, dates and caramel. There's also a pleasing hop bite in the tail. Its a beer that demands to be lifted to your lips as soon as you put the glass down. What's more, the excellence extends to the mouthfeel, which is heavy yet smooth, which suits the luxurious richness of the beer very well indeed.  Yet another epic winner from Great Lakes.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

I pick up on some coffee as it warms. Not much sweet malt is there.  T-It has a really nice combination of roasty and sweet malt. As it goes down the roast clings to the back of the mouth. In between sips there is a nice bittersweet taste that is left.  M-On the lighter spectrum of medium bodied. It is quite smooth with a nice carbonation level.

I'm not a porter expert but I have tried many many stouts. This tastes like an oatmeal stout to me - possible chocolate tones. It's not a thick as many stouts so maybe that's part of why it's called a porter.  A nice flavor and more available on tap at bars than the stouts I am reminded of like 8 Ball, which is another bargain-ish stout.

Appearance: foamy, tan to off-white head. Color appears opaque, but if I hold it up to the light, it's very dark brown and slightly ruby red. Good head retention, with a fair amount of lacing. Maintains a thin layer of foam on the top.  Smell: a little black licorice, mostly dark roast coffee or chocolate notes. Has a slight smokiness to it.  Taste: starts out kind of like coffee-milk or something - not a ton of taste, just a little thickness. Then sweet, and then pretty bitter. Probably sweeter than Guinness, less watery.  Mouthfeel: not too thick and not too thin for something this strength. It's not overly foamy or overly fizzy. The mouthfeel seems just about right.  Drinkability: a little chewy to be called a session beer. I don't think it's a refreshing beer exactly. It could be called soothing. I find that these must go down easy because the glass of beer seems to get empty quickly, and yet I don't feel like drinking several more.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,wchesak,3.82,"Poured into a pint glass.  A - very dark brown with hints of red on the edges and bottom of the glass, good thick inch of tan head, leaves good lace before becoming a tan ring on the glass  S - bittersweet chocolate, roasted barley, underlying coffee  T - follows along with the smell, bittersweet chocolate is more pronounced, coffee becomes more present mid swallow, hops are there but hard to pin point them, I am picking up a slight dryness in the aftertaste  M - maybe not as thick as I would have lacked but certainly not lacking body, carbonation is decent  D - everything ends up coming together pretty well in the end, going to need to let this one warm up a bit more next time, overall a good porter worth having again",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,connecticutpoet,4.2,"Received in trade from frozensoul327. Much appreciated!  On the pour, this beer produced a one finger tan head atop a clear dark brown body. The head had some persistence, but eventually died down to a ring around the glass.  Aroma was of roasted, nearly burnt malts. A slight fruitiness was noted, as well as some sweet dark chocolate. A little bit of bitterness was present also.  Taste was of roasted malts, coffee, bitter chocolate, and a whisp of hops. The finish was long, smooth, and roasted.  Mouthfeel was smooth, as noted above. Good body for a porter, not too heavy or viscous or syrupy as a stout could have been.  Drinkability is good. I liked it, and would revisit it occasionally if it were locally available.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,LordAdmNelson,4.25,"A- Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights. A lot of tan-brown head with good retention and lacing. Looks great.  S- I get some fruit--apples, cherries, and some others I can't pin. A little hoppy goodness comes through too. Slight chocolate in the background. Smells really good.  T- Again, some fruit--apples, citrus, chocolate and coffee malts in the finish. It starts with a cooling sensation--almost like mint-- but not necessarily minty tasting. More acidic than I thought it would be--is that the hops? Not necessarily the most enjoyable taste, IMO, but definitely really interesting. Some hops in the finish. Very surprising taste. Some vanilla too. --EDIT: Second look at this confirmed what I thought: the first notes are from a review of a bad bottle. Second bottle was great, a hint of citrus, good roasted malt, lingering leafy finish. Really a delicious porter, extremely drinkable.  M- Again, the cooling sensation is interesting. A little light-bodied for what I was expecting, but not bad.  D- Ok, but almost too complex to make a session out of it. The almost puckering acidity is definitely worth the experience, but not for a session. EDIT: second bottle (not infected) had tremendous drinkability, would make session after session out of this one.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BanditBrewingCo,4.22,"received as an extra along with a few other GL beers in trade with Beachbum1975, thanks Shane! Held onto this one for a while now, freshness date on bottle says to enjoy by 9/19/08...whoops. I'll have to take that into serious consideration here but hopefully it's held up well.  Dark but not quite black, appears mahogany when held to the light. Super creamy head that's easily aroused with each sip.  smells of dark roasted malts, some of their bitterness comes through, so does a slightly sweet creamy, almost lactic yeastiness.  Roasted malts, subdued chocolate and coffee (most likely dulled with the age on this one) - seem to have melded in with the hop bitterness. I'm going to have to try a fresh one of these.  Very smooth. sharp but not excessive carbonation on the tip of the tongue combined with a creaminess on top that gently coats the roof of the mouth with a fluffy layer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,alcstradamus,4.03,"A--Pours a deep dark brown that glows ruby red when held to the light. Nearly 3 fingers of head using a moderately hard pour into a pint glass. Just a little bit of lacing.  S--Light roasted malts on the nose, with some dark chocolate and caramel present as well. A little but of a floral hoppiness in the background.  T--The roastiness really comes through on the palate. Burnt malts are at the forefront, with all other flavors taking a backseat and needing to be hunted down. I actually remember this one being a little more complex, but it somewhat empty.  M--Maybe I shouldn't have drank this after sipping on a J.W. Lee's Vintage, because it is seeming thin too me. Its not quite what I would call ""watery,"" but it could use a little more body. Carbonation levels are fine.  D--Classic session porter with enough flavor to remain interesting. Not something I would necessarily reach for when I am only having one, though. This would be a great introductory porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,thehand,4.13,"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Appears very dark murky brown with about 1/2"" of light brown thick foamy head. Head persists for a while, leaving foamy cap and spotty lacing. Aroma has notes of sweet caramel malt, toffee, chocolate. Taste has flavors of roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, dry earthy hops in finish. Mouthfeel is full up front but seems thinner in finish. Silky smooth mouthfeel with medium carbonation.

73,226,littlekidlover,4.23,"Poured this into my favorite beer drinking glass, not tasting glass like many of my reviews since this is one of my standbys. Pours a dark brown hue with a light caramel head. This one always takes 2 or 3 pours to let it's massive head settle. The smell is strong with coffee, vanilla, a little dried fruit. The taste is heavy with coffee, vanilla, bittersweet chocolate, and a bit of smokiness. The mouthfeel is fairly crisp for the style, no real detectable stickiness. This is a very drinkable beer, I like to alternate this with a PA or IPA. Another solid beer from Great Lakes, which is also a price winner averaging $7.99 a sixer around here.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,youngleo,4.32,"Poured to caramelish head that was probably about 1 finger. Head didnt last long. But the porter left rings with every swallow. Brew was almost black in color with a slight redish tint. Had a slight sweet smell of chocolate. Also of coffee and smoke. Tasted very good. Slight alcohol notes. Also a strong coffee, caramel, and smoke. Left a sightly bitter aftertaste in your mouth. That aftertaste also left a strong smoke flavor. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was about right. Ive been wanting to try this porter for a long time. I finally found it by luck.(I wasnt really looking for it). It was well worth the wait.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Arbitrator,4.23,"A: Pours an opaque black with ruby tint when held to the light. Has a huge, generous cream-colored head that takes several minutes to recede to any drinkable level, leaving tons of sticky lacing down the glass as I wait. The drink continues to leave tons of lacing down the glass. The head never fully vanishes.  S: Crystal, roasted black malts, and dark chocolate malt. Has a slight wood and coffee aroma to it.  T: Chocolate up front, which gives way to a roast and coffee flavor in the mid-palate. Coffee remains into the finish and is accompanied by a slight smoke flavor. The aftertaste is a cumulative black malt bitterness.  M: Slightly thinner than medium-bodied. Lower than medium carbonation which does pretty well for the style and lets it have a long-running bitter finish.  D: A good example of the style. Not a flavor I really enjoy, and I feel it would benefit from having a thicker body. I am glad I had this, but there are a couple of locals I would prefer to this one.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,deapokid,4.13,"This is slowly becoming one of my favorite porters.  Opens with deep red coloration eventually turning a rich brown. Head is super creamy and elegant, colored white with flecks of black.  Beer smells quite sweet, with hints of caramel, coffee and root beer.  Taste is complex, at once prominently featuring the roasted notes of espresso and sweet pipe tobacco with some mild fruitness (grapefruit) in the aftertaste and maybe a touch of hops.  Drinking this brew leaves you with a nice musky taste in your mouth that reminded me of the aftertaste of a cup of strong coffee (in a positive way).  It may be a bit too decadent for excessive drinking, but it is definitely a delicious porter which is certainly at the height of the style in the US and the rest of the world.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

It is living proof that you can buy good beer in unexpected places.  The beer poured brown in color in the newly purchased logo pint glass bought at the college bookstore. There is a light wispy head. The nose is a pleasant coffee aroma. Roasted malt and creamy attack of coffee and malt. Somewhat bitter at the finish, with hints of smoke in the aftertaste. This is a good beer and a pleasure to drink, but I was surprised to find it among the Top 100 on this site. Perhaps I need to start sending out some of the great local beers from here to build their reputation.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,wofat,4.23,"Pours a very dark brown that reveals itself as garnet red when backlit in a narrower glass. Beautiful tan headiness makes me quaff the aroma that is caramel and chocolate and a teeny tiny bit of alcohol... makes me thirsty.  As caramel and mild roast overtake my tastebuds I am thoroughly pleased by the 'middle of the road' mouthfeel (not overly milky, not thin as water; just quite pleasant). A roasty alcohol/coffee flavor resonates for some time, with a mild tart tang. Not intrusive, just recognizable. Makes me think of Sumatra.  Overall impression is a wonderfully rendered porter with some pep. Quite yummy. Headed to the basement to get another bottle.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Smokey and quite roasted, the porter packs a healthy chocolate punch up front, which melts into a bitter smoke/coffee flavor that lingers after swallowing. The brew feels thick, smooth, and substantial, but the carbonation seems prickly.

73,226,ffejherb,4.42,"12oz. bottle into DFH specialty glass on 4/21/09.  A - Poured a dark brown body with lighter brown hues and burgundy tones toward the bottom, above which sat almost two fingers of creamy tan head that eventually settled into a patchy film but left quite a bit of nice lacing behind.  S - First whiff reveals an apparent milky chocolate character, followed by subtle smokey notes and a hint of coffee. Some earthy hop notes also emerge as the liquid warmed up a bit.  T - Kicks off with milk chocolate sweetness, but is quickly countered by a nutty malt character and hints of smoke and mild coffee. Edmund Fitzgerald gets more bitter with each passing sip, though certainly never gets overbearing or too assertive for the style. Finishes with earthy hop notes and a very mild astringency.  M - Medium body, a tad thin perhaps, but quite smooth nonetheless with just a touch of bristly carbonation. Slightly bitter on the palate with a dash of astringency.  D - Almost four months after its preferred ""enjoy by"" date, and this still holds up extremely well. Very nice multi-faceted porter with lots going on.

Finish has an earthy bitterness and long lasting roasted coffee flavors. Carbonation is fluffy and smooth in the mouth, and the beer is medium-full in body.

A 1/4 inch tan head forms and quickly reduces to a light lacing around the edges.  My initial smell includes a healthy level of dark chocolate followed by some very nice capuccino notes. There is a certain level of smokiness that hides out.  The taste starts out with some chocolate and metallic notes and is followed by coffee. It then seems to turn a bit bitter. The caramel sweetness and malts are definitely the highlight.  The mouthfeel is good also with a nice level of carbonation that keeps it crisp without completely overwhelming the great taste. A dryness sits at the finish and it does not level you mouth feeling like paste but fairly clean in my opinion. It is medium bodied overall.  This beer is quite drinkable.

Appearance: Pours darkest chocolate brown, almost black, with no clarity and a 1 1/2 finger frothy tan head. Huge, soapy bubbles form and retain at a skim. Washes of foam hang along the glass.  Smell: The smell is pretty big for a Great Lakes beer - I usually only get the faintest aroma from their beers. Biscuity malts have a powdery essence, kind of like cocoa powder. Slight caramel and roastiness.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Delicious full-bodied roast coffee, dark, bittersweet chocolate, and caramel malts are complemented by a bright, moderate hop finish that comes across a little like green apple. Feel is full of carbonation and body is medium to light. Finish is drying at first from the vapor of the alcohol, followed by a slight, coffee stickiness.

Beautiful nose, seriously the perfect porter.  Taste is medium bodied and immediately very chalky. A strong burnt, over burnt, old coffee sort of dark malt taste as well as a stale burnt coffee bitterness. Somewhat watery, with a slight salt water taste. Very light and drinkable, especially as it warms.  I'm not sure about this beer. It smells amazing, but the flavor doesn't seem to live up to the smell too well.

Coffee and chocolate, smoky, oats, syrup and dark fruits. Reminds me of a campfire. T/M: Bitter burnt dark chocolate, espresso notes to boot. Balanced smokiness with a touch of hops to round out. Light mouthfeel with great carbonation that leaves a pleasant tingling bittersweet note on the palate. Hops contribute to the bitter left behind. D: Amazing.

Difficult to describe the balance of flavors, but whatever it is it works great for me.  Mouthfeel: Medium thick and a little heavy, perfect for the style, holding it in your mouth is like having dark chocolate melt in your mouth.

Aroma is dark chocolate and cocoa powder. Dry bakers chocolate and a light smoke. Deep aromas of coffee and burnt malt.  Flavor is burnt malt, deeply roasted and well boiled. A tannic tartness comes through right before the hop flavor creeps up, which is present enough to balance the sweetness of the grain bill in this brew. Next, the chocolate and coffee begins it's performance. Finishes smokey and slightly dry from the hops.  Mouthfeel is medium and lush. Not too thin, not too chewy.

Taste of dark chocolate, almonds, a bit smokey and roasted malt flavor providing a nice bittering effect.  Flavor sticks around on the palate, nice and smokey.

I've said it before - believe it or not, this is a good thing. A very good thing. More subtle hints of french bread, cider, caramel apples, celery and cheese. I s'pose this qualifies as a 12 course bouquet. Again, I dig it.  The first sip hits my tongue - salty oysterlettes sit on my lips. Cafamel, coffee open up big time in the middle. Bitter chocolate swallows me whole at the end. The kicker is the echo of piney hop bitterness that hangs in my throat for minutes. gorgeous.  A hearty mouthfeel, more than enough body for a porter.

I have grown to really enjoy this brewery out of Cleveland. I have yet to find a poor beer from them. Here I was thinking that I would have a hard time finding quality beer in Erie, PA. Not so, not so.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Lepley,5,"From a variety twelve pack from Giant Eagle. I think they accidentally put six of these in the case and I can't complain.  A: Pours blackish-brown with two fingers of brown head, nice lacing but little retention. S: Sweet, roastiness, coffee, smokey. T: Coffee, roasty, smokey, sweet, fruity, bitter, chocolate.

73,226,EatsTacos,4.55,"Poured a dark brown with amber hues, good head and some decent lacing on a pint glass  Aroma has a good amount of coffee and chocolate notes with a background hoppiness  Taste is not overly smokey or sweet, but is rather quite bitter and coffee-like. There are hints of fruitiness as well, cherries and raspberries. This is so far the best American porter I've had and among the best porters I've had.  Again mouthfeel is spot on for a porter, medium to light bodied with a pretty pronounced, sharp carbonation. This adds to the drinkability for me a lot.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,raoulduke37,4.47,"Poured into a pint glass, just after the freshness date. Black with reddish hues near the bottom and sides, with a cream colored head that retains well, but not too much lacing. Smell is great - chocolate, toffee, caramel, with mild phenolic background. Taste is hoppy up front, but then warms up to a bitter/coffee background, and definitely some cream on the way down. Someone before described this as being very ""balanced."" Indeed it is. This is a great brew all around, especially if one needs a break from RIS's, as someone mentioned before also. With the low ABV, this is most definitely sessionable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,DrewOSU,3.81,"A: Pours a dark brown to a chestnut color, ½ khaki head with a medium amount of fluffy sponge on the top. Decent amount of soapy like lacing on pour. A white spider web lacing down the glass upon completion.  S: Hints of chocolate, coffee and molasses. I do not get a lot from the nose. I tried warming it up a little, but again, the smells didn't overwhelm me.  M/T: Light to a watery, medium body. A good hit of hop bitterness on the tongue on a clean pallet, only to be calmed by smooth roasted malts and a good amount of carbonation. Small amount of coffee and chocolate in the back of my mouth after swallow. The beer finishes light and pretty clean. Not a huge beer, none of the flavors will come overwhelm you in anyway, however the flavors are well blended. I think ""blended"" is a good word to describe this beer.  D: This beer is lighter than I expected it to be. Not a huge beer, but big enough to be a good sipper. Pretty good for someone who is looking from a break from a big RIS, but doesn't want a lager.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Cherry and cocoa/mocha. Bitter coffee beans. Dark chcolate, some raisin and prunes. Lots of strong, dry cocoa.  The taste is sweeter on the palate, but with a bitter swallow. First sip is sweet stone fruits like raisin, grape and dates. A hint of plum. Sweeter than the average porter. Some dark cherry.  The feel is thick and creamy, almost like chocolate milk.

73,226,saradad,4.18,"Okay, this is the last review of Great Lakes mixed case brews, and I saved my favorite for last, Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. Also happens to be a nostalgic little song from my youth as the 8-track tape containing this song was the first ""album"" I ever purchased, but I digress. The beer pours a nice deep, not quite opaque brown color with a nice light tan head that sticks around the sides of my glass quite nicely. There is no visible carbonation. The smell is of bittersweet chocolate covered cherries and toasty burnt toffee with hints of dark toast thrown in. There's almost no hops aroma evident. The taste mimics the scent with a very slight balance of lightly citrusy hops in the dry finish along with a touch of fading burnt chocolate with a slight alcohol presence. The feel is somewhat thinner than expected perhaps solidly in the medium range? This is a nicely drinkable beer, however, nothing overwhelming, nicely balanced and very tasty.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Aroma of roasted malts, slightly smokey with a trace of hops. Very well balanced taste between the slightly bitter hops, roasted malt and almost chocolate sensation. Only slightly bitter so as to offset the cooked grains/malt. Medium bodied but very rich in flavor. Medium carbonation at best. Easy to drink and actually somewhat smooth. Enjoyable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jkrich,4.37,"12 oz. bottle with a stamped drink by date on label. It has an image of the ill-fated ship Edmund Fitzgerald and a blurb about the ship on the side.  Poured a nearly black, opaque color with a fleeting tan head; very little lacing. When held up to the light, there are hints of deep ruby red slivers.  The aroma was of tangy sweetness with a molasses like quality. I could almost smell hints of dark chocolate.  A very refreshing taste of sweet malt and chocolate flavors initially attacks the tongue with a lingering semi-sweet, coffee flavor on the tongue. The hops keep this from becoming overpowering or cloying. Overall, a very refreshing, somewhat light bodied interpretation of the style. Just the right amount of carbonation and medium bodied, keep this one interesting.  It has been several years since I have tried a porter (the last time was Sierra Nevada's interpretation which I also found highly drinkable). It is still winter, and this quaffable porter is the perfect ale.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BacklitAvenger,4.43,"Bought a six pack and brought it to a BYOB Thai restaurant. Ate spicy ba me jan ron and drank a bottle. I love porters, and this is right up there with the best.  Appearance - Darkest brown to black with mahogany highlights along the rim of the glass and at the bottom via refraction when held up to the light. A light tan head that rapidly vanishes. I tend to pour in a fashion that purposely reduces head, so this may not be representative. And no hating on me for pouring less head: it's how I like it and I dont give a shit how you drink beer, so you should in turn respect my tastes even if you think they are stupid and idiotic and sinful and blasphemous and so forth. Head lacing leaves residual traces on the walls of the glass.  Smell - I smell toffee or caramel and malts. It smells toasty. Can't smell the alcohol. There's definitely for me a raisen aroma, strange as it may sound. I don't really taste it that strongly in the beer itself, but aromatically it is present and accounted for.  Taste - Not much fruit here unlike say Flying Dog's Gonzo Porter. Or chocolate like Great Lakes Blackout Stout. Or the vicious hop profile of Three Floyds Black Sun. Rather there's a semi-sweet malt flavor accentuated by toasty notes, roasted coffee, and hints of smoke. Certainly less sweet than the above mentioned Gonzo porter. There's toastyness in the malts, with a caramel sort of flavor and a strong bitterness. It's more bittersweet from the roasted malt and resinously bitter from the hops, which offer a distinct snappy crisp finish. Mid drink there kicks in a strong roasted coffee/toasted chocolate sort of flavor, a real roasty toasty lovelyness that brings it to a clean finish along with the crisp finish of the aforementioned hops. Aftertaste present, but pleasant, so no resentment. The alcohol provides just a touch of warmth. The aftertaste itself consists of burnt flavors, in a pleasant way. The same flavor winds its way throughout the drinking process but only comes to the fore after the stronger flavors of hops and more substantial malts, likely chocolate, black, brown or crystal malts.  Mouthfeel - Crisp and yet recognizably a porter. Certainly there are thicker beers, but while this is crisp it is also full bodied and substantial in its own way. It is lower alcohol than some porters I have drank and that shows in the mouthfeel. There's less of a kick too it, more smooth. Perfect carbonation for this beer, not too much and not too little. The viscosity is highly detected, but it is pleasantly thick rather than sticky, sweet, or cloying.  Drinkability - I have on previous occasions finished off twelve of these babies in a row. They're that good, that drinkable. The alcohol is blended into the flavors so well that you can't really tell it's there in any unpleasant way. It's ABV is low enough that you can drink several without getting too far off your ass and it is neither too filling nor so watery that you don't notice it going down.  All in all I highly recommend this stuff. It's cheaper than comparable porters like the aforementioned Flying Dog Gonzo Porter, which is about the same price but comes in a four pack rather than a six. And while it usually matches Bell's price, Bell's porters can't really compete here.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Bung,4.42,"Pours a pretty dark brown with an off white head. Roast, coffee and chocolate aroma. Chocolate, coffee, slight blackberry flavors. More carbonation than some for a porter. Still almost creamy though. Also a little more of a hop bite, and finishes crisp and clean. Could drink a ton of this no problem. All in all a real good porter, would recommend.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

M: Very smooth, warming, perfect carbonation. D: Extremely drinkable beer, this is certainly a winner and one of my new favorite porters. The flavors are all mixed to perfection.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,damienblack,4.22,"Thanks to JohnTravolta21 for this bottle!  Pours dark chocolatey brown with little fanfare. Quickly dissipating cocoa colored head, leaves decent lacing around the glass. Smells nice and roasty, sweet yet dark malt and some chocolate on the nose.  Little bit of coffee up front, some toffee/butterscotch, but the main flavor carried is a grizzled cocoa flavor that just sits pleasantly on the palate. Hooray for chocolate burps! The dark roasted malts are just sweet enough to make for a very pleasant experience, but not so sweet as to be cloying and in the way. Slight hop kick at the end, but not much to that department. This is all about the chocolate. Overall pretty simple, a little thin without anything amazing happens. But it is a very easy drink, and the simplicity works in this case. Were this available to me, it would probably be a regular go-to beer. I wish we could get this here.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

There is a slight hint of hops on the back of the tongue for a fleeting second.  M- I would call it thin, but it compliments the taste so that it doesn't feel like I am chewing on chocolate syrup.

73,226,BARFLYB,4.08,12oz bottle into a Lancaster Brewing pint glass. Purchased a 4 pack and this is my last one.  A- GLEFP pours out a dark brown bordering on black with a nice one inch dark tan head. This one has a nice shine to it. Nice lines of foam are seen as the liquid goes down.  S- Edmund has a deep robust roast musk to it. Some toffee/caramel is present while a heap of chocolate is there with slight espresso tones. Not much in terms of hops but that's common in the porters i've had thus far.  T- Is an extension of the nose with all the flavors coming through more. Edmund's dark roasty flavor is evident in the beginning but melds into more of a smooth creamy coffee/ chocolate mix. Sweet malts present throughout.  M- Edmund is medium bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation. Coats the palette just enough to get the full spectrum of flavors without being overbearing. No trace of alcohol.  D- At 5.8% this one is quite sessionable and the great balance of flavors make this one a winner. While some porters come flat this one delivers and is worthy of all the praise. I just wish I could buy cases of this in my area.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,MuchoCerveza,4.37,Very tasty porter. As soon as you smell the beer you can already tell what it is going to taste like. A strong coffee and chocolate smell hit you very hard. It sets up your taste-buds very nicely to what they are about to be swimming in.  Once the beer hits your mouth you instantly get that taste of barley and chocolate. Upon exhaling you can feel the strong aroma hit the back of your throat. It goes down very smoothly with the rich flavor making you look forward to the next swig. Seconds after you swallow the beer you get that harsh aftertaste in your throat that hits you like a cup of coffee and just leaves you wanting more.  I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a nice strong beer with distinct chocolate and coffee flavors.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,JerzDevl2000,4,"Picked this up in Ohio with all the other beers during my HoF run at the beginning of the year...  I had this at a beer festival I went to a few years back at Stoudts in Pennsylvania. Didn't remember much since I had quite a few beers that night, but this on my list of ""to review"" on here and thankfully, I finally got around to it. I'll admit that I'm not much of a porter drinker, as I like Weizenbocks and Stouts for darker beers this time of the year. With that in mind, this is a solid brew with a very unique taste and mouthfeel to it, and worth drinking on a cold night like this one!  The pour was decent, as the beer had a rich, oak hue with some garnet at the edges. There was a bit of head but unlike other users on here, I haven't been able to find any lacing on the sides of my pint glass. The taste...well, this seems to be a varitation of a nice scotch ale. Very smoky, with some caramel, bourbon, and molasses mixed together for good measure. The mouthfeel is thin and the hops can be felt from the get-go. The smell is more towards the roasted-toffee side, but I haven't been able to detect any chocolate in here like some users. What remains in the aftertaste is a mellow version of a bitter espresso, but not strong enough that any biscotti has to be eaten with this!  If not in actual ABV%, then by taste, is this too strong to be a session beer. It's not that tha alcohol comes out of nowhere, but the bitterness precludes this beer from being enjoyed at a fast pace. This isn't spicy or warming but rather, it's level of roasting is pretty much as good as it gets. The hops add a good level of depth to this and overall, this is a great beer for fall or winter.

Slight bit of sweetness as well. Also a very slight but distinctness of hops near the end. Very inviting.  Taste: Taste from the hops is very noticeable at first followed by the chocolate and it leaves a very strong aftertaste that is bitey given the roastiness to it.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied yet very smooth texture with a medium carbonation feel.  Drinkability: This beer is very nice to sip on but I would not drink more than 2 back to back in a sitting as near the middle of the second one the afterbite is very powerful and the roastiness of the brew is intense.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The first quarter of the glass felt a bit too light to me, but seemed to thicken up as it warmed to make for quite a nice feel.  This is a solid porter, there is no doubt.

The nose has a roasted malt smell, some coffees and perhaps a tinge of baking chocolate in the end.

Sweet, but with a much more roasted quality. In smaller quantities, a chocolate dimension, as well as a coffee facet.  Sweet, in almost a lactose way, much like in the aroma.

More chocolate and deep dry black-malt roast with a balanced maltiness, some light and sweet and some more bittersweet. A hop tickle comes through right thereafter, and a delicious whisky-barrel finish (like vanilla and caramel). Beautifully balanced between deep roastiness, malt, bitterness and caramel.  M: Full and round, creamy and juicy with maybe just a little more carbonation than might be perfect, but hey.

As with the aroma, dark chocolate and bitterness follows. This is less sweet than I prefer in a porter, but definitely has the roasted malt character and long finish.  Soft carbonation is there for accentuation of this full-bodied, almost dense porter, with the texture of syrup.  Edmund Fitzgerald has greater depth than Lake Erie and is worthy of a night where good times prevail.  date consumed: 29 Oct 2008",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Clydesdale,4.72,"A: A deep, dark brown with a garnet tinge. A relatively large, creamy brown head bubbles forth with great retention. Lacing is excellent, leaving thick trails of chunky foam on the side of the glass.  S: Dark roasted notes are most noticeable, with some caramel/toffee character. Definite chocolate and espresso, plus some smoky/earthy aromas.  T: Heavily roasted/slightly burnt caramel malts provide some initial sweetness. An almost lactic milk chocolate/latte-esque flavor lurking throughout - delicious. Some earthy, possibly leafy hops provide balance. I detect slight hints of oak and vanilla.  M: Smooth, creamy and quite robust. It's as dense and chewy on the tongue as any American Porter. A really outstanding mouthfeel here.  D: I love American Porters, and this is definitely my favorite. Great Lakes puts out a lot of wonderful beers, but in my opinion this is their world-class standout.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,SmithwicksNut,4.62,"A: A tan head that stays awhile. A clear dark brown almost coffelike color.  S: Not overpowering in aroma but you do smell the toasted malts and coffee aroma. Not much in hops aroma which is typical in porters.  T: This is the first ""5"" I have given. The taste is very good. Everything comes through...the toasted malts with some slight coffee overtones also a hint of chocolate.  M: Nice carbonation with the full bodied beer. A little aftertaste.  O: A superior porter, one of the best I have ever tasted. I can drink a number of these and not get tired of it. It goes down quite easy.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S-This smells just like a porter should; burnt sugar, coffee, caramel, toasted grains. Makes my mouth start to water.  T/M-Just like it smells. Smooth taste at first with a good light feel in the mouth. As you swallow, the beers flavor really stands out; the coffee and toasted grain flavors take front stage. An earthy hop flavor at the end gives the beer a good finish.  I have never had a beer from Great Lakes and this one didn't let me down.

Good lacing and retains a small head the entire way. Body is a little thin. Oily mouthful. Unsweetened chocolate, coffee, and a great hop finish that leaves a sweet aftertaste.

About a finger of head that dissipates quickly into a small cocoa layer with an interesting but minimal lace. The beer is not quite ""none more black"" but it's damn close.  Smell is a good strong toffee scent, a light hint of chocolate, and a roasty coffee smell. Excactly what I want from this style.  Taste/Mouth - The beer is carbonated just right and meduim bodied, with the beer seemingly going through distinct phases of taste as it coats the palate. Opens up robust and roasty and then finishes with a creamy/coffee/chocolatey aftertaste.  Drinkability is very good. I don't see why this wouldn't be a perfect session beer.

Complex and inviting.  T: Very interesting. The coffee is not overpowering at all. There's a bit of toffee, a satisfying malty/sweet undertone, and then a snap of... burnt biscuit?... in the finish.  M: Several distinct phases, each of them interesting and satisfying. Each sip reminds me of someone diving onto a water slide, sliding down, doing a little flip and finally splashing into the water.

73,226,gpcollen1,4.4,Pours a beautiful dark and robust black with a bit of a cocoa head in my Sam Adams glass. Aroma is loaded with chocolate roastiness with almost a chocolate milk smell to it.  Taste follows right along with the nose in in the deep roasty/smokey and chocolate presence buoyed by a lively carbonation and a pleasant light bitterness on the finish. A very smooth beer to drink and enjoy yet feels a hair thin - maybe it is just me. I would love it if this was a local brew.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Bounty628,4.38,"The Edmund Fitzgerald has an ABV of 5.8% and has an amazing drinkability factor to it. Though some porters might be better off as being a single offering, the smooth yet flavorful complexity of this offering make the Edmund Fitzgerald an ideal session beer.  Poured from a 12 ounce bottle, Edmund Fitzgerald pours a very deep and dark brown to almost black color. There is a very nice amount of a creamy tan head that stays with the pour for a while and then lends way to a similar tan to off-white lacing that holds true throughout the tasting.  There is a perfectly balanced amount of carbonation to this beer which for a porter sort of impressed me. Some porters strike me as being too flat in nature, but this offering had the right amount of carbonation to really work the beer across the palate.  The smell is a bit faint for this offering but there is certainly enough to be taken away from the smell. Immediately what you notice is a roasted malt barley characteristic with a hint of coffee mixed in, as well. Malts seem to be the predominant theme in the smell, and the taste can quickly be imagined.  The taste is certainly what makes the Edmund Fitzgerald a true winner. There is simply put an Ideal roasted malt flavor with nice additions of coffee and chocolate present. This beer has a very rich and dark complex flavor to it but stays away from being too burnt or overdone when it comes to the roasted coffee highlights. There is a symbiosis to the flavor that truly works and the malted characteristics present in the nose certainly are all that you were hoping for in the taste.  The taste then leads into a balanced mouthfeel that is interesting to say the least. There are times when you almost forget that you are drinking a porter and note a stout because the complex pairing of the malt and the coffee notes often bring to mind a nice coffee stout. However, there is a bit less creaminess to this porter than might be present in a stout and there is a smoothness that will keep you coming back.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,MasterSki,4.46,"12 oz bottle from a stein. Best before 2/24/2009.  A - Dark, dark brown - almost black. One finger of creamy tan head that dissipates very slowly and coats the sides of the glass. I had to wait a long time before it reached a complex lace. Lots of visible carbonation. This is one great looking porter.  S - Roasted malt barley, coffee with a healthy amount of cream, bittersweet chocolate. I can't believe that this brew adheres to the Purity Law - they really get a lot out of barley, hops, yeast, and water. The smell isn't that strong - you really have to get your nose up close.  T - Starts bitter like burnt coffee, then gets very sweet with the tiniest bit of citrus hops. It's a simple combination but incredibly effective, and each taste brings out something slightly different (cream, burnt malt, chocolate, etc.).  M - A little on the watery side - I know it's a porter and not a stout, but it could use some more body. The carbonation has a nice tingle. Leaves a sticky aftertaste.  D - THE session porter. Superb at 5.8%, and goes down incredibly easy. This is a great brew for cold winter nights.

I was blown away by this beer and was saddened that all I had was the one bottle. This will definitely be making it's way to my fridge again soon.  Appearance: An awesome color -- a deep dark brown with a little bit of a deep red in it too. A head of 1 and 1/2 fingers that faded quickly to a firm thin lacing on top.  Smell: Chocolatey and malty, a little bit of roast in the back. I double checked the bottle when I smelled it to make sure it said ""porter"" and not ""stout"" -- because it was very reminiscent of a couple of chocolate stouts that I've had.  Taste: Just like the smell, the chocolate and malts hit you quick and then there's a slight burnt roasty taste in the back of it. At this point, I think I triple-checked the bottle to make sure it said ""porter.""  Mouthfeel: Coats nicely and it's a little chewy, but not like the stouts that I've been kind of comparing this to in my mind -- so it's actually a little lighter which adds to the...  Drinkability: High. This beer tastes great and goes down wonderfully. While it's still a little on the heavy side, it's easier to drink than some stouts because it doesn't sit very heavy in the stomach.

73,226,cvstrickland,4.45,"A twelve-ounce bottle with label art featuring the namesake ore carrier ship slashing her way through a raging Great Lakes storm, uncapped at UPS box-arrival temperature and poured into my DFH shaped pint glass yields a clear ruddy garnet body topped with two fingers of grainy, sponge cake holey-style light tan foam. The cap of fine bubbles recedes to a chunky sheet and leaves quite a few fat rings and a bit of webby lacing on the glass.  The aroma is darkly roasted and chocolatey with a mellow note of pumpernickel bread and caramel sweetness. Dark, woody charcoal kicks around an aroma reminiscent of livestock sweet feed--a medium-toasted grain-and-molasses note--that struggles to emerge from the darkness.  The taste is richly dark-malty with a touch of spice and powdered cocoa. A mildly fruity, semisweet chocolate note is dried and balanced by earthy hops and a dusty burnt bitter mocha note that lingers in the aftertaste.  The drink is perfectly-carbonated, medium in body, and highly quaffable. Edmund Fitzgerald is an outstanding porter that I'd certainly buy regularly if 'twas available in my marketplace.

Smell was almost non-existant (I do suffer from allergies this time of year)  But taste was also missing. I kind of hope that I got a bad bottle. But this is really dissapointing from what I expected. There's a light roasted chocolate flavor, but that's about it.  mouthfeel, average for a porter.

UPDATE:  I received my second bottle of this. The first bottle I got was obviously ""off"". This one is much better.  Best before date: 4/9/09  Pours out black with a two finger tan head. Great lacing.  Smell is of a roasted oak smell. Tastes a quick hop bite with a nice malty finish. Leaves a sweet layer on your lips.

S: Mainly milk chocolate but for some reason I'm also smelling melted plastic, which is a little off-putting. I've had EFP on many previous occasions and never noticed this, so I'll give the beer the benefit of the doubt and blame my nose tonight.  T: More milk chocolate and roasted malts, a little coffee. Start and middle of a sip are a little sweet, but the finish is definitely dry with a little hop bitterness kicking in.  M: Medium body and carbonation.  D: Super drinkable porter.

Porters are one of my favorite styles, but this one is one of the best I've had. Great roasted flavors pull through, but don't leave the burnt bite at the end. Some nice cocoa flavor, but not sweet.

The body was near black with red highlights at the edges.  S- The aroma was a solid dose of roasty chocolate and strong, roasted coffee.  T- It had a pretty complex flavor. The strongest component was of robust coffee with milk chocolate and lighter hints of nuts,smoke, and rich grains. A slight citrus flavor cleans and dries up the finish.  M- It had a medium carbonation, a slight hoppy bite, and chewy/grainy feel.  D- It's a really good drinker. It had a great flavor without being overwhelming.

Lacing left evenly around glass.  S - dark chocolate/cocoa at first with lingering hints of roasted coffee. I would compare it to a dark mocha with an extra shot of espresso. Might have been a little much for my personal tastes, but still good.  T - Unexpectedly ""hoppy."" The very first taste to hit my tongue is reminiscent to a slightly ""smoothed out"" version of an IPA. As the bitterness melts away, slight tastes of chocolate and malt seem to come into play, however they're not very prominent.  M - Smooth and creamy, but doesn't linger. Once it's gone, it's gone. Almost watery when all is said and done.  D - Drinkable. It would be easy to knock back a few of these at once, as it doesn't feel too ""heavy.""

73,226,biegaman,4.62,"A black Irish coffee with hues of brazen dark crimson when held to the light. It's undoubtedly opaque although, as stated, possesses some gleaming highlighting. An ecru stained belt is bounded round the outside with a thin splotch linking opposite ends. Lacing dots the glass.  Nowhere else can the unlikely combination of milky chocolate, freshly ground coffee and stinky, pungent hops achieve such a gloriously appetizing balance then in the Edmund Fitzgerald porter. I'd have no problem going on record as saying I doubt there will ever be a better smelling porter than this.  The flavour introduces a roasty, sooty, malt bill to the mix. It has the taste of toasted biscuits as well as singed toffee and dark, dark caramel. These flavours work alongside their companions of cold coffee, bittersweet chocolate and leafy green hop cones. De - li - cious.  The mouthfeel combines two wonderfully delicious things: the bittersweet character of unrefined cocoa beans and the resinous, bitter sensation of whole hop leafs. This has the hop intensity of a strong IPA and yet blends seamlessly with its unlikely pairings of milky chocolate and scorched malt. It is silky smooth on the palate.  If you like any of the following: hops, chocolate, coffee, porter, or beer then you should agree that the Edmund Fitzgerald is one of the most satisfying pints you could ask for.

Excellent mild hop grass. Well-rounded.  Needs a little warmth but this malt is velvety smooth - creamy as hell. Just enough hop grass to brighten it up - this is an almost quintessential example of the style.

73,226,CrellMoset,4.42,"Bottle courtesy of JohnTravolta21 - thanks!! Poured into a 12 oz. brandy snifter, which is not something I'd normally do for an American porter, but I hear this one's pretty good, haha.  Appearance: Pours a deep, rich-looking black, not completely opaque, but certainly close. The initial one-finger of creamy tan head fades at a predictable rate and leaves some nice patches and swaths of very delicate-looking lacing, though they do fade as things go along. A good start.  Aroma: The aroma on this one's really very nice. Rich, sweet, milky chocolate is at the forefront here, and it's a really great, authentic chocolate. Agitation yields some really solid earthy toast notes - never quite burnt or even smoky, but just really solid maltiness - and a leafy, slightly citrusy hoppiness which lends an intriguing bite (what's the olfactory equivalent of a bite?).  Taste: A true porter. A hearty, wide-ranging malt profile, from caramelized sugar to toasted, coffee-like astringencies, back to fudgy brownie and all the way to the crispy, nearly-burnt barley notes and a subdued but obviously present hop presence which lends a leafy twang. This one runs the gamut, and runs it pretty well.  Mouthfeel: Mild and largely creamy carbonation, with a slight hop prickle. Very clean.  Drinkability: One of the better porters I've ever tried, and rating to style brings this one way, way up. I'm not a porter man, but this is a damn good beer. 5.8% abv? Nothin' doin'.

Leaves nice patches of sticky lace as the head recedes to its final resting place.  A: Smells of coffee, roasted chocolate malts, earthy tones, and dark fruit.  T: Taste pretty much matches the nose on this one. Starts sweet with flavors of baker's chocolate, roasted coffee, and ripe fruits up front. Earthy hops are present, but pretty much stay out of the way of the malts, popping up toward the finish to give your tongue a tickle. Finishes dry and so damned smooth that you can't help but to partake more of this gift from the beer gods. This is the best tasting porter I've had yet!  M: Just a notch above medium-bodied, but I think it works perfectly. Velvety smooth, rich and creamy. Very nicely done.  D: This one ranks pretty high on my ""drinkability meter"", due to the reasonably low ABV and the absolutely fantastic flavors that mesmerize the taste buds with every glorious sip.  Notes: This is one hell of a porter! It looks great, smells great, tastes great, and feels great. What the hell else could you possibly ask for? By far, the best porter I've ever had.

S: A nice spice aroma, nutmeg, cinnamon and a bit of cocoa popped out at me. With a deeper whiff, I find a little coffee and roasty toasty familiar smell. T: Wow! This one is much more rich in flavor than I thought it would be. Roasted coffee and chocolate continues, but isn't as viscous as a stout might present. Very palatable and flavor-rich.

73,226,sgoodship,4.8,"This is my second review of this fine brew. An old favorite of mine but this was the first chance I had to sample it on-tap at the Great Lakes Brewery - doesn't get better than that.  A: Old Bottle Review. I said: Pours a very dark brown - almost black with nice mahogany brown colors visible at the edges. It has a nice coffee stained inch high head that stays with you a good part of the way. Exceptional lacing - really sticks to the glass. On-Tap: Much the same. Fine looking porter.  S: Old Bottle Review. I said: The smell is roasted malt, coffee and a little chocolatey but it is subtler than many porters. It really doesn't overpower you - just a nice dry smell. Becomes more hoppy toward the end. On-Tap: I'd say that the smell had a lot more oomph - more character.  T: Old Bottle Review. I said: The taste is what you would expect but you get some fruitiness followed by a very good hoppy bitterness that is sour and dry - very fulfilling. The great sour end dissipates back to a more coffee aftertaste. Just feels right - great taste progression. On-Tap: Great malt. Blackcurrant that I didn't pinpoint in the bottle. Amazingly well balanced.  M: Old Bottle Review. I said: Light medium body. I always expect it to be heavier in body but it may be less drinkable if it was. The carbonation is light and that seems to suit it just fine. Feels smooth and creamy on the palette and as it slips down the throat. On-Tap: More of the same - maybe more creamy.  D: Old Bottle Review. I said: Very enjoyable and exceptionally easy to drink. I think it is because it is subtle - not too complex a porter. On-Tap: Has more bold character but still amazingly drinkable. They served it too cold at the brewery. This beer really doesn't start delivering the goods until it warms up nicely.

The aroma was one of the best aspects of this fine porter. Almost overwhelming Chocolate/Espresso aromas with a hint of smoke. The flavor of this matched the taste - fantastic blend of chocolate, espresso, smoke flavoring that really left me wanting MORE! It was almost stout like. Mouthfeel is of light carbonation, and smoothness. I could sit down with this one for an evening!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,beachbum1975,4.13,"I read reviews about this beer for some time. I needed some beer for a good friend's Halloween party last night, so I grabbed a sixer. I know you are wondering - I dressed like Jenga Fett from Star Wars because I am super cool. This one was bottled on 9-19-08.  A: Pours a very dark, opaque brown - almost root beer-like with nice mahogany brown colors visible at the edges. Tan ½ head on initial pour.  T: Dark fruits, light chocolate and heavily toasted malts with a nice hoppy presence, as well. As the beer warms, there's a higher coffee essence.  M: Light to medium body, creamy and hoppy with light carbonation.  D: Very drinkable and highly sessionable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,everetends,4.45,"12 oz bottle thanks to Ckeegan and I am really stoked about this one. Served up in a pint glass.  A: Pours a very dark brown. VERY DARK brown. This should be black, but alas . . . it is not. Held to light the secret is up. Dark brown with really nice dark, ruby, blood red beams of light pouring through. Had a really nice caramel head that came up nice a slow, bubbling up from the depths of almost blackness. The Head just coats and saturates the glass. Very nice.  S: Smell is some wonderful malts. Nicely roasted malty goodness. So nice. Got some coffee coming through very nicely. Chocolate is there, but bitter sweet chocolate. There is a hint of lactose coming through as well.  T: Once again, wonderfully roasted malt kicks thi bitch off. So nice and a great sweetness. The sweetness is perfect, not too much. Coffee is light but there enough to get the point across. Semi sweet chocolate livens up the flavors a bit. Getting a bit of nuttiness in here as well, maybe hazelnut (just a touch). Cream flavors coming through as well. Very nice balance and dynamic flavors coming out of a beautiful porter taste.  M: Medium bodied brew that has amazing creaminess. So coating a creamy. Did I mention creamy. ABV is not present. This coats the mouth and leaves a really nice lactose cream flavor to linger in the aftertaste. Carbonation is just enough to crispin this beer just a bit, making in incredilby smooth and easy to drink.  D: This beer is very nice. This is absolutely the best drinking porter I have ever had. Just so easy to drink. the flavors are very nice, aroma is good, feel is great, its pretty. This porter is balla. If I had local access, absolutely would keep this as a session. Drink it if you can.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,kingothewoods,4.17,"Had this one on tap in a Michigan pub. Dark color of deep brown and a nice complete head. Smells of coffee, a little chocolate, and definitely deep roast malt. I thought this one tasted great. Usually with Porters - you get your tongue twisted with a twang of flavor, not this one. This one was smooth and not dry. Great beer, will have another one .... you should try it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,MICAMD,4.45,"A- A very very dark brown/ black with a nice, thick brown head. A very good looking beer.  S- Lots of chocolate, coffee, and a nice roastiness. Perfect balance of sweetness and roastiness. There is something special to this.  T- Chocolate, coffee. A really good balance of sweetness and roastiness. Really nicely blended and smooth. Very tasty. Everything is working really well in this beer.  M- Pretty smooth and creamy. The carbonation seems to be a bit much, but the aftertaste is nice and crisp, but not overly dry.  D- A very tasty pick. Easily one of the best porters. Get you some.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,koopa,4.42,"Received as an extra in a trade with JohnTravolta21. Thanks for the opportunity to try this awesome brew.  Appearance: Ruby highlights flow through a dark brown body with a light mocha head with fair retention and nice lacing.  Smell: what a nose...can you say coffee and chocolate all the way? well edmund fitzgerald porter can and does.  Taste: Lucuious tasting roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate blended to perfection. Really the best tasting porter I have had so far. Not overly bitter either which is nice. But of the bitterness that it does have, don't be fooled into thinking it all comes from the coffee / chocolate flavors. There is a definite hop bite in the finish which is really well done.  Mouthfeel: Actually a bit thin in my opinion but not to the point where it ruins the brew in any way. I just think this is an area for improvement.  Drinkability: excellent nose and taste combined with a slightly thin mouthfeel equals easy drinking!  Hats off to Great Lakes Brewing...",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,TheodorHerzl,4.32,"This beer pours a very dark brown color with slight ruby highlights around the edges with an inch of creamy head on it. The lacing on this beer is impressive and stayed for the entire beer. The first scents are of coffee, chocolate, and roasted grain. The smell is comforting on this cool evening. The flavor profile is spot on when I think of a porter. I get loads of dark roasted grain, caramel, coffee, and a slight chocolate taste, and a touch of hop bitterness as well. The mouthfeel though I think has a bit much carbonation, and could be toned down a bit. I am not really bothered by it, but I think it could be toned down a bit. The drinkability is very nice and would be a great session porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,John_M,4.32,"Have not had this excellent porter in some time. Had forgotten just how good it is.  The beer pours the expected very dark brown color with very good head retention and lacing. The nose on this beer is quite complex and, like the flavors on the palate, seemed to change as the beer warmed. Initially, I got a lot of licorise, cola and coffee flavors. However, as the beer warmed, the aromas tended more towards licorise, brown sugar and roasted malt. The flavors on the palate generally replicated the nose, but as the beer warmed I started to get a lot of milk chocolate as well. Very, very nice. Although moderately sweet, the beer has some nice underlying hoppiness and has a surprisingly dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is very good. I really think this beer is better served not quite so cold, as it became increasingly attractive and enjoyable as the temperature approached room temperature.  A very nice porter. Right up there with anchor as one of the best porters made that is not in the imperial style and not aged in oak. Very good beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,biergut,4.35,"Thanks to BA spointen for this bottle as an extra in a trade!  Poured in to an English pint-style glass, the color reminds me more of a deep, black stout.

I'm glad I had the opportunity to taste this one.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,bunnyhustle,4.07,"Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Pours black with deep brown edges. Off-white head with good retention and lacing. Smell seemed to be a bit muted, woke up a little as the beer warmed though. Smells of dark chocolate and coffee grounds. Taste was good. Some deep burnt grain, touch of grass or straw, some bakers chocolate and the dominant flavor was coffee. Mouthfeel was fine, a little on the light side, almost a touch watery but fine. This was a very drinkable beer. I think the thinner mouthfeel helps out with that along with the reasonable ABV. A very nice beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,OlieIPA,3.8,"A: Somewhat translucent with brown and rusty color. White head that settled quickly with very little lacing.  S: A little bit of burnt coffee characteristics followed by metallic qualities.  T: Had a little bit of bottle taste to it, but a very nice hazelnut coffee flavoring. Rich and complex.  M: Lighter body with a perfect amount of carbonation.  D: No alcohol taste at all...rich taste...therefore, very easy to drink.  Overall: Very good beer...not the best porter I've had...but a try beer for me.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,KeefD,4.28,"Dark brown/black color with ruby red highlights and a huge, fluffy, tan head. Nice retention and good lacing on this one. Nice roasted malt aroma, and plenty of hop character in the nose. Bitter chocolate throughout, coffee, toffee, burnt caramel and nice hop bitterness on the finish. A bit astringent, but not overly so. Flavors start to open up as it warms and gets better with every sip. Thick, creamy mouthfeel, average carbonation. Probably the best porter I've ever had. Very nice. Great Lakes does it again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,DoctorDog,3.94,"Presentation: 12 oz. bottle into a mug.  A- Very dark/opaque....essentially black. ~1 finger of head, which does not last.  S- Feint, but almost like burned coffee. Very mildly unpleasant, but not potent enough to either be distressing or endearing. Perhaps partially the result of diminished capacity olfactory senses in yours truly.  T- The first taste has a fairly strong, slightly unpleasantly bitter bite to it. Thankfully, the following sips quickly assuage my fears, as my perception of the flavor shifts to a crisp and almost citrusy sensation on top of the initial coffee-esque bitters. A flavor that truly improved with each passing draw. Excellent.  M- As described by many others, ""medium-light"" bodied with fairly low carbonation. Not awe inspiring, but quite good.  D- Quit high, IMO. Each taste only made me want more and more....  Future outlook: Repeat business imminent.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,kzoobrew,4.26,Pours black with deep red brown highlights when held to light. Head is a creamy khaki color which fades to a nice cap. Some sticky lacing clingy to the side of the snifter.  Smell is pleasant but slightly underwhelming. Slight coffee and chocloate notes are being picked up.  Very rich flavor up front. Dark roasted almost smoky burnt coffee up front. Some chocolate flavors hitting in there. Light citric hoppy bitterness. Definitely a full flavored brew.  While it is full flavored I would say the body is medium. There is not the thickness of a porter or stout to this brew which I enjoy. Over all the mouthfeel is smooth carobnation is some what lively.  Very drinkable. Outstanding brew all the way around. Very enjoyable.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,HollidaySlim,4.42,"Appearance -Dark and thick. Head does fade quickly.  Smell - Coffee and a hint of cocoa in the glass ( i occasionally get lights hints of burnt paper-ish smell)  Taste - Burnt roasted taste up front with a strong coffee taste in the middle and end with a little chocolate at the end too.  This is one of my favorite beers, I find it very drinkable and although a heavy brew i still find my self being able to drink 2-3 and not feel full.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,luciusgilmer,4.52,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.  A: Thick, rich, basically black porter, with rich swirling bubbles turning into a fairly weak head.  S: A nice coffee smell, which I got both from the glass and the bottle (I often can't smell much off the bottle itself).  T: Very rich flavors. Creamy. Definite coffee hints, and I kept thinking ""soil,"" which is normally a hint you'd get off a wine, so I don't know what that was. Delicious.  M: This was better than expected. Pleasantly carbonated, but smooth and creamy and easy going down. You get flavors all over the tongue, and it's a good beer to hold in the mouth a while to get them.  D: I will look for this beer again. A good one to sip, though you can drink it relatively fast due to its smoothness.  Glad I followed the ratings system here to try this one.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Hoagie1973,3.84,"Pours opaque black with a buttery tan head. Head size and retention is disappointing. As you drink it down there is some partial sheet lacing, but it disappears quickly, leaving almost nothing. However, when agitated it works back up into a thin creamy froth. Roasty aroma with hints of coffee and charred cocoa. Prominent hop presence. Everything in the nose comes through in the flavor. Especially strong is the biting, piney hops. Touch of smoke and sweetness in the finish gives way to more hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and full with just enough carbonation remaining. A good, complex beer, but the hops, though flavorful, are a little overdone for a Porter in my opinion, American or otherwise. I'm a little bored with the idea that what makes any style ""American"" is dumping an assload of hops into it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,SPLITGRIN,4.6,"I have had this before but I thought it was about time to give this great brew a proper review.  A full two fingers of rocky tan head easil reaches the top of my maudite goblet. Body is a true stout blackness. Nose is big and toasty with tons of chocolatey malt, a bit of meaty smoke, soft and attractive. I am quickly reminded of why this beer gets so much praise. With first sip you get many lovely layers of delecious complexity. Coco, dark fruit, rich malt carmel, and dry minerals all come so smooth and easy for this beer. A bit of fruity souredness is there on the mouthfeel but not harsh, actually very good. It then turns considerably thick. Very nicely drinkable, sessionable porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ColForbinBC,4.32,"12oz bottle poured into a pint  Appears a slick black body with slightly tawny edges. A tan head rose a solid finger and retreated quickly.  Aromas of bittersweet dark chocolate, roasted grains, espresso and a hint of dark fruits (black cherries and plums.)  A big lash of belgian dark chocolate and espresso dominate up front. The roasted grains fruity characteristics hold true in the middle, leading way to a very subtle citrusy hop backbone. Alcohol is extrememly well-hidden.  Carbonation is low, medium-bodied. Almost a light medium body, just a tad thin in my book.  This is one hell of an easy drinking porter. The flavors are delicious, well-balanced, and easy on the palate.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Overall a very smooth and drinkable porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ruckzuck,4.32,"A - a very dark, opaque beer that gets a bit browner when held up to light. Not a lot of head for me on this pour, but maybe I just messed it up. Looks delicious either way, and it's finally starting to get a bit chillier, so wooo porters!  S - delicious, rich roasty malt and dark chocolate dominates the nose. Did someone make some coffee in here? Oh, that's just the beer. Some caramel as well. Absolutely great smell  T - dark, bittersweet chocolate is all up in this and then some. That rich roasty goodness is in full effect, and the coffee comes through just perfectly. There's also just the right tiny amount of hop bitterness in the finish. Awesooome  M - medium bodied, a bit of carbonation, and a rockin aftertaste  D - this is one of the best porters I have had in a while. Simply delicious.

73,226,Pauly2X,4.18,"A- Extremly dark opaque reddish brown, one finger head. For all intents and purposes, black.  S- Complex roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, they're all here.  T- Slightly sweet roasted malts from front to finish. This may sound boring, however its anything but. The elegant understated complexity of the roasted malts is where this beer shines. It's as though they tell you to ""shut up and enjoy"" when you try to figure them out.  M- No complaints here.  D- For me, for a porter, this is good.  This what happens when a brewer doesn't try to reinvent the wheel and just makes a damn good beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,bound4er,4.43,"A damn good Porter - I always come back to this beer after trying other Porters - it never disappoints. Dark brown in the glass with a medium tan head that slowly recedes to a thin film that stays with the beer until finished - very nice. Roasted coffee, caramel and tree bark smells. Most of these smells carry over to the palate with a bitter chocolate note becoming prominent on the back end. This is a highly drinkable beer - having three or four in a night is not a problem.

Appearance - Dark, muddy, almost black in color with a gorgeous head that came up with ease and down with much protest. It left some cool pits on top of the liquid and some nice lacing as well.  Smell - The chocolate came across the room at the pour. Coffee grounds are very sharp and forward as well. I can pick up some darkish malt but it is mostly trumped by the coffee and chocolate notes.  Taste - There's an interesting bitterness that comes out at the taste, but otherwise the tongue follows the nose.  Mouthfeel - Close to medium-bodied with some very slight carbonation. The flavor profile here really sets off the taste buds in the front part of your tongue. A bit thin at parts which was the only complaint.  Drinkability - Definetly the best porter I've ever had, extremely impressed by Great Lakes now! Flavor was amazing and I really enjoyed the chocolate and coffee combo, well blended.

T: Starts off with a sweet caramel malt taste that slowly is balanced by hop bitterness that fades in the finish. Body has nice roasted flavors with some coffee and chocolate. M: Medium body, nice carbonation, burnt malt aftertaste. Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness. D: One of my favorite GLBC beers.

73,226,TheycallmeTim,3.24,"On-tap at Great Lakes Brewery nook in the Canton-Akron airport. Poured into a kind of weird tall skinny mug that seemed to be a promo chachki for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Whatever.  A--1 finger thick foamy lightish tan head that lasted most of the duration and left decent lacing. Body was black as stout with some deep burgundy undertones. Good looking beer.  S--Couldn't pull much because of the shape of the glass, but what I got was some wet laundry (which isn't necessarily bad) and a hint of molasses.  T--Full onrush of toasty malts up front, followed by a more mellow sweetness in the middle reminiscent of brownies with batteries baked into them. What most struck me, though, was the back end and just how overall dry a porter this is. The hops pull and linger on the aftertaste is a little much for me, though there was some nice mustiness on the finish.  M&D--Definitely more thin and dry than round and sweet--built for speed rather than comfort. While the ABV's a little up there for extended use, the drinkability's high.  It's just the taste I couldn't get into! I must be the only person on Earth who isn't wildly raving about this beer. The porter I had previous to this one was Sixpoint's Carob (aka Black Market), and I liked it much, much better. This seemed more like a hop-head's porter--which is cool, just not my style.

Complex flavors, milk chocolate again, 'dark' fruit, hints of coffee and vanilla with a hoppy bitterness at the end. Good mouthfeel, creamy and smooth. Slightly lighter body than most of this ilk and low carbonation combine to make it very drinkable.

Light and inconsistent lacing  S: Sweet roasted malt, chocolate and dark fruits (cherry, plum)ht lacing in clingy patches down the sides.  T: Tasted like it smelled. but chocolate flavor was more pronounced and blended nicely with cherry/dark fruits. Lots of flavors in this beer that were nicely balanced.

T Dense, molasses. this is a challenging session beer for me. Much more interesting than most of the dark dark beers that I have tasted. Really needs to be enjoyed from tap though.

73,226,Natural510,4,"Pours a nearly pitch-black color with fine, creamy head. Smells typically malty with coffee & cocoa notes. I detected a scent of milk as well. Dark, roasted malts with a strong coffee flavor. Cocoa backs up the coffee as well, and there is a fairly good hoppiness for a porter. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Solid take on a porter. A bit too heavy on the coffee flavor for my tastes, otherwise well drinkable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S: Smell is initially light which surprised me. Has a smell of light coffee and mild malts  T: The taste is far from light! Very complex with roasted coffee, dark cocoa and a great hop bitterness!

A very nice light-tan head with decent lacing. Smell: Smells amazing. Smells of roasted coffee, chocolate. Decadent. Taste: Wow, this is one hell of a porter. Absolutely delicious. Coffee, dark chocolate flavors dominate. Mouthfeel: A lot of porters that I've had are a little on the thin side, and this one seems a little thicker to me, which I like. Very pleasant aftertaste as well. Drinkability: Amazing. Has a nice bite, leaves me yearning for more.  Amazing beer. This would be a regular in my fridge if it were only available here. Maybe someday..",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,sundevilstudent,4.42,"Pours a dark brown/black color but with slight hints of red. Slight head leaves some intricate lacing as it recedes into the beer.  Smell is full and rich. Coffee, dark chocolate, malt, and a surprising amount of fruit make this one of the most interesting porters I've ever smelled. Fruity sweetness balances well with the strong chocolate, coffee and malt notes; it's like a three course meal complete with coffee service in a glass.  Taste: Fruit and chocolate up front work well together. Finishes with a dark roasted coffee flavor. Really complex taste makes you keep going back for more thinking you might have missed something. Dry finish on the back of the tongue contrasts nicely with the sweet flavors that occupy the front of your mouth.  This is a great beer; a solid porter with a great balance of fruit and darker flavors.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jushoppy2beer,4.3,"This is a memorable porter with a distinctive flavor. It has a dark black-coffee color with a slight head that laces nicely on the glass. The aroma is subtle roasted chocolate, which carries over to the front of the palate. Nicely carbonated, with a smoky chocolate taste that builds to a robust coffee bitterness on the finish, followed by a bitter aftertaste that lingers in the back of the mouth. Rather drinkable for a porter, but the carbonation slows it down a bit. Overall, a very nice porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,FtownThrowDown,4.1,"Can't believe I've never rated this beer. I've drank so much of this stuff and it would probably be the first beer I'd put on a home draught system. Dark brown in color with a nice frothy sheet of head on top. Taste is roasted malt, some chocolate and coffee. There are surprisingly quite a bit of hops present. Medium mouthfeel with a little bit of bitterness. Great beer, very sessionable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Stonebreaker,4.35,"Appearance: Black as molasses, thin head with an aggressive pour, decent lacing.  Smell: Typical Porter aroma, dark chocolate, coffee a wee bit of smoke.  Taste: Very smooth, dark chocolate, slight bitter from the hops, balanced out by the dark malts. When will you make a stout, Great Lakes, I'm already in line. Is it chocolate malt that gives it this flavor? One of the best parts is the finish, clean with only a slight burnt, chocolate residue.  Mouthfeel: Creamy.  Drinkability: Porter is not my favorite style, but according to the style this one is very drinkable, definitely would fit into any rotation on a night of drinking.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,kbeals,4.23,"A golden brown head complements this extremely opaque beer. The smell is your typical porter, lots of malts with coffee and chocolate undertones. Taste is very good. Malt and coffee dominate the taste, with a rather bittersweet finish. The beer was somewhat heavy and very smooth with only a slight fizziness. Overall this beer was excellent and is a definite recommendation to a fan of porters. Would definitely drink again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,coalcracker,4.42,"Appearance: Pours near black with tan head. Lacing remains in glass. Smell: Smells great- roasted chocolate, caramel and toffee in the malts. Perhaps I also taste some sweet fruits? Taste: Roasted malts are most pronounced with a dose of balancing hops that are indeed noticeable. Notes of sweet chocolate, coffee, also come into play. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. A little zing on the palate in response to the hops and sweetness. Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Not an over-the-top beer by any means.  Overall: A very tasty, well-balanced porter for those looking for a non-extreme, but well-crafted beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,kinger,4.33,"Fantastic porter, robust and full absolutely awesome. Pours a thick sticky black with a creamy tan head that lasts. The aroma is filled with dark malts and just a touch of floral hops, it is rather mild especially compared to the flavor. Once you dig into this robust porter the flavor immediately grabs you. Malts o' plenty round out the dominant flavor consisting of coffee, chocolate, and plenty of roasted malts. The floral hops become slightly more hidden beneath the intense flavor. Mouthfeel is filling and creamy. One of my favorite local brews that satisfies on tap as well as poured into a glass straight from the bottle. In my opinion this is one of Great Lakes Brewing Co's masterpieces.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,lightindarkness,4.33,"Pours a deep nearly black color with cola brown highlights and mahogany edges. A nice fluffy khaki head holds on nicely. Smells of chocolate and toasted grainy bread, burnt caramel and toffee, with a smooth full roasted balance. Taste starts off with a nice round roasted malt flavor, building with dark toasted whole grain bread and bitter chocolate. Finishes with burnt wood and some roasty bitterness. Feel is medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Kind of a slick stickiness at the finish. Very tasty. Easy to drink a lot, but full and flavored enough to be satisfied without having much more.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,kyleec,4.2,"A: poured into a glass, same color as you'd expect any porter to be, one finger head of burnt tan foam that remained through the first several sips.  S: creamy chocolate and a hint of alcohol, MAYBE something like toffee or caramel.  T: Wow. This to me is a perfect example of the style, extremely solid with no bells or whistles. A mildly bitter chocolate flavor with roasted barley and some sweetness at the end.  M/D: not too thin for a porter and pretty easy to put down. Only a faint trace of alcohol. I could drink me a few of these.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,SkeeterHawk,3.98,"I just came across a few notes that I made from reviews at Great Lakes Brewing Company this winter. Here we go  Appearance: Pours a clear dark garnet color with a lasting 1"" head that fell very slowly and left plenty of lacing on the way down.  Aroma: Clean chocolate notes with a lot of munich malt like toastiness. A slightly sweet caramel note is in there too. There are very reserved hops in this beer. Along with the toasty notes from the malt, there is also a British malt ""nuttiness"" coming out more as the beer warms.  Taste: The flavor is a little more roasty than the aroma suggested. Malt balanced with a slightly ashy flavor left behind on the back of the throat after the finish. The balance is provided as much by the dark malts as from Hops.  Opinion: This is a pretty darn good Porter. The ashy finish turns me off a little, but it isn't overpowering. I like some of the other American Porters better, but this one sure isn't bad. I would definitely drink it again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,thisisshsas,4.13,"A- appears dark brown/ black. Traditional coloring for a porter S-light smell of coffee, not overpowering at all. T- overflowing with roasted malt flavor. Some of the flavor is coffee like, other is more chocolate flavored. M- gets better the more time it spends in your mouth. D- Though it ght , it is completely full of flavor like a stout, it is light enough that you don't feel winded by the end of the beer.  One of the best porters I've ever had.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

D- when im looking for something thats hopless, this is going to be one of my first choices. i could easily kill half a sixer or more in a single sittting.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,bluemoonswoon,4.59,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Just hope its as good out of a bottle as it is on tap.  A: Pours a dark ruby brown wiht a one inch creamy toffee colored head. So its lighter than I remember but thats because the bar was dark at the time. Head fades in a few minutes into a thin half cap and ring with some light lacing. Not as good as I remember being served in the bar but then again they did have proper cleaning equipment.  S: Smell is as good as I remember it, strong resiny hops melded with rich roasted malts, absolutly stunning. Like chocolate covered grapefruit and pinenuts, good, if not better than I remember. I could smell this all day, this is the stuff they sould be pumping into the air in coffee shops or beer stores or anyplace really. Its that good!  T/MF: Thick chewy roasted coffee maltiness that melts into chocolate as the beer lingers on my tongue. The hop profile seems to be a bit muted compared to the one I was served at the bar but this is still a great tasting beer. Good feeling struck between dryness and creamy sweetness. Mild tobacco graces the flavor profile in the long and lasting finish.  D: This beer is once again amazing, a little worse for wear when sampled out of the bottle but still a fantastic beer. Dangerously drinkable and would have scored higher if I had not already had this one on tap.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,brewandbbq,4.17,"Pours dark mahogany with amber hues on the edges. A half-inch head of beige had moderate retention and smears of lacework lasted throughout.  Roasted coffee, dark malts, caramel, nougat, and oreo shells fill the nose. Very clean and balanced, with a high level of complexity for a porter.  Fullish bodied, shy of thick. A happy medium between chewy and ordinary. Creamy.  Roasted malt, coffee, bitter chocolate, and an underlying fruit note lead off the pallet. A firm, drying bitterness follows through along with brownie bits and biscuits.  Finishes with lingering bitter chocolate, and fading cookie crumbs.  Nice job on this one, very quaffable without being boring.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

This beer pours a dark espresso brown with just a thin beige head that subsided into a just a thin line along the edges of the glass. The aroma is chocolate, coffee and vanilla. The taste is wonderful. Full roasted malts and chocolate in the front with the astringency of coffee coming out on the tail. The mouthfeel is great. Much fuller then most porters, feels almost like a stout. This is an extremely drinkable porter, probably one of the best I've had.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,mentor,4.25,"09/27/08 4376DL, a gift from fiver29...thanks for the opportunity. Pours a strong three-finger tan-brown head over a clear very dark-brown liquid with mahogeny highlights. Smells cream, coffee, minimal chocolate. Overall, a simple and dry nose. Some hop grassy, perhaps williamette?  Tastes wonderful. Smooth roast with strong hop flavor with a supporting creaminess. Just and amazing balance between the coffee flavor and a dash of acrid, like coffee on the burner too long. The roast taste very much like chewing on a tiny piece of fresh roast unmalted barley. Has an herbal supporting hop character that fills out the roast and ties in a mild chocolate. Dry from the roast and a sour sting (acrid from roast or could be carbonation), yet the mouthfeel keeps the little malt sweet on the tongue. Great balancing act.  Mouthfeel is md-thick and wonderful. Carbonation is mild and works well with the flavors. Drinkability suffers a bitas it becomes a bit too dry roasty near the end of the glass. One is definitely enough.  Edit: With the last sip, the hops come across as a bit oily or gritty tettnanger-like. Nice combination.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,DoubleJ,4.47,"Single bottle from Lone Hill Liquor, on to the beer:  Opaque body, the head tinted with tan. The aroma is big on power, lots of semi-sweet chocolate and mild roasted coffee notes. Great flavor too, very well rounded and goes down easy. Again, semi-sweet chocoalte with a roasted edge. At times, it reminds me of licking chocolate cake batter off the mixer. I'll have another please, but I'll need to drive 30 miles to find the (rare) store that carries these locally.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,roadhouse,4.35,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appears a very dark brown, with red highlights. One finger tan head leaves a little lacing.  Aroma of chocolate, coffee, wet wood, smoke, and vanilla cream.  Flavor is off the charts. Starts off with a big burst of creamy chocolate which evolves into something like mocha coffee, only much smoother. Finish has a nice touch of sweetness and a smoky flavor that doesn't get in the way of the hops.  Mouthfeel is amazing. Such a smooth texture. Medium bodied, carbonation level is perfect.  Now this is a sessionable porter. I am unsure whether I like this or Anchor Porter more in the American Porter category. Amazing stuff. I'm usually hesistant to buy a whole six pack of something I haven't really tried but I'm really glad I did with this one. The only thing that bums me out is that I have to make a trip to Illinois to get it. We need this stuff in Northwest Indiana!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Aftertaste is just a touch astringent and sweet...sits on the tongue nice and begs to be sipped. Profile is husky malts that keeps things even and the cocoa crusted coffee beans move about freely  goes down smooth and has a slight creamy texture to it. Nice balance of flavors.

Strong cocoa taste in the finish, with the hops coming a tad later. The result is a quite pleasant bittersweet coffee aftertaste.  M - Very creamy and thick with moderate carbonation.  D - You could could a few of these back in an evening, but this is a very heavy beer, so you couldn't drink too many.

Lovely chocolate and roasted malt characteristic as warming on the body and the coffee flavor comes through.

It has notes of caramel with a strong dark roasted malt presence that has a deep roasted espresso character.  Taste/Mouth feel: Its flavor has deep chocolate roasted malts with flavor notes of coffee and cream with bittersweet chocolate. The hops play well off the malt and further develop the bittersweet chocolaty flavors before slowly fading out into the finish. The palate is smooth, creamy and slightly slick with mild carbonation and a medium to full body.  Notes: Outstanding.

73,226,errantnight,4.8,"Thank you DontCallMeSurly for this awesome extra.  Sometimes it can be hard to pick out a regular, year-round release of a style that doesn't have the bombast or peculiarity or hype of others and say... this is truly a great beer. Cool to see that this beer is acknowledged for its greatness.  Pours a deep black that's almost entirely opaque, but a crystal clarity allows for some ruby highlights around the edges with a clean finger or two of frothy head with attractive lacing all the way down and a long last to the topping suds, which lead a strong, chocolate-centric aroma to the nose. Dark chocolate and mocha coffee, a deep, almost burnt roastiness, dark caramel and strongly ripe fruit around the edges.  Taste is.... well, it's perfect, for a porter. A medium-rich, chocolate and coffee roastiness with toffee-like sweetness just barely evening things out, no real hop flavor except perhaps the impression of spicyness from a clean, even bittering that's not acrid from darkly roasted malt. It's not rich and heavy, you can drink this. Exceptionally clean.  Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-full, and never heavy. Carbonation is moderate and lifting without being spritzy or bloating.  I love dark beers... but the ones that I taste and have a desire to session are few and far between. At nearly 6% that would be a helluva drunken session, but here's to a beer that is great at what it is, non-assuming, and just fantastic. A favorite.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Lnedrive14,4.32,"Picked up a 6-pack when I was in Chicago. Very excited and happy to finally get my hands on this one.  A: Pours almost black with a light head and bit of cola-like bubbles floating in there. Looks very light, not syrupy at all.  S/T: Huge smell up front. Fills the room up with a bit of smoke, coffee, roasted malts. Surprising bit of a little sweetness in the aftertaste. Very pleasant. It is pretty overpowering up front with a lot of flavors, but very mellow as it rounds out. .  M/D: Very light in the body with a ton of carbonation. If taste were factored out of this beer, it almost feels like a lager in your mouth. Very smooth and the taste permeates every corner of your mouth. Drinkability is good, but it is kind of a strong flavor, so after about two of them it is pretty overwhelming.  Really a great porter, a strong addition to an often overlooked style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,daythree16,4.23,"Poured into a pint glass. Very close to black in color with a one finger head that leaves a nice amount of lace.  The aroma is of burnt chocolate and bitter coffee. The taste is chocolatey sweet up front with coffee and bittersweet tones and a bitter finish. Very well rounded.  The beer has a medium to heavy mouthfeel, and on taste alone a very high drinkability.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,allergictomacros,4.97,"A - Pours a clear dark ruby red, with a very very solid head of sticky tan foam. Kinda jiggles like jello. Maaaybe could lace a touch better, but really, we're nitpicking now.  S - Huge aromas waft out upon pouring. Toasted grains, molasses, dark sugars, some pungent fruitiness as well. Toasted seaweed - don't get that very often....  T/M - Slightly sweet, with a creamy nuttiness, then BAM. Big hit of bitter espresso. Slightly thick body is smooth and chewy, but very clean - doesn't have that slick, oily feel. Might be the touch of astringency that does that. Lots of toasted graininess and a finish hop bitterness.  D - A superior brew. Ridiculously drinkable, extremely tasty, well that's about it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Oxymoron,2.96,"I have a sinking feeling on this one. Pours clear black color with dark brown hues throughout. Red around the edges. A light tan colored head with good retention and lacing Though did die out completely.  The nose is mostly malty with some underline sour notes. To start there is a stronger roasty note with some minor coffee and toffee backings. Some minor chocolate and yeasty notes. There is a lactic almost sour note that comes out more as it warms. Very offsetting. Some minor esters, figs mostly and a touch of earthy hops  The taste is bit more balance. A good complexity malty taste but a still stronger roasty flavor dominates other flavors. The chocolate notes come out stronger than the nose indicated. Some coffee and a bit of a peaty/smoky note as well. The sourness is gone but there is a subtle infection taste that I just can't get past. Boardline butyric. Some lacto more of a oats flavor and minor esters.  The body is moderate with a light carbonation. This is just an off flavored beer. You could say it's little fishy.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,JohnGalt1,3.65,12oz received in trade from Wasatch.. I've had this brew a few times over the years.. but this is the first time I've ever sat down and took notes or reviewed it. Poured into my Sam Adams shaped glass.  3 finger light tan head drops leaving spotty lacing atop a very dark brown and very clear brew... even the highlites are dark brown.  Aroma is mainly chocolate and burnt sugar.. but in a good way.. smells thick..  Flavor is the same as the nose but with touches of coffee and some background hop bitterness that could easily be mistaken for dark grains. Plenty of malty sweetness to tie it all together with some lingering fruitiness and a touch of vanilla on the finish.  I remember the body being bigger and for that matter the hoppiness.. but I'm not complaining.. all and all.. a very nice porter.. I just wish I would have picked up a Black Butte tonight to try them side by side.  Thanks John..,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,TheMistler,4.67,"Pours opaque, dark. After you've thinned out the quantity a bit you notice surprising coloration - richly hued brown instead of black. Off-white head, tan-to-brown, clingy.  Strong coffee aroma.  I was initially surprised at the level of carbonation, but pleasantly. Not too much. Nice dry, roasty nut maltiness with a moderate sweetness. A ""parched"" aftertaste similar to that of black coffee. This beer sticks around your palate for a while - thankfully, given how much I enjoyed it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,csmiley,4.47,"A - Pours dark brown and opaque in color. In the right light some reddish brown shows up on the edge. Head was light brown and topped out at about three quarters of an inch. Retention was good with the head taking a while to fade into a nice cap. Lacing was quite good.  S - A nice wave of dark malt comes from this beer immediately. Roasted aromas, smokey aromas, coffee aromas, chocolate aromas, latte aromas, the list goes on. Everything comes together and has a balance that is very nice.  T - More dark malt hits the palate pretty quick. Roasted flavors are apparent first with coffee and smoke forming a solid backbone behind it. Sweeter flavors hover arond the end. Mostly chocolate with some milk thrown in. Some fruit is there but very hard to pick out. Could be cherry or blackberry.  M - Medium bodied with good carbonation. Finish starts out sweet but that fades quickly into a nice bitterness that sticks around for a bit. Smooth is the best word to describe it.  D - Drinkability is very good. There is nothing in the beer that is completely overwhelming making for a great all around beer. Alcohol is hard to detect. Highly recommended brew if you can get it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,DarkerTheBetter,4.18,"This beer pours a dark brown that is clearer towards the edges and glows with a cherry color when held to the light. The head is a sandy tan cream that stays around for a while.  Smelsl of a touch of smoke, sweet caramel, banana and green grape, but still manages to stay dry.  Tastes of roasted barley, smoke and sweet coffee. The smoke fades to a tart strawberry in the finish accompanied by a touch of 2% milk.  Feels a little frothy for my taste, but it's still clean and slick.  A tasty take on the style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,throwitallaway,4.08,"Thanks to saucya for this one! Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Dark with a small head that fizzles away quickly. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, and that's about it. While the aroma lacks, the taste makes up for it quite a bit. Tons of chocolate and roasted malt, with a little bit of sweetness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Drinkability is quite high as I could definitely put down several of these with ease. Not exactly a complex beer, but fuck, who needs that all the time? Overall, this is a solid, pleasurable beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Super head retention & good lacing  S: Cocoa, a bit of coffee, not much else  T: Chocolate, roasted grain, a touch of licorice & some burnt caramel up up front. A whisper of coffee & dryness as this warms, with some dark fruit on the edge of the tongue (figs & cherry). Finishes with milk chcolate, carob, a touch of molasses & chicory & a touch of creme brule at the end  MF: Slick, with medium carbonation, creamy smoothness comes through as this warms  Drinks too easy, there would be no problem sessioning on this.

Almost one finger of light tan head faded back leaving no lacing on the glass. Aromas of toasted chocolate and coffee malts.  Taste is more toasted malt, more so coffee than chocolate. Hints of vanilla and caramel lurk in the flavor. A slightly bitter aftertaste follows.  The feel is kinda thin and watery, the carbonation is a bit high. Both are about right for the style. Drinkability is good though. The high carbonation detracts from it a bit, but the low ABV (5.8%) and light feel make it almost sessionable.  A very good porter. I only wish it was available in my area.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The aroma is a delicious smelling mix of roasted malts, caramel, coffee and a prevelant smokey feel.  The taste is similar to the aroma but goes even deeper with notes of toffee and caramel sweetness, cocoa powder, and roasted malts with a nice prickly tingle of hop bitterness running through it. Finishes with a bittersweet mix of coffee tones and sticky sugars. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with an excellent smooth, creamy and easygoing feel.  This is probably my favorite staple brew from the GLBC and is just a damn fine American Porter, chock full of roasty notes, lip smacking sweetness, and easy drinkibility.

Aroma is malty, bitter chocolate, dark fruits, and some coffee as it warms. Initial flavor is sweet chocolate and coffee. Flavor ends similarly, but with some malts and hops to complicate the flavor, let leaving it balanced. Some lacing, limited carbonation, medium body, and limited alcohol presence.

S: Chocolatey, slightly bitter. T&M: More roasted flavors then I was expecting given the nose, slightly astringent and drying on the tongue. Well attenuated, it doesn't come across as ""rich"" but, not watery. D: This is a very nice porter in the English tradition, not very hoppy, this is a malt dominated beer.

Roasted coffee and caramel dominate the aromas.  Taste was both rich and full, loaded with roasted coffees and burnt chocolates. Flavors of dark fruits and some light, crisp hops finish it off. All around perfect blend of flavor.  The only area this beer suffers (ever so slightly) is the mouthfeel. I was expecting a thick, creamy feel to match the taste. Instead, it seemed a bit light with more active carbonation. But now I'm just nitpicking.  Excellent brew.

Definite dark fruit smell as well with a very nice faint hop smell to balance everything. One of the better porters I've smelled.

Smells of a french roast with a sweet element. Bittersweet is how I could best describe it. Slight sweetness behind a strong roasted smell. Just how I want a porter  Taste is of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. It has a decent malty sweetness on first touch, and finishes with a surprising bitterness considering the lack of a hop nose.

A sandy tan head persists and leaves some nice lacing.  Smell is of sweet coffee: half French roast, half honey? Combined with dark, baked fruits, like caramelized apples and burnt sugar ready to be made into pies. Perhaps the most inviting aroma I've experienced. The wonderful sweetness of the smell simply can't be overstated.  Taste is as expected based on smell: lingering coffee and subtle dark chocolate persist throughout with the fruity sweetness perfectly counterbalanced by the bold hops and charred malt.

The aroma was a sweet, roasted coffee taste, as if someone was cutting fresh vegetables while roasting fresh coffee beans.  The taste is amazing. The caramel malts are present, but balanced, nicely topped off with the rich chocolate roast and flavorful, but not bitter, coffee taste. The roasted taste lingers on the side of the tongue while the refreshing caramel comes back sip after sips No flavor ever becomes overwhelming.

The palate is roasty up front, with some dark chocolate, a little coffee and a faint hint of smoke. A little caramel comes through on the mid-palate. Drying, roasty and with a little licorice on the finish, this beer is a little bit like The Abyss.

The taste is very roasty with coffee, barley, and cocoa as the nose belied. There is a dry hoppy bitterness in the finish that is just right for the beer.  The mouthfeel is very robust for a porter, and I found it quite refreshing after drinking the ABC Milestone Cask Porter a few minutes before.

Appearance- Beer pours not quite black with thick clingy lacing, more of a darkened amber with red hues shining through. I can see the sports playing on the TV behind when I hold it up. One finger deep lingering head.  Smell- Roasty and malty with much hop presence. More roasted barley than chocolate, but chocolate persists. Hops are pretty strong, but not overpowering.  Taste- Roasty, hoppy and smooth with yeasty esters, but outside of that.. The tap is not clean, and the beer is infected, showing big metallic traces. This is clearly not the ideal venue for reviewing. First I had this problem here with Founders Dirty Bastard, now this. Tastes off, but I wouldn't blame Great Lakes. Unfortunately, to the untrained drinker, that's exactly what will happen.  Mouthfeel- Thin and metallic. Quite astringent. Normally the beer is creamy and smooth, lightly carbonated.  Drinkability- Normally I would give this beer about a 4 or 4.5 on drinkability, but this time I have to give it a 1. I couldn't even finish this one. No more of these today.

73,226,ProudBeerSnob,4.48,"This brew is one of all-time faves, but first time to review it.  Poured from bottle marked ""Best by 6/27/08"" into a standard pint glass. Very drak brwon to black with a 1"" khaki colored head that provides good lacing.  I've got a bit of a cold, so the aroma is tough. Smells a bit dry, with a little bitter chocolate aroma. So well balanceed, I almost want more ""bite.""  I've had some other unbalanced porters recently that had TOO MUCH roasted aromas and tastes. Not the Fitz. Just enough to make it taste like a porter, but not too much to make it a one pint only affair.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,JDV,3.7,"-bottle ordered from Archer Liquors Dark brown pour with a slightly transluscent look to it, giving it a ruby tint. Nice tan head. Chocolate and coffee roast dominate the aroma as to be expected here. Flavor is solid, with a standard roastiness and bittersweet chocolate like flavor, but the body is a tad thin. Nicely balanced beer, good flavor, and enjoyable, but could benefit from a bit more body. Very much worth trying.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Blanchette,4.92,"I am rating this beer for what it is -- a sessionable porter. It's not going to be mindblowing, and nor will be an entirely unique offering. It is the type of beer that invites you to toss down three in a couple of hours. Maintains a robust porter taste in your mouth for 30 minutes after the bottle; but doesn't overpower you during drink. I am very happy to see this beer in the Top 100, despite the fact that it's not a barnburning 11% stout. This is a pure porter; what comes to mind when one thinks a standard, rich afternoon beer. Top quality.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Lothore,4.28,"Poured into my awesome new Kuhnhenn pint glass, thanks adam!  A- Pours a deep mahogany color letting almost no light pass through. A small one finger head tops the beer however it stays there for quite a while.  S- Smell is predominately roasted malts, a bit of sweetness. Not the most aromatic brew but decent none the less.  T- This is what I think a porter should taste like. Roasted malt flavor which leads into slight hints of coffee with an underlying sweetness the fades to a touch of hop bitterness in the end. Not an extreme brew by any means just well balanced and easy drinking.  M- Medium viscosity with quite a bit of carbonation, makes for easy drinking.  D- It's great to see a top 100 beer that is not so extreme. I've gotten tired of giant bash your face in stouts and imperial porters where I feel like i've been hit by a freight train after each sip. This is a welcome break from that complexity and just brings to the table a simple, good porter. Definitely an excellent session beer, I would not hesitate to seek this out again and again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,spointon,4.42,"First I'll admit, this is the beer that turned me on to porters and I still consider it my benchmark for the style.  A= This beer pours a deep dark brown with just a hint of mahogany reddish tint. The head is thin but remains throughout.  S= This beer has a fantastic smell of roasted malt with a hint of mollasses sweetness. There is also a tiny bit of hops detectable in the scent.  T= Taste is where this beer shines. It is so incredibly balanced that the sweetness of the barley, the roasted chocolate maltiness, and the hops all combine to make a very pleasurable sipping beer.  MF= This beer is nicely carbonated and a pleasure in the mouth.  D= I really love this beer and would go out of my way to have more!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,NCBeernut,4.17,"Thanks to Tilley4 for this one...  Looks brown, but light shining through shows deep ruby hues. Unimpressive bubbly head that fades away quickly.  Tons of cocoa, freshly brewed coffee and caramel in the nose as well as the taste. In the taste some toasted grains add a nice complement. More sweetness than bitterness from the coffee and chocolate. Not overly rich; I could almost session on this.  A fine porter for sure.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S - 4 words; Roasty, Chocolate, Coffee. Awesome. T - All of the smell but some floral and slightly citrus hops come through as well. M - Medium to full bodied, low to medium carbonation. D - A very nice porter indeed. I would drink this on a very regular basis if it was available here.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Darien,4.38,"A-poured into a 12 oz. pint glass, average head with ok retention and nice lacing, very dark reddish rown color.  S-Big roasty/toasty and smoked aromas right up front.  T-A little chocolatey on first sip, but there are big roasted malt flavors also, and they're not overpowering like the smell had me thinking.  M-Medium bodied, not watery but not really thick and chewy, which works well here.

M-a little chewy, the bitterness lingers on the tongue.  D-fairly light but not really a session beer.  I liked this beer but I think I expected too much. Nice but not mindblowing.

73,226,SaCkErZ9,4.57,"Thanks to limesmut for this one. Best by date of 9/11/07.  Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pitch black with a touch of blackberry colored highlights. Tan, mocha colored one finger sized head. Sporadic lacing.  Aroma is beautiful. Chocolate, coffee, toffee, caramel malts. I would have a hard time distinguishing this one from a stout based on aroma. I guess not quite as roasty as a stout, but pretty damn close.  Wonderful stout like flavors as well. Big chocolate flavors with the sweet coffee background to lend a bit of balance.  Maybe a little too much carbonation for me, but otherwise, nearly perfect mouthfeel. Medium bodied, on the light, but it should be. Super long finish wiht the coffee sticking around forever. A more drinkable porter I could not imagine.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Homerbag,4.17,"Pitch black with one finger thick head that retains well and leaves a sticky lace down the glass.  Smells of toasted malt, coffee, burnt chocolate. Very pleasing. The aroma alone is woth cracking one open. Taste is full and rich with malt, some caramal and toffee, followed by more of a coffee tone when it warms up. Hops calmly bite at the back of the palate creating a nice bitter balance. Feel is great, creamy, not too thick, and inviting of more drinks.  Eventhough porters are not my favorite style, if more of them were like this I would probably change my mind. A pleasure to drink and worth the trip to the beer store.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,svraines,4.13,"Liquid roast delivery system....mmmm  Poured into imperial pint glass, got 2-fingers of light tan foam, gets rocky and slowly condenses into a compact head. The foam has a brightness too it that makes it closer to near-white on top of tan.  A quick sniff gives a hint of what to expect, but subtle. Careful you'll want to keep sniffing to see if you can get a bigger whiff, just take a drink.  For me I don't get chocolate or coffee flavors directly, it is pure roasty malt flavors. If you chew on chocolate malt you know the flavors. Some of the components of dark chocolate flavor is there, but I don't get enough to where I think it tastes like chocolate. It was great with some dark chocolate truffles though, an early V-day gift got shared with me. After it goes down the hatch, there is some sweetness, but it doesn't linger as a hop bitterness and then mild astringency clear the tongue of any residual sweetness prepping your mouth for another gulp.  The head portends the exceptional mouthfeel. The thick, epresso-crema-like residual it leaves down the side of the glass translates into very creamy tiny bubbles exploding the roasty flavor all over your tongue.  No flaws in this one, very drinkable, but the slight drying of your tongue after each drink would catch up with you after a while.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,riboflavin88,3.93,"This beer had a beautiful color in the glass, deep brown and tan. Its nose primarily featured a strong coffee presence. The taste also had strong coffee notes with chocolate, and cigar toward the end. Also a distinct malt flavor, very tasty. A lot of depth to this brew, many layers.

73,226,chiefydawg,4.5,"Obsidian with a dark crimson glow to the spot you hold up to the light. Small but compact khaki head and lace clinging to the sides for dear life as the liquid sinks.  Smells of roasted chocolate, coffee, and some hop without being overpowering in any one. Smells fresh and beer-like still.  The roastiness steps up for the taste. The high-cocoa dark chocolate is appealing. Dry and simply luscious. The mild idea of sweetness is truncated quickly at the swallow, where the hops march in and wash away the residue. They should make a hard candy with this stuff. At least my dentist could use a new boat...  Medium bodied and silky smooth. The right carbonation for the job. This is a nice sipper to savor, and would go well with most chocolate or vanilla desserts. Really a great weekend/vacation breakfast brew too, now that I think of it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Floydster,4.38,"12 ounce bottle received in a trade with pimpp, drank this after my friends left tonight as a nightcap  Poured into my Chimay goblet with a black color that had red highlights, especially in the light, nice 3/4 foamy tan head, nice retention, and some incredible lacing  Smell had ground coffee beans that had a sweet sugary scent to them, some hints of chocolate and hops, roasted malt, and smoky aromas  Taste was great, coffee right up front to go along with smoked dark malt, both charcoal and caramel are present, a little bit of hops in the aftertaste provided a complex balance, some molasses later in the drinking experience surfaced, also a faint flavor of dark fruit, particularly dried raisins, thought this beer would be overrated but I was definitely wrong, as it got warmer the roasted malt started to shine through a provide a nice somewhat chewy but very dry taste, taste did not away for several minutes, big rich flavor that makes you want more and more  Body was thick for a porter and had a nice long lasting flavor, carbonation was a little overboard in my opinion though, smoky and creamy mouthfeel  Highest drinkability for a porter that I have ever tasted, would make a great session beer during the winter, super light on the stomach, a low ABV, fantastic smoothness, not much more you could ask for from this one as far as this category goes, could drink all night, six pack easy and you cannot say that about many beers from this style  Best beer I have from Great Lakes along with their Blackout Stout, wish I had a case of these to get me through the next cold weeks of February, highly recommended, cannot wait to try more of this soon, no doubt about it that this one belongs on the top one hundred list",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,rayjay,4.85,"I haven't reviewed a beer in quite some time, and I only do it when I'm confident that the beer I'm drinking is very fresh and properly handled. I just received this from the Black Booty BIF 08, dated best by 6/18/08, a full 5 months away.  Deep cherry brown. The carbonation is subtle yet the lacing is world-class, as is the head retention.  Dusty chocolate malt aroma with strong hints of baker's chocolate, fresh baked chocolate bread, and sweet carmel. Very strong aroma, and for a beer that isn't very carbonated too. No detectable hops. The aroma reminds me of cask ale, and no doubt this beer would be a slam dunk cask-conditioned.  Strong notes of creamy, sweet coffee and chocolate. Very deep and complex flavor profile. Robust flavors don't mean that it isn't easily drinkable though. In fact, this may be one of the smoothest porters I've ever had. Low alcohol black beers like this are becoming my favorite session beers. Very smooth and enjoyable bitterness, which is perfectly balanced by the sugary sweetness. Slight tartness. Coffee with cream and sugar. The complex aftertaste lasts for over 10 minutes.  The mouthfeel is perfect as well, with a soft carbonation not unlike a nitro beer. The lingering sweetness and bitterness are offset by the medium-light mouthfeel, making it even more drinkable. Without all those prickly bubbles it feels even more like a cask ale.  Drinkability is...lets just say that this is the perfect session ale, period. It inspired me enough to write my first review in about a year.  Very English-inspired. I still can't get over how big the nose is without huge bubbles to carry it. Seek and consume.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

A teaspoon of cherry cordial comes and goes with a quickness. Hint of roasted nuts. Resinous pine hop presence provides a touch of balancing bitterness. Piney, mocha-ish finish.

A few folks have pointed out prunes and/or dark fruits, but they're not particularly strong or noteworthy.  It's not the most complex blending, but it's flavorful, well integrated, and robust.

73,226,SilentSabre,4.17,"The guy who lives across the street from me brought me back an assortment of Great Lakes after visiting his family in Cleveland for the holidays. So thanks to my neighbor, Bill, for the opportunity to try this beer that I have been wanting to try for so long. It poured a bit lighter than I was expecting; a very dark reddish brown colour which easily allowed light to pass through. It is, however, a porter, so I don't know why I expected this to be inky black. The head was a khaki coloured foam approximately a finger and a half thick. It subsided to about a quater of an inch in about 60 seconds, but was easily agitated to resume its fullness with a simple ""swish"" of the glass. Smell asserted itself nicely with plenty of unsweented cocoa. Very little, if any coffee or caramel, or any of the other nuances that typically accompany one another in a beer of this sort. This one seemed to me to be nearly exclusively unsweetened cocoa powder with a bit of roasted grain hiding in there some place. I didn't find the smell of this particularly complex, but it was pleasant nevertheless. Taste was mildly sweet with the cocoa from the smell asserting itself in the taste, as well. The sweetness quickly waned and turned pleasantly bitter, then a lovely dry, roasted cereal grain flavour. This is a nice porter. Mouthfeel is neither too heavy nor too thin. Quite drinkable. If you enjoy porters you should certainly have a go this.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jeonseh,4.36,"Got this out of a Great Lakes Sampler Pack.  Color is a deep brown, with a golden and amber hue mixed in. A nice thick head pours down through it and remains throught the drink leaving solid lacing throughout.  The smell is rather malty and mostly hints of caramel is what appears to me.  The taste is great. At first, I get hit with a burst of malt that taste like caramel and even a hint of vanilla and a light roasted coffee, taste mixed in as well that balances greatly.  Not too much carbonation on the mouthfeel but leaves a sticky feeling in the mouth in a good way; has a nice body too it as well as I like having a porter that have some ummphh behind it.  The drinkabilty on this is great as I have to say this is one porter that is balanced very well and one that I could drink repeatedly.

Quick taste of hops and chocolate in the beginning. Followed by a very burnt, roasted malt taste.  Great mouthfeel. Very thick, which is great for a porter. Nice smoothness.  Great beer in the winter. Could drink a few of these, which is all one would really want out of a porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,bassmantin,4,Pours a fairly dark brown with minimal tan head.  Smell is excellent. Coffee and roasted malt aromas. Very deep and rich but perhaps a bit too sweet.  Taste is also quite good. Definitely not too sweet as I had feared. The coffee/roasted malt flavor presents itself immediately. The hop finish on this beer is quite unique for a porter. It's fairly strong and persistent but not overwhelming or unbalancing.

73,226,younger35,4.3,Got this bad boy as an extra in a trade with BeerTruth (god love em). This is my first brew from Great Lakes and Im pumped to try this one. Drank from a POM pomegranate glass (Im at work).  Appearance- Pours a medium brownish with hints of amber on the parts where light penetrates. This brew looks a lot like cola. Forms a nice two finger light brown head that fizzes wildly and recedes fairly quickly leaving a good cap and collar. Zero lacing is left although Im contributing that to the fact that this glass is rather dirty. Smell- Start very fruity with an almost chocolate covered raisins start. Plenty of sweet milk chocolate and bitter espresso. Hints of hazelnut and vanilla start to show a bit more as it warms. Very interesting nose that is much fruitier than any Porter Ive recently tried. Taste- Oh so much roasted malt envelopes my entire mouth leaving an almost burnt coffee taste. I definitely get way more coffee than chocolate in this one at first but as it warms the chocolate becomes a bit more evident. Something is very rustic about this brew. Almost a root beer like flavor that hides underneath. Finishes with a semi bitter citrus kick before the coffee boots it out of the way and takes charge. Mouthfeel- Medium crisp body with a nice zesty carbonation. Drinkability- This is a great beer and I cant imagine not being able to sit down and guzzle a six pack. Its got everything a Porter should have. Solid beer that I cant wait to have constant access to when I move back home to Chicago. Deschutes Black Butte does now indeed have a replacement!

73,226,pwoods,4.45,"12oz. brown bottle, purchased at Party Source, poured into an imperial pint.  A: Pours deep brown with clear visibility when held to the light. 1 1/2 fingers of light tan fluffy head. Good retention and some lacing.  S: Red grapes and milk chocolate body. Light cola with clean malts.  T/M: Nice chocolate body and undertones of French roast coffee. More of the cola flavor with a hint of vanilla. Body is medium and very creamy.  D: Just a damn good porter. Very tasty, sessionable, and a staple in my fridge.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jeffmonarch,4.15,"On tap in a pint glass at 69 taps in Akron OH.  A - Dark brown color with no head. The bartender poured all of the beers to the rim and didn't allow room for head. It's ashame they didn't know anything about beer but at least they were cute.  S - Chocolate and coffee  T - Smooth chocolate flavor.  M - Good carbonation all the way through. Full bodied.

73,226,meechum,4.65,From a trade with Almalkin. This may very well be the best porter I've had yet  A - Poured a dark black almost motor oil consistancy into a pint mug with a large frothy tan head that fell extremely slowly into a thick lacing down the glass while maintaing a halo of froth on top of the brew the entire way down  S - Big coffee smell with a hint of biscuit and a little fruitiness in there also and then just a whiff of grassy hops in the nose also  T - The taste was spot on for a porter in my opinion. Nice bittersweet of the coffee and caramel/tofee with a hint of spicy fruit and then a nice hoppy finish at the end to give it a dry crisp ending on the palate...excellent  M - The mouthfeel was also on point with a nice thick feeling without it being to thick and it coming off as a stout. Good carbonation but not overdone delivers all the flavors to the back of the palate  D - I really regret that I only got two in the trade and will be working out future trades for much larger quantities..this is a beer that would make me consider relocating,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,OWSLEY069,4.3,"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, a big roasty malt, with hints of cocoa and caramel. In the taste, roasty malt, a nice coca presence and a nice ending hop presence too. A smooth bitterness, medium body mouthfeel and a roasty malt and cocoa aftertaste. Fantastic porter, nice hop presence.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,indy169,4.38,"This caramel black colored porter from GLBC of Cleveland Ohio is remarkable. So often porters are dull and sludgy, but not here.Rich lacing, pleasant nose, and an exciting quaff. Taste is toasted-full without any rough edges. This is a porter that is full of life and soul. Bravo.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,clemsonbrewer,4.28,Pitch black liquid with a thick tan head. Little retention and no lacing. Sweet chocolate malt and good porter smell. There's a slight hint of piney hops lingering. Chocolate porter taste that leaves a dry taste on the palate. Nice big malt chewy feel. A great porter. Definitely worth it.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Slatetank,4.73,"Decanted cool from a 12oz brown bottle into a tulip. Purchased from Capone's in Norristown.  A - The deepest mocha brown imagineable crested by a fluffy sandstone head. The head settles from about 2.5 fingers of large gaps into a very fine bead. The lace forms like a tan halo.  S - A scrumptuous aroma of subtle pine combines w/ a roasted and sweet smell. A big dark roast and dark cocoa scent w/ subtle fruity ale aromas.  M - A magnificent blend of malty dry and sweet creamy textures. There is a light acidity from a gentle citrus hop note. The carbonation is perfect for the style and enhances the roastiness w/ a tinge of smokey char.  T - A fabulous porter in flavor, the nuances are just spot-on w/ dry roasted, creamy and spice flavors all working in harmony. The chocolatey and biscuity flavors while smooth and creamy coffee notes ar layered oh-so-well. A nice hop flavor is unobtrusive and keeps you coming back. I notice fruity esters and hints in the light yeastiness. Magificent roasted grain that just casually appears as the merry-go-round of greater porter flavor dances across the tongue.  D - I probably couldn't find a more drinkable dark ale. This is a world class beer through and through. One of my favorite styles and Great Lakes nails it. This is a classic American porter w/ excellent drinkability.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,drseamus,4.38,"Pours dark brown with a quarter inch off white head; just like a porter should. Aroma is filled with roasted dark malt, coffee, and chocolate. The flavor is pretty damn good. Roasted malt and coffee lead this bad boy off and they're followed up by a bit of chocolate and a tiny touch of caramel. The aftertaste features the chocolate more prominently. There is a bit of detectable carbonation on the tongue and it has a medium to heavy body. All around a great sessionable beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Smells of coffee, roasted malts, alcohol, fruity smell, hops  This beer hits you with a five finger exploding taste technique with a chocolate, creamy, smooth, roasted coffee beans, deep lingering joy joy joy joy down in my heart taste.

73,226,LeftyBWS,4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle into a Sam Adams pint glass. Label declares this brew is fresh before 3/16/08. A: Beautiful dark brown color, hinging on black. Full 2.5 inches of light brown head, bubbly but thick and slow to fall. Lovely sticky lacing. S: Deep chocolate malts, sugary and toasty. Slightly bready, but very smooth and enticing. T: Malty and smooth up front, quite chocolatey, perhaps a hint of toffee. Tiny hop presence in the midtaste? A bit grainy/earthy as well, with a taste of fruit, maybe cherries? Finish is back to the malts, slightly sweet but mostly calm and smooth. In general, the tastes are subtle, but the mixture is awesome. M: Refreshing and smooth. Kinda dryish from the chocolatey tastes, but overall quite smooth and satisfying. D: Great. I could have a few of these quite easily.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Bitterbill,4.68,"I got this in a trade with autumnaldave. Thanks Dave!  This pours from 12oz bottle(best by 2/11/08) a clear dark brown with reddish hues and a small 1 finger head of foam that recedes to a fine broken layer after some time but the good lacing lasts even longer. Very appealing to look at in my glass.  The smell is of chocolate, roasted malt, and a touch of hops.  The taste is big roasted and caramel malt and chocolate notes with a nice thick mouthfeel and light carbonation. More sips in and there's a mild infusion of hop bitterness that takes the edge off the sweetness a bit and it does a nice job of it. Wonderful bitterish aftertaste going on here. Wow. Tasty as heck but so damn smooth drinking and for me, someting I'd consider quite sessionable. I can't get over how nice the chocolate is in this Porter and how well all the flavours work together. I just found my new favourite example of the style, me thinks. This is one that certainly deserves to be sought out! Thanks again, Dave!!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,zdk9,4.55,"This was my 'conversion' beer and still probably in my top 5 favorite beers- especially for incredible flavor in an almost session beer. Tonight I toast mine to the memory of the lost ship and finally do a formal review.  A- Pours black with very dark ruby highlights. Two fingers of head (mostly my bad pour) gives way to weak spidery lacing.  S- Roasted espresso beans, unsweetened cocoa, the slightest hint of milk. After some major nose exploration the hops presence comes out somewhere between holly and rich earth.  T- Fresh taste of roasted coffee. Dark chocolate. And again a hint of milk. The back of my mouth gets some of the evergreen hops taste which matches amazingly with roasted tones. This taste is to intoxicating I have to hold myself back from taking the beer down in gulps. I really can't get enough of it.  M- Astringent and slightly thin. Is that good for sessionability? Probably so maybe I'm too harsh. But it probably would be a better beer with some milkiness in the mouthfeel.  D- I can't help but drink this one fast and wish I had more in the fridge. The perfect tasting porter in my opinion.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Gehrig,4.28,"Oddly enough, I first tried this porter about a week after a brisk discussion of the shipwreck that gave the beer its name, and maritime work generally, prompted by hearing Gordon Lightfoot's ode to the vessel. Strong in taste and bold in its flavors, this should not disappoint porter lovers.  It has a deep color that is nearly black, and poured a modest head into my pint glass. The aroma of chocolate and coffee was readily evident before tasting, more so upon consumption. I found it rich and enjoyable, but not a beer that I would have a few of in a row. Its flavors are strong, and can be balanced nicely with a clean ale before or afterward to highlight its distinct aroma and taste.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,tayner,3.15,"This poured dark brown, looked black until it was backlit... decent head that dissipated quickly.  It smelled of roasted malts and a whiff of aroma hops.  average taste at best for me. I love porters but this one, for some reason, did not wow me. I could taste bitter chocolate and some coffee hints, but nothing really stood out.  A bit watery for me. was not expecting the thickness of a stout by any means, but i wanted more in the way of mouthfeel in this brew.  As for drinkability, if someone gave me one i would certainly drink it, but for me, this one is quite forgettable with so many other wonderful choices out there. just average in my opinion. I would choose Black Butte Porter by Deschutes every single time over this one.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,tkarsies,4.35,"I picked this up while looking for something for a break from the many high ABV beers I had accumulated for cold weather. When I tried this before, I dont remember being a big fan, but well give it another shot. Anyway, has a best before date of 3/8/08. Served cool in a pint glass and allowed to warm while drinking.  Pours very dark brown, nearly black. Small tan head lasts from start to finish. Nice.  Smells of roasted maltdifferent from what I remember other porters smelling like, but I don't try them that often. Also with coffee and chocolate in the nose.  Taste is of fresh roasted coffee and chocolate. There is sweetness and bitterness allmixed together. Some hop presence that shows up but does not dominate.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with slight carbonation.  This is a very drinkable beer. The alcohol is really not noticeable. It was a nice break from the Impy stouts I have lined up. In the past, I have not really cared for portersthere is always some sourness or metallic flavor that I cant get past. This, though, was outstanding and will be a new favorite.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,dren,4.03,"Pours black with some red around the edges where the light hits it. A tan colored thick head. Leaves quite a bit of lacing.  Smells like sweet chocolate and coffee.  Tastes the same, chocolate and coffee with a slightly bitter hoppy finish. Creamy throughout. This is what a porter should be, not watery in the middle like a lot of porters I've had. This one is good! The alcohol is slightly warming, surprising for the content.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied. It's smooth and flavorful.  This is my now go-to porter. Can't go wrong with this one.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,MP72,4.67,"I recently ran out my SN porter so I bought a half of the Edmund Fitzgerald. I have to say I think it is better and I love the SN. This is an absolute must try for any porter fan.  Served in a tulip pint glass from a home kegerator  Appearance was almost pitch black with a nice light tan head and great lacing. Smell was of chocolate and some burnt coffee Taste was again chocolate and burnt coffee with no bitter aftertaste like Sierra Nevada(which I dont mind at all). Silky smooth and very tasty. Mouthfeel is creamy and light with flavor that lingers just long enough.  Drinkability is off the charts in my opinion I could easily put away several, and actually did.

73,226,ThatWineGuy,4.47,"Exp 12-26-07, purchased at Merchant's in Dearborn recently. Very dark, black with cherry edges when held in a very bright light. Initial half finger tan head wafted away leaving a ring around the glass and a few errant bubbles. There did not appear to be a lot of carbonation but there was decent lacing. The smell was very chocolately, mocha, toasted almonds, chocolate biscuit. Rich chocolate taste, malt, well balanced bitterness with a lingering, dry, dark chocolate latte finish. Not a hint of astringency. Swirling and even putting the glass down enriched the tan ring around the glass with a fresh supply of bubbles although, again, very little by way of visible carbonation. Overall, a rich taste, full flavours, a full body without being overbearing, very drinkable. This porter certainly lives up to its growing reputation as one of the best, what a treat.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Stimack,4.8,"Was able to try this one on tap last evening while as Slows. It had a nice black color with ruby and brown highlights, a nice sized dark tan head that had nice retention and left a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma was nice, a little bitter probably from heavy roasted malts? While also giving off scents of coffee, chocolate and dark malts. This is a very inviting brew, possibly the nicest aromatic porter I have had. The taste is simply fantastic, nice slight bitterness mixed with flavors that match the nose. The malt flavors here are simply incredible, they flavors that they give off play perfectly together. Slight carbonation also plays nice and the feel is medium. This is probably one of the finest beers I have ever had so incredibly easy drinking, take that with a grain of salt because Porters are my favorite brews. I have been waiting for a long time to give this a try since I have not been able to find it in NY. I was not disappointed to say the least, what a delight. Now how can I get some of these in NY.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Taste is phenomenal, roasted coffee with dark chocolate that leaves a great bitter coffee after taste in your mouth as if you just had a handful of chocolate covered coffee beans. Most impressive brew! Mouthfeel is extaordinary, smooth as silk as it warms with great drinkability. FFF Alpha Klaus: step aside Edmund Fitzgerald coming through.

73,226,mherring,4.68,"I'm just gonna start off by saying that I loved this beer! The appearance was awesome, it basically poured out a black color with an inch or so of light brown head. The smell was solid, some malty scents, maybe almost coffee like. The taste really hit the spot. Nice carmelly/maltly deliciousness. I really liked the mouthfeel; there wasn't a lot of carbonation and I was fine with that. Overall drinkability is huge on this one.

73,226,k3n,3.9,"12 oz bottle via Tangfoot  A: Pitch black with a finger of head that dies down quickly.  S: Bittersweet chocolate. Toasted malt. Smell was quite apparent when I popped the cap, but seemed more subdued in the glass. Odd.  T: All about the malts baby! Toasted malts, black coffee, bittersweet chocolate. A very slight hop astringency at the end.  M: A bit too fizzy upon sipping, and I was looking for a bit more 'heft'.  D: Nicely drinkable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Nearly no head at all on pour, drinkability is incredibly smooth, one of the best of breed.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,akorsak,4.47,"Served with a smile at Capone's.  A: The porter is nearly opaque, redeemed by some reddish dark note that emerge as light pours through the glass. The head is luxurious but does not last long.  S: The nose betrays chocolate and caramel flavors, quite dark and roasted, along with a powdery milk chocolate sweetness that I've never noticed before.  T: I had this beer after a pint of Blackstrap Stout and I found that combination to be quite alluring. My palate was reasonably beat up from the Blackstrap and I think that that allowed new flavors to emerge. The obligatory chocolate is present but there is a sweet spicy undertone that is quite evident. The flavor is cinnamon with a powdered chocolate profile, sweet but subtle enough that it does not detract from porter's body.  M: The mouthfeel is quite nice, sweet enough that it serves as a good counterpoint to the bite of the Blackstrap.  D: This is an excellent porter, no doubt about it. If you haven't tried it yet, what are you waiting for?",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ncvbc,4.22,"Pours a deep brown, near black with ruby highlights. Medium brown head which fades to a ring. More sweet scents in the nose compared to others, though it was very nice. Chocolate was up front with some light roasted coffee. Caramel also came through with some nutty undertones. Taste was much of the same. While it was a little more sweet than I preferred, it was still very interesting. More of a milk chocolate taste and again sweet caramel malt was very present. Roasted coffee still and a citric hop presence. More of a light mouthfeel and almost silky smooth aside from a little much carbonation. Still, a very drinkable brew by all means. Something about this reminds me of Anchor Porter, although I haven't had that for a while now. I wish I had more than this one to go by and I couldn't hold off on trying it...glad I did!

Formed a large, creamy, mostly lasting tan head, that left solid lacing throughout. Dense and murky with plenty of active carbonation. The smell is strong with roasted malt, grassy hops, and chocolate. At first, the taste is dominated by those burnt, smokey, roasted malts, but about midway through you get the chocolate and coffee tones, followed by the piney/citrusy hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is silky smooth, full bodied, with a creamy texture.  A top of the line American Porter. Well crafted and highly drinkable. As far as I'm concerned, the benchmark for quality for the style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,pumarocks,3.38,"OK, this is one serious brew. You don't drink this so much as you chew it ha-ha! I had this on draft at the Winking Lizard in downtown Cleveland. It is dark: more black than brown and very cola-like in appearance. It has a wonderful smoky flavor that is intense with chocolate undertones. This actually went very well with the Caribbean jerk chicken wings I ordered. I have had this in a bottle b4 but it is much better on draft.

Smell is of dark caramel malts with a fresh french roast coffee odor. Nice nutty smell with a rich dark chocolate malt in the nose as well. Taste is a light coffee like malt with a bit of a milk chocolate flavor to it. Has a bit of a hop bite to it which is balanced out well with the caramel malt flavor. Aftertaste is coffee with a bit of cream and sugar with some smokey woody notes. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a dull carbonation.

Scent- At first it was all Creamy chocolate and caramel followed by the complex roasted nutmeg and loads of citrus scented hops.  Taste- A light moca flavored coffee with a distinct roasted malt blend at the start. And a nice intense hop bitterness mixes with the caramel near the end.

73,226,latercol,3.98,"I had this on tap tonight at Schwoeglers bowling alley... Apparently nobody here has learned the fine art of pouring a beer properly. Every beer I have ever ordered here is served with zero head. I swirled this fine dark porter around in my pint glass a bit and was pleased that I got a thin creamy layer to appear and stick.  Smell is really good but fairly mild... roasted malts, dark chocolate, and fresh coffee. It was served to me ice cold, and I think if I had allowed it to warm, that more of these pleasant scents would come out. Another problem is I get strange stares when I am sniffing my beer at the bowling alley... people ask if something is wrong with my beer.  The taste of this was quite nice... somewhat dessert like. Slight sweetness and low bitterness. Lots of nice flavors. Coffee and dark Chocolate again. One of the better porters I have had.  Great feel...smooth and creamy. Loved it!  I could drink a couple of these, but bear in mind that it is a very filling beer.  This porter was overall really good. I think if it had been poured more skillfully, and allowed to warm a few degrees first, that I may bumped up the appearance and smell ratings a tad. I will order this one again when I am bowling, as it is one of the alleys best offerings.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Chocolate and coffee dominate. There is a buttery vanilla taste in the background which makes this especially nice.  M: Full bodied with a creamy feel.  D: Very drinkable porter. Wish I had saved this one for a cool winter night.  Overall: I had heard a lot about this beer so was quick to snatch it up when I saw it. It is quite possibly the best porter I have ever had.

I am a huge coffee drinker so this beer was instantly close to my heart.  -Taste: Intimidating at first and very ""big,"" but after the initial shock, the beer is wonderful. Very full bodied and rich. There is a strong taste of roasted coffee which adds to its heaviness. This beer gets better as you drink it. The initial taste may be a bit much for some, but hang in there because this is a great beer.  This beer takes some time, but if one gives it that time they will be rewarded.  Overall I give it a 4.3 out of 5. This is another great beer from Great Lakes.  *If one gets the chance, GO TO THE BREWERY.

Rich, assertive chocolate malt flavor, coffee settles in the background and lasts the duration. Hop fruitiness is complimentary and nearly reaches a citrus level. Dry, chary roasted coffee and bitter cocoa rounds out the pleasant finish. Flavors are consistent from the start. Medium mouthfeel offers a good carbonation that builds some froth.

73,226,zeff80,4.42,"A - Poured out a jet black color with a foamy/soapy, tan, two-finger head. It left nice rings of lace.  S - It smelled of chocolate and some sweet caramel.  T - It tasted of dark chocolate and roasted malts. The caramel aroma comes through in a faint caramel taste. The overall taste is like a mocha.  M - It was very sharp and crisp. A medium bodied beer.  D - This is an outstanding porter. Great chocolate taste.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Risser09,4.38,"Appearance: Dark black with brown edges that let some light through. Plenty of dark tan head leaves an equally impressive amount of lacing behind. Smell: Fragrant with malt and coffee, although it may not be a part of the brewing process. Taste: Chocolate (cacao) flavor that is raw and like a real nice dark chocolate. Toffee and touches of peanut butter are apparent. Again, this beer is nicely balanced with hops as well. It's not a one-trick pony. Sublime. Mouthfeel: Silck and creamy. the hop bite picks you up at the end and makes you drink on. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming. Drinkability: This beer is worth seeking out for porter lovers. I would drink this again if I see it on my travels.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,northernbrews,3.65,"Picked up a 12oz bottle from Merchant's in Dearborn. I've always walked by this highly rated porter...let's see if I should have picked this before now.  Appearance: This pours dark brown with slight reddish brown around the edges. The 1 inch tan head fades quickly to a thin layer on top. There is some nice lacing on my snifter.  Aroma: Starts with some roasted and slightly burnt tasting malts. Too much smoke/burnt flavor for me. This makes way too some slight coffee and dark chocolate notes. As this warms, the smokey malts become a little bit sweeter. I can see people liking this if they like smokey and heavy roast flavors...but I guess I'm not one of them.  Taste: The initial taste is sweet and roasted malts. The finish is a little bit of chocolate, but I wish this had some more flavors going on. It's pretty boring actually.  Mouthfeel: This is kind of thin, even for a porter. The smokey and roast malt flavors hang around for a bit.  Drinkability: There is too much smoke and heavy roast flavors going on with this for me to want more than one or two of these. Again, if these flavors suit your tastes, this could be a normal session beer.  Overall: I was expecting more from this beer, especially because of all the good beers I've had from Great Lakes over the years, and since this has won numerous medals. I guess there was a reason I've passed this up numerous times in the past....won't be picking this up anytime soon, but it's worth a try if you like the above flavors.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,homebrewhawk,4.3,"12oz. brown bottle, best by 12/17/07. Poured a deep opaque brown. Light carbonation. Fine bubbled brown head. Nice coffee/roasted malt aroma. Medium to full bodied. Starts off with lots of chocolate and some malt sweetness. A little hop bitterness in the middle. Fantastic long dry finish with a lingering flavor of coffee. A nice example of an American Porter.

Taste- Cafe mocha. Creamy, sugary burnt roast coffee with milk chocolate blended in. Mouthfeel- Big coffee flavor up front with a bitter chocolate bite through the middle. A dry finish full of flavor.  Overall- An easy porter to chug. Goes down too easily. 7 or 8 would make for a pleasant evening.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,seaoflament,4.62,"Thanks to Jay23 for sending this one as an extra in our trade!  This one pours a black color with a reddish tinge when held to the light. There is a slight amount of head which falls down to a thin lace around the glass.  The aromas I get out of the glass as I pour are intense with quality gourmet coffee, malt, chocolate, toffee and a subtle woodiness, from the hops my guess. This beers aroma is filling enough, almost no need to drink it as I already feel satisfied.  The taste is just as good as the aroma. Coffee seems quite present to me with a nice slightly bitter and dry finish. This would work as an excellent after dinner beer which one can relax with. Easily the best porter I have tried.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,garcia2a,4,"This beer had a wonderful chocolate malt bouquet. It poured nice and dark with a half inch head. The beer revealed a choco-malt taste with an ever fleeting smoke back taste. The beer went down smooth and nice, perfect for a porter. Mouthfeel was good.  This is a lovely drinking porter that I cannot wait to use in my porter based beef stew this fall. This will be good sleeping weather drinking.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,clickpush,2.79,"Poured 12oz bottle to pint glass. Two fingers of tan head rise over a coffee like body. Head leaves nice lace and a halo behind. Smells of coffee and caramel though somehow fairly sweet and unidemensional. Flavor is metallic and sour, finishes with a lingering bitterness that has absolutely no roast character. Lace remains on the glass very nicely as I drain it. Big disappointment as this beer flavor and texture is watery.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jpkoch1962,4.32,"Poured at cellar temps into pint glass. Ruby red bodering on opaque black -just of hint of red penetrates when held against light. Dirty brown head which forms a long lasting head when poured.  Aroma dominated by up strong up front maltiness. Choclate, toffy, and malt combine to give a very fragerant aroma. The front end comes out in strong fashion; hints of choclate, malt and burnt coffee and java smooth into a nice warm middle and slightly bitter finish. This is a very complex porter; I would like to see more hop bitterness, however. Otherwise, this is a very good porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,bozebus17,4.62,"Poured a very dark brown. There was a large caramel colored head that lasted a while but not for the duration of the pint. Lacing was everywhere.  The smell is full of sweet caramel, tofee, and roasted aromas. There should be an Edmund Fitzgeraald scented candle.  Upon my first sip I was hit with all kinds of different flavors. I am initially hit with a strong sweetness. It is followed by all kinds of roasted flavors, some chocolate, coffee, and a coffee-like bitterness. The body is slightly chewy, smooth, and creamy.  This is another amazing beer from Great Lakes Brewing Company. I am more and more convinced that this is one of the more consistant brewers out there. I have yet to be dissapointed by any of their products. This is a superb porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Halcyondays,4.08,"Stop no. 3 on my Great Lakes medley comes the EFP, a 12 oz. bottle,  A: Dark brown, with thick tan head, with some floaters, and yeasties at the bottom.  S: Roasted malts, coffee, milk chocolate.  T: Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, molasses, a bit of maple syrup and some earthy hops to hold it all together.  M: A little thin, I know this was a porter, but I was looking for a little more heft to hold it together.  D: A good session porter, a bit pricey in this neck of the woods, but a good choice if you are in an area where this stuff is readily available.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

T- On the palate the flavors consist of chocolate notes, and coffee flavor. , there is a slight after-taste but its not bitter like some porters are.  M- Feels good in your mouth, crisp.  D- Goes down very easy. In a word; SMOOTH!  I got this bottle of Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter at Capone's Restaurant out-side of Norristown, Pennsylvania.

73,226,Slar211,4.7,"12 oz. bottle from the B-Side Liquor Lounge on Coventry, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful dark brown/black into a pint glass, with a nice creamy head fading to sticky lacing on the glass.  Smell: Very complex, ranging from sweet to bitter to smoky.  Taste: Dark chocolate and roasted malt, and there's that smokiness again. Hops show up at the end to balance the taste very well.  Mouthfeel: A creamy smooth finish, like liquid velvet.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for a porter, in fact one is hardly enough.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,soupyman10,4.78,"Pours a dark brown, nearly black color with a solid tan head on top. Looks fantastic. Nose is fairly smooth roasted malt, with some light chocolate and coffee hints. Taste is incredible; coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, some spiciness, light prunes, the list just keeps on going. A really delicious beer. Body is solid and full, with good carbonation. I've had this before and amazingly, I wasn't that impressed. I remember thinking it was pretty bland for such a renowned beer. I now rescind such thoughts, because this one was outstanding. One of the best porters I've ever had, one that I'll have at every opportunity.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,cichief,4.12,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle.  A- Pours a deep brown, not quite black, with a light brown head.  S- Strong chocolate smell, sweet, inviting.

Could drink several of these over an evening.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,wagenvolks,4.27,"12 oz. bottle into a large wine glass.  A wisp of tan foam quickly disappears above a dark brown body. Crimson creeps in at the edges due to the translucency of this porter. Aroma is quite rich, full of roasted coffee beans, hazlenut, chocolate malts, and a touch of crystal hops. An overall smokiness pervades the aroma.  The taste packs some major malted chocolate notes, as well as spice, coffee, and (again) a hint of hoppiness. Nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit overly carbonated for a porter, but the medium body is crisp, surprisingly refreshing, and leaves a decent lingering coffee aftertaste. This tasty Great Lakes brew drinks easily and has complexity to boot, making it not only enjoyable, but pursuable as well.

73,226,MiScusi,4.07,"Enjoy by freshness date of 4/30/07, which puts me almost 2 months past its prime. I suspect this beer has been stored in good conditions though. Dark brown, ruby read pour with a huge frothy light tan head. The smell is rich chocolate with light roast, a tad bit of coffee towards the end. The taste is absoulutely a lot of chocolate but a bit more roast than most porters. Also in the taste is caramel sweetness. The body is farily thin with a definitely watery characteristic, I would prefer it just a touch more full. The flavor stays interesting all the way till the end and doesn't get too monotonous like I would describe the Avery Porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Medium body. Very drinkable, a very tasty porter, highly recommended.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,letsgopens,4.8,"This outstanding selection pours a dark, near black with amber highlights and a nice full tan head that holds well and leaves a good bit of lace.  In the aroma department theres some great roasted malt, coffee and sweet/bitter cocoa. Almost two separate characteristics, outstanding.  The flavor reveals more roasty sweetness, coffee, and chocolate malt. The finish has just enough delicate bitterness to round out this very well balanced porter.  Mouthfeel-wise it is creamy, smooth, and decadent. A real pleasure on the palate. As for drinkabilty; some of my friends and I took a keg of it on spring break this past semester and it is impossible to get sick of. I could eat this stuff on my cereal in the morning. Another example of why I love all things Great Lakes.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Smell is full of burned and roasted notes of chocolate and molasses, some coffee too. There is a medium maltiness which makes the beer smell sweet and full-bodied. Also some earthy hops which are quite aromatic.  Taste is burned/roasted with coffee and chocolate. The dark malts give a maltbitterness. Also some bitterness of the hops, which are earthy and mild. Great balance! Body is medium. Aftertaste is dry and roasted. Drinkability is high and mouthfeel is smooth.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,objectivemonkey,4,"Pours a solid black with mahogany hues, a decent half inch head that dissipates quickly, no so much lacing. The aroma is of coffees, cocoas, chocolates, dark malty goodness. The taste is similarly full of malts, dark, chocolates, coffee, some leafy hop and a good dose of bitterness. The mouth is medium full, good carbonation and velvety texture. In all, its a good beer, but can't quite see anything past 'good.'",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

This beer is damn tasty and so smooth for the style.  D: Overall a fantastic beer and a great testament to the style. I am in love with what GLBC is brewing.

73,226,HoppyBen,4.28,"Given to me as a gift from my BA ""sponsor"". This was my first porter and I think that I may have set the standard too high now. This particular brew was dark and inviting in color just a bit lighter/more translucent than Guiness. The head was thick and off-white in color but not so thick as to seem solid at a glance. The aroma was pleasing and inviting: hints of coffee, carmel, and the faintest bit of spruce. The flavor was VERY pleasing indeed following the suit of the aroma. It was bold but not so much that it caused you to be overwhelemed. The most notable flavors were the lightly bitter coffee taste that led to a lightly sweet finish. The mouth feel was quite fluid, relatively light, with just the right fizz. Each sip was easily followed by another and for such a flavorful brew, it went down quite smoothly. Overall, a good choice for a relaxing evening. IMHO, it was very diverse and I feel as if it would be enjoyed with food as much as by itself on a crisp autumn eve. Very nice indeed.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jspruit,4.35,"This has been a favorite of mine for quite some time but I have neglected to rate it for some reason. Drank from a bottle pucrhased as a six-pack at International Beverage in Kentwood.  Pours a dark brown with a nice large foamy head. Smells of chocolate and coffee and makes my mouth water. Taste is similar to the smell but fuller with lots of malt and some hops presence. Although it is strong and a bold beer, the finish is smooth and I could drink a couple of these in a session.  Probably my favorite porter-even though I may be biased based on its brewery location.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,brdc,4.38,"After looking for this one for quite a while, I found a six pack at the Main Street Market in Egg Harbor. It pours a beutiful pitch black brew, with an ever lasting bubbly, creamy tan head that has a very sticky lacing if you wait long enough for the head to dissipate. Toffeeish, caramel and chocolate dominate the aroma, opening way to a firm, pleasant combination of the same bittersweet chocolate, caramel, coffee and toffee taste, with a bittersweet aftertaste. Easy to drink, a very impressive porter that justifies the waiting.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,neenerzig,4.28,"Got a pint of this the other day during happy hour at the Great Lakes brewery. Served in a pint glass/tumbler. This beer is a dark brown/opaque color that does not let any light in. Has a frothy looking tan head about 2/3 inches thick when drawn from the tap. Settles to a good surface cover film layer. Decent lacing, but not great. Aromas of sweet roasted malt along with strong hints of chocolate and coffee are present, rounded out by a bit of roasted hops. Tastewise it is very similar tot he smell. Sweet upfront with strong flavors of malt, coffee and chocolate followed by a hint of spiced hops. Very good, but the balance could maybe be a little better. Has a very crisp, smooth and frothy mouthfeel. Full bodied with moderate to heavy carbonation. Quite easy to drink indeed. This beer never lets me down. Another great beer from Great Lakes!  Eric",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,scoobybrew,4.42,"This was poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The color is a very deep, dark amber. It has a tan, creamy looking head that is well retained. Roasted malt dominates the aroma with chocolate and coffee-like scents. There is a faint trace of hops in the aroma. The roasted malt is also dominant in the flavor, but the hops are very noticeable also, especially on the finish. It has a medium body with moderate carbonation.  This is an excellent American-style porter. I really like the hop flavor along with roasted grain tastes. It's quite good.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,TheSarge,3.74,"Ah, a beer named for the Edmund Fitzgerald. The most famous and mysterious shipwreck of all the Great Lakes, where all hands were lost in Lake Superior. It's good to memorialize this great vessel with such an exquisite beer.  The appearance of this brew is top notch with it's deep dark ruby body and milk chocolaty head that lasts minutes after the initial pour. Thick lacing sticks to the glass all the way through.  The aromas produced are mainly chocolaty and a bit smoky. Which is shared in its taste. There are good amounts of hops character here too.  This brew is full in body and makes a great brew to sip on a cool Ohio spring or autumn evening.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jasonjlewis,4.42,A great porter. Nice lacing and retention. Nice chocolate malt smell.  The taste is incredible.

73,226,porntipsguzzardo,4.52,"Impressive brew. Very rich smell, chocolaty, with strong overtones of roasted malt. Nearly black but not quite opaque, with a thick, tan head that lasts for a few minutes. Its taste is a treat -- creamy and rich, a definite roasted flavor. Gets better as it gets warmer, which to me is the sign of a good beer that is meant to be flavorful. The mouthfeel is fine, though slightly thinner than you might expect. Though it is tasty, having several might be slightly overwhelming, as it is so rich.  One of my favorites, so far.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,crayphish,4.4,"Wow, what a beer. This porter pours a dark brown with a nice coffee colored head. Good lacing. Smell is roasted coffee and chocolate malts. Taste is more of the same with the coffee dominating, with perhaps a touch of cherry and hops. Very nice. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, and captivating. Porters are not amongst my favorite beers, yet this brew is one the best I've had. Outstanding indeed.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

It lasted almost the entire pint.  A nice chocalate, sugary, toasted malt aroma. Very inviting. Full, thick mouthfeel that is bold and filling. Starts out smooth and silky going down, and then turns semi-bitter (burnt roasty taste) with a slight sour note at the end.

73,226,flexabull,4.08,"Pours a dark clear brown color, with a nice large off white head. Looks like a classic porter.  Aromas are slightly sweet, nutty, and malty.  Taste is dry and with nice carbonation. The core flavors are of roasted malts, and a crisp slightly bitter hop finish. This is a pretty nice porter.  Mouthfeel is a bit weaker than I like in a beer like this. It's not bad, but it doesn't quite stack up with some of my favorites in the style. It just seem a bit too lean.  Drinkability is excellent. This is a solid example of the style. Enjoyable, and very easy to drink.  Got two bottles of this, one courtesy of jasonm, the other from unclejedi.

Sweet malty caramel.and malted milk balls.  The mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium bodied; slightly understated. A small tingle from carbonation and a clean finish.  The flavor is sweet malt caramel, much like the aroma. A slight lingering coffee note ending.  Very drinkable and at 5.8% ABV seems to be a nice session beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,kajerm,4.1,"Bottle with a dark, epic-looking shot of the ship (S.S. This Beer.) Pours opaque black with a one finger cream-colored head and a little lacing.  The nose is overpowering coffee and chocolate, with an undertone of lighter malts and some hops. This beer has all the right notes for a porter, but it smells way too assertive to be one-- and that suits me just fine.  Tastes like it smells, loads of coffee flavor up front with just a little malt in the background. The finish is lingering coffee, black malt bitterness, and enough hops to balance the rest out. Espresso-like stringency from black malts and hop bitterness hangs around for a long time. Pretty good.  The mouthfeel is light and creamy, and as much as I've pissed and moaned about light palates in stouts, this one suits the flavor profile just right.  Finally, I've found a porter (other than Alpha Klaus) that can deliver some real flavor. If there are more out there like this, I might actually start to like this style. At 5.8% ABV, you could drink this through a funnel.  RERATE: Much more chocolatey than I remember it tasting last night, coffee is only really in the background in the nose, but present on the finish. This is an awesome session beer, but it's definitely a porter-- drink it in the wrong mood and you'll just be craving a Blackout Stout instead.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Nose is malty with some bits of smokey wood rising out of its depths. Flavor is quite nice. Not overly done with the smokiness but just the right amount that it holds up well without wearing out the tastebuds. Little bits of licorice candy as well. Heavy peated malts too. Medium mouthfeel that thickens as it warms. Too bad I only have one bottle of this beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Earthy.  The Porter produces a firm wood, raisin- taste leading to a creamy-bitter finish that lingers for sometime; almost a few steps away from a sherry.  A very nice change up from your AIPAs and APAs.

Smell is of ripe fruit, cocoa, chocolate infused coffee with cream, and perhaps a touch of light citrus hops.

73,226,foofight11,4.22,"The beer was in a 12oz. brown bottle with a freshness date easily viewable. I then poured the beer into a freshly cleaned 16 oz. American Pint glass from Alcatraz Brewing Company. The appearence in the glass was nice. Very dark brown, almost (merely) black, with a mocha-coffee-like color head that was the size of half my pinky. The head slow goes as one continues to drink. The smell was definitley complex. As this is my first experience reveiwing please take heed. I could definitely smell a sweet aroma as well as a rosted scent. Very complex and inviting. The first taste, a cocoa flavor jumped through immediately followed by a hint of frutiness. A breadth of flavor on the first try. The mouth feel was very filling. The carbonation stayed all the way through and down. Definitely a drinkable beer. I see it as almost like a dessert beer. Respectfully worth having one or two.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Tastes of smooth coffee, some cocao and black fruits and berrries. Malt is mixed with a sourness of green apple, some caramel too. Feels light and smooth. Sourness puckers the mouth a bit but contrasts greatly with the roast.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,mikesgroove,4.05,"Poured a deep dark brown with a nice reddish ruby tint to it. Nearly opaque but enough light came through to show off the red tones to it. Hige pillow like cream colored head was very slow to recede and when it did left behind a large amount of gooey lace on the glass. The smell was very strong of roasted dark chocolate, which caught me a bit by suprise. As it warmed some more sugary, caramel like tones started to come through. The mouthfeel was a little thin, watery which is my only complaint, I expected a bit more of a robust feel to it. The taste itself was very nice. Suprisingly hoppy on the back and very well balanced with the roasted malts. Main flavors here were more of a roasted coffee and sugar, with a ever so slight hint of chocolate, nothing like the smell which was dominated by it. Overall this was a nice sessionable beer. At 5.8%abv very drinkable and very smooth.

I'm picking up some mild cherry and licorice. It also has the smoked flavor I smelled. This is a very good beer.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is an extremely smooth porter.

73,226,jmalex,4.2,"Split a sixer of this with 3 friends. I just can't get enough of porters.  APPEARANCE: Freshness date of 7-30-07. A dark, dark brown that is only very slightly transparent when held up to light. The head is small despite a turbid pour. It disappears very quickly leaving a thin collar and splotchy patches across the top of the beer. As I approach the end of the glass, all traces of the head are completely gone.  SMELL: The smell is very roasted - almost stout-like. Chocolate, licorice, dark fruits, and coffee are all present in the aroma. Quite nice.  TASTE: The roasted flavors hit you instantly along with caramel and chocolate. The malts then change to bitter black malt. Very nice! The finish goes back to roasted coffee with maybe a hint of a funky sourness. Not bad though.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium bodied - a little thinner than I would've expected. The carbonation is fine though.  DRINKABILITY: The beer definitely goes down easy and would absolutely be sessionable. Mine is almost gone as I type this. A solid choice.  I have to say, I was expecting a little more here. I couldn't pick out anything special. This beer is basically a thin roasty porter with a slightly off flavor. Every beer deserves a second chance, though, so I'm lucky I have another in my fridge.  EDIT 4-9-07: I had to revisit this. After having it on draft, I loved it, but I'm still underwhelmed a bit after having it from the bottle. My scores for appearance and taste went up a bit, but I really can't get a handle on this one.  EDIT 10-30-07: The head starts out great and still maintains a hearty collar throughout. The smell is fantastic with much more of a chocolate and black malt flavor coming through. I'll leave the taste where it is, though I was REALLY close to bumping it up. My notes above are pretty close to what I'm getting tonight. The mouthfeel still feels a bit thin, but it's really not too bad. All in all, I really suspected I had some bad bottles before, and I think this confirms it. Thankfully I was able to have this on tap and knew not to give up on it. I'll be looking for more.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Pour creates a faily tight, 1/2"" tan head which disappointingly fades quickly to a thin web-like wisp. Pleasant, but quite restrained aromas of bakers chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, dried dark fruit and coffee beans. Found the palate to be leaning toward the thin side; just a tad watery. Flavor shows off a bit more intensity than the aroma did with semi-sweet rich notes of dark chocolate, French roast coffee, roasted malts and burnt caramel candy. Some faint hop flavors sneak in to invoke some slight bitterness to tame the sweetness. Overall a bit tame but very well balanced.

A - Pours a dark brown..almost a mahogany...with a large caramel-brown head; long retention with sticky lacing on the glass.  S - Excellent aroma that developed over time. After the pour, it emitted a nutty chocolate scent, that was very good in and of itself. As the beer warmed, the cocoa faded into the background, making way for a very smokey aroma...almost like from a smokehouse - personally, I love the smoked-meat aroma that I've only found in a handful of brews. After an hour of sitting in my glass, a wonderful tapestry of roasted nuts, bold coffee, and smokehouse flavors filled the air.  T - Roasted coffee with dark chocolate leads the way, with some nuttiness in the background. As it warmed, more of a pronounced wood flavor arose. Finishes very strong with chocolate, coffee, and mild vanilla in the aftertaste. No excessive alcohol to throw off the flavors either, so they were much more appreciated.  M - Wonderfully creamy body that seemed to get even creamier and richer as the beer warmed. This brew is definitely one that you need to let sit for about an hour to fully appreciate its complexities.  D - Excellent selection - I very much wish that I had another.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

This bottle has a freshness date of 3 months ahead.  Aroma is of roasted malt with some hops showing through. Taste is roasty just how I like a porter to be, with a nice subtle bitter hop finish. There is a creaminess to this one that is out of this world.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Simply a pleasure to roll over the tongue down the throat.

Poured a dark mahogany with caramel-colored highlights and a bubbly, light beige, one-finger head that slowly faded to a thick ring. Some spotty streaks of lacing cascaded down the sides of the glass.  Aroma was sweet and rich and consisted of strong notes of dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malts, along with hints of brown sugar, maple syrup and a general woodiness.  Taste was a mix of deep, dark flavors. Roasted malts, bitter espresso and a distinct nutty flavor came through strong along with sweet malts and some creaminess. A touch hoppy on the back end with a remarkably clean, dry finish. Well balanced. Initially, I did not detect any aftertaste, but later some pleasant, subtle coffee notes became apparent.

Taste starts immediately with roasted grain and then becomes more creamy with some plum pudding flavors. Very dry as a porter should be, slightly winey finish, delicious. The mouthfeel is smooth and has a little creaminess to it, but is just a tad lighter than I'd like. Very dry, a quite carbonated. Quite drinkable- nice flavor, smooth, and balanced creaminess.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Phatz,4.71,"Thanks to Akorsak for hooking me up with this beer. This is an excellent Porter! I love it! Then again, I am a huge fan of the Porter style. Served in a pint glass starting near room temp. I highly recommend letting Porters in general (this one included) warm up when you pull them from the fridge.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful opaque and almost black with slight hints of chocolate, a nice light brown head with decent retention and noteworthy lacing.  Smell: Immediately the smell of perfectly roasted malts and chocolate fill the nose, there is also a hint of espresso and a dark deep sweetness (cherry-like). Extremely enticing.  Taste: Can you get any better than exceptional! It is the prefect degree of roasted without being burnt and the perfect degree of sweet yet dry with a perfect, slightly coffee bitter that balances this masterpiece to near perfection. The layers of flavor is deep. The toasted malts, the fruit and the toffee, caramel, and the molasses and on and on. The finish was a very pleasant sweet twangy dry! I'm flabbergasted!  Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Rich and full! Creamy. It has a slight thin spot in the middle but then it is revealingly light in the stomach. Making this one hell of drinkable Porter. I highly recommend. I am going to seek out a case of this next. I love sessionable porters!!!  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jopl,4.72,"12 oz bottled with freshness date of Feb 2007 poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours black but is actually very dark red when held into the light. Starts with a finger of brown foam that dissipates into a nice ring around the top. Heavy lacing all around the sides of the glass that sticks throughout the beer.  Smell: First initial smell of roasted malts followed by rich chocolate and coffee. Makes me want to smell the beer almost as much as drink it.  Taste: Very similar to the smell. Tastes of roasted malts alongside of chocolate and coffee. The coffee taste lasts longer and lingers after you finish.  Mouthfeel: Well carbonated, smooth and creamy with a slightly bitter aftertaste that leaves you wanting more.  Drinkability: I honestly drank 3/4 of this while writing the review before realizing how much I have drank. It goes down very smooth and makes me want to have quite a few though it is a filling beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,schusterbauer,4.32,"pours jet black with a small head that disappears rather quickly, leaving a hint of lacing. very strong roasted scent, with hints of chocolate and nut. taste is very strong in the roasted/smoked flavors, with some chocolate and yeast, maybe even some oats. very big and chewy in the mouth, with flavors lingering for a long time. i love this porter, but i do have to say that after drinking a few it can become over powering -- definitely not as sessionable as a lot of porters tend to be.  this is an excellent beer that very much blurs the line between porter and stout. highly recommended, and a fridge staple.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,msubulldog25,4.35,"A 12 oz. bottle received in trade from the Maak't G of PA, melbatoast93. Thank you kindly, Hart. The classy black label shows the ship 'Edmund Fitzgerald' prior to its sinking in 1975 on Lake Superior. Best by: 'Feb. 2007'.  A: Dark brown with amber highlights and a 1/2 finger of tan head, fading to a minimal ring of the same. Splotchy bits of sticking lace.  S: Ample roasted malts, coffee, milk chocolate and a fruity sweetness. Sugar, wood and tobacco linger.  T: Robust roasted chocolate malt (almost fudge-like) with espresso-coffee bean undertones. Notes of caramel, smoked wood and peat with sweet, chocolate-covered raisins. Very tasty...  M: A tingly and slightly spiced effervescent mouthfeel. Albeit velvety smooth at times, it has some active bittersweetness in its full body. A real treat.  D: As excellent as its reputation, a highly drinkable and savory porter. Nice balance with bold, likable flavors. I would love to have this often and strongly recommend it to others.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Melchizedek,4.15,"Pours a lovely dark brown, pretty opaque except in bits around the edges. A lovely creamy tan head holds form very nicely, and shows signs of stickiness.  Smell is as rich as any imperial stout I've had, full of caramel and roasted grain, some toffee; mouthfeel is smooth and very, very pleasing and displays the same profile, with perhaps a touch even of dark fruit (fig?). Finish recedes into a light bittersweetness that beckons me back to the glass.  Oh yes. I'll have another, please...",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,doppelmeup,4.85,"Many thanks to jdoolin for sending me this very fine brew!!  Pours a rich mahogany color into a pint glass. As I hold the glass to the light, beautiful ruby highlights ring the glass. A creamy head develops and leaves a thick, lasting layer of off-white foam floating on top.  Aromas of cocoa, freshly ground coffee, fruity and malty. Slightly reminiscent of graham crackers.  Taste is exceptional, and definitely lives up to the reputation. Slightly sweet, with milk chocolate and cappucino dominating. Again, I am tasting some graham cracker maltiness and a slightly sour flavor as well, which balances the sweetness. And I almost forgot the hops hiding in the background which lend a fruity crispness to the beer.  Mouthfeel is rich, creamy and has a nice, drying finish. Coffee flavors linger ever so slightly, encouraging you to have another sip. Flavors of dark chocolate remain in the mouth while you ponder how good this beer is.  Highly drinkable. Goes down very easy, ABV is moderate, making this beer one that you could easily have several in a sitting.  Overall an exceptional brew!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,SMark,4.25,"Poured a deep dark brown with an ample head at 48 degrees. Nice sustained Brussels lace when head went south after 2 minutes. Looked very appealing.  Nice balance of malt, hops, and yeast with malt prevailing over hops but hops were lingering in the background.  Very smooth with hints of mocha chocolate and not the hops anticipated. Well balanced for a smooth malt taste.  Very pleasant without any hint of bitterness but lacked slightly in staying power.  Need to have this one with friends to see if I may be missing some of the nuances. Could probably rate higher.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,irishmoss,4.5,"Served at the Brewery on 11/10/06 to mark the anniversary of the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald. '29' refers to the number of crew members' lives that were claimed on that day back in 1975. Brewed with cherries and cranberries.  A beautiful dark brown, almost black, body with great dark tan/medium brown head. A decent head dissipated till a fat ring remained around the edges of the glass, this ring left some light lacing in clingy patches down the sides. The aroma was sweet roasted malt with chocolate covered cherries. The taste was similar to regular Edmund Fitzgerald, but with a more pronounced chocolate flavor that intertwines with cherries followed by a slight tartness from the cranberries. There are many different flavors going on this glass, but the overall experience isn't lost on just one pronounced flavor. All the flavors blend together well. Smooth medium bodied mouthfeel and good drinkability due to the fact that the cherry and cranberry flavors are nice and subtle.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,MrVisegrips,3.92,"The pour is a a dark almost black ruby red with a noble tan head. Aroma is very elegant with roasted malts and chocolate. Flavors are VERY well balanced with deep malt presence with a nice bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth leaving it very drinkable.

73,226,froggyfrog,4.85,"12 oz. bottle with a soy-ink label marked fresh through July 23, 2006. Beer enjoyed from a standard pint glass November 7, 2006.  I was expecting this to be a good Porter, but it isn't. It is a great Porter!  For appearance we've got a slenderly translucent extra-dark chocolate shell confining a carousel of ruby red light. On top sits a worthy head of toffee-colored bubble foam.  The fragrance is that of bittersweet chocolate and dark oily coffee beans. There is a heavenly sweet/floral aroma like that of caramel-dipped roses.  The floral sweetness continues in the flavor arena as dark roast and caramelized sugar struggle with a massive punch of floral hops for dominance.  This beer is a beautiful thing. It has the perfect Porter base of just slightly thin flavor-packed roastiness expertly complimented by the very intense flavor (but not bitterness) of the deftly chosen hops.  Thank you Great Lakes BC for making my night. And special thanks to robertdoesbeer for slipping me this bottle.  GLBC's website lists 12 medals won by this beer. It deserves every one.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,pmcadamis,4.5,Burgundy-black brew with a 1/2 finger head of brown foam that quickly recedes to a fizzy collar that exhibits wet spotty lacing. A good swirl readily brings back a thin brown cap.  Smells deeply malted with chocolate and coffee roast notes predominating. Sweet but bitter at the same time.  Big roasty chicory flavor at first sip. Gradual progression through sweet chocolate candy in the middle and then back to bitter coffee and chicory a the end. Hops are pretty firm and powerful for a porter. Great balance of bitter roasted grains (chicory and coffee) and bitter hops (grassy and oily)....while still remaining sweet enough to counterweight all the bitterness.  Medium bodied and nicely carbonated with a dry grainy finish. Excellent drinkability...maybe one of the most quaffable porters I've tried.  Bottom line: A damn fine porter.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Jettanbass9,4.85,"This beer is amazing... i went to a brew fest at Penn State University and tried it for the first time. I went back to their stand 4 times to get more. Absolutely my favorite porter ever. EVER. Only problem is, the only place they distribute in PA is in Pittsburgh... a long trip for philadelphians like myself. But anyway, about the beer, excellent coffee and chocolate flavors... not a thick porter, it kinda had a light mouthfeel. Just like one of the other reviewers wrote, i could drink this beer everyday.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Grundle20,3.95,"Appearance: Pours thick and black in color. There is a small amount of head with mild retention but there is some good lacing.  Smell: Rich chocolate notes set this thing off. There is a mild vanilla flare in the background.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The chocolate carries through in full force. This beer is rich with both flavor and mouthfeel. The thick flavor slurry rolls over your tongue with all out brownie chocolate tastes. There is a mild nutty vanilla finish which is surprisingly clean for a porter. Very tasty.  Drinkability: It's a little to dark for full on drinkability. I could see a couple of these at the end of the day or paired with food, not a Friday night beer.  Bottom Line: A solid porter. Another great bear from GLBC. If you like porter I wouldn't pass this up.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Callenak,4.73,"Served on tap at the GLBC.  What can I say, this is my favorite porter. One of my favorite beers and unfortunately not distributed to California. I have to ship myself a case every time I go out to Cleveland. This is the benchmark for porters, IMHO.  Pours deep black with a nice, thick head that lingers around for a while.  Smell is roasted coffee and chocolate.  Beer is all taste. Chocolate and roasted malt. A little creaminess to it with no real alcohol flavors.  I could drink this beer every day. Perfect session beer, under 6%. Full of flavor. What else do you want?",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

It pours a nearly opaque black, with a glimmer of mahogany near the bottom of the pint. The head is tan and creamy, and gathers in a thick cap that extends above the lip of the glass, the lace is thick and coats nearly the entirety of the glass.  The aroma consists mainly of coffee and roasted malt, with a little cocoa and charred wood. The flavor follows the smell, but with many additional elements: molassas, vanilla, hops, butterscotch, and slight hints of dark fruit.  The mouth is full and complex, moving from a light, creamy wave capped by sweetness, to a bittersweet, semi-dry coffee/chocolate finish. It's an extremely well-rouned and drinkable stout, yet still offers pleny of flavor.

Poured dark brown with mahogony highlights, with a small creamy somewhat lasting head with small lacing.  Smelt of moderate burnt grain, nuttiness, dark chocolate, with some light coffee.  Taste was upfront moderate coffee and dark chocolate bittersweetness, with some light nuttiness, followed by a strong burnt bitterness and nuttiness, more like nut skins, with some light sweet molasses and light bitter grassy hops accent on a mostly hoppy long grassy/green veggie finish. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied, oily, lively carbonated, with heavy astringency.  Overall, kind of an average porter, with an interesting complexity and boldness, but does little to please the palate. Nicely light bodied as well, so I could drink in the summer too.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,plaid75,4.5,Poured a deep brown hue with a one finger off white creamy head. There was very good retention and lacing.  The smell featured a bold burnt grain aroma with strong element of coffee and mild caramel.  The taste was robust and heavy. An excellent dark grain bill and mild coffee bitterness.

So I pored it into a pint glass and what a nice thick frothy head and how it maintained itself and left little lacy rings on the side of the glass marking the volume of each sip.  The Smell is what gets you first with EFP!.. a very nice spicy, robust odor that speaks well of the taste to follow.  The Taste is true porter... creamy and just the right amount of hoppiness.

Some hints of red when held up to light, but for the most part this beer is very dark.  Smell: Coffee, chocolate, and, when warm and straight out of the bottle, caramel. The caramel seems to disappear, however.  Taste: Again, the coffee and chocolate notes come out, but despite the smell of caramel I was unable to taste it in the beer. Maybe this comes out if the beer is colder? I tend to drink porters when they're a bit warmer. A nice bitterness complements these flavors.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is very good, and very substantial.

Additional black molasses sweetness with some malty qualities. A chocolate and vanilla finish on the nose with a constant reminder of the powerful, dark-roasted barley.  Like the aromas, a huge rush of deeply roasted to almost burned barley flavors lead this porter. Dark chocolates and strong charcoal with tobacco flavor really power this out. Notes of roasted walnuts, vanilla and faint black licorice. A subtle hint of dry hops before a long, deep finish similar to a French or Italian roast coffee.  Mouthfeel is creamy but not quite as viscous as typical porters. It is still thick enough to leave a nice coating on the tongue after each sip.

Taste - Sweet chocolate and rich coffee upfront, with a nice deep dark roasted malt background. Roasty burnt bitter dry aftertaste that leaves a delightful taste and feel on the tongue. An exceptional use of bittering hops to even out the sweetness without overpowering the palate. Yummy.  Mouthfeel is just about perfect.

Full rush of nutty, toasted malt accompanied by a easy to drink mouthfeel and a balanced, mature finish. This one improves as it warms as well.

73,226,jwm232,4.18,"Appearance - Dark, dark caramel color; not dark as night but pretty dark. nice, lingering head...lacing to the glass before I started drinking. Thick but not too-thick. Very nice lacing through the whole pint!  Smell - Strong bitter chocolate smell.  Taste - chocolate, coffee, matly at first...hops make a showing at the end. Leaves a hoppy lingering on my tongue. Way more hoppy than I remember. Slight metallic taste. Though it's a shade shy of 6% ABV, there is a slight boozey taste towards the end.  Mouthfeel - Nice, smooth, not uber-creamy. Carbonation not overwhelming.  Drinkability - Oh yeah!  I tried this beer at a Brew Expo...it was much better there...I think it was from a keg. I tasted a bit of vanilla at the expo and it was lacking here. Word to the wise: definitely let this brew warm-up. It rapidly changes character with a little warmth (true of lots of beers I reckon). Though I was slightly disappointed, this is one good brew.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,beveritt,4.35,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a wide-mouth pint glass. There is a freshness date on the bottle, but I can't make it out. Maybe 04/06? That would mean I am 4 months behind on this bottle.  Appearance: Pours with a medium head. Maybe two fingers of not too creamy, big bubble type stuff. The beer itself is a nice dark, red-brown. I can just barely see through it while holding it up to a 60 watt bulb.  Smell: Smells strongly of dark, rich malts. It has that coffee, chocolate, and caramel smell I like so much in the darker beers.  Taste: Yum. The taste comes across like the smell. Coffe and dark roasted malts. You can definitely pick out bittersweet chocolate flavors.  Mouthfeel: Nice lingering bitterness.  Drinkability: This is a great porter. If this is what it tastes four months past the recommended drink by date, I can't wait to pick up some more.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jhollick,4.49,"Appearance: Nearly opaque with a 1.5"" tan head that stuck around for most of the beer; deep ruby undertones.  Smell: Chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, caramel. An overall sweet and inviting aroma.  Mouthfeel: Thick, heavy, and creamy; just as I would expect from a superior porter.  Taste: A sweet and roasted flavor initally, followed by a nice, but not too sharp hop bite. The flavor then mellows, sweetens again, and then takes on a more roasted and nutty flavor. Some darker berries also come out towards the end, and dark chocoloate flavors, nuts, and caramel and present throughout the beer. There is also a slightly dry and powdery quality in the chocolate flavor. The hop bite keeps you wanting more, but it isn't enough to overwhelm by any means.  Drinkability: Par for the course for a porter. This porter is much better than most, but I'm still not going to guzzle it all night long.  Overall: Hands down the best porter I have ever encountered. The flavors are all in perfect harmony, and it is dangerously sessionable. If you can find a tastier porter, please tell me what it is and where to get it immediately.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,kimcgolf,3.74,"Poured to a dark, opaque brown with thick tan head and great lacing. malty aroma of nuts, chocolate and toffee. The taste was more of the chocolate and toffee. Body was a tad on the thin side, but finish very smooth. Although I had this on a warm summers eve, it was a most enjoyable beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,IntriqKen,4.65,"Thanks to blitheringidiot for giving me the opportunity to try this wonderful brew. Pours a deep, deep reddish amber that is almost black with a nice full head of tan bubbles that melts rather slowly to a top covering sticky lacing. Aroma is nutty coffee with cream...not bitter or biting at all. Taste is roasted coffee with a touch of caramel, a little nuttiness (as in nuts, not as in crazy), followed by a pleasant hop bite that keeps it dry and not cloying or sweet at all. Mouthfeel is almost chewy...rich and full. Aftertaste of roasted coffee bean that lasts a long, long time. This is a wonderful porter to be savored and enjoyed slowly during the course of the evening. Very drinkable and comforting.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,rabsten,5,"Poured into a pint glass from 12oz bottle (opened up with my new Beer Advocate opener! ), it presents with a three finger, lighter-brown head. Body is a dark red-tinted ebony, while the head has good lacing.  Smell: Toasted cocoa malt with metallic hop tang in the background. Coffee notes as well. Toasty all around.  Taste: This is everything I want in this style: toasted chocolate and coffee malts, some caramel-like sweetness, balanced with a subtle hop bite that keeps the malt from being too clingy. My favorite Porter.  Remarkably dry mouthfeel, especially considering all of the candy-like qualities in the flavor. Crisp enough to leave the palate mostly cleansed, with only a lingering cocoa/toasted malt flavor on the roof of the mouth. Excellent-to-spectacular.  As drinkable as a porter gets. I can  and have  have one after the other.  Ive said it before: EFP is my favorite porter. And since porter is one of my favorite styles (DIPA and IPA being the other), this is one of my favorite beers. Add to the mix that this is AVAILABLE and reasonably distributed in West Virginia (Ive heard rumors of Keg Availability, even!) and Im in heaven with this brew. I try to keep my consuption seasonal so as to not get all burned out on it. Becasue of this, this was teh first one I'd had in several months. Come September, I won't be without at least a six around.  The way I see it, Im allowed one Five out of Five per style and still maintain some credibility For Porter, Edmond Fitzgerald is my Five.  God bless Great Lakes for this beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,wcudwight,4.59,Pours a dark brown with a little light shining through. Massive frothy head that is chocolate colored with some cherry coloring to boot. Heavy lacing sticks to the sides of the glass. Truely this is something to sit and stare at. Aroma is kind of a nutty chocolate. Heavy roasted flavors. Coffee. Awsome bittersweet finish that lingers. This is the best finish I ever remember having in a beer. The flavor flows wonderfully from sweet to bitter. No harshness here. Feels wonderful in the mouth. Thick and chewy but not so much that it's a meal in a bottle. Very drinkable. I'm having to show restraint to drink it slow and enjoy the flavors. Easily the best porter I've had and one of the best beers period. Many thanks to justcas and July Secret Santa BIF 2006...My tastebuds are bowing in your honor.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Vancer,4.25,"Well, quite a brew, even if it didnt meet my expectations (darn those top 100 BA brews!)  Deep brown pour with ruby edges and a tan head, nice sheet lacing all the way down the glass. Nice label too, and with a best by dating included.  Wow, this one smells like a chocolate vanilla ice cream shake. Quaff was just a smidgen disappointing. Sure, had the coffee, chocolate and maltly start. But the finish, a lite hoppy offering was a tad thin on the sour ale taste  Im sure nit picking here.  Full bodied and dry, all it all it was very tasty and Im looking forward to the rest of the six pack and many more down the road.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Enola,4.23,I was looking forward to trying this beer and it was worth the wait. It poured a very deep brown and had a tan head. The smell is roasted grain. The taste is borderline stout. This is a hard hitting porter. Oatmeal flavors are present. This is a smooth beer . A nice roasted aftertaste. The drinkability is high. I just wish this beer was available in NC. This is a damn fine beer.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,badbeer,4.54,"Poured very dark brown, almost black with a tan head that receded to a ring around the glass. Rich smell of cherries, cocoa, some espresso notes, molasses, and currants. Amazing smell, especially for a regular porter. Roast coffee upfront, before leading into cocoa and some hoppiness, then some of the dark fruit comes through before a dry coffee finish. Medium carbonation and light to medium bodied, pretty slick and oily on the tongue. Really a joy to drink, I wish this was easier to get here in Iowa.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,expatsteve,4.06,"Appearance: Black, with a 1/2 inch cappucino head that subsides to a nice suds cover. Low medium viscosity, with thick lacing on the sides of the glass.  Aroma: Deep chocolate malts with a few hints of honey. Cool and refreshing.  Taste: Chocolate and espresso notes, with dark sweet front and middle palates. Mild milk notes and a biscuity finish. Nice balance between sweet malts and a slight astringent aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, with a malt emphasis. Fantastic.  Drinkability: A solid porter, that remains sessionable despite a nice depth of flavor. Not terribly complex, but graceful in its simplicity.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,DaveFL1976,3.95,"My first Edmund Fitzgerald.  I just got back from Belgium, and poured it into my Trappist Westveletren glass. Why not? Everything looks prettier in this thing. I'm going to drink iced tea out of it. Ok, maybe not.  Anyways, nice, deep brown/chocolate body with a bit of mahogany-red light shining through the bottom. The head starts out tan, frothy and chunky, but settles down to a skim in a couple minutes. Nice lacing, though.  Smell is dry, roasty, baker's chocolate and roasted barley. I like a sweeter smelling port usually, but it's nice.  Taste is huge on the chocolate malt with a dry finish. A bit sweet up front, but then settling into the roasted malt at the end. Pretty nice. A big porter, that's for sure.  Mouthfeel is really nice. Creamy, with those tiny little bubbles that tickle your tongue.  Drinkability is good, but it's hindered for me by the dry and roasty barley at the end.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,xzqrut,4.32,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, this Porter has a dark and rich color, more along the lines of high potency cocoa, then say coffee. The beer gives a foamy tan head, that is not too thick. The Edmund Fitzgerald has a very mild odor, but what it lacks to the nose, it makes up for in the mouth. It has a very smooth drinkability, that fills the mouth with bitter coffee tastes and complimentary tones of sweet chocolate. This porter goes down smooth, and is a great member of the Great Lakes family.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,wingman14,4.42,"Pours a dark black with a red tint when held up to a lamp, and a light tan head. Smells burnt with some smoky tones and chocolate and coffee hints. Other sweet notes come through. The taste is powered by a smoky feel and plenty of sweet notes for some balance. It has a bitter beginning with a long smoky aftertaste. Good mouthfeel, the heavy smoke flavor doesn't mask the other tones that fill this beer. This is a great beer, my favorite from great lakes. Enjoy!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

S: Aromas of coffee and caramel dominate the nose--a bit of toffee in there also. Roasted malt notes peak out too. T/M: Roasted coffee and chocolate malts wash across the mouth. Good secondary flavors of caramel and toffee malts. Very creamy and smooth through the mouth with a decent bitterness. Almost tastes like a milk stout to me, though it has a robust body and well balanced. Mellows out as it warms. Bitterness gets more pronounced as it warms too.

Aroma of light coffee and roasted malt is less dominating then expected. Taste is also dominated by light coffee with some medium bitterness form the roasted malt.

Coffee, bourbon, chocolate pudding, bit of oak.  T: Begins with a bit of slightly sour milk then transitions to a medium burnt coffee flavor. Almost a charred quality with burnt aspects, but very subtle. Ends with a touch of burnt butter. The flavors are all very subtle...  M: Bit thinner than I would have thought, but as the beer opens so does the body.  D: Not as complex as I had hoped. For the reviews, I expected more. Much better porters out there IMO.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,TurdFurgison,4.03,"I had this on tap at Slows BBQ in Detroit. The beer was dark brown with a thick tan head (lasted forever). The aroma was mostly chocolate, with a little burnt malt.  The flavor was chocolatey and malty, with a really creamy texture. This might be the best porter I've tried yet, almost stout-like. It was pretty rich with chocolate flavor.  Nice porter from Ohio, completely recommended.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Erdinger2003,3.06,"The color is black and deep purple when held up to the light. The pour was very aggressive and left lacing as is fell and stuck to the side of the glass. The head itself was a little thin after falling.  Smell is light and flowery and has a slight dark coffee smell that isn't very strong.  Taste is very strong with toffee and the dark roasted malts are very sour coffee malts. The body is a light medium body that finishes clean.  The mouthfeel is O.K., doesn't suck, doesn't rule. Well carbonated and finishes clean...not my favorite characteristic for a porter.

The aroma is mostly chocolatey, with some roasted malt and hops in there too. It tastes like semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, and hops. It has a nice bitter aftertaste too. It has a good medium mouthfeel to it, with just the right amount of carbonation. It finishes great, and it's very easy to drink.

Aroma is a slightly grape fruity and roasty malt notes. Some classic red ale aspects pop out as well.  First swigs: Baker's chocolate initially and a side track to a fruity pancake and grape aspect. Middle sugests some caramel and black coffee. Aftertaste is a touch of vanilla but not too much so.  Feel is just medium bodied with a clean finish which adds to the drinkability.

A solid inch thick tan head formed on the pour, reduced to a foam cap that holds on nicely. Lacing clings randomly about my pint glass.  Dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and a bit of sweetness prevail in the aroma. A touch of floral hops come through as well.  Taste is loaded with flavors, this is not your one-dimensional typical porter, this one has some actual complexity. Taste is initially a tiny bit sweet but then some of the carbonation comes in and strips that away, the transition after that is of chocolate and mild coffee. Finish is a bit of bitterness. Nicely done overall.  Good medium mouthfeel, typical to style. Fair amount of carbonation makes it light on the tongue, but this one still coats the mouth well. Drinkability is really good. This one is too easy to put back with its complex flavor and crisp, medium bodied mouthfeel.

Always been one of my favorite porters. Rich coffee and dark malts dominate this one with the perfect dose of bitter hops. Everything in this beer works perfectly. The harmony of the coffee, malt, and hops is incredible. Creamy and smooth as butta, this one goes down easy as pie.  Perfect amount of carbonation for this medium bodied beer.

Starts with the rawness of a porter, big bitter roasted malt. Moves then into really smooth mocha coffee middle, ending on a dry, flowery hop.

Tasted is of roasted malts, coffee with a little bit of sweetness peaking through at the finish. Good stuff. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and the finish is a little odd tasting.

The smell was very good, with hints of coffee and chocolate, and noticable sweet and dark fruits, namely raspberry and cherry. Reminded me of a flavored coffee. Sweet malts, alcohol, and possibly banana as it warmed. Really improved with temperature. Taste was dark and bitter chocolate, coffee, brown sugar. Alcohol, smoke, wood, sour cherries, sweet malts. It was decently complex and very tasty. The the mouthfeel. So close to living up to my expectations! But alas...It was bitter and dry up front, but very watery. It left a chalky, acrid aftertaste, somewhat pleasant but could ahve been moreso had there been some substance to this. Not very impressed in this department.

Aroma - but before we drink , we smell...chocolate, hearty dark bread, toffee, caramel, hint of lemon.  Taste - as promised by aroma - rich chocolate, dark bread. Smokiness from roast of malts adds richness and depth, and not not any burnt acridness at all. Caramel in the middle, and tea with lemon finishing. Some pleasantly mild smokiness in the aftertaste.

So rich and creamy that the the flavors just soak in with each sip...excellent. Medium-bodied and very easy to drink for as rich and flavorful as it is.

Some roasted notes in there as well as some slight almond and sweet bread. The reall winners are the coffee and chocolate. A brew you could smell all night! T: A delicious, smooth concoction that is driven by the coffee and bitter chocolate flavors that adorn the nose moments earlier. Neither of which is overdone as in some brews of the style. A nice hop balance that provides a slightly bitter pineyness to the tongue as to make the brew not too sweet. Chewy flavors of roasted almond and slight bread in there too.

I tasted malts, a roasted/burnt taste of coffee beans, and some nut flavors, along with a spicey flavor, maybe nutmeg. Body seems thin, carbonation not as impressive as it looks.But overall a well crafted porter. I could drink a few of these.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jdmorgan,4.47,"This outstanding porter pours a dark brownish/black, yet remains fairly clear. The head is small and creamy and dissipates quickly. The smell has a dark and full-bodied aroma of chocolate malt. The taste is similar with a bold taste and a creamy roasted aftertaste. The hop bitterness is medium and isn't too overpowering. This beer has a very well balanced taste and was quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel was medium/thick with medium/low carbonation. In summary, this was an excellent and hearty beer that is very drinkable and has taken it's place as one of my favorite dark beers.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Smells of sweet choclate and fresh coffee eminate from the goblet enticing the senses.  Very bold mouthfeel. Dark choclate roasted malt. Good hop profile with a sharp coffee bite on the finish. Big and masculine porter. Very defined and smooth. Slightly over carbonated.  An easily drinkable smooth porter that everyone seems to recommend including me.

73,226,Zorro,4.13,"12 Oz Bottle sampled through the efforts of justcas and BIF across America.  Pours a clear dark brown beer with a good light brown colored head.  Smell is roasted coffee and light citrus hops. Fainter scent of chocolate and some brown sugar.  Taste is dark roasted coffee at the start. Clean coffee and a faint trace acid from the roasted malt used. And that is about it for flavor development a porter, just a flawless one.  Mouthfeel is good.  Nice user friendly porter here at a low alcohol level too. Flawless porter that is very coffee like. It is good but not my favorite beer style. An excellent example of the style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Sugary notes meld with chocolate with a whiff of sweet bread in the nose.  Full bodied with a round malty center, the bitter roasty tastes of this beer are well balanced by sweet caramel tinges and a spicy hop finish. Chocolate and coffee flavors intensify as the beer warms.  I'm not sure why it's taken me so long to write a review for Edmund Fitzgerald - probably because I don't have a hard time remembering how good it is.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Strong aromas of dark chocolate, cold dark roast coffee, and the slightest suggestion of earthy hops at the tail end. More chocolate and dark roast coffee in the mouth, with additional flavors of dried fruit, brown sugar, and a touch of lactic sourness. Good body and a lasting finish. Complex, but perhaps a little muddled at the end. Still a very good porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Dark brown, almost black with a full two fingers of pillowy tan head...most of it remains, but what fades away leaves behind some very attractive lacing. One of the best porters I've smelled, honestly...roasted malts, caramel, vanilla bean and a hint of espresso. The taste is fantastic too...one of the richest porters I have ever tried. Just enough malt to produce a creamy, semi-sweet chocolate taste...dark roast coffee, toffee and even some floral hop and bready yeast in the finish. Mouthfeel is supreme for the style and the carbonation is where I enjoy it. Overall, I have to say this is one hell of a great porter...so drinkable at less than 6%.

Wonderfully strong aroma, robust toasted coffee with chocolate notes, very inviting. The flavor is also quite intense but does not match the sweetness from the aroma. Strong roasted coffee domintates, and the flavor doesn't change much from start to finish. Very dry, slightly bitter overall. The mouthfeel is semi-thick, has a nice smoothness, and is quite sharp on the carbonation for a porter. Drinkablity is superb on this one, it's not alcoholic, and there are no-off flavors, i just wish the taste had the same cascade of flavors as the aroma did....",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Black with tan head. Just what you would expect in a porter. Sheets of lacing are left behind after each sip. Smell starts to let you know that this isn't the typical porter though. It would be easier to list what I don't smell in this beer. It has that typical smoked smell but i also note cherries, coffee, chocolate and sweetness. Taste lives up to the anticipation from the smell. I really pick up the chocolate notes in the taste. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. This is the most drinkable porter that I've had in a long time.

Mild citrusy hops show at the finish and a lovely dark-roasted coffee taste lingers afterwards. Smooth mouthfeel; moderate carbonation and medium body.

73,226,heyitsbyron,4.5,"Tap beer poured into a paper cup (gasp!). That's life. I'll take free beer in a paper cup all year round (and I do).  Well, it's dark brown and only slightly cloudy. The head, however, is spectacular. About 2cm-- medium tan, laces well, nice and tight.  Smells toasty and kind of grassy. That's a good thing. Take a big whiff and it gets boozy and a little fruity. I think it smells wonderful.  Taste is nice and smoky, and choclatey. I think the roasted malts in this beer are absolutely perfect. The hops round out the flavor, but don't overpower. Both the roasted malt and the hops are very strong, but delicately balanced.  A bit ""chewy"", and very smooth. It feels great in my stomach and my mouth. Body is medium, especially for a dark beer, but well carbonated and satisfying. Just below the creaminess of Guinness.  I drink this beer probably more than any else because I it's available continuously to me during the winter. It's the old standby, and I very competent one at that. It has just the right amount of booze to drink continuously without getting too...sloppy. On the other hand, it satisfies the tastebuds and stomach. Hard for me to find anything wrong, especially for the price. I have yet to find a better porter and it's doubtful I ever will.  PS. I had Great Divide St. Bridget porter the other day. It's just one notch below this one.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

There is a wateryness to the flavor in the finish that is impossible not to notice. A very decent porter, but I think it is highly overrated. Just doesnt have enough ass to it.

Aroma has different things, but it seemed to always display a distinct smell at any one time. Hops, chocolate malt, and maybe a sweetness.  Pleasantly, this porter isn't too roasted. In the stout to porter scale of roastiness, I like my porters to be further away from stoats. Hopiness is not overdone but complements the overall taste well.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

They even said that this was printed with soy based ink. Great Lakes has some of best bottles and beer around.  Poured a dark ruby/brown color with less than a inch head of almost tan colored foam. It did dissipate fast, but it did leave some rigns around the mug though. When I first popped the cap, a nice aroma of hops came gushing out. When I poured it, the hops still remained, but in the background of dark roasted malt and coffee beans. I noticed in the front of the pack where those coffee beans and roasted malt flavors and then those bitter hops came out at the end. Not too bitter though. Bascially it tasted like smelled, but better. Gets better when it starts to warm up. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy and those bitter hops don't seem to want to go just yet. An excellent porter that is brewed only 30 mins from here, talk about drinking local. This is a beer that Porter lovers would enjoy over and over again.

Nice complex flavor, with roasted and chocolate-ish malts, a nice profile of slightly herbal and bitter hops, and a long aftertaste of burnt caramel flavors and some nutty/earthy tones.

The head is a thin light tan creamy that fades to a wisp. No sign of carbonation.  S- The smell of fresh deep roasted malt with notes of dark fresh ground coffee. The finish has a slight earthy note that adds more depth.  T- The big taste of dark roasted malt and some brown malt fill my taste buds. Then there is a rich cream flavor followed by fresh brewed dark coffee with that hint of earth and chocolate. The finish is a nice bitter hops that is a wonderful transition from the coffee notes.  M- This beer has a medium-full mouthfeel with a creamy texture. There is a very light fizz but no alcohol warmth or astringency.

Beautiful and pillowy.  Smell is roasted barley, chocolate, little hints of espresso, some vanilla, and a little bit of a musty hop scent. Quite nice.  Flavor is extremely dark and roasty, with the nearly-burned grain flavors melding well with the dark chocolate and vanilla flavors, which are more dry than sweet. The hops give an earthy bitterness on the back end, and the lingering finish is quite bitter, almost like black coffee. Yum.  Overall: Definitely worth all the hype it gets.

Taste; really nice roasted coffee flavor to start with, followed by some chocolate malts that is balanced with just enough hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice smooth carbonation.

Lacing is a little spotty, but otherwise beautiful.  The aroma is rich and earthy. Very nutty with some coffee flavors and a gentle roast. Amazingly complex and wonderful. The taste is certainly no exception, and seems to build on the complexities of the aromas.  The body is nice and robust, and not too dry. A gentle carbonation sooths the tongue.

Not as heavy as it could be, just a slight watery quality that distracts from the overall experience.  Mouthfeel- Sticky and chewy.  Drinkability- A perfect session beer.

When agitated the lacing becomes thicker and then diminishes a bit more to return to how it looked before.  The smell of this beer is good. It is easy to link the smell of this beer to the smell of fresh coffee. It also has a roasted smell to it. Most of the aroma that comes from this beer comes from the malt characteristics of this beer.  I like this porter because its taste is simple. There are three maybe four big flavors that I taste in this brew. I taste a coffee flavor, a chocolate flavor, and a roasted flavor. These are the three dominant flavors in this beer. I aslo notice another sweet flavor behind the roasted and chocolate flavor of this beer yet it is hard to describe as anything but sweet. Overall I like the flavor of this porter. It is definitely better than the Homebrew porter that I made from a brewer's best kit.  I really enjoy the mouthfeel of this brew as well. It is full bodied, and has a good amount of carbonation as well, there could be a little less in my opinion, but it is not overcarbonated. I would definitely buy this brew again.

The aroma of chocolate, coffee. Sweet malt.  Tastes of the chocolate, sweet fruit, coffee, and a little bit of hops, but not overpowering. Smooth mouthfeel.

Smell is rich with roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, coffee, toffee, smoke, and peat. Excellent balance and complexity. Taste follows through with the same flavors: roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, coffee, toffee, smoke, and peat and just a hint of alcohol. And it only gets better as it warms.

Scents of roasted malts, over-ripe fruits, vanilla, burnt toast and coffee.  The taste is proud and bold. I taste coffee grounds and hay/grass combined with strong roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, and it almost has a little sour effect of orange or grapefruit peelings. A grassy aftertaste intrigues me. The more I play around with this one, the more flavors seem to pop up. There's so much going on in the flavor of this beer, yet at the same time it all seems to be so balanced.  It definitly is a full-bodied beer, but I wouldn't call it heavy.

Beautiful porter, really REALLY dark brown, but still maintains some reddish tranluscence around the edges and the bottom of the glass. Thin khaki head that dissipates quickly but leaves a ring of lace through most of the glass.  Smell is great, malty, toasted warmth up front with notes of coffee and grains with a pleasant tang like dark fruit and a very balanced hop presence.  Taste....holy crap. Near perfection in a bottle. Coffee and malt upfront with just enough hop presence and a little bit of a sour twinge in the middle and finish that balances this beer perfectly and keeps it from being cloyingly sweet.  Very slick, very well carbonated, very substantial, all around excellent for the mouthfeel.  Drinkability, absolutely a 5. The end of my glass kills my soul. Perfect session beer.

Of course I like the style so that doesn't hurt and the White Sox were racking up double digits on about 17 TVs around me and that too might have artificially heightened the experience of this Porter.

73,226,DaPeculierDane,4.5,"Poured into a poboy's pint at the Cardinal Bar in Madison.  Deep coffee color and thick khaki head. Absolutely delicious. Charred coffee, rich mocha, chocolate, and caramelized sugars make up the aromas and taste. Texture is chewy and rich. The hops add the necessary bitterness to balance the malty sweetness.

Smells of roasted malt and chocolate. Toffee and nut are also present. Not terribly strong on the nose though. Very full flavor. Malt is strong on the tongue. Chocolate and a slight hop presence are also there. Very bold and sweet. In the mouth it is full, sweet and pleasant. There is a bit of post-swallow bitterness. Holds well. Although I am not a huge porter fan, this beer impresses. Nice full and sweet flavor that remains pleasant in the throat. One or two are enough for me.

Absolutely brilliant dessert drink!  Mouthfeel -- Medium and creamy. Very light carbonation.  Drinkability -- This is a porter to savor. It's excellent after dinner.

Pours a dark chocolate color w/ very little light shining through the glass, while a nice cocoa powder 1 1/2"" head springs atop of the body. Spongy, but not so dense head.  Aroma is of lots of toffee malts and some chocolate and slight coffee notes. Grassy hops come through as well as I expected considering the style. Nice.  Taste is much more mellow and more bitter than I originally expected. Not as sweet as most porters, however, the finish leaves a nice chocolate aftertaste in my mouth. Also some grassy hops help this one out a bit.  Very well balanced; the carbonation is light and the body is medium and a bit more creamy than most porters I've had previous.

73,226,BEERchitect,4,"A good example of what a Porter should be. Has all the dark colors and head retention that you'd expect. Aromas of chocolate and coffe abound. Balanced out with mild hop character and mild yeastiness or breadiness. Flavors of chocolate rise more than other flavors, but not to hide them. Has a nice creamy texture and finishes sweet, lightly bitter (from dark grains), and clean. A proper and simple beer.  ...of course that's what is expected from a Porter that meet all of the criteria for the style. But does meeting the style mean that a perfect 5 is deserved? No. The beer needs that 'something extra' that it lacks; making it a very, very good beer. But, not a great.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Starts off smooth and very slightly sweet on then goes very roasty with some slight dark chocolate then is very earthy espresso beans and some grassy hops in the finish. Taste of deep dark roasty espresso lingers on my tongue. The roasted character is lovely, not at all aggressive or overpowering but present and superbly dry. Low carbonation creates a viscous mouthfeel out of the medium low body. This would be a great session brew if i could get it regularly.

Smell: Roasty, with some coffee and a bit of chocolatey sweetness.  Taste: A strong, sweet start that rapidly moves toward roasted grain and coffee. Hops are detectable throughout, superbly balancing out the sweetness in the taste. This is a very well balanced brew, with the strong taste you'd expect from an excellent porter. The aftertaste is long and delicious.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth and creamy. Doesn't bite too hard, but you can definitely feel it. Superb.

73,226,99bottles,4.5,"This brewery makes so many fine beers and their porter is also worthy of recognition. The beer has a deep brown body, with ample thickness and a clump of dark tan head. The smell immediately lends itself notes of molasses and cocoa powder, mixed with some assertive hop bitterness. Flavorwise, the astringency of the roasted malt is balanced by a sweet toffee flavor and the beer stays firmly within the porter style, although it has whispers of Baltic porter strength and substance. The hops are outstanding and give it just enough life to keep it irresistibly drinkable. Reminds me of Storm King, with a little more finesse and a little more class. Even better as it warms to room temp. A great sipper.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Taste: At first a slight chocolate taste is present which then turns into a roasted coffee taste. At the very end you get hit by a slight hop bitterness.   Mouthfeel: A very full mouth feel with just the right amount of carbonation.   Drinkability: I could have about two of these in a row. Not a session beer in my opinion.

The aroma smells strongly of roasted barley, but some other sweet malt notes sneak through as well. The flavor backs-up the strong roasted smell with an immediate assault on your tongue. At the same instant, tons of coffee and caramel flavors arrive. However, the roasted malt is the dominant factor by far. The mouthfeel is outstanding. Substantial, but not quite so thick as to confuse it with a stout. Overall, I'd say it is perfect for the style. This is a very drinkable beer, but only for those who are fans of the roasted malts. Otherwise, it will likely be over-powering.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The taste is at the same time both smooth and full, with a strong aftertaste of hoppy goodness.

73,226,fretlessman71,4.65,"Pertinent Preliminary Comments: Heard so many things about this beer, and finally I get to try it. Great Lakes has produced many beers that Im a big fan of, namely the Dortmunder Gold and the Holy Moses White Ale. Also, this has one of the highest ratings on both Beer Advocate and Ratebeer  its gotta be good, right?  APPEARANCE: Translucent cherry coke reddish-brown. Tight, yet rocky beige head has huge gaps that somehow hold together. Lacing looks as if Im going to have to scrape it off with a dremel tool!  AROMA: Chocolate malt  anyone for some Ovaltine? Light hop detection, but malt is the big player here  VERY strong aroma. Have very happy nosehairs right now.  FLAVOR: Reasonably strong alcohol kick right off (strange for 5.8% ABV), but immediately followed by toasted chocolate malt with a pretty strong hop profile. Very good balance. Bitter cocoa in the finish, but all that does is make me want to take another sip. Good stuff! Simple, yet exquisite. This didnt last long at all.  MOUTHFEEL: Remarkably light for such a full-flavored brew. Carbonation just right.  DRINKABILITY: A beer that was gone all too soon. I could see having more than a few of these watching the river burn on a lazy afternoon.  OVERALL COMMENTS: Another outstanding brew from Great Lakes  its everything you ever wanted in a porter and less (mouthfeel!).",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Alternately dry and sweet maltiness up front. Morphs into strong roasted coffee bean flavors. This is like porter's greatest hits. Smoky, sweet, creamy and bitter.

Typical porter appearance, black and lightly carbonated, but that's the only way in which the Fitz can be described as less than exceptional. Easily the best scent, managing to smell like actual coffee, not burnt coffee. Taste is the same, coffeeish but in a sweet way as well as bitter, very smooth, nice finish.

I was not disappointed in the slightest and porters are quickly becoming a new favorite of mine.  Poured a jet black with a tall creamy tan head that rose quickly and spilled a little -- very active carbonation for a porter. Smell is beautiful, roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate with a light hoppy bite. Tastes amazing -- sweet chocolate, rich coffee with a light hoppy finish -- Delicious. Body is rich but not sticky, just right. A real treat. Almost up there with the Black Earth Porter from Great Dane. Definitely a porter fan from now on. Could drink these all day. Solid offering from Great Lakes. Highly recommended.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,RedwoodGeorge,4.48,"Wow - all in all a very, very nice brew here...  I gave this dark brew my standard pour which ended up being a bit more aggressive than called for - it seems that this is a pretty highly carbonated porter! Once the (minor) spillage was sopped up I was still left with a three finger head of sticky brown foam over a jet black brew. The head stuck around a surprisingly long time and left a lot of thick lacing on the glass.  The smell was plenty inviting with sweet malt notes, generous hints of coffee and a bit of vanilla as well. There were light hop notes in the background hinting that this wasn't purely a sweet brew but the malts are the belle of the ball here...  Taste is a different story - there are plenty of well balanced hops here to hold their own against the sweetness of the malts as well as the bitterness of the roasted flavors. This actually reminds me of one of my favorite dry stouts where they aren't afraid to put a little hops in to finish it nicely. Tastes are primarily coffee, sweet malt and vanilla with a good punch of piney hops for good measure. I'm always looking for balance and this brew's got it - in about four directions at once. First you notice the bitter roasted notes of coffee (or a tad of dark chocolate) balanced with the sweet, almost molasses flavors. A moment later you find the nice dry taste of hops mellowed with a very gentle vanilla. Complex and very well balanced.  Mouthfeel is equally balanced. It's a medium bodied brew that doesn't even approach syrupy or heavy, plenty of carbonation (as I discovered on the pour!) and just enough hops to leave a nice dry effect. I thought it was like drinking velvet and the beer felt very 'soft' on the palate.  Drinkable? I'd easily give this one a 'hell yeah!"" I like it when you can tell a beer came from a skilled brewer who really cared about their product. The love here shows and I'm looking forward to sharing the love again!

And, if my snout isn't mistaken, I smell a bit of chocolate. Very inviting.  Taste is very rich and actually a bit more bitter than the smell led on. Quite balanced in fact. Again I get a bit of chocolate (and caramel) in the flavor as this one warms up a few degrees.  Mouthfeel is just average for the style. It's also pretty drinkable, I have enjoyed several with a nicely grilled steak. Although, not a session beer for me.  This is a good quality porter. Not my favorite, but certainly one I will revisit.

Flavor is powdery cocoa, a bit of talc and tannin, not overly rich, but complex with other flavors of smokey burnt bark, peat, slightly burnt coffee, and sharp molasses.

Goes to show how palates change over time. This beer pours a dark brown with a light brown/tan head. The head slowly disipates to thin layer that stays around for a while. Mild lacing. The nose is of chocolate, malt, hops. The taste is chocolatey, malty, big caramel flavor on the back of the tongue. It has a nice bitterness to it is well.

The beer itself is a deep opaque brown, almost black but not quite. The aroma is one of dark roasted malt and unground coffee beans. Maybe something subtle like a chocolate or dark caramel contributing, but it's quite sublime.  The taste gives me first and foremost a great coffee impression, with a subtle dark or burnt malt contribution. That burnt malt flavor lingers in the aftertaste, but not offensively like a strong espresso might. Somehow the mouthfeel is simultaneously slight yet full, with a supportive body. Provides more satisfaction in the flavor and body department than the few other pedestrian porters I've had.  This is a nice beer that gives one the full flavors that might be expected in a stout, but less filling with a pleasant, mild drinkability.

The Edmund Fitzgerald porter poured a very dark brown. A tiny amount of light escapes with a dark red hue when raised to the light. Otherwise, this porter is as dark as night. The tan head was minimal and did quickly.  The aroma is very pronounced with strong notes of coffee, mocha and roasted malt. The taste is as strong as the aroma with the roasted malts taking center stage. Also, unlike some other porters I've had, the alcohol is apparent...not burning but it's there, even at 5.8%.

The beer poured essentially black with a bit of ruby showing at the bottom of the glass. A thick tan head formed and receded to form a thin cap. As I drank the beer a fine latticework of lace was left on the glass. Truly a looker.  The aroma reminded me a bit of powdered cocoa.  The taste was wonderful: bittersweet chocolate and coffee intertwined with hoppiness that is present, but doesn't over assert itself. Finish was dry, with a pleasant charred bitterness.

I've been drinking GLBC's Edmund Fitzgerald in bottles for some time and had a sample at the brewery several years ago. Recently I ran across it on tap at a local restaurant (Diamond River in Findlay) and felt it was about time to write a review.  Pours near-black with mahogany hues and a dense medium brown head.  Has a wonderful smell, with significant coffee and chocolate notes--and just a touch of molasses.  Very slight carbonation, with only a few bubbles.  Wonderfully balanced, with bitter chocolate, coffee, and the slightest touch of hops in the aftertaste.  If (God forbid!) I were to be limited to one style of beer, porter would be it--and if I could have only ONE example of that style, the Edmund Fitzgerald would be that beer.

Again, no real burnt flavors. Hops are nicely done and keep this from being too sweet. M: Full bodied without being too heavy. Carbonation was medium/high. Alcohol pleasantly warming. D&N: I've yet to try something from this brewery I haven't really enjoyed, and this is no exception. Very well balanced, easy to drink, nice and mellow. Super beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,fizzyfred,4.85,"Pours a deep dark color with a light dark brown head. The smell is full of roasted malt, chocolote and caramel. This beer tastes wonderful. Very nice and chewy malt flavor with a pleasant aftertaste. A little bit of hop bitterness comes through, but mostly it balances the very malty base nicely. This one is delicious.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,beveragecaptain,4.28,"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out black with a huge tan head. The aroma is caramel, chocolate, and most of all coffee. Roasted malt flavor. Coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and oak flavors. There is a nice spicy hop flavor, and the finish is bitter. This is how a porter should taste. Full mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. This is an amazing porter, and at $5 a sixer, it's an amazing value too.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Boto,4.23,"12oz. bottle: This beer pours an opaque brown. There was a bit of a tan head that died off rather quickly. Nice big whiff of chocolate to the nose. Also some notes of roastiness and nutiness. The taste is somewhat chocolate sweet, with a nice bitterness to it also. Very smooth and drinkable. Thanks, Jay!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,blackie,4.1,"Pours a very dark brown out of the bottle, allowing very little light to come through. Light tan head quickly dissipates, yet is easily recreated with a little swirling. Smells of sweet malt and chocolate, well balanced with the hops, very pleasing. Perfectly carbonated, not too much and not too little, producing a very nice mouthfeel. Taste is of sweet, chocolaty, earthy maltiness. Slight hop flavor, and just the right amount of hop bitterness to offset the malty sweetness. Finishes well, with a little sweet bitterness lingering after the swallow. My favorite of the Great Lakes sampler I acquired, as well as my favorite porter of those I have tried so far. One to buy again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,SupaCelt,4.2,"Appearance: Nice, purble, ruby, egg plant hue. Small, less than persistent tan head. Not much lacy elegance notable. Can't wait.  Smell: Definitely some kwoffee 'n dark and mysterious fruitiness. Azucar de tan. Milky chocolate seems feasible.  Taste: Superb flavour. I am completely enamoured with this thing as I reach the end of my plunge. ( Mouthfeel: ) Perfect texture. Smooth, rich chocolate that is at precisely the correct pitch to jive harmoniously with the beans. Hops are perfectly blended into the flavour scape. A balance that is tightrope worthy. A dark and rindy, bitter and smokey fat lady sings her storied part. This one earns the clout! I pine for another.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,goodbyeohio,3.76,"again, from an oversized taster at the brewpub..  this beer is black as night with a no discernible head. oatmeal stout was recommended over this one, but i went with the BA word-on-the-street and hung out with eddie.  lacing on this baby stays around and, when left unattended, forms a nice piecrust on my glass.  burnt brown sugar and chocolate malty offer a one-two punch. something about this beer reminds me of coffee-aftertaste.. coffee breath? in a good way? mild coffee notes in the flavor with a heavy chocolate-covered hazelnut kick. big tang follows and an overall lighter body makes this very drinkable.. the experience is rounded off by caramel and.. pretzel? flavors.  complex and a winner overall. cant believe this is an old standard out in the midwest.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Redrover,4.08,"12 oz brown longneck with clear freshness dating. Nice informative label.  The beer is very dark brown with a nice 1 inch tan head. Great lacing.  The aroma is of fresh roasted malts, caramel and a bit of bakers chocolate.  The taste is much like the smell initial taste of roasted malt with more than a hint of coffee (reminds me of the smell of a coffee roasting plant). Nice subtle hoping to counterpoint the toasted malts. Just a bit of chocolate flavor emerges late. No off notes at all. Tasty and it reminds me of Big Shoulders Porter from the defunct Chicago Brewing Co.  Nice thick and substantial mouthfeel. Extremely easy drinker to boot. Way to go Ohio (as the Pretenders say).",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Star80,4.88,"Ahh yes, the beer that set me straight as far as Porters go. Great Lakes could almost straighten out Richard Simmons given the chance! This one gave me a whole new outlook on the style and set a new personal best. Pours very dark, almost as black as their Blackout Stout. Head is not overwhelming but appears as a beige specter hovering on top. Delicate lacing is on the sides of my glass. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and faintly of hops. Tastes like coffee, toffee, roasted marshmallow and bittersweet dark chocolate! Mouthfeel is fine, actually great! I could drink these forever.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BeerFink,4.75,"The perfect looking porter, in my opinion. Looks black, with just a hint of deep red at the bottom of the glass. Light will just barely pass through it, showing up dark red. Frothy tan head crops up and leaves some sticky lacing on the glass. Good head retention. Aroma of dark malt, chocolate, mocha, dark fruit, and even a bit of hops. Good robust taste of coffee and chocolate, with some caramel undertones. I'm even detecting a little dark fruit in this one. Some good hop notes finish off the taste and lead to a perfectly balanced, slightly dry finish. Not too much or too little aftertaste, perfect finish. Although its a pretty robust taste, it is an extremely drinkable porter.  This is the beer that got me into GLBC. I remember ordering several of these in a row the first time I tasted this, simply because they were that good.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,tom444,4.03,"Pours a dark cola brown, with about half an inch of thick, tan head.   Smells of rich roasted malts, with a bit of a burnt aroma.  Tastes of a good bit of roasted malts, with some chocolate and coffee notes, and a little bit of a nutty taste. A decent amount of hop bitterness.  Leaves a nice chocolate/coffee aftertaste.  A great porter to enjoy with a meal or just for the sake of drinking good beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,longarm,4.12,"Thick tan foam cascades from the pour as a dark brew billows from the depths of the glass. Large bubbles rest on the top of the beer. A short rest leaves a thin but not unnoticeable head.  Aroma has a hint of something akin to blackberries. Unusual for a beer, but it fits exceptionally well with this dark style. Hop aroma is also present but not dominant.  Flavor is slightly sour with mild roasty/chocolate malt bitterness. A strong hop flavor appears at the finish. The end result is quite smooth with only a slightly sour aftertaste still wetting the palate for more.  This is certainly one of the better porters I've had. Easy to drink, complex and quite smooth.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,twelvsies,3.8,"I like Great Lakes. This porter pours a real nice dark brown color with little dark red highlights around the sides. Nice thick tan head floating on top. Smell is a bit hoppier than most porters I'd say, but there's also a strong roasted malt smell and a hint of sweet chocolaty scent. Taste is again a bit hoppier than most porters, kind of hits you up front and then comes the malt. There is a nice sweetness to this beer but it's really subtle and you have to pay attention to notice. Mouthfeel is smooth but maybe a little watery? I don't know what to think of this beer. On St. Patty's day I drank one of these for the first time, out of a bottle too, and thought it was fantastic. Maybe that was just because I had a Guinness right before that. So I went out and bought a couple bottles and brought them back to Mass with me and these ones don't seem to have the complexities that I initially noticed. I wish I could get some out here but it doesn't come here unfortunately. Don't get me wrong, it's a good porter. But I originally thought it was living up to all the hype as one of the best but the next two bottles haven't quite been as good as the first. Weird. I'll try some more sometime.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,bnuttz,4.5,"pours a very dark ruby color, almost black, with a nice dark tan head. Smell is charred, charcoal like, very burnt, but yet very chocolatey at the same time.

73,226,shapudding,3.9,"Dated August 26, 2004. Dark and clear chestnut, but held to the light you can catch a bit of ruby. Khaki dusting in a ring. Wonderful aroma, thick chocolate and coffee with a bit of hops shooting through. Nice and dark! Smooth and silky, barely feel the carbonation, but not flat at all. Chocolate and hoppy flavors, bit with a snap in there... but yet smooth. Very nice and highly enjoyable! Thanks to Brandon/Pissky for this gifted brew!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,asabreed,4.95,"A hyped up beer for sure, as many know by now. And this lives up to the hype ten fold. Picked up a case for around $28.  Of the many porters I've had, it seems -- though I may be wrong -- that an average porter seems to be pretty standard, meaning I guess there are many average ones out there versus many that I wouldn't even want to try. However, I've yet to come across one as delicious and balanced as Edmund Fitzgerald.  Appearance: Beautifully black and opaque, with a mocha-colored lace that keeps pretty sticky to the glass. Red / Amber tint to it in the light that's also quite gorgeous.  Smell: Wow. Chocolate. Honey. Mocha / Coffee. Dark berries. The faintest hop nose to complement the sweeter accompaniments.  Taste: Again, wow. Balance all the way through, and a finish that may rival the best beers I've ever tasted. Nothing ever seems overpowering, as if everything is working together all the time. Yet it remains complex even after you swallow and the flavors are still on your tongue. All the smells above seem discernible, in addition to a lingering fruitiness that I can't pin down. Amazing.  Mouthfeel: Once again, it's dark, so the body is chewy, but also deceptively light, which makes it very interesting to swish around a bit.  Drinkability: For a Porter, I could certainly make this a session, as mainly because the hops and malt never seem to overpower each other, and though the body may be a bit chewy, it's also light, which makes Winter not necessarily the only season to drink this I feel. Can't wait to have many more of these.  Great Lakes continues to impress me, and this is not only no different, but I don't know if they make a better beer. I want to try the Blackout Stout, as seemingly that may be the only one that can rival Edmund Fitzgerald.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,kmpitz2,4.47,"Its been a while since I had this one. It pours a deep brown color with a slight ruby hues. There is a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is full of roasted coffee tones, with a slight chocolate in there as well. The flavor is very full, starting with a blast of coffee, fading really quickly to sweet chocolate, finishing slightly bitter. The feel is nice moderate to slightly thick. Overall, I really like the flavor and feel of this one. Everyting works very well together. I dig it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BobLuvBeer,4.03,"Deep mahogany color with medium mocha colored head. Wonderful chocolate/roasted malt aroma-not coffee scented, which it shouldnt have, but is still nice to not bee there, and worth a mention. So many porters swing to the stout way, and leave their roots behind. Back to the beer Blend of chocolate malt and roasted flavor. Chocolate flavor rests below the heavy roasted taste, which dominates the drink. Very light on the plate overall. Almost 1 dimensional where the roasted flavor is all you get for the most part. Although, there are different levels of the roasted malt in the taste, there should be something else there that isnt which would help with the body and feel.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

A nice vibrant mix of aromas...big roastiness, bittersweet chocolate, hints of coffee and a nice hop nose. Very nice.  First sip brings a wonderful roasty, burnt maltiness along with a nice mix of bittersweet chocolate, ground coffee and a nice piney, floral hop bitterness that plays along with the sweetness. This is a wonderfully well balanced porter and just so damn tasty. Yum.  Mouthfeel is damn near perfect for the style...a nice medium body with small bubbly carbonation. I'd have to say this brew is incredibly drinkable...easily sessionable. Yet another super tasty, enjoyable brew from Great Lakes..one of my favorite midwest brewers!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,elricorico,4.42,"Pours very dark, I'd say almost a mix of dark purple and dark brown. Has a fizzy tan head that fades into a ring. Looks tasty.  The smell is nice and strong, coffee, chocolate and a fresh smell hiding behind that, that makes me think of cold milk. Very appetizing.  Taste is good, strong coffee flavour with a dry bitter finish that hangs on for some time. Nice balance throughout.  This beer has some creaminess, and is very comfortable to roll on your tongue. Feels like it moves a little slowly across the tongue.  Drinkability? Well, I am crushed that this is my last bottle, and I may not see this beer again for some time, cause I'd love to sit down with this beer on a quiet evening and enjoy several bottles.

73,226,assurbanipaul,3.41,"Pours a deep chocolate brown with a beige head. Aroma is dark malts, some cocoa and red grapes.  Taste is patent malt with a slight vinous element. Ashy, espresso and Dutch cocoa flavors, bittersweet but not quite cloying. Hints of wine around the edges like a pinot noir. Reminds me of a very light milk stout.  Mouthfeel is thick and grainy. A good stout, I've tried it before on tap. Quite drinkable but not a Top 50-caliber beer, in my opinion.

Smell: The smell is a very appetizing blend of coffee and cocoa with a hint of bitterness.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The taste is like liquid velvet the whole way, with wonderful coffee, roasted, and bittersweet notes everywhere. The combination of these with a wonderfully seductive hop presence combines into a porter that's flavor is truly one of the best in the world. Smooth, creamy, full of power and still balanced enough to bring one to their knees, this beer tastes like heaven on earth.  Drinkability and Overall: I absolutly love this porter. One of the best I've had to date. The wonderul flavors and seductive aromas make this beer dangerously drinkable. This is a phenomenal porter that just doesn't quit. I love it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Fine aroma, rich chocolate, some caramel and some roasted coffee.  Medium-full body, soft carbonation. Big roasted coffee flavors start out and are smoothly blended with a bitter-sweet chocolate flavor. Out of nowhere a light floral hoppiness comes in and blends with the roasted coffee flavor in the aftertaste, surprising, but welcome.  A fine porter indeed.

73,226,ypsifly,4.85,"Yep...this one lives up to the hype!  Dark and stout looking with a cream colored head of over 1"" that leaves gobs of foamy lace as it goes down. I noticed some falling after pouring.  Smells of roasted malts and coffee, with some toffee or caramel thrown in. A slight hoppiness can be detected as it finishes.  Tastes of blended and roasted malts that start off in the direction of an Imperial Stout but quickly mellow with a slight sweetness that turns into a hop inspired dry finish. This one hits all the notes of the style perfectly.  The generous use of malts combined with just the right amount of hops and carbonation make for a perfectly full mouthfeel, and a very drinkable beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,karst,4.75,"Bittersweet chocolate coffe aroma from a perfect apearing Stout from its dense 2-3 fing tan head to its clear dark(ruby red- against strong light) liquid. I filled a pint glass with Corral liquors and Schlafly advertized on its outside (This year's Schlafly Coffee Stout is great this year!) Thanks to Joe B. @ Corral in Granite City, Ill. for keeping his Great Lakes brews in Frig. and reminding me of the need to do the same due to its lack of pastuerization and preservatives!)  Inside the glass a persistant head (for stouts) settles leasurly, its remants clinging as sticky lace. Meanwhile I'm huffing the aroma from Pale English Crystal and Chocolate malts with roasted Barley mingled with Northern Brewer, Kent Golding and Cascade botanicals- all providing a bold hop presence to play pranks on my tongue and palate.  A tast that matches the aroma is very pleasing to the palate. Its well balance ""fat"" medium body (excellent for style) A subtile aftertaste that gives you a long loving bite with its low bitterness and roasted malts. At 45°F I drink it slowly anticipating its evolving tastes as it warms. With each warming tilt of my glass it shows off its excellent complexity and fine balance of hops and sweet roasted malts.  THE best Porter that I have tasted to date - Leaves me wondering if the smooth, well balanced dry coffeish taste can be improved  note: ABV had dropped 0.5% since Michael Jackson gave it an excellent review in his Great Beer Guide 2000 ed.  A last swirl - it easily awakens and sends up a dying coating of fine bubbles (great C02 level). A great Ship to go down on.

This is the sort of porter that other porters aspire to be like, this is the Michael Jordan of porters as far as I'm concerned, all kneel before the altar and say a prayer, because it's over folks.  This is a perfect mid-winter in front the fireplace sort of beer. It's hearty and filling and highly drinkable. It pours a dark black with a respectable copper brown head. The nose is a bit sweet with an organic grain overtone to it, you smell how hoppy it is too, makes my brain scream ""Pavlovian response!!"". The initial taste isn't explosive, more understated and subtle than that, but lives up to it's nose perfectly. A slight dark chocolate creaminess surrounded by an almost black tea like organic overtone but there is also a strong, strong hop character here with roasted coffeebean and a dry aftertaste that stays with the palate long after swallowed. The mouthfeel is gorgeous, silky and balanced.  Great Lakes did a wonderful job in the design and execution of a truly great porter.

Some hints of grape and caramel are noticeable as well. Taste is incredible. There is a certain smoothness to the beer. The malts are quite varied. There seems to be some roasted malts, along with some caramel malts to balance out the black patent. Very good ratios for this American Porter. Mouthfeel is quite bubbly and has just the right feel for a porter. It's not too dry and it's not too sweet.

A top the body rose about an inch worth of tan foamy head that disappears fairly quickly leaving some rings of lace. A strong roasty malt aroma was first noticed before the chocolate malt set in. Very rich in the nose. Coffee was also present. The taste was a mix of bittersweet chocolate over a roasted malt and coffee. There was a good amount of earthy bitterness present as well. This ends on a slightly bitter roasted coffee note. Mouthfeel was about medium but fell a little short but was still creamy and rich. Good drinkability here as the mix of flavors keep this interesting and well balanced. This is definitely up there on my porter list.

73,226,crookedhalo,4.3,"Pours a deepest brown color with a light tan head. Good roasty malt profile with all the coffee and chocolate notes one tends to expect from a porter. Fairly hopped, which is a nice addition to any porter. Aggresively roasty, slightly fruity and mildly hoppy; makes for a beautiful balance. Wickedly drinkable. Probably Great Lakes best offering, in my opinion.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,SCW,4.35,"I think it is fair to say that this beer has become legendary in its own right. When I think of some the classic (readily-available) American microbrewed porters, I think of Deschuttes Black Butte Porter, the Alaskan Smoked Porter, and yep, this one.  It's pretty amazing this beer has become so popular in the Midwest, where the majority of beer drinkers - and even craft beer drinkers - don't lean towards the darker beers. I can see how this beer has converted many -  For me, the most amazing thing about this beer was the balance. There was such a perfect amount of flavor hops in the finish, it perfectly balanced the toffee/roastedness of the grain bill.  Remarkably, you could smell these hops in the nose of the beer, and it was enticing everytime I took another sip.  I'm glad this beer is becoming more and more readily available.

Excellent looking beverage- nearly black, opaque body covered by a chunky, truly brown head. The aroma was that of a good bakery with coffee pouring. Malt and sweetness abound.  A full taste without being cloying. Not as alkaline as some Porters strike me. Leaves with a nice clean finish.  This is a Prince among Porters. Since it isn't available in my area, I forgot about it, despite having lived in Ohio for nearly ten years.  My wife picked this up for me in Wisconsin when I asked for Lakefront!

The appearance was a dark brown/black not totally opaque. The perfect ammount of carbonation. A few trails up the glass after pouring. The smell of it is a combination of a chocolate/coffee/sweetness. The aftertaste is mostly chocolate and long lasting. Mouthfeel, is smooth and thick.

This pours transparent black, or deep deep brown. It poured up with a nice head, which remained to some extent throughout the drink. Towards the end there was a filming and ring around the edge. Some lacing was stuck to the glass. Quite nice.  Smells good, nice and unsweetened choclatey with a hop hint.  Tastes is very smooth chocolate with a nice hoppy balance. I don't know how they get a floral scent in the taste, but it is wonderful.  Mouthfeel is quite nice and creamy.  The finish (oops, I just finished it) - the finish is also creamy, with bitter almost coffee like notes at the back of the throat. It really is more chocolate like.

I could pick up vanilla and coffee undertones. The only thing about this beer is that it is almost a little too intense for a porter.

Taste is very well balanced between hoppiness and maltiness, almost like a struggle on your tounge. The Maltiness and roasty flavors come through in the finish.

73,226,GCBrewingCo,4.53,"The beer poured clear brownish black with a ruby highlight. The head was brown, large, and in charge. It coated the glass as it fell and laced it as the beer was consumed.  The aroma was deep bittersweet chocolate and a strong expresso coffee presence. Some fruitiness developed as the beer warmed and was consumed. Caramel flavors were present but took a backseat to the chocolate and roastiness.  The flavor was bittersweet chocolate and expresso coffee with a substantial bittering component that added complexity. The flavors were well blended yet still maintained an individuality which added complexity to the flavor.  The finish was bitter chocolate and coffee lasting long into the aftertaste and drying out to bone dry in the final analysis. The body was medium.  12 ounce bottle. Add some oats and roasted barley, boost the body and this would stand as a well as a stout. Very well done.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Dithyramb,4.05,"Sampled at the Great Lakes restaurant this Tuesday night. Served at just the right temperature in an imperial pint glass. Since it was getting chilly out, I was looking for something hardy to wash down the spicy mustard coated barley pretzels. Our very nice waitress immediately suggested the porter. Color was the shade of a roasted chestnut. It was flirting with opaqueness, but showed a deep, dark brownness when put to the light. There was dense tan foam that lasted through at least half of the pint. Even then, a gooey lacing was spaced well. Some nice carbonation was bubbling along the inside of the glass. A cocoa and caramel smell was predominant with just a whiff of woodsy stuff on the backend. All the tasty porter flavors are here, with a very complex mix of bitter and sweet malts. The bitter coffee and sweet toffee malts just ooze over your tongue. A very faint hop is in there somewhere, but not much. Given my choice of food and attitude this evening, the GL porter is exactly what I needed/wanted. The porter has a very full body. It finishes dry in your mouth, but leaves a bit of the clingy malts in there as well. Well worth a few, which is very difficult, given all the high quality taps at the restaurant.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BrewMaster,4.35,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with a creamy looking head over a glass of dark brown beer. The aroma is roasty with a bit of alcohol sweetness to it. The taste is full of crisp roastiness with chocolate, toast, caramel, and ending with a touch of floral hop flavor. It has a medium body on the palate with a clean finish.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,garymuchow,4.33,"Many thanks to WVbeergeek for this great bottle of brew.  Drank sample just under best by date. Aroma shows nice raost malt with a hint of sweetness. Has a stout like quality. Little hints of butterscotch. Pours black, but red hues in the light. Appears clear. Full head that recedes slowly. Sporadic lacing. Wonderful roast flavors. Chocolate, a little coffee and bittersweet (as the label says). Pleasing longish dry finish. May be a bit thin, otherwise great carbonation balance. Good softness both in feel and carbonation. This is what I think of when I think of a porter. Gold standard status for me, just wish I could get this regularly.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,edchicma,4.53,"Thanks to wyllder for this exceptional brew! Poured almost black with a beautiful light chocolate head taht lasts...nice lacing. Smell is rich...malt...coffee...chocolate. Taste likewise is malt, coffee, chocolate...balanced with a nice hop presence throughout. Mouthfeel is a tad chewy....with a dry casting produced by the hopping. Smoooth on the drinkability scale...road trip to Cleveland???? Great brew.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BarrelBrother,4.87,"When the winters turn brutal in the Chicagoland area, I love a deep, dark, aromatic brew for those long winter nights by the fireplace. I search out the porters, stouts, Irish & Scotch ales that promise deep, rich flavor to warm your soul and relax your mind. Well EFP (Edmund Fitzgerald Porter) meets all these qualities in spades and keeps me ordering a case a month through those long winter nights even after the holidays. If you like porters this one is an excellent example of combining aroma, taste, and drinkability into one outstanding brew.  Deep garnet in color when held to the light, a strong toasty, chocolate/carmel aroma and a taste that always satisfies with multiple taste overtones (especially a subtle semi-sweet chocolate flavor) keeps me coming back for more. The mouthfeel is as close to velvet in your mouth that I could imagine. I can sip on these all night long, actually I have! Alcohol content is not too high to prevent quaffing a number of these beauties. An outstanding American porter. If you favor deep, dark, flavorful brews try EFP, you'll be glad you did.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Crosling,3.31,"Brown.  Moderately aromatic, with notes of currants, sweet malts, dark malts, chocolate, bold hops, onions and alcohol.  The malts provide notes of prunes, coffee and chocolate while other notes of brown sugar and molasses are present. The hops are bold and very prominent but in this porter it just didn't work. Too hoppy for its style in my opinion.  Not that good.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,skybluewater,4.2,"Finally, I get to try this one, which I've heard a lot about. Bottle says ""Enjoy by Jul 22 /04""-Oops! Pours what appears to be black, but is really dark mahogany. In fact, I can actually see through this beer. Big, big head recedes, leaving a tiny bit of lace. Smells like a chocolate coffee bar, very nice. Taste is of bitter coffee and chocolate.  Very quaffable porter here (the fact that it's past due really didn't affect the taste, although I'd love to try a fresh sample), but I probably wouldn't travel long distances for it again (I got this in Wisconsin). But if you see it somewhere, don't hesitate to grab a sixer or two for those cold days ahead. Just be sure to check the date!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,gentlebubbles,4.23,"Milk chocolate fluff of moderately coarse foam builds up to an inch or so, and presently sighs away. Dark chocolate resists the passage of light, letting through the barest ruby highlight.  Sweet winey, raisiny scent lingers all the way down the glass.  Fruity, plummy chocolate with hints of smoke and a lingering port-like finish which morphs into more smoke that licks around the lips. And meanwhile sticky sweet malt glues itself tingling to the tongue as a subtle piney resin slowly emerges. Whoa. This is getting interesting.  Light-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Easy to drink. A tasty, right down the middle and out of the park home run porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,bewareOFpenguin,4.8,"I waited a long time for this beer, and was not disappointed. It was black, sun blotting out dark. Nice choco head. It could easily pass for a stout, with a rich coffee taste. The hops sang out with each sip, which was a pleasant surprise. This was a great beer, porter or stout.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,frazbri,4.71,"Pours black with ruby accents when held to the light. Chocolate aroma with minimal hop aroma. Thick moca head, long lasting with lots of lace. Chocolate with mild bitterness, a little bit of roasted flavor and a slightly tangy taste. Full body, almost chewy. For a rich full bodied beer, it is extremely drinkable.  This beer stradles the border of stout and porter. I don't get too hung up on style. This is one of my favorites. A must try for lovers of porter and stout.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,sabrills70,3.88,Pours a dark brown with a nice 2 finger off white head and excellent lace. Reddish colors appear when held to the light. Smells of wonderful roasted malt with chocolate and coffee. Taste is very good. A nice sticky swet malt with nice coffee flavors. Nicely balanced with the hops. It's not heavy at all like I expected it to be. I could drink lots of this.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,OhioBulldog,4.67,"Pours opaque black with a medium tan/beige head. Head dispersed to leave a good lacing around the glass. Nose is of a wonderful deep chocolate and caramal roasted malts, some sweet notes, and a small hop background. Taste explodes with flavours of chocolate and sweet malts, then blends to a big roasted malt and coffee, and finishes dry with hops. Very balanced and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is excellently creamy and smooth, perfect amout of carbonation. Drinkability is great also, i could down quite a few of these on a night.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Pegasus,4.08,"Appearance: Deep mahogony brown in color with a moderate tan head, with thick, glass coating lace.  Aroma: Slight dark caramel and molasses notes with dominating coffee and bitter chocolate flavors.  Taste: Opens with sweet caramel malt notes which form the undercurrent of the taste throughout, quickly followed by warming alcohol, then coffee and bitter chocolate notes, which persist long past the finish. Throughout the taste there is a rather understated hop presence that moderates the rich malt character.  Mouth feel: Smooth and full with low carbonation.  Drinkability/notes: A superb porter; it manages to distinguish itself in a style noted for excellence. Superb on a dark and cold afternoon. An elegant rememberance to those lost on that long ago day, November 10th, 1975, requiescat in pace.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,trancefishy,4.12,"i let this one sit for 30 minutes at room temp (not long enough), so that i could review it through it's full temp range, as it changes quite a bit. pours out really dark, though, when held to the light, it comes through, and it's a really dark red. the aroma is wonderful, and reeks of sticky sweet rich malts and dark chocolated. be sure to give this one some good whiffs. taste is much like the aroma, but, with an unbalanced hop bitterness and a the sharp tang of a char taste somewhere. that is when it is first drank. once it warms up a bit, the bitter all but disapears, and the char taste dissolves and balances itself out with the bittersweet chocolate and warm, sweet alcohol tones. feels great in the mouth, a bit viscous, but good overall. mild carbonation present in the mouth. i like this one, and it's what all porters should strive to be, although, they almost never are and so i generally avoid the style.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ken3c,4.33,"1"" creamy head, very dark. Opaque. Islands of foam leave beautiful lacing.  Roasted malt smell with chocalate.  Tastes of coffee, carmel, chocalate wonderfully blended. Dry finish.  Fairly carbonated and a little less than heavy.  Very drinkable; Very yummy.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Ninjaworm,3.75,Bottle Best by: 9/21/04  Appearance: The color seems to be that of a very robust brown almost a light black. Does not seem to lace very much with a quickly eroding beech head.  Smell: Seems to be that of medium bodied burnt coffee aroma that it followed by hints of chocolate and toffee.  Taste: Surprisingly the alcohol in the beer is very present even though the some what low content. I find the coffee nature of the beer to be overshadowed by the burn tones as it spreads through my palate.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation helps spread the wonderful burnt flavor. At times the carbonation almost seems overwhelming as it causes a slight burning feeling as the gas departs the precious liquid. As I swallow all flavors are overshadowed by a sweet sensation.  Drinkability: I would not rank this beer as my top pick of porters but this would go wonderfully with a spicy seasoned London broil with some garlic mash potatoes.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Ricochet,3.96,"Appearence: Dark but not completely black with just a hint of amber and poured intentially without a head. Good for porters.  Smell: Typical porter. A little chocolate, a little coffee. Average.  Mouthfeel: Again, typical. Foams a little, swallows with a traditional bitter note.  Drinkability: High! This beer goes down so easy and quickly, you could drink a 6 quickly before you realized what this 6 costs.  Taste: As advertised. A good porter with typical notes of most porters with nothing special that leaps out. This would probably be better from the tap.  All in all, good porter but not my favorite from the bottle. I'd buy this if I was thirsty for a darker beer and they did not have any other porters.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,twilight,4.43,"Thanks to Tikkigodxxx for the sample.  I'm drinking this blah porter thinking, 'I don't really like porters' or ' Yeah, this one is okay,' until I see my number ratings. Everything is in place. This is an exceptional porter. Then why am I not really into it? Dunno.  Pours black as night with a small head that gives way to a slight lace ring around the glass. Smell is slight burnt, roasty with a hint of powdered cocoa. Taste is. Well, taste is kind of plain. It has an exceedingly subtle flavor that even after a few sips I can barely name. Roasty malts, burnt chocolate with a lightly beautiful aftertaste just lingering on the palate. Mouthfeel is absolutely beautiful. What is it about most porters just going down smooth? Drinkability? Up there, you betcha. I could sip this one all night. Too bad I've only one bottle to keep me warm tonight.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Hops become mildly present at the end and a nice finish. Smooth and nicely carbonated with a full finish at the end. Picked up a slightly acrid bite at the end though.  Drinkability: The first Great Lakes offering I experienced back in high school over ten years ago, and probably what converted me to a GLBC lover. I drank loads of this growing up in Ohio and attending college there as well, and still would if only it was available in NC.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Head was long-lived, and lacing was excellent. Aroma is deeply of coffee malts, with some sweetness and chocolate malts to soften the edges. Taste is follows the nose, with the coffee flavor lingering on the palate, but not in a bad way. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent.

73,226,HardTarget,4.42,"Bottle Inspection: Best by date (8/4/04- beat it by just a couple days) and serving temp suggested (45 degrees) and a note about the purity law. Aroma: Cold coffee, toffee and a hint of cream in the nose. Inviting. Appearance: Clear deep brown edges on a black body. It showed a collar of leathery tan small bubbles that laced lightly. Flavor: A nice coffee porter. Has a lot of bitterness going on, bittersweet chocolate and a coffee bitter that lasted long into the aftertaste. Some minor floral hops noted on a deep roasted rich malt base. Mouthfeel: Medium body with some fuzzy carbonation. A touch over carbonated for my tastes. Overall Impression: A very high quality beer. Im a new fan of Great Lakes Brewing. This is a rich tasting beer, so rich I dont think I could make a session out of these, but I could see revisiting the old girl now and again.

73,226,profzoom,4.35,This fine beer looks like a good porter should - extremely dark. No way you can see through that glass. The smell is also excellent and typical of a good porter - a delicious roasted chocolatey aroma. The taste is also fantastic. All in all a superb brew.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,RoyalT,4.18,"Appearance  Dark, muddy, almost black in color with a gorgeous head that came up with ease and down with much protest. It left some cool pits on top of the liquid and some nice lacing as well.  Smell  The chocolate came across the room at the pour. Like LBB said, its more of a cakey kind of chocolate than anything else. The coffee grounds are very sharp and forward as well. I can pick up some darkish malt but it is mostly trumped by the coffee and chocolate notes.  Taste  Theres an interesting bitterness that comes out at the taste, but otherwise the tongue follows the nose.  Mouthfeel  Close to medium-bodied with some very slight carbonation. The flavor profile here really sets off the taste buds in the front part of your tongue.  Drinkability  This is a terrific, easy-drinking session porter, if there is such a thing.  Comments  Thanks to garthwaite for sending me not one, but two of these babies.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,garthwaite,4.77,"Sampled on tap at the brewery. This gorgeous brew is a deep dark brown that approaches black with a thin lasting, sticky tan head. Smeet aroma that immediately gives notice of the quantity of chocolate malt & roasted barley used in this brew. Additional hints of chocolate covered cherry, roasted coffee, & a touch of both floral hops & campfire ash. Once in the mouth, this is absolutely delicious. A brief initial wave of bitterness is devastated by a huge, complex dark malt portfolio. Roasted coffee & bittersweet chocolate balanced beautifully by flavors of dark fruit & English hops. Medium bodied with a pleasant velvety mouthfeel. Long lasting bittersweet dry finish. Fresh on tap, the drinkability on this one is through the roof.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,soilguy,4.8,"This is without a doubt the best porter I have drank to date, and being that porter is one of my favorite styles, I've tried a good many. This beer came in a pint glass, through which I could just barely make out some translucency in the beer. It had a wonderful off white head and a rich, chocolaty aroma. The taste starts out with a tease of sweetness, which then becomes a complex blend of chocolate, malt, and slightly roasted flavors. This is one beer that I absolutley cannot have just one of. I would bring my wife to the pub to be my DD, but she likes this as much as I do!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,wyllder,4.49,"First off: Big thanks go out to matcrill for the chance to sample this!  Edmund pours a deep ruby, chocolate brown, leaving a fizzy 1/4 inch caramel head that eventually recedes and leaves a sticky lacing as you go.  Nose is a delicious chocolate cream with an almost thick, buttery backbone to the scent. Talk about piquing your interest! Unlike many beers, their is no hint of bitterness about smell, it's wonderful in the subdued chocolate creaminess of it.  The first hit on the palate is at once sweet, even tart, with a crisp carbonated feel. By the midsip a nice caramel malt plays in as the sweetness begins to recede. The fade out to the aftertaste is a blissful receding of sugary tartness that reveals a deep, creamy chocolate flavor with subtle hints of coffee blended in.  Mouthfeel is a bit too tart for my liking, though in a way this actually adds to the receding effect as the tartness backs off to reveal the creamy aftertaste.  Overall, this is terribly good stuff!

73,226,RocketWidget,4.23,"Cheers to Buckeyenation for the opportunity to try this brew.  Now this is a porter! Pours a deep black, light brown if held to the light. Good, lacy, long lasting, light off yellow head that clings to the side of the glass. Smells sweet, malty, and chocolaty. Taste delicious. Has that great porter taste, sweet and slightly hopped in the aftertaste. Malty and sharp flavor. Very drinkable and smooth, especially for a porter. A top notch brew.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,ngandhi,4.52,"In terms of depth, Edmund Fitzgerald Porter's closest companion would be an imperial stout. Dark yet creamy chocolate from some place that isn't America or Britain introduces itself to you and then takes a nap on your tongue as if it had always lived there. And I'm welcoming him into my home.  The roasted nose hints at a lightly fruity hoppiness and the chocolate draws our attention away from it until the end when a natural bitterness adds complexity to the malt, as if we are moving through a tasting of different percent cocoas, and synergistically opens to bright, drying hops and a latent yeasty cream.  Despite all this and a finish that not only lingers but develops unabated for well over 2 minutes (I timed it), Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is as quaffable and liquid as a cold hefe on a mid-summer day.  The body of this beer is dynamic, apparently full because of the dark malt, but light from a healthy attenuation of sugars and frizzante carbonation that is just lively enough to dissect the roast flavors and make what could have been an overpowering beer accessible to the masses.  Relax, relax. ng",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,noclue,4.32,"Very dark pour with slight hints of amber. A nice almost foamy head that stuck around until the last drink. The aroma was my favorite aspect of this fine porter. Almost overwhelming Chocolate/Espresso aromas with a hint of smoke.  This is an extremely strong porter, with a pleasing roasty, hoppy bitterness. The EF seemed to be heavier to me than most porters, almost stout-like, which complimented the taste very well.  I highly recommend this beer, but due to the intensity, I can hardly drink more than one. Easily my favorite porter!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,GreenWBush,4.6,"GLBC. One of those breweries I simply didn't understand the fuss about until I hit upon the Burning River pale ale. I've seen the light now, so its about time to sample one of their most highly acclaimed, the EF porter. I quiver with anticipation.  Presented in a 20 oz. Imperial pint tumbler. Black with slight ruby translucence. Dirty-moon 1 1/2"" head that leaves a slightly paper-bag like lace.  The nose is an amazing amalgam of roastiness and hoppiness, a tug of war that continues all the way through the beer. There are also huge hints of espresso and chocolate here.  The taste is nutty rich with a slightly smoky influence. They somehow figured to milk out the smoothness of nitro without the flavor-degredation. The hop characteristic cuts through the dark-night of major roastiness enough to make even Nick Floyd happy.  The drinkability is actually fairly low on this one. Such a complex and fine beer that only one is enough. Enough cannot be said for drinking this one just about cellar temperature, because a beautifully delicate sweetness appears that makes the package absolutely undeniable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The aroma is like a dark-roasted coffee with hints of chocolate and a heavy hop thing going on as well.  The taste is a phenominal blend of what the aroma gave away, a heavier porter than most, almost a bit imperial stout like that has everything going for it. The mouthfeel is a little harsh on the palette but everything else goes down fine. The drinkability is well above par, wondering how this beer went down in only 10 minutes.

73,226,Foxman,4.7,"It pours a deep, rick inky brown, but comes across as black, until you see flashes of ruby where light dares pass through. Two fingers of light brown head swell gently and settle, like chocolate mousse melting to a frothy puddle. Sticky, winding lacing roams the inside of the glass.  The aroma delivers dark roasted malt, offering a melange of chocolate, coffee, and licorice. Cherry and berry notes lurk earthily in the mix. A sherry-like presence closes along with an outlying hops bitterness.  The first sip brings the dense, earthen bittersweet character of long-roasted malt, bearing espresso and dark chocolate. A cherry fruit tanginess tangles buoyantly with a vinous hint in the middle, this time more like port than sherry. The aura of well-cooked grain reasserts near the end, leaving black coffee across the palate. Hops bitter and malt sweet linger mellifluously at the finish. Artfully balanced and craftily blended, it brings Many together into a wonderfully unified One.  Medium bodied, it impresses the palate tangibly, coating and laying softly before a dry bitter glow lingers.  Like a master juggler keeping several balls in the air effortlessly, this splendid porter nimbly melds multiple elements into a fascinating progression of flavors. With nary a wrong turn, it meanders and winds from one tasty station to another. It's gutsy, but as full as it is, I defy anyone to drink just one, unless that's all you have on hand, which would be a real shame.

Fabulous taste and mouthfeel with a nice little kick of spice at the end from the hops. Mouthfeel I feel is kinda light, which adds to it's drinkability. Drinking just one leads me to want another.

The foamy head lingered for more than half of the glass, leaving a fair amount of lace on the glass. Smells like chocolate, and roasted espresso. The taste is immediately a roasted coffee, followed by a dry chocolate note. There is a modest amount of hop bitterness that seems to be in perfect balance. The carbonation was perfect. I felt that it is just a bit thin, but not enough to discourage. This would be a good session beer. Yes, I would love another, but unfortunately it is the last in the fridge (for now).

There's a definate feel to it, though not as much as I thought there'd be, which makes for a very downable beer. Porter heaven.

73,226,Afterburner,4.62,"Appearance: Dark, but not completely opaque. Dark reddish-brown in color. Moderate tan head, minimal lacing.  Smell: Smells strongly of coffee and hops, with the coffee dominating the profile. The only beer I've ever had that smells more like coffee than this one is a batch of my own homebrew that I make with 1.5 gallons of real, actual coffee. The hops are more floral than piney or citrus.  Taste: Very strong coffee flavor to go with the aroma. If I didn't know better, I'd say this was a coffee beer. Malt sweetness comes through mid-palate, giving it a nice balance. Hops and bitter chocolate notes on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Chewy, lightly carbonated, small bead. Perfect for this style.  Drinkability: Good, but a little heavy.  Overall: I'd heard many good comments about this beer, and was able to give it a whirl thanks to the largesse of a friend in Cleveland.

Very dark brown, almost black with an light tan that was about an inch thick. It laced nicely down the glass.  Smell is toasty at first, but there is a high amount of hop nose as well. Chocolate peeks in a bit, but not as prevalent as the toastiness.  Taste is pretty complex. Nuttiness dominates the malt profile, with a bit of chocolate in the background. A bit of a burnt malt taste as well. Hops don't come through as much in the flavor as they do in the aroma, but they're is a lot of hop character in this porter.  Mouthfeel is a bit disappointing to me. Maybe too much black malt, but there is a bit of an astringency to the beer. It bites the back of your throat. Body is pretty high, and the bitter/sweet ratio is neer perfect.  I think the astringency I got in the mouthfeel turns me away from having multiple ones, but I would definitely enjoy this beer again, as long as I can find it.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,faernt,4.07,"Good lace and a slight green tinge to the blonde head. I guess that's just the hops, Yes? Lots of smell/ taste licorice (no, anise), chocolate which turns into cocoa and then into coffee. That's a nice trick. The tastes soon blend and recall another porter I've enjoyed,(Bell's). The mouthfeel is medium to light compared to beer I've been drinking lately, but I find it very much on style. It's a drinkable session beer",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Bierman9,4.03,"The Fitz has a deep brown color...bordering on chestnut. A tan, 1"" creamy head tops things off, lasts well and sticks nicely. Has dry, roasty, coffee notes in the aroma. Traverses the tongue smoothly, and has a middle of the road, medium body to boot. Roasty and semi-sweet malt hit the palate first. Some chocolate makes a cameo, and the hopping is mild and subdued at the dry finish, being slightly bitter. Kudos to AKSmokedPorter for the tasty sample.  Zum Wohl!!  overall: 4.1 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  706",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,GIVEMEBACKMYSON,4.43,"Beer smells toasty and nutty. It poured a nice 3/4"" head that looks perfect. Then, suddenly, my glass shattered. WTF? Had to be poured into a different pint. Luckily no glass shards in the beer. This is the tastiest porter i've ever had. The roasted, toasty flavor is just as addicting as the nutty undertones. And there is a really nice hop finish, which is really nice to see in a port. The mouthfeel was good, and it would have been better if not for the carbonation that was lost in the re-pour. I rated the score accordingly, which I may adjust when i drink this beauty again, without glass disasters hopefully. Do yourself a favor and get a sixer of this beer.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,cedricwarner,4.65,"Quite black as a porter should be, but with a suprisingly large, creamy, off-white head. Slightly sweet flavors of coffee with cream come through a mild hop bitterness, with only minimal carbonation. A delicious porter, and another reason why Great Lakes is a great brewery.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,soper2000,4.15,"While taking a respite from college for the weekend, I was shocked to find this beer in my dad's fridge mainly because his idea of exotic is Newcastle Brown... Maybe he's getting better... I can only hope. Poured (seemingly out of place) into a Dale Earnhart Jr. pint glass, this beauty was a nice dark brown with a decent sized tan head. Lot's of chocolate aroma in this beer and the taste doesn't disappoint. It has a nice woody malty flavor with some small hints of chocolate and the alcohol gets brought out as the beer reaches room tempature. At room temp. this beer is simply sublime. I will surely pick up some more Great Lakes products when I'm home as the only brew of theirs i can find here is Burning River.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BierReise,4,"Nearly opaque and with a sizable head of mostly loose bubbles. Cookie dough in the aroma with some cocoa notes and roasted malt. Medium bodied and smooth. Great mix of flavors, coffee, roasted malt and a slight hop bitterness. Great Porter and a good session beer at that.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Gueuzedude,4.05,"Pours with a prodigious light brown head. A very dark beer that has deep red hints to it when held up to the light. Aroma is of roast coffee, and lightly sweet, with a strong chocolate malt presence and a bit of astringent roast character, though this is fairly muted. The light sweetness is here in the taste as well, though the dark malt character tends to mute it out. Roast malt notes with hints of coffee and a good chocolate presence round out the middle of this beer. Definitely a great example of a porter, the burnt malt character is fairly muted. Does not have as much of an acrid burnt malt finish as some, it is fairly smooth and drinkable like a good porter should be. The medium body helps the drinkability, though it has so much flavor packed in it I would not recommend pounding this one, nor would I want too as this beer is just too enjoyable. This one is nice and creamy. It has a bit too much burnt malt flavor, if the burnt character was balanced more towards the chocolate side of the spectrum this porter would be perfect.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Skidz,4.38,"Pours out brown, sits down black in the glass with nice, dark red on the sides with a light tan head on top.  Smells nice and roasty with some light chocolate tones and good hoppy aromas bringing you in. Roasted flavors shine through with an interesting woody, even earthy flavors coming through. Good hops all around, finishes bitter and leaves you satisfied.  Medium-full body is nicely presented and makes this all the more enjoyable. An excellent porter that I may soon see added to my regular purchases.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,beerluvr,4.42,"Embarks from the bottle into the glass with a prodigious and long-lasting lightish brown head, settling out atop deep brown liquid with garnet highlights. The nose is pleasantly chocolatey with an undercurrent of coffee wafting upwards. The taste is roasty with some grainy dryness, black coffee, bitter chocolate, with a small amount of fruitiness underneath. Some hoppy bitterness appears after that. Finishes up with a roasty/chocolatey note...extremely drinkable this one is!  Thanks to CRJM for the bottles, another winner!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Rastacouere,4.2,"Opaque, sticky beige head. Roasty aroma, toast, coffee, chocolate, the breakfast of champions to which we add a good touch of hops. The flawless velvety, silky medium body melts the flavours together perfectly. Dark molasses and black chocolate/coffee are balanced by more roastiness than most and a solid bitterness. Remarkably well executed, just as I awaited from past experiences with Great Lakes. An equilibrium in the porters world.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,malty,4.57,"Served from a 12 oz. longneck w/ best before March 16 '04.  Pours a midnight-brown with a tan head that lasts a while with various sized clumps of bubbles sitting atop the virtualy opaque liquid.  Strong scent of bitter dark chocolate, roasted coffee, fresh brownies and a hint of floral fruity hops.  Tastes alot like it smells (see above) with a nice crispness that balances out nicely with the bisquit-like malt. Also a good dose of toast and dark fruity jam flavors as well.  Mouthfeel is airy and silky with a fine carbonation to keep things from getting heavy, being the body is med-full.  For such a robust porter, it never seems to fill me up. High drinkability factor here.  I've had the honor and pleasure of having this from the source back in Oct. '03, and I honestly have not had a finer porter, and I've had my share. And I will say without a doubt this is one of the best bottled porters on the market - a stellar ale indeed!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,bditty187,4.45,"Basically blackish-brown in hue with ruby highlights where the light penetrated the sides of the glass, a finger of beige head tops off the beer in a lovely fashion. The head does fade to about half a finger quickly but the remainder holds excellently. Consequent lacing was webby but very prevalent. As a whole this is a great looking Porter. The potency of the nose is fantastic for a Porter, toasted malts, caramelized sugar, and a hint of roasted almonds, chocolate, and coffee. The individual aromas rarely stand-alone, it is an orgy of smells all focused on a common mission, create an inviting aroma indicative of a Porter. Mission accomplished. The palate is marvelously well rounded; upfront is a bite of citrusy hops that briefly charges ahead of the other flavors, the rest catches-up quickly. Roasted malts impart flavors of coffee and chocolate, toasted wood at the finish. I love the charred taste; it would be a great match with tangy BBQ or hickory-smoked steak, maybe even a gamey seared hen. Medium-full in body, it is rich and filling, a touch creamy, the carbonation is moderate and very soothing. The mouthfeel is good but just above ordinary. Obviously this is one drinkable beer. The aftertaste is big and charred. Awesome! Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is great; I cant say it is that better that Fuller's London Porter! They are both dandies but this bad boy is nearly flawless! Thank you PhantomVodoo!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,abents,4.67,This beer is what porters are meant to be. It pours a dark bown color with a small tan head. The beer smells of carmel and roasted malt. It's got that sweet smell to it and you know it's got the malts. The taste at first is the roasted malt a sweet coating of the mouth warms you up. Then a distinct hoppy taste finishes the drink. Overall a very well made porter one of the best for sure.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,CRJMellor,4.48,"Pours a deep red color with dark brown or black highlights. Two fingered head fades away rather quickly but leaves moderate billowy lace on teh Great Lakes pint glass. Aroma of full roasted malt with chocolate and a hint of coffee. Some earth, wood and a nutty note also detected. Flavor of coffee and chocolate and carmelized sugar. Roasted flavoris very dominant and leads to a hint of charcoal in the middle. Faint taste of nut somewhere along the way also. Medium bitterness towards the finish. Mouthfeel is full and thick on the tongue with a nice sweet aftertaste of chocolate cake or brownie. Drinkability is extremely high, hard to save a few for beerluvr from this six-pack. Classic porter that would stad up to anyhting that the UK would brew. Would sell very well with true porter lovers in the UK.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,masterbruewer,3.91,"Poured a black/dark amber color with a thin light brown head that faded quickly leaving nice lacing.  The small was like burnt oak. A little hint of a plastic-like smell.   Aahh, a nice flavor a little burnt oak taste, a little coffee taste, a bit of a chocolate flavor, a nice blend of tastes with a solid hop background.  The mouthfeel is solid and smooth. Not syrupy or stringy.  A very smooth but flavorful brew. A fine example of a porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jahred,4.1,"I'm a bit puzzled. My bottle says the beer complies with the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516 - but this is brewed in Ohio. And porters, as far as I know, had/have nothing to do with Bavaria. Alas - maybe my beer history/knowledge is lacking.  Anyway, pours an almost-black brown with a thin-to-medium head that quickly disappears. The scent is of roasted malts and esters.  The rich taste is malty and roasty. Not quite sure why, but the thing that comes to mind is that puffed wheat cereal I used to eat as a kid. I don't think there's any wheat in here at all, so maybe my taste buds are deceiving me. Then again, it's a good taste.  The beer tingles a bit on the tongue, and has a very slight, pleasant bitter hoppy finish. As it warms I also taste light chocolate and toffee, but nothing too overwhelming.  Most importantly, this is very easy to drink. It's fairly complex and very tasty.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,TheLongBeachBum,4.63,"Presentation: Standard 12 ounce brown glass bottle. Dark label that has a black background with white lettering. The picture on the label is of storm battered boat called the Edmund Fitzgerald which sank in Lake Superior in 1975. Described on the right hand side of the label as a Porter that combines a complex, roasty aroma with a bittersweet, chocolate-coffee taste and a bold hop presence. Recommended Serving Temperature of 45°F, as well as a listed Strength of 5.8%. Enjoy By Date is Feb. 09 04.  Appearance: Dark brown, deep ruby chestnut body impregnated with inlaid aged mahogany. The body is dark, but held to the light it is possible to see that it is clear, when it even winks with a ruby red hint as it catches the light. Thick smattered cocoa brown lacing sticks to the glass walls as the head that was formed from the initial expanding tan mass settles down to a thick steady looking pillowy 1/2"". A Super Model of the Porter world.  Nose: Smells marvelous, like cracking the foil top open on a fresh jar of roasted coffee mixed with hints of powdered Cocoa and a whiff of Chocolate covered Sponge Cake bring up the rear.  Taste: Strong dark flavors from a Box of Terrys All Gold chocolates and kick-licks like those from a long-standing percolated coffee introduce the beer. The chocolate strata in the beer quickly develops a bitter aspect, akin to a bar of Cadburys Bourneville. Then suddenly, I get a strong floral hoppy twist right in the finish, its almost remarkable how this can break through at such a late stage, like an armor piercing shell somehow it wriggles away from the dark roasted malts and coffee aspects. The hops linger in the finish, and contribute to the bitter astringent ending.  Mouthfeel: Smoky at times, deeply rich and bitter, this is a not a Porter of the vinous Old School, but a welcome addition to the Impressionist era of dark coffee-bitter Porters. High carbonation ensures that the velvety head is experienced with every sip, smooth, rich, expansive and creamy it balances and introduces the bitter coffee body perfectly.  Drinkability: Yet again  a great beer, that only depresses when it gets to the Drinkability marking, for the third time tonight I get to this part of my Review with no beer left!!! Nuff Said!  Overall: A highly enjoyable Porter and a well put together quality beverage.  Well thats 3 Great Lake beers tonight, a real ménage-a-trois of crackers that I would not mind having again. Cheers to BigHuge for delivering another winner from Great Lakes to Long Beach.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,stewart124,4.5,A very dark brown with a nice thick foamy head and lacing. The head fades after a minute but the lacing is still there. Smells of raosted malts. Sweet smelling and strong presence of a chocolate/nutty aroma. The taste is that of a delicious blend of chocolate and coffee. Smooth body and a nice blend of all the flavors including a hint of hops to add to the overall make-up of this brew. Great aftertaste and a very drinkable porter. Another salute goes out to the Great Lakes Brewers!,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,kwalters,4.2,A very memorable porter. I happen to have a GL Edmund Fitzgerald pint glass and made full use of it when sampling this porter. Everything about this beer was above average compared to all the other porters I've had in the past. The best part? It's still distinguishable as a porter instead of a wannabe stout. I'll be back for more!,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,CortexBomb,4.28,"Pours black with a hint of ruby red (just hold it up to the light) with a medium head which lingers atop the brew until it's gone. Smell is delightful as well with lots of chocolate and coffee.  Taste is a good combination with roasty malt, a tad of hops, and chocolate with a nice bitter twang on the after. Beer is also lovely and thick in the mouth with some carbonation to go with. Drinks quite smooth as well.  A quality porter well-deserving of it's reputation!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,beergeek279,4.63,"Served in the 12 oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The color is dark brown, with a foamy beige head that doesn't want to dissipate. The smell is a nice chocolate/coffee. The taste is a very strong coffee/chocolate hit, with a very nice mild hoppiness in it, and a nice bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. Drinkability-wise, I'd be happy with just a case of this in my fridge!!  Finally!! I get this review down after several bottles of this wonderful beer. Despite its dubious origins (Cleveland) and the fact that it gets Gordon Lightfoot stuck in my head, Edmund Fitzgerald may well be the best porter out there, and this is absolutely one I'll have again!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,hustlemuscle,3.83,"I came home from work yesterday not feeling very well at all. I poured a deep, dark glass of the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter, and gosh darn it, I felt better shortly after.  This is not that review. I feel fine. The beer still pours a very dark, almost black brownish color. The head stuck around for a little while, and left a ragged lace as it dissipated. Giving it a swirl brings a complex, somewhat unfriendly bouquet to bear. It smells good, but it ain't a happy smell. Smokey, burnt, and a little coffee.  Stuff tastes good though. A smooth transition from malts at first gulp to a slightly tangy hops touch as it goes down. It sits in the mouth pretty nicely, the tang from the mellow hops giving it a little pop to the tastebuds. A nice beer all around, one I will definatly drink again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Stubbie1,4.33,"The color of this porter is almost jet black. A off whit head did stay for some time and gave way to a very nice ring around the glass. The aroma is of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate present. The taste is nothing but enjoyable. A wave of roasted flavor starts off this porter then followed by hints of a dry hop-""e"" finish. A smooth and creamy feeling in the mouth is noticed. A very nice porter.  Again, thanks to MotoRacer36 for this brew!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BuckeyeNation,4.83,"""The captain wired in he had water comin' in And the good ship and crew was in peril, And later that night when his lights went outta sight Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.""  --Gordon Lightfoot  Deep, dark brown (not quite black) with ruby highlights. The large, pale caramel colored crown has nice retention and gives up lots of sticky lace in the form of concentric rings marching down the pint glass.  The nose is spicy, with plenty of coffee and chocolate. The flavor is dark malty with, again, plenty of coffee and some chocolate. Simply delicious. Edmund Fitzgerald is one of the best (if not THE best) porters in the world. There's some hop bitterness present too, making its presence known on the finish.  The body/mouthfeel is what I've come to know as typical Great Lakes. That is, wonderful. Drinkability is sky high; this one goes down so easily that it's scary. In fact, it goes down about as fast as the Edmund Fitzgerald did.  This is my second Great Lakes beer and I am impressed. No wonder these guys finished so high on the ""Top 50 American Breweries"" list (#3), an honor that is well-deserved. If I was fortunate enough to still live in the GLBC distribution area, I would never be without a few bottles of this world-class porter.  Note: after many more bottles (and most of its serious competition), I still consider Edmund Fitzgerald to be the world's best American porter. 8-5-09.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,proc,4.7,"What an outstanding beer.  Pours out to a dark as midnight sky in the glass with a slight, light brown head. Aroma is that of a wonderfully, roasted malt. The taste is fantastic and sets the gold standard in the porter category. There is such a balance between the roasted malt and the hops that makes this beer eminently drinkable.  If you can get your hands on this one, do so. Rock on Cleveland, you make some fine beer there...",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,stegmakk,3.91,Poured a beautiful solid black with a nice deep tan head that was thick and lasted...Nice lacing too.

73,226,beernbbq,4.5,"Just a great beer. Berry-black with a beige head, slight see thorough capability. Beautiful mint and milk and dark chocolate flavors give way to a clean dry finish.

73,226,GreatPondBrewer,4.45,This beer is quite deserving of the reputation it has and did not dissapoint. Deep dark color with ruby edges showing through and a cafe au lait head with little lacing here and there. The smell was dominated by notes of very sweet raisins and just a hint of day old coffee and roasted malts. Taste was full of sharp bitter coffee and kiln roasted grains but it was mostly a coffee taste that dominated with the nice scratchy porter finish due to a good addition of hops and a balanced carbonation. Well done Great Lakes!,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Beaver13,3.91,"12 oz bottle. Pours an almost opaque dark brown with ruby highlights. It has a creamy tan head that retains well and laces the glass.  The aroma is a mellow, slightly metallic, chocolate with notes of coffee and hops.  The flavor is big on chocolate malts intially, some dark fuits, and a decent hop finish. The mouthfeel is full and creamy. The aftertaste is sticky and slightly metallic bitterness.  Overall, a fine porter. Chocolately with a nice hop balance.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,budsboy,4.1,"It's darker than I expected. Pours nearly opaque with a short-lived carmel-color frothy head. Slight lacing.  Smell is date, malt hints of woodsmoke.  Mmmm. Man, that's good. Great mix of fruit, coffee and pleasant side of chocolate with a nice dry finish. If those Cleveland boys can do better than this, God love 'em.  I went lower on drinkability because, sadly, this beer didn't agree with my system. Two of these and I felt queezy, one and I'm OK. Too damn bad for me.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,tar,4.12,"Pours into the glass a dark black with reddish highlights which are particularly apparent in the light. A thick, foamy, tan to off-white head nicely caps the beer and adds to its already inviting appearance. Smells of roasted malt and coffee. Not unexpectedly the taste is also of roasted malt and coffee, with a bit of bitterness in the finish which nicely balances the flavors. Smooth, medium/full bodied, and highly drinkable. Overall a very good beer which I look forward to having again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Boilermaker88,4.45,"Found this at John's Spirits & Fine Wines in Greenwood, IN. Having developed an affinity for porters and stouts since becoming a BA, and regularly checking the Top 50 list, I knew I had to get a sixer. Presented in a 12oz bottle as depicted, E.F.P. has a black hue with minor ruby shading at the edges. A one inch thick bubbly tan head slowly settles down to a thin cap and leaves behind some small bits of lace. The aroma is quite sweet, of dates and prunes, as well as roasted malt and molasses. The taste is a silky concoction of sweet dark fruits, caramel and toffee, and roasted dark malt. A bittersweet chocolate taste briefly shows itself on the palate before a bitter old coffee taste finishes each sip. The feel is medium-bodied, smooth and silky. I drank three in Indy and brought the rest back on the plane with me. No sharing with family, just hoarded for myself. I'm finishing one of my three even as I complete this review. Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is one of the best porters I've tasted. Incredibly easy to drink and velvety smooth, it's a must-find for any lover of a good porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,yankeeheel,4.42,"Pours a beautiful deep dark mahogany with a wee bit of light peeking through. Smells very choclatey/coffee. Lots of dark malts pervade.  The taste is very nice. You get just a hint of burnt malt followed by a very smooth, almost sweet, wave of chocolate and coffee. Hops show up but are not overly intrusive. Mouthfeel is medium. Thankfully they don't overcarbonate this bad boy. A very balanced porter that ranks tight up there.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,xgrigorix,4.63,"Twelve ounce brown bottle. Best by date printed on label.  Very dark brown, almost black - luminous red highlights shine through. Topped by a huge, pillowy, tan head. The head sticks around for a while, and ever so slowly recedes, leaving some spotty lace behind. Quite a sight to behold.  A complex roast coffee aroma, plays well against a well hopped background. Whiffs of dark chocolate wrap it up, with a promise of whats to come.  Impressively rich. A touch of sweetness leads dark roast espresso, bittersweet chocolate, & a bit of plums. A very subtle touch of smoke leads to a dry finish. Balanced hop bitterness executes on a dime without being overbearing. Dark roast flavours linger. Rich & full bodied, smooth, with moderate carbonation. An amazing accomplishment in brewing.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,euskera,4.26,"Pours out a murky, almost completely opaque brown. Small, nicely defined head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smell is sweet chocolate and coffee overtones. Taste is smooth and silky, reminiscent of a complex stout, its more famous and available cousin. Lots of chocolate presence intermingled with a smoky coffee and raisin bread feel. Very drinkable. A delight to behold, instantly one of my favorite porters..",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,nomad,4.46,"Thank you GreatPondBrewer for this beer!!!  Pours pretty dark with a fluffy foam head made of caverns. It fell very slowly to a sturdy thin-to-medium head, showing plenty of strings of stain off of much lace. A looker.  Smelled of sweet malt with some roasty presence; nascently smoky. Taste was of an ounce of sweetish malt, then came large and full dark malts - tasty. Then was a bittersweet flavor, like a single shot of espresso with a small cube of sugar in it. Great hop flavors emerged toward the end, though they were hard to distinguish from the intense dark body, but softly bitter nonetheless. Good balancing act. Had a long finish of lingering black malt bitterness and hop dryness, almost like black coffee. Never burdensome but became a natural balance to the richness of its body.  Excellent moderate mouthfeel, for me textbook for the style; it really added to the beer as a whole. A rich and drinkable beer, an excellent version of a pub porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,francisweizen,4.33,"This is a very nice dark brown/cola coloured porter with a fluffy, white head. The aromas are of roasted malts, hops, chocolate, and just a hint of caramel (I swear it's in there!) The taste is a chocolate-y explosion of roasted malt flavors, melding harmoniously with the hop flavors in this brew. The mouthfeel is quite medium bodied and the drinkability is excellent for a porter. One of the best porters out there!  F",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,moulefrite,4.42,"Damn good porter that makes me want a rib eye like right now. Deep brown in color with amber tinges on the borders-aromas of cafe au lait, some milk sugar aromas as well. Full bodied and expressive in the mouth with delicious roasted coffee bean flavors and a fine balace between bitter and sweet malt. This beer has a built in affinity for red meat, and one can practically taste a meaty element in the beer itself if one thinks hard enough.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Winter,4.83,"Pours a dark brown with slight ruby highlights. Beautiful long-lasting, creamy light tan head. Sticky lacing trails down the glass. The aroma consists of chocolate malt, roasted coffee and a touch of vanilla. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied. What the aroma alluded to remains true in the flavor. Chocolate, roasted coffee and dark brown sugar all reveal themselves before a dry middle. Cascade hops mark the start of a long rewarding finish. Wow, what an amazingly delicious porter!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

73,226,OldFrothingSlosh,4.6,"Presentation: 12oz. amber bottle. ""Enjoy by"" date of 9/23/03 on the side, along with a blurb about the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Appearance: They say first impressions are lasting impressions. With this beer, I will rememer it for a long time. Poured a beautifuly dark brown, nearly opaque. Just the tiniest bits of light manage to penetrate the depth of this beer. Amazingly thick and persistent coffee-colored head sits proudly atop this beer, like a ship in the ocean.  Smell: Yummy cocktail of chocolate, coffee, and a distinct smoky aroma combine to weave a bit of beer poetry for your senses. Fantastic.  Taste: I will admit that following my failed Polygamy Porter experiment months ago, I was very hesitatant to try any porters for quite a long time (I passed on this one at the April BA get-together at the GLBC). This one has radically changed that opinion. This is a stellar beer. A very tasty mix of coffee and chocolate, with a hoppy bitterness mixed in as well at the end. Top it off with a touch of smoky flavor and you've definitley got yourself a winner.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Very smooth on the palate. Low-medium carbonation.  Drinkability: Wow. I could drink this all day. Pleasing, bitter aftertaste leaves you craving more. Simply incredible.  A huge thanks to AKSmokedPorter for hauling this back from Ohio for me.

73,226,putnam,3.43,"Tasted blind among five peers. (guinness E.S., Sam Smith Taddy, Sinebrychoff and Sierra Nevada) Aromas of roasted coffee, water and skim milk. The palate features a creamy texture with flavors of burnt things. Dry. Weathered, seasoned wood emerges later on the nose. Simple, foursquare flavors of browned starch. Drinkable if forgettable.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,zerk,4.23,"Pours deep chestnut... almost opaque, but a little light passes through. Has a 1/4 inch head that has good retention and leaves behind patches of lace. Aroma is slightly understated, with the presence of chocolate, malt, and some herbal undertones. Flavor is bold and beautiful... combining malty sweetness, some chocolate, coffee and a light herbal bitterness. Has a medium to full body that is smooth and creamy. An top-notch porter in my book!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,marburg,4.42,"A dark, dark brew. Hints of a ruby red gem in the light. Truly porter-like in terms of body -- a beefy, bold flavor packed into a medium to full-bodied brew. A slight burnt aroma with some toffee and chocolate. Bit chocolate flavors for a beer brewed, as far as I know, without an adjunct of the same name. Very slight hop bitterness that blends in with the naturally big malt flavors. This is one of the most drinkable, flavorful, well-balanced porters I can think of. Good stuff.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,TheDM,3.4,This brew poured a medium sized head of medium sized light brown bubbles with a semi-opaque brown body. It has a mild malt aroma with the coffee flavor of a stout. It was smooth yet had a bit too much coffee for a porter. This would be better classified as a stout.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,GeoffRizzo,4.48,"Deep brown hue, tan and well formed foamy head, excellent retention and a fair amount of lacing. Dark roasted malts on the nose. Roasted malts, smokey and licorise flavorings noted off the top. Medium bodied, a touch bitter, pleasantly malty, well balanced, some hops towards the end, with a dry finish. Superb flavoring, great character, superb session porter, defines what a porter should be",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Realale,4.48,"Pours a clear black with plenty of ruby highlights. Fine mocha 1"" head settles to a rocky complete cap leaving nice lacing.  Nose is bready licorice, roast malt and chocolate. A very nice yeasty/fresh baked bread component develops with time.  Medium full in the mouth with absolutely beautiful balance. There are a ton of different dark malt flavors everywhere! Chocolate, bready licorice, bitter roast barley. Great length with a wonderful burnt bitterness to it. Finish is very dry, which leads me to keep reaching for another!  Definitely a fine session porter, and a refreshing change from those that are too heavy on the maltiness, over-hopped, or too sweet.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,MJR,4.37,"Appearance: Pours a deep, dark brown with some red highlights. Above it's clear body, forms a creamy tan head. It quickly shrinks down to a small cap and leaves a bit of lace.  Smell: The aroma is full of roasted barley and coffee. I detect a bit of chocolate, but it's a distant second. There's a faint hop aroma present as well.  Taste: Bittersweet, with a huge shot of roasted malts and coffee. Once it opens up, some chocolate and burnt caramel are noticable. There's a good, firm bitterness that gets stronger towards the end, where a Cascade hop flavor washes it all down. Finishes dry, roasted, and bitter.  Mouthfeel: This is this beer's only weak point: it's a bit too thin. I'll be the first to admit that I like my porters thick and chewy, so I'd like to see some more residual sugars in the body. The finish is quite nice though, as it's nice and dry.  Drinkability: This is a damn good porter, but I can't help but wish the body was a bit thicker. None-the-less, I could put back a few of these anytime.  Many thanks to 'Realale' for lugging this brew back from Michigan for me!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,granger10,4.23,This beer has a very blunt chocolate/coffee taste on the front. A roasted flavor accompanies the mix but its not nuts. The hops are definitely there and save this beer from being too sweet and then they make this beer what it is- A truly great porter! It finishes dry and sweet with more roasted flavors. Very dark and pretty thick. Hats off to great lakes.,Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Shiloh,4.05,"A very nice porter. Poured a deep black with some serious rubylike hi-lites. Nutty coffee like aroma with full body. Smooth, very palatable going down. Impressive. Carbonation was light as was the head. Not a fan of this style....but will revisit. Recomended!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,steelreign,4.37,"Wow. Outstanding ruby dark brown pour really gets my attention. The off white thick head furthers my intrigue, offering caramel, raisins, malt, chocolate, roasted everything....truly a bevy of wonderful aromas.  Taste: well, I am impressed. Somehow, Great Lakes has managed to create a beer that tastes so connected to its appearance and aroma, which is rare. All of the notes in the nose appear in the taste, slight bitterness, but fades to a malty sweet goodness quite quickly. VERY full bodied, and the mouthfeel is outstanding. Hops, malt, roasted barley make their way into your senses and do not let go! Truly a shining example of the porter style, and the only drawback (drinkability) was affected by its carbonation level - a little much IMO that detracted from the incredible taste and body. Otherwise, a prototypical example!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Mitchster,4.84,"Brewed with Pale, English Crystal, roasted barley, and chocolate malts. Hopped with Northern Brewer, Kent Goldings, and Cascade hops. The new profile page on the website says it is brewed with Harrington 2-row, Crystal 77, Chocolate malt, and roasted barley, hopped with Northern Brewer, Fuggles, and Cascade.  60 IBU. 5.8% ABV, OG=15P. (new website says 37 IBU)  Clear, nearly black with dark mahogany accents, forming a 3"" thick, whipped light-tan head atop small bubbles following a vigorous pour. Retention is good, and lacing is sparse. Aroma is richly satisfying and distinctly Great Lakes...almonds, black walnuts, vanilla, lots of chocolate, grainy chocolate malts and roasted barley, lots of roasted grains expertly blended with dark coffee, a hint of caramelized sugar and wood, a fruity, yet clean ferment and some nice green, leafy hops. Mouthfeel is velvety soft and smooth with a medium-dense body...a spritzy start tickles the tongue. Absolutely luxurious. Carbonation is moderate. Taste recapitulates the aroma...this means it is very good stuff in my book:) There is a pleasant green, leafy, woody sweetness in the finish. Semi-dry with a lovely mild chalkiness. The carbonation adds a bright beginning. The finish is very nice, with lingering notes of dark coffee and pipe tobacco, some earthy bitterness, and a very faint residual sweetness 30 seconds after the finish. No notable off-flavors, and alcohol is not perceptable.  Expertly balanced, and consistently awesome. This is excellent stuff. Since Bell's has been so inconsistent, the once awesome Bell's Porter that I so fondly recall has been replaced by the Edmund. This is what Bell's Porter used to taste like back in the day. Heavenly stuff folks. Top porter in it's class, bar none.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,brewdlyhooked13,4.53,"Pours very dark, but not quite opaque. Brownish red color through the glass, good clarity. A thick head following a rough pour and holding at one finger thickness surprisingly well.  Solid coffee aroma on the nose. Incredibly smooth feeling, delivers a wonderful roasty flavor, very soothing, calming, nothing like the waters that took the mighty Fitzgerald down. Nice hop character on the finish, not overstated but enough to contrast the roasted malts on the next mouthful.  IMO, this has perfect mouthfeel for the style, coating without being overly heavy like an imperial. Nice coffee and charcoal aftertaste with hints of bitterness as the mouth dries out a bit, very satisfying overall.  My kinda session beer, Gordon Lightfoot would be proud!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,jcalabre,4,"Originally sampled on 10 November 2002. This beauty has a roasted caramel aroma; a dark brown color w/ a two finger tan head.

73,226,feloniousmonk,4.23,"Appearance: solid brown body, with a lush, flowing head of tannish foam atop, though in a hurry to settle down. Aroma: mild at first, creamy, with hints of nuts, vanilla, caramel, with slowly the better earmarks of a good porter emerging, and we're getting the roasted coffee, getting roastier and bitterer as we go, and as it unfurls we can detect things weightier, headier, more thick and viscous: molasses, syrup, motor oil. On first sip and gulp, I was magically lifted up and removed from the mundane and the everyday. Mouth-filling, rich, powerful, flavorful, and just plain FULL! Nothing loose or limpid here! Bitterness is just so, and soon turns to the sweet. I don't know what exactly to liken it to, but it seems to tread a middle ground: no too bitter, not to smooth, juuust right! One caveat: the carbonation feels a bit too cola-like, and that ain't good, in my book. Finish is fine and long-lasting, settles in to occupy the mouth and endear itself to all the senses. However, a certain heft is lacking in overall body and character, that I would expect, nay demand, out of any true Baltic porter. Needs more Oooom-pa-pa-mow,mow!, if you follow. Still an excellent porter, and one which I'd greatly appreciate more, if it were available in my environs.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,stirgy,4.65,"This beer poured a dark coffee brown, almost black color. It was topped off with a creamy light brown head. Immediately was overwhelmed by the rich roasted coffee and bitter chocolate aromas. Smells great. The taste is toasted and roasty, bitter, spicy and dry. Very drinkable. Hop bitterness is there, too along with some caramel. All the flavors intensify as the the beer warms up. An excellent beer for a rainy night or anytime.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,tavernjef,4.13,"I'm a lover of the great lake Gitche Gummi ( Lake Superior) and the whole Edmund Fitzgerald legacy, unfortunately this beer comes up short of port in its story as well. Color is very dark brown with deep dark ruby highlights, dark as the waves that split the Fitz. Pencil width high head of tannish tight creamy foam, steady and calm, leaving port steady as she goes, no ship sinks in this stuff. Spotty stringy lace sticking some and some losing hold and sinking into the darkness from which it came. Aroma is crispy, roasty, slightly sweet and dark burntness of malts and a faint noteable hop. Taste sails along in roastyness, smooth at first, then the waves begin to pick up with sweet tinglyness, darkening up, a surge of bitterness through hops and ends into a light lingering smokey feel, woody, coffeeish finish. Moderately dry port to starboard, through and through. Feel is full and heavy, proudly bittering dry right on into the depths of finishing. Much like the ship, this beer sets sail but sadly never ports again. A bit disappointed in this porter being a fan of the great lake and the story of the Fitz. Was hoping for more weight and robustness. Still a very decent porter and won't turn it down for nothing.

There is a bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is a roasted coffee smell, very pleasant. The taste is full of coffee, toffee, and caramel. There are a good amount of hops to balance out these flavors. The mouthfeel is very heavy and thick. At only 5.8%, this is a very drinkable and enjoyable porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

This porter is inky black with a creamy tan head that reduces but is everpresent, moderate lacing in the glass throughout the drinking session.  The aroma is primarily chocolate and mocha with a nice sourness in the backdrop, very pleasing and a signal for what is to come.  The taste is exceptional: malty, thick, chocolately, mocha-infused, with roasted notes balancing any overt sweetness. The hops are present, but take a supporting role. Wow, I could drink this all night long.  A chewy and creamy body complements the well-balanced flavor that this fantastic porter provides. This beer deserves all the accolades it receives. It is now firmly ensconced in my private top beer list.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,BigHead,4.32,"Ah, the Eddie Fitz, the legend and the mystery. Lost in the dark waters of the Great Lakes, the ship's lore has always intrigued me and so has this beer.  A dark porter with a nice thin head. Coffee and chocolate dominate the aroma of sweet maltiness. Smooth with the roasted coffee flavor and the chocolate feels like it melts around your tongue. Some nuttiness on the back of the mouth with a slight acidic sensation of coffee on the roof of my mouth. The hops do eventually present some bite after the first few initial sips. It's smooth with more carbonation than I expected. A very good beer, smooth and great flavor.  A nice representation of the Fitzgerald!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,fattyre,4.2,This beer pours a very slightly hazy very dark brownish red with a large dark tan head. The mouthfeel shows a slight firmness. The smell is sweet smoke with a faint coffee aroma.

73,226,cretemixer,4.35,"Deep, dark brown with a dense honey oak colored head. It fades after some time to a thin layer, leaving a clingy lace collar. Toasted malt aroma, chocolaty and nutty. The hop aroma is taking a backseat to the malty goodness of this beer. Taste is of chocolate, weak coffee notes, and a nutty flavor too. The bitterness rounds out this beer well and gives it a nice balance. Medium-full body and an almost perfect carbonation level combined with the taste, make for one very drinkable beer. Great Lakes does it again.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Toasted grain lots of malt and to me a sweet black walnut aroma noticed, a fine sniffer at any rate. At the front sweet, the top slender in its feel to the palate, finish has a splendid hop spiciness, the carbonation mild, with the aftertaste droughty and lingering, a fine porter.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The color is very dark, a deep brown with reddish tints, and the head, though small, was creamy and dark tan. This brew is all about taste. My best adjective for this is complex; the flavors are well balanced, but there are a multitude of impressions from a single gulp. Coffee, chocolate, bit of hoppiness; did I miss nutty?

The head settles out nice and thick just the way I like it expressing a milk chocolate color, that is resiliant and almost everlasting. Clings to the glass like it's holding on for dear life, this beer leaves an amazing lace on my glass. Containing hints of chocolate, coffee, and other dark roasts this porter has it all. You realize that the aroma and appearance isn't all this beer is made of, the taste is built up to so nicely that this beer has already been a journey of the senses. Initially the this beer dances around the sweet tooth in my mouth, to balance out in the swallow to a nice smooth dryness that soothes and nurtures my senses. This beer on tap is dangerously drinkable, due to the fact that not only can I drink alot of it, but it is like liquid crack without the negative effects. Bottom Line: Great Lakes = Great Beer!!!",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

It's so well-balanced and smooth.  Mouthfeel: So enjoyably smooth and creamy with a perfect amount of carbonation.  This is the best porter I have had to date.

Some reddish, mohagony hue in head along the side of the glass and beer itself. Aroma most notably presents heavily roasted malt (nutty) and coffee scents. Awesome flavor. Nutty, heavily roasted malt and coffee flavors. Fairly neutral, meaning not overly sweet or bitter. Exceptionally well balanced. Hops show in the end, but finishes very cleanly. Excellent, creamy mouthfeel. Exceptional drinkability for a beer of this magnitude. Overall, still my favorite porter.

Close to 1/2 an inch of tawny tan and creamy foam that laces pretty nicely. A little acidity to the aroma. Flavor is slightly smokey and nicely malty, a sense of sweetened coffee with a squirt of lemon and a finish of nice hop and dark roasted malt bitterness.

The perfect blend of roasted notes, chocolate, coffee and burnt malt on the nose. The palate picks up all of the aforementioned aroma notes (roast, chocolate, coffee and burnt malt) and also a little bit of licorice and anise thrown into the mix.

Thank you PhantomVoodoo for sharing the wealth.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,johnrobe,4.3,"This is another well crafted brew from Great Lakes and a textbook porter. The color is just shy of black...light is just barely able to escape its surface. It sports a tan colored head that reduces to just a cap but leaves a fair bit of lace. The aroma is of dark roasted malt, molasses, and a whisp of sourness (the kind which is much more pronounced in Sierra Nevada Porter, I believe due to a healthy hop presence wafting through the dark roasted malt). This brew is chock full of dark roasted malt flavor (reminds me of a dry irish stout, but with a lighter mouthfeel)...some dark roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, plus a hint of citric hops. There's just enough sweetness to take the edge off the bitterness without competing for your attention. A very tasty brew.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

The body is a very dark brown - not quite opaque as mahogany highlights can be seen at the base and rim of the glass - but basically ""black"". The head eventually drops to just a collar but leaves some nice lace. The aroma is nicely fruity, chocolatey and coffee-ish - almost candyish (chocolate covered cherry?). Very welcoming! The body is firm with a very fine and gentle carbonation that's creamy in the mouth. The flavor starts with sweet and fruity notes amongst a deep roastiness, becomes more chocolatey as it crosses the palate and into the swallow, and then unleashes an intense coffee character that includes flavor as well as roastiness and bitterness. Amazingly, some citrusy hop flavor appears out of nowhere and lingers along with a mocha character and some bitterness in a long finish. Really well balanced, very drinkable, and complex. I was quite impressed with this beer. Well worth seeking out.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94

Beautiful mocha aroma. Roasted and slightly sweet. Entracing. Very mocha like in the mouth as well. Moderately heavy roastedness up front. Begins to fade as a subtle chocolate sweetness seeps in. A little dusty earthiness...but in the most spendid way. A nice swift cascade kick in the end to tie this one up. Powerfully hopped, but not overwhelming. Fantastically balance and rock solid, as all Great Lakes products seem to be. Very smooth and sensuous on the palate. Full bodied, but thins just slightly in the finish.

That being said, this is a very good beer.(jtw5877 is from Canton, so he's ok.) Deep black color, amber hues. Tan foamy rich head, covered the beer to the bottom, laced nicely. Smells were sweet roasted malt, slight roasted bitterness. Taste was smooth sublte hops, very slight, and a sweet roasted chocolate backbone. Very smooth, lightly carbonated. Rich and creamy feel.

Dark and delicious, a superior porter. GLBC always comes through. I'd recommend this to anybody who likes porters.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
73,226,Jason,4.38,"Presentation: 12oz brown with a drink before date clearly marked.  Appearance: Black with burnt garnet hues ... dense rocky lace crawls all over the glass.  Smell: Caramelized sugar and rich chocolate in the nose.  Taste: Medium to full in body with a fat chewy malty mouth feel up front, a rich undertone of caramel fills a creamed coffee / chocolate flavour. Hop bitterness leaves a tingle on the tongue and helps to quell the sweetness. More hop character comes though and leaves a leafy / faded citrus taste. There is an almost brownie dry finish to the brew ... yum!  Notes: The brewers of GLBC can not do any wrong, an eye-filling brew. This is the proper way to craft a traditional porter ... drink and learn.",Great Lakes Brewing Co.,"Ohio, United States",American Porter,94
