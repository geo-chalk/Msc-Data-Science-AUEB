140,1904,TheYeasticandoo,3.85,"Accidental Discovery: While busy in my workshop, i mistakenly poured Allagash White into a half full red solo cup of SN Celebration. It was fantastic! Blended together nicely and reminded me of Orval (Belgian Trappist Pale Ale). So, SN Celebration + Allagash White = Orval clone? Try it…",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,UWDAWG,3.74,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a tulip glass.  Look- Deep amber, very hazy, plentiful visible particulate, medium tan frothy head, above average head retention, average lacing.  Smell- Biscuit, pine, faint grapefruit, medium strength of scent.  Taste- Biscuit, pine, grapefruit, medium strength of flavor.  Feel- Between medium and full body, highly creamy, moderately astringent, high bitterness, average carbonation.  Overall- Look was deep amber with a high amount of haziness and well above average head retention. Bouquet was predominantly biscuit with some pine and citrus. Taste was also dominated by malt with understated pine and grapefruit. Feel was highly creamy with between medium and full body, but moderate astringency. Overall this West Coast IPA was much too malt forward for my liking and with an ABV of just 6.8% it was unnecessary.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Mr3dPHD,5,"This is a perfect example of an old school American IPA. I look forward to it every year and lament it's passing at the end of each winter season. Steeped with history, it's classic use of chinook, cascade, and centennial is unmatched, bringing the bright piney citrus flavor you come to expect from the west coast.  If you like American IPAs, this is one you should be required by law to try. Pick one up if it's available! You'll be so happy you did.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,SuperPie,4.29,"Celebration A: 3.75 - Poured from 12oz can into shaker pint. Poured clear with dregs at the end giving a slight haze. amber brown with tannish, cream colored cap of foam. Head filled the top of the glass. Very nice lacing sticking to the glass throughout the session.  S: 4 - grapefruit, citrus, and pine. Sweetness from the crystal malts is present with a caramel aroma. Slight toffee to the smell, too.  T: 4.5 - Begins with an interplay of a candy like sweetness with herbal-orange flavor that rounds itself out with bitterness from the hop resins. mineral quality on the back end that is refreshing and announces the bitterness. Finish is not overly dry. Bitterness lingers - the “stickiness” from the hops is pleasant and never overwhelming.  F: 4 - medium to full bodied. Carbonation was soft and pleasant.  O: 4.5 - in my mind, this is THE example of how crystal malts in an IPA can serve to produce a drink that is balanced with the bitterness and flavor of hops. Crazy to call an IPA balanced - but Sierra Nevada knows a thing or two on this. The fresh hop flavor of the classic Centennial and Cascade varieties in this beer is unmatched.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,buzzard13,4.75,This is one of my favorite beers. Kind of happy that it’s a seasonal so I don’t get burned out on it. The favor and feel is just outstanding. Wonderful initial flavor and finish.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dano213,4.19,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a six pack for $10.99 as best I can remember. Canned on 10/7/22, so this is almost three months old.  Look: Pours an essentially clear medium amber color. The khaki-colored head was thick upon pouring, then reduced to a thin layer and left rocky bubbles behind.  Smell: Lots of pine and grapefruit on the nose along with a bit of spice. The caramel malt is also present in a restrained way. There's also a fruit sweetness up front that is hard to place but it kind of reminds me of cranberry or pomegranate, almost cherry. A bit medicinal on the finish. The nose smells very nice and inviting.  Taste: It is indeed very hoppy, wow. It must have been a while since I have had this beer. I usually pick it up every year, but I may have somehow missed it last year. Up front, that fruity sweetness comes through along with some caramel malt, which is quickly overtaken by hops on the back end. The finish lingers long and has tons of grapefruit pith and pine resin along with woody notes. Even with the high bitterness, this beer is extremely tasty and drinkable. It's really refreshing too.  Feel: Very nice chewy mouthfeel. The beer is also very clean and refreshing.  Overall: This is one of the best seasonal IPAs around. It's not easy to find fresh hop beers, and the distribution and availability of this beer is quite remarkable. Pretty awesome that Sierra Nevada has been brewing this beer for 40 years now! I hope that they will continue to also bottle this beer, however I only saw it in cans this year.  From the website: Malts - Caramelized malts, Two-row Pale Hops - Cascade, Centennial, Chinook Yeast - Ale Yeast",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,crm871,3.88,"Look: Pours a deep red with a thick, frothy white head.  Smell: This one just radiates hops and floral aromas. Lots of pine.  Taste: Pine, malts, floral patterns on the back as it goes down. Bitter bite to it.  Feel: Lighter than I expected and I found this very easy to drink.  Overall: I think this probably gets more hype than it deserves purely because it’s seasonal, but it’s still a really good beer that can stand on its own. Pick this up for the holidays.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Pours a clear copper with nice white head.  Dry, vegetal, hop resin. Leah gets pine.  Apparently the hype is what sells this beer because it's not particular special or noteworthy.   Starts with an ever so slight hint of sweetness followed by a huge, dry, mouthful of bitter grapefruit rind.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,AZgman,3.87,"I was finally able to find some 2022 Celebration at a local store. Based on the reviews of others, I had pretty high hopes.

140,1904,cosmicoutershel333,4.04,"Honestly, this is alllllmost too hoppy for me but the more I drink it (grabbed a sixer) the more delightful I find it. Definitely only a once-a-year kinda beer but if you can stomach the robust hoppiness you’ll find that this pungent IPA is actually prime for relaxing on a chilly eve with some pizza and a good flick (or some random YouTube). Not a regular go-to, I’d say, but something I can definitely enjoy from time to time. Celebration is right!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,NevadaBill,4.33,"Poured from a 12oz bottle, bought fresh from Costco (case). This is a winner. It is hopped real well, and does not deteriorate in the bottle as fast as other ""fresh hop"" beers tend to do. I've had a couple cases of them now, over the past month or two, and each bottle is fresh. I am kind of a Sierra Nevada homer, actually. I love their ""Sierra Nevada"" flavor that they kind of put in to many of their beers. It has a bitter front and, and a bitter finish which sticks around a while. Love that. The Cascade hops are prominent, and the Centennial is there too, but not so much. It might have another hop in it too. This might become my favorite Winter beer if they keep making it annually. I will buy an extra case and see how long it cellars before it loses those nice hops. What a great little beer. I want to eat sausages and fresh baked pretzels when I drink this!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,DrOfGolf,4.31,Amazing experience and this beer is the best every year that Sierra Nevada brews and releases it to the beer drinking public. You can't go wrong buying this one. Enjoy the experience.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JesseJames81,4.13,"Appearance: Pours a deep reddish amber color, with a thick, frothy white foam head. Retains well and leaves behind some nice and sticky lacing  Aroma: Citrus and floral hops. Caramel malts. Bready and a little bit of pine.  Taste: Carmel malts up front. Followed by some bitter citrus peel and spicy herbal hops in the middle. The bitterness lingers in the finish for a little bit, but not too long.  Overall: This is a very solid brew from a classic craft brew company. Can't go wrong with Sierra Nevada. This one has a West Coast IPA vibe with its own unique touch. Well done.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Beecham,4.61,"Fresh hop - Green, grassy hop profile, leading to bucketfuls of bitter citrus, pine resin freshness, earthy spice, toasted nuts, along with a huge underpinning of caramel and toffee malt, bringing a perfectly balanced sweetness. Pretty damn outstanding.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,hoppity,4.34,"Six pack of cans.  The color of this edition really struck me. It's a beautiful darkish, yet bright copper color that looks great in a german pilsner snifter type .4L glass. (Binding Beer glass.)  The smell and taste were both a little more subdued than I expected at first, when it was just out of the fridge. Things opened up as it sat. It didn't sit very long though because it's delicious. Earthy maltiness balanced oh-so-well with hop characteristics. It's another winner from Sierra Nevada, a brand I've been enjoying for 40 years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MadMadMike,4.25,"2022 - Cold 12 ounce can poured into a ‘can glass’. Bold foamy head tops this copper colored beauty, it laced its way down as I sipped. Smells piney, cereal, toffee, is that fruit cocktail in there? Tastes great. Rich and bold, balanced and pine, fruit but not fruity. Good bitterness! Full attention getting feel, this is an expressive beer. Overall, this kickoff to the Holidaze is excellent on all levels!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BloodSoakedAleMug,3.89,"2022 re-review.  Look: Pours a rusty orange color with a billowing three finger head of off white foam. Laces the glass well with good head retention. Very pretty looking in the glass.  Aroma: Nose of sweet caramel and granola. Spicy pine sap with grapefruit and lemon rind. A touch of blueberry, honey and old leather polish.  Taste: Very pleasant. Upfront sweet toffee and cinnamon / granola with notes of toasted nuts. Hints of mildly acidic pine resin complemented by big notes of savory caramel & honey. Midpalate there is a spicy pine and grapefruit oil note followed by a prolonged and dry aftertaste of fruit cake.  Feel: Dry, spicy. But still creamy and full bodied. Moderate carbonation with a hearty weight and mouthfeel to it. 7% abv is hidden well, but still somewhat apparent with a pleasant, clean alcoholic nip on the back end of each sip.  Overall: I come back to this beer annually to sort of usher in the holidays / winter weather. Some years it's better than others, I admit I've been disappointed by it in the past but there's something about it this year that's really exceptional. Great value too @ $18 for a 12 pack; which is a steal in NY, as most craft beer tends to be very overpriced. This is a perfect mid-autumn early-winter beer with a citrusy, spicy candy like savory flavor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,nizzle8287,5,"Poured from a can dated 10/13/22, into a pint glass at 52F Appearance is between copper and apricot in color, with a booming 3 finger head that leaves lots of nice lacing. Smell is slight citrus with a piney sharpness. Resinous hop glory. Faint bread almost eclipsed by hops. Taste is so nice and follows the nose to a T. Pine needles and blood oranges backed up by a smooth and well-blended malty backbone. Mouth feel is expansive and delicious. Perfect carbonation; a little on the high side, but just right to make all those flavors bounce around and create this awesome bouquet of fresh hops and caramelized malts. Bitterness lasts on the palette for a long time. ABV exists, but is covered mostly by the hop IBUs. Overall, spectacular brew, and will buy again for sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kflorence,4.42,"Canned on date: 10/13/2022  Pours a crystal clear, cherry-amber in color with hints of copper. A half inch of off-white foam sits on top for a few minutes before dissipating to a thin layer of lacing which lines the glass as you drink. Has the look of a more balanced IPA that's perfect for fall drinking.  Honey, melon, pine and caramel malts are the predominant notes on the nose right after the pour. As it warms, the aroma becomes a bit more roasty/grainy. It smells very fresh.  Taste follows the nose well, while offering additional complexity. Getting more citrus on the tongue, especially of the grapefruit variety. Some earthy/herbal notes in there as well, especially towards the finish. The hops really shine here, but the roasted maltiness keeps it from becoming overly bitter. Finishes quite bitter and fairly dry with grapefruit rind which lingers on the tongue. Alcohol is masked quite nicely.  Medium bodied on the tongue with zesty carbonation and solid chewiness. An almost perfect mouthfeel, but most assuredly a palate wrecker as the hops coat and linger on the tongue. My stomach also tells me I probably shouldn't have more than two of these.  Overall this one lives up to the hype. I'm sure I had this at some point in the past, but never got around to reviewing it until now. This is definitely fresh and complex with an ""old school"" hop/malt profile, harkening back to my college days when I was first getting into IPAs -- the classic pine/citrus mix with ample maltiness to add some balance. A great IPA for the fall and winter, I can see why this is a staple for so many hop lovers. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Aggressive bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, drying, very stringent  Overall: Reviewing vs style. Solid American IPA. Hop forward in aroma and flavor. Citrus fruit, herbal/spiciness and resinous. Highly bitter. It checks every box for a standout American IPA. On a personal level, I did not enjoy this. Aromas were not as big as I expected. It has a very sticky, aggressive bitterness & astringency, which I do not enjoy because it coats the tongue, hiding the other beer flavors and reduces drinkability. Does not invite you to have that second pint. That being stated, the people that love this beer love it for the exact same reasons. Bottom line, if you enjoy highly bitter, aromatic IPAs, this is an excellent example.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: Mostly hop bitterness, maybe a little malt sweetness F: This year's edition is smooth and very crushable.

140,1904,JZH1000,4,"Poured from a 12oz can On the pour the color is dark for an IPA, almost red, but still in the amber range decent head looks frothy with some bigger bubbles, fair retention. Very light lacing that doesnt love to stick around.  The smell hits as soon as you start pouring. Strong piny hops are strong in this one, definitely a wesr coast/traditional american feel on the nose. Malt is largely overshadowed in the smell, but on the back there is a hint of resinous citrus.  Taste is very strong and a classic bitter american IPA but the hop nuance still shines through beyond the bitter. The malt is much more present in flavor and imparts an amber malty sweetness carrying it along nicely. As a malt head myself I appreciate that. The alcohol is detectable bit not in a boozy way per se, more in addition to the hoppy bitterness. The bitterness does tend to stick around for a bit after a sip.  The feel is quite heavy I must say but it certainly warms you up as it should, as a winter seasonal. I can see this being a favorite for the ipa crowd for sure.  Overall a bit hoopy for my taste but I could see that coming, however the hop flavors are of very high quality and the piny hops are a nice touch for an interesting take on seasonal holiday beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

F: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is a bit sticky followed by bitter hop. It calls for a second sip.  O: Old school IPA. Great citrus-forward hop profile with a solid malt body.

Not much smell through the head, but as head subsides slowly, I get good grassy fresh hop aroma. Tastes real good, with a blossoming aftertaste revealing gentle bitter hanging on nicely and a mouth-watering need for more.

140,1904,Spike,4.25,"12oz can. A rich and robust IPA with a solid malt backbone. Fresh, leafy hops add bitterness. This is exactly how I see the American style of IPA starting out, as a New World interpretation of the original English IPA. There’s resin in the background but it’s not an all-out hop bomb. Instead, the hops offer stewed tea astringency with the roasted malt playing an equal role. Looks great as well. Good stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BillAfromSoCal,4.21,"12 oz can with date of 10/15/21 bought off a room temp shelf on 11/9, refrigerated and consumed same day from a tulip glass. Pours a medium to dark amber with tight head at least 2 fingers high. It recedes to leave scattered islands of thin foam, a ring of foam, and lots of sticky lacing. Pine dominates the smell and flavor, supplemented by the merest hint of citrus rind and possibly some spice(?), even though they maker claims no spice. A lot of hop bitterness; more than my personal preference but perhaps a good example of the hoppier end of the WC IPA style, therefore I am not penalizing the score since this is probably a good example of the style",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,MackT,3.79,"12 oz. can, 5 weeks old. Slightly cloudy amber color. Smell is nothing distinctive, pleasant , non offensive. Taste is sweet malty, piney hops, dry with faint herbs.

It was out of place in the cooler by itself I asked how much she said 9 bucks I hoped that wasn’t skunked but the opportunity cost was less than how intrigued I was by how the aging would’ve tasted. Well definitely not skunked to my delight hard for me to say anything bad other than not really my style but each one tasted better and that’s sort of insult.

(4.25)  Aroma: Mild on the aroma of orange/tangerine soap citrus, some spice, and pine soap. As it warms faint cherry and nutmeg. Deep pine and sudsy before the caramel and spice come through. Dark sudsy pine and red grapefruit bath soap. (3.50)  Flavor: Vague flavors of blood orange citrus & grapefruit, nectar, spiced, piney caramel, toffee, and an undercoating of deep, wet pine. Then the undercoat of deep woodsy pine bitterness comes back around. Moderately bitter wood on the finish. Malty with spicy caramel with a woodsy/pine finish. (3.75)  Feel: Medium to heavier bodied. Moderate carbonation, but no match for the huge malt body and bitterness. Definitely resinous. Leaves a sweet, but bitter and spicy finish on the palate. (4.00)  Compared to Torpedo: Very similar and nearly indistinguishable. More spicy caramel, red fruit, and malt body. Less hop flavors, but more bitterness. Slightly heavier bodied and resinous. Sweeter as well.  to Surly's Furious: Similar color. Less aroma. Less hoppy and piney. Much more smooth with dank nectar sweetness without the bitter piney finish. Yet similar body and sweetness overall. 12/7/20: Pours a slightly darker color. More spiced caramel malt sweetness. Less grapefruit, pine, pinecone bitterness and flavor. Heavier and sweeter with less bitterness.  to Stone's Arrogant Bastard Ale 2020: Nearly identical beers. Both lack flavor and aroma. More pine, nectar aroma and flavor here. Less bitterness overall. 1/2021: Pours a lighter and clearer oranger color. Milder aromas/flavors. More pine soap, spiced caramel, orange.

Overall: Deep citrus, spiced caramel, and pine. Some red grapefruit, but mostly malts including SPICY PINE & CARAMEL MALT flavors. (But gets more resinous orange/caramel and less spiced pine as it ages) The hop flavors are subdued, but not the bitterness. What gives this beer away is the signature Sierra Nevada pine flavor upfront followed by the signature Sierra Nevada caramel malts that they use.

The pine carries through on the initial taste but soon gives way to malty sweetness.  It's foamy and smooth with a bitter aftertaste that leaves your mouth dry and wanting more.

Until then it's a copper colored brew, with the afore mentioned copious head which is leaving a tremendously thick layer of glass lacing. It has a nice aroma of a good hop-malt combination. Time for the taste test: it's wonderful as it begins light on both hops and malts, then both emerge simultaneously. This is as earthy malt pronounced as Victory's Hop Devil and as well hopped. Truly full flavored with roasted malts and complex hop contributions, this is an outstanding AIPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,TheBricenator,4.35,"Look: Semi-clear blood red-tinted orange with a dense off-white head that pillows up and holds well, slowly receding and leaving great lacing behind Aroma: Pine, rose petals, grapefruit-led citrus fruits, unbaked bread dough, floral notes, and dark bready malt Taste: Pine, rose, flowers, and pithy grapefruit rind scream onto the palate at first and set the tone while rich and slightly sweet doughy and bready malt seep into the picture. More floral and citrus hop goodness grab hold and tango with the malt until a crisp hop bite closes it out Mouthfeel: Full bodied – leans towards chewy but stops short, medium-high carbonation, and an evident bite and dryness on the finish Overall: This is outstanding stuff. I love this beer and always have so I’m a total homer for it but it is a very well-made and balanced combo of what I would call half IPA, half hoppy red ale. Old school floral and citrus ‘C’ hops add to the nostalgia of this and a welcome and frequent addition to the beer fridge throughout fall and winter.

140,1904,86sportster883,3.77,"I love the brilliant dark amber color of this beer. The first pour from my 64 oz growler produces a short-lived, off white head that left some lacing. There is no streaming of carbonation from the bottom of the glass, but the beer is not flat. The smell is subdued when at refrigerator coldness, and a caramel malt base dominates. Resiny hop aromas build as the beer warms and the taste follows suit with a toasty malt flavor that is dried by resinous hops. The mouthfeel is medium and the finish leaves a low level pine like bitterness on the palate. There are some citrus and floral hop notes too, but they don’t rise to the forefront. I’m sure this beer is different fresh out of the bottle vs. out of a keg, then to a growler, then to the fridge and eventually to my glass. It’s a smooth, malty ale with just enough hop presence to bring it all together and let you know you’re drinking an IPA. It’s a very good beer, and I would choose this beer over most winter holiday seasonal beer offerings, but I wouldn’t choose it often over other IPAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Notes of dark bread, fresh cut pine, general citrus, candied peach, and caramel malt  The front end of the sip is loaded with crisp malt and fresh citrus to cut through it. The swallow brings sharp pine, bready malt, brown sugar, and a touch of pepper  A hefty medium body combines with very mild carbonation for a very smooth drinking beer.

Mouthfeel is medium and it’s not a monster at 6.8 but warms your innards and is very satisfying. Still my favorite holiday IPA.

Not in your face aromatic (not comparing to some NEIPA, more what I recall from a SNPA/Torpedo/etc.) but perhaps that’s the deal with Celebration as this is my first  T: follows the nose very well - would say i get the malty sweetness at first, but followed very closely by those great hop flavors. Has this bourbon flavor to it almost, get this toffee/caramel note from the malt that flows beautifully into that citrusy grapefruit flavor and eventually piney bitterness.

140,1904,mschrei,4.59,"I have been drinking this one for years, and I cannot believe I have never rated it until tonight. It’s almost 4 months old, and you’d think a fresh hop beer at that age would be quite faded, but I think it’s still pretty spot on and hasn’t lost much. A very red/tan color with frothy head and lacing. Smell is piney and mildly citrusy, as is the taste, with a bit of maltiness. Medium body, sharp, crisp, mouth watering, juicy, slight booze presence. What’s really great is it’s amazing year in and year out, which says something about their hops. I really love this beer. I’ll try to remember to revisit my rating with my first one of 2020’s edition to see what i think of it fresher.  2020 note: I’m drinking my third of this year, bumped the taste up from 4.25 to 4.75 and thus affected the entire rating. It’s a classic IPA in this day and age when everything has to be happier, juicier, and more in your face. It’s got that old West Coast bitterness that meshes well with the raw fresh hop taste so well. I find myself buying a lot of this every year, and it NEVER disappoints.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Wattie83,4.24,"Pours a nice deep, rich amber with a big, sticky ivory head that clings to the glass. Awesome lacing. Looks beautiful in the glass. Strong smell of pine, resin, sweet caramel. Taste is hop forward, but enough malt to keep it balanced. A nice bitter finish that keeps this in the old school west coast IPA family. It's really a nice finish. Sticky but in a good way. It's a medium bodied brew with nice carbonation that is evident enough to keep hold everything together, but not overly done. Overall: I tried this beer when I was new to craft beer and didn't appreciate it. Now, I really enjoy it. It's a ""comfort beer"" given its history and longevity; a definite throwback to IPA's of old. I really enjoyed it this year through the holiday season and into the winter.

140,1904,MaltsOfGlory,3.47,"12oz bottle, bottled a month ago  Pours three fingers of just off white head into my can-style glass, quickly swells to nearly 2 fingers over the rim, somehow not pouring over. Very creamy; pillowy would be an understatement. Body is a dark burnt orange, nearly brown. Medium amount of bubbles coming up. Looks very good so far, albeit one of the most peculiar heads, especially given the normal amount of nucleation.  While hard to stick my nose in the glass, the aroma does give off plenty off pine, earthy and spicy hops, light notes of caramel and toffee. A really nice aroma, balanced, quite full, and somewhat complex. It smells like a brew day, and I’m totally ok with that.  Hop flavor is pretty lackluster, not giving off much off any distinct characters. Malts have a little more, some caramel shines through. Falls off pretty hard entirely towards the end and finishes watery, maybe a tad metallicy as well. Not awful, but very flavorless.  Mouthfeel was ok. Carbonation for some reason blew up the head of this beer, in turn coming out of solution very fast, settling at not flat, but lower than normal carbonation. This is not a nucleating glass, and there weren’t a lot of bubbles, but it’s lack of carbonation very evident non the less. Pretty wet body. Bitterness is here but doesn’t shine that bright. Overall pretty watery.  Drinkability is ok I suppose.  Appearance turned out great, thick lacing, great head.  I have to start scratching my head here, am I drinking beer too slow? No matter the glass it seems, a lot of recent beers lose their carbonation. Must be a coincidence. Anyways, this was watery, somewhat flat, flavor disappeared, average beer to say the least. I’m confidant this is better out of the bottle.

140,1904,SmokySignals,4.63,"For the holiday weekend 2019, bottled on 11/01/19, poured into ipa glass: Rich deep golden body and a picture perfect dense shiny 3 finger head that lasts respectably and leaves good lacing. Powerful fresh hop and malt scents are impeccable and unmistakably Sierra Nevada. Their best offering IMO. Tastes exactly as I'd hoped and expected from the great nose, and with that full maltiness balancing all that fresh bitter. Great finish, not harsh or anything. This may be my favorite ipa to date! Caramel richness, piney tartness...clean, QUALITY! I wouldn't;t mind if it was a little fuller on the feel, but it is so smashable for a 6.8, what a party brew it is. Overall, a practically perfect IPA that is to be enjoyed! Absolutely grab at least a 6er!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,FireMedk,3.71,"Good seasonal IPA and tastes just like a Sierra Nevada IPA. Citrus notes with pine and malt, not to mention the hoppiness that has made Sierra Nevada famous over the years.

140,1904,Get_me_an_IPA,4.71,"Look - Gorgeous copper elixir with a hint of yeasty haze... pillowy, whipped cream head that is about best in the world. Yes it's true.  Smell - Wonderful balance of malted barley and hops. Not as wonderful dank citrus as Heady Topper, but there is pine and grapefruit scents in the aroma profile.  Taste - Possibly the very best in the entire world, if you acquire the IPA lover's knack for bitter! This is the best tasting stuff ever brewed perhaps; well done, Sierra Nevada!! Well done, indeed. Thank you!! It's one of the best-tasting beers ever made in our earth's long history. And the fine aftertaste goes on and on for 15 or twenty minutes!  Mouthfeel - Perfect balance of creamy head, carbonated liquid, and not thin bit not too thick body. Dangerous, as the mouthfeel alone can make you open another... World best mouthfeel here. Perfection!  Overall - This is the product of American craft brewing producing beet at its very best. My everyday beer for over a decade, the beer I have thoroughly enjoyed without tiring of it for over 12 years. After tasting all of the finest beers in the world, this is the one I always stock up on in winter because I don't tire of it and it always delivers.

The original rating (L :4.25 |S :3.75 |T:4 | F: 4 |O:4 | BA Rating 3.96, rDev : -5%) was with a bottle that was from September, tasted in December, and not refrigerated, so at least 6 weeks older than this one.  Translucent orange-amber, with two fingers of long-lasting pale tan head, that leaves 1/4"" ring, two-bubbles-deep surface sheeting, and substantial(1""+) lacing that covers about half the surface area in that zone.  Smell is orange rind, pine, and a bit of biscuity malt .  Taste is similar to aroma, but with a slight edge to the pine. Moderate, lingering bitterness.  Feel is initially creamy, then smooth and barely slick, with very,very fine soft carbonation bite. Slightly drying finish, that lingers awhile.  Overall, I now see why this is eagerly anticipated by so many. It first showed up here at three weeks old, rather than the usual eight to ten weeks . It makes a difference!

Smell- Caramel malts, citrus (grapefruit, orange and lemon), light pine and herbal/spicy notes.  Taste- Much like the aroma with a bit of tangy cherry in the mix. Tasty stuff.  Feel- Medium/light bodied, crisp, lingering light bitterness in the finish, pretty well balanced. Above average carbonation on the tongue.  O- A pretty solid offering overall. Worthy of a repeat purchase in the near future.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,VTbrewfan,4.15,"Pours a translucent amber brown with off white tannish head and lacing. Solid head retention. Pine and freshly baked bread on the nose, lots of sweet malt flavors, some baking spice. Lingering bitterness that comes through on the finish. Not too citrus or fruit forward- leans more heavily on the pine and bitter west coast style. Really nice IPA for the cold fall and winter months. Kind of a cross between a west coast IPA with characteristics of an amber ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Good carbonation and lacing. Rich sweet, malty aroma and hops. Taste is smooth, malty, hoppy blend that's not too strong. Has some bitterness but still very likeable. A rather thin mouthfeel that makes for easy drinking. Nice on the back-end.

140,1904,clausthaler,3.73,"Tasting a 2017 release, couldn't tell you if it's been temperature abused or not. But it holds up pretty well. For an old-er school style of IPA 2 years old, it's pretty good. I prefer it to Founder's Centennial, which is what I'd say it's most similar to (of what I have had, and I haven't tried west coast IPA's extensively being on the east coast). It has a malty backbone, but the hops come forward first and the malt is hangs out underneath the grapefruity-bitter pithy hop nose and flavor.

T- Quite hoppy/dry/contemporary but rather thin in parallel for a 6.8%. The contempory IPA hopping (rather too prominent to me) continues. A few sips in I'm getting a more rounded flavour, the rich notes coming through, and I'm thinking this is a hipster beer, but for a more mature and sophisticated audience. F- Hipster in style, but rich enough to bring a facet of adult indulgence. It's modern and hoppy but isn't out to make kiddy bludgeoning statements. O- Has the hipster hop-bomb matured, it's beard greyed a touch and got somewhat wiser? It's still unecessarily over-hopped (aka out of balance) to me, but should work for a more mature audience who favour hop-centric beers, 330ml, BB: 01/10/2020 Bought from Wholefoods London W8 £2.99.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,hoptheology,3.95,"12 oz bottle 10/11/19 Samuel Adams Ugly Sweater pint glass Here we go.  A deep toasted caramel color with an off-white head of 2 fingers, very creamy, receding to a bubbly half-finger.  Aroma is of mouth-watering citrusy hops and medium-dark toast. Slight wet evergreen pops up behind that with notes of persimmon and mango.  A formidable tongue-scraping bitterness starts this off, (I forgot how unflinchingly bitter west coast IPAs can be) with heavy notes of pine, toffee, toasted pumpernickel, sweet brown sugar, lemon peel, grapefruit peel, and banana peel. Fading notes of evergreen, pine cone, and bitter hop dust. It is a palate scrubber for sure.  Feel is creamy and smooth, with enough carbonation and alcohol warmth to keep it exciting. Nearly perfect alcohol warmth, it is an artistic move and a winter warmer for sure.  Overall a very very good west coast style IPA if you don't mind tongue scrubbing bitterness. I gravitate towards milder IPAs myself, but this will satisfy any traditional hop head. Merry Christmas.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cardfan212,3.91,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a shaker pint.  Look - A cloudy deep golden amber with a gigantic eggshell colored head.  Smell - Piney and resiny with a fine malty backbone and air of sugar cookie. Fairly lightly scented but still very clear.  Taste - The hops stab you right in the center of the tongue as a strong sweetness envelops the edges of the tongue. A strange experience, but interesting.  Feel - A perfect medium body with a prickly carbonation that matches the piney flavor.  Overall - Well balanced between bitter and sweet. Not overly done like most seasonal beers. It just lets the beer do the talking.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Mindcrime1000,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a nonic glass.  Pours a reddish amber with just a touch of haze. An excellent three-fingered foamy light-tan head slowly subsides and gives way to excellent lacing. Very small bubbles constantly rise from the bottom of the glass.  Mild caramel malt, citrus zest, floral and grassy hops, and just a bit of pine resin all hit the nose.  The brew is spectacularly balanced and flavorful. The caramel malts manifest in a honey-graham sweetness up front, but there is a fine earthy, grassy, and floral (lavender?) hop profile in mid-quaff that provides an outstanding counterpoint. Citrus and pine resin arrive at the finish with just a hint of warming alcohol. No one thing stands out, but each separate note is distinguishable from the others, even as they are marrying one another quite well.  The brew is solidly medium. It trends toward a drying, nearly crisp finish, thanks to some excellent but not overwhelming carbonation. It finishes with a bit of herbal warmth from the alcohol.  Very restrained in its bitterness, particularly for the style, Celebration is one tasty well-balanced brew. Not quite as malty as a DIPA, but not trying to win a withering IBU battle either. Smooth and very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,steveh,4.42,"I guess 9 years is a good milepost to revisit an old favorite -- what with so much discussion about the Celebration being had.  2019 batch, bottled 10/07/19.  Poured into my imperial Nonic.  L -- Clear, deep bronze color with a dense and sticky off-white head that holds up very well.  S -- Light pine, mild citrus, and bright fruit esters of peach or apricot.  Some peppery alcohol and light caramel back.  T -- Pine resin up front with stone fruit juiciness and peppery alcohol.  Biscuit malt and light caramel balance the hops and their bitterness without grabbing the limelight.  Spicy and bitter herbal hop character rounds out the aftertaste and finish with a lingering malt sweetness present.  M -- Mouthfeel is syrupy and almost sticky.  Body is medium robust to robust.  O -- A classic masterpiece that always takes me back in time to those early years of discovering beer beyond macro swill.  Not a beer for the meek with its hop dominance, but well worth any new beer drinker's experience to understand flavorful beer -- let alone understanding that good beer in the U.S. really has been around nearly 40 years.  December 13, 2010 review: Never reviewed this one in the past -- a perfect, 13° day in N. Illinois to fit the beer!  A -- Hazy amber-orange with a resilient, foamy, off white head.  S -- Piny, citrus, spicy & earthy nose. The vaguest of biscuit malt back.  T -- Spicy, pine resin hops up front that blend into citrusy esters. Biscuit malt flavor in the middle is low and clean with some mild sweetness that helps to balance, but certainly doesn't overpower, the resiny bitterness in the finish and aftertaste.  M -- Body is medium with the bitterness creating a near astringent sensation in the mouthfeel. Otherwise, the mouthfeel behind the resins is rather smooth, not at all unattenuated.  D -- This beer is delicious, which adds to its drinkability, but the resinous mouthfeel and alcohol become a little fatiguing.

140,1904,jrc1093,4.02,"Bottled on 10/14/19  Pours a clear burnt orange-copper body topped towering thick head of off-white foam; excellent retention produces a rocky cap while leaving a comprehensive spatter of soapy, webby lacing clinging around the glass.  Aroma is a touch quiet but steadily balanced, highlighting floral notes to welcome in wisps of fresh ruby red grapefruit and orange pulp; malt tones redolent of cinnamon and nutmeg building to the finish.  Taste features tangerine and grapefruit rind comfortably integrating piney hops; gritty, rich malt imparting tones of cinnamon and nutmeg mashing with earthy resin and returning citrus peel through the finish.  Mouthfeel shows a medium body with moderate-high carbonation; pillowy mid-palate and extensively clean and taut throughout; malt sweetness seeps into a subdued bitter swallow.  Exceptional consistency meets a ripe harmony of (fresh) hops and malt, with the unique maltier aspects imparting a complexity to match the simplicity of the hop profile.

140,1904,SierraNevallagash,4.28,"Pours a brilliantly clear, deep glowing copper hue, topped with two fingers of remarkably dense tan foam with impressive retention. Plentiful bubbles ascending to feed the cap of foam, which eventually recedes, leaving a thick ring of tenacious lacing.  Nose: Very reminiscent of SNPA, though perhaps lacking some of its punch. A classic base of sweet, toasty caramel malt showcases the remarkably floral hops. The overall bouquet is perhaps a little less piney than its flagship cousin, but the floral notes are delightfully fragrant and delicate. Aromas honeyed biscuits, surrounded by magnolia, gardenia, orange blossom, lemon blossom, grapefruit oil, and a wisp of forest in the spring.  Palate: The differences between SNPA and Celebration become much more apparent here. First sip reveals a caramel malt sweetness that comes across slightly more tame and restrained than Pale Ale, and the hops possess an entirely different profile. The resinous bitterness comes on much sooner, and all of the wonderful floral notes are much more pronounced and seemingly ""fresher"" - more vibrant, bright, and floral in nature. There's no pithy grapefruit, but rather a resinous green character in its place. All the floral notes from the nose are just as present, but on the palate, it translates more like an ultra fresh botanical elixir, with a wonderfully delicate malty base. The finish is dry and resinous, with a gentle-yet-pronounced hoppy bitterness, with has a very slow and shalloe decay, yet lacks any and all metallic aftertaste.  Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is on the lighter end of medium-bodied, perhaps a bit more crisp than SNPA. The caramel malt doesn't add the least bit of syrupy thickness that is often present in classic IPAs like this. Effervescence is perfectly balaced, precisely where it should be, and puts this ale in that slim category of loaded with flavour, yet insanely drinkable. Not a single flaw in this category.  Overall: This is a very unique beer, though it's appeal doesn't come in the form of complexity, or fancy bells and whistles, but rather its simplicity, and its use of fresher hops. It's a classic IPA by the books. It's also remarkably balanced, which can be difficult to find in modern variations of the style. The hops add this incredible fresh component that cannot really be described, but rather must be experienced firsthand. You can just tell there's something unique about this beer. There's no hint of any sort of stale elements, nor any mustiness of any sort. It's just a wonderfully balanced IPA made with fresh, resinous, dried hops. You just can't beat it. While not an exact clone by any means, I personally find a few similarities between Celebration and Pliny The Elder, and that alone should speak volumes.

The name has also changed to Celebration Fresh Hopped IPA. I am not 100% sure if this is the first year for this name.  My quick observation is that I like this year's batch even better than the past years. It is, to me the perfect balance of hops and body that I imagine. At 6.8 ABV it is not weak, but is also not a knock out beer either.

140,1904,unlikelyspiderperson,3.98,Pours a very old school deep orange/amber for an IPA. Nice off white head with great retention and great carbonation. Smell is brightly piney with light citrus notes and a pleasant crackery sweetness. Again showing a very old school bent compared to the tropical fruit salad of modern american IPAs. Taste is pleasantly balanced between sharply bitter pine hops and rich bready malt. Reminiscent of a hoppy amber or red ale. The sweet/bitter flavor dance plays out well across the whole flavor. Mouthfeel is nicely crisp with an adequate body. This is definitely a classic crisp IPA. This is a classic and an old favorite of mine but I do feel like it's showing its age. Not so exciting as it once was and certainly not the best fresh hop beer available anymore. A nice yearly treat none the less though.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,nosho,3.95,"i don't know about nose, finish, or notes but my feeling is that this is a confused ale, in general. i like specific things, particularly body and color - but the flavor, based on those two aspects which elevatec my expectations, was surprisingly bland. to my palate, i expected a little more tang (fruit forward?) and on the tongue, more zip. on the other hand, it accompanies and complements a meal rather well so i will buy more of it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

(4.5)  S: Bright pithy, piney West coast hopping and a little spicy, caramely malt. (4.25)  T: Follows the nose. Hops and brown bread with a little spice and a light caramel flavor to finish it off. (4.25)  M: Medium body with active carbonation a meaty feel with the malt and a fairly dry finish. (4.25)  O: Excellent beer. Pleasant seems like the best descriptor to me. I can't believe I've never managed to have this before. Lovely looking in the glass. The nose is pungently hoppy but not overbearing. Bright pine and bitter citrus. There is also some nice malt character and both carry over into the flavor. It is easy to drink and we'll balanced between the various parts of the proverbial whole. An excellent beer that I will seek out in future years. Sucks that it isn't more available outside the US as a seasonal (or in Quebec at least). Glad I have 5 more to drink.

It has an incredible hop taste-bready with fruit and pine throughout-that has a slight burn on the roof of my mouth.

Pours a beautiful amber color, a bit unusual for the typical IPA. The hop aroma is very front and center, citrus and pine, a mild yet assured bitterness, At 6.8 ABV this is definitely higher in alcohol, but you won't even notice while drinking.

A little pine and a little fruit. Can pick up some of the malt sweetness as well. Taste - It's just a very good IPA. It has the typical hop to malt ratio that balances it out real nice. The hops taste super fresh, not all that bitter but it's certainly going to be bitter with the amount of hops they added. It's medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. I love this beer with my Thanksgiving or Christmas meal, it's not too heavy that it fills me up but it's smooth and adds some different flavor to the meal.  Overall, this is a very hoppy beer.

140,1904,gearinches,4.43,"Rating IPAs is tough. Here in New England we have brewers like Tree House that turnout exceptional craft beers. But for many/most of them you have to drive an hour or two, stand in line, and pay $4 +/- a can. How can you compare that to beers like SN Celebration that, in season, are available almost everywhere at about $1/bottle? If money is not to be considered, and drive time is not to be considered, and standing in line time is not to be considered, then Tree House Alter Ego or Green or etc is a somewhat better beer than Celebration. But those factors have to be considered.  On a value basis, considering all above, this beer stands with the best. Easily. It's great fresh, in November thru January. But I just had a bottle now in August. The character has changed but not the satisfaction. Smoother, richer, still unique. Don't be afraid to buy several cases in late Fall and if you don't finish all of them you'll still have a treat 9 to 12 months later (I'm going to cellar a few and see what happens after a couple years, a la the Trader Joe's/Unibroue Christmas beer).

140,1904,AleManDan,4.17,"One of my favorites. A ""red"" IPA and when fresh, a tastebud tingling sensation overload. Piney and hoppy and fruity but also backed by a significant toasted caramel malt foundation that brings out visions of Christmas hearths and pine trees and sweets, and also makes the beer look more like a red/amber ale and less of a typical West Coast IPA which is what this is, just maltier. It's almost more like a beer made by Stone, definitely a west coast India Pale Ale...you can smell the hops from a few feet away if your nose is clear!  Perhaps my favorite beer by Sierra Nevada and my excuse to drink IPAs during the holidays! Every year it's a bit different, this year (2022) it's still great and is bitter, balanced, and finishes rather dry despite being more malty than other IPAs.

Wow...nothing better.

140,1904,monkist,4.63,"How long have I been wanting to try this Celebration IPA! Ever since I read about it first and heard stories of its freshness... Now finally I found this around and it was relatively still fresh, with a bottling date of 31.10.2017, about two months and a half ago (of course over in California I might have been get it when it came right out but now we're talking about Europe and small batch imports - I am happy that it got here at all). Still it's quite fresh. Has an amazingly rich color, a vivid amber/dark golden that talks about the purity of this beer and its ingredients. And they don't let you down. Its smell tells you that Sierra achieved an outstanding balance between aroma and bittering hops and they are overflowing, still ripe with freshness. And the taste... I was dumbfounded by its smoothness. The way the hop bitterness flows, first dense and intense, grassy, piney, earthy aromas that are thick like honey - and turn to fruity, piney bitter bitterness in the end. A magical composition of hops. It is a Celebration ale, to bow your heads down before the greatness of hops, the brewing genius of Sierra Nevada. It is perhaps not as in your face as you might expect such a beer but the depths, the complexity and the content is amazing. It is a beer that I was most happy to drink and would enjoy having it again and again. Sierra Nevada at its best. Bravo!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,IPAHvntr,4.31,"Very nice ipa. This usesmalt right. It doesn’t overpower or compete with the hop flavor, but takes a backseat and let’s the hop shine while still being there to give it support when it needs it.

Especially if you like a bit more malt",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Snowcrash000,4.17,"Pours a cloudy, dark amber coloration with a large, fluffy, lasting head. Smells of biscuity, slightly grainy and caramelly malt and resinous, citrus hops, with notes of grapefruit and pine. Taste is an excellent balance of biscuity, caramel, slightly grainy malt and fruity, bitter and resinous hops, with notes of grapefruit, orange peel and pine, Finishes with a medium/strong bitterness and some grapefruit and pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  This makes for a great old school IPA with a certain East Coast vibe, the bitter, resinous hops being balanced against a strong, slightly sweet malt backbone perfectly. The first time I had this it was over two years old and I was really impressed by how much resinous bitterness was still left in it, although the sweet malts had clearly taken over. Now, at four months old, those bitter, resinous hops and citrus notes clearly shine through a lot more distinctly, making for and even more enjoyable brew. There certainly is a reason that this is a classic and I really wish that I could get my hands on this even more fresh and regularly, although it really is a beer that keeps up incredibly well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: Crisp, piney and light resin hop flavors, fruity, with a caramel, biscuit-like malt sweetness, moderate hop bitterness with a dry finish.  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  O: Tasty; every year it's interesting to see how Sierra Nevada slightly changes up the recipe. Always enjoyable to drink annually.    l flavor is present.

140,1904,dss27,4.27,"No need to add comments as this is obviously a very well-known quantity and one of the gold standards for American IPA (borderline DIPA by any reasonable standard), other than to add, should separate pages exist for each ""vintage"" (or any other limited edition/seasonal beers) as they vary from year to year? I have a bunch of these (plus Bigfoots, Thomas Hardy's, JW Lee's Harvest, some Bells products, and others--all on lees of course) going back quite a few years (some from the mid-'90s) and it's interesting how they change (not always for the better, especially for hoppy beers, but these hold up quite well).

140,1904,Dr_Gonzo,4.5,"Poured into a clear glass. Has a cherry-amber color (festive) and a thick dark-golden head that gradually dissipates. Good carbonation.  Smells citrusy, orange and grapefruit peel masking the nose. Also smells of pineapple. Other sweet malt and piney scents that may remind the drinker of Christmas trees and sweets. Floral notes. Faint biscuit smell. This all balances the hoppy smell which strikes the nose very well.  Tastes piney and very fruity, the flavors of cherry and pineapple being the most prominent. A light caramel flavor is present. The taste was more assertive than the smell for sure. Was also bitter in the aftertaste with remnants of grapefruit peel. Altogether crisp and refreshing.  This was quite exceptional. A very refined combination of citrus, pine, and floral flavors that makes the drinker imagine Christmas throughout the whole experience.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The smell is sweet and malty with notes of toffee & caramel with slight pine notes. Almost smells like a hoppy brown ale. The taste comes in with a strong pine that I love and follows up with the sweeter malty backbone. Seems like it's got a lot more spice kick to it this year. Like a spicy rye character to my taste buds. Very good treat.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,TooManyGlasses,4.5,2017 edition - pours a deep clear copper colour with 1 finger off white head. Caramel malt with a bit of piney bitterness on the nose. Taste of hoppy malt followed by grapefruit/citrus rind with pine bitterness that coats the palate and hangs on. Really nice hop forward beer.  Dec 9/2020  2020 Edition. First of the year with arrival in Edmonton. Love this more every year. Beautiful reddish copper with finger + of almost white head. Piney hops but with caramel malt wafting up the nose nicely. Taste sweet caramel malt that is quickly blown away by the resinous piney hop and citrus bitterness that engulfs the palate. The malt sweetness and hop bite integrate perfectly through a clean medium mouthfeel as the bittersweetness lingers. The holidays have arrived.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,omahawk,4.12,"I look forward to this beer every year. It pours a dark red copper with a small foam head that lingers. Smell is sharp pine with hints of citrus and malt. Taste is bitter forward with malt backing. This is an old school red IPA. It could be “modernized” with a little more juicy hop flavor, and slightly less bitter. But somehow, the fact that it doesn’t change and remains true to its roots makes I like it after all these years. It might be somewhat of a relic from a past era, but it still holds up well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,KennyDerenbecker,4.09,Sierra Nevada’s Celebration Fresh Hop IPA is an excellent winter seasonal beer. Pours an amber color with a heavy off white head. Has great lacing all around the glass.

It has a nearly perfect balance of light yet almost chewy roasted malt sweetness and piney/grapefruity hops that linger yet don't overpower or sting the tongue. From the time you inhale and it passes the lips, across the tongue, down the throat, to a final exhale, this gorgeous rusty ruby hued ale is like it's making sweet love to all of my senses.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tucson_brewson,4.56,"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.  L - Pours a rich, clear, red-amber color with a generous inch of soapy, white foam. The head lingers throughout the session, with generous bubbles and a lot of sticky retention to the side of the glass. Probably the best-looking beer I've poured.  S - Smells almost like an amber or red ale. Sweet caramel malt, citrus rind, apple, spice, some pine and floral hops but the malty sweetness stands out.  T - A near-perfect balance of bitter hops and malty sweetness. Caramel, toffee, citrus rind, roasted bready malt, burnt sugar, finishes with a nice bitter bite from the fresh piney hops.  F - Light-to-medium bodied with a creamy, smooth head. Moderate carbonation, for all of the different characteristics this offers, it finishes clean and crisp, very drinkable.  O - A very enjoyable seasonable offering from Sierra Nevada. I love their pale ale, and this is like the flagship beer with a bit more oomph to it for the colder, winter weather. A very unique IPA with a lot of character, both in looks and in taste. Definitely worth trying, if not purchasing consistently throughout the holidays.

About a finger of off-white head, moderate retention, good lacing. Smell is floral with a hint of pine, both are noticeable but not overpowering.

140,1904,Lone_Freighter,4.16,"Had several times and enjoyed enough to wish to say something positive about this beer here. The appearance was a strong burnt dark orange to malted brown color with a cap of a little white foamy head that swiftly died off. Some lace, somewhat stringy and sliding off fairly quick. The aroma had that strong smooth West coast styled malt bill flowing over a clean crisp bright citrusy to sprucy needle-like hoppiness. It has always smelled like that to me for as long as I can remember. The flavor was an awesome balance of the sweet clean malts to the bitter and bright citrusy and piney hoppiness. Mainly a malty aftertaste with a touch of those sprucy to citrusy hops. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fine sessionability about it. Carbonation felt good. ABV felt as projected. Nice crisp semi-sweet malty to sweet hoppy and semi-bitter finish (the same as always). Overall, what's not to love about this beer. It's got over 10k amount of reviews and sits at 4.15 out of 5 on BA at the moment. Of course, I come back to this every year and seems like it doesn't even need me to talk about it to anyone as it has stood the test of time and will continue to do so.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A: Beautiful reddish amber with a two finger khaki head and nice lacing. S: Describing smell is a weakness of mine. So I'll pass. It's nice, just can't describe it. T: Awesome-- nice hop bitterness comes through. It reminds me of grapefruit rind and pine. Malty sweetness balances this out, but the finish is a nice hoppiness that's calling for me to have another sip. F: Medium body, nice finish. Overall: Perhaps my favorite IPA, seasonal, and beer of all time. It's solid year in and year out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Czequershuus,4.07,"This beer pours a rich amber with a large head, The aroma features pine, cannabis, resin, orange peel, cinnamon, and caramel. The flavor starts somewhat sweet, with orange peel and clementine flesh, the it dried out with bitter pine, cedar, cannabis, and an oily, resinous finish. The mouthfeel is full with lush carbonation. Overall I see why this is a classic - it does have exquisite balance, and a host of classic, bitter flavors.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MrRB,3.8,An interesting and quite enjoyable fresh hop ale. Beguiling reddish color and moderate tan head. Aromas of fresh fruit and grass dominate.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is some definite hop oil presence that adds a slickness while never going too sweet or sticky. Overall, wonderful and made better with 19 day old delivery in cans.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,california_republic,5,"Look: Very generous, foamy head that stays up a long time. As it subsides, it gets pillowy like cumulus clouds and leaves behind microfoam that clings to the side of the glass with a lot of coverage. Impressive and fresh, with a brew date of 10/3/17 being consumed on 10/31/17. Color is brownish amber and is actually pretty clear, unless you tip the bottle over all the way and let in the yeast to your glass.  Smell: Simply great. Fragrant apple, orange blossom and peel, pear, and berries. An amazingly American fragrance that will not fail to impress. I don't get much pine at all, maybe a tiny bit, which probably makes it unique among the high-quality hop-bomb American IPAs these days.  Taste: The taste is where the hops come back, with your familiar iconic west coast IPA pine and citrus. I also get orange peel and a lot of bright but not sour fruit flavors, which I interpret to be berries. There's also a bit of roasted maltiness to it, but the hops take center stage much more than in Pale Ale.  Feel: There's a creamyness to it from the many small bubbles in such a fresh brew. Sweet, but still crisp. Medium herbal bitterness around the level of Pale Ale but overall brighter than Pale Ale. Malts are of the roasted kind and not the crackery kind of lagers, but the malts are very slight. The finish is probably the weaker spot of this otherwise flawless American IPA as it's not as malty as Pale Ale and not as hoppy as Torpedo or Hop Hunter. But you have to keep in mind that Celebration has been around since 1981, a year after Pale Ale and long before craft beer drinkers got accustomed to the hop bombs of today.  Overall: Most brewers use their winter seasonal to concoct pumpkin spice dark malt agglomerations without the pumpkin, but Sierra Nevada was not founded on such gimmicks. They built themselves on being the one of the first masters of American hops, and Celebration reflects their history and focus. Despite being a winter seasonal, Celebration has nothing to do with Christmas or spice and instead is instead a celebration of the start of the hop harvest, featuring the freshest hops of the year. This is well reflected in the outstanding head, aroma, taste, and texture of this beer, even compared to Sierra Nevada's year-round beers. The only glaring flaw is that the finish is surprisingly not as hop-heavy as Torpedo ""Extra"" IPA or even Hop Hunter, which probably reflects the fact that Celebration is a much older ale than the hop bombs that craft beer drinkers have gotten used to.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Though not described anywhere as an ""unfiltered"" beer, there's lots of 'hop bits' in suspension. Be careful not to leave any of those last, sticky drops behind in the bottle !!  Taste is more malt-forward, aftertaste a bit syrupy. Love it. Truly a ""malty IPA"", as opposed to the typical, purposely misnamed amber ale that so many other breweries use to ring the till.

Smell - Malt and orange zest stand out from the beginning with a suggestion of potential spice and an inviting freshness  Taste - Now, I'm not a huge IPA fan, but I can tell this is a good one. Sweet malt balanced by a bitter hop. That being said, there's a bright orange peel taste to the bitterness and a green, grassy, herbaceous flavour behind it all.  Feel - I wasn't expecting much fullness until I saw the colour and, again, I am not let down. There's a bready fullness to it that coats your tongue with a thick layer.

140,1904,Easton70,3.58,"I bought a 6-pack of this in Trader Joes in Bellingham. It was a month before Christmas and I wanted some US beers for the festive season so I was sold on this beer's snowy label. As a result, I was expecting a spicey, sweet ale but it's not. To that extent, I was initially disappointed when I tried it one evening with other winter beers but, take Christmas out of the equation and this is an amazing beer.  Firstly, that head lasts forever and I love constant lacing on the glass u till the last mouthful. It's darker than most IPAs and that's the only element that fits Christmas.  I found the aroma lacking but I've been suffering from a nagging cold so it's perhaps that.  The taste is full and the mouthfeel is great. The bitterness really hits you in the finish but you expect that with a fresh hopped IPA.  Bottom line; this is a great great beer regardless of the time of year. I may keep one to see how it ages; whether the bitterness fails over time or the caramel notes improve.....: who knows.  Definately worth a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,drunkenmess,3.88,"Pours a dark murky copper color body with an off white, frothy tan head. Its apperance reminds me of autumn. Smell is very mild malt and citrus hops. Taste is a great mouthful of piney hops with pops of flavor from dank resinous fruits. Followed by that light malt bready backbone that i always detect in SN brews. Body is well balanced and full. Med to high carbonation makes this easy to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Bartleby91,4.16,This is such a classic ipa that has really stood the test of time.  The appearance is a really pretty copper/amber with a billowy two finger white head that lingers with good lacing.  The aroma is a classic west coast ipa with pine and citrus hops along with a sweet bready maltiness.  The taste follows the nose with a piney citrus hop note along with a bready caramel malt sweetness that balances out the hoppiness.  The palate is medium with lingering piney resin and bready malt sweetness.  Overall this is a classic of the craft beer world that is still one of the better winter seasonals around.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,barknee,4.33,"SNCA pours a deep amber with a massive & long lasting dark tan head. Fresh piney hops and massive malts soar from the glass, beckoning one to taste. Beautifully balanced; bitter, slightly sweet and mouth coating, its hard to believe this brew originates from a micro-macro brewery having such massive distribution. It is a quality craft product all the way, a truly outstanding and impressive effort. So satisfying for a mid-weight brew, its fantastic with or without food, the taste lasts for several minutes in the mouth. Seek it, buy it, enjoy it!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,acmurphy696,4.22,"This is a good tasting IPA with a fantastic appearance and a pleasant aroma.

S: Super dank, herbal and citrusy. Just a wondrous aroma here.  T: Again, a lot of dank pine and herbal and citrus. Wonderful IPA.  F: Light, crisp, dry.  O: Wonderful IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DrQuantum,4.67,"This is a really great IPA from Sierra Nevada - I'd have to say it's up there right alongside some of my favorite craft brewed IPAs. Great hop flavor and floral nose, with clear hints of pine and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is just right - not heavy at all, but perfectly balanced. Very reasonably priced selection that I'd highly recommend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HorseheadsHophead,4.35,"L: Pours our clear copper. In the glass, a slightly hazy, translucent amber with visible streams of bubbles. The head is tight, slightly creamy, and beige. The retention is fairly good, but dies down somewhat after a minute. The lacing is excellent, though. Sticky and splotchy.  S: Bright and hoppy; spruce tip and pine sap, lots of grapefruit flesh and peel, spicy with an almost minty herbal thing, and then a solid malt backbone that is both caramelly and toasty.  T: Like biting into a grapefruit. The bitterness and the oils of the peel and pith, and the juicy, tart, sweetness of the flesh. This blends with a bright, green spruce character. The malt backbone is sweet, but not detracting. Caramel at first, and then toasty to balance it out. Instead of detracting from the hops, the toasty sweetness of the malt combines with the hops, lending an even sweeter red grapefruit flavor, and almost a tart cherry kind of thing. The finish is more earthy, spicy pine, like the pine resin, which makes this beer very balanced, and then there's just enough of dryness and a lingering citrus bitterness to demand another sip.  F: Medium-bodied, but feels full and oily on the tongue, yet with ample carbonation to push it quickly across the palate and scrub your taste buds clean.  O: I haven't had this beer in two years, and it still tastes as good as I remember despite how much my palate has changed. When it comes to freshly hopped, old school west coast IPAs, Sierra Nevada still nails it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Fordcoyote15,4,Its remarkable how peppery and spicy these hops are. Last year I called it stale and rated it straight 3.75s.

Excellent head retention.  Smell: Light malts, hops, and then citrus finishing with a sharp hop bite.  Taste: Very well balanced. There is a slight hop bitterness on the swallow but this is pretty laid back for an IPA.  Feel: Almost creamy mouthfeel, medium body. moderate carbonation and a bit dry.

140,1904,ab63587,4.23,"Unique look that is a little darker than other IPAs. Spicy citrus aroma with a full glass, but more of an earthy aroma when empty. Fresh and flavorful, with a smooth swallow. For me, the post swallow revealed the Chinook hops, with a spicy pine aftertaste. A must have for your winter beer selection. Light a fire, play some vinyl, pull your girl close, and split a sixer of Celebration Ale. You won't be disappointed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TigerSweat,4.67,"This is one of my all time favorites. Dark amber in color with a beautiful cream colored head. Lacing is also solid. A hoppy brew thats perfect balanced with sweet malts. There's no spices or dark fruit used in the brewing process which is a plus for me. I have to believe that this beer inspired many breweries that are popular today. Of the 100's of beers that I've tried in my day, Sierra Nevada celebration is probably still the best. Buy it - you won't be disappointed",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Some of the head was still in the bottom of the glass after I finished the beer. Gobs of sticky lacing.  Aroma is all hop. Citrus, pine, minty notes abound.  Taste at the start and finish is a terrific hop bitterness with a touch of bready malt in the middle. Moderate carbonation and a pleasant, slightly oily mouthfeel. Overall, this is a superb beer. Definitely my favorite Christmas brew. In my top 3 favorite beers ever. Seek this out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Medium body and carbonation with a smooth finish.  O: I'm still fairly new to IPAs, but I'm glad I tried this one. Probably not something I would drink more than one of in a sitting, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down if I come across another.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tekstr1der,4.29,"Rich dark amber pour with beige cap that fades to a ring. Aroma is earthy hop, floral notes with a hint of pine and just-noticeable bready malt. Flavor follows identically as the well-balance ensemble of flavors meld with a slightly hop-forward advance throughout the sip. Super tasty, and very pleasant aftertaste. I usually have this each year and enjoy it, but don't remember it being damn good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Jesterr44,3.96,"Damn, is this frothy! Gave it a nice pour & it provided me with a nice thick frothy head which I've had to wait longer than normal to die down so I can have a sip. I can certainly smell the hops as I wait. Now minutes later, the head retention is incredible. Impressive. Now let's see how it tastes. There is definitely a good strong hop kick, but not as many flavours as I'd like. Mostly pine & some spice, not much else but quite a bit of bready maltiness in there as well which doesn't quite do what is needed to balance out the harshness of the hops. Not a bad drink, full marks for head retention, but not a taste that I will seek out when there are so many tastier IPAs out there. If you like hops first & don't care much for a more complex blend, you may like it more than I did.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,foglemgs,4.87,"An excellent winter ale! Next to Torpedo, this is probably my favorite offering from Sierra Nevada. They don't try to dress this seasonal brew up (as other brewers do) with too many different flavors. Sierra Nevada sticks to what they're good at: hops, and it's damn tasty.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,LAp,4,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a far more amber (a far darker) color than anticipated, with a relatively thick 1.5 finger head. The nose is relatively standard SN IPA, but the palate is something somewhat different. They definitely bring out a better hop blend than their base pale ale and single hop beers (something more akin to hop hunter), but an unusually malty base is present that plants this beers much more squarely in the East Coast IPA camp than any of the beers I have tried from them to date. Not a bad beer. Very pleasant as far as ECIPAs go. Just not a beer I'd go out of my way to buy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: Piney and bitter hops, some notes of caramel malt, some floral and sap. Malt isn't too noticeable this is the beer for those that like hops, definitely a little unbalanced forward hops.

Smell of pacific hops, pine, and roasted malts. Wonderful bitter sweet balance in this IPA that hits the mark. If I am pining for an IPA this winter, this medium-bodied one that sticks to your cheeks and coats your palette with hoppy evergreen is it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BeerBobber,4.04,Pours a beautiful dark hazy copper with a nice thick frothy tan head. Leaves a nice lacing on the glass as well. Smell is very floral with a citrus note. Something like a pineapple smell here also. A bit of dank grassy smell in here as well. Flowery citrus taste with a burn of hops across the middle of the tongue and a bunch of bitter on the back of the swallow. There is just enough malts here to counter a massive over rush of the hops. Mouth feel starts at an almost medium and a bit oily but on the back end finishes pretty dry with some bitterness following. Overall this is a very refreshing and tasty IPA. It seems interesting that this is only offered once a year as I could see this selling quite well. Perhaps Sierra Nevada does not want to compete against other offerings in their lineup.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Ahypercube,4.73,"Always enjoy seeing this one on the shelves this time of year. A reliable classic from one of my favorite breweries; the price to quality ratio is just damn impressive. From a 12 oz bottle into a chalice:  L: Pours with a beautiful brownish amber color and about one finger of fluffy beige head, with very fine bubbles. Carbonation persists fervently and the lacing forms very attractive wavy rings around the glass. Beautiful. I'll call this a 5.  S: Piney, peppery and a little sour. Very herbal too, with hints of mint, camphor and clove as well as a rich malt profile--including toasty french bread and nutty oat notes.  T: This is the second time I have been surprised with how tasty this beer is. One of the few IPAs I have tried that opens with malt flavors (which I strongly appreciate): the first that hits me is a caramelly sweetness, which immediately blends with bitter-piney and peppery-spicy hop oil, but is fought back against by complex roasted barley malt profile. Not much fruitiness to this beer. Perhaps some pear, apricot and lemon. A finish of pure pine and menthol. I certainly don't miss the overdose of grapefruit rind I find in almost every west coast IPA.  F: Perfect. Thick but not sticky, carbonated but not frothy, smooth but not oily. An expert balance.  O: Perhaps the most affordable seasonal beer worth getting excited over. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Skrumpy,3.88,"I have been drinking this beer every holiday season for decades, & this years batch was excellent as usual. Coppery colored with a tan, foamy head. Streak lacing.

140,1904,Furgoose,4.28,"Fascinated by this beer. What they put on the label is a perfect description. It has a unique balance of pine and citrusy hops as well as a full malt.

T - huge malty awesomeness (the malt/grain is very dry and sweet at the same time), huge pine, the hops is super bitter in the best way, lots of earth, soil, baking spices, baking yeast, ripe fruits (dates, figs and the like), fresh everything and sexy as heck  M - full bodied, great balance, great complexity, medium carbonation, medium plus acidity and a hoppy-malty-sugary finish.  D/O - For how rich and creamy this IPA is it is somehow warming and at the same time refreshing. Each and every year I know it is the ""holiday season"" when this ale shows up in the cold boxes around town. Whether it is a six or 12 pack this ale is just a wonderful delight. Taste and looks like fall/winter and fall/Christmas. Grab a glass pour some ad enjoy the sounds, tastes and weather of the season! It's not your usual winter warmer but, awesome indeed.  Final thoughts - the price of this awesome ale is seemingly inexpensive at $8-9 a six pack and $12-15 a 12 pack.

Very large off white head with great retention. Very sticky.  S: Earthy, dank hop aroma. Also some fresh mint and a little malt.  T&F: Very hoppy, but not overly bitter. Very earthy hop flavor along with fresh mint like the nose. There is a good malt flavor in the background that is covered up by the hops, but not in bad way. Gives a warming feeling in the stomach. Finish is dry and crisp, but does not have an unpleasant bitterness. Has a pine aftertaste that lingers for awhile.  O: This is probably my new favorite IPA (granted, I have not had that many).

Feel is substantial but very drinkable.  Overall, this is an long-time favorite of mine, which I first enjoyed probably 30 years ago. Still really good, though what was cutting edge then has become an old-school classic.

Aromas are piney American hops with some spice and some herbal overtones. Earthy yeast and some fresh baked bread from the malt is also present. So drinkable. Medium/light body, resiny texture and crisp carbonation and just a slight astringency makes for great palate. Flavors are all a close to perfect balance of hop flavors, mild malt sweetness, and enough bitterness to qualify it as an IPA. Beer finishes dry with the hop IBUs making a late appearance. This is an old-school IPA that contrasts with today’s IBU bombs and less bitter English IPAs. - So drinkable and a classic!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Squire,4.16,"Hazy dark amber color with golden highlights.  Aroma is like walking a path between a Southern Pine forest and a citrus grove. Strong but not intense, nicely balanced.  Taste is beautiful. Hops forward with an entering sharpness of citrus peel but quickly melding into something richly multi layered. Hops on levels I've rarely experienced with each being richer than the one that preceded it. Well played. Malt appears mid palate and builds growing bolder all the way into the aftertaste where lt lingers until added to by a final hop flourish.  Full, round, creamy texture.  Overall it's impressive, I cannot find any fault with this brew. Malt is rich and full enough to offset the considerable hop presence and manages to be a partner rather than a prop. An underlying malt sweetness is also present but that emerges mostly at the finish. I suppose it had been there all along but that's where I really began to take notice. That or I was drinking too fast. My first thought on tasting this Ale was back to the store to get a second six pack before this one ran out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Harrison8,4.16,"2017 version: Pours a foggy ruby-red with a finger and a half of white head. Head retention is moderate with great lacing left behind. Citrus, pine, and spruce hops dance together in a decidedly hoppy, but balanced aroma. Flavor profile is pine, spruce, and citrus hops with biscuit malts. As per the Sierra Nevada usual, this IPA is hoppy, but sublimely balanced and approachable. Mouth feel is a little fizzy, but otherwise smooth. It has a medium thickness. Overall, a sublime IPA with great balance. It features some pleasant earthy hops. Easily approachable for even the most novice of IPA drinkers, and yet complex enough to tickle the taste buds of the seasoned.  Served in a 12oz snifter. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Pours a hazy, murky amber-orange. Thick beige head that retains for seemingly ever. Good lacing left behind. Aroma is composed of strong citrus, orange, and resin hop notes. Delightful. Taste is citrus forward, with resin hop notes following them up. Good solid orange/citrus taste at the end. Feel is medium in consistency, with good drinkability. Goes down easy, despite a more DIPA feel. Overall, an absolute fantastic rendition of the IPA. Really tasty, easy to drink, with an impressive look. Well done.  Served in a 12oz snifter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Beginner2,4.04,"12/5/21 revision. I've Had this many, many times (Let's say 7 times by 2016 and then I stopped cold turkey.) Six years later, I'm glad I revisited and revised a bit. While the hops recipe is supposed to be slightly different each year, then as now, I found it too hoppy for a session. I've tried it with bar food; but it runs interference on the food's flavor. Piney, hoppy after-taste is its biggest compatibility problem. I couldn't finish it and no one else at the table wanted more than a sip.  Started in 1981, SN's Celebration Ale secured the status of a classic, MJ's 1999 ""Guide."" MJ commented about the hop experiments... but did not rate it because of those changes. Celebration is listed in the ""1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die,"" it deserves to be there... but not based on my recommendation. This is a hop-head Celebration, less joy for Malt-head Nation.  While my rating improved slightly from 2016, I'm glad to pass on the balance of this bottle to my nephew who is helping us decorate the Christmas tree. I doubt I'll have this Celebration again, but I will keep count @ UnTappd.  Despite having 17 beers from SN, I don't think I've done a micro-review on SN (since I drank most in 2016 and earlier, before I did micro-reviews.. and because of SN's hop-heavy style doesn't encourage me to repeat.) Nonetheless, I'm glad not only to improve my rating for Celebration, but also review their website and acknowledge SN's leadership in the craft revolution and their impressive business success. We also should celebrate SN's continuing experimentation (636 beers retired!) and SN's steadfast independence after four decades, a rarity and perhaps singular today. All of which explains my huge Overall Hugs for a beer that makes me pucker. Nonetheless, Cheers to the hoppy Northwest !",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,brewandbbq,4.2,"12oz bottle.  Pours amber with an off-white head. Lacing aplenty and solid retention. Candied pine in the nose with citrus backing it up. Medium bodied with a slickish, tacky mouthfeel. Bitter and piney on the palate with sweet malt underneath. Citrus and pine bark. Finishes with a lingering bitterness and resinous pine.  A great beer but the sweetness from the Crystal malt keeps me from have more than one at a time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,dtumminelliob,4.56,"This might be my favorite Christmas beer. To handicap that statement, I'm not a big fan of spiced beers. That said, the wet hop on this is spot-on with a nice, almost vegetal piney-ness that is wonderfully fresh. The look is a little light, but probably to be expected. Other than that, a fantastic beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,do_ob,4.18,"A solid, all-around IPA, regardless of the subtext, calling this a ""winter beer"" or whatever. Light-medium golden in color with a big ol' fluffy white head.

140,1904,Bonkinishwa,4.18,"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. - Celebration Ale. 6.8% ABV. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Packaged on 10/19/15.  Look: Settles a hazy, deep red/copper color, with an impressive two finger off white head that slowly dissipates into sticky lacing.  Smell: Some floral hops, citrus, pine, malts, and caramel. It also does seem to have a somewhat spicy aroma like cinnamon, but since it's not brewed with spices, I have no idea what it's from.  Feel: On the lighter side, relatively smooth and creamy with a little carbonation.  Taste: Some light hop bitterness and bitter pine up front, but some sweet malt and caramel appear. The aftertaste is reminiscent of honey graham crackers.  Overall: This is a good change for a winter beer without all the spices (not saying either is a bad thing). This keeps it simple with hops, citrus, pine, and malt.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Foyle,4.43,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into tulip glass  Appearance: pours a 3"" pillowy off white head that falls very slowly and leaves abundant lacing behind. Color is cloudy reddish-amber. Aroma: strong pine and citrus dominate but there is an evident malt in the background. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, viscous and quite sticky with a quite dry finish. Flavor: fine balance between the hop notes with a bready-sweet malt. Overall: extremely well done.

140,1904,papposilenus,3.52,"From a 12oz. Bottle, dated 11/03/15. Obviously, I forgot to look at the date.  Pours a deep medium-hazy copper with a scant finger of creamy head, decent retention and gobs of lacing.  Smells like apple juice... apple juice? Apparently so. Otherwise, the nose is very faint - some yeast, honey, something vaguely floral.  Tastes better than expected after three months. From the nose, I had expected sweet malts but what I get is undifferentiated bitterness at the start, with black pepper and balsam following and, finally, the apple juice taste which, I guess, must be the underlying malt shouldering through the fading hops.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, mouth coating and amply carbonated.  Overall, should I even be rating an elderly IPA? Well, yes. Ultimately SN is accountable for it's chosen distribution channel and the fact that I will never, apparently, get to try one of their beers before it's died of old age. I bought this bottle as part of a mixed sixer with five Smuttys that had all been bottled within the past two weeks.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,ABVmeansnothingtome,3.52,"This beer looks great in red with a thick foamy yellowish head.  Smell is dare I say vomity.  Turning off the nose at this point but the taste follows.  Feel is far to refined for a Michigan beer lover.  In fairness I gave one of these to a friend in an effort to get rid of them. He reported back that it was DELICIOUS caps lock on in his enthusiasm. I have a few left and will experiment with temperature and glass shape but I felt obligated to review this because the score is so far from what I tasted here.  I love most of SN's IPA's. Perhaps I got an old six pack. Top shelf under the bright lights of a 24 hour Walmart. Last warm back washed swig just now tasted great, but who has time to wait. Gonna try my next one at room temperature.  If you want a solid ABV in a reddish IPA I say you should sniff around a Safety Meeting. ;-)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Brian_L-2056,3.69,Pours a very nice deep golden orange color into a typical pint glass with plenty of off white colored head. Very good carbonation. The smell is much like their Torpedo but more settle. Initial taste is surprisingly smooth for being hoppy. The bitterness does not build up at the finish like many IPA's I've tried lately. The Lacing is very good also. Overall I feel that this is another solid SN brew that I would be glad to drink more of.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this brew's head is 2 fingers thick and off-white, with solid lacing, and a clear reddish brown body.  I smell a nice blend of the pine and citrus hops mentioned on the label.  Tastes pretty much just like the elements described above, with a very small malt sweetness. Very drinkable!  The mouthfeel I'm picking up is clean and smooth. No lingering hop oils.  Overall, I'll award Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale - Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. with a very solid 4.5. Definitely pick this up during the season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Appearance: It poured a clear dark copper colour with a two finger cream coloured head that had great retention and left lots of nice lacing.  Aroma: Citrusy lemon, apple, piney hops and sweet but slight biscuit malts. There was also some herbal and spice here and there.  Taste: Light citrus and hop bitterness before it kicks in with some strong maltiness and surprising booze but nice spice.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  Overall: This was definitely more malty and boozy than I expected (and not in a good way). However, I will retry this again to make sure, but at the moment, I definitely prefer Hop Hunter and Torpedo IPA over this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Perfect for colder winter conditions.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BottleOfPills,3.65,"Poured from a bottle into a I guess a standard pint glass. It was a cold bottle, produced a small head that quickly dissipated. Dark coppery in color.  Smells citrusy, smells pretty good in my opinion. Maybe I can smell the pine like others below, but isn't pine kind of a citrus smelling scent??  Taste - I'm not typically a season type of beer person. Most beers I taste it seems like we're throwing all kinds of seasonal spices in the mix just because we can. Yes there are some that stand out for me and Seirra Nevada's Celebration Ale is going to be one in the future. It's pretty damn good. I like the grapefruit flavors that take over at the end. The malt is there and some hops of course like any IPA, just not over powering like some I taste. Then you throw in just the right amount of seasonal spices.. This is pretty damned good.  Mouthfeel is like all my other reviews if I like that crisp carbonation I give it a high score, and this beer is definitely crispy and plenty of carbonation if that's your thing.  Overall this is a pretty damned good beer - least that's my opinion - I would say it's easy drinking and heck would be a session beer for some of my friends. I hate to knock it because of the looks and smells but otherwise I like it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,HotDogBikeRide,4.04,"Poured from a chilled, single bottle, dated 10/01/15 (it is now 1/7/2016). Purchased at a local HEB here in Beaumont, TX. Normal glass, nothing fancy.  Pours a rich copper with minimal foam or lacing to be seen. Smell is very muted, with the slightest malty, nutty, pine hints - along with some barely detectable biscuit/cracker tones. No citrus as the label suggests. Taste - almost exactly like the smell. Well balanced but also very conservative hop touch on the end. Where this one shines is in the mouthfeel, quite sessionable and easy to put a few back, I'd reckon. You'd have me fooled with the alcohol content, I swear I can detect a buzz before I'm done with the glass.  Overall a Very reserved, safe beer. Probably too reserved for many. Wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to purchase again given the amount of options available, especially as far as IPAs go. I must admit I have only tried maybe a half dozen IPA's, I am quite a new craft head. However I also would never turn it down if offered. I personally prefer something more exciting, but it was nice to give a try and widen my experience with the style.  Cheers and happy new years!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Marraybay,2.8,"Look: Attractive gold color; decent lacing; No significant head formation.  Smell: floral-pine hops and citrus  Taste: The 1st small sip or two produced the fleeting ghost of some malt and spice perhaps, but the tsunami of grapefruit flavor that presents almost immediately, just annihilates any such presence overall. Just really extreme citrus that lingers on the palate: (If you momentarily disassociated yourself from the realization that you were drinking beer, you'd swear you were drinking grapefruit juice). It felt stronger than a 6.8% ABV.  Feel: Full, nicely carbonated.  Overall: I had this many moons ago before becoming a craft aficionado, so looked forward to revisiting. In spite of the amount of press & +reviews this beer continues to garner, it just didn't work for me. In the end, just not enough depth and nuance in flavor--holiday or otherwise--to counterbalance the massive tidal wave of citrusy hop bitterness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,BrokenEdge,3.93,"I was a tiny bit disappointed with this. It poured (perhaps a bit too vigorously) a reddish brown color with a colossal 3+ finger, cream colored head that never quite went away, beautiful beer. It smelled a lot more hoppy than I thought it actually tasted. The taste was much more malt, roasted nuts, and booze with dry bitterness mostly on the finish. Between the color and taste, this seemed more like an amber ale...which I love, but I was expecting much more hops than I got. I would drink another one (or six) for sure, it was a solid brew, but I didn't think it was quite worthy of all the hype.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The look of this brew put you in the hoilday sprit. The smell of this ale is rich with hops, grins, and malts. You also pick up a hit of spices and sweetness in the smell of this brew. The taste of Celebration Ale, is rich with flavors. You first pick up on the hops and spices in this brew. Then you pick up on the smoothness of grains and malts. There is a lot going on in this brew. Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale , has a nice balance to it there is nothing overpowering about this brew. I like how this brew is different from most IPA's on the market. This IPA seems to be smoother, not saying that is a bad thing. The mouthfeel of Celebration Ale is, rich, bold, smooth, clean, spicy, and refreshing. You really can't pick up on the 6.80% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. Overall, I'm giving Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale a 4.75 out of 5. This was way better than what I was expecting.

This is fairly hazy as well.  Smells: It smells slightly tart and citrusy like from fruit and hops. There's an earthy aroma that smells woodsy.  Taste: Kicks in with bitterness that is pretty powerful. It quickly moves to an earthy funk that you can't quite describe. At first is seems like it has went bad as it is a strange and unexpected flavor. It fades rather quickly and kicks into sweet malty flavors. It starts to get bitter once again and the funk seems to come back. As the flavors fade, you are left with citrus / pine / bread and malt aftertastes.  Feel: Light side of medium on the mouth feel. Not thin and a bit slick. Stays fizzy which is quite nice.  Overall: Decent IPA. I believe that hops used for this (wild ones?) gives it the funky flavor. Tastes like they threw in the hops, the vines, roots, and dirt all in this one. Very earthy. It is ok to drink a few, but I don't see myself buying a 6 pack or a 12 pack of it. Worth a try though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Myotus,4.15,"Poured at 45°F from a 12oz bottle (packaged on 01Oct15) into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Consumed on 30Dec15. LOOK: Pours with a finger and half worth of dense, off-white foam. At 20 seconds, the foam head becomes rocky and spacious. After 3 minutes, the head has not yet begin to even dissipate. Amber in color with a moderate amount of cloudiness. There is a massive amount of both small and medium-sized rising bubbles that would explain why the foam head refuses to die. Lacing is moderate and both thick and very thick. SMELL: Strong aromas of mango, papaya, peach, and apricot entangle with mild aromas of piney hops, grapefruit, tangerines, and subtle aromas of buttered bread and caramel. There is also subtle aromas of dirt, not earthy hops, but straight soil. TASTE: Mild flavors of piney hops, grapefruit, and tangerine enter initially and are immediately followed by mild caramel and subtle bitter hop flavors. Mild mango, papaya, apricot, peach, and buttered bread flavors enter lastly as all previous flavors persist. FEEL: Somewhere between full-bodied and medium-bodied. Carbonation is moderate. Goes down smooth and creamy. Finishes with a strong dryness. NOTE: An exceptionally balanced and delicious American IPA.

S: Evergreen and herbal notes dominate the nose, citrus presence and grapefruit.  T/F: This a pretty big hop bomb for a non-Imperial IPA. Biscuity malts keep the beer grounded, and serve as a great platform for the hoppy goodness of this brew. Pine and spruce mingle with herbs on the hop profile, with subtle citrus flavors in the background. Medium in body... easy, easy, drinking, and a nice crisp clean finish.

140,1904,Antg8989,3.75,"I don't really understand the hype over this one. It's a fine beer but to be getting scores in the 90's doesn't make much sense.

140,1904,Steve_Studnuts,3.92,"Nice fluffy head that starts leaving lacing almost immediately. Beautiful rings of lace form as you drink it down. Scent is a bit muted for a fresh hop IPA. Swirl it around the glass a bit and it brightens up to reveal mild citrus and pine atop mellow caramel undertones. Taste leans toward the piney. Creamy, fuller-bodied mouthfeel stands out, making this wicked sippable. Good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DoreenAndDave,4.19,"Beer is a clear dark amber, with a nice dark ivory head. Some nice lacing. Aroma is lots of pine with a bit of bread and orange.

Some hop aroma may have been lost since I am drinking it almost 2 months after bottling day. But nonetheless, the aroma is piney and malty. It smells pretty dang good. A little weaker than I expected. But the taste is great: malty, bread, and decently hoppy. A little citrus, but quite a bit of pine, which I love. The finish is fairly dry. Carbonation is pretty high, but good. Overall, this is a great beer. The bitterness is perfect for the style.

Aroma is mostly citrus and malt: orange and grapefruit with equal parts caramel and bread. Flavor, too, is perfectly evenly balanced, with citrus notes being immediately balanced by bread, crisp bitterness being immediately balanced by sweet caramel and malt. Full body, smooth. Incredibly balanced brew here. I don't care much for the huge grapefruit-y citric hops, but I can't deny the appeal to those who do, nor the perfect execution of the balancing malt.

Overall a delicious, sweet malty IPA with a pure, fresh pine needle bitterness to cut through and balance out the sweetness. Perfectly balanced and simply well made. Really great beer!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ajchocholousek,4.24,"Aroma: incredibly fresh, incredibly green (in a good way), herbaceous, resiny, grassy hop character. Apricot, peach, strawberry (?), pine, and grapefruit make for an incredible hop bouquet. A touch of candied orange peel here too as well as just a bit of nice, warm malty sweetness to support it all.  Pours a deep red-orange amber color. Hints of darker brown. A nearly white, tight, dense, frothy head sticks around and leaves beautiful sticky lacing. Nearly perfectly clear, with a bit of haze, presumably from the hops.  A hop-forward palate brings a very resiny, sticky, piney, citrusy hop character. Pine, grapefruit, orange rind, and a bit of spruce greens prevail. It is medium bodied, with medium carbonation, and a very middle-of-the road, slightly sticky mouthfeel. The malt body comes in at the very end with just a touch of dark caramel and a bit of biscuit, but mostly stays out of the way. I get the tiniest bit of roast here as well - chocolate malt for color perhaps?  Overall this is a phenomenal beer. This year's is a bit more balanced in years past, but the complexity is through the roof. It goes down easy, but leaves you satisfied and wanting to crack another and another. Love the sticky lips.

140,1904,morrisseywilde,4.25,"It is just not Christmas/Holiday time until I get a 12 pack of this. My second favorite SN after Hop Hunter, and maybe my first due to the limited release and those fresh hops. A beautiful orange copper color with a small head. Aroma is pine, grapefruit, melon. Taste is crackery, pine, plum, plenty of hops for any hophead with just the right malt balance. Love that this is a winter beer that is not heavy or too malty. ABV is just right. Mouthfeel is thinner but substantial, refreshing yet with some heft to it. This is one of my favorite beers that I always come back to, and I always associate it with a special time of year. Comes with that amazing Sierra Nevada value.

The hops are piney and citrusy with floral being prominent.  Taste: It has flavors of nuts and a hint of caramel with the pine and floral flavors taking over the majority of the flavor sensation. The are hints of dark fruits as well.  Feel: It is medium bodied in texture with a bitter knock on the palate that is long lasting, but enjoyable.  Overall: it is a medium bodies IPA with the malt more reminiscent of an English IPA. It has complex hops flavors with a long lasting bitter finish.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,SaltofOH,3.43,"Bottle dated 10/07/15. DFH Tulip.  A: Remarkably dark for an IPA. Looks like an amber ale. Pours a hazy amber with just under 1 finger khaki head that fades to pretty much nothing. Moderate carbonation. On a second pour, retention was much better. Lacing was good, but not great.  S: Grapefruit and sugar. Very sweet nose, some resin and pine. Smells like a malty IPA, but not really getting much complexity.  T: Initially a dry and malty arrival, with some pine. Mid palate fills out with resin and slight sweetness, closing out with a very firm and lingering resiny bitterness. Bitterness really lingers. Very traditional resin/pine hop character; not much in the line of tropicals or citrus on the palate for me.  M: Heavier side of mid-weight, but with little viscosity. Lighter carbonation.  O: I first had this been knowing nothing about it, and drank it from a nearly-three-month old bottle. I thought it was an okay, hoppy brown ale. Now knowing that it is a holiday IPA (and having it a lot fresher) I can see why it has the cult following it does. It comes off to me as a low-alcohol DIPA. But I am a fan of maltier beers, so I like it and would certainly buy it again. Just not an annual must-have beer for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste: The flavor is somewhat malty upfront, but quickly yields to the robust hoppy bitterness you would expect from a longstanding IPA favorite. There is a pleasant level of spiciness throughout, it's just right for this variety of seasonal beer - definitely not overdone.  Feel: The bitterness from the hops lingers for a while, but doesn't make this beer any less drinkable; nice carbonation and very smooth.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Tee76,3.56,"As far as an IPA goes this is exceptional. Great lacing, great taste, very drinkable. My only complaint is its marketed and sold as a winter beer.

A: Clear, amber appearance, with a small, fluffy head. A couple rings of lacing are left after a few sips.  S: Hop-forward nose with a citrusy, floral bouquet. I just went through a lot of fresh-hop brews from the September harvest, adn this smells very similar.  T: The hop essence defines the flavors but it's floral, grassy and nuanced rather than bitter. NOtes of green apple and citrus rind are countered by honeyed biscuits and toasty grains. There is some bitterness toward the back of the sip, joining a touch of warming alcohol. Closes with a medium finish, with lingering bitter residuals.  M: Medium-light complexion with an oily slick mouthfeel.  There's good reason everyone clamors over this brew this time of year.

Pours a nice transparent orangey-ambery colour. About a full finger head (pointer finger, not pinky). Some decent lacing building on the sides just from the head, haven't even moved the glass yet. **About halfway through the beer and there is still a misty foamy .0001 inch head on top. I love it when beers can pull this off. Ive noticed some of Sierra Nevada and Deschutes beers having this ability.  The nostrils pick up grapefruit, orange, pine, apricot, plus a wash of sugary malty goodness. There's actually not a strong aroma accompanying this ale, but I concede that this could be due to the style (fresh hop) and the time spent in the bottle.  First couple of sips are met with a lemon zest and grapefruit blockade. I know grapefruit is probably the most overused describer of IPA's.. but it is front and center for this celebration. With warmth, I start picking up a some caramel, some buttery biscuits, beechwood, and anise.  I love the body and mouth-feel that is the result of whole cone hoppage. It's like every nook and cranny inside my happy little cheeks (you know I mean face cheeks...come on guys) get the creamy yet bittery goodness. Landing on a 6.8% abv, it's a little stiff for me and needlessly heats up a would be remarkable feel.  I have had this beer for the past several years, but this is my first time reviewing it. Like I mentioned earlier, this review is from a beer that is almost two months old. While that may not be a big deal for most styles, I believe it does affect a fresh hop ale. It was still really really good. Celebration is one of the most accessible and well rounded fresh hops you can get. I wouldn't have minded the alcohol being tuned down just a tad. Otherwise: celebrate hops, celebrate tradition, and celebrate good beer.  Happy Holidays",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The smell features pine and floral hops; not a lot of citrus. The taste follows the nose: bitter, piney, with light citrus, and subtle malty sweetness at the finish. This is a light, crisp, refreshing ale and very drinkable at 6.8% ABV. This is a great ale to enjoy outdoors, at a sporting event or with a nice meal. It is ideal for tailgating!

140,1904,exposd,3.38,"This is a different take on the normal traditional holiday Christmas ale that we see all the time nowadays. It's simply a fresh hop IPA brewed seasonally for he holidays and it really is a good brew for the season, but it doesn't have the spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. that most Christmas ales have. It's refreshing but also a beer you could enjoy in the cold winter and savor the flavor of the fresh hops, the first hops of the season to be exact!

140,1904,JLaw55,4.5,"Exceptional is the first word that comes to mind. I know an IPA can't necessarily be 'balanced' as far as beer is concerned, but this is the best way to describe this one. It is possibly the most balanced IPA I have ever had.  The color is a rich vibrant red/amber color. You can still see through it when you hold it up to the light, although just barely. A nice finger of white fluffy head. The aroma is that of pine, fruit, and malt.  The flavor is amazing. Layers of malt, citrus zest, pine, floral hops, and a bouquet of spices. It really tastes like the holidays in a glass. The malt is so supportive that the malt and hops really do dance on your tongue in harmony. Neither overpowering the other. The hops are still present and contribute a nice fresh profile to the beer, but they do not overpower or punch you in the mouth either.  Mouth feel is surprisingly light for a beer of this color and depth. It is very drinkable and smooth.  This beer is awesome. it isn't like all the other fresh hop beers out there, it seems like a labor of love and something that took a great deal of time and care to brew. Not like some of the options out there that seem like the hops were thrown in and it was bottled and shipped out immediately. This seems more like a beer that was brewed slow and steady, but still showcasing the fresh hops in the process.

140,1904,mirp1,4.48,"Celebration Ale is one of the first holiday beers ever released in the U.S. I first had it many years ago, and was blown away by it's classy simplicity. It struck me as an in-your-face, rock solid craft beer, having no intentions on faking anyone out. I looked forward to it's annual November release, and not just for the quality of the beer, but also for the striking holiday-winter theme packaging. Like many reviewers, I have had all kinds of beer over the years, from EKU 28, to Scaldis, to Heady Topper, Pliny the Elder, Ghandi Bot, Hi Res, KBS, Bourbon County Stout/Barley Wine, Bells Hop Slam/Mars, Seeking Alpha, Flower Power, Creeker, etc, etc. Consequently, my palate is conditioned to not be as impressed as I was with the more regular craft beers of the world. When I was told last week that Celebration Ale was now in stock at local beer stores here in Utica, NY, I quickly went out and grabbed some. Modern holiday beers have become spice crazy, and so have jumped the shark. Celebration Ale is that rock solid holiday craft beer that never sold out.

Taste is similar but sweeter & more intense with bready & toasted caramel malts imparting a toffee sweetness that is dominant over the orange, pine & black tea like notes of the hops which lasts beyond mid-sip but finishing with a nice full bodied balance of malt & pine/citrus hoppy bitter-sweetness which rockets forward aggressively to become a very bitter aftertaste.

Taste: There is a noticeable hops flavor, as expected from an IPA. There is good bite from the hops along with other flavors like citrus. There is not much sweetness from the malts.

The aroma is moderate in intensity: fermented pineapple over a nice blend of pine and dark florals, with more subdued caramelly malt notes. The flavor is a bit more strongly expressed, but still pretty modest for the style: moderately bitter pine, pineapple and spicy citrus over a very apparent, slightly caramel bready malt foundation. The finish is hoppy: pine and floral notes, followed by the onset of a very bitter, amazingly resinous clinging piney bitterness that coats the tongue and the roof of the mouth, lingering for a good while. The mouthfeel is biggish for the body, and the texture is moderately creamy and faintly peppery from the soft-for-style carbonation.

Great lacing you expect with most SN beers.  AROMA: Pine is the main scent. Caramel malt. Citrus is there, orange, grapefruit, lemon.  TASTE: Grapefruit, lemon, pine. Plenty of caramel/toffee malt. Balanced sweetness and bitterness throughout gulp. Finishes with a pleasant bitterness.  FEEL: Nice carbonation brings out flavors. Medium body, dry and refreshing.  Really nice IPA, first time having it. Similar to Flip side Red IPA, but better. Can't go wrong with this. There is an amazing balance between sticky sweet caramel malt and pine/citrus hops. Lingering! Will be back for more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Wer34truh,4.07,"Dark amber color, with a one-finger head which retains quite well - especially on the sides. Moderate-to-low carbonation.  The nose is dominated by a lot of citrusy pine-flavors. Smell is clear and striking, but not necessarily bombastic.  Piney hops dominate the taste, with the citrus making an appearance in the aftertaste. As with the smell, the taste is characterized by balance.  As with most Sierra Nevada brews, it is the price point which really makes this a great purchase. I would be willing to pay a lot more for a six-pack worth of this than its $8 price tag. Just like Torpedo IPA, this is a rock-solid beer for any price point - while potentially being one of the best beer-for-buck options on the market.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,pinyin,3.98,"Celebration 2015 bottled on October 30th.  Served 38F into a 16 ounce goblet.  Color is probably the best feature of this ale. Dark bronze, with little to no translucence. Typical Sierra Nevada carbonation.  Smell is very fresh and clean, but not a huge aroma here. I understand that this recipe is almost 40 years old, so I would assume no dry hop schedule used. On the nose I smell some light hop aroma, and a big bready malt scent.  Taste here is good, but nothing earth shattering or breathetaking. Very well balanced and the hops do not outshine the malt backbone. A little on the sugary side. Not a very big fan of the hops blend used here though.  Mouthfeel is a little bit thin, slightly watery and doesn't quite match the color.  Overall this is a very solid ale in terms of balance and freshness. I get that it is the original hop season harvest Ale that every other brewery seemed to copy. I just don't seem to have the same level of nostalgia for it that many others here do.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Buck89,4.18,"Poured into an IPA glass. A striking copper-amber color, moderately hazy, with a thick dense soapy light tan head that lingered for a long time. The aroma was surprisingly muted to me, with some pine straw, orange, and bread. The taste was huge as expected, with pine up front, followed by orange, grapefruit, bread and biscuit. On the bitter side even for an IPA but beautifully balanced by the malt. Clean bitter orange finish. Medium bodied with a really great feel, anticipated with the foamy head on the pour. Another masterpiece from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,thebeers,4.18,"Reddish amber color with thick brown-tinted off-white head and good lacing. Pine on the nose, with some citrus in the background. They carry over, to a lesser extent, into the flavor, pairing with some biscuits-and-caramel malt up front, and heavy hop bitterness on the back end. I remember years ago when the hops in this beer seemed like a (delicious) assault on the taste buds; today it comes across as pretty well balanced compared to many hop bombs. Somewhat light-bodied, but with a creaminess to it. A winter classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Wiffler27,4.43,"pours a deep dark red / almost red-brown color with a thick white head. the head subsides slightly but a solid white head remains, even after 30 minutes! great looking and lively beer.  smells like sweet roasted malts. a slight smell of sweet hops exist but it is not prominent in the aroma.  the taste is fantastic, nice combination of grapefruit and toasted malt. not overpowering but very solid. goes down very smooth, easy drinking!  overall this is a pretty good IPA, nothing mindblowing but it does everything right. not overly hoppy or malty, utilizes a few different tastes.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RockRuler,3.95,I had read all the hype and wanted to try it for myself. Bottled 10/14/15. Fresh. Good hop smell and sweet malt taste but not too malty. Not very bitter.

140,1904,Glengosch,4.82,"I seem to remember this beer being called Celebration Ale in years past, now it's called Celebration IPA, and hey, IPAs are all the rage, so why not call it that? But on to the taste and stuff...  *Taste - The flavor of this beer is primo, superb, deluxe, fasmatasmic - or some other word that is better than good. Seriously. One of my favorites. In a blind taste test, I don't know that I would know that this is an IPA. Normally with an IPA, (a good IPA) I am punched in the face with pine or floral citrus (and I don't mean that in a bad way). This here ale is the perfect balance that makes it almost unrecognizable in the field of American IPAs. Maybe it solidifies itself ahead of the rest.  On the back end, it's like you get the bitterness without the burn - if that makes sense(?). I guess what I'm trying to say is the taste is as pleasant as the minimal aftertaste.  You get a good balance of maltiness too. Bonus.  As far as taste/flavor is concerned, it's hard to find better.  *Smell - it smells great, but I taste the hops more than I smell them.  *Feel - it feels good. Smooth. Easy to drink with a high ABV.  *Look - Amberish/goldenish/a little darker than a Sam Adams BL (for your reference)  *Overall/bottom line - Depending on what I'm in the mood for, probably my favorite beer. Great hop taste, balanced with some (great) malt taste. Do yourself a favor, if you like beer, and drink this. You're welcome.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TheWolf,3.79,Amber copper nice fluffy head. Piney aroma with pepper and holly. Taste consistent with nose. I agree with a prior reviewer with the torpedo analogy. Sort of like a spiced up torpedo. I like it better than last year.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jzeilinger,3.94,"On tap.  A - Pours a clear copper amber color with a massive creamy white frothy head and moderate carbonation.  S - Citrus and pine aroma with minimal malt and a touch of light spociness. (Poured on tap and the serving temp is a little colder than usual so some of the aroma has been muted initially).  T - Minimal toasted malt presence with hops taking the front seat in the glass, pine and citrus abound from start to finish. Grapefruit, lemon rind, and lingering citrus pine bitterness to wash away any toasted malt on the palate. Bitterness is sharp but perfectly done.  M - Solid medium body with some carbonation pickles on the back of the tongue.  O - Haven't had this beer in awhile and it's better than the last time I had it (which was a few years ago).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

And a hint of tang, and dry.  feel: medium.  overall: a six pack of 12 oz bottles was $9.50 + tax and it's not available all the time so for what it's worth (to me of course) I would have to say that I wont pick this up again. To me it taste a lot like the sn pale ale not much difference but the color? It's drinkable you are not going to get any off flavors in this but it won't knock your sock of either, with lagunitas born yesterday being also available right now I think that I will take that over this.

This years version strikes me as exceptionally balanced and highly drinkable.

140,1904,TLWalsh,4.33,"Pours a golden copper color, persistent creamy milky head. Definite citrus piney aroma. Has a complex balanced flavor, both malty and hoppy. Has a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Finishes peppery, piney and grassy from all those hops. This stuff is delicious, I'll be looking for some more as the season goes on.  Just poured the 2016 edition into my favorite tulip.

Surprised how little of a nose I was getting. Taste is hops, caramel, toffy, a little pine and citrus. Some bitterness on the back end.

This years version was somewhat of a let down.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Sheppard,3.64,"Pours a copper, reddish amber hue. The head is between cream and tan. Light aroma of citrus fruits. It's got a very creamy feel with tempered earthy spiciness, especially on the finish. While it's a distinctly west coast IPA, it doesn't destroy the palate. It's pleasant, but it doesn't really have distinct or outstanding qualities. It's a very good option and value for something you can find in your grocery store, but it's not comparable to the elite IPAs that we see nowadays.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: also similar to Estate ale, sweetness and creaminess up front, fades to a nice earthy bitter bite, smooth around the edges and finishes crisp  F: creamy and smooth to start, bitter and crisp to finish, lingering bitterness on the tongue  O: one of my all time favorites, a killer amber IPA, Sierra Nevada rarely fails to impress (or do they ever?)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Look = 4.5 Pretty, deep amber color; 1 finger of thick off white head with great retention and lace. Great color. Aroma = 3.75 Very balanced, way more than I expected.

I can almost pick up the fresh hop “spice” notes everybody claims they get with this. Taste = 4.0 Also balanced; follows the nose. Sweet candy malts lead the way with pine hop notes providing some balance. Mild bitterness on the finish. Feel = 4.0 Medium bodied with high carbonation. Crisp and fizzy, a little resiny. Good for style. Drinkability = 4.5 Easy drinking, very balanced IPA. Overall = 4.0625 A true classic IPA.

140,1904,doktorhops,3.66,"Sierra Nevada are like the Tiger Woods of beers - they play a sharp game of golf, and cheat on their Swedish wives... err, no, that analogy doesn’t work, how about Sierra Nevada are like the J.K. Simmons of beers - consistently undervalued for their work and quietly brilliant, plus they won an Oscar that they thoroughly deserved (or at least they would if there was a beer equivalent of an Oscar). I’m happy with that revised analogy. Now on to their Celebration Ale - this is a Winter Ale with a difference - all IPA, no spices. This will be awesome-sauce.  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: Cloudy toffee brown-tinged amber body with a sticky 1 centimetre off-white head. There’s a decent amount of protein in the head, Sierra Nevada have got to be happy with that, I know I am. 9/10.  S: Malt forward with a biscuit/caramel combo, followed by hints of piney/citric, it’s certainly not as big on the hops as Torpedo, we’ll see how it comes out in the flavour because sometimes you do get big hop flavours in brews without big hop aromas. In Sierra Nevada we trust. 7/10.  T: The good news: This is one smooth IPA. The bad news: Sierra Nevada’s own Torpedo IPA scuttles this brew [nautical puns anyone?] with hops, more and more HOPS! Palate-wise SNaCA (as I am henceforth calling this beer) has a big caramel/biscuit base with hints of pine/citrus hops and a rather sharp bitter finish on the edge of your tongue that carries through to the aftertaste. This needs more hop flavours and less hop bitterness (which is entirely possible - my last homebrew was all tropical hop flavour without bitterness). 7/10.  M: Medium bodied, slightly oily hop presence with a light but dense carbonation. Almost the exact same mouthfeel as the Torpedo. 9/10.  D: Missed opportunity from the makers of the mighty Torpedo. This is a fresh hop IPA that has bitten off more than it could chew - too malty, not enough hop flavour, unnecessary sharp bitter edge, above-average aroma. Those are the negatives, on the plus side it is a hearty, smooth and half decent IPA, I guess I’ve been too spoiled with Sierra Nevada’s other offerings (oh yeah and Founders, Deschutes, Ballast Point, the rest of the west coast, et al.) to give this a higher rating. [err, best before: 10.24.14... disregard my ENTIRE review now!] 7/10.

140,1904,Libeertarian,3.82,"I'm drinking and reviewing this a little late in its life, but it was well-stored and is a sturdy brew, so bear with me. Dark, hazy, amber in color with rocky, inviting, yellow-tan head that retains so well I'm having trouble pouring the rest into my glass (more than a film all the way to the end). Smells like oranges, then raisins or other dried or candied fruit. I also was just barely able to notice the caramel. Not very strong aromas in this IPA. Mild hop bitterness, grapefruit, citrus rind, caramel, and again raisins on the palate. Generally I would associate this last sensation with aging, but I think in this case (as in a number of other beers) it could be a combination of the hops with the caramel of the malt. Slight black pepper notes, also. Mouthfeel is as expected, a little stiffer and stickier than water at first but fizzing up and smoothing out if not swallowed too quickly. Overall, not a bad beer, a great one in fact, but overrated, not that I have any complaints. I say that having had it a few times when it was younger as well, enjoying it, but not being astonished.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,ARoman,4.48,"*transferred from old notes - 1/1/2014* 12oz bottle poured into a stemmed tulip. There’s a sweet, roasted aroma that emerges from the pour almost instantaneously before my nose was anywhere near the glass. As it settles, pine and citrus notes become noticeable, as well as a very faint trace of chalkiness. The creamy, foamy, egg-shell white head lingers for awhile and laces the glass as it recedes. The beer itself is a hazy, bright orange (pumpkin color) with noticeable particulate floating within. At first sip, it starts out with a heavy hand of hop bitterness that gives way nicely into a mild sweetness and a more subtle bitter quality. It’s mostly a crisp beer, but not as dry as other IPAs - there’s some stickiness to it which blends nicely with some malty richness at the swallow. There’s also a pleasant warming effect to it to go with the above average carbonation. The aftertaste lingers for a bit mainly consisting of pine and resin with some toasted malt flavors. Nothing about this beer jumps out as ""Christmas-y"" as the name might hint at, but I don’t get the impression that’s was Sierra Nevada was going for - definitely a pleasing cold-weather IPA to keep warm with.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,JohnnyI,4.46,"What better way to ring in the New Year than with a 2014 Celebration Ale? Cheers! Oops... In my zeal to enjoy this one, perhaps I got a little carried away. My aggressive pour created a towering 4-finger head that overwhelmed my IPA glass and cascaded down to the countertop. Sweet precious ale, what have I done?! After squeezing the last ounce in the glass, I was left with an ice cream float-like head. Ample lacing crowned the deep, hazy, nectar colored liquid. I took a few moments to admire the robust and beautiful garnet-amber hue before diving in to the nose. It didn't take long for the potent scents to waft upward. Spruce pine and juniper mingled with a sweet grapefruit citrus and hints of pineapple. Reminiscent of the fresh bed of pine straw that falls in my yard each Autumn, with a zesty citrus flare. There's an underlying bread crust in the nose that struggles to compete with the floral and perfume-like hops. The flavor was a vibrant hop explosion. Earthy, herbal and fresh. Ruby red grapefruit. The caramel malt backbone also stands tall but struggles to support the alpha acids. To call this balanced would be a lie, but the malts are noteworthy and serve to further illustrate how incredible the star of the show really is. All of this is delivered with a rich, chewy mouthfeel and creamy carbonation. I've run out of adjectives. It's simply delicious and represents the high-water mark for American IPA's. Sierra Nevada continues to impress with their admirable ales and the West Coast sure shows us how it's done. Happy New Year Beer Advocates.

The color is a deep garnet color and is on the cloudy side.  Smell- Pine overules, with a the citric nature of the hops punching through. Pungent.  Taste- First, there is a sweet malt that comes through, with a toasted biscuit quality to it. This lasts for only a second, as the bitter pine-like hoppy notes begin to descend on the palate. Complex, as citrus notes mix with the pine undertones. Hints of grapefruit and mango add to the sweetness. The bitter finishes lasts until the end and lingers.

S: Mainly aromas of piney hops with some floral hop varities coming through. A bit of a faint grain or bread smell also.

Half-finger white head that sticks around a bit. Pretty good amount of lacing.  Aroma: Pine, orange peel, citrus, hops.  Taste: The dominant flavors here are pine and orange peel. Tasty IPA with nice hop bite.  Mouthfeel: A tiny bit on the thin side for an IPA, but not in a problematic way.  Overall: I don't get what's ""Christmas""-ish about this beer, but it is a fine IPA.

140,1904,Stoutanddark,2,"Having lived on sixth street in Chico ca when Sierra Nevada first opened its brewery, am positive the hops being used are nowhere near as good these days. Very piney and bitter . The hops drowned out the malt leaving bitter beer face.. Some like the piney flavors however would prefer to taste some malt backbone to round out the flavors.  Also seems quickly brewed , not allowed to develop and bottled before its due time. A trend with big name brands that have to push out volume under deadlines.  World Class? Bros are usually pretty dead on however would strongly differ on this one.  Good enough to drink if offered by a host but would save my legal tender for something more celebratory as the $8.99 a six pack is expensive for the quality here.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The contrast in the different styles knocked our palates for a loop. It gave us a fresh start for the evenings festivities. A palate cleansing experience. Did our afternoon of tasting influence our assessment of this brew? Perhaps, but it awakened us to fuller appreciation. This is one fine ale. A beautiful balance of flavors. The hops played beautifully on top of the malts. We toasted one another from opposite ends of the dining room table.

There's little tart/sweet in the taste.. it's earthy/hoppy/piney/resinous/tree-barky. Some bitterness towards the end, but finishing cleanly, with a bit of sweet tree-fruitiness. Wish just a little more of that fruit flavor came through the taste. M: Full-bodied, well-rounded, mod carb O: I've never drank this beer and felt wintery/warm/holiday-cheery (as the snowy cabin picture would suggest- perhaps a 'cinnamon and roasted marshmallow stout' comes to mind, but I digress..), however, I suppose it's definitely more pleasurable than the typical citrus-forward IPAs around this time of year.

A: [3.75] Initially I got malty breadiness. Some sweetness from the malts. After a second sip I started to pick up a little more bitter on the back end.  A: [3.50] Slightly elavated carbonation. The beer itself nice. Good mouthfeel.  A: [3.50] If I was handed this glass and asked to say what was in it I would guess a nice craft lager. It has all of the qualities of a really nice lager.

I've also heard good things about their porter, but the only beer that I've had from them that I think is truly excellent is Celebration Ale.  Celebration Ale is great for what it's not. It's not a hop bomb and it's not a thin beer that lacks flavor. It's a perfectly balanced IPA that has a smooth, slightly caramel malt flavor that integrates perfectly with a nice hop punch. Two other great things about this beer.  - The freshness of the hops really add to the flavor. - The price for such a solid IPA can't be beat  This year I bought a case of it and wish I could have a celebration the whole year round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A mid-level scent that is warming and leads to promising thoughts about the taste.  Taste 4.0: Front is slightly dry with very appealing malts. Middle is slightly sweet, but very smooth with a big hit of grassy, piney alkaline hop bitterness. Finish is where a delicious caramel/brown sugar hint sneaks in along with more resiny hop deliciousness. Aftertaste is smooth and slightly sweet with one more delicious hint of hop bitterness.  Feel 4.25: Amazing mouth feel. So smooth and satisfying.  Overall 4.0: Just a really fantastic beer. Certainly not perfect, but much better than 90% of the commercially available beers out there.

Lasting head, impeccable lacing.  Smell: Nothing crazy here, somewhat subtle aromas of pine, citrus, and a hint of biscuit.  Taste: Biscuity malt, backed up by a healthy dose of pine/grapefruity hops. Perfectly bitter and, with no real hint of alcohol, this beer demands more sips. The finish is pure fresh hop cone, notably Cascade. Not what I'd call a balanced beer (balanced is boring anyway), but there's a great interplay between the malt and the hops that many of the latest IPAs lack.  Feel: Prickly in all the right places, bitter where it counts.  Overall: There's a reason this is a classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Just to differentiate this is Fresh Hopped which is different than Wet Hopped. Great explanation of that on the Sierra Nevada landing page for celebration.  With wet hopped I think Hop Trip or Chasin Freshies from Deschutes. Here, with the Fresh Hops its like drinking an excellent fresh brew from a brewery's tap room.  Still delicious.

Appearance: Copper, nigh amber in hue. Puffy, dense white head, substantial lacing. Cloud of particulates makes the beer softly opaque. Sparse little bubble colonies make their way to the top through the golden haze of hop particulates.  Smell: Sweet grapefruit, hint of tin, bready malts, fruity ester, bit of spice, hint of pine. Very round and aromatic.  Taste: Letting it warm, the flavors just explode out of the glass. Grapefruit hop burst mingles with masked biscuity malt up front, leading to a pure sugar pine and sweetbread wave, washing into a grapefruity, bitter hop finish. Pine and grapefruit rind on the tongue in the aftertaste. Alcohol is quite present in mid-to-late stage of flavor. The balance is superb, especially after about 10 mins. of warming.  Mouthfeel: Full body, alcohol noticeable. The almost syrupy heft is balanced by the fuzz of middling carbonation.  Overall: Good lawd. I remembered it was good, but not that it was THIS good.

Hop flavors difficult to pick out. Bitterness with no personality. Not quite piney, not quite citrus, no florals. Nothing pronounced.

Its an IPA and i love most other Sierra Nevada beers so I think, it should be something special. After all it is a ""Celebration"" seasonal been and should be something special. I get it home, eager to try, pop one in the freezer hoping I haven't just bought a case of duds. Well, on my first try I am underwhelmed, in fact disappointed. The copy on the side of the case says ""fresh hopped"". I think that means at the very least a Hoppy experience like Torpedo (which I love and maybe that's the problem). It also says hints of citrus and PINE?!, Well if it were me I wouldn't use the word pine in copy about beer. Save it for the Potpourri at thanksgiving and Christmas.. and sure as hell leave it out of beer. The first taste in your mouth isn't bad.... then you get the after taste. If you want to say pine.. id say more like turpentine. Its not heavy its sort of a thin processed alcohol taste that's bitter, but not the good bitter an IPA should have but worse.

Smell: My biggest take from the smell is how clean it is- the smell is just nice crisp citrus hoppiness without being too overpowering on a similarly crisp and clean maltiness.  Taste: I finally understand why people go nuts for this IPA. It's truly quite world class, easily one of the best I've had. The biggest impression I get from this beer is how balanced it is for the style- everything compliments each other. The malts provide a nice core to the beer and enough sweetness to balance out the hops, while the hops provide a strong assertion of bitter citrus fruit and some herbal spiciness. Really marvelous.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with good carbonation. I'd like to see the carbonation turned down half a notch in this one. This beer on cask would be godly.

Side poured with standard vigor from the bottle into a Sam Adams glass.  Appearance - Pours a beautiful copper hue with a small, half finger head that dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing. Cool packaging for sure. The color is the most impressive part of the presentation.  Smell - Pine, grapefruit, and citrus notes are the primary, as is the case with most hop heavy beers. However the hops do not smell overwhelming on this one, which is nice. A slight presence of bread and malts in the background  Taste - Much like the nose, very smooth and well balanced. Malty backbone reinforced with some hoppiness, but not too much. The pine, floral notes are again the big display on the palate.  Mouthfeel - Finishes very clean and smooth, probably one of my favorite parts about this beer. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, hint of hop bitterness on finish.  Overall - This is a good beer.

Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wet hop IPA. All around great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,enjambed,4.5,"Serving: Fridge temp bottle poured into hefe glass (I need a tulip)  Look: Deep, dark copper, that's nearly brown at some points, but still somewhat transparent. Moderate pour produces a big off-white head that settles down, but persists all the way. Lacing is quite high and lingers forever.  Smell: fresh pine, citrus, grapefruit, and floral notes are abundant and dominate the aroma, with bready malts lingering in the background.  Taste: Like biting into a big, juicy grapefruit, and leaves a bit of that 'puckery' feeling in the mouth. Pine is also present. The malts are almost non-existent, but that's okay here. This is a hop showcase and it does it's job well.  Feel: Medium, but leaves a sticky finish. Carbonation is bubbly but not prickly.  Overall: Celebration is a wonderful seasonal IPA and I don't even care if it isn't balanced.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,TBoneJones,4.45,"I'm glad I actually read the writing on this red 6-pack; I nearly passed it up thinking it was a winter warmer (which I don't usually seek) or something, since hopped beers tend to favor the green colors. Love this brewery's beers, yet never tried/ knew of this. Glad I caught myself. Pint pour: A very hazy apple cider color, with plenty of active carbonation, a rich-looking body and a fluffy off-white head. Lacing ends up caked along the sides..(and a nice white foamy plate of head stayed while this was completed). Smells like light pine and citrus hints, but mostly I pick up malts on the nose. This is nice. Immediately drinkable, this has hops of pine and toasted, biscuiy malts. Some grapefruit/ spicy mint too. Hop oils. Simple yet superb. It doesn't feel like much carbonation, yet it drinks well and has a medium-bodied feel to it. If one was looking for an ipa that fits in with the winter/ holiday season, with straight-forward and not overdone hops, and a nicely toasted backbone, this brew will do it. I could see this drinking well from the bottle. Bitter, yet well-rounded overall. Enter winter.  Update: Almost 2 years later and I pick up this six pack as I see it appear for the season. It is the good stuff. The review is my impression, but it's just so drinkable for what it is. So full of flavorful hops and velvety smooth. Grew on me since the last time.

Light lacing traces around the top and falls nicely. The smell had a sticky piney ebb and flow of lingering lemon underneath. The taste was mainly bittersweet, fully combined and it lead to a nice bittersweet aftertaste and a sticky finish.

140,1904,Cory_Brown,4.25,This is my first time having this seasonal selection with an enhanced palate. Last year I tried this and thought hmmm... What's all the hype about? But now I get it. This beer is dangerously drinkable for an IPA that clocks in at 6.8%. It's perfectly balanced with malt and hops. I mainly get pine in the taste but it's very pleasant and lingers on the tongue. I think it's the wet hops that keeps your mouth watering and wanting more. This beer is great and I will definitely look forward to it for years to come.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Dark but clear amber with a one-inch head. Plenty of carbonation to boot, too.  S: Very good. Piney, lemon, grass and grapefruit but also some lightly-kilned caramel malt. A good balance of malt and hops.  T: Can taste lots of pine and grass from the hops, and these flavors are backed up by a nice amber malt backbone. Very toasty.  F: Great.

Mild to moderate, gripping (but still well integrated) bitterness carries from the middle through the end.  M: Medium body and medium-high, sharp carbonation that serves to accentuate the bitterness.  O: An old school, fairly tasty, but non-traditional IPA.

I should not have given the Kilkenny as high of a score as I did, I may adjust that. I also feel like beers that are overly hyped tend to fall short. This is a good beer, but is it as good as people say it is? Probably, because its solid and very reasonable in price. Is it spectacular? Not really. Its above average and that's about it for me. 2014 Release. I am almost certain I have had this one in previous years and it did not leave a huge impression on me.  Appearance: Beautiful, reddish bronze, head began pretty large and then settled into a nice froth layering the top.  Smell: Kind of boozy, some floral notes, and sweet malt.  Taste: Balanced. Not as sharp on the hops as you would expect considering its a fresh hop beer. I think the malt sweetness takes the stage and crowds the hops out a bit. They are there but not nearly as pungent as you would think.  Overall: I have had this one before, it didn't leave that big of an impression on me and honestly its a good beer, but not as good as the hype you read on the message boards would lead you to believe. Its worth seeking out, its cheap for what you get and its seasonal. It would be a great hoppy ale for those gateway drinkers.

140,1904,samtrillo,4.1,"The first sip is the best one. The balance of the beer really comes to the fore. It's got a strong carmelized malt backing that is aided by the bitter hops. The hops do have a bit a of a grapefruit and pineapple thing going on the middle but fade to pure bitterness at the end. It's a bittersweet, fruity and full experience.  I have to say I enjoyed Lagunitas's Fresh Hop Bomb 'Born Yesterday' more than this year's Celebration just from the hop flavor profile alone.

I am about to embark on a Xmas beer taste test and I have this one lined up against Avery, Deschutes, Great Lakes, Southern Tier and will grab one more to make six. But...I have had this over the years and it is absolutely fabulous. Why? Dark Copper Pour, tastes is consistent in draft and bottles which is something to be commended on, great hop smell but also notes of spice, full bodied happiness but with a clean finish, and just the right amount of APV. This is not an ordinary IPA, but symbolic with the colder weather and holidays. I had a few left over and had over the summer, and while the beer held up, it is not a good fit with hot humid summer days. Save this tasty beverage for the season it was meant to commemorate.  I am not a professional reviewer, and do not really know how to express how something tastes like so many of the excellent reviewers here. I will say once you savor the pour, the smell and that first taste you will know you are embarking on something special. The body is full, but not too full, the hop characteristics reek of freshness but the beer is also balanced. It is a big beer...meaning after about 3-4 it is time to move on.

This is such a classic and I personally find it to be the prototypical American style IPA that does everything right. There is plenty of hop flavor and fresh aroma but is well balanced by the malt bill. It still stands up well to all the new beers since its first release.

Taste - Like nose, blast o' hops up front, pine resin and citrus rind-like, slightly fruity, a bit of that yeasty, alcohol/estery floral spiciness drops in, bitterness is fairly assertive and astringently drying. Mid-palate: wonderful caramel-bready malt presents itself with a perfectly balancing sweetness. Finish is quite dry, and a medium-strong, drying, pine-resin bitterness and flavor coats the mouth. This beer screams ""balanced"" to me, even with the pronounced bitterness.  Feel - Smooth and creamy medium body feels well...medium; not too light, not too heavy, and seems to suit this beer nicely. Well carbonated - a treat to sip on.  Overall - A truly hoppy IPA, fairly bitter and strong, yet manages to feel extremely well balanced. The fresh hops (not wet hops...freshly dried hops) really pop in this beer with a lot of complexity, yet the smooth malty backbone provides just enough sweetness to balance while letting the hoppy star of the show shine.

It's funny, Sierra is putting out at least a dozen different IPAs a year these days, and aside from slight variances, they're all pretty much the same beer. That's not a bad thing necessarily. They're all good. But I'd like to be surprised once in a while. I think I might prefer the Boomerang IPA that just came out in their Snow Pack, but what's a little bit of a surprise in this one is that you can taste the malt profile a little more than usual. Some good caramel and toasty nutty notes in there. Of course, the hops lead the show. But I might go so far as to call this a well balanced beer. The thing I'm curious about, and perhaps someone could help me out here, is that for the past several years they've been referring to the Celebration Ale as an IPA, but I'm all but convinced that ages ago their Celebration did not always fall into the IPA category. I wish I could go back in time and crack a bottle in 1990 to see for sure. There's a lot of other things I'd like to do if I could go back to 1990, but that's a story for a different website.

The beer poured a clear copper color with a nice 1½-finger creamy white head on top. Retention was good and it left some really nice lacing on the glass.  Great smell. Lots of citrus and lots of hops.  I was surprised at the amount of sweet caramel malt in here, but it was needed to tame all the hops. Citrus and pine hops with lots of grapefruit , lemon, and pine flavors along with some peaches for some added fruit.

Appearance- The color is nothing less than what you would expect, it looks like regular Sierra Nevada Pale ale but I feel like Celebration doesn't poor with such a good head.  Smell- Malty more than citrusy  Taste- Really good for what it is, not an everyday beer.  Mouthfeel- Lacking fullness, would be better with a slightly more velvety mouthfeel to match the unique malt flavors.  Overall-  I have and will continue to buy this beer when the mood is right. I give it a 3.5/5.  Give it a try; Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Phigg1102,4.42,"Deep amber color with one finger of white foam that clings to the glass throughout. Citrusy hop aroma with heavy pine . Less citrus in the taste but the pine remains with a great deal of floral taste as well. The floral quality reminds me of why I fell in love with IPAS.

140,1904,ChristopherWIU-UTPA,4.45,"It pours golden copper, but turns a vibrant golden color, and has average head, with decent carbonation and little lacings. It has a lasting aroma of hops that hangs in the air after the pour, the taste is of hops, citrus, and rye, with notes of caramel. It has nice bitter taste, light body, has a hoppy after taste, and feels good on the tongue. Fantastic beer...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Thick white head that eventually fades down leaving a little bit of lacing  S - Fresh citrus hop aroma. Very unique as far as hoppy goes.  T - initial grapefruit, citrus that leaves behind an earthy finish  M - Very smooth indeed. Just the right amount of carbonation. No dryness.  All in all a fantastic beer on a cold night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Growlerguzzler,4.68,"This is one of my favorite beers. Hoppy, fresh, floral. A great value.  If you are an IPA fan, you'll likely love this release.

140,1904,Dsimenson,4.22,"Poured from a bottle into a New Belgium goblet. Nice off-white head and lovely lacing. The color is unfiltered medium amber. The aroma is really wonderful--citrusy hops predominate. The flavor is rich, delightful, strong hops balanced with malt. Mouthfeel is medium thick, with fairly strong carbonation. Overall this is an outstanding ale, different than Torpedo in character, but defines truly from the same family. TMZL below does a much better description of this ale. I just love it!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tmzl,4.36,"Look: Pours with large, creamy, billowy, medium sized bubbles, off-white (light orange hue) head. Slow, sticky retention with big bubbles collapsing creates a creamy, medium sized top layer that leaves random, sticky lacing. Clear, golden amber with light haze particles. Golden like sap from a pine three on a fresh summer morning (some poetry shit).  Smell: Some fruity feeling, mostly citrus (grapefruit) and rich pine with light grain and stronger caramel medium light sweetness. Also some floral notes. Refreshing, cleans your nose. Not flashy (which is a good thing in this case).  Taste: Light sweet lemon start to solid malt backbone in the middle, mostly light caramel medium sweetness, connects everything well. Ends with satisfying medium bitterness, pine all the way with light caramel sweetness. Sweetness and bitterness (mostly bitterness) linger in your mouth for a while, teasing you to make another sip.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, good carbonation (light crisp), makes it a bit lighter, fresher but still smooth enough. Light dry finish.  Overall: Pine goodness, doesn't joke around, knows what it wants and delivers. Everything as it should be, some would call it boring but the strong pine driven character with solid caramel backbone does it for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Karibourgeois,4.06,Clear amber pour with a slightly off-white head and a good bit of lacing. Aroma of pine and caramel with a hint of orange.

Bitterness builds through to a nice lingering finish with some pine flavor.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,VTBrewHound,2.9,"12 oz bottled ""packaged on 10/02/2015"" Consumed 11/06/15 Pours a nice, clear Amber color with a frothy, rocky cream colored head. Not any aroma detected. Slightest hint of malt. Now, the taste to me is very one note, that note being bitter, very bitter. No fruit, no pine, no earth. The malt is nice in the mouth feel, but is overpowered by the bitterness. Maybe if I had it on 10/6 rather than 11/6?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Grugalug,4.13,"Poured into a pint glass.  A- Pours a copper color with a large 1.5 finger head that lingers for quite some time. Somewhat hazy and not a ton of bubbles rising to the surface. Either way looks tasty.  S- Quite big on citrus, most notably grapefruit with some other citrusy sweetness. Slight pine and earthiness as well. Smells refreshing.  T- The complexity of it takes you by surprise. Starts out quite citrusy and sweet and the hop bitterness bites back with some abruptness. The pine takes over at the end with a considerable bitterness as well, although not as bitter as I expected it to be. Also, while the malt is subtle it is present. Again, very refreshing, and the alcohol is not present at all.  M- Well-carbonated and even a bit spritz-like. Body is relatively light. Goes down quite smooth.  O- While the smell is somewhat underwhelming, the taste is much more intense and pleasing in my opinion. For 65 IBUs, very drinkable. If you aren't keen on IPAs, this one probably won't change your mind, but it's a really solid offering and it should be a must try for all those that do go for IPAs.

140,1904,BigGold,4.03,"Have had Celebration nearly every year starting in 2012, usually poured from bottle or can, and on draft for the 2019 and 2020 releases.  Pours a nice deep amber red, with clarity and a creamy 1- to 2-finger very light-tan head, with great retention, leaving a thick coating of lace. Sweet but significant and refreshing piney aroma, then as warms developing florals, some sharp stone fruit, and finally a hint of mild caramel malt. Begins with significant carbonation and piney hop bite, then moderate, somewhat sweet caramel, before a clean, moderately bitter, piney finish.  Pretty beer, with a classic piney and floral aroma, deft malt, and a bracing finish. A favorite every single year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jazzyjeff13,3.67,"A 350ml bottle with a BB of Oct 2014. 2013 vintage. Picked up recently from Trembling Madness in York. Described as a seasonal fresh-hop ale, this is a classic that I've been waiting to try.  Poured into a Duvel tulip. Bottle conditioned. A hazy reddish-amber hue with visible sediment and medium carbonation. Yields a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a while before slowly reducing to a patchy surface layer. Some lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt with hints of pine resin, weed, subtle citrus peel, earthy yeast and mild stewed hops. A bit like SNPA on steroids.  Tastes of intense aromatic hops and caramel malt, with a stinging bitter finish. Notes of pine resin, dank weed, grapefruit, citrus peel, stewed hops, sweet caramel and earthy yeast. Possesses a strident, spicy bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with pleasant carbonation and good body. Quite astringent, followed by an aftertaste of pine, bitter aromatic hops and caramel malt.  Rather nice, if not the paradigm shift I was hoping for. Looks great, and the aroma is well balanced. The flavour is OK though the pine-laden hop character lacks depth. Decent body. A characterful brew that goes down all too easily. Worth sampling if you have the chance.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A beefed up Pale Ale from the folks who make quite possibly the best PA around. The smell on this beer is amazing, hops, fruits, pinecone/pine needle(did I mention piney) type smell. The head on this beer is like a fluffy marshmellow cloud, one of the best heads on a IPA I have ever come across, really superb. Lots of hops, this brew has its bitter side but it is matched in equal with malts and whatever else they are using...fruit, spices, crisp on the palate with a warming alcohol lingering towards the end.

Wonderful. Magical, even. T-This bottle cant be that fresh, and yet it tastes amazing still. I get pine, citrus, floral, earthy... its all there. The malt sits nicely in the middle somewhere. I wouldnt call it balanced, but its there. I would absolutely LOVE this on tap. It brings me back to my roots in craft beer, this is one of the first real ales I ever had. It is well designed. There is just something about a ""fresh hop"" ale. I havent ever brewed a fresh hop ale yet, but I see it on the horizon... Sierra Nevada has never disappointed me. I look forward to each burp lol. M- This is such an easy drinking brew, so smooth. I would like it to be just a touch thicker, but thats just my opinion. Overall, this is a solid and fantastic beer. I hope that someday I can brew something that matches the caliber of this masterpiece. If you dig hops like me, and you havent had this beer, then you need to try it.

140,1904,Das_Reh,2.79,"After hearing how popular this was around the holidays, and considering the recent cold snap, I figured it was worth purchasing the last 3 bottles of this winter seasonal from my local shop.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  A = Deep copper colored beer, darker than most IPA's I've had. Very good 2 finger head and nice, sticky lacing.  S = Nose is full of pine and some sweet malts hiding in the background, maybe a touch of grapefruit.  T = This is SN Bigfoot all over again... very green, pungent, bitter pine, with the malt struggling to let you know it's there to cut through the intense bitterness, albeit barely. There is a hint of warming alcohol as the beer warms. Dry and coats the tongue in bitter pine. I'm not a huge hop-head like some of the other BA's on the site, but I love a good IPA/DIPA. However, I prefer citrusy and fruity/floral over grassy/piney hop characteristics in my bitter beers, and this beer is overwhelmingly piney in my opinion. I have come to the conclusion, despite having tried only 7 of SN's offerings, that I am not a fan of their PA/IPA's, as they all taste similar in my opinion and lack balance. Not many beers make me cringe and shudder with each sip, yet every PA/IPA I've had by SN has... they're not bad beers (look at the ratings), I just don't like the way they're crafted. Taste is subjective, as I always say.  M = Medium, smooth mouthfeel, somewhat thick for an IPA but not syrupy or heavy.  O = I have 2 more bottles of this, and I'm going to struggle to get through them. I should have bought one to see if I liked it first, now I'm stuck with 2 beers I don't care for very much. If you're a big hop-head or love big, piney IPA's, then this beer is for you. However, if you're more like me and prefer your IPA's to be fruity/citrusy, this may overwhelm your palate as it did mine. This IPA left me wishing I had bought Jai Alai or Two-Hearted instead...

A hint of grapefruit.  T - A clean crisp snap of hop, with some marginal sweetness, but quickly dominated by grapefruit pith and bitterness, closing with full hop bitterness with undertones of citrus.  M - Moderate carbonation leading into some drying in the finish.  O - So this is what all the noise is about. An exciting seasonal that gets deep into what an IPA should be. Perhaps a bit surprised that the citrus is not more forward, since that would seem a natural given the season, but this brew manages to impress without overwhelming.

140,1904,LambicPentameter,4.02,"Enjoyed on tap at Bier Station in Kansas City on 12/21/2013, so I'm reviewing from notes. This is the 2013 edition and it was served into a small Belgian tulip glass. My second encounter with this annual seasonal IPA, the last being 2012. I figured I'd actually write a review and update my score from the last time I'd sampled it.  Appearance - Body is a beautiful, jewel-like golden amber color with rich reddish orange undertones and some bright safety orange highlights where light passes through the slight haziness that permeates the liquid. Atop the body sits a two finger head of flour white that dissipates after awhile and leaves nice translucent sheets of lace as well as some faint rings as I drink it down. A very attractive beer.  Smell - Predominantly pine and herbal notes, but with some nice acidic grapefruit and citrus to give it some brightness. But there is also a noticeable graininess that lend some meat to the otherwise hoppyful aroma.  Taste - Grass and light pine, with some herbal bitterness, like citrus rind. The up front hoppy notes are balanced with a nice malt presence, with some notes of light caramel and fresh pretzel bread, and is that some woodiness in there, hiding in the background? Perhaps that's the pine again.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied, with a pleasant chewiness to it for the style and ample carbonation to give some effervescence to the feel. Aftertaste is slight lingering bitterness.  Overall, a fantastic fresh hop ale that I've enjoyed both times I've had it. This will definitely go onto the list of seasonals that I seek out each year.

What Sculpin is to juicy fresh, Celebration is to wintery, harvest, indoors, wood fire, slightly damp foods, aged and smoked. 4.25  T: Follows the smell, with aged, smoked over tones to an otherwise familiar powerful IPA profile. Like Torpedo from the spring house or the cellar. Thick bread crust spread with pine/rosemary/marmalade. Finishes powerfully smokey/ bitter.

140,1904,archyquaffer,3.88,"Poured from the stubby bottle into a sampler. A moderate pour brings about a 1/2 inch frothy, off-white head. This proves moderately sticky, leaving a big island of foam in the middle and wisps of lace along the sides. The beer is a ruddy golden brown with light carbonation.  The aroma is surprisingly subdued, with light floral hops and hints of sweet malt. The flavor itself is fairly hop forward, but not overly so. Plenty of citrus and pine tones without completely overwhelming the malt flavor, which manifests as a general caramel and bready sort of base. Some lingering bitterness on the tongue which is a bit more earthy than the other hop notes, and lends almost a nutty flavor.  This is a very balanced and hence easy drinking IPA. It makes a nice sipping-session beer, which I am enjoying on the final weekend of the NFL regular season. This beer complimented very well with hot wings and a variety of other foods.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CTbrew32,4.32,"Appearance- Dark orange-red, amber color with very little visibility through the glass. Pours a two finger pillowy/soapy white head.  Aroma- Very big on the pine aromas with a little bit of citrus sweetness as well.  Taste- As the nose indicated this is big one the pine flavors which is big upfront and reemerges in the finish as well. Towards the middle the pine is balanced out citrus and orange fruit flavors along with a mildly sweet caramel malt. Finish is rounded out by slightly toasted malt and the pine bitterness as mentioned before. As far as the ""spice"" goes if I hadn't read up on it already I think I could have confused of the piney flavors at the end for being spice.  Mouthfeel- Medium bodied with an almost chewy mouthfeel. On the bitter side as first but as it warms up the malt helps mellow out the big bitter pine flavors. Clean finish and highly drinkable.  Overall- It's easy to see why this beer has held up for several decades. Great mixture of pine/citrus flavors and a malt that's just sweet enough to make this beer work.

I have since given up a search for something to replace Great Lakes Christmas Ale, Three Floyd's Alpha Klaus, and Thirsty Dog's Twelve Days of Christmas. Even though Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale is a Fresh Hop Ale and has nothing to do with the style it is very nostalgiac for me. I remember driving to Munster, Indiana with my best friend and finishing the night off with a Celebration Ale.  Ironically, even though I am aware of the style I still detect other notes normally found in Christmas Ales, such as nutmeg and coriander. It must be the power of suggestion. As a Fresh Hop Pale Ale, this, just like Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale, is a gold standard beer.  It has wonderful citrus notes on the nose. A solid malt backbone, with light lacing on the glass.

There is some real good hop flavor in here, again follows the piney, resinous, spicy hops, along with some citrus as well, but there is some herbal/floral flavors here too, which I think is the freshness of the hops showing through. There is a decent malt backbone to this as well.

Taste is not as bitter as I used to think it was, as my palate has changed. Its got a good malt backbone with grassy, lemony hops and a lingering slight bitter aftertaste. good balance.  Feel is medium carb with middle of the road feel.  Overall one of my favorite session beers in the winter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

More malty aroma than I anticipated. Light hops in the back. Slightly earthy smelling.  T- Very tasty! Not overly bitter. Flavors of apples and pears. Slight citrus. Very nice malty backbone.

140,1904,walkinginplace,4.25,"This brew pours into a beautiful red amber color with a major white head. Once it settles, there is a lot of lacing and the white top remains. You can smell the hops and grapefruit pretty clearly with a significant pine smell coming through as well. Celebration feels a lot lighter-bodied than I expected with average carbonation. Finally, the taste is overwhelmingly grapefruit with some hops and caramel coming through as well. The bitterness of the hops really comes through at the end (honestly, it was a little more strongly than I would have liked). I can see why hopheads love this one but it's just a tad much for me. All in all, I like it but it's nothing particularly special when it comes to IPAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The aroma isn't all that strong lots of gooey hope character, mainly pine and resin with some melon and other citrus.  Tastes like a great hoppy IPA plenty of bitterness. Nothing real complex here its not that well balanced definitely hop forward. You do get some nice bready flavors from the bottle conditioned yeast still chilling in the beer.  Overall a solid fresh hop offering from Sierra Nevada the beer speaks for itself in so many ways go grab a 6 pack sit down by a nice warm fire and appreciate a well crafted brew.

140,1904,ZoomanCru,3.86,"Celebration – Fresh Hop IPA (6.8%) - Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. (California) ☆☆☆☆  App: Copper and gold brown with a little bit of haze and a really nice two finger white head that persists. Lots of sticky lacing coating the insides of the glass when the head finally collapses a little.  Smell: Mild, berry like tartness forefront in the nose complimented by light, toffee like malts. Hops isn't as prevalent as with some IPAs. But as this is fresh hopped, it's not unexpected.  Taste: Leafy green hops pungency dominates every aspect of this brew. Malt is definitely strong enough to hold up, as the hops never slap you out of your chair, but there's something about fresh hops that make them seem more complicated without necessarily being stronger. Foretaste is all hops, with a little bit of alcohol taste in the aftertaste. Could maybe use just the slightest more maltiness.  Mouth: Rounded body, with enough malt to hold up to the hops assertiveness. Well carbonated and easy drinking for the initiated.

Explosion of citrus with a hint of pine. Slightly bitter.  M - Medium body and carbonation. Feels light on the tongue. Finishes a bit dry.  Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. Even though it's their winter seasonal, it doesn't taste like it. I could enjoy this IPA on a hot day after mowing the lawn/going for a walk.

140,1904,Mongrel,4,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? A true classic beer that holds up great even in this age of intense IPA one-ups-manship.  Pours a beautiful amber-orange with a finger of soft off-white head and plenty of sticky lacing.  Smell is dominated by fresh pine. There's also a hint of dank, swampy hops, a little lemon and pear, but mostly just tons of pine. Very fitting for the holidays.  Flavor is fruitier than I recall, with lemon, lime, orange peel and a touch of tropical fruit. Pine is also prevalent. Obviously a hoppy brew, but there's also a warm, soft sweet side where you get just a hint of holiday pie spices like nutmeg, vanilla and brown sugar. Soft peach also mingles about. Beautifully balanced and evocative of the holidays in a way you don't expect an IPA to be.  Mouthfeel is full and soft, yet a little prickly with carbonation. Nearly perfect.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Steved9mm,4.55,"Yet another awesome brew from the folks at Sierra Nevada. It pours a beautiful clear orange color with a nice inch or so of head that has nice retention and lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass. The nose is a wonderful bouquet of hops, pine, and some sweet fruitiness. The taste is nice and hoppy the way I like it with plenty of pine and citrus notes and a great maltyness to bring the whole thing together. Mouth feel is medium light with strong carbonation and the taste lingers in your mouth for a while like a good ipa should. Overall this brew was a delight.

Yep!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BurgeoningBrewhead,4.31,"Poured into tulip; copper-orange, clear, with periodic big bubbles feeding a thick, fluffy white head. Head holds firm for a minute or two, then collapses into a chunky cap of foam that leaves spotty lacing as it breaks. Smells awesome, as soon as I opened the bottle I was already whiffing hops. Powerful hop aroma consists of dank herbal hops, along with pine and lighter citrus and other fruits. Taste is sweet malt balanced with a hefty dose of hops; pine and citrus rind, along with lesser flavors of earthy herbalness. Bitterness finishes it off in the aftertaste with some lingering malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth, finishes wet and sticky. Overall, another solid beer, and another solid IPA from Sierra Nevada.

140,1904,MarkQ617,4.59,"This is my fourth Sierra Nevada, had it poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Legit winter beer. Usually the winter beers are full of sugar and spice, but this one is just crisp and refreshing. You can smell the forest when you stick your nose in the glass, it's glorious. Lots of head just piles up as the glass fills. Pick up a case of these every Christmas just like decorating the tree or buying presents.

S - Pine and orange dominate on a background of subtle crusty notes.  T - Piney hops, citrus, and a solid malty sweet backbone stands up to it all and keeps the bitterness moderate and enjoyable, some spice on the finish.  M - Medium body, low end of medium carbonation level, lingering bitterness and a slightly dry finish.  O - While I'll agree nothing really screams ""holiday"" from this beer I find it to be a welcomed change of pace from the spiced beers of the season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Franziskaner,3.68,Serious carbonation going on here. I've got an inch thick head of off white foam. Good lacing. Copper brown in color and I can see it is unfiltered due to microscopic sediment within the beer. I get a whiff of pine like hops and light grains. I get a prominent pine like hop and citrus hop flavor at the front of the palate followed by a cereal grain backbone. The hops dominate and it is different to have the citrus and pine hops blended. The mouthfeel is a bit chalky and seems to pair well with the long fading bitterness.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ANIMOUL,4.23,"A sturdy offering that isn't necessarily a 'holiday' brew; despite the label and its seasonal offering. An above-average IPA that would be delicious on a hot summer day after a long run down a rattlesnake-infested trail in the mountains... I digress. Soft, piney notes with a balanced hop taste... I think.  Bought a box to store for enjoyment throughout the year. A solid beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Miketwolf21,4.44,"The original American IPA and the beer that turned me on to Sierra Nevada. I remember being at a house party some six years ago,finding a forgotten soldier and opening my palate to its hoppy orchestra.  A: Deep ambery-red filtered brilliance  S: Warm notes of rye vodka play with herbal and pine melodies.  T: Malty sweetness, is quickly taken over by waves of spicy notes of pine, tangerine, and thyme. Extremely deep bass line of resinous hop oils play on your tongue, having a grapefruit zest like bitterness and aftertaste. A comforting warmth emerges from within with each consecutive breath. A very clean yeast with minimal esters. The crystal malts never get a chance to expose any caramel flavors and are used mainly to add a balanced residual sweetness to the mix.  M: Medium bodied, with just enough carbonation to keep it tasting light on it's feet. Definitely not syrupy.  Definitely more Cohumulone than many modern AIPAs, with a longer, more bitter aftertaste. Spicy herbal notes being more predominate. Undoubtedly inspired Surly Furious, Town Hall's Masala Mama, and Green Flash's West Coast IPA.

I love fresh the hop in this.  T: Piney hop bite, followed by smooth bready/malty notes. Some bitter citrus on side of tongue. Yeast is hinting at minor esters. Very slight.  M: Medium filling. Creamy due to tight carbonation. Piney aroma on outbreath. Spicy hop bite on finish. Balanced a bit by malts.  O: Great example of American IPA.

140,1904,CowsandBeer,3.83,"12 oz bottle poured into a Tallgrass Brewing cervoise style glass at fridge temperature. Sipped on this while the cold wind blew outside. I’m hoping this will help me welcome in the holidays and winter weather.  Appearance: Pours two and a half fingers of creamy, off white head. An almost mahogany/cherry colored body. The body was also slightly cloudy from the sediment in the bottle. A good amount of lacing was left on the sides of the glass.  Smell: Pine, ammonia, spicy herbal and earthy hops up front. Some citrus and tangerine slice follows. Sweet malts poke out at the end. Smells nice and fresh.  Taste: Follows the nose with herbal, piney, and spicy like hops. After that a more citrus like hop note comes through. Then the malts come into play with a doughy, boozy maltiness. Nice finish of grains and crusty bread.  Mouthfeel: A smooth, full mouthfeel. Some warmth did come through.  Overall: A nice, seasonal IPA that does its job on a cold day. The highlight for me was the fresh, hoppy nose that evoked images of handfuls of hops. However, I was surprised by some of the heat that came through despite the 6.8% abv. In short a hoppy, slightly boozy and malty IPA that’ll warm you up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,anarchia,3.84,"Ruby-colored beer, fairly translucent, with a thick head that feels great when it hits your mouth. Aroma is basically all hops, mostly pine/grapefruit with some floral notes.

Foamy carbonation, thick & sudsy with a bitter finish. A better-than-average IPA for sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CMUbrew,4.01,"A: Orangy-amber-red color in the light. A nice rocky off-white head appears in the amount of almost three fingers on a fairly easy pour. Lacing very present early on in the glass.  S: Can't smell much at the moment due to some congestion, but I can pick up a little bit of citrus and maybe pine.  T: An excellent presentation of citrus grapefruit and orange rind and pine flavors blending very well. Sizeable bitterness permeates. Malt body adds little balance - this seems to be about the hops. Gets surprisingly boozy when warmed up.  M: Higher level of carbonation. Slightly oily feel. Good IPA body overall. A little too warming on the alcohol as it starts to gain in temperature.

Poured a deep copper color with an offwhite head or a finger. Smells of pine hops and sweet Christmas bread. I was rather surprised at the smell of hops with a brew that was 4 years old. The taste starts with some light hop bitterness, followed by the Christmas bread, honey, and dried fruits. Light hop flavor melds into sweetness on the finish. OK, but I prefer this one fresh.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

But, a remix of sorts. A ""red"" version. Inclusions of tart flavor such as maybe pomegranate. But then, wild spices swirl in: Ginger maybe, nutmeg. Customary pine is present. Soothing low malt backbone. Medium hops. The sweet notes and spice notes when combined on the palate remind one of say gingerbread. Grapefruit. A penchant Pale Ale infused, GENTLY, with holiday spices. More pale ale than a herbed/spiced beer. Taste is paragraph worthy describing.  M-Medium body. Soft. Creamy and foamy like a float drink. A true treat.  O-With every element of what makes a great beer great standing out, this is probably the best winter drink easily. Look, smell, taste and feel all embrace one another in harmony. Standout trait is the appearance. Looks better than most dark brown/deep red brews I've seen. The head is the literal ""Crowning Achievement"". At first sits high and mighty atop the maroon brew. With time flattens, but never leaves. An hour later, my finished glass still had a puddle of foam relaxing on the bottom. The lacing didn't stick to said glass, it would cascade down in a smooth waterfall-foaming fashion and collect downwards. If you're like me I drink every drip if I can.

It is a hazy orange color with sone clarity and bubbles seen coming up through the glass.  Smell: A nice floral bouquet of citrus and pine followed by some caramel and toasted malts.  Taste: Grapefruit, tangerine, a little orange, some resiny pine, mildly sweet caramel and chewy malts, and mild hop bitterness. Everything rolls and blends well together.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, a little chewy, a bit creamy, light to medium bodied, very drinkable, and low to medium carbonation.  Overall: It is great that this is a celebration of the 2013 hop harvest and that the freshness of the beer should be enjoyed before and during the holidays.

Finishes with more piney dry bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium, average carbonation, dry finish... make that very dry finish.

Upon the opening of the first bottle out of my 12'er, A huge blast of fruity / citrusy hops shot into my nose.  When pouring into my glass I noticed the familiar beige head that rises quickly to the top of my gass that soon subsides with some beautiful lacing.  And the taste was a very intense hop flavor, grapefruit from the chinook's, and the sweetness and spiciness of the Cascade's and centtenial's,only to be followed up by the rich malt character that is imparted from the use of the english malt's that they use, as well as the usual crystal malt's. Absolutey perfect... Rich, complex and extremely satisfying.  One final note on this brew is the fact that sierra product's almost alway's have a nice crisp carbonation that so mant brew's lack, and I miss. What happened to beer's that are crisp and satisfying, as so many other beer's these day's have the carbonation of a cracked open coke that had been sittting there for at least a day LOL...

Aroma is of super fresh, bursting citrus led by grapefruit, followed by a bit of pineapple and mango. Followed by pine resin and light notes of sweet caramel malt. Taste starts very hop-forward. The citrus is now mostly absent. The pine notes are strong, and the caramel malts are more present than they were in the aroma. As it warms, the citrus does reappear a bit, dominated by grapefruit and not much else. Although the hops dominate this brew, the rest of the flavors are very well balanced. Medium bodied. Good amount of carbonation. Incredibly easy to drink. I could down quite a few of these. Overall, a very solid IPA. Every aspect was solid, but I was hoping for a little bit more of an in your face result from the taste, instead of the balanced taste that it has. Not a fault, however, still a very good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Similarly, flavor of fruity citric hops with notes of spices, oranges, grapefruits and pine. Dry aftertaste with a long lasting bitterness. Light to medium body. Alcohol is harmonic with the overall beer. Beer with a bold flavor, but nothing excessive. A traditional and well balanced American IPA. Not sure if fresher would radically modify this, once it is available during winter (thus last year) and for some freaking reason most US producer hides this info.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Mango and pineapple are the bigger fruit flavors then you get some dank pine, a big bready malt, and a few other earthy hop scents. T - Flavor doesnt showcase the tropical notes in the aroma, and the bready malt is a big profile here, you still get some nice dank pine and some earthy bitterness. M - A little more on the drier side of things, but decent feel. O - I used to not like this in years past, but this year I'm good with it, the aroma is really good, and considering how long this beer has been around, its earned its keep.

The crispness and boozy strength that you'd want to keep you warm on a cold winter night  M - smooth and rich, perfect carbonation  O - Great alternative to the porters that are usually favoured around the holidays, by far my favorite seasonal beer.

140,1904,gr0g,3.97,"Copper in color with a healthy, blossoming head. Excellent retention and lacing. Aroma is a bit subdued for an IPA. There's more of an earthy character overall with some piney notes in the background. Celebration is all old-school C-hops and lacks the intricate, tropical aromas of the new breed of IPAs. Still, it has a vibrant, floral aroma.  The flavor does not disappoint. Hop blast upfront as the IBUs hit you. A mix of piney/lemony hop flavors blend nicely with the malt profile, finishing with a bit of lingering bitterness. While moderately dry overall, there's a toasty malt backbone that becomes more apparent toward the finish (seemingly a characteristic of all Sierra's IPAs). Slick mouthfeel with plenty of hop oils, though a slight prickliness from the carbonation detracts.  Very balanced/drinkable as IPAs go and an incredible value. Similar to Torpedo in many respects, though I definitely prefer Celebration... perhaps the ""specialness"" of the holiday release tilts my opinion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale I don't know if I'm seduced by the best label I've ever seen, but this beer reminds me of winter. Cozy, warm, and exclusive. Fresh hop? I don't know. Reminds me a lot of, well...every other Sierra offering. Malts are (thankfully) present, and well-balanced. You can taste the alcohol, but don't be scared. Strong hop bitterness only warms the mild alcohol presence. In my mind, celebration's achievement is in balance. This isn't a hop bomb. While the hops greet you initially, the malty smoothness leaves a strong residual sweetness. Taste. Warmth. Happiness.

I'm not getting as much grapefruit as in other years, either. M- lovin that smoothness you rarely get in IPAs  O- I love how this beer is a bit different each year. Not the best iteration, in my opinion, but very good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,joeworrall,4.02,"Tonight I'm reviewing Sierra Nevada 2013 Celebration ""Fresh Hop Ale"" against two solid IPA's: Lagunitas A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale and Firestone Walker Double Jack IIPA.  Maybe it's unfair to compare a seasonal beer with two solid IIPA's, but that said, that's what I'm drinking tonight.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass, Celebration ale is pale orange with a nice persistent head. THe aroma is a nice balance of spiced malts and citrus hops. Neither is dominant, but both are present. The aftertaste is crisp and the malts dominate, contrary to the IIPA's I am comparing it too.  This is a very quaffable beer, one that I look forward to each year from Sierra Nevada, and usually consume several six packs worth. But once it's gone, I don't miss it much, there are too many other good IIPA's out there that are available year around!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Benish,4.4,"Batch 2013. Poured into snifter glass.  Appearance: a light golden amber in color. Very presentable thick foamy head. It was quite dense, kind of like the foam that accumulates in the corner of the hot tub. Also spotty lacings around the glass.  Smell: a very nice earthy and floral fragrance. Not too complex or robust to the nose.  Taste: the hops are the centerpiece of this beer. Upon sipping it, I get earthy and woodsy flavor of the hops; not much malt present. Its dry from start to finish. The hops just lingers around the mouth the entire time. It's quite bitter but not over the top.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied mouthfeel, the carbonation is perfect.  Overall: This is really a simple IPA. Nothing is over the top and the hop profile dominates. This is what makes this beer so great in my opinion. Plus it is dirt cheap for an outstanding beer. Only 7-8 bucks a 6 pack. For someone that likes hops being the highlight, pick this up!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,greenboat,4.14,"A: Pours a crystal clear amber color with a 1.5"" head that quickly recedes to a pleasant skim. Very pretty!  S: Smell of fresh hops. Mostly pine and floral notes with a hint of citrus. A strong backbone of caramel malt is also present.  T: Very nice! Fresh pine and earth meld with subtle citrus notes. A hearty sweet malt permeates throughout the experience. A strong but pleasant bitterness lingers but does not detract from the experience.  M: Creamy and smooth, as can be expected from SN!  O: A classic that I look forward to every year. This year's batch does not disappoint!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,wjbaxteriv,4.07,"Ahh Celebration. An old friend.  Pours a dark lightly cloudy orange color with a lovely pale khaki head that fades to a thin cap. Excellent lacing like most Sierra Nevada brews.  Smells great with floral notes dominating. Some definite citrus notes. Pine represented as well. Well rounded hop aroma.  Tastes great, just like I remember, with grapefruit dominating the flavor profile. Malt takes a backseat, of course, but is very present with a light, caramel-like sweetness.  Body is very much as expected. Not too heavy, not too light. In the Goldilocks zone for IPAs.  A fantastic beer that I look forward to every year. Like most beers from Sierra Nevada it's all about balance and craftsmanship which is very evident. A welcome relief from all the over spiced holiday beers. Well done!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,pkalix,4.24,"pours a huge white head into a masonry jar with super cool texture.... peachy-orange in color lots of hop aroma, but kind of bland in smell from this mason jar. lots of hop taste. easy to drink, very smooth, medium bitterness. clingy suds on the side of the glass. generic, but decent; sessionable (?) if you're a hop drinker. otherwise, another notch on the BA list, but worthy of decent marks regardless of commerciality.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Huge piney, resinous flavor as well as light citrus zest, and a smooth caramel malt backbone.  Light-medium bodied, medium carbonation, resinous, piney, bitter, dry.  Overall, a truly exceptional beer and the low price point doesn't hurt.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Hops4Pops,4.46,"12 oz bottle  A: A very nice dark orangish amber color. Poured into pint mug. Unfiltered. I can see the goodies in it. Nice lacing after the head recedes. The lacing is not really sticky. Tiny tiny bubbles across the surface with a few big ones popping up. Looks great!  S: Nice smell with the fresh hops hitting my nose first and followed by balancing malt. In the middle are some citrus notes and a tiny amount of bread.  T: Fresh hops. Nice since I love hops. The flavor is one of the most balanced I have experienced for an AIPA. Finish is a very nicely done hoppy bitterness on the back of the tongue.  M: Feels nice and creamy with the hop bite well balanced out with the malt background.  O: I love this beer. This year is the first I have had it and I hear 2012 was one of the best. I plan to stock up on this beer to see how it evolves. If you have not had it, get some, its great for the holidays and colder weather and different than many of the darker stout type beers often presented during this season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dank203,4.25,"Complex; this year I'm getting an abundance of spices, even hot pepper. Last year I more remember a sour grapefruit note dominating. So its an ever changing beer, but the backbone has always been solid, the malt creates even a milky sweetness underneath the complexity of the hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MoMaMe,4.91,"This has become one of my new favorite winter ales and favorites overall.  It has a really nice color and lots of head (which I like)  The taste is very fresh and hoppy - bright citrus and pine notes.  Just a note... I tried the 2013 bottle. I highly recommend this one!  Update: I get this every year and some years are better than others. Well, something good finally came out of 2020... Celebration ale is on top of it's game this year... Extra piney and floral. Lots of foam and good retention. Keep it up Sierra Nevada!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Jekyll,4,"Been drinking celebration for years now. Never reviewed than again up didn't start officially reviewing until early this year(2013). While Sierra Nevada claims the recipe is the same year after year it is simply the freshest hops of the season that differentiate it there are subtle differences in the years. In my opinion of the past 8 years give or take, the 2012 edition is by far the best. This is however the 2013 edition and it is a solid brew. Pretty much outstanding across the board. No weaknesses and nothing that stands out. Just a solid example of what a fresh hop IPA is all about. The thing that amazes me and is rarely mentioned is the consistency of this brewery seeing as how celebration( to the best of my knowledge) is in all 50 states(57 if u are an Obama supporter) and for the brewery to maintain that awesome of a consistency with that volume of production speaks wonders. Amazing brew nuff said !",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PaulyB83,4.25,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. No bottling date.  A- Deep medium amber with a good high off white head, great head retention and lacing.  S- Orange, pineapple, pine and a big mellow bitterness. Slight caramel malt.  T- Yum getting lots of citrus and bitterness but not as harsh a bitterness as other Sierra Nevada offerings I've had. A nice lingering pine bitterness.  M- Medium not too heavy, not too light. Flavor and mouthfeel match perfectly.  O- A great IPA and reminded my very much of 3Floyds Broo Doo but I prefer this one. This is also very cost effective for the beer your getting. Getting a sixer for under 10 bucks is a mighty big holiday gift for sure.

140,1904,jeff1973,3.94,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Southampton Publick House pint glass. Bottled 10/4/13. so 7 weeks old at this point. Bought at Whole Foods Newport Beach CA for $8.99 for a six pack.  A - A dark honey orange. Eggshell head leaves excellent lacing.  S - Muted orange, peach, and a little cat piss from the hops. A little caramel malt.  T - The hop flavors follow the nose with that soft (not so bitter) finish that comes from fresh hops. There is a nice caramel/bready taste in the background. The finish drys out, but leaves just a hint of sweetness.  M - Medium with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Perfect for a great ale. Carbonation is medium to fit the creamy body.  O - Only slight flaw is the nose, but that is inherent in fresh hop ales. Taste is spot on with a nice balance between hops and malt. Not a hop forward west coast IPA, but a tasty one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,boybrew,4.42,"2013 Bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip glass  A - Light copper color, thick luscious off white head. Tight lacing, sticks to the glass all the way to the last sip.  S - Grapefruit, pine needles, floral, very resinous. Clean and lightly sweet malt background.  T - Light caramel from the malt backs a very clean bitterness. Bitterness lingers in a nice way.  M - Well carbonated. Very fine bubbles replenish the thick creamy head. Mouthfeel medium, very substantial. Alcohol pleasant and refined.  O - Sierra does it again. This is one of THE measuring sticks for American IPA. With all the extreme examples that have followed it's always nice to revisit the original.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Andrew041180,3.96,"At last, the renowned Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale.  A - I love the color. It's something of a hybrid orange/copper/amber color with a bit of intensity given the proper lighting. I had to control the pour a little to keep the head from springing up too much. Got it to about two inches where it retained quite well and left significant sticky lace on the sides of the glass. Slight haze, but quite clear.  S - Was expecting more here actually. I barely pick up anything. What I do get is primarily bready/toasty malt. I expected big hop aroma here.  T - Again, a bit of a curveball, but only in my expectations. It does reflect the smell. I get a grapefruit sensation up front that builds into a rounded bitterness. It's very comfortable and I've grown to like this flavor. The hops are very earthy, slight pine. The bitterness lingers, aided by the next category. Quite complex, fun to try to figure out.  M - This, in my opinion, is where the beer really shines. Definitely on the full side of medium-bodied and the carbonation makes it even more so.  O - I wonder what I would have thought of this beer had I never heard of it? It's not my favorite hop profile, but it is clearly very enjoyable, and I could certainly drink several in a sitting. It separates itself enough from other IPAs that I will clearly be making this a regular winter-time purchase. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jngrizzaffi,4.27,"Pours dark amber/red color with a 2 finger width foamy head. Head retention and lacing are decent. Has a nice piney aroma. Hints of citrus. Nice smooth piney hop with good transition from the preceding sweet, caramel, malty taste. Very fresh taste. Bitter, fruity taste at the end with a good bitter, soapy aftertaste. Seems a little different from last year's version, but I like it even better. Tastes like it may have just come out of the brewery.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,guityler83,3.76,"A: In a tulip glass the beer built a head the hight of a finger and a half made of fine tiny bubbles just a few shades darker then white. Good retention and as it fell it left a thick coat of lacing all down the side of the glass and small piles on the top of the liquid. The beer is a dark amber to light crimson color with a strong amount of haze.  S: The nose is ripe with grapefruit, citrus and pine with a reisienous undertone. A faint whiff of toasty malt aroma but most is coming from the hops in this beer.  T: A crisp firm bitterness with the grapefruit flavor dominating the palet. Its more of a round hop flavor then the typical SPA and more prominant. The middle of the flavor shows some of the pine that was detected in the nose along with some bready, toast and bread crust malt flavors. The finish is strong in the hops department also, clean and refreshing grapefruit.  M: Moderate amount of body and carbonation. lots of hop oils are left on the pallet making the bitterness linger and giving the impression of a bigger beer but its still very drinkable.  O: A solid hop profile with some maltyness to keep it interesting and the signiture grapefruit/pine flavor that SN does like know other.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Tank880,4.51,"This beer provides a very nice head. At times, depending on the glass, the head is a bit too thick. But the smell, the smell is superb. It is by far my favorite. The taste has a fine hop bite without being overpowered with the bitterness or the alcohol - but you know it is there. A favorite seasonal beer of mine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,utopiajane,4.08,"This is a nice little beer. it's got a fat head that shows excellent retention and sports plenty of lace. Toasty grain and a soft caramel malt lays down sweetly for an earthy but pungent grapefruit with a bit of pine and a sweet herbal. Brassy in color , the hops sparkle a little in this with a hint of candied orange peel and then it becomes husky with a touch of bread and grain and a pleasant bit of lemon rind to finish it off strong and dry. Anytime! This beer would be fine with me year round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,brurevu,4.28,"It poured a deep amber color with a good sized head and loads of floral hop aroma. The taste is big hops with a slight malty backbone, but mainly the big piney hops. While it leaves a lingering bitter pine finish I found the Celebration Ale nicely balanced and very drinkable. Such a great fresh hop IPA and always a welcome return to the season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BethanyB,4.03,"Appearance: Clear. A medium amber color, with a cream-colored head that is tightly beaded on the bottom and frothy on the top. The head is less impressive in comparison to other Sierra Nevada ales, but is still substantial and long-lasting in the long run.  Smell: Pale malt lets a round combination of earthy, floral, and citrus hops stand out along with lemon zest, rosemary, grapefruit, and honeysuckle. It's a familiar bouquet, as it's quite similar to that of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. The difference is that this combo is less bright and pungent.  Taste: Toasted malt, with just a thin slice of chocolate. Earthy, grassy, and citrus hop flavors create a round, yet complex profile--always impressive. The medium-high bitterness is interesting. I found this beer to be more bitter than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, as well as any of the IPAs the brewery has produced. I believe this is because the other flavors are less sweet and bright, and therefore do not create as much balance. A tiny bit of cinnamon also makes its way through as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full body and medium-high carbonation. While the bitterness lasts through the finish, it is not overpowering.  Overall: Less complex than I was hoping for. Still, a very good beer with some engaging qualities, and one that I would recommend. Subjectively speaking, this was a bit too dark and bitter for me--I like my bittering hops to be balanced by brighter hop flavors and some melanoidins. And yet, taking all beers and not just Sierra Nevada into consideration, this is an excellent ""specimen."" Ah, Sierra Nevada. It's too bad you have to compete against yourself.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,KYGunner,3.74,"This IPA poured a radiant copper with an inch of thick foam. The off white froth laced tremendously with a deep layering as the pint move slowly downward.  The scent is very citrusy with lots of lemon rind, touches of grapefruit and then a floral earthiness. I think the earthy scent may be some of the more vegetative rind but it is followed by a malty tea leaf.  I get a lot of pine on the palate and then a caramel malt sweetness. The flavors move to a lemony citrus but then end abruptly to a metallic tinnieness. I wish the flavors would hold on a little longer before resorting to the piney, tinny, metallic hop flavor that plagues so many IPA's. That flavor lends to feel with a dry astringency that leaves a long after taste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Roguer,4.1,"Two-finger cream head from a good pour; excellent retention and fantastic lacing. Brew is heavily caramel-colored, with a bit of orange or red highlight. Solid stream of carbonation.  Sweet malts and bright, mostly unspecified hops rise to the nose. Caramel and banana are balanced against floral hops with a hint of citrus and very muted pine.  Flavor mostly follows the nose, as well as incorporating a very SN-like profile (think Torpedo). Caramel is much more muted than you might fear from the appearance; juicy, green hops are definitely the forefront, but they're not overpowering. Fresh pine with a pleasing sweetness.  Mild carbonation sting; dry body with a pleasantly thin and wet aftertaste and coating; fairly light on feel. Pine sap and resin aftertaste that is neither unpleasant nor outstanding.  I don't quite get the hype. Celebration is certainly an excellent and drinkable IPA. That said, I don't really find it to be any tastier than Hoptimum or even Torpedo - the latter of which is available year-round. If you see it on the shelves, absolutely go buy it and try it, and enjoy drinking it all season long - I just didn't have my mind blown.  ***2017 Re-visit***  Celebration pours with one of the frothiest, best heads in the business; three fingers is easily achievable, and even in a 16 ounce glass, this beer consistently requires two pours.  Flavor features quite a bit of caramel grains, but without significant accompanying brown sugar sweetness. Some dry spiciness from the yeast. Hops present pine, citrus peel, a touch of citrus pulp, and plenty of bitterness.  Despite the many years - and accordingly, the massive expansion in IPA styles and hop varietals - that have passed since Celebration's introduction, it still stands as a very tasty and nearly unique IPA. It ages far better than most IPAs, staying full of flavor and avoiding staleness well past one and even two months.  However, I've also noticed something else: this beer has to be enjoyed on a fresh palate, or it becomes overwhelmingly grainy and bitter (to my palate, at least).  I enjoy this beer every year, and have really grown to respect it. I may still clock in with a -rDev, and I don't buy a case of it each season, but I certainly enjoy a six pack and the occasional draught.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste - Rich malt with fresh floral hops on top. Not super bitter but it has that wet hop pine.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with low carbonation. Slightly malt warm. Good drinkability.  Overall - Another solid Sierra Nevada brew! While it didn't blow me away, it IS exceptionally fresh and gives a fresh wet pine that I have not tasted anywhere else that I can remember.

T - Phenomenal. Very smooth with this much hops in it. The hops are not a blast like a DIPA or even some IPAs, but they are present. Not as much bitter bite to them, more of a nice level balanced flavor. Again, some spices, reminds me of Christmas. Almost a Marzen/IPA hybrid, very good!  M - Medium bodied, extremely drinkable.

The aroma has lots of caramel malt, bready sweetness, tons of sweet grapefruit juicy, pine, lots of hoppiness.  The flavor follows with tons of bitterness from pine that just attacks the palate with some woodiness, earthiness. Three quarters of the way in, there's this punch of sweet caramel that pops that really picks up the beer. The finish then moves onto a grapefruit peel and sweet pine as the caramel malt drives the fruit flavors up. Extremely dry on the finish.  The mouthfeel is very clean and on the lighter end of the medium.

Wow a very nice, big hop bam without the awful bitterness where som many brewers fail with big hops, Sierra Nevada does a great job on this brew.  M: Medium to medium light crisp bubbly feel, brews like these are changing my mind on big hops in the winter. I used to abandon most big hoppy brew when fall and winter started coming down, but this is very nice.. better than the recently reviewed accumulation ale, which is very good too in its use of hops..

Smell is lemon citrus with some orange and grapefruit backing it up. Certainly seems like it'll be more citrus hop forward than other brew I've had from SN.  taste definitely confirms my suspicion and is hop forward all the way. I get the lemon and grapefruit and a bit bitterness but not like torpedo. Halfway thru the pint, the hops step back as my palate adjusts and the caramel like maltiness akin to SN makes itself known  Well carbonated and carries a sticky syrup feel all the way thru. Refreshing but not very dry. Right time of the year for this IPA.  Pleased with this offering from SN. Online there other beers but not my favorites because their caramel maltiness isn't always what I'm looking for in an IPA but this one has the hip profile I'm looking for and is balanced nicely.

It's not wickedly bitter, doesn't finish like dish soap, actually smells pretty good, but there's just nothing else here but hops. If you are a ""hop-head"" who spends the rest of the year drinking bitter IPAs then you may find this a great ""holiday"" version of that. It has a great hop profile, and I think I'd enjoy it more as a summer beer.

I understand why this is so highly regarded now. It is the most balanced beer I have ever come across.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MaltyHoppyGood,3.06,"A : looks great! So excited to see the latest, freshest batch out. The 2010, 2011,and especially the 2012 batch were amazing. Huge, fluffy head, proper carbonation, deep amber/ copper color.  S: Mostly California/American ale yeast with some subtle hop aroma . Little, if no malt detected. Overwhelmingly yeasty while expecting so much fresh hop smell. Smells like Sierra Nevada.  T: some mild citrus hops, followed by medium sweet malts and a present back if tongue bitterness. There is a lot of balance here. Hops are hiding behind clean California yeast aroma. Drinks like a slightly bigger Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. This batch is particularly homogenous, having down played hops with an increase in balance. Can't taste fresh hops due to yeast/co2 aroma.  M: great drinking ale. Co2 is spot on, final gravity is perfect to balance sweet, bitter and alcohol. I enjoyed 12 oz quicker than expected. It is smooth, balanced and undistinguished.  O: 2013 aims to be an underwhelming, balanced IPA, a stark contrast to years previous. This beer lacked hop aroma, hop taste, notable character, and had an overly yeasty smell- It smells faintly like a macro. I had claimed this in years past as an amazing, highly recommended beer, but was disappointed this year. Perhaps SN is spreading their operation too thin? I loved their beer camp series, but it perhaps detracted from overall quality control on their most infamous craft beer. Better luck next year , old friend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MoorBeerPlz,4.25,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a globe glass...  On the pour, a hazy dark amber/copper color, nice carbonation and about 1 1/2 finger, off-white foamy head. Head backed off to thick lacing, a foam cap and nice sticky foam on the sides of the glass.  On the nose, piney hops, bready and maybe come citrus. Not quite the aromatics I was expecting.  Tasting was delightful. Hops, hops, and then a little citrus, some pine and the malt backbone. Nicely balanced from start to finish.  Nice medium body, right amount of carbonation and sooo smooth. Nice dry finish with the hoppy, piney aftertaste.  Great holiday brew and Sierra Nevada never disappoints me. Makes me wish I still lived near Chico. I highly recommend trying this.  Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ISmith87,3.77,"Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale - a – 4.00 – Great looking IPA. Nice thick film of white bubbles that leaves a nice lacing on the glass on top of a crystal clear amber-orange almost red beer. S – 3.75 – Fresh citrusy hop smell. Some pine, some floral notes. Little bit of spice maybe? There's definitely something extra there that I'm not getting. T – 3.75 – Citrusy hop smell. Grapefruit, orange, floral notes. Pine. Again I think there's some extra spices in here but I can't tell what. It's nicely balanced. M – 3.75 - this is definitely a medium bodied IPA, being a little bigger bodied than the rest. Alc is completely covered. Aftertaste is a piney, florally hop flavor, with some bitterness. O – 3.75 – It's not the best IPA I've had, nor the best winter ale. But it's good. More on the floral side of IPAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

M: Nice carbonation with a bit of bitter twang on the tongue. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy for the style, and the body is full.

140,1904,Stevedore,4.08,"12oz bottle from the 2013 vintage, bottled September 19 (262nd day) of this year, poured into a plastic cup and consumed in the hotel room in Iowa City today, 10/7/2013. I've had last year's vintage but never properly reviewed it.. previously gave it a 4.25 back on 1/2/2013.  Review #284.  Pours a dark amber body, clear looking with a fantastic, substantial offwhite head that's probably about 2cm with really, really good retention and lacing. Really, the head reminds me of the top of a latte, haha. This is a beautiful beer that is archetypical of the Sierra Nevada pale ale family.  Smells fairly tame. Chico yeast spice with a fair bit of bready maltiness. Can't really get the hops here outside of a bit of pineyness (if thats a word..)  Now this tastes great. Nice malty backbone, bready and biscuity, accompanied by a nice resinous hop flavour remniscent of grassiness, earthiness and pine. No citrus here. Its actually quite sweet and bitter all in one; with the bitterness mounting on the back-end. Its hoppy as heck.  Solid mouthfeel; medium bodied, well-carbonated, smooth and creamy. A bit too bitter for me, but that doesn't take away from the beer. Its refreshing, not quite poundable but quite drinkable.  Very nice fresh hop ale. IMO the hoppiness in this beer is what fresh hop ales should be. I'm looking at you, Founders and Three Floyds. Very balanced despite the massive hop bitterness on the back end; jam-packed full of malt and hop flavours and bitterness. It might be a bit too bitter for its own good, but hey- at the price it sells for, why wouldn't you have some every winter?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SteveB24,4.81,"picked this up while shopping at trader joe's. was really really impressed.  appearance; beautiful ,clear, reddish brown, sticky head that settles into nice lacing, evident bubbles.  smell; complex, delicious hop smell. undertones of grass, pine and grapefruit.  taste; strong hops, but the taste is a complex harmony of bitterness, smoothness and full body.  mouthfeel. refreshing with a dry finish. carbonation is a tad strong.  overall; bought two bottles. will go back for a six pack. very impressed, definitely warming and great for the cold but would love it all year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DeFaz,4.39,"Appearance: Wow, there's some great lacing here, and the head retention is excellent.  Smell: Grass, fruit, caramel--hops and malt for sure in the smell. I'm not smelling the spices that I expected to pick up on  Taste: There's the typical IPA flavors of pine and grapefruit, but there are other fruit flavors here as well. Along for the ride is distinct roasted malts that make this a not-so-traditional IPA. There's a lot going on, and I can't put my finger on all of it, but I like it.  Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel, carbonation on the lower side but it has some crispness.  Overall: This is one of the best winter beers I have found, and at $8.99/six pack it's quite reasonably priced. There's a lot of flavor and enough to talk about to please just about any beer drinker.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Khad,4.46,"What we have here is something pretty special. Celebration Ale is a unique IPA with hops, hops and more hops. I poured this from a bottle into a pint glass. Wonderful appearance with a head that sticks around and provides excellent lacing. To the nose you get plenty of hops, there is no mistaking you are about to consume one of the great American IPAs. While the hops overpowers the scent the taste is loaded with yes....of course hops but you'll also pick up a lot of pine, small amounts of citrus and yes more hops. This IPA works great for the holidays as this might be a bit much for the warmer part of the year.  To sum it up, this is a very very complex beer with layers of flavor but not much balance...but it works here. Definitely not for the faint of heart but for the true enthusiast, Celebration Ale is a world class brew and a real treat!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Tilley4,4.6,"Oily sticky hops pound away at the palate... had this beer loads of times, somehow haven't reviewed it... my favorite Christmas release... yes, an IPA but once I see that snowy cabin on front, I know that the holiday season is here... very drinkable despite the relentless hop assault... pine resin in a glass...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,damndirtyape,4.39,"12oz bottle (date stamp 32821 05:56) poured into a Libby globe porter/stout glass.  Appearance: Slightly hazy deep amber. Light tan thin head. Lots of lacing all over the glass - strands, fine crazed lines, islands, etc. Nice looking beer.  Smell: Citrusy, some tropical fruit, underlying sweetness, just a hint of something coppery when first poured, but this went away.  Taste: Very hoppy. Pine, citrus, malt (roasted malt bitterness, caramel notes, lingering bready - like a sweet roll - mixed in with the bitter finish). Hops pop out right up front, then the malt sweetness, then a mixed sweet and bitter finish. VERY well balanced. Hop forward, but just right. Strongly hoppy on the burp which surprised me.  Mouthfeel: Just right carbonation. Definitely some hop oils sticking to the teeth afterwards. Pleasant thickness.  Overall / Drinkability: I can see why this is so highly rated, as I wish I had bought a six-pack rather than just a single. This would work nicely as a replacement for my Nosferatu that I'm running out of - wonderful hops, but with a solid malt backbone to compliment it all and make it pleasurable drinking experience. I could easily have another one in a sitting. I had this with pulled pork BBQ (mustard based sauce) and green beans and it went quite well with food. I wouldn't mind having a snifter of this either though for a cold winters night. The pine and citrus hops remind me of summer on a cold evening. Great beer!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tmm313,3.8,"Appearance: Slightly hazy copper color with a nice 2 finger head. Really good lacing  Smell: Sweet grapefruit with a just touch of tropical fruit and pine. Slight lemon. The smell in the background that I would usually call caramel reminds me more of maple syrup this time around.  Taste: The more you drink it, the more you appreciate it. As it sits on your tongue, it tastes like sweet grapefruit and orangey citrus. When you swallow, there is a quick transformation into bitter piney hops and a fantastic sweet malt backbone. As it warms, the malt becomes much more pronounced.  Mouthfeel: Crisp carbonation. Kind of thick, with an oily bitter finish. Lingers for a while.  Overall: This is pretty good. The first few times I drank it, I really didn't care for it very much. I guess that's one of the pros of having a six pack instead of a single; you have to give it 6 tries. I'm not saying I'm going to buy it by the case now, but I'll probably buy it every now and then over the holidays.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Plenty of lacing sticks to the glass.  Smell: Sierra nevada hoppiness, sweet, pine and citrus. Smells at lot like torpedo to me but not as strong. Not a strong aroma by any means.  Taste: Pine and citrus hops roll smoothly over the palate and then finishes with a bitter blast and a sweet finish. As the beer warms, more citrus comes out in the hops and the bitter bite is still balanced with the sweet malts on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, feels great.  Overall, this is a very well done IPA. Great citrus flavors come out with the hops and the malts really balance this beer with some sweetness. Only thing that wasn't awesome with this beer was the aroma.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HoppySailor,4.44,"(Much of this review was written in May 2012 and based on a 190 day old sample but i chose to keep that content because I saw value in it. parenthetical statements are current in Nov 2013)  Twelve-ounce bottle poured into a New Belgium snifter. The first thing I need to point out is that I LOVED this brew when I had it back in December 2011. This 12-pack was dated 10-26-2011 and I bought it on 16 MAY 2012. I knew from the outset that I was a couple of weeks on the outside of the freshness factor if the brew had been stored properly, and based on where I bought it, I was pretty sure it wasn't stored properly.  Appearance- nice amber color with nice head, heavy lacing and enough sediment to brick a house. (All still the same in 2013)  Smell- smells a little stale, or unhoppy. I am sure this is because of the age. It was still on a shelf though, so I have to call it like I see it... and the smell was not up to par for my IPA taste.(2013 version lacks strong citrus smell, but nice bready malt smell)  Taste- Even at 190+ days old, this one has a great west-coast IPA bitterness. Not really the citrus hops I remembered from a fresh version, but still slightly above the average IPA that seems to be flooding the market from every Tom, Dick and Harry who can get the funds up to start a brewery and buy some hop pellets. (This 2013 is two weeks old, and tastes like manna from heaven, as I expected it would. Like a soft version of Torpedo)  Mouthfeel- Still perfect. Well, close to perfect. Nice carbonation that dies quick on the tongue. Bottle conditioning makes the best mouthfeel out there. This is no exception. (Yep, in 2013 this is even more true)  Overall- I cant wait until October when the 2012 version of this is available. I hope I am not out to sea with the Navy all winter, because after I finish all 12 of these, I am going to notice a void in my fridge. I long for a fresh Celebration. Even a stale one is better than a fresh version of so many IPAs. (I was out to sea all winter 2012, but did get some Celebration and loved it. The 2013 is slightly less fruity or citrusy than 2011, but still as awesome. Worth the annual wait!)  UPDATE: I failed to review the 2012 version, but here I am a year later LOVING the 2013 offering as much as I did in 2011 as reviewed above. I have updated the numbers to reflect. OUTSTANDING.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Chiefy770,4.58,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. 2013 label the bottle.  Appearance: Transparent amber body with a very thick and fluffy off-white head on top. Incredible sticky lacing throughout.  Smell: Big aroma. Hops stand out. Herbal and citrus notes also are present.  Taste: The hops break through a great base of toasted malts. Notes of citrus really come through in the aftertaste. The alcohol creates a great warming sensation.  Overall: I am normally not a big fan of IPAs in the colder months but this beer is definitely worth breaking the parade of stouts and porters. This IPA contains more herbal-pine flavors than fruity citrus flavors, which makes this a great tasting brew in the winter. The malts are also incredibly tasty. This would be the perfect beer to grab after walking five miles in a foot of snow to cut down a Christmas tree, then dragging said tree back to your cabin.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Kuaff,4.16,"In a mug, maybe slightly below cellar temperature.  The Celebration begins with a two-finger off-white head over a clear dark amber color. One of the darkest IPAs I've seen.  There is some nice sweet citrus in the scent - lemon and grapefruit, I think. Also some sweet, biscuity breadiness and a pine smell which I would call the opposite of astringent; It's like, soft pine.  Bitterness is pretty low in the taste. There's a little bit of tangy citrus in the beginning, but then it's all the sweet bread and biscuits to the end, with maybe a bit of spicy hops in the finish. An overall malt-forward flavor for an IPA. Very satisfying.  The carbonation and fullness are sort of in the middle of extremes. There's nothing off-putting here.  While I don't think this is anything to write home about, it's nevertheless a very nice IPA, and one that has more to it than just hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,xVERITAS,4.38,"Poured out of a glass into a tulip. A dark copper with a red hue to it. Smells of super fresh hops and pine.  Tastes very unique, there were some notes I couldn't quite pick out. It is indeed, as the bottle says, pretty hoppy. I have heard people say it isn't drinkable, and they are insane. I could drink this all day. It is very smooth from the first sip to the last. The bitterness is perfect...more bite than a regular IPA but not quite as intense as a DIPA. A very solid beer all around, would highly recommend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,goldendenizen,4.15,"A: Dark, golden brown. Def. lacing and keeps a good head throughout the glass. (poured into a Drakes's 2012 pint glass)  S: Very good smell coming out of this one! Malt backbone for sure, with fresh hops supporting.  T: Really like what SNBC has done throughout the years. I feel this year is more malt forward but what the hell do I know?! Regardless, my palate tells my brain to buy this year after year. Ive never been disappointed. Great price point as well! As another user stated, you probably cant find a better beer for the value.  M: Pretty smooth for all the favor packed into this brew. I also dig the amount of carbonation.  O: I definite go to for any hop head who needs a holiday brew. Year after year, SNBC comes through!

S - Very fresh hop smell. I get some citrus fruits and I hate to say it but I'm getting some spiciness on the nose. Little bit of pine as well; pretty complex.  T - Wow, quite hoppy citrus flavor at the front which morphs into a sweet pine taste. Bitterness is present but not overwhelming, a very complex drinkable tasty IPA!  M - Thin to medium feel. Maybe a bit thinner than I prefer in an IPA but it contributes to the drinkability so it's not all bad. Carbonation seems just right though, coats your mouth decently.  O - Sierra Nevada knows their hops! This is the first year trying this acclaimed brew and I am glad to had nearly drank a case already. For the price point, this is some of the best bang for your buck besides Little Sumpin Sumpin and Sucks.

T- Pine, grains, hops, a hint of dirt and smoke. Citrus/grapefruit notes as it warms.  M- Carbonation is medium high. Heft is medium.  O - A decent IPA. I would imagine timing is everything with this offering, as I am not sure how this would hold up once the hops mellow, as there is not much malt to back it up. Pine lovers rejoice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,screamking,4.38,"12 oz bottle poured into snifter.  Pours dark amber with a two finger khaki head. Beautiful looking brew. The aroma is filled with all kinds of notes. Orange citrus, cinnamon, caramel, maple, brown sugar, and lemon just to name a few. The taste is also quite well crafted. It is incredibly balanced from the get go. Nice burst of citrus closely followed by a caramel bready malt. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. ABV is right where it should be and goes unnoticed. This one is a winner from the beginning. It's equally affordable as it is good. It's hard to find a better beer at this price point anywhere in the US.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,barczar,3.84,"Pours a hazy deep copper with a billowing, frothy beige head that lingers.  Caramel malt, dank, resiny hops, and citrus form the initial aroma. Grapefruit and pine emerge as it warms.  Resin and muted citrus are evident initially in the flavor, which finishes fairly bitter. Muted grapefruit underlies a lightly caramelized malt backbone, which is subtle, but ties into the resiny finish. Floral notes emerge in the aftertaste.  Body and carbonation are moderate, with a light astringency and alcohol warmth accompanying.  A little bitter and muddled for my palate. A very drinkable beer, though. Nothing outstanding.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,scotorum,4.09,"Bottled on day 281 of 2013, aka about October 7th.  Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a Sierra Nevada IPA glass.  a: Clear amber with an inch and a half offwhite head which receded to very heavy surface foam and more solid lacing all aroung than I can recall seeing from any beer pour.  s: Have a cold right now but passages not very blocked, still can't really detect much here.  t: Nice malt/hops balance, hops linger at the sides of the tongue with sharp but not extreme bitterness.  m: Moderate, good body, medium carbonation evident.  o: Very good rich yet drinkable brew. Would like to try this side by side with Flipside and Torpedo though, seems like I enjoyed those more. And with all the new DIPAs and Wet Hops out this one seems blandish by comparison. Some of us may be getting spoiled. Or maybe the aforementioned cold is making more of a difference than I allowed.  UPDATE 11/27/13: Had a second bottle from the same purchase and really enjoying what seems like a perfect balance between plenty of hops and a mild but substantial malt base. Probably the best of its type for the price out there. Still not much aroma, but the hops include a bit of the fresh hops vegetal aftertaste which sets good fresh hops apart.

140,1904,surfcaster,4.28,"First of the season and did not disappoint. Forgot it was a fresh hop.  Beautiful dark orange pour with light head. Not super pungent on the aroma but the taste was just spectacular. I had forgotten that subtle spice taste that evolves amongst the fresh hops that are as bright as ever. As balanced and integrated as could be imagined without compromising the desires of every hophead.  Cannot wait to decorate the tree with a Christmas flick on and fire in the background. SN has exceeded expectations with quality and value. Without a doubt, the best Christmas Seasonal.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ONovoMexicano,4.17,"2014 bottle poured into a can-shaped glass. A beer like this needs that wide-mouth.  I feel like a record on repeat, but I always start of Sierra Nevada reviews by commenting how marvelous the head is. Here it is fluffy, billowing, pale cream in color and three fingers thick. This looks even better over the dark amber body with a slight cloudiness. 4.5  I also usually comment on the big floral bouquet that SN beers have and there's that here, but piney hops are even more prominent and resinous. There's an oily and earthy hop aroma there that seems thicker than your average hops. Toasty malts lie beneath all of this. 4.25  It's tougher to nail down the hops on the tongue. They're not nearly as piney, though still resinous and earthy. Fruitier notes like pineapple become apparent with a few swishes around the tongue. There's even some faint orange juice. Biscuity, toasted malt notes provide a bit of variation about mid-palate. 4  Celebration is such an easy-sipping beer despite the fact it's got a stiff bitterness towards the finish. It's medium-bodied, low-carbonation and creamy before the semi-dry, bitter finish. 4.25  This beer drinks as easy as any session IPA but packs so much more flavor and body. It's a splendid beer. 4.25",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Light / medium body with a balance of hop flavor and bitterness tilted to the bitter side. Hop flavor is of pine and grapefruit - quite nice. Less bitter than Torpedo, but more than Flipside. Hop flavor is less than Flipside. Finishes with a slight hop flavor and lingering bitterness. If hop flavor is your preference, go with Flipside. If bitterness is your bag, go with Torpedo. This one falls in between the two. These 3 SN brews can give you a good contrast of IPAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Tones-,4.78,"Saw this on the shelves at my local grocery store - knew it was coming - but I'm always so happy to see it each year!  Appearance: Nice amber with a solid 2-3 finger head that goes down to about 1 finger after a bit, but stays for the entirety of drinking. Strong lacing. A few streams of carbonation bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass throughout drinking. Irrelevant, but will mention: the bottle design is nice enough...evokes feelings of being warm and cozy during the holidays.  Smell: FRESH hops (not resiny or dank) steal the show, with grapefruit citrus and biscuity malt co-starring, and seemingly slightly more than years past (based on my memory of it).  Taste: Delicious. If you let it get a bit warm and take a big gulp, on exhaling you will get a hit of alcohol. Best not to let this one warm up too much - but in the cold weather, and considering how good it tastes, that shouldn't be an issue...  Mouthfeel: Feels smoother than I remember it, ie. slightly less carbonated sharpness on swallowing. It's still plenty carbonated and finishes crisp though. Also less resin-y aftertaste lining my mouth than I remember in previous years...these are improvements that take this beer to borderline 100/100 status IMO.  Overall: Basically the best beer you can get AT THIS PRICE POINT*. Big asterisk. But for $8.50/sixer, and $17/12er, look at your other options and there is no contest. Fresh hop ale, indeed...it tastes so damn fresh, it's unreal. Never had an IPA that tasted this fresh, though my batch was probably bottled ~1 week ago.

This must be the afterlife. As echoed by many others here, this one isn't very balanced, but great nonetheless. The hops cut through everything else, but a spicy maltiness is present as well as some grapefruit citrus. Adult candy.  Mouthfeel: Medium-heavy body with a smoothness that's top-notch.  Overall: Wow... I've seen this beer hyped in the forum so I had to try it. No disappointment here. It might be in my top three favorites now. I'll have to see how I feel after the next five of them.

140,1904,joe1510,4.25,"12oz. Bottle $14.99 12-Pack Binny's Willowbrook  2006 Bottling  Celebration Ale is a clear copper concotion with a moderate amount of carbonation bubbles rising throughout. There's a creamy white 1+ finger head atop the body that fades to a half finger cap. Leaves spotty lacing with each drink that slowly falls back to the body.  There's very lightly toasted grains way in the background along with a caramel sweetness. What comes to the front is a strong hop presence. Big pine and earthy qualities. There is a small splash of grapefruit juice on top of it all. This is one that makes my mouth water.  The caramel sweetness sets the stage for the big hop flavors. Caramel upfront quickly just so you know it's there is taken over by the big hop flavors that were in the nose. Pine leads the way at first. Mid-palate through the finish turns to unsweetened grapefruit. there's a very solid hop bitterness that lingers till the next drink. This bitterness is more reminiscent of pine again. Very nicely done.  Mouthfeel is really nice. Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Coats the tongue slightly but goes down easily. Carbonation is just enough to keep things pushing through.  This is an easy one to put back. I It gives you a tongue beating but not enough to ruin future tastings. The body makes this extremely easy to handle.  This is a top notch IPA. Something to look forward to every winter. I like the assertive hoppiness. Celebration Ale is my kind of IPA. It's close to the top of my list, very close.

140,1904,RooferOnFire,4.47,"I've been desperately seeking this brew after reading so many positive Beer Advocate and Untappd reviews. I had this wish listed for months, pretty sure I was only acquiring it via an expensive trade, when I went into the BCLC and a worker was bringing out the singular six-pack, ordered for a customer who never claimed it, to offer it for sale. I had to have it. She warned me of the high price point ($15), but I put back my usual Unibroue and triumphantly brought my treasure to the checkout.  I've been intrigued by SN because I am a big believer in IPAs, and they're pretty much the introducer of the American IPA. The bottle features festive motifs of pointsettias and snow, with some hops displayed to tell you what's inside. A lot of people have complained that this isn't a Winter warmer, but I do not read anything that claims it to be. What is promised is a Fresh Hop Ale, and I hope this lives up to the hype.  (12oz bottle poured into chilled slender mug; purchased March 26, 2013; serve temp 50-55f)  A (What's Inside): We've got head. Lasting, foamy head with carbonation that looks like it could last for days. Almost looks like a float when viewed from overhead. Nice middle-dark amber-to-red body- think English toffee. Excellent lacing throughout. Remains beautiful until the last sips. (Caveat: you need to know how to pour beer well to enjoy this in a mug. If you cannot, stick to the well-designed bottle.  Smell: Hello hops, pleased to enjoy your presence. Pine, syrup, blood orange. Not heavy enough to intimidate the unindoctrinated but stinky enough to invite you inside.  Taste: Citrus right from the beginning. Bitter orange peel and lemon. Spruce and juniper. Very bitter with a slightly sweet backbone. Powerful without completely crushing your palate. Solid.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly easy-drinking for the genre, especially from a bottle. Well-carbonated in the glass, but not a destruction in your mouth. Leaves a 20-second coniferous hop aftertaste that can linger and may scare some newbies away from a second pint.  So, is it worth it? Absolutely. While some Canadian DIPAs do exceed this, it's not a CDIPA. I'm writing this while reaching for my second. Certainly a great treat after yesterday's Shaftebury disaster.  This is a Christmas beer- with syrup, mistletoe, and the whole damn spruce tree. It's also a great IPA, and the hops do get mightly fresh with you. There is enough sweet malt to keep the forest in your mouth from igniting, and this is mightily addictive, so you can session it if you have a decent alcohol tolerance and a designated driver. It's more potent than the average IPA, both in taste and alcohol content, so beware.  I tried this 2 ways- bottle and mug, and found that the mug accentuated the aroma, flavour, and feel of this brew, so I'd say this rates a 4 from a bottle and 4.5 from a mug. Rookies may want to stick with the bottle, hop heads should reach for a big ol' glass.  In summation, this is a special American. It rivals other IPA styles while staying true to its California roots. Sierra Nevada has impressed me and I'll be ordering the 2013 version come October, hoping it lives up to this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Aroma: Lots of hop aroma at the front. Citrus notes: grapefruit, orange peel. Slight pine/earthiness. A bit of a sweet, bready character on the finish.  Taste: Big bitter note upfront. Fades nicely into some citrus character. Lots of grapefruit and orange, following up with some pine flavor. Finishes malty, a nice breadiness and carbonation cleanses the palate.  Mouthfeel: Medium body on this one, sticks to the mouth a bit before finishing very dry. Carbonation scrubs the palate well, getting you ready for the next drink.  Overall: A very well crafted, classic brew from Sierra Nevada. Hits the spot during the winter season as a change of pace from the typical winter warmers.

A - Pours a nice two and a half fingers of fluffly doughy off-white head, with excellent retention. Very nice caramel candied orange colored body. Plenty of bubbles rushing to the top. Nice big sheets of lacing.  S - Underneath all that persisting head, the only aromas I manage to pick up are that of a toasted caramelized malt sweetness, with a bit of underlying grapefruit / pine needle hops. I almost sense a bit of vanilla sweetness, or alcohol astringency.  T - From the first sip onward, I was extremely impressed with what this beer had to offer. Sweet apple fruitiness, some bitter grapefruit hops, sweet caramelized malts. Smooth and creamy, and extremely well-balanced. Perfect level of hop bitterness paired with the malt profile.  M - Sticky green apple sweetness lingering around. Some grapefruit bitterness stick around also. Otherwise the beer is smooth and creamy, and highly drinkable by all means.  Overall, I'm glad I decided to stop sleeping on this beer and pick up a bottle. Highly balanced and tasty, and with a nice warming 6.80% abv, I think I might even like this beer better than Lagunitas Sucks, just because of how well balanced the Sierra Nevada Celebration is.

Perfume-like spice characteristic also hangs in the background. A touch of marsh mellow sweetness. As it warms the malt sweetness tends to come forward.  M - Sticky and dry  O - A solid IPA, the hopping is perhaps a bit too focused on the bittering aspect and less on the flavor/aroma, however this bottle is over a month old so it may be a bad representation of the wet-hopping.

Freshness is key, as the hop oils from the 3 C's really take hold with a nice piney bitterness.

140,1904,rickyleepotts,3.32,"It's not Christmas time, but we are drinking a bottle of Celebration Ale. We actually tried this in a beer class at Total Wine & More, and I wasn't impressed. It tasted like an IPA. I had a conversation the other night on Google+ about this beer aging well. Normally an IPA won't age… especially with such a low ABV. He said it gets better… maybe next year I will grab a few bottles and throw them in the cellar. I still have a hard time believing it will age well, but we'll see! Maybe the Scottsdale Total Wine has a few bottles left. I will check the next time I am in.  Good thing I like hoppy beers, because all I remember about this are the hops. Time to drink!  In the Glass: When we did this beer in the beer class, there were several other beers we were tasting. 13 beers total. Perhaps that wrecked my palate a little bit. I will say, I do not remember it looking this thick and creamy in the glass. It produces a very nice, thick creamy head that I want to eat with a spoon! There is also a lovely lace that hangs on to the side of the glass as I swirl it around a little. Looks like a lot of bubbles are rushing to the surface, and it leaves a nice copper color.  Nose: Smells like hops! I remember talking about this beer being nothing special. It's not. At least when I smell it. I wouldn't be able to consider this a winter beer just based on the aroma. It smells like hops. Maybe the flavor profile has changed since I last had this.  Flavor: Nope. Tastes like an IPA. The hops they use are good, but this beer is nothing to write home about. Imagine licking a pine cone… that is the hop profile I am getting from this. Not a bad beer by any means, but not worthy of the ""winter warmer"" classification. They should brew this all year and change the name/label.  Mouthfeel: The beer has a little bit of carbonation up front, then it mellows out as you swallow. There is a nice biting dryness toward the finish that lingers on the back of the palate. This would be a beer I could easily drink 6 of and not even realize I was drinking beer. (The burp is nice, too. Those same earthy hop flavors come rushing back to the surface.)  Aftertaste: I like hoppy beers, and generally because of the aftertaste. The aftertaste here is somewhat dry, and then the hoppy flavors hang on. It's not overwhelming, but the aftertaste is a typical expectation from an average IPA.  Like I said, this should NOT be a seasonal release. Sierra Nevada is better than that. But for a guy that likes hops, it is a good beer. By the way, the label calls this a fresh hop IPA… and I generally don't like fresh hopped beers. I would like to see them do another version of this and either double the ABV (consider it an imperial IPA) or barrel age it. They just released the barrel aged Bigfoot, so they have some barrels sitting around!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

M - Medium creamy body with medium carbonation.  O - Overall, this wasn't that great. Probably one of Sierra Nevada's lesser beers. Don't get me wrong, It would be wonderful as a session IPA or an IPA to introduce somebody to craft beers, but to a veteran reviewer it doesn't offer a whole lot since the flavor profile never fully comes through or develops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Really an ideal winter brew but a good thirst quencher. I've been drinking this for years but somehow never reviewed it before.

Taste is orange peel, spicy coriander, burnt sugar. Very floral, especially as it sits. Pretty bitter, but with the sweetness to back it up.  The head feels frothy, but is creamy in the mouth.

There is a light malt aroma under there having a bit of clean malt sweetness and some caramel and biscuty notes. The yeast is a fairly clean American ale style.  T: Aggressive hops bitterness and strong hops flavor take center stage on this one and just enough malt for support. The hops flavors are again citrus with some pine.

There is some malty sweetness, but it's hard to pick up on any other characteristics.  M: A feel that manages to be creamy but thin with a proper amount of carbonation.  O: It's hard to get over those blunt hops in the taste, but otherwise, this is a very solid IPA with some welcomed sweetness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste/feel: Truly outstanding, and that's all that can really be said about it ... one of the best beers that I have ever had, no doubt.

It generally has that Sierra Nevada taste which all of their APA/IPA's like Pale Ale, Torpedo, and Ruthless Rye have, but I think this is the most aromatic of the bunch and it kind of has that piney zest that makes me think of Christmas. In comparison, Ruthless is a bit dryer, Torpedo the most bitter, and the Pale the lightest and easy-drinkingest.

M - Medium bodied and carbonated. Drying finish. Works well with the flavor profile.  O - A really good and balanced IPA. I found the hop profile to have a little too much pine for my personal taste.

140,1904,Jadjunk,4.13,"This is a re-review of a holiday classic that I have savored annually for several years now. ""Celebration Ale is a special ale for the holidays. Featuring the first hops of the growing season, this pioneering IPA is full of complex flavors and aromas from the generous use of whole cone American hops."" Celebration Ale is brewed in the style of a Fresh-hopped American IPA.  Poured from a 12oz. bottle to a snifter. Served in the upper 40ºs Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours an initially thick but crispy cream froth head that retains slightly above average, slowing as it settles. Lacing is thin and spotty. Body color is a brilliant golden orange with some sediment-like matter in suspension, giving the clarity significant haze. 4  (Smell) Robust, full and fresh resiny and piney hops character are first and foremost, followed with fainter citrus notes, rounded out with a slick caramel body. The wet hop aroma provides a full hop aroma without burdening the balance and overpowering the bitterness perceived in the aroma. Overall, it's an approachable beer with a lot of hop character and a mellow, but balanced warm malt backbone. It's not super complex, but pleasing and inviting. Aroma overall is quite muted at low temperatures, so I regret popping the cap prematurely on this. Best let it warm until the low to mid 50ºs for the full hopped nose experience. 3.5  (Taste) Big wet hop flavor, medium hop bitterness. Wet hopped IPAs are something of a specialty and don't come often outside of harvest ales but they work wonders in providing full hop flavor and character in this beer and enhancing the body depth significantly. Hop character is not as bright and sharp as in most IPAs but is well-rounded and pairs well with the sweet (and deep) caramel background. There's likely a touch of rye and honey malt with the caramel for depth. There's some substantial bitterness to be found here, especially on the finish, but with a thorough malt bill it really balances out. Overall, it makes for a much heavier-bodied IPA than the rest of the IPA crowd, chock full of flavor and character too. Growing alcohol and resiny bitterness give this beer a bit of a spicy bite on the finish. As an IPA, it's a really different take on the style but works out phenomenally with a really approachable, enjoyable flavor. 4.5  (Mouthfeel) A pleasing medium ground with some chewy body and a resiny slickness that strays from focusing on excessive carbonation. Body is heavy for the style, short of medium amongst all beers. Alcohol presence is medium and up. It really defines a style outside of an IPA but the carbonation level and body are nearly ideal for the flavor of this beer. 4.5  (Overall) Sierra Nevada Celebration is a classic. Coming out during a time when most people are contempt on Imperial Stouts and Belgian Quadrupels, Celebration offers a remarkable spin on the IPA, providing a beer with some hop character, a slick, chewy caramel background and an unbelievably deep body for a beer commonly associated with crisp malts and citrusy hops. Getting this beer as close to fresh as possible is the best way to savor the fragile flavors this holiday classic has to offer. 4  Vertical Reviews:  2011 (1+ Year Aged): Despite having a more presentable head quality, surprisingly for an aged IPA, the sediment in suspension has settled and cleared significantly, resulting in slightly improved clarity and perhaps an ever-slightly (but hardly perceivable) brighter coloration in the body. Aroma suggests the obvious; the hop character has almost completely faded, but the caramel body intensifies with age, smelling even more powerful and warm and and the yeast matches, developing sweet fruity characteristics to the mix, reminiscent of raisins and dates. The flavor is similar, albeit falls shallow in a couple of key areas, most notably the sweetness, which has diminished significantly, resulting in a dryer malt profile. Hop flavor lends a hand to balance out the beer although it isn't nearly as bright as it once was, Hop bitterness has held up well, although it is growing sharply out of balance amongst the diminishing malt profile. The bitter, thick finish isn't nearly as intense as it was in the fresh batch, either. Many of the yeast characteristics developing in the nose carry over to the flavor, although still partially masked by the hop bitterness. Although there were a few things going for this beer in the beginning, the overall impression is that much of the strength this beer has is in its freshness and bright spirit. An aged bottle isn't terrible, but it loses much of its balance and flavor, and in that regard, loses even more of its overall appeal. Consider holding aside a bottle to see if it works for yourself, but the results may not be desirable for everybody.  Recommended Age: As fresh as possible.

Right behind is a bit of bready yeast and a whiff of floral as well  T- Amazingly well balanced. It tastes exactly like it smells, just more intense. Pine and resin mixed with the crispness of the grapefruit. There is also toasty & sweet malts to round it out. Everything works in harmony.  M- Light to medium mouthfeel, but not at all watery. Nicely carbonated as well. Very refreshing and crisp. There was a long, hoppy, bitter (but not unpleasantly so) finish.  O- Full disclosure. I usually don't like IPAs. But this beer was a revelation.

My best description would be clean and hoppy, but not overwhelming.  T: The bittering hops are definitely up front in this beer but, as was the case with aroma, the hops are strong but not excessive. There is a nice bitter aftertaste.  M: Fairly light without being watery. Crisp with a hoppy bite.  O: This strikes me as a very solid IPA.

Not sure if that was supposed to be there or not and it wasn't chill haze as I poured this at cellar temp and the yeasties stuck around.  S: Hops. Just hops.  T: The first time I had this beer, all I got was hops. This time, I found some malt in the background.

There is enough malt to keep it from being undrinkable but it's not as balanced as other IPA's out there.

The taste was strong grapefruit. Quite intense grapefruit- perhaps a bit too intense for the beer. This taste would be more approachable in a DIPA.  Overall: a fine American IPA. Very drinkable.

The pleasant aromas of fresh, dank, piny hops coupled with caramely, bready malt fill the nose. Huge, fresh, piny hops (some pungent grapefruit in there as well) prevail through the healthy dose of malt. Notes of rye bread crust and caramel (a little burnt) try to balance out the pine, but can't stand up to it. Pine lingers & lingers on the palate while finishing dry and bitter. Medium body, smooth but resiny reminiscent of pine tar. Overall, although it's fairly one-note with not a whole lot of complexity, I love this seasonal IPA.

A touch of grapefruit bitterness on the finish. Hard time finding the malt under the hops, but there was definite sweetness present.

140,1904,fatmusic14,4.1,"Not typically a huge fan of Sierra Nevada brews, but love fresh hop so I figured I'd give this a shot.  Pours darker than you'd think, a terrific mix of orange, red - shaded down 1 octave. Good head, hangs around. Decent lacing, but the remaining head is really the pointman here.  Smells like a pinecone. Straight up. Very earthy - overpowering pine and slight hints of soil. Subtleness of the scent combination really takes your mind to a different place.  Tastes like it smells, like a terrific ale. Plenty of hops, pine, citrus, not overpoweringly bitter, but strong.  M - fresh, delicious. Carbonation at good levels, IPA aftertaste.  O - great beer. If you're an elitist, its worth straying from the craft for this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,NICKV1117,4.3,"One of my favorite seasonal offerings from Sierra Nevada (or any other brew maker for that matter).  Pours a beautiful amber, clear with a decent amount of carbonation. Put a nose on it and you smell that deep pine and citrus that we have come to know from West Coast I P A. Sweet, but not too floral. The taste is similar to their fantastic Torpedo, yet with a bit more spice.  All in all, it truly compliments the joys of the season. A winner.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,phishsihq,4.17,"This American IPA pours a clear amber color, and it is capped by a thin head of off-white foam that dissipates quickly and provides decent lace. Big citrus and pine aromas and a decent caramel malt nose. Caramel and bready malt sweetness give way to citrusy hop flavors and bitterness. Amazingly smooth and incredibly well-balanced, Celebration ale is medium in both body and carbonation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tastymug,3.44,"Appearance: Really nice clear, red copper color. Poured with a great head and leaves lots of nice lacing on the glass.  Smell: Mix of malts and hops in the nose with some citrus and pine.  Taste: Well-balanced taste. Definitely more hoppy than anticipated for a winter-time beer but it’s not overpowering—it should appeal to hop heads and those that like a more malty taste.  Mouthfeel: Crisp with a nice amount of carbonation; light to medium bodied.  Overall: For what this beer advertises, it certainly delivers. While I prefer a more spiced type of wintertime ale, this one delivers for its genre. Very drinkable, good level of alcohol ... beautiful color and head. I could definitely drink more than one of these to counteract the sweets at the Christmas family meal!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Hopheadjeffery,4,"Tasted in a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Look is bright amber, two finger head and lingering lacing. Smell is citrus fruit and hints of cocoa.

140,1904,totallyrelaxed,5,First review of Celebration-  A- What a beautiful beer. A nice redish copper color which really fits the season. Beautiful off-white head about a finger thick.  S- Tons of juicy grapefruit. Some pine as well. A really crisp citrus smell with some nice malt in the background. A really great smelling beer.  T- Once again a ton of grapefruit and some resiny pine. The malt backbone in this is perfect. Just barely tames the bitterness from the fresh hops. Its what makes this different than other Sierra Nevada IPA/PA offerings. One of the most pleasant tasting beers i've had.  M- So drinkable. Not too creamy and some great carbonation.  O- I can't speak highly enough of this beer. Its not the best beer I've ever had but its definitely one of the most enjoyable to drink. Every Christmas I grow to love this beer more and more. It is Sierra Nevada's best beer IMO. It is perfectly balanced in a West Coast IPA kinda way. It is super drinkable and unique. I hear people say this is overrated but I personally think its underrated. What a treat. Worth the wait..  Edit: 2018 is the best version And best beer I have ever had. Run to the store.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Labeorphile,3.95,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured too strong the first time and ended up with a 3 inch head. Grabbed a second bottle and maybe poured a little light, didn't end up with much head, but what was there was nice and sticky with little bubbles coming up to support.  Nice coppery color and strong scent of pine, typical of Sierra Nevada. Not my favorite hop variety, but what is there is very strong in the nose.  Solid flavor that matches the hop aroma, especially on the back end. Much more muted and balanced than I expected, based on the aroma. A hint of secondary bitterness late in the back that I don't care for. Mouth feel is about right for an IPA.  Overall a good beer. I prefer the Stone ales to the Sierra Nevada's given the hops used, but this is one of the better SN offerings I have had.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,gentlystewed,4.61,"Tis the season can mean a lot of different things to different people, but to me, I think not of candy canes, shopping malls, annoying as shit carols, or eggnog; I now think of Sierra Nevada Celebration. I poured this one into a Samuel Adams pint glass. The body has a dark rich copper color to it that's topped off with a massive beige pillow of fluffy goodness that sinks some but not much. The aroma seems dominated by grapefruit, and pine, but lurking not to far behind comes the fruity, caramel sweetness. The hop bitterness cuts through your tongue and shatters the jaw, then mercifully lays flat a thin layer of sweetness. The mouthfeel is thin to medium. Overall this is my favorite seasonal. Another great one from the mighty Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,axeman9182,4,"12 oz bottle, 2012 vintage. It was poured into my Duvel tulip.  Sierra Nevada Celebration pours a dark amber, with a good bit of clarity to it. Just over two fingers of dirty white foam finish off the look, hanging around for a few minutes before leaving chunks of lacing stuck to the glass. The aroma is predominantly grapefruit in character, but a bit of more piney hops manages to sneak into the nose as well. There's a healthy dollop of caramel and candied sugar right up front, before a bitterness intercedes. My first impression is that it's relatively mild, but it does increase in intensity as it moves towards the back of my palate. The hoppy finish is closer to straight floral grapefruit, but there's still a little bit of pine appreciable. The body definitely isn't on the dry end of the spectrum for an IPA. For a beer that's (hopefully) only going to be consumed in the winter months, I don't mind that as much. The carbonation could stand to ""pop"" just a little bit more though. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Sierra Nevada Celebration, but I don't quite see what makes some of my beer geek brethren go crazy about it either.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Even on a careful pour there's quite a bit of head, which I don't favor but overlook for this one. Smells dam good toffee, caramel, oak amongst others. Taste, Dam good. That's why I drink it. Does have a grapefruit ending, slightly bitter. Overall I look forward to this one. Slightly heavy a sixer tops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Jsteez,4.36,"Poured from a 12 oz. botttle into a dimpled beer mug.  A-Poured a cloudy, medium amber color, with an orange hue. The off-white head was creamy, 1.5 inches, and thick! The head dissipated into a fluffy white surface that gave this beer an incredible mouthful! A nice sticky lace was left on the glass. This beer was one the best IPA's I have seen!  S-Grapefruity with citrus undertones. I could really smell the American whole cone hops. Very balanced smell. There were also traces of sweet malt as well.  T-Just like the smell, grapefruit, pine, citrus, whole cone hops, and a nice balance of sweet malt. The aftertaste left a bitter hop taste that created a dry feel. This was balanced by the sweet malt on the initial taste of the brew. There were also traces of that spicy X-mas taste you can find in mulled wine. Great winter brew. It was so nicely balanced that the higher ABV was not noticeable.  M-This was a full-bodied brew with a crisp and dry finish that also felt a little light. Balanced and nice.  Overall, I recommend this brew to those that love IPA's with a spicy holiday twist. Sierra Nevada never disappoints. Try this with spicy Thai food. You'll be highly satisfied. This may sound strange, but try it while eating a grapefruit or an orange. You'll be surprised. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Googs,4.33,"Bottle poured into a pint glass. My first time having this one, I love Sierra Nevada and I have high hopes.  A: Pours with a big off white head which turns into a 1/4 of nice bubbles. Golden amber body, great carbonation Lacing on the glass. This is a sexy brew so far.  S: Hop forward smell. Citrus and earthy, floral and pine aroma. A bit of sweet bread and tiny bit of booze.  T: On the bitterness scale this is not off the hook, it's quite balanced and that's why I love it. Good malt backbone. Your getting the sweet pale and cara malts and then the rich citrus and hop bite. Not tasting alcohol.  M: Medium body, well carbonated and very smooth. Not sticky. Bitterness is present, it hits, covers up the booze and stays on the palate. I drank this one pretty fast, wish I had more to get saucy on.  O: This beer is great. Drinkable and full of flavor at a good price. I'm a hophead but I lean towards the more balanced IPAs and DIPAs and this is one of those. Think I'll get a six pack.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T - Taste is sweet, bready malt and a piney hop flavor.  M - Mouthfeel is average.  O - Overall, I would say this one of my least favorite IPA’s. A little to much bitterness for the amount of hop flavor and aroma. It also has a lingering piney bitterness that I feel could be better supported by more flavor and aroma hops or more of a malt backbone.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dfillius,4.18,"Poured into a pint A: Moderate pour yields 1.25 finger of tight orange-tan head with great retention. Clear copper liquid has maybe the slightest haze to it. S: Caramel, toasted marshmallow, orange/creamsicle, citrus hops. Juicy and sweet, slight esters. Solid and multi-dimensional T: Hops bite in the finish and the start. Piney and grapefruit hop character. Some savory-ness. Alstroms say tobacco - I kind of get that. So solid. A bit maltier and more caramelized than I like my AIPAs, but not over the top. Good for the season. M: Bitter through and through. Almost chewy. Almost punishingly bitter in the late finish. O: Glad to keep buying 6 of these each year! I'll have another!

This is a classic west coast amber that almost makes theleap into an IPA.  T - Tangy citrus fruits is the first flavor that stand out. There are some notes of spice before settling in with some strong bitter notes.  M - Balance on this is incredible and manages to temper the hop profile with some good old west coast malt. This is a joy to drink and while the flavor profile is storn it just seems to be mellow enough to enjoy.  O - Not sure if I'd pick this as my first choice for a Chirstmas beer.

140,1904,TheSeeker61,4.08,Waited a year to try this one as I saw it last season but didn't get a chance to try it. Poured a finger head with an amber color. Good lacing on the glass. Smelled mostly malty with slight hops. The tongue begins with a hint of malts then moves into centennial hops which is fine with me. A nice bitter/grapefruit finish. Has an average mouthfeel which is good for the style. Overall it was worth the wait and an interesting IPA.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,micromaniac129,4.27,"Been drinking this beer for years and never had it on tap, so when I seen it at TJ Smiths I jumped at it. And it's just like the bottled version. It had the same ruby copper amber color but had gentile carbonation and a smallish head. Aroma were the same loads of fresh hops and sutle malts. Taste was quite hoppy and bold and bitter with a good dose of malts to rein in the hops a bit. Drank refreshingly smooth with a clean dry and somewhat bitter aftertaste. One of my top 5 favorite beers still after all these years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MaineBrewing,4.38,"A - poured into a pint glass and got a huge head with only a normal pour. Head is beautiful, frothy, leaving sticky lace as it subsides. The head and lacing is a huge plus for this ipa. Doesn't look like something that came out of a 12 pack that was affordable and easy to obtain. Thank you Sierra Nevada! Oh yeah, and the color is good too, very clear, a shade past amber into brown, or amber with brown hints. Who cares. It looks delicious.  S - bottle nose consisted of beautiful grapefruit, lemon, and pine hop character with brown sugar in the background.... After pour it is more of the same, intense inviting citrus and pine hops with slight malt and brown sugar background.  T - very hop forward piney, floral, citrus, and resin... Hints of spicyness, probably another character attributed to the hops instead of a spice addition. Im glad this winter seasonal doesn't load random spices into it trying to be christmas in a cup, its just a really well crafted ipa. Caramel malts are present along with an ever so slight brown sugar taste making me feel like this is indeed more of a winter seasonal ipa.  M - medium somewhat sticky, carbonation was on par for ipa, very easy drinking. Very dangerously sessionable.  Overall - overall a great ipa, massive hop nose and flavor with a medium body that is drinkable in the colder months. I will certainly return next year for the celebration!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,biboergosum,4.03,"12oz bottle, many thanks to DoktorZee for fulfilling a longtime beer want of mine for Christmas 2012.  This beer pours a slightly hazy, medium bronzed amber hue, with three fingers of rocky, chunky off-white head, which leaves some decent fuzzy cogwheel lace around the glass as it slowly sinks away.  It smells of somewhat musty citrus rind and pine tips, lightly toasted bready caramel malt, a touch of toffee, and softly sassy grassy hops. The taste is more orange and grapefruit pithy fruitiness, a wee bit of lemongrass, some leafy spruce resin, and a somewhat overmatched bready, almost crackery malt, the caramel morphing into a echo of lingering expectation.  The carbonation is averagely competent, being all that I want it to be, the body a sturdy, just reconstructed medium weight, and smooth with that tacit acknowledgement of hoppy interlopers. It finishes off-dry, sure, but in a general, brown sugar sense, as the various hoppy notes play on and on and on.  I may have just given off an air of hop fatigue, but that's just not the case. What is true, however, is my weariness of late of brewers who claim an all-satisfying balance in their big-ass bitter offerings, in the hope of worldwide acceptance, I suppose, when nothing of the sort is actually on offer. So, to summarize, this is indeed a pretty stellar IPA, but there's nothing particularly wintery, in terms of malt-upsizing, about it. Glad to have finally made its acquaintance, though, certainly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Powderhornphil,4.03,"2012 bottle.  Pours a deep caramel orange with about two to three fingers of white fluffy head. Receded to leave some appealing lacing.  Smells of bready malts, citrus hops, maybe some light pine way in the back.  Tastes sweet breadiness, followed by caramel, then earthy, citrus hops. Finished with a nice hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is pretty light and easy drinking. Medium to low carbonation. Leaves just the right amount of sticky coating that I like in my IPAs.  Nice offering from SN here. Reasonably priced and sessionable. Nothing too extreme, just a well balanced and very tasty beer.  .",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Pours a dark orange with about one and a half finger beige head that retains a nice layer and leaves a good bit of lacing.  Smells of orange, pine, grapefruit and grass.  Tastes of piney and tropical hops with biscuit, mild pepper and citrus rind.  Slick medium feel with tingly moderate carbonation. Long dry bitter finish.  I don't seem to like this quite as mich as many folks do but I'm certainly down with at least a six pack each season.

140,1904,ThisWangsChung,3.68,"2011 scores: (4.0/3.5/3.0/3.0/3.0)  I always felt I never gave this one a fair shake, so here goes nothing. 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a hazy copper color with middling clarity. The head is a nice two finger light cream color with excellent texturing. Ultimately, the head settles down to one finger, and leaves impressive patchwork lacing on the glass.  S: There are the typical floral, piny, and vaguely citrusy hops I expect from most SN IPAs, but here the hops also seem to take on a spruce character that I find rather enticing. Centennial hops are very aromatically evident with lemongrass notes. Concentration will yield a bit of sweet, graham cracker-like maltiness.  T: Last year, I found this too bitter, but this year, I'd say it's bang on in terms of balancing between hops and malts. Similar to the aroma, Centennial hops seem to be in the forefront, opening the flavor profile with lemongrass and pine. Both the midtaste and finish are pleasantly malty, with only a slightly bitter aftertaste. At times, this really does evoke a Christmas tree in liquid form - and that's a good thing. Only real problem are vague distractions of dish soap here and there.  M: A bit on the heavy side in terms of texture, with a rather clean and dry finish. Carbonation is on the lower side of medium. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary in terms of a typical IPA, but it matches the flavor profile well.  O: I'm glad I gave this a second chance, because now I can see what the fuss is about. While by no means my favorite IPA, it's a damn fine Christmas-time staple. Probably my second favorite vessel for Centennial hops behind Bell's Two Hearted.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

M: Pretty full mouthfeel. A bit more carbination than I'd like. Goes down smooth and very clean. O: Good , solid IPA. Doesn't get too ridiculous with the hopping. Well balanced.

Slight alcohol aroma/flavor  M-Medium dry, soft carbonation  O-Great IPA example, assertively bitter and dry in the west coast style. Hop aroma is somewhat low.

Nice high level of astrigency and moderate bitterness with a nice sweet malt backbone  M- Very dry, prickly carbonation, medium body, almost creamy in its smoothness  O- One of the first craft beers I really fell in love with. I can't believe I have not reviewed it yet. Picked up a six pack for $6.99 and it certainly does not disappoint.

Citrus then comes through pretty strong. It leaves a bitter resinous hop flavor on the tongue.  M- Medium-high carbonation, medium body.  Overall a decent IPA.

Almost two months, and the first I see of it in the Utah system. Woohoo, Utah, wer'e number 1! /sarc  Poured into my perfect pint. Huge smells coming off of this one even before I stick my nose in it.  Appearance: Glorious billowy, three finger off white head on top of a slightly hazy amber liquid. Very nice! Lace all the way down.  Smell: Huge pine and citrus hop smells. I am sure there are malts in there, but the hops kind of rule here.  Taste: A nice charge of bitterness really takes hold of the tongue with pine and orange flavors. I am having a hard time picking out the malt, but I can ""feel"" it back there.  Mouthfeel: No problems. Carbonation is smooth and middling, while the body is rich and almost thick. Flavors coat the mouth easily and do not let up during the long finish.

140,1904,Schwerzpunkt,3.45,"Serving Type: Bottle poured into a tulip  Appearance: Crystal clear. Almost a cross between orange and amber. Head was thick, pillowy, and quite large. Off-white in color, it disappeared rapidly, leaving ample, film-like lacing on the sides of the glass, aswell as a thin blanket on top of the beer.  Smell: A well-balanced mix of malts and hops. Piny aroma was clearly evident and quite strong, however, notes of sweet caramel and toffee, aswell as a slightly bready aroma from the malts also shone and helped to even things out.  Taste: Much like the smell, the flavor of this beer was well-balanced. Hoppy bitterness and a strng flavor of pine were the stars of the show here, yet they were balanced nicely by a strong malt backbone. As with the aroma, there were notes of sweet caramel and toffee as well as a biscuity, bready flavor.  Mouthfeel: This was the most impressive part of the beer for me. It was perfectly medium-bodied, with just the right amount of moderate carbonation. This beer had just the right amount of substance that it was not either too watery or too heavy/syrupy. Very refreshing and very drinkable.  Overall: It was a good beer. Well balanced, refreshing, moderate in just about every area. However, on the downside, the only area it really stood out in for me, was the mouthfeel. It's stuck in the limbo of being good, but nothing special. Nothing really jumped out or wowed me. In my opinion its overhyped and would not be touted so highly if it were a year round brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Ethanol4one,4.45,"I like this little jack in the box ale that pops up each winter about the time everyone is rushing around buying stuff on black Friday. Very hoppy on the nose approach, and it fulfills the promise on the bitter hop aftertaste, mixed with a little spice, but nothing heavy like the spruce or pumpkin ales I make in my buckets for the season.  Smooth, slightly malt, less attenuated than many IPAs now. Don't know that hops, but would venture Citra. I could wiki it, but that would be cheating. However I encourage you to look it up. The hops are kind of cheesy, but in a good way, like licking your fingers after that brand of corn chips w/ cheese everyone seems to enjoy.

Nice.  Taste: I think I've died. This must be the afterlife. As echoed by many others here, this one isn't very balanced, but great nonetheless. The hops cut through everything else, but a spicy maltiness is present as well as some grapefruit citrus. Adult candy.  Mouthfeel: Medium-heavy body with a smoothness that's top-notch.  Overall: Wow... I've seen this beer hyped in the forum so I had to try it. No disappointment here. It might be in my top three favorites now. I'll have to see how I feel after the next five of them. My guess is fantastic. (Note: I am a hophead. If you are not, you won't like it as much.) Getcha some!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smells of pine and citrus. Very refreshing and, well, celebratory. Excellent mouthfeel. A little oily, hoppy, and some malt--an excellent balance. Wonderful. A bite, too, but a pleasant bite.

I got my 6 pack with the seasonal artwork showing a nice cabin in the mountains covered in snow. Then I walked outside into the nice 70 degree December weather. My house isn't covered in snow, but I like hops any time of year, and this one has ""fresh"" hops. That's pretty much all I taste.

A really balanced scent, if such a thing is possible.  T: Caramel malts hit up front, completely unexpected from an IPA. The hops start creeping in after, lots of pine and a hint of citrus. Nice bitter back end without over doing it. Definitely some yeast flavors going on that I can't pin down.  M: The ABV is hidden perfectly. Has a great full body and low carbonation, which really lets the full palate shine.  O: I can't find a fault with this beer.

Chewy. Smoother and less carbonated than I thought it'd be.  Well balanced. Bitterness lingers long after the sip.

I get a bit of yeast smell.  T: I get a biscuit flavor which is met with a pine-like flavor right after. It is fairly bready and grainy tasting, which works well with the hop flavor. It's not a slam in the face of hops, but it is right where it needs to be.  M: The mouthfeel is a bit chewy if that makes sense. It is brightly carbonated, medium bodied, and bitter enough. It feels a bit overcarbonated for my tastes, but that is a personal preference.  O: Overall I think that if a person is into IPA's or hoppy beers, this is a good celebratory beer for them!

They don't mention on the package that it's pitched with yeast which gives it a great taste similar to a belgian IPA.

There's lots of retention that leaves tons of lacing.  I take a whiff and get lots of citrus like that of grapefruit with piney hops.... It's also a bit spicy with the slightest sweetness like that of caramel.  The taste is similar with a bunch of citrus, spices, hoppiness, and some sweet malts.  I'd say this I a medium-bodied brew with tons of carbonation.... It has a crisp spiciness with a slight creaminess going down.... The finish is a bit dry.  Overall, I love this beer....

S: Some decent pine with citrus and some spiciness that I can't quite place.  T: Pine primarily with some sweet orange marmalade and a hint of resin. Bit of caramel and then turns bitter in the middle and into the finish. Pine carries through the aftertaste with the tiniest bit of resin. Some spice lingers in the aftertaste, almost peppery sometimes but mainly pine.  M: Medium bodied, pretty standard fare.  O: Quite a decent IPA. Nice combination of pine and citrus.

Fresh baked bread maltiness adds to the overall warmth of the brew topped off with honey, caramel, and brown sugar.  M: Medium mouthfeel with a good amount of prickling carbonation.

140,1904,Maxwell,3.89,"Celebration pours a beautiful dark amber caramel, bordering on ruby and brown. The beer has a fantastic creamy white head with the faintest tan hints, and it lasts forever, sitting two fingers width up from the beer. The beers body is hazy with carbonation bubbles, but clear of sediment. Lacing is fat and sticky, sliding down the glass slowly and leaving some nice fangs and walls on the side of my glass. This beer looks festive and gorgeous. On the nose the beer smells superbly piney, like a Canadian forest. Rich sweet pine notes meld with almost-cloying sweet caramel malts to hint at some alcohol spice. This smell is what a classic American IPA should smell like. The beer tastes sweet with a wonderful pulpy bitter pine and grapefruit marriage. As the beer enters the mouth and moves over the tip of the tongue the almost-cloying sweet caramel malt plays strongly, but that is swiftly met by the mouth biting bitters, which are not too strong, but are definitely present to bring strong grapefruit and pine flavors into the mouth to stay. The bitters almost bring the flavor into medicinal and stale bread flavors, and definitely walk a fine line as they touch upon the flavor thresholds, but maintain the more appealing tastes of pine and grapefruit, and thus provide a lovely refreshing taste. On the mouth, the beer feels medium bodied with some creamy carbonation and a nice bitter bite that tingles on the tongue. The mouth is left quite dry with islands of sticky saliva and a little astringency left on the tongue. Overall this is a very solid American IPA. Is this the libation of the holiday gods as some people would have you think? No, of course not, it is just a solid example of the classic American IPA, and a perfect time-machine to when the American IPA was first rising as a style. A solid go to drink that is relatively cheap and easy to find. The beer is perfect for those looking for a bitter bite, but it really isn’t amazing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S-Not the greatest smell in the world. Was really hoping for more here. I do get a faint smell of spice, hard candy,  T- Very smooth and balanced beer. I get a slight taste of spice, but thought by what my friends had said I would get more. I do get a bread after taste more similar to a pale ale. Taste the hops, but really not there. I get more of the malt taste.  M- The mouthful is nice. Very clean. Not too thin, good medium body beer.  O- I guess I was expecting a bit more. I think I will have to update my review after a few more of these. My friends raved so much about this beer, but I guess it is just above average for me. It is very well balanced and easy to drink.

140,1904,BlackBelt5112203,4.11,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass at fridge-cellar temperature.  L – Deep amber color with a big 4-finger tan frothy head. Excellent retention and tremendous lacing. Clear with a good amount of bubbles. Sierra Nevada never gets this part wrong.  S – Some caramel malt and lots of hops with grapefruit, pineapple, and mango aromas.  T – Starts off sweet with toasty and caramel malt but rapidly shifts to strong hop bitterness with grapefruit and tropical fruit notes at first and then spicy and piney flavors more towards the finish. For an ordinary IPA (not a DIPA), this is packed with hops, but it becomes more balanced as it warms.  F – Medium-bodied with good carbonation, a sticky and chewy mouthfeel, and a very bitter, spicy, and dry finish. Grapefruit and pine hop bitterness and spice linger very nicely. There’s maybe a little bit of warmth from the alcohol, but that may just be the hop spice.  O – This is a great IPA. You get the same blast of hops that you would get from a DIPA without the ABV. I was expecting this one to be a bit more balanced due to the darker color, but the sweet malts come out more as the beer warms. I’m glad that Sierra Nevada puts out an IPA in the winter time; it’s a nice switch from the much darker and heavier beers that tend to go hand-in-hand with the colder months. This is a very tasty and drinkable brew that has enough hop bite to warm you up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: Taste is very mellow with a slight citrus-y character and notes of grassy hops. Finishes slightly bitter with a little maltiness and a nice peppery/spice flavor that lingers on the back of the tongue.  M: Not too thick, and not too thin. The mouthfeel on this beer is great, with the right amount of carbonation and a slight creaminess on the tongue.  O: This is a solid brew, though it doesn't really live up to all the hype that it gets on the site. Its hop profile is pretty bland for an IPA, and the only real saving grace is the nice bitter/peppery finish that lingers in the mouth afterwards.

140,1904,milwaukee512,4.94,"It is truly a celebration when this beer comes out each year. Very unique in that I've never had an IPA that seems perfectly suited for winter; citrus hops and floral notes, but strong (slightly dark) malt balances it perfectly. Throw in the usual spectacular Sierra Nevada feel and quality, and you've got a one-of-a-kind standout, and a crazy value at the price.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,johnso98,4.19,"The first time I had celebration was in a growler. I liked the balance MUCH better that way than from the bottle, but I have this bottle now, so here it goes:  The label claims that this beer is a ""fresh hop"" IPA with a hint of pine. From the initial smell, the citrus hops are noticeable. In the bottled version, the pine makes all the difference in the taste - think about the character of oak barrel beers. As for the growler, the color and taste is clearer and the sweet malts are much more pronounced. Toward the bottom of the bottle, the hoppy taste is less noticable and the other flavors tend to stick out a bit more.  For an IPA, the mouthfeel is average, but that's not a bad thing. It is true to the style.  The taste is complex enough to try this time of year. I'd recommend getting it on tap somewhere; but if you like IPAs, the bottle is just fine. In this price range, Sierra Nevada is hard to beat.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BenjaminBlondbeard,4.38,"Celebration pours a dark golden brown with almost an inch of head that is cream in color, with sturdy froth. There is ample, and steady carbonation that rises vigorously throughout the clean rich hues of the ale. As you drink, the head contributes to heavy lacing that sticks to the glass; marking libations.  I can detect a hop spice that is piney, and faint toasted malt notes.  Sweet malty IPA! This medium bodied ale comes on with instant carbonation that directly imparts hop spice of sweet pine and subtle citrus fruit. It leaves a crisp clean mouth without losing the resonating flavors the brew imparts. Makes me think of an imperial style with more carbonation, and malt flavor. The peppery bitters rise in the finale, and the subtle malts maintain balance throughout, There is a nice resiny citrus hop spice that lingers on the pallet afterwards. It is balanced throughout by the toasty malts.  In my humble opinion, Sierra Nevada rarely goes wrong, and their Celebration Ale is no exception. I look forward to this brew every year, and I am always satisfied with a nice lightly roasted IPA for the winter time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,boilermakerbrew,4.36,"A- Pours a deep golden to almost light amber color. Thick, dense head of about 2 fingers and slightly off white color. Retention and lacing is phenomenal. Slight haze with some evidence of the bottle conditioning.  S- Pretty straight forward with big pine notes. Reminds me of SN Hoptimum scent, with both using whole cones. Pine notes are present throughout, with other, more floral hops peeking in a little bit.  T- Flavor is pretty much the same as the scent. Also very similar to Hoptimum. Starts with a big bang of hops bitterness, but quickly adds in a solid malt flavor. Malt is definitely secondary, but is present with hints of caramel and lighter malts. Ends with a slight hops bite that linger on the tongue.  M- Pretty much standard IPA here. High carbonation, no detectable alcohol heat, and medium body. Hop profile might make extended drinking problematic, but overall a very sessionable beer.  Overall, a very enjoyable seasonal IPA. Whole cone hops give it a distinct flavor similar to SN Hoptimum. It's a shame this is just a seasonal, as it is a good everyday IPA. Price is very reasonable and even better for the quality of the brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The nose is floral hops with a maple/caramel finish to keep everything round..  The first few sips had me saying to myself ; wow this is a nice, above avg IPA.. But then the clean hops step aside just far enough to reveal a lovely caramel, sweet finish.. This beer improves with each sip and is very easy to drink.  I am thoroughly impressed with this beer..

Celebration reminds me of SN Torpedo but has a fresher hops complexity so I find it a little more bitter than Torpedo but I find I love the hops bitterness. The taste lingers in your mouth for quite a while but its a good flavor so I don't mind it at all. It is a strong beer at 6.8% so it does creep up on you and can hit you hard but its a slow sipper so I know when to stop and take it easy.

140,1904,rev3rb,4.3,Bottom Line Up Front: I really like this IPA from Sierra Nevada and I look forward to it every year. It is a very balanced IPA that makes it incredibly drinkable.  Decanted 12oz bottle into a Guinness goblet.  Apperance: Nice deep golden color that has a good head and light lacing around the glass.  Smell: Wonderful floral and citrus hop aroma that doesn't overwhelm the nose.  Taste: I think the hop and malts really balance each other out. Very nice citrus and some pine hop flavors.  Mouthfeel: This beer is very balanced and smooth on the palate. The carbonation is quite appropriate for this beer.  Overall: I really enjoy this beer and consider this a great IPA. It's very nice clean and crisp with a pleasant mild aftertaste. I consider this IPA very balanced in every category and extremely drinkable.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,THANAT0PSIS,4.01,"Sierra Nevada Celebration  Appearance: Sierra Nevada’s highly regarded Christmas seasonal offering pours a beautiful dark amber color with a glorious two-and-a-half fingers of a creamy, large-bubbled head sitting atop the festive-looking liquid. This crown takes quite a long time to dissipate into a nice, heady crust. The glass is also filled with sediment. This is one of the cloudiest beers out there that this drinker has beheld, sediment-wise. The lacing on this one is also out of this world. There are no alcohol legs to speak of, and a steady stream of mild carbonation streams from the bottom of the glass, maintaining the crust. As with all Sierra Nevada beers, the appearance on this one is at the top of its game.  Aroma: There is lots of biscuity, bready, toasty malt here, which forces the hops to play second fiddle. There is plenty of earthiness to the nose as well. Of course, being a Sierra Nevada offering, this beer has a degree of hoppiness to it. Here, it is all pine, all day. Sure, there are some citrus and grapefruit notes here and there, and perhaps it is the trees on the label, but pine is the dominant smell. Yeast is notable as well, an oddity that is usually not present in Sierra Nevada beers. Unfortunately, there is that unpleasant metallic aroma that usually appears in Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, that causes one to recoil. Still, this one smells really great overall.  Taste: The hops come through a lot more in the mouth than they did in the nose, and this is a wonderful thing. There are piney notes and grapefruit notes primarily, and the hops of course give a bitterness. This is backed up by a more than formidable maltiness, mostly in the form of delicious caramel, but the taste is opposite the nose in that the hops overpower here, but coming from Sierra Nevada, that is not a bad thing.  Mouthfeel: Sadly, this is where this beer falls slightly short. There is nothing really wrong or offensive about the mouthfeel, but it is almost painfully average. It errs just a bit on the watery and thin side, but the carbonation is pleasing and exactly where it should be. The hops give a minimal astringency, and there is just a touch of creaminess/syrupyness, which is very odd considering the medium-thin initial mouthfeel.  Overall: This is one of the great, widely available seasonals. It is definitely outside the norm of winter seasonals, but it is deliciously drinkable, nicely warming, sweet, bitter, just everything one can look for in a good beer, and everything one expects from a Sierra Nevada beer. The mouthfeel holds it back from true greatness, but really the beer tastes great, smells delicious, and looks fantastic. Buy yourself a case of this and go into hibernation for the winter; you will thank me (and everyone else who will inevitably recommend this brew) later. 16.5/20",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The head fades slowly over time to give a decent level of lacing.  Smell – The aroma is heaviest of some biscuit malt, hop, and a spice. The spice is light overall with the hop aromas are of a pine and grapefruit citrus in nature.  Taste – The taste starts with a bready and roasted flavor. A light sweetness of fruit and caramel is present upfront, which fades as the taste advances further. Spice and hop flavors soon come to the tongue. The spice flavors are the light just as the nose would have suggested and with the loss of some of the sweetness and the new presence of a pine and grapefruit hop flavors, bring a bitter spiced and bready flavor to linger on the tongue at the very end of the taste.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is medium in thickness with a carbonation level that is quite average. Not bad for the roasted and spiced flavors of the brew with the moderate carbonation level maintaining a good drinkability.  Overall – A decent brew. A little bitter for a winter brew, as the bitterness and the spice don’t meld perfectly, but overall not bad.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,williamjbauer,4.07,"2012 vintage, bottled served in a weizen glass  A - clear bronze-golden amber with 2 finger egg shell bubbly head with good retention and great sticky lacing  S - pungent grapefruit hops with plenty great piney notes and caramel malts and a touch of booze.  T - one of the great widely distributed seasonal beers, a truly classic winter ipa experience. Loaded with a blast of citrus and piney wet hops balance with bold sweet caramel sugary malts that stick to the top of my palate. The pine favors promenade as the beer warms and the booze is present but not overwhelming and help to take the bite off the earthy bitter finish.  M - medium body, moderate carbonation, a bit chalky.  O - a great year for celebration, I love picking this one up every year, going to age a few and see how it mellows in the spring. This is a must grab for any hops lover.

As the head bubbled away massive chunks of lacing clung to the glass.  s - fresh hops with a nice balance of nutty malt backbone.  t - much like the nose suggests this one is chock full of fresh hops and a great balanced malt backbone to keep it real. Good caramel notes crossed with dank wet fresh hops. Not a hophead's IPA, but a solid approachable IPA none-the-less.  m - even carbonation, medium bodied, just an easy drinker and a fan favorite.  o - overall, like many, I love celebration season.

T/M: Hoppy and bitter at the start, with a malty finish that balances out the hops. Pine, citrus, some caramel. The hops come in waves of rich, very bright and clean flavor. Very creamy mouthfeel.  O: This is an updated review, because either the Celebrations I had last year were sub-par, or I was just crazy - I've updated this from a good beer to a great one, pretty much as good as the Torpedo.

The 2012 just came out, which I will get and review as well.  A: This beer pours a dark orange color with a 1 1/2 inch soapy off white head, which almost overflowed out of my glass.  S: I get an initial aroma of grapefruit and pine, with some hop characteristics. Very potent smell that is complimented by some sweetness from honey and malts.  T: Very earthy taste consisting of grapefruit and pine up front. As I get into the flavor I get a dryness from the yeast and sweetness from the malts.  M: Very sweet flavor, a bit tangy, but the hop bite is not severe. Minimal carbonation, but very sessionable.  O: This is the 2011 Celebration ale, so it might have lost some of its characteristics over the course of the year, but I didnt notice. I got a very quality IPA, and from Sierra Nevada, I would expect nothing less than quality. Did not disappoint, even after aging a year.

140,1904,HoppyPeteSkolnik31,3.21,"On tap at Keystone in Whitehall, PA  A: Nice amber color with a thick head which helped to develop the lacing throughout the beer.  S: My nose was filled with malt, not hops which was a bit surprising after reading reviews that labeled this beer a hopheads delight.  M: The feel of this beer was rather full, led by that more malty than hoppy character which I really didn't expect.  T: The taste was similar to the smell, earthy malt and earthy hops. Not what I thought it would be, but not fully disappointing.  O: Don't think I'll be going back to this one and possibly not back to any Sierra Nevada IPAs again. In my opinion, each has been overrated for my taste. I consider myself to be quite the hophead and I have been let down by this beer as well as the Torpedo in the past. From the reviews I thought I'd love this beer. From my personal taste, it wasn't what I'd hoped.

Top is pockmarked, lacing all around (sometimes chunks of it). Body is a light orange. Simply gorgeous.  Smell: Hint of pineapple, sweet hops, pine, orange, very good aroma.  Taste: Pine cones, sweetish grapefruit, high on citrus fruit, good back and forth with the malt & hops.  Mouthfeel: Body is focused, uncluttered, simple yet strong, bitter yet not abrasively so.

At first it was seriously bitter with a lot of flavors swirling around in the background. The most prominent to me was a pine flavor with a hint of grapefruit and a metallic aftertaste. I let it sit for a few minutes and tried it again, which resulted in more grapefruit and less bitter pine taste, so I'm thinking I may have tried it too cold.

140,1904,Cobrito,4.48,"Thank God Sierra still doesn't feel the need to make Celebration a crowd pleaser. Instead the 2012 is a hophead's delight, with significant bitterness and a chewy mouthfeel that will be rough on some palates.

S: Citrus up front, withthe pine following right behind, mingling slightly with the citrus, for a pleasant, hoppy aroma that I can only describe as California. Usual ""Beer""taste smell somewhat present, but masked. Alcohol not very apparent in the aroma. T: Pine leads the flavor charge, followed closely by citrus, in a reversal of the aroma, decent malt presence makes this a very enjoyable brew, a bit more balanced than the Torpedo made by the same brewery. M: A bit on the lighter side, considering the amount of flavor and alcohol in this beer. Could be deceptive to those not accustomed to IPAs O: Easy to see why they release this brew during the winter time.

140,1904,Bubbalito,4.48,"Sierra Nevada “Celebration” Fresh Hop Holiday Ale: Pour = Perfect tarnished copper hue, very translucent which allows you to see the jet stream of bubbles streaming off the bottom of the glass. A giant fluffy cloudlike head, leaving a ton of lace style bubbles along the sides of my glass Smell = Just a ton of big citrus smells, I get a lot of pineapple at first followed by some bitter, yet bright grapefruit. When you take a nice big whiff you get the candy like sweet caramel in the back. Smells fresh and alive. Taste = Balance is all I can say, no one flavor really pops out or overpowers, it is just a very nice blend of grapefruit, pinapple, some other tropical fruits mixed with nice soft caramel flavors, followed on the back end by a little peppery bite. The carbonation gives you a little tingle on the tongue that wakes up your tastebuds, and then a very dry and bitter finish leaving you wanting to take another sip. Overall = A very sought after, yet pretty available Winter Seasonal. It breaks the mold from most winter seasonals’ by not being a complete malt bomb (which are awesome at this time of the year as well). Just a nice “fresh hop” IPA with just the right amount of maltiness to taste right when it is sub 40 degrees outside.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JamesMN,3.5,"Appearance: Slightly hazy dark golden hue with a one finger gray/white bubbly head.  Aroma: Caramel malt and english barley. Some earthy hop notes.  Taste: Very earthy hops with a nice barley/caramel malt taste. Dead on with the aroma with the addition of bitterness which is at a nice moderate level. The earthy hop profile does give off a certain 'winter seasonal' feel which is nice. No spices but the hops themselves have a piny, spiciness that works in its favor. However, not nearly as hoppy given the description (and on the hype). Dry finish like you'd expect from an IPA. Nice balance.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with average effervescence and drinkability.  Final Thoughts: Hmm, not impressed with this one (in general I'm not a huge East Coast IPA with a few exceptions). I guess all the hype plays against it in a way because I wasn't expecting such a humble beer. It is simply a good IPA that doesn't try anything ballsy and delivers a fulfilling, if not memorable, experience. Would I drink it again? I will return to it for next years release but glad I didn't opt for the sixer this time around.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Sweet biscuity malts, slit alcohol aroma - 4.0  T- Follows the nose, caramel malts are more apparent and they bring to the table that awesome sierra taste. The hops are still the stars here and though i'm tired of cascade, when fresh hopped, they're always amazing, plus sierra adds other supporting hops, limiting the cascade to a lingering grapefruit bitterness at the end. - 4.5  M- Oily and resiness, just like it should be, nice carbonation - 4.5  O- Someone needs to make a law, that all IPA's must be fresh hopped. Every fresh or wet hopped brew i have tasted, has been amazing. Add a good malt backbone to that and it becomes glorious. When I first had this in 2011, it blew my mind. Though 2012 didn't do the same, it's still an awesome beer. It's somewhat off balanced, but ipa's are meant to let the hops do the talking, and that's fine by me. - 4.5  2012 score out of 5: 4.38  2011 Vintage  My aunt gave me 3 bottles of it when i visited her for thanksgiving!

Pommegranet, apple, grapefruit hit the nose with an awesome sweet metalic malt backbone. The taste followz the nose, but with a sour citrus note, sweet malts again are the backbone and grapefruit bitterness finishes it off with a slit alcohol twang to close it out.

Pour carefully as this is well carbonated especially for an IPA, my first bottle was particularly lively and had a growing head (I might have accidentally shaken it).  This smells like a multitude of aromatic hops, nice but not amazing.  The taste however is where this brew really shines. The hop bitterness comes together with a slight citrus background coupled with sweetness. Make no mistake however that sweetness doesn't balance out the bitterness this is a bitter one just the way hop heads like it.  Mouthfeel wise it was above average but not legendary.

Great-looking IPA - caramel-amber in colour with a bit of haze, and a damned impressive head that provides stellar sheets of lacing and lasts throughout the whole drink. Awesome.  Pine hops, cracker, caramel, biscuit, citrus (orange peel).  Tasty IPA for sure, with a great balance between the citrus-pine hops and caramel-biscuit maltiness, with the hops lingering after each sip. I'm not sure what exactly is seasonal about this, however, but I do know that this is a fine brew nevertheless. Medium bodied, tart finish, carbonation fairly zippy.  Great brew on its own merits, but again, not sure where the seasonal comes into play here.

A - Pours a dark orange/amber body that is bordering a light brown. Two fingers of a white/khaki head that settles into some solid edging. The lacing and retention is one of the best found in an IPA. Just crazy amount of clinging. Perfect.  S - Resinous pine, bitter grapefruit, caramel malts, and a bit of spice.  T - Caramel malts take center stage as some piney and citrus hops provide some fruit and bitterness. Just a touch of dankness and spice on the finish. Smooth, balanced, robust, delicious. Mouth feel is creamy and well carbonated.  O - Its not the best IPA in the world, but its one of the most consistently great ones. Huge gobs of caramel malt play off of piney and grapefruit heavy hops. The hop profile gives the illusion of an inclusion of subtle but warming winter spices.

Subtle spices permeate the hoppy goodness.  M- Just the right amount of carbonation. Feels great cold but I'd like to try it room temperature or warm as well; I bet the flavors would shine through better that way.  D- I could drink it all night, but after a few one of my stature feels a bit tipsy, owing to the high alcohol content. This is made for cold winter nights after long days of cross-country skiing.

140,1904,Jugs_McGhee,3.55,"Heard all the hype so I picked it up. 6.80% ABV. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle with crown cap acquired at BevMo! and served into a stem-goblet in Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live.  Expectations are fairly high given the hype, but I'm skeptical.  Served refrigerator cold. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a 1.5 finger beige colour head of nice thickness and cream, and good retention for the above average ABV. Body colour is a fairly vibrant copper-amber. Semitransparent. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Decent lacing.  Sm: Toasted amber malts, cream, floral hops, caramel, murky tangerine, and cloying sweetness. Surprisingly malty; I expected an overly hoppy bright aroma. I see now why it's a winter beer. Shaping up to be quite nice so far. An average strength aroma.  T: Pleasant floral hops until the climax, where the hop bitterness breaks through naked, without anything to help hide it. Pleasant toasted malt foundation, with even some cherry fruit up front. Too bitter in the third act, destroying the balance of both the flavour profile and the structure. Nice interplay between hops and malts but the finish just tanks it. I do like it, but I wish the last third could just be snipped away. No yeast or alcohol comes through. Some murky grapefruit and tangerine...where's the bright crisp citrus and pine that I want? It's nowhere to be found here. Drinks like a decently hopped winter warmer. That isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Mf: Too dry and coarse in the third act, but pleasantly smooth and wet up front. A bit sticky and chewy. Good thickness and carbonation. Good presence. Clean.  Dr: Quite drinkable, especially considering the above average ABV. It's an enjoyable little seasonal, but current ratings are obscenely high given the quality here. I'm glad I have a six pack, and I'd try this on draught, but I doubt I'll pick up any next year. A solid macrobrew IPA for what it is, but don't expect it to live up to its current ratings. At this price point and availability, I can see why it makes it into so many refrigerators. But its severe lack of balance really holds it back.  [2017 note: BeerAdvocate's rating system changed the weights of each category with no notice, so I have no idea what rating I originally gave this beer.]  --- 01/24/15: I found the 2014 vintage much more balanced and enjoyable. It had a great hop-forward flavour profile with ample complexity for the style and ABV. I found myself buying multiple 6-packs over the course of the season.  B-  *** 2nd impression:  High C+  *** 11/11/16: 2016 vintage impressions (bottled). 6 pack ran me $9.99 at a beer store in Brooklyn, NY.  Clear copper-amber body. Translucent and transparent. Frothy off-white cap. Nice lacing. ~7 minute retention. Looks decent for an IPA; not the usual vibrant clean copper you'd see.  Aroma hints at toastiness, with a more amber malt-driven malt backbone than most IPAs offer, putting amber malts on equal footing with pale malts. Hop profile is floral, somewhat piney, a little oily, a bit resinous...it caters to eclectic tastes, ticking almost every traditional box in terms of traditional hop aromatics (everything except juicy/citrusy fruity hop notes).  A coating texture and medium body combined with an atypically coarse and dry somewhat dragging presence on the palate give the subtle bubblegum and oily piney hop notes more oomph at the expense of the cleaner floral and resinous hop notes (which would be better accentuated by a more smooth, wet, light feel). A slightly toasty slightly bready amber malt backbone gives this a slightly sweeter taste than most IPAs go for, which plays to its holiday theme to an extent - at the expense of drinkability. Deliberately imbalanced with a chaotic clash of hop bitterness and amber malt toasty sweetness in combination with a rough texture, Celebration is anything but a dialed-in beer, but I nevertheless find myself enchanted by it. It's far from great in terms of traditional style conventions, bending more towards an imperial amber (or heaven forbid a nonsense designation like ""red IPA""), but there's an intangible element that keeps me returning to it year to year...and at a very reasonable $9.99 per sixer, that's easy to do.  B- / WORTHY  *** 10.29.17 bottle impression:  One of the best value IPAs currently on the market, and a beer I always look forward to.  Low B / GOOD  *** 11.05.19 bottle:  Piney and resinous with impeccable balance.  A tasty treat showcasing Centennial to terrific extent.  A bit drier than many IPAs, but it works.  Gives Two Hearted a run for its money in my book.  B+ / GOOD  *** 11/27/20 2020 bottle:  Has a more noticeable doughy yeast profile than I remembered, but the candied orange peel is there. Less overt pine, more floral character. Not as ""wet""/fresh in hop flavour as I remembered, but a nice IPA.  B- / WORTHY",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mikeg67,4,"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a long lasting, fluffy white head and good amount of lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, caramel malt and ripe fruit. Body is medium and crisp.

140,1904,BeerFMAndy,4.8,"12 oz bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada Imperial Pint. 6.8% ABV, 2012  A - Possibly one of the sexiest looking beers ever, a lightly hazy forms over the pumpkin orange-bronze color from the use of whole-cone wet hops. The light taupe head forms a massive pile of foam before slowly retiring to a clumpy plateau. Lace covers so much of the glass it's hard to see through!  S - Very potent aroma from the get-go, there's a lot going on in this beer. A multitude of hops releases a floral nose with spice hints, a touch of pine resin, and a bit of citrusy fruit. There's a hearty amount of malts backing it up too with mellow caramel and honey sweetness drizzled on top of a flaky biscuit.  T - The flavor doesn't have the quite the searing hop punch the nose suggests, though it's still quite strong. Instead, Celebration is very well balanced between the caramel and honey sweet malts and floral and lightly fruity hops for a round and smooth equal opportunity brew. Lots of little nuances such as tropical fruit, grapefruit, and mistletoe come and go with a finish of very light phenol alcohol.  M - The nucleation etching in the glass keeps the bubbles roaring but this medium-bodied beer has a very smooth feel with a round, almost chewy feel and subdued carbonation. Dry and bitter on the finish, the hops really flex their muscles here.  O - Sierra Nevada Celebration doesn't quite encapsulate the holiday feel it's inviting label's landscape suggests, but damn if it isn't an amazing IPA! Celebration honors the harvest as the season shifts to winter. The deep hop and malt flavor begs to be pondered with it's intricacies, inviting the partaker back for yet another sip, time and time again. A snow day and roaring fire would pair perfectly with this winter IPA!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,lordofstarside,4.06,"12oz bottle to a snifter Bottled on Oct 9th. My first bottle of the '12 batch  Pours a deep golden orange with some darker hues towards the top. Clumps of yeast float around the glass and have settled at the bottom of the bottle. Brewed a little over a month ago, there's no real excuse for this. One finger of foam that's receded rather quickly, decent lacing as I swirl it on the sides of the glass  Aroma of hops, pine, and some citrus. Robust malt presence with a sweet bready odor and a tinge of alcohol. Malt is what stands out the most to me here, very reminiscent of SN's hop harvest ales  Taste of strong spicy hop, modest grapefruit, citrus, and pine resin. Malts not as strong as the nose, yet clearly represented- a good thing in this case. Nice bitter finish  Mouth is pretty full bodied for an ipa, with a nice crisp and dry finish. Resin from the hops coat the mouth leaving it sticky, goes down smooth.  Over all a great beer I look forward to every year. For $6.99 a six pack it cannot be beat, will be a staple in my fridge throughout the winter. Incredibly smooth and incredibly bitter",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,thatsfine,4.12,"It's been over a year since my last review. Nice to be back...  A: Poured into my Firestone Walker pint glass, this has a welcoming copper color with an off-white, lingering head which leaves ring after ring of lace down the side of the glass. Well done.  S: Ahh... that's the smell I always look forward to this time of year. Fresh hop IPAs are one of my favorites. Some are overpowering, some are faint, but this is perfect. The familiar dank smell backed up with a solid malt backbone.  T: What I love about Sierra Nevada is their consistency, which is definitely there with this beer. They always offer quality, balanced beers and this is no exception. A great mix of bitter and fruity hops combined with bready malts make a great beer.  M: Just what I expect, a little sticky and medium bodied.  O: I look forward to this every year and it never lets me down.

140,1904,Broden,4.32,"A- Pours a bright copper color into a standard pint. Off white head is nice and fluffy and lingers throughout. Impressive lacing develops as the beer goes down.  S- Beautiful balanced nose of malt and hops. No over the top hop aroma but a nice balance of all of the components.  T- A variety of fruits meet a nice bread flavor. This is all finished with a nice piney flavor and an oily resin as it goes down. A slight hint of alcohol right at the end.  M- Light body, perfect for the style. Finishes quite dry.  O- This is an excellent IPA and balance seems to be the name of the game with this one. Malt, and Hops work together to make this an excellent beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Goblinmunkey7,4.6,"Appearance: Clear, perfectly clear. Amber/copper. Head is off-white, creamy, and has insane retention. Nice sheets and notches of lacing. A bit darker than I would expect from the style, but everything else is about as solid as it gets.  Smell: Nice balance of orange zest and caramel malt sweetness. Mildly bready malts coupled with some pine resin and slick, oily pine. Some nice building herbal notes as well. Leafy, herbal, slightly raw, and fresh hops. It's big, but not aggressive, or huge. Nice overall balance. Mild fruitiness.  Taste: Raw and fresh. Mild herbal spiciness. Pine needles and resin. Oily, slick, and juicy. Orange zest and some grapefruit flesh. Biscuity malts with some cracker-like maltiness in the back. Nice moderate bitterness cleanses some of the leafier/earthier hop notes. Toasted edge fused with some overall malt sweetness. Distinct touches of Sierra Nevada yeast round it all out.  Mouthfeel: This is creamy. Nice moderate carbonation on a medium body. Some dryness.  Overall: Winter is coming!  I drink it by the case. It's not the most aggressive, or the most nuanced, but it's fresh, clean, and so drinkable it's insane.

140,1904,zac16125,4.08,"12oz bottle into a pint glass 2012 vintage, no born on date  A: Pours a crystal clear reddish amber with 2.5 fingers width of light khaki colored head. Good retention and leaves a bunch of really cool zig zag lacing. Beautiful beer.  S: Aroma is a mixture of citrus, pine, and spicy hops. Orange, some sweet caramel malts. Very nice.  T: Maltier than the nose implies. Ton of caramel malt up front. Piney bitterness on the finish. Some sweet citrus in the form of orange and pineapple. Hop flavors come out more as it warms. Nice balance.  M/D: Pretty heavily carbonated, which I usually dont like but it works well here. Medium bodied, a quick drying finish that leaves you longing for the next sip. Drinkability is just absurd, you can practically chug this.  O: This is a beer Ive had a number of times and I will certainly continue to have. Honestly, there is nothing mind blowing about it, but its really solid from start to finish, and something about that extra bit of sweetness and spice give the flavor profile a very ""holiday season"" feel.

140,1904,johnkale,4.13,"2012 Edition - good to reunite with an old friend  12 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams pint  A - hazy red/amber, two fingers of slightly rocky head dissipates to a cap that sticks around, as does lacing on the glass  S - biscuity malt mixes with a little caramel and a lot of grapefruit, pine resin, lemon pith, very bright aromas  T - first taste is sweet, with grapefruit and tangerine along with some earthier bitterness, finish is orange pith and some pine cone, fairly dry at the end, nice transition as it goes down. There's a little alcohol warmth thrown in too, which surprised me considering the ABV, hints of toffee show up initially as it warms but the grapefruit really asserts itself, not Squirt grapefruit sodaesque, but 'it's morning and I'm eating this grapefruit even though it's really not that sweet and part of me likes that and part of me would rather have Golden Grahams' grapefruit. You know what I mean.  M - very nice carbonation, medium-light body, coarse in the finish with some hop oil  O - one of my first favorite beers (nflmvp gave me a sixer for my 21st), unless they do something horrible to it it will remain a perennial favorite",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Chadillac,4.13,"2012 bottle poured into a tulip  Appearance: Pours a beautiful reddish color, slightly off white head. Just a good looking beer. Not many that look like this.  Smell: Having trouble getting a good nose on this. Definitely getting some sweet bready malts. Much more subtle on the hops this year. Not getting much hoppy notes in the aroma. Get a little sweet fruit when I give the glass a swirl.  Taste: Taste just like it smells, I was dissapointed with the taste. The piney taste is gone this year, sweet malty taste at the front of the toungue and leaves you with that classic IPA bitter aftertaste. Delicious but not the same.  Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation. Medium bodied. Great mouthfeel.  Overall: Great beer but unfortunetely different this year. They either used less hops or substituted some. Either way still an american classic and a great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T - A bold wintertime classic. IPA hops and bitterness combined with the robust malt and subtle spices that you'd expect from a winter seasonal beer. Bitter, but well balanced and complex enough to keep you sipping slow by the fireplcae.  M - somewhat abrasive carbonation, this is a beer you don't want to drink ice cold. Give it a little time.  Overall a great wintertime beer for celebrations, or just any night of the week. A standout beer for the style, big and bold flavor but without trying too hard. Definitely a sessionable beer for those cold winter evenings.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TheHappyGentleman,4.67,"Setting: On tap at VJ Bar in Chicago.  Glass: Imperial pint glass.  Appearance: Gorgeous burnt orange/copper with pillowy white head. 1.5-2 fingers of head that dissipates to less than 0.5 fingers after a couple of minutes and leaves a nice lacing around the glass.  Smell: Floral nose with notes of citrus (lemon), grass, and rye. Nose is firm but not overpowering.  Taste: Immediately smacks you in the face with malt followed by caramel notes. Hops and grapefruit are substantial - but not overwhelming to the palate. Toasty/Biscuity finish.  Mouthfeel: Very soft and creamy. One of the best aspects of this beer.  Overall: One of my favorite beers - just in time for the season with 6.8% of holiday cheer! Beautiful appearance with wonderful lacing around the pint glass from start to finish.

140,1904,NoLeafClover44,4.2,"Hard to believe I haven't reviewed this yet. 12 oz. bottle poured into standard pint glass. Bottled on October 5th. That means it took over a month to hit the shelf in my area.  A - Pours a vibrant amber color with two fingers of porous white head. The carbonation dies to a denser half finger, leaving behind a sticky tie-dye lacing. Great retention.  S - Sweet citrus and fragrant floral hops. A buttery biscuit and caramel malt backbone gives this one a nice warm aroma. Spicy, almost rye-like character as well.  T - The flavor is more mellow than I remember. A perfect balance of floral hops and sweet, bready malts. Some fruits, mostly citrus, dance in the background. Finishes with a nice hop zestiness. Aftertaste is mostly sweet.  M - The best way to describe the mouthfeel is soft. The frothy, creamy body is probably the highlight of this beer for me.  O - Like so many others, I look forward to this wintertime brew each year. It has remarkable balance with a complex caramel malt bill similar to a marzen (plus the hops, of course). The fresh floral hops are notable as well. This is a beer without many weaknesses. I typically go for the big citrus, hop forward IPAs but this one is delicious in an entirely different way.

140,1904,AmitC,4.33,"So finally, i have my hands on celebration ale from SN. This is the 2012 release.  Poured it into snifter. Small less than a finger thick head that persists quite well. Decent lacing. Slightly hazy amber color tilting towards red hues. Good number of bubbles.  Smell: Nose is full of hops and herbs with slight amount of malt presence. Fresh hops are felt upfront. Grassy feeling, but not very strong, just good enough, saying that it is fresh hopped. Complex and well balanced.  Taste: Well, does not feel bitter to me at all. Good balance between malts and hops. Slight hops upfront, but not at all powerful to suggest an IBU of 65. Slightly resinous and oily. Medium dry finish. Good hop after taste.  Mouth feel: Regular stuff. Medium bodied feel. Astringency from hops and carbonation, which is slightly more than it should have.  Overall a 4.25. Personally i am a bit underwhelmed after so much hype surrounding this. 4 for an IPA from me does not feel right. Try it once. Good drinkability though. Hop heads will be slightly disappointed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It's very hop forward w piney piney hops at first then sweet caramel and toasted bread before the citrusy hops come in to close the sweet deal w a nice citrusy bitter finish that lingers. This brew is easy to drink w a slick yet sticky lip smacking mouthfeel. I look forward to drinking this beer every year and it never disappoints.

Sticky webs of lacing cement themselves onto the glass.  S: Citrus notes of clementine and mandarin orange. Lemon rind and perhaps subtle hints of lime leaf. Soft aromas of pine needles and mint leaves. Pleasant grainy malt base. A touch brothy with scents of barley soup.  T: Citrus notes of clementine and lemon rind at the start. Grapefruit pith and rind as the bitterness builds. The hops shift again into tastes of tobacco and garden herbs as the bitterness reaches its apex. Slight cracked pepper. Fresh hop oils. Malt base of toasted grain. Slight broth. Finishes with a lingering minty, herbal, and citrus rind bitterness.  M: Medium bodied. Very smooth and creamy. Very soft, soothing sort of texture to it. Moderate carbonation.  O: An interesting choice Sierra Nevada has made, to have an IPA for a winter seasonal in lieu of some of the more traditional winter styles (porter, winter warmer, etc). But why not? It's a damn good beer and it sells very well. There's a great deal of complexity coming from the hop profile, and that fresh hop taste is what sets it apart.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,tectactoe,4.49,"Just finished my last Celebration of the season. Time to rewrite this review. Pours a deep copper-amber hybrid color with some orange highlights. An absolutely huge, beige-colored head tops this one off - incredibly thick and creamy with extraordinary staying power, also coating all sides of the glass with fat, chunky lacing. Decent clarity, and you can see a nice stream of carbonation bubbles flowing from the etched bottom of my glass to the top of the brew.  The aroma is strong, with a super-fresh dose of hops. Sierra Nevada claims that these are ""fresh"" hops (not wet, mind you, but fresh) and you can definitely tell. It's like sticking your head into a recently cut field of grass, vibrant and alive. The character of these hops is largely resinous, piney, and somewhat floral. The pine aromas hit your nostrils with some power, very needley and pungent. Faint citrus hints, more so on the rind and pith side, as to not make things too sweet, rather keep with the solid bitterness profile. Some spiciness from the hops is also noticeable and works to tie everything together.  The taste is crazy delicious - despite the heavy load of hops, there is certainly a strong malt presence here that does more than just lay out framework for the other parts. Slight toasted malts, caramel, toffee, and a faint, musky, earthy presence can be found immediately. As soon as you start to appreciate this nice, malt-laden infrastructure (or maybe even before that), the hops come in and go buck wild on your palate. Pines, pine needles, resinous hop nuggets, Christmas trees, Christmas wreathes - yeah, I said it. Christmas wreathes.  The malt profile is ever-present for the duration of the hop take-over, which creates a nice cosmic balance, despite the hefty bitter overload of the hops. The spice character is not to be forgotten - there's a joke going around that SN adds spices to this beer, which they've debunked as false many times. But I can see where people are coming from. A nice, peppery, earthy, and warming ""hop spice"" flavor trills along for the entire sip, riding a wave right into the aftertaste. I really can't overstate how goddamn tasty this shit is. Medium bodied, carbonated to the max; not too sticky, not too dry, this beer is great in all aspects.  Whether you call this a malty IPA, or a hopped-up amber/red ale, or a winter warmer, or whatever - it doesn't matter. Call it a stout for all I care. Just know that this beer is delicious. And the fact that it's a seasonal release around my favorite time of the year (the joyous bridge from Thanksgiving to Christmas) gets me that much more excited to pick it up each year. The holidays would not be complete without this beer in my fridge. I always try to make it last far into the spring - usually doesn't make it that long.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Soft bitterness is accompanied by a very floral hop flavor with a bit of fruitiness in the background. To balance I get a nice nice caramel sweetness and bready malts, though the bready malts come through stronger. There is also a slight spiciness that adds to the complexity.  M: Medium thickness with medium to high carbonation. Very good.  O: This beer is extremely well balanced and very tasty. There is a lot of hop aroma and flavor without being over the top.

Not getting the piney quality of SN's hop-forward beers. A little citrus, but also some malty sweetness, which could be subliminal.  T: Almost aggressively assertive. Initially juicy and citrusy, then an almost medicinal dryness on the back end.  M: Really, really dry. Bitterness is overwhelming.

This is a truly reddish looking ale, complete with an initial 2 finger head that never appears to fully recede. Carbonation gloriously climbs to the top, and lacing remains all around the glass as I drink it. This looks like a fresh batch of homebrew, made with lots of care and attention.  The aroma is filled with - as advertised - hop oil that contains warm citrus notes and a sweet, maple-like smell. There are scrumptious smelling toffee malts, and a crisp biscuit finish. The yeastiness is present, and while slightly fruity, it mellows out under the malts and hops. This is definitely a festival of different seasonal aromas, and while somewhat unbalanced, it's really fun and enjoyable.  The flavor consists of an initial citrus fruitiness that immediately is smoothened by the toffee and caramel notes present in the malts, and then finished with a fresh hop zest. This amazingly pleasant! It's very yeasty in the middle, but it's yet another testament to how fresh this batch is. Not watery in any respect, but definitely filled with seasonal flavors that create a complex drinking experience, despite the fact that it's unbelievably easy to drink. I cannot taste the alcohol on this one, and it's freshness and varied flavors would make this tempting to drink extremely fast.  This beer pretty much takes what Southern Hemisphere does and takes it to a whole new yet far simplified level. In a way, I prefer this, because as an avid hater of ""seasonal beer,"" SN made a beer here that could be enjoyed at any time of the year, but it wouldn't be nearly as fresh if they did release it year-round. Great stuff, and a really adequate way to chime in the holidays. Another triumph for SN!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Biffster,3.95,"The beer is beautiful - a deep crystal clear amber/copper with a very persistent rocky off white head and lace that clings to the side of the glass.  The aroma has a fairly intense grapefruit and piney, resiny start. It is countered by a strong dark bread and fruity malt aroma, with some moderate graham cracker and low caramel notes. There is more dark ripe fruit notes as it warms.  It's fruity and sweet at the sip, but not overly cloying. It gives way quickly to an intense hoppy bitterness and a strong but not intense or overwhelming tart citrus, melon, and big piney hope flavor. It is bitter and lingering at the swallow. The finish is strong, bitter and a bit alcoholic, but not harsh or hot.  The mouthfeeel is moderate - an almost spritzy carbonation, but a fluffy, almost creamy body. There is no astringency or hotness, but there is some touch of alcohol warmth.  God I love this beer. I look forward to it every year. It actually isn't the most amazing IPA, but I've grown to look forward to it every year. I can't imagine decorating a tree or stringing lights without a Celebration. It's just part of the season...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - Hops very prevalent, also smells slightly of booze. Get a light whiff of malts as well.  T - Very notable hops up front. A little bit of spice and malt in the middle and some slight booziness towards the end. The taste is much bolder than the smell, but that's a good thing.  M - About typical for any good IPA.  Overall - An incredibly well-balanced offering from Sierra Nevada. Not a whole lot of room for improvement.

140,1904,Mojo,4.22,"This is some awfully good stuff. It pours a hazy copper with about a one finger white head and delicate spider web like lacing. The nose is floral, resin, biscuit, and spices. Taste is a sweet citrus with a little spice and hops on the finish, basically following the nose. Mouthfeel is very nice with a mild bitter citrus aftertaste. It is easy to see how this is so well regarded.

140,1904,denver10,3,"So, tried this once last year and was a little underwhelmed. Coming back for seconds with this, only this time its a fresh one. See how round 2 goes.  Pours a nice firey bronze with a thick off white head. Great lacing. A great hoppy married to sweet aroma; floral and lemon hops on top a doughy malt base.Flavor is much the same with the lemony and floral hops shining on top a thick somewhat doughy malt base that offers hints of toffee hiding out there. A sharp, piney finish to this. A nice creamy, active mouthfeel. Overall, a nice beer. Kinda reminds me of Odells Town Pump Pale in that both seem like they could just as easily be labeled a dry hopped amber as easily as an (A/I)PA, though this one is certainly far more hoppier and complex than Town Pump.

T - Hop flavors of light citrus and pine, with floral and earthy notes. Balanced well by the sweet caramel malt backbone.  M - Excellent body on this beer, medium and plenty of carbonation.

Great hoppy brew from SN. I've also had it aged a year and it retains much of the hop flavor surprisingly, but a much more 'dirty', earthy hop flavor is present. Superb either way.

The body is light-medium with fine carbonation adding to the drinkability. Mouth feel is smooth and a little creamy, though somewhat sticky at times and has a light bitter finish.

140,1904,TheRealBigC,4.28,"I tried Celebration Ale in my first 6 months of drinking beer and could not put it down. I had labeled it the worst beer I've ever had. Not long after I had a similar experience with Lagunitas' IPA. But, after some time developing a taste for big hops and such, I've revisited a lot of these beers with different results. The Lagunitas IPA still does nothing for me, but I rather like Celebration Ale. It's reddish body and sticky head looks nice. Mild hop aromas and flavor with a surprising woodiness to it (an appropriate label for sure). It's an easy drinker that doesn't give up any flavor in doing so. Hops can be pungent, but it feels more like they are there to force into savoring smaller sips rather than gulp it down.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,macrosmatic,3.81,"Reviewed from notes. 2013 vintage. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a Russian River pint glass.  A: Pours a dark gold to amber, a bit hazy, with lots of visible carbonation and a finger's worth of eggshell fluffy head, with moderately poor retention.  S: Big resinous pine hops and a bready malt – nice, though not complex - with hints of the bitterest grapefruit rind and toffee.  T: Follows the nose, but with more citrus (lemon and grapefruit) and a touch of grassy hops. The toasted bready malt tries to show up before the swallow, but is smashed back down by the hops. A touch of tropical fruit hops and a hefty bitterness with a touch of booze shows up near the end. The bitterness is moderate, though it lingers somewhat.  M: Mouthfeel on the heavy side for style. Good carbonation sensation, and the alcohol is noticeable, though it's not hot as such.  O: This is good, but I'm somewhat perplexed about the ""fresh hop"" statement on the label. There was a time that it didn't say this - I don't know if there was a change in recipe, or simply a change in labeling. But there's nothing in the flavor nor aroma that would have made me think it was made with fresh hops.

140,1904,Doughbodyboy,3.93,this beer really surprised me. its' looks were slightly decieving. i wasn't expecting such a drinkable IPA. it has a golden amber hue with a fair amount of foggyness. the smell is unmistakably that of an IPA. it has that tartness to it that becons a sip. upon putting it to my lips the foam had a creamy taste that flooded in with some citrus and tangy tastes that quickly fleeted into a lasting hop bitterness. once in my mouth the carbonation was bouncing on my tounge enthusiastically. this one of my new favorite american IPAs. it's a shame it's only around for the holidays. cheers!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Rhynes2,4.47,"This beer is overstocked at my local shop and so I was able to buy an entire case of this stuff for $18.50. Pretty happy about that. Anyway, I poured this one into a pint glass and started reviewing. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a nice 1/4 inch white head. Hops are the focus of this beer and it has a nice citrus flavor. I can taste sweet orange peel flavors and balanced with a nice hop spiciness. Malts are in the background but still there and slightly sweet. It's a great IPA and I'll be buying this brew again for sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,drewone,4.08,"2011 on label, pour into snifter  Deep orange color, hazy, lots of small floaties. Nice thick head, thin layer remains for a while, foam lacing sticks to glass.  Hoppy piney, but not hit you over the head. Woodsy and some sweetness too.  Malt sweetness and hops spiciness work well together, perhaps a bit sweet. Satisfying bitter finish/aftertaste.  Creamy mouth feel, smooth but with ends with a tang. Nice amount of carbonation.  Solid, holds up well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,wowbagger,2.69,"Very little aroma. Taste is mostly of hop and malt, I don't detect very much else. It's full bodied, decent for an IPA, but I can't say that I'm a great fan of the style and this one isn't enough to turn me. I've enjoyed one or two but I probably wouldn't request it again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Dave1999,4.13,"This pours a nice orangey brown colour with a big bubbly head which dissipates pretty quickly.  This has a big smell with lots of hops and malts. There are pine needles and citrus notes.  This beer is very hoppy, with a nice malt back bone coming through as the beer warms.  Feels very smooth in the mouth with medium to high carbonation.  This a very good beer, the hops are delicious and very bitter. Probably my favourite Sierra Nevada beer so far.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PatDreadful,4.33,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle to a Nonic Pint.  Appearance: Pours a very vibrant translucent amber with burnt edges. A wonderful slight off-white head rises up about 2 inches and clings to the glass beautifully all the way down.  Smell: As with most Sierra Nevada brews I am overwhelmed by the citrus aroma. The grapefruit seems to play a very prevalent role in this brew as slight notes of spice and pine reveal themselves. The smell is unique in that it doesn't exactly smell of any particular Christmas scent but consistently reminds of the holiday (if that makes any sense).  Taste: I have never spent Christmas in California but this is how I imagine it to be. The citrusy hops move to the forefront which eventually gives way to the bittering hops which are big, bold and bitter. After several sips I realize that there is an overall spruce-like sweetness that is barely noticeable but keeps all of the flavors together.  Feel: I love the warming sensation of this medium bodied ale. The alcohol and carbonation work well with the hops to give the tongue a pretty good workout.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. I could easily work through a 6 pack on Christmas Eve while sitting around the fire.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Grohnke,4.22,"Classic, bright and clean wet hop nose. You're greeted with a bouquet of big citrus (grapefruit, tangerines and oranges) and subtle sweetness underneath. As it comes to temperature, other hop personalities are introduced (earthy, spicy).  A loosely knit, creamy, yellowish/buttermilk head. Just from swirling the glass, it has started its trail of lacing on the glass. It falls into the beer slowly, almost under protest. Deep amber color with some browns, reds, and golds...makes for a really good looking beer. Slightly cloudy, and given the loud nose on this one, Ill say confidently that its due to dry-hopping.  Really big hop flavor and a healthy amount of bitterness. Pine, Citrus, Earth, and Spice all come out with the first sip. Toasted malt adds a sharp sweetness to the beer. Alcohol was undetectable until this point (its down in temperature by now), and its warming, not offensive.  Medium-bodied, and appropriate to high level of carbonation. Strong, dry hop finish (the spiciness is highlighted here), which lingers for quite some time. ""Crisp"" comes to mind.  Very bright, exciting flavors and aromas from this one. Big hop flavor and nose, and the malty sweetness was well played. I enjoyed how each hop characteristic almost had their own introduction and time in the spotlight, but by the middle of the beer, they all came together in harmony.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A - One inch off-white fluffy, billowy head; Slightly hazy appearance; Nice, bright copper color; Nice lacing left all around the glass; Tiny sediment floating within the beer  S - Awesome hoppy smell; Smell is a combination of citrus, pine, and tropical fruits; Some smells highlight a good bit of pine, while others show more tropical fruits  T - Quite a bit of bitterness in this beer from start to finish, though it does lighten up a bit in the end; Lots of piney hops in the taste with some tropical fruits that break through the bitterness at the end of the taste; As the beer warms, toasty flavors begin to step forward  M - Moderate carbonation; Medium bodied; Dry finish that leaves an oily, bitter coat on the tongue  O - I really enjoyed trying this brew again, and forgot how good it really is. The bitterness is strong in this beer, but I find that to be a great quality and even a bit warming. I didn't even have this very fresh, and the flavor was still very puckering and addictive.

140,1904,markmiller,4.12,"2011 Bottle, poured into a pint  A: Pours a wonderful orange honey with thick off white head. Leaves lacing. Vigorous pour produced a 3 finger head that turned into what looked like a biscuit floating on top. Wonderful.  S: Citrus hops right off the top with some malt background. Smells sweeter as well.  T: The taste is less sweet than the nose. Still the citrus hops are right at the front and the slightest malt evens the beer out. Finishes coating your tongue with kind of piney resin.  M: Good carbonation, coating on the finish.  D: Yeah, this has got a good taste and goes down easy and makes you want to drink more.  O: I can definitely look forward to picking this up around the holidays. It's a nice change from the winter warmers or spiced beers. Hoppy and fresh.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TheSixthRing,4.23,"Appearance - Pours a nice, deep golden orange. A thick, off-white 2 finger head develops with good retention. Lacing is thin, but shows great stick.  Smell - Sweet malt, and a fresh hop undertone.  Taste - Just like it smells. Begins with sweet malts upfront, subtle candied sugar sweetness, lightly toasted biscuit, then gives way to a beautifully bitter citrus hop that stays within a consistent range through to the finish. Orange pith lingers well into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied, bubbly carbonation.  Overall - One of Sierra's better offerings. The bitterness can get a bit overwhelming at times, due to it's long linger time. Taking a few minutes to reset brings you back to the beauty in this beer. Despite this minor nitpick, this is a very good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,hopfacebrew,3.46,"Note: This review was a re-post from my former account, jmkratt, which was hacked and I lost all my reviews...sorry for the redundancy.  On tap at Uptown Brewing Co. in Denver on 1/28/2010. Poured into an Uptown pint glass.  A - Deep amber/cooper color with a nice 2 finger head with decent retention and lacing throughout the glass.  S - I was not impressed with the aroma of the beer, or lack thereof. Very mild citrus hop aroma but really not much at all.  T/M - The beer actually starts with sweeter tones of roasted malts before transitioning to a earthy/piney/citrus palette which blends fairly well with the malts. The beer finishes with a slight astringent bitterness. Medium bodied with good carbonation.  D - Drinkable beer but I'd prefer a Torpedo.

It says winter beer on the bottle but I would agree that it's more of an IPA than anything else.  Good golden/amber color.

Taste: The hops hit you first as one might expect from Sierra. There are bitter citrus tones followed by some pine and grass. At the end you get some very mild malt.

Nice, sweet biscuitty malt prevents the beer from going over the top.  Mouthfeel: Very chewy for an IPA. Deeply satisfying to sip and perfect for the style.  Overall: I really have to hand it to Sierra Nevada. They're not the hippest or most experimental brewery out there, but this beer is a testament to their skill. It tastes like a classic beer, something you'd sip on in Milwaukee on a blustery winter night, watching football at a bar, alone, but happy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Chickenhawk9932,4.2,Pours a nice copper/rust color with a healthy tan head that hangs around.  Pine dominates the nose with citrus and malt in the background.

140,1904,DabblinWiscCraft,4.15,"I was excited to find this at my local market in a build your own six pack display. It pours a very nice rosy-tinged amber, just slightly cloudy and with a great deal of visible carbonation. A half inch eggshell head fell to about an eighth of an inch that hung around with quality lacing. The nose is very pleasant with a hop-forward profile that's very grassy/herbal. The initial taste of this beer is something special, with a very well-balanced flavor of malt and herbal hops. I thought that this one was going to end on a clean note, but it has a slightly piney hop bitterness that sticks on the tongue for a bit. It's not an unpleasant bitterness at all, but it's a little more pronounced than I would have liked. The mouthfeel is creamy and nice throughout the foretaste, but--again--that acidic bitterness at the end is a bit of a detraction to me.  Now that I'm nearing the end of the glass here, I'm actually enjoying this beer more than in that initial taste. I'm a huge fan of American IPAs, and this one can certainly hold its own. As with other Sierra Nevada offerings I've enjoyed, I can taste the quality of the ingredients--especially the hops. Though I wish it finished a bit cleaner, the bitterness at the back does provide some added complexity. Well worth a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,STKPICR0720,4.62,Just an amazing brew. I really have not had wet hops before and most definitely did not expect this beer to smell as great as it did.

Its abv is over 100 in my mind and though the hops are good, when they are this strong its just too bitter. The closest thing I can compare it to is biting into the side of an aspen tree, you'd like it but you wouldn't want to do it again from your mouth puckering and your teeth hurting.  Hinterlands ipa is similar, but this is still pushing the envelope even farther.

140,1904,output01x,3.98,"Poured from a 12 oz. capped bottle (no date) into a pint glass.  A strong pour yields a 2-finger head that nearly spills over the edges of the glass. The head is creamy off white in color that slowly fades after a few minutes to a thick, clumpy coating and thick foam ring. The body is a translucent copper amber with a decent amount of rising carbonation bubbles. Thick, messy lacing clings randomly to the glass throughout consumption.  The nose is very aromatic and can be appreciated by people on the other side of the room during the pour. Notes of orange and lemon peel, pine, and just a bit of bready malt give the nose an oily, resinous character.  Oily orange peel starts each sip along with biscuit and bitter pine. As the beer is swallowed, the flavors meld together as the pine bitterness becomes a bit stronger and gains an almost grassy characteristic. The bitterness remains after each sip as an aftertaste that clings both to the entirety of the tongue and most corners of the mouth.  Medium bodied with great carbonation, this beer lies somewhere between sipper and gulper. The body is full enough to allow all the flavors to truly come out. It is also slightly sticky and a bit coating but never in a bad way. The carbonation is somewhat fizzy but does not detract from the flavors nor the experience.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,aBeeraWeek,4.25,"You just need to take a quick whiff to instantly recognise that this is not your usual spiced winter’s seasonal ale. You will be hit with a refreshing burst of melon passionfruit and citrus, which can be most closely related to grapefruit.  The taste is equally powerful – bold and bitter from the outset. The citrus still continues but takes on more of a lemon taste. The aftertaste is less bold and you are left with a more floral hop bitterness that is nicely balanced with sweet caramels and honeys – now we are getting closer to a traditional winter offering.  The feel in the mouth is medium to full bodied and carbonation is light enough not to distract from the wonderful flavours.  Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale pours with a solid, thick, and bubbly off-white head. The beer is a dark rich amber and is filled with fine bubbles (about the same size as Champagne). The lacing on the glass is fantastic – it is fine and crystal like and has the appearance of falling like snow. How fitting for a holiday season offering.  As this beer has plenty of body and hoppy bitterness you need to be careful with the food to match with. You need something with enough punch to carry the flavour, but at the same time not be a filling main course. I would suggest an entree sized wild game selection. Venison is particularly well suited to the Celebration Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Unlike most west coast IPAs, this one has a good dose of malts backing it up, holding a sweet hoppy finish, dry and bitter. Fresh prickly pine in there as well. A bit one dimensional but such a damn solid brew that's always welcomed this time of year.  I'd give even better scores with this one due to consistency and affordability but there are too many other IPAs available to me that I've enjoyed a bit more such as Aroma Coma, Blind Pig, Hopfather, Just Outstanding, Union Jack and Sculpin.

T: Large hop profile upfront that are tamed only slightly by the malts, but overall quite bitter.  M: Medium/light, fairly high carbonation that is followed by a slight burn.

140,1904,weizenbob,4.25,"As Celebration is somehow the only beer in the Sierra Nevada lineup not available in my hometown, this 12 ounce bottle was purchased at Sweeney’s in Williamsburg, MI ($9.99/6-pack). It is bottle dated October 4, 2011. It was poured into a Duvel tulip glass. A standard pour (horizontal bottle, 45 degree glass) yields two fingers of foamy ivory head. As with Sierra Nevada’s year-round IPA, Torpedo, the head retention is fantastic. It settles around a finger tall and refuses to go away. Sticky lacing clings to the glass replacing the slowly receding head. The beer is amber in color. It is only mildly translucent. The hue is darker than most, but the head makes this a beauty of a glass of beer.  A lovely aroma wafts effortlessly from the glass. Hops burst forth with citrus and mild pine. It is Sierra Nevada we’re talking about so there is no doubt that this has been generously dry hopped. The aroma is also somewhat sweet, though not malty, with remnants of lemon rind and honey.  The flavor leans in favor of hops over malt, but the balance is well within the parameters of good taste. Grapefruit bitterness bites assertively though not overwhelmingly. Sweet tangerine carries the middle. The finish is laced in more hops as resinous pine flavors coat the mouth and tongue. Their impression is felt long after the sip has been swallowed. Malts are present enough to stand up to the onslaught of hops while adding little distinction of their own in the flavor, save for some honey-like sweetness that peeks through. This is a hop lover’s delight.  With its generous hop bite, this is not the easiest drinking beer on the block; but as an IPA it is quite drinkable for its potency. The mouthfeel is creamy, making this beer feel heavier than its medium body would imply. Carbonation is low but adds a little sting to the hoppy punch. The feel does nothing to detract from this beer’s general excellence.  Celebration has a lot going for it. It is from Sierra Nevada so it has some of the best distribution around. It is from Sierra Nevada so it is reasonably priced. It looks and smells great and tastes and feels good. I will not say that this is the best IPA I’ve poured, but I can say without a doubt that it is the best value of any IPA that I have purchased. That is certainly something.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (reference my profile for an explanation) I give two Schlitz about Celebration. Beer for beer, Sierra Nevada may be the finest brewery in the country (or maybe that crown still goes to Founders).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,perrymarcus,4,"12oz bottle served in a pint glass. 2011 batch.  pours a reddish / medium amber tone while yielding a 1 and 1/2"" off-white head. decent retention and lacing.  relatively fragrant nose offers big citric and pine notes, a touch floral, and just the hint of sweet malt.  flavor follows the aroma with a big citric/piney presence in front, followed by caramel malt and some spice characters. finishes with a solid hoppy kick. medium bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation.  overall, a damn good beer but not one i go gaga over like so many others. which is fine, taste being subjective and all that.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,midworken,4.15,"Pours a cinnamon-caramelly color with a light tan head. The flavors that come to the nose are spices followed by the sweet caramelization of the malt.  Spices upfront on the taste - very bold flavors that speak volumes on the tongue. What is so great about this brew is what comes after the first taste. The spices fade letting you experience the malty depth underneath... but then a second set of hops and spices come long after the initial sip is gone. Such complexity that can be only crafted by a master brewer. Although the second set of spices is different than the first, their combination at the second sip is superb. From this single beer you can enjoy 4 different flavors - the taste at the very beginning of your first sip, then comes the malty backbone, then the final round of spices, but you can take another sip while you still have that final round of spices and you get an even greater experience with this beer. It's hard not rating this part a ""5"". It's a dry beer with a decent amount of bitterness, but the flavors last quite some time. You can enjoy this beer when it's cold or when it's warmed up to room temp which makes it a great beer to share with some non-craft drinking friends.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,gkunkle,4.35,"Pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with an off white head over an inch tall thanks to an aggressive pour. Carbonation is visible. Head recedes to about 1/4 of an inch and leaves die nice rings of lacing in my glass. Smell is primarily of sweet citrus, more of an orange smell than the usual grapefruit, with a secondary scent of pine coming in also. The taste hi lights both of these flavors as well as the hops. In the taste I get the malt first followed by the pine then the citrus, the aftertaste contains both the pine and citrus, but is dominated by the pine taste. Mouthfeel is average for an IPA, carbonation is assertive. Overall, great beer. I can say though that there are better fresh hop IPAs. This is one of the reasons I love Sierra Nevada. This beer is worth buying a 12 pack.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,liamt07,4.23,"Bottle from AJ's Fine Foods in on North Central in Phoenix. 2011 vintage, 12oz bottle into a chalice.  Poured a hazy, rust red/brown with a few fingers of offwhite head with some good density to it. Excellent 'whipped cream'-like retention, and laces sheets. Nose has a great wet hop character, raw and resinous citrus of orange and grapefruit character, some tropical notes and a general herbal/grassiness that I always seem to find in fresh hopped ales. Some sweet caramel breads behind the hops. Taste is bitter right off the bat, with some substantial citrus rind, pine, berries and floral/herbal hop notes again. Sweet caramell-y bready malts again that are secondary to the juicy and chewy hops. Medium full mouthfeel with a solid bitterness that hangs around long into the finish in a grassy fashion. A touch of alcohol and sweetness, with medium carbonation. Great flavours and complexity, I'm certainly curious as to how this ages.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,pweis909,4,"Lovely red color with a bit of haze that disappears as the beer warms.  Surprisinly subdued citrusy hop aroma that I'll attibute to cooler than appropriate serving temperature.  Malt is not particularly complex, although there is a caramel sweetness that becomes more apparent as the beer warms. I feel like I can put a name on the citrusy hop character - slight tangerine, which may be enhanced in my perception by a little sour twang to the beer. The bitterness delivered by the hops is strong, but not bracingly slow. To me, it seems less bitter than Torpedo.  This beer is supposed to be world class, and I felt there were some promising aspects to my sampling of it. Perhaps I will try it again, heeding serving temp more carefully.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: This one smells like forest, very herbal and with lot of hops, some barley and some yeast is also in the air.  T: The flavors on this one are base of malts and then it's flavor make think as if this one was made only of hops.  M: Crispy sensation, it is a medium body what can be felt on the mouth, at some point it is a little astringent due to the bitterness, the end is fair of course it keeps the bitterness on your mouth.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,DreamInOrange,4,"Poured a nice orange amber color with good carbonation and a small, quickly dissipating head. Aroma is definitely piney with some spice scents.

It was pretty good, but not as good as I was hyped up to believe.  It was pretty dark for an IPA and kind of one dimensional. I was expecting more than just one hop character. Overall, not too bad, definitely a nice and bitter thick IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Cozzatoad,4.18,"Nice find at a local beer bar. It's quite unusual to find tapped beer from the US and this was also super fresh  A- Deep dark orange colour, quite hazy. Almost 3 fingers of amazingly frothy white head that shows decent retention. Loads of super-dense lacing on the sides of the glass  S- Background grainy malt base, with a slight toasted hint to it. Then piny, herbal and menthol notes from the hops. A slight hint of spiciness, probably from the esters  T- Toasted grainy malt backbone as the smell suggested. A bold resinous, piny bittering bite hits the palate, but it never gets too aggressive or bitter thanks to a very nice range of undernotes from the hops: some kind of floral feel, mint, tobacco, as well as some spicy grapefruit and lemon notes on the tongue. Nicely persistent resinous, bitter aftertaste  M- Medium bodied. Extremely smooth on the palate with just the right hint of delicate but very thick carbonation. More on the juicy and fresh side on the tongue, where the fruity flavours spread  O- Perhaps the most complex IPA i have tried (not that i have tried hundreds). I was asking myself how an american IPA could be meant for the winter but now i see, this is absolutely perfect for the winter. Still extremely drinkable despite its intense bitterness.

Love the bite of the carbonation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,NiceTaps,4.35,"Great amber ale color. Nice two-finger head that stays throughout. Looks and tastes very good. The pine/ mild citris aroma is pleasant but not overpowering, just right.

140,1904,BBP,4.31,"Pours a typical hop orange hue with a good head, nice retention, and pretty good lacing.  The aroma is of floral hops. Not really blasting aroma, but it's a little past optimal freshness so some aroma could have faded.  The taste is superb. I really think this has to be one of, if not the best deal on IPAs out there. It's full of hop bitterness, flavor, and leaves a really nice pine and citrus. The aftertaste and followthrough is the icing on the cake. The flavor lasts for quite a while.  The mouthfeel is medium heavy, and medium thick. Carbonation is lively, but not aggressive. The finish is dry and slightly sticky.  Overall, this really caught me off guard. I wasn't expecting a tone, as I figured it was past it's prime, but I think if I had it fresh, it could easily be one of my top five favorite IPAs. I can say without a doubt, this is a beer I would buy by the case if it was readily available to me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smells like a truck of fresh hops and cherry cough syrup cooked up in an oak kettle just rolled in. Cherry cough syrup might sound nasty, but it's just the closest approximation I can put forth . . . cherry sucrets maybe? You know I wouldn't be drinking cherry cough syrup for fun! Tastes like a bastard of a strong ale with cherry, bitter, tart, fresh, wood, sweet tangy, mmm. So well done. Kudos, Sierra Nevada!!  I can't call this an IPA.

Intense hop aroma, citrus with perhaps earthy/pine behind it. Bread-like malt tones underneath.  Crisp up front, with a mild snap on the tongue from the hops. Fresh pine flavor takes over, lighting up the palate as it rolls over the tongue. Dry, clean finish.  Hop-forward yet well balanced. Easy drinking but full of flavor.

Two fingers of white foam that billow above the top of the glass and sticks around for a good period of time. Some of the best head retention I have seen. From the hops I'm picking up some floral notes along with some nice resinous and citrusy aromas. It tastes like grapefruits, very citrusy which is backed up nicely by the malts, which are present. It's medium bodied with a nice crispness from the carbonation. The hops are balanced nicely with the malt bill but are still big and flavorful and bitter. This is one fantastic IPA.

There's a decent amount of yeastiness in the nose and taste.  Taste has generous and prominent bittering hops. Apart from that it's a pleasant melding of hop, malt and yeast.  Mouthfeel is really nice on this beer, brings a nice thick creaminess.  Prefer this one to Torpedo.

140,1904,thecheapies,4.13,"12oz bottle. Felt like pouring it into a snifter. Why not?  Hazy sienna orange with a bit of fluff. Latching onto the glass in cirrus cloud whisks. Elegantly displayed.  Heap of grapefruit/tangerine hop aroma wafting from the mouth of the glass. Strong toasty malt presence amplified by a charming sweetness.  Nice malt/hops interplay for a sub 7% beer. Lots of juicy citrus. A little lemon in the limelight. Toasted bread, juniper berry, hints of caramel and light sandalwood dustiness. Bittering and benevolent. Some of the hop character is floral and leafy with mouth-watering tang. Less fruity in the finish. Well executed and full-flavored.  Fuller richness to the mouthfeel than one might expect. Luscious character and fittingly sudsy carbonation. Feels superb.  A go-to every year. One of the best winter IPAs on the market.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MrKennedy,4.03,"12oz bottle, thanks to mulder1010 for the six pack! Poured into a small tumbler.  Has a light copper appearance with good clarity for the colour. Has a nice light beige, creamy looking head of foam that measured in at a couple of fingers and laced sporadically as it receded.  Strong citrus, fruity smell initially along with pine that changes to grapefruit that stays with it until the end.  Taste is a mix of grapefruit and caramel, the former is by far the most dominant.  Bitterness is a little unusual in that there is plenty early and it is less bitter later on. Creamy feel is interspersed and perhaps detracts from the bitterness at the end. Still quite drinkable.  Very good all round IPA with plenty of grapefruit in the smell and taste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,oline73,4.15,Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a clear reddish amber with a finger of off white head that fades to a ring around the edge of the glass.  Smell: Sweet malt up front with some citrus hops coming into the fold as you take a whiff. A little bit bready with some citrus fruit notes in there as well.  Taste: The malt and hop balance in this beer is really nice. Just enough bready malt to back up the fresh citrus peel hop flavor. I'm getting more orange peel than grapefruit in this one. The hop bitterness stays with you through the finish.  Mouthfeel: This one is just on the thick side for the style if you ask me. Aggressive carbonation with a slightly dry finish.  Overall: I look forward to cracking one of these open every holiday season. Great balance and hop profile. I'll definitely have more in the future.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,nitro0292,4.38,"Pour produces ample sticky, just off white head. Color is a true amber with a very slight touch of haze. Head retains for ever and leaves gobs of lacing all the way down the glass.  Aroma is of hops, and not much else. Tons of resinous pine notes and grapefruit rind. Very inviting.  Taste is classic West Coast IPA, strong bitter hops with pine and resin flavors dominating the hop profile. Sufficient malt sweetness to prevent this from being hop juice, but there is certainly copious among of hops on the tongue. Not quite puckering, but close. Malt breadiness makes an appearance in the aftertaste and on the front of tongue. Finish is dry with strong lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel is a heavy-ish medium, with sufficient carbonation. Feels like a stronger beer than it is, and that sensation adds to the enjoyment. I do not find that the mouthfeel typical adds to a beer, it usually just detracts if it doesn't match the other characteristics. Here, however, that is not the case. The almost DIPA like mouthfeel helps Celebration keep its balance.  Overall, this is an outstanding brew. Making it a seasonal makes it that much more enjoyable. This is very well executed and is a must try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dawatts,4.38,"A - Lovely off white half inch head already with a bit of lacing from it settling. A light amber color with a bit of haze to it.  S - What a terrific aroma or pine, cayenne, lemon, and cinnamon. Very inviting.  T - Taste is of grapefruit and evergreen with notes of butterscotch and orange towards the finish. Definitely a spicier IPA but that is what is so amazing about this where it still has the hoppy characteristics and the spice just seems to live in there happily with it.  M - Perfect carbonation with orange on the back of the tongue and into the throat. Creamy but dry.  O - A really nice holiday ale from Sierra Nevada. I bought a six pack and then went out the next day to get a case to make sure I had more on hand. Ive enjoyed it with pizza and Ive had it with steaks and it just seems to work with any food. I may pick up another case.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - Not sure if it's just my nose tonight, or the fact that I'm using a pint glass, but I'm having real issues getting a good wiff. Some notes of Cascade and Centennial still coming through though.

140,1904,BeerNoobNC,4.85,"This is my first review of this beer, but I have had several of them this winter season. They are too good.  Pours a hazy amber color that is not really transparent. The hops only have a slight citrus flavor to them, but they are well-balanced in the beer. The bottle says that this is a fresh hop beer. I get that taste from it, though I have no idea what that means. This is easily one of the best IPAs I have ever had, and it does not just fall into the obscurity of ""pretty good"" IPAs that I have had but could easily forget about it. After this beer goes off the shelves, it will be in the back of mind until next season when it is available again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Nugganooch,3.91,"‘Tis the season. What a fantastic case purchase.  *Notes from 12-18-11 12oz to pint glass  A: Celebration Ale pours a darker golden amber color. Close to caramel in color with a slight fuzzy haze to it. Adorned with a two finger khaki creamed head that leaves just sheets of cascading lace down the glass.  S: Smell is pungent with pines. Backed with notes of citrus, bready pale malts, and a fruity ale yeast character.  T: Taste is packed full of pine and quite pungent as well with a spicy graham cracker malt base to it. Nice balanced bitterness overall but resinous from intense dry hopping. Brings a very fresh and sharp herbalicous component rounding out this very nice and robust IPA.  M: Medium body ale with nice carbonation giving a rather creamy texture and touch of drying crisp to the finish. Sticky sweet hop residues coat the mouth.  D: A west coast winter ale! A slightly more robust IPA with definite bready malt presence. Intensely piney and spicy yet balanced and smooth. Very welcomed in my household this time of year or anytime as a matter of fact.  A true celebration of the hops!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Tiny bubbles float to the top, and the head is soft, pillowy, and pristine white.  S: Sharp and astringent. Floral and fruity. Vegetal. Lots of citrust in the nose with a biscuity, matly backbone.  T: Fresh hops, though different on tap and bottled. Its like rubbing hops in your face and inhaling deeply. Bitter and sharp, but very harmonious. There is a lingering sweetness on the tongue that serves to curb the after taste of all those hops.  M: Bubbly, but thick, viscous, and smooth. This is a great IPA.  O: Love it. This is my favorite Sierra Nevada brew yet.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Duhast500,4.44,Poured from the tap into a pint glass.  The color is an orange/red with a finger or two of foamy off-white head and some nice lacing left on the glass.  The smell is pretty piney like a Christmas tree and has some nice earthy tones to the aroma as well. There is some big hops here and it’s not hiding it.  The taste is bitter with some interesting pine flavor mixed with some citrus fruits. The hops are here and make things Christmas-like with the piney hop flavor. There is some sweet malt flavor but they play in the background as the hops steal the spotlight.  The feel of this beer is medium body but a little bitter at first. Something to get used to this beer does mellow out and then has a smooth feel that slides around easier then expected.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,LittleCreature,3.87,"Appearance - 5.0 Pours three fingers of dense cream coloured over a deep amber to reddish orange body with some fine suspended sediment.  Smell - 3.0 Not unpleasant by any stretch, but severely lacking in aroma for an IPA. Some lightly perfumy hop aroma, but it is very indistict, vaguely grassy and herbal.  Taste - 4.0 Biscuity malt backbone supports the hops and bitterness, but does not intrude. Hop bitterness is spot on (assertive, but not aggressive) although flavour is mostly grassy with a subtle orange note.  Mouthfeel - 4.5 Fine bead and lively carbonation work together to create a lush, velvety, slightly oily, almost creamy mouthfeel.  Overall - 4.0 Having had this beer twice, I can be fairly certain that this bottle was not as fresh as it should have been. Still an enjoyable IPA, but lacking the big, grassy, herbal wet hop aroma of a fresh Celebration. Will re-review later with a hopefully fresher bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

This was an excellent beer that I was very pleased to be drinking instead of studying, and maybe that inflated my ratings, but I thought it was very good.  Has a kick on the back of the palate, and comes off very hoppy, but I like that so this was a great, relaxing beer. Without the label I would have called it a Northwest IPA due to the strong taste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Rantingfury,4.82,"I poured this wonderful beer from the bottle in a conical shaped glass. It has a nice creme colored head about two fingers thick that slowly fades back. The lacing is nice and really sticks to the glass. The color of the beer itself is a nice amber that borderlines on almost copper.The aroma is heavenly to a hop head and well balanced. The hops' citrus, pine, and spice notes tickled the nose then faded to the caramel of the malt. The aroma balance is spot on. The flavor starts off tart from the spices and hops and goes to the sweetness of the malt. The after taste is a bit on the pine side. The mouth feel is medium, it clings to the palate much like the lacing of the head does to the glass.  Over all this a very drinkable winter beer. It successfully blends an IPA with a spiced malt beer. I look forward to next year's batch.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,elNopalero,4.45,"2012 edition review:  This looks good—a malty warm amber color with white bright foam. It has a pleasing aroma with some light malt & a piney resin aroma. The flavor has a great upfront bitterness with a pleasing resiny hop kick, some sweetness and a welcomed bitter finish. Always dependable and doesn’t disappoint this year either.  2011 review:  I get some holiday spices, lots of nutmeg and cinnamon, and a warming aroma of clove and fruitcake. Age this for several years and see how it develops. Oh wait, I actually have to try it first? And it’s not a “Christmas beer”? But an IPA? …seriously, folks, (failed sarcasm aside) where does anyone get the sense that this is a a spiced winter warmer? Does anyone actually try it? I’ve never gotten the sense that it’s anything but what it is—and that is a delicious IPA! So, now that I’ve said my piece, on to the beer.  This pours a rich caramel-gold, lots of foam that slowly dies down while releasing all sorts of wonderful aromas. There’s a lot of hoppiness here—some light pine and evergreen and a big citrus leaning towards grapefruit. Absolutely tasty, with the citrusy and woodsy flavors backed by a sweet and caramelly malt backing.

The beer tastes well-balanced, with pine coming through underneath some nice spice. The malts are subdued but add a nice touch of sweetness. Bitter piney finish.  Mouthfeel is sticky.

T - Mildly sweet in the front but quickly moves into a pleasantly strong bitterness with a lot of the notes from the nose, most notably piney, grapefruit, even a hint of spicy. Big hop flavor.  MF - Medium-full in body, but not heavy. Pretty drinkable, ample carbonation, and smooth mouthfeel. Nice bitter dry finish.  O - A nice IPA for winter, that sort of works. Smells, tastes, feels nice.

140,1904,KajII,3.53,"[Best served in a Shaker glass]  The pour was a clear dark amber brown with a large (2-3 finger) off white rocky head that lasted throughout and had some really good lacing.  The aroma had a moderate dose of pine hops, a generous portion of grain and barley malts and a soapy yeast with notes of caramel, citrus and some nice wintery spices (clove and coriander I believe).  The taste was mildly bitter with a note of caramel and just a little orange at first then became moderately bitterer and a bit hoppy with notes of grapefruit and a big dose of spices at the end. The flavor lasted a nice long time after the swallow with a nice strong hop presence and a touch of spice.

T: Tastes about what you'd expect from smelling it (and from Sierra Nevada). It's go some sweet malts, but the dominant flavor comes from the resinous hops, which bring a nice amount of bitterness and bring the dry finish.  M: Light-to-moderate in terms of body, and also fairly heavy on the carbonation.  O: This beer tastes like it comes from Sierra Nevada to be sure. It tastes like a slightly less hoppy version of their pale ale. I'm not sure what makes it an ""ale for the holidays."" But the price was right, and it's certainly a drinkable beer.

But now, on to the drinking. WOW! this beer rocks! perfectly balanced hop bitterness and floral notes. Definately not a dry finish, but rather, a lingering aftertaste that serves as the beer equivalent of after glow. A reminder of what a great beer you just had. For me there are generally four categories of beer. those that suck, those i would drink for free but wont spend money on, those i like and happily spend money on, and those that are particularly impressive and noteworthy. This one is in the latter category, and there are not a lot of beers i place in that category. I bought it as a single but i will be looking for a sixpack next time i go.

140,1904,nsabo,3.89,"Two points: 1) Sierra Nevada, you have have a reputation for tradition, why brew an IPA (something I can find anytime of the year) instead of a winter warmer (something I can only find once a year)?  2) It is difficult to review this without referencing their Torpedo IPA, sorry for those who aren't familiar with it.  SN brews always have a noticeable ""fresh"" taste about them, this beer is by far the freshest. Like Torpedo, this tastes more like a wet, sweet malty English IPA than a drier, hopped-up American IPA. Hops are still prevalent, though: very floral, piney with tart grapefruit and wet, but not sticky, finish. Mouthfeel is smooth but surprisingly not very heavy, almost like it’s on nitro. I enjoy Torpedo, this just tastes like a fresher, hoppier, smoother version.

140,1904,JoLight,4.1,"I had the 2011 version.  It's a dark honey color, slightly amber but not quite. The head is about three shades off white. It retains very well and leaves a shit-load of lacing.  The aroma consists mainly of a strong hop-forward smell. There's the slightest bit of barley malt, some slight citrus notes (grape fruit rhine), that sweet gummy bear/candy smell, slightly pineapple. But I mostly get a piney hoppiness, but more like a magnolia pinecone, and not a pine tree pinecone. And mixed with that is sort of a Fraser Fur Christmas tree tartness.  The taste is hop-forward. mostly piney hops. No real citrus, or at least not as much as I suspected. It's also not nearly as sweet as one might suspect from the aroma. The barley malt is there, but the hops hide it to an almost unbalanced extent, in my opinion.  Mouthfeel is on the wet side of dry. It's crisp. It's refreshing, and not too filling.  It struck me at first as being identical to the Torpedo. But as I became more familiar with it, this beer has much less malt presence, and is not as sweet. Also, the citrus is less present, but not by much though. However, if you aren't very experienced in taste and aroma nuances, you probably won't be able to tell the difference between this and the Torpedo, except maybe that the Torpedo is much sweeter and maltier.  Anywho, good brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Aroma produced big pine hop notes with citrus hops in the background.  Pine hop dominated taste. Grapefruit and maybe a little bit of lime zest makes up the rest of this beer. This one is definitely hop dominated. Not a whole lot of subtle background flavors.  Medium bodied and very carbonated. Maybe a little too carbonated in my opinion... Drying hop aftertaste, hop dragon breath coats every inch of your mouth.  Overall, this is a solid as hell six pack. A very great, widely available IPA for the holiday season. Maybe a tad overcarbonated... but other than that, an exceptional IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DocDownUnder,4.23,"12oz into an Imperial Pint glass  A- Burnt orange to copper with a frothy white head, considerable lacing.  S-Sweet pine and citrus...grapefruit, lime.  T-Smooth, with sweet and lush (fresh) hops. The citrus is a lingering flavor with moderate bitterness. The citrus almost reminds me of the lime on the Tostitos lime corn chips, which isn't exactly lime.  M-Almost sticky, and definitely not dry, medium to full bodied.  O-Delicious, one of the best straight IPAs I've had.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: Citrusy/fruity hops and floral notes...mostly grapefruit, orange peel and grape juice. Add to that a touch of grass.  T: A sublime balance of pine resin and zesty grapefruit. That gives way to light-biscuity malt and a tongue tingling punch of bitterness in the finish.  M: Medium body, above average carbonation. Dryer than SNPA, but not nearly as parching as Torpedo.  O: I’m not going to lie..this is a beer that I always look forward to and drink in quantity during the holiday season. I could pretty much write this review from memory. Long live Celebration!

140,1904,jsdunlop,4.23,"2011  Light amber, massive carbonation visible, head retention and quality is excellent. Lots of pine, grapefruit and citrus notes in the nose. Slightly bitter at first, malty sweetness then leads into the resiny pine needles blended with mixed tropical fruit. Finishes dry with a lasting impression of the hop assault from the first sip. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel to this one. Moderate carbonation,extremely refreshing. A great IPA, try it out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MaxSpang,4.23,"Served in a tulip.  APPEARANCE  Celebration is a reddish-orange and slightly hazy ale resting under a full off white head. The soapy head is about 2-3 fingers, and disappears very slowly. There was a ton of beautiful lacing along the glass, making this beer beautiful the whole way through.  SMELL  The hops. Oh, the hops. It smells worthy of a celebration. Lots of citrus, hop spice, floral character, pine tree, and grapefruit zest. The pine is almost like a resiny pine sap aroma, and works well. Almost like a Christmas tree? Not quite that piney, but it's a definite big American hop aroma. There is a bit of malty sweetness and bread-like aroma, but for the most part it's all hop - yum.  TASTE  Big, bold hop flavor and bitterness. The hop flavors are big amounts of pine, citrus, grapefruit pith, hop spice, and a nice amount of floral notes. Lots of bitterness, which leaves an almost resiny feeling in the mouth. There's some juicy fruit notes, like slight tropical fruits and tangerine. There's a bit of maltiness, grain, and bread flavors at the end of the toungue which compliments te bitter notes nicely.  MOUTHFEEL  The brew would about as easy drinking as they come if it wasn't for the bitterness. Even with the bitterness, though, it almost drinks like water. There's a perfect amount of carbonation that enhances the spicier flavors. The beer is mostly dry, but there's a bit of body that lubricates the mouth slightly.  OVERALL  What an awesome beer. It's very much a hop lovers beer, and anyone expecting holiday spices is in for a surprise. I could have this beer in a normal beer drinking rotation, but part of the charm is that you can only get it one time of the year - hence the name of the beer. I thoroughly enjoy this beer.  Cheers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Not much sweetness to speak of just lots of hops  Mouthfeel : medium bodied ipa not overly carbonated, just right in my opinion.  Overall : The lacing really stands out in this beer, very well done. This beer caught me off guard I wasn't expecting it to be this good.

140,1904,DCon,4.22,"Bought a 12 FL. OZ. bottle of this from Lukas Liquor in Ellisville, MO for $1.49. Poured from the Red Labeled bottle w/ ""2011"" on the neck, a Winter Cabin covered w/ snow in the middle of the main label, & the classic S.N. brand across the entire bottle into a 16oz iTap Passport Pint Glass. Has 1305 116 17 on the side of the bottle. Still wish I knew what this meant from this brewery...  Aroma- Is this the name the type of herb thats in this brew game? Tons of skunk, grassy, piney, and citrus hop that blows you away! Very sweet background as well. Tremendous but expect nothing less than perfect from Sierra Nevada!  Appearance- Pours a 3 finger head thats bubbly and lasts longer than your girlfriend could even imagine! Has a reddish/copper colored body that is very clear. Leaves VERY thick lacing with rings and tons of bubbles.  Flavor- Has a ton of mango and citrus hop flavor from the beginning. Very high and great character! However, I don't care much for the finish. Medium hop bitterness finish it off and wish there was more... Even the S.N. Pale Ale has a bitterness that blows this one away!  Mouthfeel- Medium Bodied, Medium-High Carbonation, Smooth, Creamy, and then has more of an English IPA/ Pale Ale finish...  Overall Impression- I remember back in 07 and 08 enjoying the hell out of this brew! I only can give it a ""Good"" overall rating b/c it didn't hit all that I wanted in this style. The reason I bought this brew was b/c I'm celebrating the starting of Finals week tonight (just kidding).

140,1904,joecast,4.65,"Celebrating uni graduation. Hooray for me!! 2011 version.  High carbonation keeps the sediment flowing through the beer. Thick off white frothy head. Good lacing. Holding to light shows off the bright amber color.  Considerable pine and resin aroma. Very nice. Sharp and fresh. Like I am smelling hops still in the field. Impressive considering it has come half way around the world.  Piney hops pack a bitter punch. Aftertaste is pine as well. Easy to get distracted and focus only on the hops but the malt is well presented with light hints of biscuit sweetness but stopping short of any alcohol flavors. Hops flow right through from beginning to end. Flavor and bitterness are well integrated.  Mmm so good. While this is a bitter beast, the impact lingers but doesn't dominate making it easy to finish the bottle (and be a bit sad there is only one). not surprising this is a much anticipated release each year. SN come through with another winner.  --- *score edited after comparrison with hop ottin* version 2005. had to buy a six-pack after trying it on tap at hollingshead pours surprisingly clear deep amber. 1cm head which seems to have a slight orange tinge to it. disisipates to a thin lace leaving sheets on the glass as it drains. strong sharp citrus aroma. grapefruit brings tears to the eyes. heaps of bitterness. some thick malt sweetness keeps things in perspective. sharpness fades slightly as it warms, leaving layers of sticky beer on the mouth with each sip. certainly lives up to the hype, and a reason on its own to celebrate its release.

A - dark red colored amber. Definitely a holiday feel here. Massive off white head. Very frothy and long lasting. Head provides a superb coat of lacing that you simply don't get everyday. Head and lace are one of a kind material.  S - citrusy hop aroma with some herbal qualities. Very good aroma. Lots of fruity hops with a touch of toasted grain like Malts.  T - wow. A very good flavor here. Lots of hops up front which provide a nice bitterness. Toasted malts with a slight sweetness. A bit of an alcohol taste in the finish, but not overpowering. Some pine like hop flavor in the back end that finishes with a wonderful fresh mint taste. A small touch of orange peel as well.  M - medium bodied brew with the right amount of carbonation. Smooth and thick mouthfeel that's easy to drink.  O - this is a fantastic IPA. I'm not one to choose an IPA as my holiday beer, but this one has a Christmas feel to it with the color and taste to be downed in front of my tree in the month of December. But forget all that.

Reddish dark amber color;  I had written ""fresh hop"" for the smell before I had actually read the bottle which says on the neck ""fresh hop ale"" . Doh! Definitely lives up to its subtitle.  The fresh hoppiness is highlighted with citrusy flavors and smells. Balanced with a hint of malt. Plenty of hop bitterness and tartness with the winter warmer level of alcohol. Very clean finish and mouthfeel.  Overall, a very good AIPA but, for me, not ""out there"" enough to be a great winter seasonal.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,claspada,3.23,"2010 bottle, one year later courtesy of guezer.  Aromas of sweet pine resin mixed with some citrus. Pale malt lends a slight biscuity dryness, but the hops are really the star of this show.  The taste begins with mildly sweet and grain, but then quickly pushed aside by the hop bite. Strong bitterness combined with pine and citrus, earthy tones and a little hop spice.  The mouthfeel and finish wasn't the driest but was still very clean and massively bitter.  Not the most refreshing beer but with the the right body and carbonation for an IPA. Not stellar but worth a go once a year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MNJR,3.8,"I buy this every winter/holiday season without fail. It's always a pleasure to bring this one home. This year I'm enjoying it, but something seems a bit different. There's a piney/Listerine type hops flavor going on that I don't expect. Color is a nice golden hued amber, head is proper, lacing thin but stays intact. Smell is warm and inviting, hops being #1 in the nose. Flavor is a rich IPA with great tangerine/grapefruit notes and grainy carbonation. But, there is that pine sap antiseptic quality nudging through. The mouthfeel is a bit thick for my liking, and while the flavor is good, after one or two it gums up your tasting apparatus a bit. A very good beer, but I think this year (2011) it could be better, or maybe I remember it differently than it actually is.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Bitter hops up front, followed by some sweet and toasty malts, finished by piney and maybe some orange rind tasting hops.  M: Nice long finish with some prickly carbonation.  O: Really nice beer. Super happy I got to try it. It is one of the better IPA's I've had and at it's price you really can't beat it. Almost wish it was around all of the time.

Some nice cling to the side of the glass as you drink.  S- Good hoppy notes with a hint of some malty pine and a touch of maple perhaps?  T- Big hops in there up front. At 65 IBUs it really does shine. The caramel malt comes through towards the finish with the hop bitterness lingering in the finish. Picking up a bit of the alcohol in the finish as well but it's very minimal.  M- Just a perfect feel to this beer. Carbonation is right and it has a smooth finish and clean feel to it.

Some grassiness in the hop aroma too, but not dank. A bit of spiciness. Malt provides some initial sweetness to the aroma. No noticeable yeast aroma or esters.  Flavor is sweet malt, some caramel, and a substantial up front hop bitterness that carries throughout each taste, but is never too sharp. The hop flavor is reminiscent of mandarin oranges.  Medium body, creamy, moderate carbonation, and a moderately dry finish due to the big hop taste.

Caramel maltiness is present too and immediately displays the backbone that this beer has.  T: Tons of pine followed by a really rich caramel malt. This beer has a really great balance struck with the rich malts. The bitterness isn't overwhelming in the slightest. The hops have a really floral finish. The alcohol is tough to notice.  M: Light to medium body. Nice creaminess with great carbonation.  O: It's always stunning to me how different fresh hopped beers are to dry hopped beers.

The taste is piney hops with a little citrus and some malt on the back. See a lot of reviews saying citrus hops dominate, but I certainly wouldn't say that compared to citrusy IPAs like Two Hearted.

There also seems to be a bit of a cherry or almond flavour that I don't remember from the 2010 version.. It ends with a malty sweet fruity aftertaste with a nice dose of hop bitterness.

There is a lot of complexity though. Some caramel smoked malts. I believe I get some fruity sweetness too--I'm not great at this but I'd say perhaps citrus and strawberry.  T: Bitter hops very well balanced with sweet malt. The end of the taste is just slightly acidic--maybe reflecting the fruit in the nose, but then immediately becomes a refeshing bitterness.  M: Very smooth. Minimal carbonation. Minimal alcohol.  O: A fantastic ale. Truly a pleasure. Refreshing and well-balanced. Although this is characterized as an IPA I have heard of people aging it.

S - Big pine aroma with a nice amount of pineapple and a touch of caramel and toasted malts.  T - Nice punch of hops up front. Lots of pine and earthy hops. Just enough of a malt presence to add some depth, this caramel, bread and toasted malts all coming through. Despite the malt, this is a great hop-forward taste that has nice bitterness, but is not one dimensional in the slightest.  M - Medium mouthfeel with a nice dry bitter finish.

I see a lot of other reviewers describe it as piney? I'm still trying to distinguish piney smells in hops. Either way, you can tell this is gonna be a hoppy one.  T- The hops hit you up front as most IPAs do. I'm picking up lots of citrus flavor that attack the tongue. Very tasty caramel malts to balance it out.  M- I struggle with reviewing mouthfeel, but this one stands out. Because of the thick head that remained throughout, this had a great creamy mouthfeel on the way down.  O- Very tasty beer.

The same, except cloudier when i poured in the last bit with yeast.  Smell: Just cracking open the bottle fills the room with piney notes. Lots of pine and pineapple with a good amount of sweetness.  Taste: Loads of hoppiness dominated again with piney flavors. Despite the dominance of hops in this brew, there is great balance, with the caramel malt backbone always showing, but allowing the hops to take center stage.  Mouthfeel: Pretty light, especially when compared to most IPAs. Hop bitterness lingers in a dried mouth. Crisp and fresh as the hops used to make it. Honestly the first time I can remember thinking a beer's feel was unique.  Overall: A great example of the style, though it doesn't really do anything to add to it.

140,1904,lazjuarez,4.2,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler. Bottle stamped: 127720753  A: Pours a beautiful red/orange sunset color, slightly hazy due to the finishing pour containing a bit of yeast sediment. About 2 fingers worth of a billowy yellow head that sticks around and leaves great sticky resinous lacing. Lots of carbonation coming off the bottom of the glass  S: Upfront, nose is big on floral piney notes, some grapefruit, and as it warms some malt sweetness. No spices, but inclined to believe there isn't any even being a seasonal brew.  T: Nice bitter astringency, drying and bold. Biscuity malt adds a good balance as well.  M: Medium bodied, biscuity mouthfeel ,nice carbonation, and good drying effect. Overall a great IPA anytime of the year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,blackcompg,3.83,"Just finally found this in my neck of the woods.  Appearance - Poured two fingers of thick pillowy yellow head, color of the beer is a hazy apricot amber, really a gorgeous beer. Nice thick lacing left in the glass.  Smell - Citrus, grapefruit, touch of pineapple sweetness. Smells very nice.  Taste - Whoah, this beer is all about the hops! Very eye opening and refreshing. Here are the flavors - citrus peel, grapefruit, grassy floral hops, a touch of dry biscuit, and pine long into the finish. There are no spices here folks - NONE.  Mouthfeel - Lite to medium mouthfeel, smooth foamy carb with some crisp edges, drying and bitter on the finish.  Overall - Surprised to find such a nice hop missile during the winter months! I would LOVE to enjoy this on a hot summer day. I don't get the spices mentioned by other reviewers at all, NONE. This is a straight up IPA folks, NOT a winter warmer. I also got very little sweetness here, would have preferred a bit more to balance, otherwise an excellent IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Dubber55,4,"Bottled sometime early in October 2011  A slightly hazy golden color with 1 finger of off white head  The smell is obviously wet, danky, eathy hops- a strong, powerful minty hop aroma initially- then I get plenty of pine, grass, grapefruit, and some booze. There is some toasted bread in the background.  Strong spicy hop bitterness initially- some of the flavors include mint, pine, booze, grapefruit. In the background there is a light malt backbone with a decent amount of toasted bread.  Mouthfeel is solidly medium with some light carbonation. Pretty smooth.  The hop bitterness is kind of abrasive as well as the alcohol considering this beer is only around 7%. Doesnt really seem to be that complex either. The toasted bread provides a little bit of balance. Not really my thing but a solid IPA",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,StoutHunter,4.41,"I picked up a bottle of Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale last week for $1.59 at The Lager Mill. I had this beer last year in the summer and it was still a really hoppy and good tasting ale, so I am interested to see what it is like when it is much fresher, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date. Poured from a short brown 12ox bottle into an imperial pint glass.  A- The label on this beer looks good, it has a pretty fitting holiday theme to it. It poured a nice slightly hazy orangish amber color with four fingers worth of fluffy white head that died down to a thick layer that stayed till the end and left lots of nice lacing. This is one damn good looking beer.  S- The aroma of this beer is all about the hops. I pick up a nice 50/50 mixture of citrus and floral/piny hops with the citrus hops sticking out slightly more with some nice grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, and mango aromas. The malt base of this beer is still apparent in the aroma and imparts a nice caramel and biscuit like aroma. This beer has a pretty nice aroma.  T- The taste of this beer is more balanced then the aroma was. It starts off with that nicely done malt base that has a medium amount of sweetness and imparts some nice caramel, biscuit, and a slight brown bread flavor. After that comes the hops which impart a nice and fresh hop flavor that is mainly floral with some piny, citrus, and spicy hop flavors that make for a really nice mixture that isn't too dominating and still lets the malt backbone come through. The finish has a light amount of medium bitterness and it has a biscuity aftertaste with a little bit of floral hops.  M- Really smooth, medium bodied, and it had a high amount of medium carbonation that really worked well with this beer. The mouthfeel is exactly what a good IPA should be like.  Overall I thought this was one damn good American IPA, that somehow manages to set itself apart from all the other IPA's with a flavor that really works for the winter time and is a nice departure from the typical Winter Warmer seasonals. This beer had great drinkability, it had very good balance which isn't that common in American IPA's and it wasn't that bitter, I could definitely drink three or four of these in a sitting and it also goes very well with a nice holiday dinner. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, the aroma, taste, look, and mouthfeel were all spot on in my opinion. There wasn't anything that I didn't like or would change about this beer, it's great just the way it is. I will for sure be buying this beer again and I like the fact that it comes in twelve packs, it makes for a good beer to keep on hand for holiday partys. I highly recommend this beer, especially if you are tired of the large amount of heavily spiced winter seasonals. I can't say enough good things about this beer, so far this is one of my favorite Sierra Nevada sesonals, and a great American IPA. Great job guys this is one classic winter beer that I don't see going out of style anytime soon.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,robmorris31,3.98,"Great Ale! One of the most versatile seasonal Winter Ales on the market! The 2011 version is a little hoppier (is that a word, lol?) than the previous years, but this is due to the climate changes experienced on the California coast this past year.  Pairings are great with spicy food: wings, chili  Its bitter finish is perfect for quelling a fire.  The 6.8% ABV is pretty bold but worth the extra time to sober-up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,NuclearDolphin,4.32,"Poured into a 16oz Tulip Glass  Appearance - Hazy Dark Amber, probably one of the most unfiltered IPAs I have ever seen. Not too much as far as head goes.  Smell - There's your typical piney hop and citrus smell but it's surprisngly subtle. There's a stronger than usual caramel smell, which gives it more of a sweeter aroma than most IPAs.  Taste - Much like the smell the piney hops aren't that strong but it does have somewhat of a bite on the back of the palette, same goes for the citrus flavor as well. However, the caramel and spicy flavors (which wasn't present in the smell), give this IPA more of a distinct, sweeter taste. There's also some yeast flavoring in here, something which you don't really see in IPAs. The aftertaste is also a combination of a sweet yeasty flavor and a subtle hoppy flavors. I also get a warm feeling from this beer, much like a winter warmer.  Mouthfeel - It's pretty thick for an IPA, thanks in part to the slight sediment. There's also a decent amount of carbonation, but it goes along very well with the flavor.  Overall - This is an excellent seasonal IPA. With it's unique sweet and subtle hoppy flavors along it's spiciness, all this makes it an outstanding IPA. This isn't the hoppiest IPA around, but it still makes it a damn good one to drink!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,augustgarage,4.08,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass.  Burnt orange to tangelo gradient with a touch of flame and amber in the highlights. Soapy beige foam recedes from three fingers to one leaving thick webs of lacing in its wake. Subsequent gulps leave behind a stream of sandy fast running foam. Good retention.  Light pine notes and orange zest in the nose along with pink peppercorn and caramel malt. Very aromatic with a great deal of subtlety.  Lovely malt and spice notes lend the flavor profile a winter warmer feel at first. Fresh hops contribute a not-quite-moderate bitterness throughout but deliver fully on flavor. The impact is not immediate, but the spicy/fruity freshness builds and develops complexity (for example: vanilla?) long into the medium-dry finish. Malt supports throughout but seems less intrusive than in many of their other beers.  Medium-light bodied, creamy, well carbonated.  The 2011 vintage, still quite fresh, is drinking very well...quite an enjoyable example of the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Immortale25,4.5,"Poured into a snifter. No readable freshness date.  A- Pours a medium copper color with a fluffy one finger head that's retaining quite well...actually, very well. After a solid couple of minutes it's still at a 1/4 inch thick and slowly shrinking. Not a lot of lacing.  S- A sweet hop smell that's accompanied by some spice reminiscent of cinnamon, a touch of honey and maybe some clove and nutmeg.  T- Nice blast of citric hops upfront that, along with the spiciness, overpower the malts for the most part. Tastes like SN's Pale Ale with more umph across the board and some spice added. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Some cereal grain sweetness comes in the aftertaste after multiple sips.  M- High carbonation makes this one memorable and sensational.  O- I know there's a huge following for this beer and, though I've had it before and liked it, I never understood why it was so sought after. Now I know. Excellent.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Caramel notes, slight biscuit. Would place the alcohol higher than 6.8% but that's fine with me!  M- Wonderful full mouthfeel, good carbonation.  D/O- One of the better IPAs most will have although I will admit I'd rather have it be a seasonal, add to the experience I feel. Brings back memories every winter I have it!

140,1904,Morey,4.33,"12oz bottle with the top label boasting 2011 in plain view. Being that this is their holiday/winter seasonal, that pretty much gives you a basic idea of how fresh or old this beer is.  Pours an ever so slightly hazy reddish brown color with two fingers worth of cream colored frothy head. Plenty of lacing on the glass. A good looking brew.  Evergreen/pine/spruce like aroma (definitely not a citrus smelling Ipa). I know that this beer isn't spiced, but I could see why one might think so if they didn't already know better. Faint nutmeg and cinnamon in the background.  Taste- Pleasant and spicy bitterness up front. Malt body adds some texture midway. The hop flavor never really leaves the palate, reminding you that you're drinking a bold and flavorful beer (even when you're not actually drinking it).  Medium bodied with a soft carbonation and a lingering bitterness.  This is a unique Ipa. Some seem to taste SO similar, but not the tried and true Celebration Ale!  Morey's Bottom Line: A must buy every year. It's not the most drinkable Ipa, but hey, it's a winter seasonal after all. If you're not into hoppy/bitter beers, steer clear. Otherwise, this is one of the best holiday ales for your $$$.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,IPhantom,4.62,"I cannot believe I never got around to reviewing this beer. It's probably the beer that's most responsible for me going nuts for craft beer (that wasn't made by Magic Hat). This review is the 2011 version (obviously).  Goldenish amber in the glass, with a thumb-thick biscuity looking head. Lacing is sticky as hell and stays through the whole glass, with clouds hanging high over the pillow. The nose is, well...everything good about hops. You like pine? Herbs? Spice? They're all in there. I'd wear this beer like a cologne, but that might get me fired. There's a little bit of caramel back there too for good measure.  Taste is of course all hops up front. To me, this batch seems less grapefruity than in past years. There's still a lot of delightful citrusy hops up front, but less aggressive than I remember. As for the malt character, the best way I can describe it is like sweet potato fries with a little bit of an anise note. All of this tastes way better together than that description would indicate.  Mouthfeel is on the bubbly side, crisp and a little bit sticky with that citrusy aftertaste. The first few sips with a big head on it are the best. Virtually no alcohol at all for 6.8%.  This beer is one of my top picks for winter, pretty much perpetually. It's sessionable if you're careful and goes great with all that holiday food you're gonna be shoveling down. Highly recommended, as always.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Head dissipates rather quickly but leaves a fair amount of lacing. Slightly hazy body. Looks great.  S- Wow, interesting. Piney hops, sweet biscuits, brown sugar, its all in there. Just a hint of booze as well. The aroma packs a whallop.  T- This is a great tasting beer. As expected, its sweet with this almost cinnamon sugar toast flavor that pairs nicely with the fresh spicey, piney hops. Delicate bitterness dances on the tongue and leaves a brown sugar aftertaste. Little to no alcohol present.  M- Good body, pretty slick across the tongue. Moderate carbonation. Its a pretty typical mouthfeel for an IPA.  O-This is another great brew from SN. Unlike most of their mainliners, this one really packs a flavor punch. Loads of fresh, spicey hops and sweet caramel malt really give ya a solid sock in the mouth (in a good way). This is a real palette pleaser for IPA fans. Worth seeking out. I might even throw one in the cellar for 6 months.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Specs of lacing all the way down the glass. Clear orange(mostly)-red colored beer.  T & M: great bitterness in the finish. Some biscuit malts in the mid taste. Smooth medium body, low amounts of carbonation bit still some sting. The power of the taste is really back based, not much taste right away.

Makes you want to taste it for sure.  T: The taste is of spicy, fresh hops with notes of caramel, apple and citrus, especially grapefruit. For me it finishes with a slight malt base taste, although dry. Amazing!  M: Good carbonation for 6.8 with a medium thick but smooth mouthfeel  O: The richer, spicier ""holiday"" taste elements are all beautifully tamed and balanced with bitter hops in what is a fantastic IPA.

Strong piney hops profile supported by a darker malt tone and accented with citrus notes on the top.  T: The bitter hops make the body of this flavor. As the bitterness crescendos towards excessive, the toasted malt sweetness steps in to relieve your palate.  M: Small, fizzy bubbles give playfulness to the otherwise smooth mouthfeel. The lacing is still very sticky, clings to your mouth. The alcohol gives this beer a wonderful warmth.  O: The result is a super drinkable IPA, perfect for a chilly evening.

Upon first whiff I could smell numerous citrus aromas coming from the Cascade and Centennial hops that are generously used in this brew. In addition to hopping the beer when first brewed, Sierra Nevada dry hops Celebration after the first stage of fermentation is complete giving the beer it's bold aroma. The first sip of Celebration is reminiscent to shaking hands with an old friend; warm, inviting and friendly.

Sticky grapefruit peel, pine, cedar woodiness, and a spicy hop character...probably the wet hops. Large floral hop presence! Very good. Pretty complex.  Mouth/Taste: A pretty big citrus hop bitterness balanced by a very fresh caramel hop. Citrus, grapefruit peel, cedar wood, floral hops, and a semi-dry finish. EDiT: Later i noticed a certain funk that i had not previously noticed. Frothy and semi- dry in the mouth but not overpowering. Masterful balance.  Overall: SN is one of the world's best breweries. Almost always 85-90 material at the least. Not a big beer, but a quality session beer for the holidays. recommended, though not sure f 'll see out again. Not something i'd buy by the case but i'll buy another six next year probably. but thats probably more due to the fact of style preference more than a hit to the brew. ""A"" beer material.

Overall a great 2011 celebration ale. Perhaps a bit more balanced and mintier than previous annual releases...maybe the growing season produced more mint and spice in the hops.

I'm guessing that this is unfiltered because I can see a lot of hop particulate likely from dry hopping. Head is rocky and pure white.  S - Sweet grain and resinous hops. Fruity ethers.  T - A very nice sweetness from the modified grains. Hops are very floral up front and have a nice bitterness at the end. Pine and grapefruit. I also get a vegetal or grassy like quality from the hops.  M - Full, thick and sticky. moderate carbonation. No noticeable alcohol burn.  O - A very nice beer.

I'm not sure if this is because of the marketing behind the beer or not but it tastes like someone picked whole cone hops off a vine and threw them in a giant vat of water and then you smelled that vat. There is a slight tinge of soapiness to the hop aroma that is undesirable.  T - A very bitter and hoppy flavor throughout. A very slight dankness to the flavor with most of it being overpowered by the sheer American hop flavor. A slight nutty taste in the finish somewhere is very welcomed.

This beer has a fantastic, strong malt foundation that is capped by the fresh hops, providing great balance and a transition from bread-biscuit malt taste to wonderful fresh resinous bitter pine flavors. The malts also kick off some caramel flavors. Kind of like SNPA on steroids. The hops provide all kinds of interesting flavors, to include pine, slight citrus, pineapple, and tobacco.  Mouthfeel is rich from the malts and slick from the hop oils. Overall goes down very smoothly with a nice amount of carbonation.  In conclusion, this is a delightful holiday brew. Very festive and provides an added punch for cold winter days. Not a spiced beer, so again, sets itself apart from many other holiday offerings. Without a doubt a go-to winter seasonal brew. Go-to? What the heck, it's awesome fresh-hop glory!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BrianOhio,4.12,"A semi aggressive pour will give you a 2-3 finger head with good retention and lacing. Hazy pale orange in the glass.  Aroma is a nice mix of citrus/pineapple, mixed with some pine notes typical in an IPA style.  I've often felt the packaging is rather misleading on this one, as you're expecting a Christmas warmer, and you (happily in my case) experience one of the better fresh hop ales out there. Bright citrus is balanced with a not too harsh pine finish - fresh is the best way to describe it, and it's not a bruiser.  In the fresh hop space, this is one of the best out there in my opinion. And the price makes it one of the best values in a quality beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TenHornsProud,4.3,"Pours a solid orange with a white head that dissipates quickly.  Smells of bready, biscuit, cracker malt and pine hop character.  Taste is up front cracker malt with some pine hop that fades into some grapefruit character and ends on a bitter and sweet kick with a lasting malt/hop finish...hard to describe but that's what makes this beer so great.  Lighter to medium body with medium carbonation work well for the style. The alcohol is well hidden.  A great IPA that mixes pine hop and bready, cracker malt perfectly. There is a unique quality to this beer that doesn't quite sink in until halfway through the beer....I look forward to this every year of course.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cbbjr,4.32,"Pours a hazy amber gold with off white head that leaves a lot of lacing. Smells of citrus hops with a bit of pine. The taste is heavier on pine, but you still get citrus and spice. Medium bodied and very drinkable.  Bravo to Sierra Nevada for going way outside of the box on a winter seasonal. This is an annual holiday staple in my fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,sweemzander,3.91,"12oz. bottle poured into a nonic. 2011 vintage. I cant believe I have never tried this yet, but better late than never!  (A)- Pours a slightly hazy copper amber color. Produced a great fluffy tan to orange colored head with great retention and tons of lace.  (S)- A nice dry pine up front with some nice citrus and subtle caramel malt.  (T)- Same as the smell only backwards: The citrus and caramel malt up front with the dry pine on the finish. Simple, but tastes good.  (M)- A smooth carbonation level and a great balance of malt and hops without one overpowering the other.  (D)- A solid IPA, though maybe not as ""Holiday"" or ""Festive"" for this time of the year as other beers out there, but it is a solid example for the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Mahgeetah527,3.78,"Poured into a Allagash chalice.  Smells of fresh piney & resiny hops. There is a little bit of malt in the background to round out the massive hop presence.  Pours a golden amber hue with 2 fingers of white fluffy head There is significant lacing left behind with each sip.  The taste starts off with fresh bitter grapefruit. Some pine and more citrus come through in the finish. Much like the smell the malt backbone rounds out the hops making this not a true ""hop bomb"" but a pretty well balanced IPA.  Mouthfeel and carbonation are medium.  Since I'm not really a fan of typical Winter Seasonals, this beer is one to look forward to this time of year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JustinAniello,3.48,"A - Pours a cloudy light copper with a two finger head. Dissipates to a nice cap and lacing that sticks to the sides.  S - Citrus and pine from the hops takes up most aroma. Light malt is in the background.  T - Lightly sweet malt at first that blends into heavy piney notes and bitterness. The bitterness lingers for a while afterwards.  M - Medium body, pretty heavy carbonation. Lighter carbonation would be better.  O - Not a bad IPA, but certainly not one of the best. The piney hop bitterness over powers the other flavors, it needs to be toned down.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TappaKeggaBrew,3.55,"A: Pours orange-amber, with a medium haze. Golden head isn't thick, but has fairly good retention, and light lacing on the walls of the glass.  S: Sweet malt and aromatic hops in equal measure. After a couple of whiffs, I detect some citrus notes. Pretty typical for an IPA.  T: Holy bitterness, Batman! There isn't much room for the malt or anything else. After the bitterness of excessive hops fades, the citrus makes a faint appearance, and I might detect a hint of diacetyl.  M: Crisp, good carbonation.  O: I should point out that I'm not a huge American IPA fan, and although drinkable (and slightly above average in the class, in my opinion), this one didn't change my position; the bitterness was just too overwhelming for me to give it good marks.

Pours a beautiful bright cloudy orange with a huge rocky head that sticks around for the entire ride. Man, this beer looks fresh.  The nose is all hops. Big piny and grapefruity notes dominate with a touch of malt.  Taste follows suit with bright hoppy flavors: citris, pine, etc. The mouthfeel is pleasant enough with solid carb and a quick dryness. Excellent bitter notes.  Really enjoyed this beer and this may be the beer that brings me back to enjoying IPAs again.

Smells like lemon pledge in the best way.  A- again extremely bright lemon and bitter grapefruit rind, pine, light sweetness.  O- this beer is not under the radar at all, but if you haven't had it yet you should.

140,1904,azdback,3.3,"2011 vintage poured into a Phoenix Ale Brewery pint glass. A very clear and bright orange red color. Very few carbonation bubbles lead to a creamy, off white colored one finger head. Lace looks pretty sticky for now, but fades quickly and never recovers.  Smell is pretty bright and citrusy. Fresh, green hop resins are there and aren't overpowering but they are for sure there. I am getting just a hint of earthy malts and hard to find.  Taste is much more on the musty malts and hops side than the nose. Very tart bitter. Yellow grapefruit rind and wheat grass juice.  Mouth is a bright and on the spritzy side. Body is a bit thin and the finish is medium/short and dry.  Overall I don't think this is a great example of an IPA never mind a fresh hop IPA. The earthy flavors really ruin this ones potential. If you are an East Coast IPA guy (or girl) you will probably like this. Otherwise leave it alone.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A- Huge frothy 3 finger head, bubbly lacing, dissipates slowly, slight hazy brown/burnt orange color, decent amount of sediment. S- Slight hops comes out in the aroma, citrus, slight grapefruit, the malts take over the aroma though, bready/nutty notes come out. T- The taste is more hop forward, citrus, grapefruit, slight pine, breadiness comes out, big malt characteristics, decent bitterness. M- Medium mouth feel, well carbonated, dry finish. O- Solid beer, glad to finally try it, I see it all the time and always pass it up.

It has a good amount of hop flavor in the taste which contrasts with the malt forward aroma on the nose. Its a bit more hoppy than I tend to prefer but its not bad, I would definitely drink it if it was offered. Its hard to go wrong with Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,lawlerj,3.98,"Poured direct from the frige, from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  A - pours a hazy amber with a big frothy off white to tan head. Very fluffy looking. Appears to leave a generous amount of lacing. It doesn't appear to be overly carbonated. A beautiful looking beer.  S - big hops upfront obviously. There is a nice mix of citrus hops and undertones of the juicy/fruity hops. There is a hint of a malt base, but the hops are what dominate here.  T - strong hops dominate pretty much through the entire flavor profile. Very strong citrus/grapefruit flavors. I'm not getting much in the way of a malt backbone when cold, but this comes out more as the beer warms, with some caramel and bread undertones that beging to show through.  M - medium bodied, moderately carbonated. A bit sticky feeling, but not in a bad way at all.  O - overall, a nice beer. I enjoy the winter seasonal IPAs and pale ales as a change of pace from the winter warmer seasonals (which I love), and this is a very enjoyable offering from Sierra Nevada. Very good, as always.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Aroma: sprucey, citrusy, malty, clearly an American IPA. The evergreen aroma of the Hops is such a Christmas reminder.  Mouthfeel: Full.  Taste: restrained flavors of the Hops are joyful; Orange Marmelade and cedar or spruce are buoyed by a big malty bed.  Notes: tasty, invigorating, joyful. One doesn't think of an IPA as a Winter Seasonal but this one has the right balance between Hops and Malt and the senses are actually reminded of the smells of Christmas. Wow. This one is gonna be a keeper.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smell: There is a loarge amount of hops in the smell and a hint of citrus to continue. maybe some caremel. this is a pleasent smell for thanksgiving.  Taste: There is a strong citrus smell and hops an a hint of grapefruit. There is a hint of pine and it is a solid beer.  Mouthfeel: This is a medium bodied IPA that has a little more excess carbonation than i would have liked.  Overall: An enjoyable beer one that was reccommended to me but not one that lived up to the hype.  Serving type: bottle,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,LeeryLeprechaun,4.2,The beer poured a nice bright color with a very subtle red hue. The head was lovely and fluffly and is always a great indicator of a quality beer.  The aroma was of citrus hops mixed with basic malt aroma. A very pleasant and refreshing aroma for a holiday beer.  The taste was of sweet with a nice malt background. The finish was of hops and left the mouth with only a slightly bitter aftertaste.  The mouthfeel was smooth and full bodied.  Overall this was a pretty decent holiday beer. I did not think it was an amazing IPA though. The hops did not have a lot of depth or variety. I would also have preferred something with a little more bitterness for an IPA.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Huge six fingers of off white head that keeps growing after being poured. Very good retention and lots of lacing around the glass. Looks great.  Smell: Big aroma of fresh hops upfront. Strong presence of citrus hops with hints of grapefruit and oranges. Also a noticeable presence of oily pine resin. A strong aroma of bready caramel and toffee malts adds some sweetness to the aroma. Also a light hint of spices. Smells full and balanced.  Taste: Strong taste of citrus hops upfront with notes of grapefruit and oranges. Some of the hops taste like noble hops. Lots of pine resin that lingers into the aftertaste. The bright and bitter hops are quickly balanced midway by the bready and sweet malts with caramel and toffee. Flavors are fairly bold and balance each other great. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Sticky, oily, and somewhat creamy. Very smooth. Finishes somewhat dry.  Overall: A great IPA and one of the best seasonal beers out there. Great balance of hops and malts.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - Mostly sourdough bread, but a bit of citrus from the hops, really rather clean and neutral smelling.  T - Strong, grapefruity hops that attack up front and lead into a warming malty finish.  M - Really easy to drink. Not overly carbonated and quite smooth. It's pretty easy to kill a six of this, until you stand up.  Overall, something to look forward to every Winter.

Lots of citric and oily hops. Very clean smelling. Nothing too out of the ordinary here though.  Big hop flavors. Even getting them up front. Light to medium in body, high carbonation, very crisp. Slight toasted bready malt up front, lots of pine and citric hops. Bitterness is big, but doesnt really build as I thought it would.  It's amazingly clean and has all the right flavors an IPA should have but I can't give it too high of a score due to it's seasonal availability. Would make a great any time IPA but it in no way reminds me of something I'd have in the winter.  Fantastic IPA but not as good as the hype makes it out to be. Again, I'd score it higher if it wasnt a winter seasonal as well. Definitely for hop heads though who love that flavor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jerseyjoe,4.82,what can I say about this beer that hasnt been said already? just cracked a new 2011 keg of celebration and I forgot how good this beer really is. Hops are spot on in this one. Not too overpowering but enough to enjoy the lovely hop flavor. 6.8% alcohol is slighty high for a session beer but I can see myself drinking many of them during the holiday months. I never really thought of an IPA as a winter beer but why the hell not? No doubt a go to beer during the cold winter months.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SDtastentune,4.5,"A - Darker orange with some yellow tints, more amber/orange. A nice cloud over of white sticky head, some lacing but not much .

T - Taste is great, starts bitter tasty grapefruit like, has a great malty citrus thing. Resiny pine aftertaste, but balanced to the citrus/grapefruit. Malty dark fruity and balanced on a DIPA level.  M - Sticky aftertaste and feel, medium to lower carb. Not too dry.  O - Overall this one surprised me for being cheap and everywhere right now, I like this. Lots of hop head likes and tastes. I would drink this all year.

Toasted bread malt and thick hop oil bitterness dominate the palate with some nutty bread flavors lingering a bit only to be overtaken by the hop bitterness. This has a big mouthfeel without being too syrupy. Yes, that's contradictory. Deal with it.  I heard this was an IPA, but I didn't know it was a fresh hop ale until I first drank it. I felt a sense of pride in myself for identifying it as such when I saw it was written on the label. Unlike other fresh hop beers I've had, this one was aggressive and I wasn't expecting that from Sierra Nevada. I couldn't believe that this beer is so well liked that they release it year after year. Not because it's a bad beer, but because of the aggressive hop oil presence. These hops had a more piney flavor and aroma than most other heavily hopped beers on the West coast. And I say good for Sierra Nevada for doing something different. It's a welcome change to see a fresh hop beer as a brewery's winter seasonal.

140,1904,Gatch,4.57,"I still have my first (empty) bottle of this from 2006 so I don’t know why I didn’t review it then, buuuuut, the 2011 release...  A - Cloudy amber in color with a slightly off-white head that builds into a pillowy, soft layer and settles into lumps of bubbly froth.  S - Sweet fruit and hoppy goodness. Lightly caramelized sugar.  T - Perfect combination of malt and hops. The freshness of the hops is very noticeable and the malt profile comes in through the finish to keep them from being overwhelming. Great beer.  M - Light carbonation but very smooth and the sweetness never becomes cloying. Extremely easy to drink and beckons a second or third...  Everyone seems to think this is the greatest beer ever created. I've been annoyed by it the past few years but having tried it now, I kind of see what they mean. It's a very consistent and delicious beer. Many non-beer people would enjoy this as an introduction to craft beer.  2012: Thanksgiving! Crystal-clear amber-copper in color with a big, fluffy, pillowy, off-white head. Fresh, fruity hops, toasted malt, and sweet sugary goodness. Taste is extremely balanced between bitter, oily hops and roasted, sweet malt. Goes down very easily and drinks like a charm. A bit of cloying aftertaste but that may be because it's my fourth beer of the day. Just an incredibly consistent and tasty brew that I will have no objection to when seeing it in 12-packs. It's popular and loved for a reason.  2016: Thanksgiving again! Bottled on 10/13 so about 6 weeks old. As good as I remember, with a wonderful balance of fresh hop feel and flavor against a fantastic malt bill to make this a proper cool-weather fresh hop beer. Super drinkable and almost a tradition, now.  2018: PKGD 10/01/18 so just under a month old. Not sure how it takes several weeks for the distribution chain to move this along but what can ya do. This is better than I remember. I always get excited when I see it bc it reminds me of the seasonal change but that was even stronger now that I’m in Florida. Seasonal change means highs around 80. A deliciously rich, hoppy yet malty brew that always hits the spot. And you can’t beat the price at $8.99 for a 6-pack!  2019: By far my favorite seasonal and I remember why every October/November. Incredibly well-balanced and massively flavorful. When NEIPAs become tired and repetitive, this shows up to help remind one who started it all. This tastes like the West Coast.  2021: Great to see this again. ‘Tis the season for Celebration. Canned 10/12/21 so less than a month old. Considering this was first brewed in 1981, this is the 40th Anniversary of this amazing beer! What a gorgeous and delicious beer. That’s all.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bbkd3b,4.03,"Man, I can't believe how long it's been since I've reviewed a beer. What better way to segue my way back into the old routine than something like Celebration Ale?  From the start, I can tell it'll be a satisfying brew. A shimmery, bronze/amber body fills up the glass, forming a beautiful, frothy head at the top. A nice swath of hops strikes the nose from the start - piney, grassy, and some grapefruit undertones. Getting close for that first taste reveals a bready undertone.  A smoothy body slides around the tongue. Very hoppy on the first drink, almost tongue-shocking it's so fresh. The carbonation gives this beer a real creamy character, which compliments the sprucy flavors really well. As it warms, a little more balance seeps into the flavors - some fruity undertones, and a biscuit-malt kind of taste that sneaks in at the end. Unsurprisingly, the beer goes down the tube with a bitter kick and a sort of blink-and-you'll-miss-it warming sensation. Not bad.  While an American IPA isn't exactly my idea of a winter beer, this is a really great brew. Strong flavor, beautiful lacing...

All looks well, with appropriate head and carbonation.  Aroma: Celebration has never been exceptionally fragrant, but this year it smells vaguely dank (an ominous omen).  Flavor: What once was a rock-solid malt-forward IPA has been transformed, sadly, to some tepid form of cold tea. Somewhere along the line, some marketing genius decided to append the ""fresh hop ale"" tagline to this brew and the recipe changed to fit the program. Now, the flavor is unbalanced - where once there was malt complexity, there is now the blandest malt backbone. Where once there was a complex interplay of Centennial and Cascade hops, there is now ... I don't even know what. Yard rakings?  Mouthfeel: Perfectly fine. They f'd up the recipe, but they still have quality control.

The head lasts quite a while and leaves plenty of sticky lacing.  The aroma is very hoppy with lots of pine, spicy hops, minty hops, some citrus, as well as caramel malt and a sturdy, biscuit-like malt backbone.  The taste is much like the taste with plenty of hoppiness, bitterness, and malt backbone to balance it all out. There's pine, spicy hops, mint, citrus/orange, maybe slight grapefruit, as well as some bread and biscuit. Great full flavored taste.  The consistency is smooth and velvety, the carbonation is creamy, the body is medium, and the finish is fairly quick and wet on the mouth. Nice mouthfeel as well.  Overall this a very good beer and another one that I look forward to every year.

Slightly hazy, with an enormous fluffy head that lasts several minutes and leaves coarse lacing every time you stop to drink. The head and lacing really are amazing.  Carbonation is relatively light, maybe too light. Body is medium heavy, not quite chewy. Perfect.  Lots of hop aroma - 'cascade-y', for lack of a better term (and palate). If you've had Anchor Liberty, you know how this smells, pretty much.  Bitterness is medium high and lingers quite a bit, even a little harsh. Good citrusy hop flavor, mostly grapefruit. Pretty dry, without a ton of malt character or sweetness. A little woody or grassy as well, with a hint of pine.  Far from the most interesting IPA I've had. In terms of flavor, 'character' and creativity, more like a pale ale that has been hopped up (an XPA perhaps). Much better in the bottle than on draught (which I had at Beer Revolution in Oakland, wasn't impressed). The character of the bitterness is palate destroying, so I wouldn't drink this one first. A 'solid' IPA, but not interesting enough to pick up as a seasonal, and not available enough to make it your standard IPA.

Strong aroma led by citrus and pine along with some hop resin and caramel malts. I can tell this isn't a ""bright"" IPA as I get more pine than floral. Fresh hops give a strong punch of bitterness to the taste buds, but sweetness does come around from the caramel malts. No problem with abv although the hops are enough to burn me out- I couldn't drink this all night.  This isn't a traditional winter beer, but it makes a lot of sense to sell a harvest ale in November.

I look forward to it every year, and expect to drink a ton of it as the winter sets in. It’s just plain tasty. I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to get around to reviewing it.

140,1904,JimKal,4.24,"In the past I had just given this a numerical rating without notes. Over the years I have always punched Celebration, but some years only a Sixpack. This year (2019) I have made multiple purchases as I have enjoyed this year's version. Look: dark amber with a head that doesn't stop. Significant lacing on the drink down. Smell: My standard rating for aroma. My senses are just not that developed (or perhaps faded). Taste: for me, it just sticks my taste buds as what I look for in an IPA - nice bitterness without the new fruity notes that are so popular. Feel: medium mouthfeel with nice carbonation. Overall: I will really miss Celebration when its gone. I would like to find something similar but that seems hard. The stores are full of NEIPAs that just don't appeal to me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smell: Citrus, hoppy, pine resin, malt, caramel.  Taste: Pine resin, citrus, hoppy, caramel malt, biscuit, grapefruit. Hop forward, malty towards the middle, and a bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied, creamy, moderate carbonation.  Overall: A tasty fresh hop IPA. Not what I think of when I think of holiday beers, but nonetheless, a good, drinkable beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,doopydoogle,4.2,"A - Slightly orange amber with a light head that leaves a quality lacing down the glass.  S - Caramel malts, piney hoppiness, yeasty breadiness, some citrus (lime, grapefruit, pineapple)  T - Hop forward with a citric pineyness that give way to a decent bitter. The malt then reveals a subtle fruitiness with an almost grape-like character that leads to a malty finish with residual bitter and pine notes. Hop-tastic!  M - Good carbonation and coating.  O - A wonderful IPA. Hoppy, but not overly so, and the malts give a fruitiness that balances out the floral aspects of the hops quite well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: Big citrus hops. Pineapple, grapefruit, mango, tangerine, orange and lemon zest. Resinous and fresh. Slight caramel malts peek through.  T: Slight caramel malts upfront. Then the fresh oily citrus hops come in. A good blend of pineapple, grapefruit, and orange peel. Big piney hop notes also. Very resinous. Not super bitter in the middle but grows as it finishes.  M: Light to medium body. Medium carbonation. Very slick and oily. Dry finish.  O: Very good. To bad it's not a year round brew. One of the tastier IPA's I've had.

Let's see what happens at it warms. taste: Very tasty, again not too complex just of the fridge. I do like the mellowness of the whole cone American hops. overall: Very tasty IPA. I had high expectations from this. Very tasty but didn't quite meet the bar I expected after reading so much praise. Still, a fine brew. Did not change much as it warmed.  12/12/11 edit: revisited this after all the enthusiasm shown here on ba.

140,1904,fox227,4.45,"This may be my first review of a Sierra Nevada brew, but it's far from my first tasting. I find that Sierra Nevada is consistently one of the best breweries out there, despite their scale of production.  A: Healthy two fingered head, which dissipates quickly, but the remaining wisp has excellent retention. The lacing is an elaborate drapery of white foam. And the liquid is of a medium dark amber hue.  S: This is very perfume-y on the nose, with lemon, flowers, and I even sniff some nectarines.  T: I perceive most everything on the nose, sans nectarines, combined with some resiny pine sap, an herbal burst of spicy, herbal hops, and a slight malt backbone, though hidden, of caramel and dark bread. The flavors seem more palatable when the beer warms up a bit - sip and appreciate.  M: The beer is medium level carbonated, and the aggressive hops scathe the palate. Beer finishes dry.  O: This seasonal IPA is a cause for Celebration (now I'm a hack writer!) indeed. It's more hoppy than Torpedo, Sierra Nevada's year round IPA, but some claim that this IPA can even be AGED! So if you want a sweeter IPA, I'd experiment with that. But for me, it's all about the first hops of the growing season: the fresher the better!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CraftBeerTastic,4.32,"Ba Review #89 Served On: 11/19/2011 Glassware: Pint Glass Labeled ABV: 6.8% Date/ Code: 2011 Release  What better way to kick off the winter season than with a Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. Found a 12 pack of the 2011 release at my usual beer store for $13.99!  Look: It poured a hazy organish copper with a finger of off-white fluffy head. There was a slow but constant stream of carbonation bubbles rising.  Smell: Fresh cut pine tree with some ripe grapefruit and a super clean citrus that is common with Sierra Nevada. The aroma was just as I remembered it from last year’s release.  Taste: First was a strong ripe grapefruit and pine note that quickly faded into a nice bitter middle. The finish was somewhat dry with a malty bread note blended with the hop bitterness and spice. This is a very complex – but balanced IPA.  I’m not going to lie; I have always loved this beer. Think of this one as a Torpedo with a little less ABV and more balance with higher drinkability. I do remember some of last year’s batch having a little more bitterness and not quite as much of the maltiness. Regardless, yet another great seasonal from SN.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Humulus85,4.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Darkness snifter.  Towering, 3-finger head, off-white. Outstanding retention and heavy, sticky lacing. Wow. It's a kind of deep honey color, and a slightly hazy. Damn fine looking brew.  Citrus, some grass, and a bit of carmel malt in the nose. Crisp and clean smelling.  Like the nose, it leads with hops. Citrus, mainly lemon zest, and maybe a touch of mint. Great caramel malt backing. Very well balanced.  Super crisp and super clean. Moderately dry throughout. Great carbonation, and a medium body. Super drinkable for a slightly higher ABV IPA.  Overall this is a great seasonal IPA from one of the original American craft breweries. Super well balanced with a crisp and clean hop profile. Recommended to any fan of IPAs. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,orangesol,4.02,"Served on-tap at Al's of Hampden into a nonic pint.  A - Pours deep copper orange with a one finger tall white head leaving small streaks of lace down the glass.  S - Smells of sweet caramel malt, pine resin, lightly toasted bread, and citric hops. The hops and malt are well balanced, neither really overpowering the other.  T - Starts off with a nice dose of citric hop bitterness quickly giving way to a mix of sweet caramel malts, fresh baked bread, and some sticky pine resin. It is fairly well balanced but the sweetness is beginning to creep up. The finish is a mix of light sweetness and bitterness, lingering on the pallet for some time.  M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Smooth, slightly sticky, feel that makes it ever so easy to drink.  O - This one remains one of my go to fall beers. The balance of sweetness to bitterness is spot on and it goes down easy. One of the rare IPA's that gets better with age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Nuke77,4,Served in a pint glass the brew pours an amber color that just looks like fall. A good head is formed when poured down the center of the glass. The nose is malty. The mouthfeel is light but satisfying. Good intergration of both hops and malt with a bit of bitterness on the finish.

140,1904,kevanb,4.35,"2011 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale  One of my seasonal favorites, and one I always look forward to. It pours a really nice amber color with a nice big soft billowy head on top, looks like christmas spices. The nose has nice wet fresh hops with those christmas spices with a touch of malt at the end that links everything together. Nice bitter hops, pine flavors with holiday spicing and a firm but approachable malt backbone. Nice body, not too full but not thin by any means, it's nice and wet from the fresh hops at the start, but has a nice dry finish.  Verdict: A true holiday ale from California, nicely spiced but hop forward and pleasant. Not a hop monster, but a really well balanced ale that embodies the holidays, but stays true to the west coast style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Rschis16,4.33,"Perfectly clear and vibrant amber colored beer with tons of visible carbonation from the bottom. Huge sticky two finger off-white head on top that leaves a bunch of lacing as it dissapates. Excellent retention as it takes forever to dissapate. Just a gorgeous beer. The aroma is decievingly nice as soft earthy hop tones come up. Lots of citrus and resin from the hops as well. A big bready maltiness follows it all up and rounds it out.  Bready and almost sweet malt is the first flavor to come out, as well as set the baseline for the piney, citrusy and resiny hops to play around on the palate. The hops are sneaky, as they leave their piney and citrus tastes to be detected first, but leave the bitterness until the finish and the linger. I believe this is where the malts intervene, bringing an superb balance to some very strong hop flavors. The bitterness in the back is sharp and resiny and begs for another sip as it lingers on way into the aftertaste. It also lends a dryness in the end to a pretty creamy and smooth frontside. Through it all is the slightest twinge of booze, felt in the tingle of the tongue.  This is a beer that I have looked forward to having again since last year, the first time I had it. This beer is great due to the taste obviously, but also the price point and it is available everywhere this time of year. Classic beer and one to enjoy this season as well as next.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CBlack85,4.12,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a balloon glass  Pours a medium copper color with orangish highlights. A fairly aggressive pour produced a huge off white head that recedes slowly, leaving behind sheets of sticky lacing.  The aroma is huge. The big hoppy aroma is piney and resinous, with lots of grapefruit, and just a hint of orange zest. If you can get past the hops you will find a nice sweet malty base, with some slightly bready notes.  The flavor follows the nose quite closely. There is a bit of bitterness right up front with huge amounts of grapefruit and piney hop goodness. There is just the slightest bit of lingering bitterness in the finish. The malt profile is bready and sweet, just big enough to provide balance. Medium body and moderately carbonated, with a slightly dry finish.

140,1904,tlazaroff,3.9,"A: The head on this beer is unreal! It just clings to the glass like velcro and doesn't want to let go, lacing is nice. The liquor itself is almost a rust-like mix of brown and red hues, carbonation bubbles are present, and it isn't completely clear, but almost clear.  S: Mmm, this smells nice. It has a strong malt aroma reminiscent of caramel and toffee that is still hot and cooking! There is a light citrus hop aroma which follows it up for a crisp finish.  T: More hops are present in the flavor than the aroma. First thing you get is a sweetness that is cut through by a sharp bitterness that finishes in resiny hop flavor.  M: Big levels of carbonation on this one, it has that distinctive carbonation bite character. Medium body and a bit dry on the finish.  D: Despite it's alcohol, it's quite drinkable.

Lots of film on the sides as well.  Smelled of citrus, piney hops. Very hoppy. There also seemed to be some caramel malts in there.  First taste was red, roasty malts, followed by a sudden kick of citrus hops. Pine comes in hard. Bitter finish on the tongue.  Medium body. Oily texture. Lively (moderate) carbonation. Slighty bitter finish.  A decent beer overall, but I thought it was going to be a lot better, especially after the smell. The nose was the best part.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MasterSki,4.3,"Picked this up at Binny's. Served in a Pisgah pint glass. 2011 edition (obviously).  A - A finger-plus of white foam settles to a thick cap that features excellent retention and plenty of sticky lacework. Lightly hazed gold-amber body with visible streams of bubble.  S - As soon as I popped the cap the room filled with fresh tangerines and grapefruit rinds. In the background is a sugar cookie and icing sugar malt backdrop. There's a bit of festive pine for good measure, and the faintest soapy Cascade note.  T - The taste doesn't quite have the same punch, but it's a delicious mix of clementines and sugary pie crust malts. There's some medium-low bitterness, but this actually finishes surprisingly clean with a bit of lingering orange flavor.  M - Extremely resinous, with tons of lingering hop oils. Medium-light body, with moderate-to-low carbonation. Dry finish, with the aforementioned enamel-coating sensations. Never would have guessed this was 6.8%.  D - This year's celebration is great. Shame on anyone who questions the hoppiness this year. I remember being lukewarm on some previous iterations, but this one is a real winner.

Smells: a pine and citrus hop that has a floral spice hint.  Tastes: a floral and well carbonated IPA. there is a pine and spice that is the backbone with a balance with the citrus characteristics that I adore.  Mouthfeel: for being close to a double I really think this ale a super flavorful over being hot on the burn. the carbonation is quite assertive which probably helps with that.  Overall: I love this brew. I want to check back next year bacause for the past three years this has been my favorite seasonal by SN. Great job again Sierra Nevada a home run this year too.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Spicy citric hop nose. Faint caramel sweetness in the background, but most all hops on the nose. As one would expect with a winter warmer.  Flavor starts with an big bitterness bite. Hop profile follows the nose. Peppery spiciness. Citric notes. Lemon rinds and such. Minimal sweetness while still having a solid, full body. Plenty of spices. Flavor will surely improve with age.

140,1904,aorloski,4,"Appearance - Pours a very deep brown, bordering on amber. Big fluffy 2 finger head that is off-white in color. Lots of lacing on this one. Beautiful  Smell - Different than other Sierra Nevada offerings. It is lacking in that west coast juicy hop profile and more on the piney notes. A touch of breadyness in the background.  Taste - Bitterness up front, malts in the back. Again, different hop profile than a normal SN beer, say, torpedo. Less juicy and more piney. I appreciate the malt kiss in the back of this one to hold it all together. Very tasty though.  Mouthfeel - Silky and good carbonation  Overall - I tend to drink out of season, i love IPAs in the winter and i love RIS in summer. This is a great go-to winter IPA, the color is great and enticing and the hops are more bitter than juicy, something i enjoy around these times.

Pale malts, piney hops, a touch of citric hops, and a bit of spice round this IPA off nicely. Bittering bite in the back, and pretty smooth body here.

T: Floral hop (almost minty) bouquet mixing with sweet caramel and full bready malt. Citrus hops take a bite right as you swallow, followed by a residual pine hop finish. Slightly dry, and delicious.  M: Medium-full body, smooth and creamy, lower carbonation, dry finish.

The head takes the form of a beautifully rich honeycombed cloud as it settles, eventually fading into a subtle topcoat. Nice lacing that has serious staying power.  S: The smell is nostalgic, as Celebration was one of the first seasonals I've ever had, and I haven't had it since, until now. Some citrus and piney hop notes but they only outline the central floral bouquet that is very well-rounded. It has a subtle nose.  T: The taste is subtle as well, compared to other AIPAs, but it's great for the season. No single note stands out, but rather they all come together to make this a harmonious, solid and very drinkable ale. An extremely fresh hop character is pervasive on the backend.  M: Well balanced. Syrupy on the frontend, but really levels off into a mild and smooth feel. Not much carb.  I'm not as crazy about Celebration as others are, but it's still a solid brew for the winter season and I hope it remains a staple.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Some bread and caramel. 4/5  Taste - Very nice. I would like to use the word ""balanced"" but I think this is much more hop forward than malt forward. Especially for a winter seasonal. All of that is damn fine with me! The piney, earthy hops fill your mouth and the malt tries to calm them down. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel- Very good. The mouthfeel gets a little bigger at the end and when it warms a bit. 4.5/5  Overall- Very good beer. I get multiple 6pks every year. This year stands out to me, but I can't tell you why.

140,1904,falloutsnow,4.36,"Bottle from Hyvee in Omaha, NE. No freshness date on bottle other than '2011' as year. Poured into a standard US pint glass.  Pours a &gt;2cm head of cream-colored foam made up of fairly small bubbles. This gives the head a very dense, pillowy appeal to it. Head descends gradually, but never fading completely (remains a 0.5cm cap on the body) leaving enormous amounts of lacing. Body is orange amber in color, slightly hazy  Aroma is notably hoppy, pulling in strong pine and juniper, along with noticeable grapefruit and orange. Slightly sweet and cracker-like from malt, but appropriately overshadowed by hops. Good, but not exceptional.  Taste opens with Interesting combination of hop flavors, ranging from a burnt or toasted hop, pine, juniper, to very light grapefruit and orange citrus. Some hop bitterness, but nothing too crushing. Malt backbone is never too far away, giving off adequate caramel sweetness for balance. Aftertaste of mild pine resin and hop bitterness. Fairly complex and enjoyable.  Beer is medium-bodied with enough carbonation to foam this up a bit on the palate. Feels somewhat creamy on the palate. Dry finish, slightly astringent.  An extremely tempered and pleasing IPA. The pine hop flavors seem appropriate for the time of year, though this would be excellent at any point one wanted a very hop-forward beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ChadQuest,2.53,"Bottle says 2011, so i have to assume that its this fresh batch to get it out before the holidays. Pour is a dark amber color, some bubbles and thin lacing around, dark for an IPA, but i guess that is what a holiday ipa is i assume. Aroma is less aromatic then i expected, does not jump out at you, and has some standard C hop aromas amid some biscuit. less then exciting, sub par for an ipa. Flavors are more citrus, the carbonation makes it brighter, and the obligatory pine is noted, more balanced then other IPAs, i would say this is more balanced then most ""east coast"" ipas, really borders the Pale Ale territory, which is what i always thought this beer was.  I remember liking this beer more when i was just getting into craft, either my palate has matured past C hops as a preferance or i got a lame batch.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T - Grapefruit and pine from the standard centennial/cascade hops combo open (typical Sierra Nevada) and stay throughout its entirety. Bitter from open to finish, with some caramel malt buried somewhere under there. Completely imbalanced (even with the style in mind).  M - Coarse on the open, but smooth and wet finish. Light bodied.  D - I'm not a fan of this one at all. It's a mediocre beer at best. Sierra Nevada is capable of far more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: an obviously apparent american hop character. bubblegum and grapefruit. the malt is there too. a sort of caramel sweetness that plays nicely with the hop aromas.  T: terrifically floral and citrus while having a solid amount of bitterness as well. this one is mostly all about the hops. while tasty i wouldnt hate a bit stronger of grain flavor.  M: a little more than moderate carbonation on a medium body. works well.  D: another great hoppy brew from SN. shame this only comes out during the winter, but it does add to the craze and makes it that much more exciting when it does finally hit the shelves.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,WMEugene,5,"50th review!  A - Pours a rich copper/amber color with a thick bubbly head and fantastic lacing.  S - Strong hops smell; nice blend of citrus and pine notes. Just a tinge of caramel sweetness.  T - Rich hop flavor, just a tinge of hoppy bitterness. Both citrus and pine flavors are present. Malt flavors - particularly caramel malts - are present and provide a rich backbone for the hops flavors to work off. Very fresh tasting. A fantastic blend of flavors.  M - Medium bodied, a little creamier and smoother than your average IPA. Nice aftertaste - great hoppy finish.  O - Sierra Nevada's Celebration is the best ""wide release"" IPA out there. It's an amazingly well-done IPA with just a bit more malt presence than your run of the mill IPA. I'm now wishing I'd bought a 12-pack or case instead of the 6-pack.

Bubbles can be seen dancing to the top in a rapid fashion.  Earthy hops on the nose, with notes of pine and resin. A touch of caramel and bread sweetness behind that.  Opens with a nice juicy, fresh earthy hop flavor similar to pine. Then quickly moves into a pale malt and caramel sweetness. A touch of spicyness that gives me the impression that there could be some rye in this but it is most likely due to the hop variety they used.  Soft and some what thin for the style, with a touch of drying. A little more carbonation than I prefer in my pale ales.  Good earthy hop flavors take the focus in this highly available fresh hop beer. A good go to beer in this season when grocery shopping or in a pinch, but not something I would pick over some of the better wet hopped beers. But it's price and availability still make this a good choice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T- Lots of hops, but a good balance with a strong malt presence that doesn't overwhelm but does assert itself. If there was such a think as a christmas IPA this would certainly fit the bill.

Good hop aroma, not too strong though. Taste is great, hops providing most of the flavor. Aggressive pine hops with some grapefruit character, with malt sweetness balance at the end. Hop character lingers afterwards. Well carbonated and has a good body. Creamy feel that is very drinkable. This beer is beyond drinkable, each sip makes me want more.

Piny hop notes on the nose first, citrus hops follow up, brown sugar and caramel notes fill the back bone on this beer. Smells the way a west coast IPA should. Aspriny bitterness on the tongue first, the piny hop presence resinates around the mouth. Medium on the feel, not too intense but def bold, bitter and dry with a boozy red wine finish.

S- Pine needles and grapefruit. Not much malt sweetness here.  T- Taste matches the smell. Hops crush hard from start to finish. Pine and grapefruit are the dominant taste. A bit of malt tries to flash through in the middle, but is beat back easily by the hops. One the end there's a touch of white pepper there when the bitterness really kicks in, and the dry finish says ""you know you want more""  M- Creamy, medium carbonation, dries out the mouth on the finish.

Vigorous pour yields a good head which calms down to a thin ring  Smell is delicious. Sweet, sappy pine aromas with a good malt background lurking in there. it's definitely a California christmas.  The taste is actually pretty mild. Not as hoppy as the aroma lets on, but it's still got a great hop kick, especially in the back of the tongue. Some spicey notes are hidden underneath it all.

There's a think off-white head and good lacing that remains long after the beer is gone. The smell has the appropriate pine needle scent of hops, but it isn't overpowering. Taste wise, this beer really shines. Every sip is a crisp bite of hops.

140,1904,goldennectar,4.35,"I have been looking forward to this since last winter. I had my first SN Celebration about a year ago and it is the beer that opened my world to more hopped up beers.  Poured from 12 oz.bottle into pint glass.  Appearance: Nice thick white head & beautiful amber color  Smell: Hops & Pine - Extremely fragrant and fresh. Slight hint of citrus  Taste: Hops Malt Citrus Balanced & Fresh Full of flavor  Mouthfeel: Crisp & fresh not overly heavy, just about right for me. Nice dry finish  Overall: 2011 is as enjoyable as the 2010 was for me. Still one of the top 10 beers I have tried.  On a side note: I own a beer drive thru and I set a six pack of 2010 in a dark corner of the cooler back last year to taste along side the 2011.  The 2010 has mellowed quite a bit and the hops is not so much in your face as the fresh product but still full of flavour and pours a very similar head as the fresh 2011. I still like it! I think will set at least 2 cases back later this winter for next year to sell.

This one leaves great sheets of pillowy lace. The body is the color of orange rind with amber highlights.  Smell- The hop notes are estery and have a touch of floral to them. There is some slight citrus backed up by a sweet caramel malt. It smells great, but it is a little too subdued.  Taste- The hop bitterness is really great on this one and lasts throughout the drink. There is some sweeter biscuit malt accompanied with citrus and grassy hop flavors. It is a refreshing IPA.  Mouth feel- This one borders on a light and medium body. It certainly is not the creamiest IPA out there by any stretch of the imagination.  Overall- This is a good IPA that I would recommend to anyone. The main thing to adjust would be the mouth feel by fixing the carbonation up, also get those great hop notes to really show up on the palate.  The malt character is nice, but getting more of that floral hop in the flavor, for instance, would only help this IPA's score.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Good lacing on the side of my glass. The nose is mainly pine, hops, grapefruit and malt. It's nice, and farily balanced. Taste is the same profile. It could use a little more hops in my opinion, just a little weak on that aspect. A little more hops and the taste would definitely get bumped up. Feel is crisp, medium bodied, and hoppy/carbonated- probably the best aspect of this beer. Overall, a very solid brew! Cheers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,fmccormi,4.31,"On tap into a 20oz nonic pint at the Blue Tusk in Syracuse, NY.  Appearance (4.5): There’s a thin, off-white head falling to a haze that leaves some fuzz on the surface of the body, which is a deep copper and more or less clear. Very attractive.  Smell (3.5): Lightly toasted malts, some grapefruit and some pine. I’d like some more in the nose, but it’s pretty good stuff regardless.  Taste (4.5): PINE + DANK. Some mild caramel sweetness underneath the hop profile, but nothing will undercut the hops here. Toasted and biscuity, with a light caramel component. Hops are lemon, pine, and dank weed. So good, though. The hop profile kind of morphs from the aforementioned combination into a mix of grapefruit and pine. Bitterness cuts through all of it, with a long but mild, pine finish. Yeast? Classic Chico, totally neutral.  Mouthfeel (5.0): Active, fine carbonation—slightly prickly, and on the lighter side of a medium body. This is very, very hard not to drink faster.  Overall (4.5): This is the archetypal fresh hop IPA, in my mind. All beers of this style aim to be something akin to this: even if they’re aiming to be more or less than what this beer is, they’re aiming for something in the region defined by this beer. Absolutely wonderful.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The see-thru of this beer falls somewhere between transparent and translucent. Carbonation fuels the foamy head for several minutes, leaving thin layer once the pour settles in.  Smell: A Lemony-soap bitter aroma dominates the nose. There is also a malty citrus smell at the front.  Taste: This beer is unlike most IPAs I have drank. The taste has a malty-caramel backbone, and the lemon-citrusy bitterness is very balanced. The finish is malty and slightly lemony, but not bitter at all.  Mouthfeel: Sticky medium-body beer with lots of refreshing carbonation.  Overall: The taste was very unexpected and unique for the IPA's I usually drink, which tend to be hop bombs. The malty-balance is not very apparent by the nose, but a pleasant surprise. This is an IPA that the more casual drinker can enjoy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

On the nose there is a nice grapefruit note with an underlying caramel note. In the mouth there is a good deal more malt than I was expecting. This is fresh, but the hops just aren't as present as I would have guessed. The bitterness that the grapefruit-centric nose would seem to indicate simply isn't there in the quantity I expect in a fresh hop ale. That's not to say it's a bad brew, because it isn't, it's just a little too balanced for my taste. The finish has a bit of bitterness, but the caramel malt sticks around together with it. The body is medium and a little sticky to me.  Overall, this is a decent fresh hop beer, but doesn't compare to the Deschutes Hop Trip I had last night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Smakawhat,4.15,"Back for the re-review and checking this out at a time of release. Vintage 2011 poured into a nonic pint glass.  Appearance is not different, still looks great.  Nose is a soft hop green, small brown sugar, and small sweet cloves and nutmeg. Malt angle seems toned down a bit. Sense of cherry fruit.  Taste is a good hop pine, but also a real chili hot sting in the finish. Finishes sweet and malt rich also. Body seems a little rich as well, but nothing too sweet or cloying. Good hop presence on this, much of the brown spices and fruit sense on the nose doesn't come through on the palate as much with the noticeable hop presence that takes over.  Overall much better fresh by far, really enjoying this much more than in the past. A hoppy Christmas beer, enjoying that.  --- 5-18-2011  Poured from the bottle into a nonic pint glass. Vintage 2010. Seems kind of late doesn't it? How is this going to turn out for a beer that comes out in September? Well we shall see I guess.  Out of the bottle a VERY large head is created that is off white, slightly soapy, and has some REAL good retention. Body color is a solid perfect amber just barely getting into red. Some small carbonation from the bottom and some slight opaqueness. This looks real good! Some sheet like clumps of sticky lacing too.  The first thing on the nose is some sweet cherries and nutmeg. Christmas like spices, and a small hint of pine. No wonder this thing is a seasonal December beer, it feels like Christmas already! Dry spice and pine with a hint of cherry fruit. Just great I could dig this smell anytime.  Taste is lacking. A muted hop and somewhat wet body. I am a bit disappointed from what the nose was hinting at. That pine like sense comes on the finish, but there is no body or malt backbone on this at all. I'll give it some props for displaying some hop finish.  Well it's a little disappointing but I sure would like to try this again when it is in season and I will for sure! I was debating about trying this at such a time but couldn't help myself. No regrets, looking for better things come September! I will try it again for sure!  4.5, 4.5, 3, 3, 3.5",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,BarryMFBurton,4.23,"Sierra Nevada, I’m ready to be blown away – of all the harvest ales, I’ve heard this is the best. It’ll take a lot to beat out Founders, though…  Brewed a month-and-a-half ago (according to the batch code, this was bottled on September 25, 2011).  A: Classic, gorgeous IPA presence: the body is a shining burnt-orange, almost crystal clear. Something unusual, though, is that there looks to be some sediment in there, possibly whole-hop residue (here’s hoping). At any rate, they ride lazily around the swift stream of rising bubbles in the center of my glass, adding a unique haze. And then there’s that Sierra Nevada head: a thick off-white cream that leaves textbook lacing all over the glass. Great retention, thick foam, rich-looking body – doesn’t get any better than this.  S: Odd; the hops aren’t exploding off the nose as I expected. Still, they’re pungent, sporting an incredible kick of cherry/sour-apple candy, lemon juice, pine. I’m digging the grain undercarriage, as well; earthy aromas of lightly toasted malt and crisp wheats. There’s even a hint of autumn spices, rose, and herbs. It’s not what I was expecting, but still nice; the scents are quite segregated.  T: If hop-bread existed, this would be its bottled form; very tasty. Instead of being a messy hop-bomb, this one starts with a lovable bread presence, smoothing out with just enough sour/bitter intensity to remind me of rye (my favorite). It really is stunning how bready it is (an unexpected treat, really), and I love how it reminds me of the true soul of an IPA as a rustic, farm-fresh bitter. With the good, there’s the bad, though, because the first taste before that bread takes over is an odd, buttery lemon-grain taste. Fortunately, there’s more than enough in this palate to distract, such as those ever-important IPA bitters. Overall, I’d describe them as earthy and salty-sweet, but with just a mild dryness; all the hop flavor, with just a hint of the crazy sting. The aftertaste is dry and grainy, slightly herbal (like green tea), and with a light mineral water taste – what a great British feel. Now this is a superb incarnation of an IPA palate; excellent.  M: Creamy and mouth-coating for the breads, prickly for the hops – an effective combination. Sometimes it feels like a nice English bitter, sometimes like a good ol’ American IPA. Man, even the mouthfeel is complex and unexpected!  O: What a beer; this truly is the best harvest beer I’ve had. Complexity, bitterness, and a great range of textures make this beer feel truly alive. One of the best IPAs I’ve had in a long time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: The beer has a strong hop taste with a little bit of malt. The hops linger on the tongue and just are amazing.  M: The beer has a good amount of carbonation and a strong amount of crispness. Not bad, but not the best IPA mouthfeel.  O: This is my favorite seasonal from Sierra Nevada. I just dont get why this beer is so good. It is like a better version of Torpedo.

Spices such as nutmeg and cinnamon on the nose  The taste is nice and citric with a good grassy character. Grapefruit, tea and grass. The hops really brighten up the palate. It is extremely well balanced blend of smoothing malts and lightly bittering hops. The malts are both doughy and candied. Finishes bitter and citric.  Mouthfeel is fuller and flavorful. Almost chewy. The malts and hops interact in unique ways providing a very unique and refreshing drink.  This is worth the once a year release. One of the best fresh hop ale's I've ever had.

Slightly sweet with a white grapefruit presence.  T) Very close to the nose. The finish is grapefruit and citrus peel. The alcohol is hardly detected.  M) Really a pretty full bodied brew. It is well carbonated but not in a fizzy, smashing your palate to smithereens sort of way. It is actually quite smooth, and I find the drinkability to be very high.

140,1904,Trail,4.85,"Oh, this really is exquisite. Reviewing this live, although I'm off to a late start with the glass halfway gone!  Pours a rich, melodious amber body with a frothy, creamy butter-colored head about four fingers thick. Screwed up the pour, but what can you do?  Smells floral, fruity, a little like jam croissant. Really impressed here, there are a lot of different scents here but unlike a lot of complex beers I've had the scents are very integrated, part of a cohesive whole instead of being a sequence of complimentary but disparate components.  Tastes a lot like it smells, but with a deep draw of malty, bready delightfulness. Hops come in briefly at the start and end, bitter and just right. Almost tastes like honey for a moment, and then it's gone. Need another sip.  Mouthfeel is similarly impressive. Carbonated to a crisp but defined perfection, it manages to prickle the tongue without being fizzy and manages not to be fizzy while not being flat. Just a hair more carbonated than a lot of cask ales I've tried.  Overall, this is a great beer. Definitely in my top five, and I'll be sorry when it's gone for the year!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,deadonhisfeet,3.91,"2011 version. Beautiful clear copper color and a huge, chunky head with lacing like snowdrifts. The nose is rather subdued (hard to get with all that foam). It's hoppy and cedary.  Medium body, good, firm feel, and a nice, fresh hoppy taste. Not as dry and bitter as I expected it to be. I get some nice flavors of fresh bread, orange zest, and tea. It's definitely got that hop bite, but it's really smooth, balanced, and easy-drinking. It provides a good ``hop fix'' without wrecking your palate.  Overall, an outstanding fresh hop ale. I can't quite put it on the same level as Founders Harvest Ale or Three Floyds Broo Doo, but it's more widely available, easier on the wallet, and darn tasty to boot. I'll definitely buy this one again next year.  2012 bottling. Still a wonderful seasonal. What strikes me the most is still the balance and drinkability. It has a wonderful, hoppy flavor without being extremely bitter. Beers like this make me proud of the term ``American IPA''.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Hophead717,4.23,"A 12 oz bottle of fresh Celebration poured into a DFH signature glass.  A: One of the more beautiful beers I've seen. Not sure if I just had a lucky pour, or if this was the perfect glass, but this is a beauty. A deep golden brown color, deeper than I expected actually, with a luscious, 1.5 finger, creamy head. The head stayed with this beer all the way through, with excellent lacing on the glass. I couldn't asked for a better looking IPA to be honest.  S: Lots of fresh hops in the nose-a great deal of piney notes as well as grapefruit and orange peel. Hints of sweetness from the malt are also discernible.  T: Upon taking your first sip, really fresh hops land on your tongue. The slightly bitter, piney hops are complemented by a significant, sweet malt backbone with a very well balanced finish. I was afraid the finish would be strongly bitter, but it wasn't at all. Of course, as the brew approaches room temperature, the bitterness level increases, so I'd recommend enjoying Celebration closer to fridge temp at first and experiencing the beer as it warms.  M: A nice and smooth mouthful, with high levels of carbonation. Almost too much carbonation, but it does work quite well.  O: I liked Celebration a great deal; the beer definitely lived up to the hype. I grabbed a six pack at the store today and I probably will head back tomorrow to pick up another...two or three.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ehammond1,4.26,"Bottle (2011)  Liquor Stop San Marcos, CA  Clear, golden, glowing auburn and ruby with a thick, chunky, persistent light khaki head that sticks around for seemingly forever, eventually leaving thick chunks and sheets of foaming lace down the glass. I love the way Sierra Nevada beers look!  A well balanced aroma while still being fairly aggressive. There is a lot of earthy, citrusy, and piney hop character here, as well as a substantial amount of simple brown bread and light caramel character.  The hops lead the way in the flavor, though they are balanced significantly by caramel and bready malts. A relatively high level of bitterness disappears quickly, finishing relatively dry.  Medium to thick mouthfeel with moderate carbonation, though this feels far more velvety and luscious than most any other IPA I've ever drank. This bottle in ways feel like it was drawn from a cask.  A beer I look forward to every late Fall/winter. It's always better than I remember it being, a tough feat for any beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,pmlondrigan,3.88,"Celebration, this years is tasty. Translucent and deep amber in color with belgian (well not in this case) lacing cascading around my tulip. Fair head retention. The aroma, well it is pine atop citrus with caramel cent underneath. Fairly tasty, nice hop presence, pine, resin, citrus married to a more malty frame then I usually look for. Crystal malt adds a bit of sweetness to combat the bittering hops. Its is a well balanced beer with a bitter finish, clean, and well bodied. I'd buy this beer again, it is a nice tasting ipa that you don't have to over think. It is not overly complex, it is just an ipa that you drink and don't think too much about.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tobelerone,3.96,"This beer features nearly an inch of frothy off-white that has excellent retention. Lacing is patchy but sticky. Color is a hazy dark gold/orange hue. Looks very nice!  Nicely hoppy but not overly intense aroma. Touches of citrus and pine backed up by a subtle malt undertone. Not the most aromatic IPA I've come across but certainly not bad.  Taste is quite bitter without a lot of the citrusy notes detected in the aroma. Some herbal flavors present, slightly grassy, a little maltiness underneath. Not really getting much of the sweetness mentioned in other reviews. I know this is a fresh bottle but the hops are mostly just bitter and resiny without a ton of other flavor qualities. Maybe some citrus peels in here too, a hint of grapefruit. Kind of reaching a bit.  Very nice mouthfeel, crisp and refreshing, with medium body and a lingering but not overly bitter finish. This may actually be the best part of this beer as you can pick up more subtleties of flavor as it fades in your mouth. The malt comes out a bit more here, with vaguely medicinal notes and the merest hint of spice. Alcohol begins to warm you as you work your way through the glass.  I liked this beer but found it maybe a little bit one-note for my tastes. I love the hoppiness, appearance, and finish but wish there were a little bit more vivid flavors besides the overall bitterness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - Piney hops, resin, caramel, molasses, nectar.  T - Follows the nose. Great piney hop profile on this one; just a hint of malt to round things out.  M - Moderate carbonation. Nice warming sensation from the alcohol, which is appropriate for a winter seasonal. Rich and medium-bodied.  O - Considering the price/quality ratio, this beer is off the charts (got a 12pk fresh for $11). Quality brew, highly recommended for hop-heads.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

This beer has a large tan head that stick around until you finish. It treats your taste buds to a piney citrus flavor and a medium mouth feel and goes down extremely easy for tan IPA.

S: Citrus and pine, though more subtle than I expected from a fresh hop ale.  T: Caramel with vanilla replaced quickly by hoppy bitterness; spicy, pine resin lingers.  M: Medium bodied, medium carbonation, creamy and very smooth. Pleasant, dry finish.  O: Highly anticipated, this ale does deliver. Seems less ""fresh"" and ""green"" than other wet hop ales I've tried, though I believe SN defines ""fresh"" differently than some other brewers. Hops are well integrated. Very solid overall.

140,1904,zeledonia,3.73,"2011 vintage, bottled 29 Sep 2011. Not quite as fresh as I'd like, but it took some time to get here. Just hit shelves about a week ago, IIRC.  Pours a deep, slightly orange amber. Mostly clear, not quite see-through, but I can see in enough to notice numerous bubble streams. Orangey-cream head, 1.5 fingers, good retention and lacing.  Smell is a burst of fresh hops. Quite piney, with a bit of citrus (mostly grapefruit) behind that. Malt base feels fairly weak - I can detect it, but barely.  Taste is a whack of bitter - hits hard and is gone quickly. I don't pick up much else in it. A bit of malts filling in. But the lighter hop flavors are totally covered by that sharp, persistent bitterness.  Medium-bodied, medium-high carbonation. Fairly sticky. Long finish; that hop bitterness just holds on forever.  Liked the look and the smell, but not impressed by the taste. I prefer more balanced IPAs, or ones that showcase more of the positive hop flavors. This one is a bitter-bomb, with little supporting or accenting it. Becomes less so as it warms up - more balanced, with less sharpness and the malts coming through more. Okay, but not my favorite.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GlassFreeek,4.05,"Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a medium sized tulip glass.  A: Nice dark orange looking IPA. A little darker and richer looking than your average IPA. Off white, creamy looking head. Small-medium sized bubbles. Has a good amount of retention.  S: Nice citrus/piney hop aroma coming off of this one. A little bread sweetness in there as well.  T: Amazingly drinkable. You can put these down pretty easily but in a very enjoyable way. For the price, you can't really beat this IPA. This is a winner in my book. Slight bitterness but a good sweet malt backbone to make it very balanced and slam-a-ble.  MF: Really refreshing, the perfect amount of bitterness to help cleanse the pallet. Light-Medium body, IMO.  O: This is unbeatable for the availability and price. I'd pick this up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SeaOfShells,4.43,"12 oz. into Duvel Tulip  A: A beautiful red/orange body resting underneath a fluffy, tight bubbled eggshell head. The beers leaves some nice lacing along the side of the glass. Carbonation streams up the glass. Great looking beer.  S: Oh man, sweet bready malts underneath a clean piney hop scent. It smells....almost medicinal? Kind of like a drug store. It's really nice, however.  T: Mild bitterness up front, which yields to sweet biscuity malts on the swallow. Finishes moderately sweet and moderately dry. Hops stick around well after the beer has been swallowed. Exceptional taste. Very clean and refreshing. We have a winner.  M: Feels nice in the mouth, with a decent amount of bubbly carbonation. A coating effect takes place, and the beer lingers long after you take it down.  O: Amazing. This years batch is just as good, if not better, than last years. I look forward to it every year, and this year does not disappoint. This beer is dangerously drinkable. Just fantastic stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bobhits,4.36,"There are a few beers every year I buy and just can't put my thoughts down on. This is certainly one of them.  The perfect sticky creamy lace coating head you'll see. A nice light amber color that's dense from I would assume bottle conditioning. Light shines through no problem, but you can't see through it.  Sharp fresh citrus hops as expected. They bite the nose and make you beg for me.  The hops here bite, they linger, they're citrus with a hint of pine. This beer has an interesting spicy kick at the end, not sure where it comes from but it keeps this one on the very aggressive and dry side. The malt is here but the hops just obliterate it.  I'll have another...need I say more?  This one is a bit aggressive and the dryness and the bite to it will turn people away who don't enjoy that. I however am not one of those people! If you don't like the aggressive bite a month or two will leave a still wonderful beer with more malt standing out. I can vouch that this isn't a bad IPA after a bit of age hits it. I'd still drink early!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,DeltaGolfSierra,4.48,"Clear amber color beneath a huge billowy head. Traces of the head last through the entire glass, and leave lots of lacing. Gorgeous. The aroma of grapefruit and pear with a bit of freshly baked bread makes some pleasing sniffs. The taste is wonderfully balanced.

S: Earthy, resinous pine, a little mango also.  T: Mellow pine, powdery biscuit underneath. Gentle pine bitterness on the finish. Earthiness from the smell carries over into the flavor, but no mango here. Finish becomes spicy over time-- cinnamon?  M: Light, fluffy and creamy, a bit astringent.

T - Floral/piney hops hit you with some citrus/orange notes leaving a slight bitterness in your mouth that is quite tasty. There is a bit of malt in there but the delicious hops are the stars.  M - Medium body beer with moderate carbonation, very nice consistency for this type of beer.  O - Even though SN is a big company they still make great beers.

Smells wet hopped, but in the best way. As usual, Sierra Nevada shows us how to use piney hops. Nice bitering hops in the background.  It definitely feels like a West Coast IPA. Nice use bitter, piney American hops. Bittering hops give it an edge, which can be overlooked in some IPAs. The taste focuses more toward the bittering hops, and less on aroma hops, which is the only downfall of this beer.  Aftertaste feels bitter and hoppy (so I guess it feels like an IPA).

M: The best thing about this beer to me is the nice creamy thick mouthfeel. Nice carbonation and zingy zest.  O: Overall, this beer is slightly plain, but very refreshing and drinkable.

M: awesome smoothness until the moment the carbonation hits, then it's crisp to the end. Medium body and medium carbonation.  O: very good beer, and at $9 for a 6-pack I'll be sure to grab it again some time. Just have to be careful that it's not too old. I hate that they release it so early.

Spicy, pine, and citrus hop flavors fill the mouth. A bit of caramel comes through, but the hops pick up again and carry it to a lingering bitter finish.  Medium bodied and quite drinkable with medium carbonation.  There's a reason this beer is looked forward every year by hop heads.

140,1904,vandemonian,4.06,"This bottle Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale was around 9 months old, so a lot of the hops would have faded. I wanted to try it and this was all that was available. It's still a quality beer, but the flavours are more subtle than intended. I'll try to try a fresh bottle at Christmas and update this!  A: Orange colour and a 2 cm head that lasts. 5  S: Piney hops over a nice malty base. Some faded fruit notes. 4  T: Malty and slightly sweet with some notes of fruit (pear? weird). Quite nice. 4  M: Foamy. 4  O: 4  EDIT: I had a fresh bottle and the hoppy flavour and bitterness were much stronger. Still, far from my favourite IPA. Bitter grass flavour.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,steve8robin,4.09,"I have a 2005 and 2006 bottle to try. I've heard a lot about this brew. 12oz bottle, 2005...  A: A nice deep red / brown with a small 1/4 inch off white head that fades very quickly to a small lace atop the brew. Bubbles looked medium. Decent.  S: Smells of a super sweet malt quickly blended with a nice citrus hop. A mild caramel in the middle with some, almost, cranberry scents. Very good.  T: A watery mild roastiness upfront quickly followed by a mild earthy / bitter citrus hop in the middle and a nice bready malt on the backend. Great balance to this brew. Good.  M: Light body with a light carbonation. A dry malty finish. Good.  O: All in all, this is a good beer that I feel like could be duplicated as a homebrew. It almost has a homebrew-type taste to it. Definitely try if you like a well balanced beer. If you're looking for this to be an IPA, you may be disappointed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,OBeerMeGreatOne,4.33,"Poured from a Winter 2010 bottle into a pint. I've had them as old as 2 1/2 years (and though that one showed a tad too much age) and I must say that this is one of the few hop forward beers that maintains well with age.  Looks like it maintained the ability to create an amazing head with sick lacing. Other then that, nice orange/amber hue.  Caramel, citrus, pale malts and pine show up, a hint of earthy mint in the finish.  The taste still has a strong citrus bite up front, more pale and les caramel malt, mint, pine and slight mineral finish. More balanced than a fresh one. Slightly resiny in the mouth.  Great fresh, great nine months old, great after a year. If you haven't had one... Pbbbttt.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Lauthaha,4.58,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a beer taster.  Appearance: Beer is a mostly-clear deep golden hue with active carbonation visible through the glass. Head is super frothy and rich-looking, and dimples down beautifully over the course of several minutes. Great retention.  Smell: Bright, crisp citrus zest on top of some piney hops. Some caramel-type malt in the background. Tantalizing.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The malt lays down a nice thick base right off the bat. Carbonation creates a cool lava flow on the tongue, and hops begin to strike like lightning bolts on a placid lake. Very bitter, piney; some spicy notes thrown in for good measure. Finish is crisp and dry, and leaves you wanting more. A little on the bitter side for me (I'd like to see a little more citrus or malt sweetness), but an amazing brew, indisputably.  Overall: Wow. Definitely worth the $2.00 price tag! Sierra Nevada has impressed me again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jondeelee,4.2,"The 2010 version of Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale is a ""Fresh Hop Ale,"" featuring ""the first hops of the growing season."" To the nose, this translates to slow, rolling waves of hops, bringing grapefruit, pine, and citrus notes. a lovely yeasty bread dough aroma lingers in the background, complete with brown sugars and apricot fruit esters.  On the tongue, the beer is immediately hoppy bitter, bringing in full force the grapefruit and pine notes from the nose. Perhaps because of the freshness of the hops--first off the plant--there is an extra hint of spiciness and wildness to the brew: a lemon-peppery citrus zest that infuses the bitterness. Behind these, and moderately difficult to locate, given the hops, lies a layer of malts, complete with brown sugars, apricots, and pecans. The hops dominate the mouthful, however, and continue into the aftertaste, which is almost exclusively hops, and divebombs the tastebuds for quite a while. Mouthfeel is medium, and carbonation is medium-high.  Overall, this is good beer, though its relation to the Holiday season should be noted as going little beyond the festive label: there are no Christmas spices in here, no fancy gingerbread or shortbread ingredients. Instead, there's just malts and hops, hops, hops. IPA lovers should take note of this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Light citrus and some hops.  Taste-Got alot of unique flavors in this. Besides the heavy caramel malts and citrusy hops I got some cocoa nibs, pear, green apple.

Aroma is that of toasted sweet bread, deep floral hops and perhaps a touch of cinnamon. Mouthfeel is a very hop forward one with no shame in slamming the palate with earthy pine and herbal hops riding very nicely on a robust malt base. The finish leaves a favorably bitter imprint on the palate and is quite refreshing (much enjoyed on this humid day) despite its very wintery warming character.

Smells nice and hoppy. Very piney sweet smelling. The aroma is a bit shallow beyond the the sweet malt and piney hops, not bad, just simple. The flavor is quite bitter, coats the mouth with the bitterness. Very grapefruity, bitter pith, but also sweet ruby-red grapefruit flesh. This beer is definitely all about the hops. A faint toastiness develops in the long finish. The mouthfeel is fine, a bit coating, the bitterness definitely lingers as a physical sensation, not quite astringent, the carbonation is on point.

140,1904,Zimbo,4.65,2010 Best Before 15/10/11  Orangy brown with some super rocky head this beer sure looks the part but its the mouthfeel which just steals the show. It is ever so spritzy yet strong and firm. The long strong bitterness is pretty dry with bags of finesse and leaves a fine coat of lingerng bitterness in the mouth. Just superb how that bitterness just arrives as it hits the back of the throat. Super sticky head is left all over the empty glass. Not at all aggressive but neither could you ever call effeminate. Just love the way that Sierra Nevada's beers all display some house character but are also all so unique.

This beer pours out as a really nice looking Christmasy red color with a tan head on top that settles pretty quickly. The aroma is mostly hops which I like, it makes me want to dive right into this beer. The other aromas are subtle enough that they are almost nonexistent in this one. There is a little bit of spiciness coming through in the nose as well. The taste is just hoppy, I guess there are some malt flavors in the far background of this beer but mostly all hops here.

Some light lacing as the head drops to a half finger collar around the edge of the glass. A little carbonation can be seen at the edge of the glass, but it's hard to see through the haze.  Hops are slightly faded but still there, mainly pine, floral hops, with a dark caramel and candied orange rind sweetness.  Taking a sip, bitter hops right away, pine, floral orange blossoms, and earthy. Some sweetness from the malts midtongue softens the bitterness a bit, caramel and dark breads. Light lingering floral hops on the tongue after you swallow.  Light to medium bodied and very well carbonated with ample soft bubbles easing the flavors onto your tongue.

At least four fingers, and it never really dissipates, leaving sheets of nice lacing. Well carbonated, too. Beautiful in every aspect...  Nice, fresh hop aromas greet you straight away. That must be the fresh hops they add. Atypical for SN in that it's not an overly malty aroma. Very subdued, actually.  Flavor is big and complex. Intro is bitter in a hoppy way, and the whole ale stays very hoppy thorughout. Not like typical big Lefty IPAs, though. The hops are really established and prevalent, but don't overpower you. The malt backbone never really comes to the forefront, but holds the whole together...When the hops start to fall off, and another hop character rears up, malty is still in the back getting you a little sweetness to back it up. Great, flavorful, well-balanced, yet still hop forward. Very nice. Now for the nice: $3.99/24 oz. bottle and 6.8% ABV. Drinkable too...  What I like most: Pretty much everything, but the appearance is top notch.  What I like least: The lower than hoped for ABV in a Winter ale...

I feel its very drinkable like most Sierra products but I also have a slight biased opinion because I love a hoppy beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,iamsemigloss,3.67,"Reviewed on 12/31/10, taken from notes.  Appearance: A large impressive head leading to an amber beverage. Body was clear and the lacing good.  Smell: A hop bomb, complex sharp citrus, herbal and perfume notes, even some pine. Light malts present, toasty and caramel.  Taste: Caramel hits the palate first, leading into the barrage of citrus and a little pine. A warm bitter alcohol kick on the finish. I detected faint hints of dish soap, which honestly was a real distraction...  Mouthfeel: Creamy and drying.  Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer but probably wouldn't buy another. It's my understanding that this beer changes somewhat from year to year, and I liked it enough that I will revisit it next year, for sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,nickd717,4,"Review transcribed from notes taken in February 2009.  Like a holiday IPA, except not so pale. Dark reddish brown with an off-white head.  Aroma is hops, spices, and caramel malt. Smells very nice.  Flavor is rather IPA-like with more caramel maltiness than your typical west coast IPA, and a slight spiced note to go along with big piney west coast hops. Bitterness is too much for some amateurs, but not me of course! I eat it up like Rosie O'Donnell eating an entire cheesecake.  Medium-plus bodied with good hop resins and average carbonation.  What else could you ask for Christmas ? (and don't say a pony - it's NEVER happening!!!)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Luk13,3.36,"Bottle 2008 vintage, consumed 1 year later. Thanks ritzkiss. Beautiful color here, nice hazy red pour.

140,1904,camp0474,4,"Review from 11/24/10  2010 Celebration Ale  A: Pours light orange amber with tan head. Abundant lacing.  S: Skunky moist pine and floral hops. Fresh hoppy smells with sweet malt. Smells somewhat balanced.  T: At first I almost thought it was flavorless, the flavors were very faint and subtle. The fresh hop oils make a gradual appearance and then peak up hard as wet piney flavors. The sweet malt does a good job balancing the heavy hops. Slightly bitter hop lingers.  M: Medium to heavy body, the hop oils weigh this one down. Good carbonation.  D: Pretty drinakble for the fresh hop style. Smells good, tastes good.  Good display of fresh hops. Good for the occasional ""celebration"". I will definitely have more next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,deadliest,4.4,"A: Two fingers of ivory foam leaves a coating of lacing down the walls of the glass as it recedes into a golden hued dark copper body. S: A medley of citrus, pine and flowery hops. The only balance here is among the hops, but I'm good with that. T: Citrus hops take over the hop profile, and the taste is a bit more balanced than the smell with its sweet malts. M: Medium/medium-light body. Crisp finish. D: As good as it gets.  Wish this was year round instead of torpedo :(",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Rhettroactive,4.13,"From bottle to Bruges hybrid glass on 2/16/11  A: Huge three finger head on a good pour. Really sticky lacing remains as the head slowly dissipates. It's resiny and cloudy; it's opaic burnt umber in color.  S: Sweet hops and marshmallow fluff. It's woody and spicy, yet balanced and inviting.  T: Rich hop oil and pine resin. It's not cloying like some within the style. There's a long bitter finish which is mild, balanced and delicious.  M: Creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. It's warming and heavy, just what you want around the holidays.  O: I've had a lot of these this winter, and a I look forward to having a lot more next year too. One of the better values around Christmas time. It's easy to drink, well balanced and just damn tasty.

140,1904,Retsinis,3.95,"Review from notes  A friend had a 2.5 gallon keg of this at his condo for Christmas party.  Poured from the tap into a standard pint glass.  The beer pours a nice, rich amber bronze color that is slightly hazy. Creamy inch or more of head that slowly dissipates, leaving heavy, thick lacing that stick to the sides of the glass.  The aroma's are of fresh hops, with hints of citrus/grapefruit and pine. Not too much on the malts side.  The flavors in the taste are crisp, well balanced, and full of flavors. Ranging from hops, grapefruit/lemon, as well as the pine mirrored in the aroma. Some light spicy wood notes there in the middle, with a great finish.  Mouth feel is sticky, bitter, with a smooth mild finish. Well carbonated, and a nice change during the winter with so many stouts around.  Overall, can easily drink one or two of these, perhaps even more than that, though I tend to jump to different beers in a sitting. The beer has some nice subtle flavors, that meld well with each other, and strike a balance between flavor and a clean finish.  Last time I had this, I was not impressed, though it was in late April (2009) and from a bottle. To me, there is a difference when it's fresh and on tap, and based on my experience, fresh and on tap is my preference.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JMad,4.28,"I poured this from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass...  It looks an orange amber color with a thick frothy white head.  The smell is of grapefruit, sweet caramel malt, and pine with a hint of lemon.  I tasted piney hops, toasted malt, grapefruit, and just a hint of alcohol.  It's not heavy but still full bodied, and sticky but still has a dry finish.  This is definitely one my go to beers, you can't go wrong with this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HOPPYKC,4.03,"Poured into a pint glass. No bottled on or bb date.  I was surprised to find this at a liquor store that is not known for its craft brews.  A- Pours a nice a slightly medium amber to almost golden brown. Not a light wet hopped ale. I love the look of this ale. Opaque, and not easy to see through. Gave a nice inch of head, not all the bubbly, just a nice solid mass of foam.  S- Piney, hoppy, and fruity. A nice floral aroma. A lot of pine resin. Nice nice nice.  T- A bitter explosion. Tastes a lot of the pine and hops. A slight grainy taste that is dry and coats the entire tongue.  M&D- This is a full brew for sure. Feels alot heaver that it actually is. A great IPA in my opinion though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Baraka,4.92,"Pours a beautiful orange with a solid head. The nose is all hops: citrus, pine, resin. Much like the nose, the taste is one of absolute hop domination. This beer is everything that I love about IPAs, incorporating all the wonderful citrus flavors and an unremitting bitterness. One of my absolute favorite beers; it makes the cold weather bearable!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Glibber,4.16,"Beautiful amber color, plenty of bubbles, and a nice 1/2 frothy head that settled down after a few sips. Some decent lacing. Where this beer seperates itself from some other winter beers is that the mouthfeel is superb, crisp and light with some citrus up front and a hop finish. Might be tough to drink to many unless you really like the hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kohoutek,3.88,"This beer is a few months old and I am guessing it is not at its total peak of freshness, but an additional view (next year) will make for an interesting comparison. Back in the 90s we used to order numerous kegs of this for our pub in Portland, OR. This item always quickly sold out and it was a brilliantly received beer.  Appearance is a nice orange/amber, relatively bright beer with large white bubbles and streams of carbonation. The head is nice and it sticks to the glass quite well.  Aromas of fresh hoppy, herbal geranium, floral perfume, some citrus rind (orange) and a biscuit-like cracker. The aroma fades incredibly fast and vigorous swirling is required to refresh it. For the most part the flavors match the described aromas, but the bitterness comes off as somewhat rough and there is a bit of an astringent, grassy quality about the beer. It seems less rich and a bit thin and astringent compared to past years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Chincino,4.02,"This beer poured a reddish/orange color with an beige color head.  Right away you could smell the pine and citrus-the aroma was strong, but not overpowering.

140,1904,Messiahbolical,4.48,"A - Pours a dark, red-tinted copper color with an off-white creamy, fluffy head that sticks around. Lots of lacing on the glass. Looks great in the glass.  S - Lots of hops... pine, floral, citrus... this beer smells like it will be balanced. The smell isn't THAT strong though. Wish it was a bit stronger. Still good though.  T - Mmm... delicious. Right away up front you get that citrus hops kick, backed with a noteworthy honey malt sweetness. Then fades out to a nice, strong pine bitterness that sticks to your tongue but not for too long. One of the most balanced, if not the MOST balanced, IPA I've ever had. It has every taste you look for in a good IPA.  M - Medium bodied but silky smooth on the tongue with a creamy feeling carbonation that rolls on through your mouth to the back of your throat and finishes really clean and feels refreshing going down.  D - It's an IPA, a strong style of beer, so of course it's not going to be the most drinkable beer in the world. This one is pretty damn drinkable though. Doesn't fill you up too much and has a relatively average-to-low ABV% for the style. I can see putting a few of these down in one night. And the bitterness doesn't seem to get old, since it fades away at just the right time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,thenewflesh,4.43,"A: Pours with an admirable head that will stick around for the entire beer if you pour it right. This reddish amber elixir looks almost as great as it tastes  S: Floral, sweet aromas that take the reins of your senses and get you ready for the ride.  T: Definitely something to write home about. A bready, full-bodied IPA that really hits the spot on a cold night. So fresh and tangy that it tastes like biting into a magical beer vegetable.  M: Full, crisp, sudsy deliciousness.  D: I can put back 6 of these in a few hours, which scares me considering the alcohol content. They're just so damn delicious that it's hard to stop...

140,1904,honestdave,4.33,Poured from a 12oz bottle into an ale glass.  A: Copper colored with an awesome full creamy head that stays for at least a full five minutes.  S: Fresh citrus hoppiness. Some piney scent as well.  T: Much like the smell...full hoppy bitterness up front and finishes with a light malty ending. Delicious!  M: Creamy head with the first several sips. Medium bodied - what I would expect from a 6.8% ABV brew.  D: I can easily drink several of these at a time. The alcohol is hidden behind the full fresh hop flavor that characterizes this beer.  Summary: My favorite seasonal beer by far. This beer is readily available in my area and also a reasonably priced 12-pack. So happy that I have been able to have this in the fridge all winter. Just another fantastic beer from the masters at SN.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DAllspaw,4.45,"This has been a staple the last two winters, just haven't bothered to register my notes and drank the last one weeks ago.  It has the expected bitter and creaminess that you expect from a pale ale, but for whatever reason is more pronounced in this beer than others I've tried. For my taste, I wouldn't classify as IPA, it lacks the agressive bitterness and finish, but is nonethless a solid pale ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Definte lightly sweet malty presence here.  Taste: A lightly sweet caramelly malt appears right out of the gates followed by a pleasing level of citric, resinous and grassy hop bitterness. Balance is tipped just a bit toward the hop, for a slightly bitter, but very clean and dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, slightly creamy, slightly dry, with good amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Excellent session beer. They know their IPAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Nice dark amber color, small head that dissipated quickly, generally a decent representation of the style... but the taste left a lot to be desired. Overpowering bitterness, with little else--some nice breadiness and spice hid under there, but it was hard to detect.  I'm really hoping this was just a bad batch since I respect Sierra Nevada's other brews, but every bottle in the six-pack I got was disappointing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

D - Nice solid IPA that I'll get again and again. The ABV is low enough to allow me to drink a few which is always a huge plus.  Loved this when it first hit the shelves this season.

Taste grapefruit/lemon, and can also taste piney flavor. Bitter, almost puckering aftertaste.  M: Feels pretty solid. Rich. Wow, bitterness really hits the sides of my tongue.  D: Very easy to drink one or two of these. Much more than that, I don't know, really because of the bitter (not bad) aftertaste that it leaves.  I was very excited to try this beer, with all of the good things that people say about it. I was lucky enough to pick up a couple today before they are gone for the year, and very glad that I did.

140,1904,Dave128,3.97,"12 oz bottle poured into a basic mug (Hey its all I had at the time). Last of my only 6 pack of celebration 2010.  A - Head is not too impressive. With a vigorous pour I didn't get more than 2 fingers which subsided pretty quickly. Lacing is average. The initial head sticks to the glass but only a few small patches actually make it through the enjoyment process. Tons of little particulates swirling around  S - I love the smell of this beer. ""Fresh Hop Ale"" is the perfect way to describe it, as is listed on the label. Smells like fresh hops. Very piny and wintry smell. Fresh and basic.  T - I'm not sure what to say about the taste of Celebration. Well.. It's straight up hops and like a piny resin. A tiny bit citrusy, but mostly bitterness and more bitterness. Not exactly up my alley, but I'm not gonna fault a beer for bitterness when my palate is still pretty immature and I'm growing to appreciate it more and more.  M - A little bit harsh on the carbonation IMO. It has the effect of bubbling up in bitter froth in the mouth that I didn't really like.  D - Again.. I wanna say this beer is unbalanced because the bitterness just seems a little too much, but there's something about it that makes me want to go back for more after every sip I take.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Malt is toast, toffee, and caramel.  Carbonation is sharp and crisp. Leaves a slight sticky residue with a sweet malt aftertaste.  Nice combination of a malty pale ale and the fresh, whole cone hops.

Oops, I guess I'm a little behind. Do MLK and Presidents' Day count?  Appearance: Nice thick head, looks like you could balance a stack of coins on top. Cloudy amber color, definitely some sediment and ""quiet"" carbonation activity.  Smell: Hello! A citrusy hop surprise. I feel like this one's got a lot more aroma than some of my other recent IPA tastings. Could it be that seasonals are generally fresher by nature or is this due to the advertised ""fresh hops?""  Taste: Full of flavor. This IPA is more on the citrusy, as opposed to the piney, side. I like it a lot - it's got a spicy kick on the tongue!  Mouthfeel: It's pretty smooth and coats the entire mouth...  Interlude: Yikes, I guess I liked this so much, I ran out before I finished the review, a first! Time to crack into #2 (holding the bottle up to the light, there is a ton of sediment swimming around)...  Mouthfeel (cont): Mouth feels good.  Drinkability: I could move through a few of these pretty easily. And SN always seems to be priced right for the job.

Strawberry, cantaloupe, grapefruit, honey, and a flowery undertone like roses or gardenias. No distinct ""malt"" aromas readily apparent.  T: Ah, there they are. Malt character is like a good crusty bread, forming a steadfast balance to the bitter, which is quite pronounced and dominates the latter phases of a sip. Strawberry and grapefruit accents.  M: Firm, medium-bodied and just a bit lingering without being sticky or unpleasant in the finish. Bitterness excites the palate on two levels, a standard overall bitter flavor with a sharp, astringent sensation that follows short on the heels of a swallow.

140,1904,llllDrGONZOllll,4.3,"12 oz bottle poured into a stemmed tulip glass.  Celebration has thick rock head that reminds me of hand churned French vanilla ice cream. Off white and rocky, it really looks as if it may need a spoon. The retention does hold well and each gulp of this amber-gold IPA leaves cakes of dense lacing. The body is hazy from the amount of hops and is lightly populated with a fine dusting of yeast.  Aromas of grapefruit and floral soap merge with pale malt. Spashes of caramel and toffee are present, more so than the glint of booze. Hop aromas come no finer than the Cascade and Centennial. Both hops are ""celebrated"" perfectly. I look forward to this release every year, and have never been let down.  The taste is rather bitter at the start. The tip of the tongue is greeted with an unbalanced explosion of citric hop flavor. Orange, grapefruit with soapy floral delights. The finish while still bitter does come with a taste of caramel and toffee. The toasted grains are dry and non cloying. The carbonation may seem a bit high, but perfect to keep aftertastes from lingering. The aftertaste last only long enough to remind you to have another quaff....

T: Moderately bitter and quite resinous, with notes of grapefruit rind. Malt is caramel in character and provides a little sweetness, though it doesn't do much to curb the dry pine and grapefruit.

140,1904,allforbetterbeer,4.03,"Poured into a snifter, 2010 Celebration. Much anticipation for this brew.  Pours luminescent and clear, with a hue closer to amber than orange, thus making this darker than the standard American IPA. The color looks spot on for a winter IPA, and hints that the malts may be richer than in summer versions of the style. Lacing is crusty and wonderful, and head retention is very good. Overall this just looks wonderful.  The nose is a platter of malt laden with fresh juicy hops. I wouldn't quite say it is bursting with hops, but gets pretty close. Sweet sugary pine and citrus are fairly well balanced, with some bitterness in the nose that plays against the sweet notes well. A touch of pineapple and lemongrass (the latter being slightly astringent) are detected on the sides of the overall aroma.  A full dose of sweetness encrusted hops hits first as this washes through my mouth, and as these flavors wash around a robust and layered malt profile comes underneath bring bring some balance (too much wouldn't be good). The higher bitterness and slightly astringent qualities show up later and in the aftertaste. The entire taste experience moves through layers of sweet, bitter and malty, with hops being the driving force.  Mouthfeel is creamy as only IPAs can be, and on the full side of medium bodied. Carbonation is effective and controlled, and doesn't stray into the soda-like feel that can plague the lesser versions of this style. Drinkability is good, but if some of the astringent notes were removed it would be better. Bitterness isn't the problem here...  Conclusion: This is a very good IPA. That is spoken by someone who rarely seeks out examples of this much over-hyped style. I feel that this style of beer as a place, but that the addition of large amounts of hops to beer is a trend that often masks and detracts from styles that were never meant to be hop-driven in aroma or flavor. I digress. This is an American IPA, and thus it should be all about the big hop profile, which it is. I really enjoy this beer, and think that it still has elements of balance and craftsmanship, which I admire greatly. Sierra Nevada has long been one of the best users of hops in their beer, and this example deserves its reputation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

N- Nice balance of resinous dark/earthy hops with bright/citrusy hops on top of a light toasty malt.  T- Toasty caramel malt balanced by a firm hoppy bitterness. Some brighter citrus notes provide an accent to the deliciously balanced base. There is a light, vague fruitiness in the middle. Pleasant grassy bitterness lingers into the aftertaste.

A light amount of carbonation is visible along with some particles floating in suspension. S: There are moderate aromas of grapefruit and pine resin hops in the nose. T: Similar to the smell, the hops contribute lots of citrus flavors to the overall taste along with a mild to moderate amount of bitterness, yet they do not overpower the taste because they are well balanced by the underlying malts. M: It feels medium-bodied and very crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. D: If the alcohol content was a little lower, this beer could be considered as sessionable because it is rather easy to drink.

A - light, clear golden color with perhaps a hint of red, small head that leaves some lacing behind, looks fairly carbonated  S - had an awesome waft of hops when the bottle was opened, but on the actual nose of the beer it was pretty light and not very expressive; more malt on the nose than hops  T - excellent bitter edge, but interestingly without any strong citrus or pine elements, resolves into some malty smoothness but the bitterness really sticks around. Slightly boozy on the back end; reminds a bit of a winter warmer in that regard  M - nice light feel with crisp carbonation, maybe a slightly butter end  D - quite drinkable, though I'd imagine the hops bitterness would compound significantly after a few.  Overall a nice beer; would definitely have it again!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Pine and citrus dominate. Some caramel and bready malt notes.  Taste: Piney and citrusy hops slam the palate, amazing, and also it has a very fresh taste. Nice caramel and bready malt undertones, with some fruity notes. Very slight alcohol kick.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and crisp, medium bodied. Perfect carbonation.  Drinkability: Awesome IPA, with a nice hop bite! The beer is also very fresh tasting, which is typical with all Sierra Nevada beers.

140,1904,RossCain,4.13,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass  A: Pours a semi-translucent copper/orange with a foamy, lush 1"" beige colored head. The head lingered for quite some time until deciding to settle to a nice cap. Tight lacing and the beer left wonderful, full rings that stuck to the side of the glass all the way down to the last sip. Overall a very impressive presentation.  S: Upfront you are hit by a bouquet of smells dominated by fresh hops. Predominately floral and piney in scent with undertones of light citrus (tangerine being the first thing that comes to mind) which overall gives a nice, sweet balance to the nose.  T: Full forward on the hops upon sipping. Dominant notes of floral hops make themselves known combined with bitter pine taste very characteristic of the dry hopping. Minor notes of citrus (tangerine, orange) are also present which give a pleasantly subtle sweetness to edge off the bitter. Finishes with a moderate bitter on the palate well balanced by a simultaneously present subtle sweet caramel malt profile. A very well rounded beer in all, but still leaves just a little to be desired.  M: Medium body which is slightly slick in terms of mouthfeel. Possesses a lively, prickly carbonation which is very refreshing alongside the lightly dry finish.  D: Crisp, flavorful, and very very drinkable. Overall a very refreshing and well balanced beer. Definitely worth picking up a 12 pack or more for a great go-to beer. I couldn't see the taste getting old.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,adamhimself,4.03,"Celebration Ale is one of those beers that just grows on you over time. The flavor seems to vary from batch to batch, but you can taste the similarities. The pros are its not super heavy and the hop flavor is quite fresh. Though, sometimes the hop flavor verges on IPA and you would expect a little more ""spice"" since its a seasonal.

140,1904,engagechad,4.02,"I purchased this beer as a single at Corks and Kegs in Richmond, VA.  The beer poured beautifully with a generous, mighty head (I even stated such out loud to my wife whom was unamused). The lacing was chunky and the head dissipation was lumpy on it's way down, very healthy looking foam. The liquid itself was rather honey/amber if I had to categorize it and wonderfully clean. It was so clear and finished looking that I could see what was on the TV screen through the glass.  I was a little displeased with the nose on it I honestly couldn't get but a faint citrus and a slight malt undertone.  It was great to drink, it was incredibly refreshing and to be honest, as a new-ish beer drinker I'm not sure what words to put on the things I was tasting but it was fabulous.  It felt nice on the mouth, well hidden ethanol affect even at 6.8. Not a thin feeling brew but not thick either.  I could drink about ten of these in a session.. I'm not promising that I would still be standing by the end of it but I assure you, I would gladly drink ten in a session.  Chad",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Aromas are piney and earthy, no citrus notes, very dark hop profile. Malt backbone is solid, bready malt that matches the earthy, crisp conclusion to the taste.

Aroma: Grapefruit and piney notes on top of more citursy hop goodness. Malts are there and they put out a graininess in the nose.  Taste: A massive hop bite very crisp mouthfeel. The malts smooth it out only a little bit. Lots upon lots of citrusy hops grapefruit and piney bits all through it.

Rich copper, thick off white head...amazing lacing throughout the drink. Top notch.  The smell is not as hoppy as you'd expect, a bit more subdued than a Ruination or Hop Stoopid, but hops still pop.  Very tasty... hoppy yes, but not overly so. Great balance between piney hops and malt and just an amazingly easy drinking IPA. A bit more balanced IPA than Torpedo.

140,1904,BigHeavy,4.75,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a New Belgium globe glass. Beer enjoyed immediately.  A: Beer pours a beautiful coppery amber color with an off-white pillowy head approximately 1.5 fingers in height. The head persists throughout the entire glass and leaves sticky lacing all the way down. Celebration is nearly clear which showcases some pretty aggressive carbonation.  S: Smell is big on the piney hops. Despite the hop domination, it is possible to pick out some malty sweetness in the aroma. Do I detect a touch of alcohol as well?  T: Hops, hops, hops! Sweet lord my palate is bombarded with floral and piney hops. Said hops subside to reveal a tinge of caramel sweetness, only to replaced again by, you guessed it, an incredibly hoppy finish. Hop flavors are so incredibly fresh and crisp it's not even funny. Slight bite from the booze on the finish as well.  M: Oily and mouth coating, just how I like my IPAs. The flavor is carried to every nook and even down into the throat with each sip. Carbonation makes it very crisp.  D: Each sip makes you want to take another in rapid succession. Celebration looses just a half point because for whatever reason the booze creeps up on me something awful when I drink these.  O: Just an outstanding beer. Kudos to Sierra Nevada for producing my favorite American IPA. I look forward to this time of year every year. Can we BAs lobby for Celebration year round? I enjoy it fresh or aged.

Taste is lots of hops and if I didn't know it wasn't, spices, I know theirs none present. I get a little pine. Good bitterness.  Smells awesome. I get the hops and bitter but also a nice sweetness as well as the left over malts.  Mouth is medium to heavy. This makes the sweet of the malts fade gradually as the hops bitterness sits in on the center of your tongue.  Theirs nothing overwhelmingly awesome about this beer but its a great beer. Im not sure if its the hype surrounding the beer or if all its aspects just make it come together really well.

140,1904,FrankLloydMike,4.36,"I picked up a bomber of this on a whim around Thanksgiving and was really blown away. Since then, I've picked up a six-pack (this review) and had it on tap several times.  A: Pours a deep golden/light amber, quite clear but rich, with a huge, fluffy head that sticks to the sides of the glass. I pour about half the bottle, leave the room for a few minutes and the head is still at the top of the glass. This is a very handsome beer.  S: Hops dominate with a piney, almost medicinal quality; very clear, but not super crisp. This is nice, but pales compared to the taste.  T: Like a make-out session with the hops. Big fresh, floral hop flavor that is pleasant and strong without being aggressively bitter. This has got to be one of the best tasting, widely distributed IPAs around. The fresh hop flavor is like something I've hitherto only had from fresh, local beers.  M: Sticky, medium-bodied, with nice hop resin.  D: This one's a little dry, but that's to be expected. Unlike some other hop-forward IPAs, I could probably do a second without a glass of water, though it wouldn't be preferable. A very easy drinking, full-flavored IPA.  This is an excellent beer with luscious, fresh, floral hop flavor that's sometimes hard to find in bottles. For the price, you could hardly do better. A few notable New England breweries match and exceed this in terms of fresh hop taste, but for a beer being sent all the way from California, the freshness is unparalleled and nearly rivals local beer. Very well done.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: Bready yeast, grapefruit and cannabis hops, mellow mozzarella banana, strawberry jelly. Pretty good, yet mild. T: Balanced at first with a nice bitter sting at the end that lingers almost medicinally, the taste is as mild as the smell and with similar notes, kind of like strawberry shortcake with a bitter slightly cinnamon coffee-acid finish. The alcohol becomes noticeable after a few sips. I'm not so sure I like what they are going for here. M: Thinner, with a frothy carbonation that isn't creamy enough.

Presented a beautiful reddish-orange color with a finger and half frothy head. The nose was very citrusy but also I got a hint of spice, which made the anticipation of the taste heightened as a result. The taste was very consistent to the nose with decent carbonation. This is one fine IPA if I might add. Celebration good times! If you can get your hands on this by all means do so, especially for IPA fans.

140,1904,tmcelvain,3.58,"L: Clear copper, with a very little head. Very light malt smell, with lingering acidic bitterness. T: I'm very unimpressed with this. I'll not go into the lack of adherence to a winter style, but suffice to say that this is a hop-bitter beer. Slighhtly piney with lemony-citrus overtones. Not a well-balanced taste - relying on too much hop character, which to me tastes too much like a bitter stalk of celery. M: A little over-carbonated. D: Pretty high, despite my low impression on the other aspects. The hoppiness and carbonation are refreshing and palatable when considered for a sessionable beer, but I would be putting in some effort to drink more than 2.

Too much malt in it though. Could also use a bit more citrus hop.  Taste is a harsh bitterness, more pine, some caramel. Solid taste.  The bitterness of this beer is pretty harsh, Chinook hop characteristic. They come through pretty heavy. it hurts the drinkability a bit.  Mouthfeel is average. Not much to say there.

140,1904,TheHoppiest,4.35,"This is a review of the Sierra Nevada 2010 Celebration Ale, however, I also have a bottle of the 2009 Celebration Ale that I will also review, but not rate, as part of this entry.  2010 Celebration Ale:  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a bright copper color with a sticky white foamy head that slowly reduces. Very tiny bubbles make their way to the surface from the bottom of the glass.  Has a nice hoppy, malty smell, sweet and somewhat fruity. Some grassiness is also present upon swirling.  Has a nice fresh-hopped taste, spicy and bitter up front, like the pith of a grapefruit. There is an underlying sweetness that is also present, but overall, a pliantly bitter beer. I'd almost characterize this more as a fall hopped beer than a winter ale.  Medium bodied, with plenty of bite on the tongue.  Quite drinkable, this is one of the last of my six pack of 2010 Celebration Ale. Depending upon how well the 2009 cellared, I may save one for comparison against the 2011 next year.  Now for the 2009 Celebration Ale:  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. I saved some of the 2010 for comparison purposes. Pours a similar copper color, though it is slightly lighter in tone than the 2010, and the head is not nearly so sticky or foamy.  Smells sweeter, less hoppy, and more yeasty. This may be a function of the aging and mellowing of the hops after one year.  Less hoppy, sweeter, slightly maltier, and a fair amount more alcohol taste. I'm guessing these differences are due to the age, and are not necessarily reflective of how this 2009 ale was when is was brewed.  Mouthful is similarly medium-bodied with less bite and spice.  After one year, it is clear that this beer is best when celebrated closer it's birth rather than it's anniversary. As such, I recommend you drink up your 2010 Celebration Ale now!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: Everyday bread malts, like twelve grain - hearty with a bit of sweetness. Coming in with just enough bitterness and pine in moderation. There's a mild spice aspect.  M: Smooth and silky with a medium body.  D: These is a a beer that shows a lot of restraint.

Light, fresh hops are not overwhelming. They are balanced with the malt so that you still get a good amount of sweetness. Apricot and peach. Great mouthfeel. Medium bodied and resiny. Sweet but not syrupy. Bitter but not dry. Carbonation seems a bit low. Very easy to drink and enjoy. Lighter fruit flavors and malty sweetness quickly give way to a hoppy finish, leaving you with a nice pine taste. Every year I forget how much I enjoy this beer.

140,1904,drewba,4.29,"A - Pours a nice three finger cream head. Color is a rusty orange and sticky, heavy lacing.  S - Very impressive aroma - chalk full of pine and complex citrus hops. I think the malt backbone is trying to come out with a little bread aroma, but still is overwhelmed by the hops. A little alcohol smell is present.  T - Lovely balance of malt and hops, both are there throughout the entire taste. The hops may eventually take over in the end, but I really like the boldness of both working together. Lots of bread, nut and caramel are representing for Team Malt, while Team Hop is putting forth grass, pine, grapefruit, lemon rind. Imagine a Flying V of Malt and Hop goodness, if only the malt stayed through the finish, which is where the hop bitterness takes over.

140,1904,ThePorterSorter,3.95,"2010 Fresh hop celebration ale  Appearance: Pure, shining copper when help to the light, but darker when resting on the table. There was a light tan - white head that formed, but quickly turned into lacing down the glass. I note very visible carbonation and a small amount of sediment at the bottom. Overall the beer looks inviting so we shall see what's to come.  Smell: Strong piney hops with a slight grapefruit. Hoppy enough to be an IPA, but not labeled as being such. I am super excited to see how this bitter lends itself to my palate. My guess is that it's likely balanced because even though the hops are strong they are not intrusive.  Taste: This is an excellent ale, hoppy with a rich malt, it's a beer that completely satisfies. As a gulp is swished around and I am able to take in a deep breath to aerate, sweet flavors are released from the malt and the bitter is pushed towards the back of my tongue. Unfortunately, the bitterness leaves a grapefruit rind grossness in my mouth that does more to prolong rather than invite my next sip. However, paired with a good meal this beer would be perfection.  Mouthfeel: Bitter and medium bodied ale that I unfortunately find as having an overpowering and distracting bitter aftertaste that prolongs approximately 30sec-1minute post consumption. I have had a few of Sierra Nevada's special releases ie. Northern hemisphere and Estate Homegrown, which have a less distracting bitter aftertaste and provide for a more enjoyable drink.  Drinkability: Although I do have some minor criticisms, this beer is excellent overall and does well to relax the body and spirit.

140,1904,DelMontiac,4,"2010 12oz bottle was poured into heavy pint glass.  The look of Celebration is exactly how I remember - crystal clear, copper, 2 fingers of white froth that withers quickly to a thin blanket which stays with you to the last drop. This creates remarkable lacing and each sip is marked on the side of the glass.  The aroma is floral and citrus hops with a sweet maltiness and a bisquit tinge.  Celebration gives you floral/citrus hopiness up front, sweet bisquity maltiness in the middle, and nice bitter hopiness on the finish. Great balance.  The feel of Celebration is comfortably in the middle of the spectrum and slightly dry. A great place to be.  Celebration is highly drinkable considering all it's positive attributes. It's a mild IPA, one that won't have you belching a pine or spruce forrest all night long. Very good. This is why we run to the store upon its arrival so we don't miss out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,degochapa,4.01,"I struggled a little bit with this one.  It may be due to my really liking the Sierra Nevada Northern Hemisphere Harvest Brew so much. I had both that night and really liked the Harvest over the Celebration.  A- Nice colors involved, poured with solid head.  S- Smell was much to similar to their amber  T- Good taste, still.. to close to their amber.  M- Held nice on the tongue.  D- I would choose their brew over the majority of other brews out there.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,chefhatt,4.5,"I poured this beer in to a glass, it has a nice reddish body with a little bit of white frosty head. The smell is very hoppy.

140,1904,BeerBuckeye,4.3,"A - Pours a golden amber with a fluffy head. Carbonation working up from the bottom, a bit of lacing.  S - You can smell the hoppyness of this beer. The malts are sweet, a bit of a flowery scent.  T - Very good. Good amount of hops, the taste is quite flowery. It's a little sweet in the beginning and middle and then turns a good bitter on the end, it's spicy without the spice.  M - Not too much thickness there, coats the throat a bit, but nice and dry in the mouth. A little less carbonated than I expect  D - It's easy to drink, but I prefer to enjoy it over a while. The hops are pretty strong in this one so as to not become overbearing, it's better to just take small drinks and savor the flavor.  Overall - Simply delicious. I love the hoppyness of the beer.

Hoppy; fruits and floral notes. Has a nice grainy malt as well. Biscuity malts, good solid mouthfeel - can session the hell out of this one. Finishes refreshing - slightly dry and a tad bitter.

The smells are pretty robust and full. The beer has a heavy hops undertone, with top flavors of citrus and spice. The spices taste like coriander and nutmeg, and they do a good job of not overpowering with the spice. The beer has a smooth and round feel in mouth, with a sweet, crisp finish. The beer has a slightly bitter hops aftertaste, with some of the spices present there, as well.

""Watered down"" description does not apply now. For a guy who finds big 2IPAs like Hop Stoopid ""sessionable"" this is a lovely, more subdued change of pace. I will have to excersise lots of will power to stop with this one pint tonight.  A: very clear amber, doesn't look particularly exciting except for the lovely foamy head. A: subtle citrus peel, nothing special. T: nicely balanced, prominent hop finish. M: certainly ""weighty"" enough for an IPA. O: while this beer is really nothing special, it is the definition of a session IPA, and it's wide availability and affordability is a blessing we mustn't take for granted!

140,1904,rembrant,4.31,"There is a wonderful and quaint myth that Celebration contains punkin pie spices or some coriander or minced up christmas trees...Then again you also may hear reindeer on the roof if you guzzle the whole 12 pack. For some beers...guzzle the 12,would seem absurd. With celebration,I find it a rather tempting notion.  There are no added spices just the elemental BEER things.  I love that art on the label/6pk/12 pk with the Poinsettas and the cabin in the snow. I gotta scan that and photoshop up christmas cards to all the kind relatives who stopped by in the last month bearing Cel;ebrations. Ironically, in my decades in Calif...I didn't have so many of these as I've had this month.  Pours slightly reddish amber,lots of cream colored froth and will lace the whole glass as you empty it.  Aromas a whiff of Citrus,breadiness,caramel. Flavor - A brief hint of caramel toasted malt and then the hops. In the winter,I chill a bit less aggressively-and likely that accounts for some added malt substance. The Malt side is the backup band here and several hops do a Do-Wop harmony with Grapefruit leading,but some piney,spicey and Ganga Resin detectable. Quite a nicely designed show. I think there's more malt background than SNPA and a bit more complex hops. I recall Torpedo being a bit more bitter but here the hops get to show off flavor more.  All in all, a superior IPA and that's something as there's a lot of good IPA's. That $15 12 pack price...obviously is a factor too as I seemed to snatch them up passing through the supermarket. I would not quite say the mouthfeel is sticky,yet there's a bit of that from the hops,and the body is ""right"".  Drinkably, not the lightesrt and wettest but I'm reviewing the second bottle which I'd opened about 15 min after finishing the first. Usually, I space my beers. I even peered into the bottle to be sure it really was empty. Alas...it was.  Makes the grey skies of winter a bit more cheery. Not a budget killer. Each bottle seems to feel like a damn good idea. Not sure why this seems more than it is...must be those mythical spices. Jingle all the way.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: A bitter spicy punch starts things off with some sweet caramel malt flavors with a touch of a toasted flavor finish it off with a bittersweet aftertaste that lingers for awhile and leaves you wanting more. Plenty of hops on the back end as well remind you that this beer is made for hop lovers. M: Sort of heavy on the mouth with enough carbonation that you know it's there. Very smooth though D: Good drinkability. this beer seems like it's gonna sit a little heavy so one should be enough but two wouldn't be an issue. I don't think this one would be too sessionable.

A: Pours a nice, moderately sized white frothy head with ""pancake batter bubbles"" in the middle. The beer is a very deep orange, but glimmers in the light so I can see the carbonation rising.  S: Smell is of sweet hop oils, like an IPA slightly past it's prime.  T: Big flavors of citrus and grapefruit punch through early, but are followed by mild ""Christmas"" flavors of cinnamin. Maybe a little coriander?  Far from my first encounter with SN Celebration, this beer always drinks so smooth for an IPA. Just a smooth, approachable IPA with a reasonable amount of citrus/grapefruit.  M: A smooth brew that falls apart lightly in the mouth, it has appropriate carbonation and finishes with a good hoppy dry finish.  D: Another great one from Sierra Nevada, this is quite drinkable. As far as Christmas Beers goes, it's not a *typical one* because it's base style is an IPA. But I love IPA, and I would drink this year-round if they brewed it year-round. It's excellent.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: A ton of carmel malt and toasted grains, slightly bready with a nice hoppy finish - citrus peals and earthy pine.  T: Good amount of bitter hop up front - grapefruit rinds, earthy moss, sweet resinous sativa backed by cereal flakes, toasted grains and nutty carmel malt.

140,1904,SnowGoon99,4.38,Serving type: bottle into a Stella Artois glass  Pours an amber color with hints of straw to orange in the light. Head is slightly off-white with great lacing down the glass. Aroma is somewhat subdued but i do catch some grassiness from the hops.  Flavors that instantly jump out are bitterness from the hops as well as a grassiness or earthiness. Also hints of caramel come through behind the hops. The bitterness it almost perfect. It's completely balanced with the maltiness and is not overdone at all. What this calculates to is an extremely balanced beer which is hard to do these days with the hop bombs out there. It fits perfectly to style.  Overall this is really a awesome beer. It does what it says it does and tastes great. You could order multiple pints of these in the pub or take down a six pack.

A: 12 oz bottle poured into a shaped pint glass... slightly dusty, light amber / red with a massive 3.5 finger, off-white, milkshake-esque head (classic Sierra Nevada) that leaves light sheets / rings of lace.  S: Grapefruit and pungent citrus hops; maybe a hint of pine; some herby hops, too; caramel and light biscuit malts. Smells great!  T: Full flavored IPA... big time grapefruit bitterness with some pine; caramel malt sweetness and some scant hints of alcohol.  M: Full-bodied and creamy; near crushingly bitter on the palate; leaves you almost parched.  D: Such an enjoyable beer - very well rounded... looks good in the glass, has a great aroma and taste with an impressive mouthfeel.

140,1904,TheKingofWichita,2.18,Pours a deep brown orange color with a thick white head and a little lacing. Smells of oranges and piney hops and more hops and more hops.

Drinkability is low.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,thagr81us,4.27,"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bitter hops, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt and pin/citrus hops. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this is a damn fine brew. Has a great aroma and flavor going on in this one. I actually enjoyed it from the bottle a little more, but not a huge difference.

140,1904,BamaViper1,3.91,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  The 2010 SN Celebration pours a transluscent amber brown into the glass. It forms a thick, creamy, off-white head that sticks around a little longer than anticipated. The head produces nice lacing.  The beer has a clear, fresh hop aroma accented with notes of grapefruit and grass. There is also a slight hint of fruitiness as well. A very faint bit of roasted malt and sugar can be detected too.  The Celebration opens with a bit of hop funk and citrus. Dried fruit and a bit of malty backbone come through next. There is the slight kick of alcohol, and then the beer finishes in a duel between bitterness and fresh bread.  The beer has a medium body with good carbonation. The finish has a bit of viscosity, which compliments the rest of the mouthfeel.  The medium body and hop notes make this beer easily drinkable, as does its 6.8% ABV. Sierra Nevada has created a very balanced IPA, and the holiday release nicely competes with the more spice-laden holiday beers typically seen at this time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Also very clear and no yeast present like a bottled conditioned beer.  S - Smells of Lemon, Green Grass, Yeast, Pine and slight Malt sweetness. I wish they would dry hop this beer to highten the smell caracteristics.  T - Tastes of Lemon, Orange, Grapefruit, Carmel and Pilsner Malt.  M - A nice fruitness with a good Hop Bite from the fresh hops. Carbonation is a little high and the body is light which is great for this type of beer.  D - This is very drinkable as nothing is over powering and the alcohol content make this one the best sessionable beers made.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Lots of malts in the smell with a cidery apple like scent. There is not as much hop scent as I thought there would be. The smell does not match the taste.  Tons of west coast pine hops are in the taste with some celery and citrus. Some malts help balance the hop taste creating a hop heavy brew.  The mouthfeel is medium with a good deal of carbonation. The bitterness is medium with a nice finish.  Another solid ale produced from SN. I would say this is medium in the scale of drinkable.

T - Nice malt backbone, more floral hops to start with an even bitterness, and then ends with a nice citrus finish.  M - Moderate body, a touch too much caramel malt but nothing offensive. Finishes a little heavier than it could with a touch more carbonation.

There is also a citrus hop presence and the presence of spices to round out the flavor. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. The drinkability is good, it is a smoother drink than most ipa's.

140,1904,mellowmark,3.63,"Poured from a 12 oz. short brown bottle to Imperial Pint glass. 2010 batch. Don't know the exact brewed on date. $14.99 for a 12-pack.  Appearance: Rusty amber color with a generous 3-finger head. Mostly translucent. Head sticks around for a while and leaves thick lacing all down the glass. The appearance is definitely the high point of this beer for me.  Smell: Smells of earthy hops and bright citrus. Some bready notes as well and a caramel like sweetness. Pleasing.  Taste: Hop bitterness right at the beginning sustains to the end. A little bit of citrus and malt sweetness try and keep the bitterness at bay and even things out. Tastes of grassy earthy hops and mild grapefruit. It's pretty bitter and isn't for everyone. Myself I prefer a little more malt or citrus presence in my IPA to counteract that bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is medium with high carbonation. More biting than I would prefer, even for an IPA.  Drinkability: Medium  It's pretty decent, but not something I would actively seek out again. Kind of surprised it's rated so highly, but I guess we all have our preferences. I'd like to try some aged and see if it doesn't change my mind.  ---2005 vintage (3-16-11)---  Well speak of the devil! Found this 2005 bottle at my local beer store right next to the 2006 2007 2008 and 2009 versions. I figured I might as well go all out and get the oldest batch, so I did.  Appearance: Pours a copper amber color with orange highlights a 2-finger slow rising yellow head. Head retention is pretty mediocre, leaves a ring after about a minute. Murky as all hell, almost no transparency whatsoever. Little chunks floating around.  Smell: Very malty in the nose. Almost no sign of any hops. Spices like nutmeg and ginger. Fruity. Dark fruits like raisin and plum. Smells kind of like a Quad.  Taste: Surprisingly bitter up front then it just gets washed away by the malty sweetness. Earthy hops are very present, surprisingly. Spices and sweet malt. It's much sweeter than fresh. It's a little off to be honest. Kind of astringent.  Mouthfeel: Body is medium and kind of sticky with a medium to high carbonation.  Drinkability: Medium  Appearance: 3.5 Smell: 4.0 Taste: 3.0 Mouthfeel: 3.5 Drinkability: 3.0 Overall: 3.5  I would say I like 2010 a little better than the 2005, personally, but it's very close overall. It's a much different beer after over 5 years. Celebration is a rare example of an IPA that can be aged for years and still be very drinkable, however.

The signature SN hoppiness is here, firmly in the center with a pronounced bitterness. The sweet malts are on the periphery. Good taste.  Mouth is very good for an IPA. Good carbonation, leaves the palate dry.  Drinks like a champ. One of the finest examples of an affordable, approachable American IPA.  I've had my share of SN Celebration this season. It is worth noting that there is a huge difference in both the nose and taste at 3 weeks compared to 8 weeks. The 8 week old beer, reviewed here, is solid and worthy of praise. The 3 week old celebration is phenomenal, on par with some of the best IPAs on the market today.

140,1904,HoopTime,4.28,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint on Christmas Eve from a growler filled that afternoon at Al's of Hampden.  A -- Pours a rich foamy1.5"" head with a light caramel tint. The head receded about halfway, then lingered a while while leaving a back-of-the-spoon type coating of lattice on the glass. This is a rich amber with a hint of burnt orange that is remarkably clear. The carbonation bubbles steadily through the middle of the glass. I sat mesmerized watching the chamagne-style bubbles streaming to the top.  S -- Though this is a fresh hopped ale, it does not have that overpowering middle of a pine forest with a pitcher of grapefruit juice by your nose hoppiness to the nose that other fresh hopped ales I have tried had. This is more subtle hoppiness. Unlike fresh hopped beers I have had that you could smell five feet away, this one takes getting your nose over the glass to pick up, but when you get close you will find a hint oi evergreen with citrus undertones.  T -- This starts off bitter and hoppy, citrusy, almost like carbonated grapefruit juice. Then the malt kicks in and balances it out for a very smooth, refreshing finish.  M -- Incredible effervescence, almost champagne like. This pour was extremely carbonated despite my having to open the growler when I got it home to replace a leaky metal lid. Light, bubbly, this damces on your tounge and tickles down the throat.  D -- A little strong for a session beer, but not by much. I could drink this all night.Praise Sierra Nevada for going a different direction from most in a holiday beer. Instead of a big, high alcohol spiced or fruited dark beer, they stuck to the basics and simply produced a beer fitting of celebrating the solstice  Having been turned on to wet and fresh-hopped offerings this fall, I expected this to be more like them, yet was not disappointed in the least by the more subtle approach.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The citrusy hop taste is by far the dominant component here, though, and it lingers, coating the tongue with a bitter aftertaste characteristic of the style. overall an njoyable IPA (coming from someone who is not a huge hop head). I feel like a late december night in the soggy northwest surrounded by conifers and earth is the perfect place to enjoy it (which is where I am now. convenient)  drink it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Northjames,4.03,"12 oz bottle.  The color is just about perfect for an IPA. Half inch head is thick and chunky.  Bready smell, in a very good way, faintly yeasty. I also smell some herbal hops.  There is a nice toasty aspect to the first taste. Hops are piney, herbal and dry the tongue nicely.  This is not a thick beer. The body is a nice transparent showcase for the hops.  Drinkability is good. I would have another. A very high quality IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ms11781,4.24,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.  Pours a reddish orange color with a 2+ finger, creamy, off-white head. Quickly ends up being a half finger head that sticks around for the duration and leaves a nice lacing all the way down the glass.  Smells of earthy, piny hops with a hint of malt sweetness, but not much. The occasional citrus note pops up now and then, but for the most part the earthiness and pine dominate.  Taste is grapefruit and piny up front. Little malt sweetness. Tons of hops. Bitter at the end with a citrus taste that sticks around on the tongue.  Medium body on this one, perhaps even a bit heavier. Same with the carbonation. A bit more than medium but not close to high at all.  Drinks very easy for a beer this hoppy with the body it has on it. Gives me the feeling that on some nights 2-3 could be the limit and on others a decent amount more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,boomer31,3.93,"2010 Version  A - Pours a reddish copper color with a thin white head.  S - A touch of fresh piney hop. Not as much as I'd like  T - Nice grassy hop presance. Biting hops balance with a nice caramel malt. The finish is nice and dry, very grassy.  M - Dry and highly carbed  D - A very nice seasonal, one I've enjoyed but never reviewed.  Overall a nice IPA, better than most, could be very special if the nose was a bit more pronounced.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Hopalong29,4.1,"For being a seasonal, I was not overwhelmed with the presence of spice. Nice 1.5"" head that lasted a good 15 min.

140,1904,Duttonic,4.5,"2010 batch poured into a Sam Adams pint glass.  A- Ruby red/orange in hue, two fingers off-white head that fades quickly, medium/large bubbles in the head, decent bubbling in the carbonation.  S- Spicy, dry, hoppy, pungent aroma. Pretty much what you want your IPA to be, if you are a hop-head.  T/M- Ka-pow! Hop bomb for your taste buds. Spicy at the front, smooth with just enough carbonation to tickle your buds in the middle, and a nice crisp and dry finish.  D- Wow. I wish this were year round. I love IPAs and this exceeded my expectations. Must stockpile for the long winter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,welldigger888,4.45,"Gave this a little bit of a rugged pour and to my surprise, A little white head that receded quickly with good lacing.Ruby orange hues on this elixer. Strong citrus goodness from hops but also some malty tones in the nose.Grapefruit and a nutty toasty quality seems to be the order of the day on this batch. Very nice bracing pucker from the grapefruit rind flavors and some biscuity tones toward the finish, but overall a good showcase for the hop. This brew has a wonderful mouthfeel with excellant carbonation on tongue and of course a nice hop oily feel. This is what I want for the christmas season, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!

Taste - I really didn't like this at all on my first taste, but after a few more it seemed to get much better. Some decent flavorings in there and well hopped. Aftertaste didn't linger too long so that was good.  Mouthfeel - This was exceptional and usually I don't even notice this catagory much. The head was very smooth almost like putting your mouth into very light whipped cream.  Overall - I respect this beer and can tell its very well made. I understand why IPA lovers give this high ratings.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SawDog505,4.45,"Poured into my 12 oz tulip glass. Bottle says it is around 50 days old. Pours a redish orange, a little haze with two inches of white head. Solid lacing that doesn't disappear until the end. The hoppy smell like grapefruit and pine got blended together. The taste even more powerful then the smell, with a sharp dry finish. Drinkability very nice, but this is all about the hopps, malt is barely noticable in the taste. A wonderful IPA, that will be my go too beer in November, December, and January for many years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Swedes21,4.45,"12 fl oz ml served in a chilled sniffer glass  Apperance - beer pours a gorgeous hazy auburn colour. There is a nice stream of carbonation in the middle of the glass. Head is very air filled, about 2 fingers high. Head is off-white in appearance. Some nice lacing as well.  Smell - I can pick up a nice balance of pine, hops, floral and caramel. Very smooth and fresh smelling.  Taste - beer taste fantastic, well balance and a decent amount of fullness. You can taste the caramel and pine hops right upfront, some bitterness near the end. I can pick up some deep fruits, almost a dark fruit.  Mouthfeel - the mouthfeel really adds a decent level of carbonation that make the beer creamy and full on the palette. I really like the added bitterness at the end. You can taste more citrus in the mouthfeel.  Drinkability - is it over already? Really, i can see why Spinrsx had trouble giving this one up in a trade! What a fantastic beer for a great day (just signed on for a new job)! Thanks Spinrsx for the trade and donation from your trip. This is a great beer everyone should try and stock.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DavoleBomb,3.28,"Poured into a snifter.  4.0 A: Nearly clear orange amber color. Two fingers of beige creamy/frothy hybrid head with great retention and moderate lacing. Uniformly small particulates throughout.  3.5 S: This isn't nearly as hoppy as I had expected it to be. Oh well. Malts are biscuity and offer some caramel. Hops are floral, citrusy, and herbal to an extent. I get some pithy fruit rind, grapefruit, maybe a touch of orange, and perhaps even some lemon.  3.0 T: Moderate bitterness. Malts are formitably bready and biscuity with some yeastiness in there as well. Caramel is the main malt flavor. Hops are herbal and citrusy, but aren't very strong in the flavor department. Some pith again with grapefruit and lemon. This is just too damn bready.  3.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Could be creamier and smoother. Just okay here.  3.5 D: I haven't had this beer before, but it doesn't seem to be that great unless other years have been different. It's overly bready and the hops aren't vibrant enough to pull it up out of the muddled flavors. This would be better if they made it cleaner or went full on with the malt. It's stuck in the middle area between good and good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cjacobsen,3.97,"Almost clear golden, honey color with a foamy off white head that stays for a long while.  Smells of hops, some biscuit.  Taste is a lot of hops. The fresh hops really cut through this beer and its quite tasty. Roasted malt and faint caramel in the aftertaste.  Not bad on the mouthfeel. It's a nice balanced beer with the bittering and the carbonation. It's not really smooth, but its got a lot of body and flavor.  This is a good beer. Hoppy and tasteful. This is a very good AmIPA. I actually read a post where a guy said that a liquor store clerk said this was a recommended spiced winter beer that some customer would like after the customer's original choice (an ACTUAL spiced winter beer) was sold out.

140,1904,plfahey,4.21,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance-Reddish copper in color, very clear. Nice fluffy off-white head stand with fine bubbles, good retention, and some nice lacing. Attractive.  Aroma-Hops! Big aromas of citrus, piney, catty hops, and some caramel/bready malt. No overt yeast character, and no flaws. Not a terribly complex aroma, but very fresh smelling.  Flavor-A little bit more balanced in the flavor, though hops definitely still steal the show. Citrus and pine hop flavors mix with moderate caramel and toasty malt, with moderate hop bitterness which rises in the finish to cut the malt sweetness. Even so, finish is still a bit sweet, though not cloying.  Mouthfeel-Medium body, moderately high carbonation. Almost a tad creamy, very smooth. No noticeable alcohol.  In my opinion, this one's a solid fresh hop IPA, but not an exceptional example of the category. Good, but not incredible. As far as drinkability goes, I could drink a shitload of these, which is not bad for a nearly 7% beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I was pretty excited to try this and it didn't let me down in anyway. Great IPA with Great flavor!  M: Smooth and satisfying  D: Great, If it weren't for the 6.8% I would have gone through my 6 back much quicker  one final note is that I have no idea how this has has the same BU's as Torpedo.

140,1904,droomyster,4.03,"Pours a slightly hazy dark gold/light copper with a big and sticky tan head. Lively aromas of predominantly orange citrus and caramelly malts, with a bit of resin in there as well. The flavors are positively jumping with hops, with some malty action on the mid- and back-palate to provide some stability.

140,1904,jay11284,4.73,"This is one of my favorite seasonal beers. The color of it is great and it's very drinkable. Offers some complex flavors too, a nice spice to it along with an easy to drink hop flavor.  Not sure if the label can be part of a review but I think the bottle and label this beer comes in is beautiful. A label is a drinkers first impression, so I think it's worth mentioning here.

Taste is of citrus grassy hops and perhaps a bit of mint or tobaco in the background, the hops are balance by a nice sweet malt that isnt overlooked but is not as present as the fresh hops in this beer. This is a medium bodied beer wiht a nice active amount of carbonation that leaves a nice dry smooth finish.

Initial pour left a lingering two and a half finger head around the glass that doesn't look like it's fading anytime soon.  Aroma is really fresh with slot of fruity hoppiness, very earthy with some grapefruit flying through. Slight detection of a Carmel malty nose.  Sweet, caramel malts up front, and finishes with a strong hoppy bitterness. Pretty balanced, and the caramel blends magically with the hoppy bitterness. The hops aren't overpowering, just a little punch.  Mouthfeel is mild, but a thick feel. I feel like this is thicker then some of the other IPAs, and it really is just an overall well made brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Shrews629,4.45,"Appearance - Lovely amber/orange/copper color with yellow highlights around the bottom and sides. A brilliant 2 1/2 finger off white head that hung around for a good long while and had a heap of lacing attached to the glass. The beer is hazy and inviting in appearance.  Smell - A very nice bouquet of floral and citrus hops fill my nose on the first whiff. As I dig a bit deeper, I find grapefruit and touches of lemon. I'm detecting some sweet caramel and orange also.  Taste - The flavor produced wonderful flavors of grapefruit and lemon citrus followed by some cinnamon spice. Adequate amounts of bitterness on all fronts. The alcohol hides way in the background with nary a hint. Picked up the orange flavoring as the beer warmed a bit.  Mouthfeel - Medium and dry. Smooth and inviting. Easy drinking and leaving more than enough on the palate. I tend to like a full mouthfeel, but this feels more than adequate.  Drinkability - I can see why people rave for this beer every year. Now, I will be also. What a great brew!!! Good in all aspects. I could make an evening of this without any sort of problem. This beer makes me want for Christmas year round. Definitely worth a try if available.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The smell of this beer is wonderful you can smell the spices they use for sure! The taste is nice very hoppy taste, a bit bitter the first sip but very nice on the ride down the throat. Mouthfeel is great a bit of a tounge puncher at first but goes down good. The best thing about this beer is it's drinkability, could easily go through a six pack on a cool winter's night(not to many in Fl but good to drink anytime)! Overall a great brew for the holidays!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,notsoprobeer,4.2,"Amber in color with a white head that lasted for almost the entire length of the drink. Nice lacing. Aroma is full of citrus hops. Flavor is mainly citrus (grapefruit) and some grassy hops. It does have a nice caramel malt backbone, but it is stands behind the hops in flavor. Medium bodied, good carbonation, and a nice crisp mouth feel. It seems to be a bit thicker than most IPAs, but I think it works well for a winter seasonal.  Really good! I want this again! While it does have nice malt flavors, make no mistake--this is a hoppy (bitter) beer. I like hops and it works for me. Bring this to your holiday gatherings, but understand that it won't appeal to all palates. If you're an IPA lover, this is a must try!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,hopsolutely,4.17,"An excellently drinkable beer. Dull amber colour belies an awesome smell and taste. Supremely hoppy and well balanced. My limited taste buds are unable to distinguish the specific hops, which I view as a compliment to the brewer's blend. Taste profile has a distinct start, middle and finish, across the entire mouth.  Higher ABV than I'd choose, but a truly fantastic beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

There was a good amount of bubble action in this IPA.  S: Smells of fresh piney hops mixed with some smells of spices thrown in and a citrus background.  T: First taste is of piney, citrusey hops and then comes the subtle but great spicy finish. Tiny bit of bitterness with this beer in the after-taste and during the initial sip, but easily handled.  M&D: Medium bodied feel with medium carbonation. I can drink these so easily and drink many of them before getting even getting sick of them.

Enough malt to make it interesting, but hops take center stage here from aroma to finish. It ends nice and sharp.

This beer begins with the spicy hops evident in the smell, then follows with a bit of malt for balance. The finish is dry, with spices and a bit of bread.

Head is off-white, frothy texture, that is long lasting and leaves an amazing amount of lace.  S: A typical IPA aroma of pine & citrus hops, hints of grapefruit, light caramel malts, & a little breadiness. A light, but crisp, nose that's not too overpowering.  T: Upfront citrus hoppy bitterness with hints of grapefruit, followed by a dry bready malt middle, and finishes with sweet caramel malts and a bit of pepper. A very clean and crisp IPA.  M: A lot of carbonation, medium body, crisp & lean texture.  D: This one is easy to drink for sure (second one for the night).

140,1904,epicness,4.12,"A: Dark ruby, almost copper-like color. Most likely best described as caramel colored. Nice frothy head and the lacing is out of this world. All over the glass.  S: Tons of citrus hop in the smell, but not to the point where it is too much. There's also a piney scent that lingers as well as some bready malts. Maybe a hint of caramel or my mind is playing tricks on me. Beautiful smelling beer.  T: At first, I get a very sweet citrus flavor, immediately followed by pine and bitter hops. The bitter taste does disappear rather quickly and leave with a caramel/bready taste. The end of the beer though finishes with bitterness coming back. The most distinct hop used it's definitely cascade (which give off the bitter citrusy taste).  M: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. A rich and smooth beer.  D: Very drinkable.

Pours a rich honey with ruby hints, with minimal light tan carbonation- yet long-lasting due to the overall age of this beer.. Rich pine resin mixes with ripe fruit, very complex hop aromas, mixing with the barleywine-esc dark fruit malt flavors..  A wonderfull blast of sweet malt is overthrown by a viscous tongue massage of hop flavor, sticky and green, working its way to a robust, fruity, boozy bittering...  Very enjoyable, indeed..

The dominant flavor component is the hops, lots of different hop flavors going on here. Pine, citrus, grass etc. This is a great session beer, a great beer to keep around the house but not my idea of what a winter beer should be. I like something darker with more spice to it.

Some caramel sweetness sticks its head in between the hits of citrus hops while some peppery character comes through with faint hints of alcohol.  T- Beer begins with a citrus hop sweetness punch and then lowers into a sweet malty middle. The middle brings along a faint bitterness that is overshadowed by caramel and biscuity/bready taste. The end of the beer is taken over by a swift kick of bitterness that fades into the aftertaste. Soft notes of alcohol become apparent at the end giving a slightly warming sensation.

M: nice, not to slick or heavy, and good balance between the two.  D: My first celebration, and it won't be my last, whether to session, or have by the case. Great stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ixodus,4.12,"One of my new favorites of Sierra Nevada. Since I first tried it I've purchased 2 cases.  A: Pours a beautiful copper color with a two finger thick cream color head, with amazing retention. If you dropped a marble into the center of the beer, it would have a perfect circle in the middle until the end. As for the Lacing, it coats the glass with sticky foam all the way down the glass until the very end.  S: Strong Notes of Orange and Lemon Zest, Grapefruit, Pine and Bready Malts.  T: At first, I get a very sweet citrusy blast of flavor, immediately followed by bitter hops. If I could pick out the most distinct hop used it's definitely cascade. Maybe even centennial. The hop taste almost reminds me of Founders Centennial IPA. As I let it warm in my mouth the bitterness retracts and I get a very nice bready, sweet caramel malt.  M: Medium bodied, rich, and smooth. Carbonation is spot on!  D: Very drinkable. If I have one, I'll put it down fast and won't hesitate grabbing another. 6.80% puts it a little lower then torpedo(which I also love) which is pretty low on my charts. If you know me, I love high abv beer. Honestley I wish this wasn't seasonal.  Notes: I picked this up originally not knowing this was an IPA. I honestly thought it was gonna be a spicy Christmas style beer. It's pretty cool IMO to have a Christmas IPA. It just makes me love Sierra Nevada more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: Great hoppiness to start and finish. Lots of Pine and carmel malt. Nice citrus undertones. This has a substantial malt backbone, yet still super hoppy and bitter. Outstanding. M: Crisp, bitter, smooth finish. Nice carination and creaminess. D: Outstanding drinkability!  Perfect winter seasonal that I look forward this as winter approaches.

S: A good amount of piney hops, smells like a christmas tree almost. Some citrus mixed in, but more pine.  T: Nice wet hop flavor, a very nice combination of pine and some grapefruit citrus. A malt sweetness backs it up.  M/D: Medium bodied, has a sweet finish, not very bitter at all.

140,1904,Yoonisaykul,4.22,"I had no idea this was an IPA before reading the label. Thought it sounded like more of an easy drinking Christmas beer.  A- That's a pretty beer. Slight haze in the clear caramel copper. Dirty-beige to light-white head is one finger thick and sticks to the glass.  S- Smell is great. Sweet grapefruit juice and apples with very little indication of the impending bitterness. Some nostril burning alcohol.  T- Yep. Very bitter and I wouldn't have known by just smelling it. Great grassy hop taste along with the grapefruit and it's the malt which lends a bit of apple sweetness to the mix. Very floral.  M- Close to full bodied but still easy drinking. Medium to high, close to perfect carbonation. Far from dry but there is some hop astringency.  D- Very good. Light but plenty of flavour and bitterness.  I'd probably drink this weekly if I could I think this is my third taste of Sierra Nevada (Pale Ale, 30th Anniversary Barleywine) and",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TheBrewo,4.15,"The brew pours a rich golden-orange color with vigorous carbonation. It is otherwise translucent, with the tiniest bits of yeasty haze dancing about. It holds a pancake battery-looking tan head of two fingers which, as it slowly recedes, leaves thick lacing around the glass. The aroma is of light, clean malts, with bright, soapy, and piney hops edging them out. There are also hints of fruit, with cherries and grapefruits getting the nod. Finally, there is an earthy smokiness to the very back of the nose. The taste begins, naturally, with hops, and a little green apple. They (the hops) are not as robust as expected, and are almost sweet and creamy. The malts crash in through the middle, mellowing things out quite a bit. The sip finishes with bitterness from citrus fruit, rejuvenated hops, and a curious bittersweet chocolate flavor. The same dominate the aftertaste, with pine from the hops standing out. The mouth is left more dry than coated by this medium bodied brew. The carbonation is also medium, and palpable, but not unpleasant. The abv is average and the drinkability is hindered, if at all, by the bitterness of the hops, which make you want to take your time.  Overall, this was a nice refreshing brew. What we liked most about this was how elegant it appeared, almost glowing. Everything else was certainly enjoyable, and the whole cone hops make for an interesting tasting. When we first starting sipping it tasted chocolaty, as if it were three-quarters American IPA and one-quarter chocolate stout which, again, made this quite a memorable selection.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A little sweet scent but mostly all hops. It smells amazing!  T: It's a delicious IPA with a hint of spice. I love it. It is perfectly balanced.

140,1904,airheadmtrcycle,4.35,"SN Celebration pours a clear, spectacular orange with a 3-finger foamy head that dissipates quickly but leaves lacing galore. Tiny bubble are rising constantly. What a beautiful site for a beer lover.  Smells of various citrus fruits, like grapefruit and sweet tangerine. Name a citrus fruit and you can probably find it. It's all about hops, but I smell some gratuitous malt that might give the tangerine its sweet smell. Bang! The bitterness gets you at first sip. Boy do these guys know their hops. As hoppy as it is it's still balanced. Don't get me wrong, everything is skewed in the hop direction, but it doesn't taste forced or unnatural. Just what you'd expect from a great west coast brewery like Sierra Nevada. As it warms I'm getting some pleasant pine-y flavors as well.  The mouthfeel is medium on the palate with refreshing carbonation. The hops are best tasted on the top of the tongue. Swirling around the palate really yields a full appreciation for this tasty ale. Very easy to drink, and I'll have no problem finishing the 24oz. bottle.  Celebration is a must try for west coast IPA fans. This is not my first go at this one, but the first time I concentrated on the details. I had one on-tap a couple of weeks ago and it was really good, but I was out with friends and not concentrating on the beer as much as the conversation etc. I'm gonna go back and try it on tap again and take some notes.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Notes of deep malt present with some very subtle hop aroma.  T: Rich in malt and hops. Slightly spicy up front then mellowing out to a nice dry finish. Hops linger long after the finish.  M: Medium bodied with a mellow carbonation level.  D: Nice beer to savor but easy to have multiple in one session.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,JunkYardJake,4.25,"12oz bottle to pint glass. Pours a clear, deep copper with quite a head. Big and creamy and lasts forever. Thick rings the whole way down the glass. Think there are a few hops in there? Well if the head doesn't give it away, the nose will. Truck loads of grapefruit and other citrus aromas flood the senses. Palate starts out with lots of hops. Fruity and piney with alot of raw flavor. Finish is dry and bitter to the core. This is American IPA at it's purest. Not alot of balance but it works. This is a nice break from all the spiced up malty heavyweights that are typical for the holiday season.

Has a large, frothy head that dissipates slowly and leaves some nice lacing.  Smell: Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit. This smells the most citrusy of just about any IPA I've ever had. A slight bit of malitness in the nose as well.  Taste: Citrusy and grassy hops notes throughout. Has a bit of graininess and maltiness towards the finish. Leaves a nice grainy aftertaste. This is what IPAs should taste like in my opinion.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied yet crisp and refreshing.  Drinkability: A superior IPA and really the benchmark for the style in my opinion. I look forward to having this every winter and every winter I'm more impressed by it.

So nice I took a picture of it. The smell was fantastic and just about what i expected from my first wet hopped ale. The taste was certainly hop forward with a nice malt in the back.

Hoppy aroma, mainly pine and citrus. Hops off the bat. Pine leads the way as the bitter hops lead. Very small grapefruit notes balance out the hop profile a bit. Despite the hops, sweet, thick, caramel and bready malt show up a bit until the end, where the bitter pine hops take over again. Very fresh vibe to this beer which is nice about a seasonal IPA.

T: tastes like a lemon muffin up front, and then the palate is inundated with a bonanza of tart citrus fruit, nectarine, perhaps some tropical fruit (mango?) and marzipan, the finish is long, dry, and very hopped, with tart grapefruit and grassy/piny/floral hop notes.

140,1904,MQ4188,5,"I am not a huge reviewer and I am going far out on a limb with this ale.  This is the best large production bottled beer I have ever tasted. Sierra Nevada hit a ""home run"" with this one in 2010. This is real close to the Sierra Nevada - Northern Hemisphere Harvest Ale they produced in 2010 in the 24 Ounce bottle.  The appearance was beautiful with a two finger, snow white head and a perfect copper color.  The smell had intense fresh hoppiness but floral and citrus notes as well.  The taste was amazing and hoppy and a bite that was not ridiculous.  Mouthfeel and drinkability was outstanding and one that was smooth and fresh with a lot of hop character that you don't see in an American IPA produced in volume.  If someone picked this one up thinking it was just like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale , then they got a big surprise! For the good; I must add.  If you are of the type that feel it is impossible to get all ""5"" ratings in a ""mass produced"" ale then I guess we will just have to disagree. I rated it as high because I wanted to give a ""mass produced"" beer the credit I feel it deserved.  Sure, I feel that there are many more that are different and better in, cask, limited 750ml, firkins, and the like, but this one was 12 ounce bottle and unbelievable for an ale which you can pick up in a grocery store. Find me another 6.8 abv. in a grocery store that is even close to the caliber of this, then we can compare. Until then, this one gets an A+ for an American IPA, in this category  Bravo, Sierra Nevada for taking it to the next level!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tburus,3.98,"Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Amber-gold transparent liquid with one-finger off white head. Vigorous carbonation that lasted through most of the session.  Smell: Hoppy with indiscriminate spices. Didn't seem to change much with increase in temperature.  Taste: Nice level of bitterness from the hops. Subtle spicing, not nearly as strong as I expected. Occasionally hit a burst of lemon.  Mouthfeel: Bitterness lingered an appropriate amount of time and did not overpower like some I feel some IPAs do. Again, surprised I didn't feel more spicy after notes. Felt like there was slightly too much carbonation.  Drinkability: This is a highly. Drinkable beer. Nothing over powering about it, just a nice, subtle, belly-warming winter selection. And at about $3/six cheaper than the Bell's Christmas Ale sitting next to it on the shelf, this would be an easy choice to make again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ryantaussig,4,"Solid head and a good nose on this beer. Smell is fantastic with excellent amounts of hop aroma and vegetal notes all over the place. Obviously hops are the star. Not well balanced, but this one is all about the hop bitterness so it's appropriate. Finish is a bit dry and the body is quite smooth for the style. Relatively easy to drink for an IPA. I'm surprised it didn't push me to a bitter burnout. The bitterness is obviously strong, but somehow it hits me the way Arrogant Bastard does. I can just keep drinking it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Head remains on top throughout. Smell is sorta nondescript for all the... spices. :-) Still some hop notes, grapefruity, malts come out too. Taste is good. Not a hop bomb, but definitely and IPA. Complex malts.  It's highly drinkable if you're eating Murray's cheeses melted on your tongue, and it feels full while you do it.  A win for Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tjsdomer2,4.2,"Appearance: Cloudy and yeasty. Nice tan foam. Very similar to Pale Ale, maybe a tad darker. Good lacing as well.  Smell: Not quite as strong as Pale Ale in my opinion. Subtle citrus and hops with a good amount of sweet malt and cinnamon.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Great taste! Strong pine hops, reminds me of a Christmas tree. Also great spiced orange peel. The taste hits it out of the park. Great! Good balanced mouthfeel as well, more so than Pale Ale.  Drinkability: Bitterness makes this a good session beer, but might make this hard to drink a lot of. That's nitpicky though. Great.  Overall: A more refined version of Pale Ale, which I also like.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Aromas of citrus and pine from the hops dominate but the sweetness is detectable. The same goes for the taste, which starts with a bready sweetness but immediatly progresses through pine and citrus with a long hoppy and yet somehow sweet finish. The booze is hidden very well under the hops. Medium body and good carbonation.  Definitely a good IPA and great for drinking near a Christmas tree.

140,1904,thegodfather1076,4.52,"2011 Edition  This beer was served out of a 12oz. bottle dispensed into a glass....  Presentation - Same label and look of the 2010 edition only has 2011 stamped on it. Very nice.  Appearance - SNCA2011 pours out the same beautiful amber color with a light and airy 2 finger foam golden white foam head that slowly fades to a nice frothy coating.  Smell - Smells of strong floral/citrusy/piney hops. Some hints of bready malts as well. A very nice, big smell.  Taste - Tastes very piney on the front end before the floral/citrusy hop flavor takes over. In my opinion SNCA2011 was a bit more hopped than the 2010 edition.  Mouthfeel - Very nice amount of carbonation with a medium bodied feel. In my opinion SNCA2011 has a bit more body than the 2010 edition and has a slightly creamy feel.  Drinkability - Excellent taste and smell to go along with being medium bodied and moderately carbonated make this an extremely drinkable offering.  Celebration never disappoints. While the profile is slightly different from year to year it is always an exceptional brew!!  2012 Edition  Presentation: SNCA 2012 sports the same basic label artwork and setup as 2011 with the exception of the 2012 marking on the neck. Neck label gives a fine description of the beer and has the 2012 marking. Front label has the festive artwork in the traditional SN style. Rear label has a nice back story on the beer, ABV info, and website info.  Appearance: I poured this from its 12oz bottle into a 16oz English Pint. SNCA2012 pours out a clear copper orange color with a 2 finger white foam head of light density. Head retention is exceptional lasting a full 4min before fading to a thick coating and ring. Lacing was very good.  Smell/Aroma: Smells of fresh hops with a citrus and piney scent very prevalent. A slight caramel malt scent can be detected as well.  Flavor/Taste: Tastes follows the nose as the citrus and piney hops rule. A biscuit-like toasty malt flavor is detected on the front end that gives way to an intense hop bitterness on the finish. Very well balanced flavor profile.  MouthFeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied with a slick almost creamy mouthfeel. Above average amount of carbonation. Insanely drinkable with an excellent profile across the board.  Overall/Comments: SNCA is a completely different beer from nearly all that one will find offered in the winter seasonals. An excellent twist on the traditional classic American IPA. The fresher the better with SNCA. A true classic every year and SNCA2012 held true to form. Classified as an American IPA at 6.8% ABV. Consumed 1/11/13.  2013 Edition  Presentation: Awesome label in the SNBC tradition that the festive SNCA feel with awesome eye-catching graphics and colors. Front label gives a bit of brewery info. Back label gives web info, ABV info, and a nice backstory on the beer. Neck label give vintage (2013) and a nice description of the beer.  Appearance: An aggressive pour from it 12oz brown bottle into a 16oz English pint led to a 3 finger white head of a medium rocky density atop a deep orange/copper/amber colored beer. Head retention was an awesome 5min 27 sec before fading to a thick coating and ring with phenomenal lacing.  Smell/Aroma: Smell is of piney resin hops with nice herbal tone. Citrus aromas are very prevalent along with a nice caramel maltiness.  Flavor/Taste: Tastes is of very piney resin on the front end with a sweet maltiness that balances out the resin very well. A sweet citrus hop flavor that blends nicely with a bready biscuit maltiness at the midpoint. Back end quickly turns pine hop bitter with a resin herbal aftertaste.  MouthFeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied with a slick and creamy mouthfeel. The perfect amount of carbonation make this very drinkable.  Overall/Comments: A truly great seasonal treat that I look forward to every year. The fresh hops are the star every year! A must drink! Consumed 1-21-14.

The hops smell great but are not overpowering. There is a great balance of aroma between hops and malts. The smell description carries over to the taste. The balance between hops and malts is almost perfect here. The citrus flavors from the hops are present at first and the bitterness is in your face but is instantly subdued to a more earthy texture.

140,1904,ibbjamin,4.02,"2010 Celebration - I'm about at the end of my first 6pack of 12oz bottles of the season and I've had a pint at my local watering hole. For some reason, this is the first year I've had this one. After having a few, I'm damn ready to write a review. I pour this one into a standard pint glass.  Half inch of off white, loosely packed head. Rather cloudy and dark orange in color. Good lacing and a nice layer of head retention. A slow and constant stream of carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass.  A wet hoppy nose with pine and citurs mainly, but still leaning on the balanced side.  The taste, like the nose, is of dripping wet hops. I seem to have liked the first couple the most and thought they were the most hoppy. The taste has grown to be more fatigued from my perspective and definitely leans more on the balanced side with the caramel malts coming through more and more.  Heavy carbonation in the mouth gives it a prickly character. This one is on the lighter side of medium body and has a crisp finish with a balanced aftertaste.  No problem putting this one back at all. I think there are other hoppy offerings I prefer to the 2010 Celebration, but this certainly was a welcomed change of pace and I'll surely be checking it next year again. Solid B+ beer for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,tapman,4.23,"2010 vintage. A great seasonal since, this being an IPA and all, aging it would break down the hop oils so you are REQUIRED to drink it right away, unlike Bigfoot. Also I will be comparing this one to the wet hop pale I had before this, 'Hopivore' by New Holland, since they are both similar and I am sampling them side by side.  Moderately light orange body supports a big 2+ finger head. Looks similar to the previous beer I sampled except with a great head. Makes a big difference.  Earth, vegetal hops, some musty grass, not bright or 'west coast style' as other offerings from this company. Raw alpha acids give off pine and even smells bitter.  Full-bodied spicy vegetation with a robust, not sweet, malt backbone. Soft bitterness is very satisfying. The 'Hopivore' was much more vegetal and used hops grown in Michigan. Perhpas a fresh hop brew just isn't meant to be brewed with low-cohumulone hops.  Carbonation is less than I expected and the brew is a little dry, but juicy during the taste and doesn't dry out until after the finish. While a little vegetal, it is more of a spice flavor than a bland flavor. Maybe it's the west coast hops, or maybe it's the great brewers, or maybe it's both.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,ColdPoncho,4.18,"It pours a lovely rosy amber color with a medium rolling head with good lacing and good retention. A beautiful-looking beer.  Smells of citrusy and piney hops, with a strong malt sweetness, almost like a dry wine or belgian dark ale. Quite interesting.  Nice spicy hops and light but complex malt backbone. It's got somewhat of a warming sensation on the way down, and a dynamic aftertaste, moving from bitter to dry. It's really quite fine, though the body of the taste has a tough time living up to the nose.  It's pretty thin, but not too light. Best of both worlds?  While I'd love to drink several of these, it's not necessarily the easiest to drink, even if it is good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CaptDavyJones,4.35,"Poured a clear, dark copper/red from a stout 12 oz bottle with no ABV or freshness date on the label. Solid, solid frothy head that stays for an eternity. The piney hoppy aroma hits you the moment the bottle is cracked open. Beautiful lacing as you keep taking mouthfuls of this beauty. Strong on the hops, with a hint of sweet caramel, but the pine-hops flavor overpowers in a perfectly balanced way. Hands down one of the best IPA's around. It will leave you with a nice buzz, drinkability is good, but I would recommend keeping the consumption in check. It is a very delicious brew, which leaves you wanting more. A solid beer from Sierra Nevada, highly recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SiepJones,4.5,"A: Pours a murky copper with an inch and a half of fluffy/sticky head. The head is slow to dissipate and lots of it stays attached to the sides as I empty my glass.  S: Sweet and Piney hop scent waft out of my glass. It smells like I'm standing in the middle of the forest.  T: There is a touch of caramel malt on the front of the beer. The malt flavor disappears quickly as the floral and pine of the cascade and centennial hop flavors take over. There is a slight bight at the end of this beer from chinook hops.  M: Medium body mouthfeel. I want to say it borders on being chewy. There is a lot of flavor going on with some tongue tingling carbonation.  D: Very drinkable beer with lots of hop flavor, and low ABV. Celebration has lots of flavor without blowing your taste buds to shreds and that is what keeps me coming back for more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,gregshead,4.22,A: Pours a copper orange with 2 fingers of head that dissipates quickly.  S: Caramel and pine aromas.  T: Taste follows the smell. Nice dry finish. I believe the fresh hops are very noticable in the tail-end/after-taste.  M: Smooth with a good carbonation feel to it. A little more thick/syrupy than some IPAs.  D: I love the fresh hops. Reminds me of Deschutes Inversion but the fresh hops put it a notch above. Will be getting multiple sixers of this one.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Jason,4.25,"12oz brown bottle with a vintage 2010 date on the label.  What an impressive head, very few beers show a thick lacing like Celebration does. Brassy amber color shows a bright clarity. Sharp citric and minty hop notes in the nose with some toasted grain in the back, a pretty big aroma. Medium bodied with a deep crispness. Hop bitterness is pretty sharp as it easily cuts through the malt from sip to sip. Hop flavors range from tobacco to mint, grapefruit peel to green tea. Toasted grain and a mild caramel maltiness lay deep beneath the hop character. Warming alcohol pokes through with a quick fume and clean fruitiness. Finishes bitter with a quick kiss of malt.

T: Up front taste is just as you would expect from the smell, bitters up front from the hops with a hint of citrus and what seems to be spices. Finish is smooth and dry with the lingering bitters remaining for quite a long time.  M: Medium bodied with average carbonation, hoppy and smooth in the palate.

140,1904,alkchrios,4,"I work at a local brewery and was talking to one of the bartenders about craft beer and such...basically asking if he had, had anything recently that was just a really great beer. I had seen celebration ale in the coolers the past couple years but never thought to purchase one..I always found myself reaching for something by a smaller company, or something that had a name I couldnt pronounce..not sure why but im sure weve all been there. Anyways I was strongly urged to pick up a 6 pack of SN Celebration.. so here I am. I have a hard time drinking really good beer straight from the bottle so I poured this into a standard old pint glass. The celebration pours a nice dark gold, almost copper but not as dark. Immediately you know this is going to be a rather carbonated ale due to all of the rising suds! The pour gave way to about an inch and a half head that kind of stays with you for a while. Upon smelling and tasting..to be honest, this is a great beer but its almost as though its a more refined, more grown up version of the standard SN Pale. Its crisp, not very complex but at the same time full of flavor and just overall, a well crafted brew. I would say that the alcohol is a bit more present in this ale..more so than other SN beers ive had.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - Orange candy, caramel, spice, floral. Really smells good.  T - Orange flesh and zest, pine, caramel, earthy spice, gooey fresh hops. Finish is a great balance of malt and bitter.  M - Medium-heavy body and medium carbonation. Rich, a little prickly. Coats the mouth. Not dry.  O - Delicious. Like a more citrusy, less caramel Northern Hemisphere.  Notes: I had a stashed 2015 bottle of this on 2018-08-11. Still tasted good. Hops had faded some letting the caramel and other malt flavors come through more. Minor oxidation but even so; still enjoyable.  The 2018 version is really tasting great again this year. Certainly less caramel than the 2018 Northern Hemisphere.  Original Review: Had this on 2010-12-04 in Columbia, PA. The label indicates this is a 2010 vintage.  A - Moderately hazy burnt amber 4.0  S - Pleasant citrus, mild yeast and hop floral. 4.0  T - Caramel malt, candied orange, grapefruit, earthy and a lingering sweet-sourness with astringent bitterness winning in the end.

The first sip finds it a little heavy on the hop bitterness, similar to my first impressions of a Victory Hop Wallop. But as it sits, it mellows into a nice balanced hop heavy IPA.  Really refreshing and a different style of IPA than your everyday run of the mill versions. Recommended!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Dark copper/red with a very fluffy white head that lasts for a while. S - Hops hops hops. Hint of malt. Mostly piney odor- with a bit of citrus. T - Lovely hops flavor up front. Hit with some malt further down the taste. A very astringent aftertaste. Personally I think this beer focuses more on a resiny piney flavor, with a lot less citrus emphasis (I'm a huge fan of the citrus). M - Smooth with nice bubbles. Coats the mouth - lot of staying power. D - Considering I had four of these, I'd say it's quite drinkable! I would have preferred two Celebrations and two beers of another type. Two of these is enough of this particular flavor for me. Drinkable considering ABV.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kevinconroy,3.28,"A: Decent color, nice amber brown/red/gold color. Dark color very appealing but not great  S: This beer has a pretty good smell. The reason I give it a 3 was because this is a fresh hopped beer. This beer should be oozing out that delicious fresh hop smell i crave in a fresh hopped beer. It smells good but not as good as i would like for a fresh hop.  T: Good taste; Not very balanced but good none the less. Very malty and then very bitter. Good bitter and good malt but not well put together. This beer had a little bit of a metallic taste to it for me; a little unpleasant. The fresh hop taste is nice and acidly but is not as fresh or hoppy as I would like for being a ""fresh hop.""  M: This beer has great mouth feel. Very creamy almost like a nitro or what a cast beer would have. Its always great to get something creamy out of this style. Very sexy lace drips down the glass all the way till the end. This is an almost perfect mouth feel. This beer sets the precedent for the style.  D: You could drink this beer all night but you would wake up in the gutter!  Overall: This is a good recommendable beer. It is worth a try but if you want something that truly represents a ""fresh hop"" beer this is not the beer you are looking for. On a scale of 1 to a 100 this beer is an 80. Good beer but breweries go through great lengths to fresh hop beer. This beer just has no craftsmanship, no soul.

There's a little bit of a piny bready taste with a grainy finish. All in all this beer has a very earthy feel to it. love it.  M - Well carbonated and medium bodied. washes over nicely.

The smell is somewhat underwhelming as far as IPAs go. It has the typical SN aroma. A little piny, slightly floral, not much citrus unfortunately.  Taste is very easy-going. Although very bitter, it seems that there is not a lot of flavorful hop presence. This isn't necessarily bad, but when I look to have an IPA, I usually want to be pummeled with Citrus and pine. This one seems to be very well balanced, but with a strong bitter profile. It lingers nicely, like most SN ales do.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Big, bold, fresh aromas from the get-go in the form of lemon rind, pine cone, peppermint, and fresh herbs. Biscuit malts provide depth and a massive wave of menthol pummels the palate and washes over the entire profile. Pine cone bitterness combines with the coolness on the finish. There's something almost slightly manufactured here, like a York Peppermint Patty and some fresh mint leaves were mashed into my glass. Maybe this is the result of the wet hopping.  Fresh, tingling, and crisp with a creamy thick body and high carbonation that doesn't detract from the smooth body. A strong point of this beer.

140,1904,movingtrain,4.13,"12 ounce bottle sampled from a standard pint glass.  Pours a nice amber color. With an aggressive pour, a firm fluffy head rests on top, with lots of active carbonation in the body of the beer.  In the aroma are hints of honey, grapefruit, apple, white grapes, and warm bread. The hop presence is quite full, providing a nice kick in the smell.  The flavor is quite fine, balancing fruity hop tones with a mellow, sweet malty undertone. And that head is sticking around...with each sip, it's not going anywhere. Other flavors that are present are red grapefruit, light candy sugar, minute hints of cinnamon, and, of course, a nice hop presence.  The alcohol in this beer is quite warming, which is nice on this cold December eve. It is surprisingly warming, given that it is just below seven percent, and other beers that reach this range don't always produce this effect. For a winter beer, this works well for Celebration.

You just know it'll taste good from looking at it.  Smell: Hops. Pine. Citrus. It's an IPA. The pine and malts are more prevalent here than other IPAs, which lend it that little bit of holiday flavor.  Taste: An exceptional IPA. This is really everything you could want in an IPA. The fresh hop bite and a wonderful pine, citrus, and malt backbone. If you like IPAs, you'll love this.  Mouthfeel: On the lighter side of medium heaviness and fairly carbonated. Feels good.  Drinkability: Nothing wrong with this here, just the right lingering aftertaste makes this a great drinker.  A great example of the style.

140,1904,joelbb14,4.52,"This is my second year drinking Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale. I remember last year, before I had turned 21, my (now) wife picked this for me because she though I would like it. She knows me well, I loved it. Now that I can obtain this fantastic drink on my own, I think it will be a major part of every winter from here on out. I was thrilled to see it on the shelves and quickly bought up the first two six's of the year.  Appearence. Definately orange, not completely clear, slightly hazey. Decent head, still lingering as I write this, but definately does not stick around forever. A little lacing as the head dissipates.  Smell. This is my favorite part of Celebration Ale. I think this one smells very sweet and also very earthy. This definately reminds me of cutting christmas trees, because of the ""pine"" scent. Hops, yes, but not as strong as I remember a year ago.  Taste. God I love the tase of this beer. It is fairly bitter but to me the taste is really does tast like the holidays. It is fairly bitter but not too much. The beer is also pretty sweet which is something I do not remember my first time around. I also taste the pine or earthy taste I was able to smell earlier.  Mouthfeel. This too is a feature of this beer that I absolutly love. It is pretty strongly carbonated which helps bring out the flavors of the beer. The carbonation is ""uplifting"" and fits perfectly with this beer as a whole.  Drinkability. If drinkability refers to the amount of beer that can be drank, this is not the beer for you. The flavor is very powerful and it would be impossible for me to drink a ton of these. I would rather drink this one slowly and enjoy the flavors because that is how I consider this beer to be drinkable. The beer is super dynamic, so it is definately best enjoyed in a slow and deliberate manner.  A Beer in Review. I think it is evident that I love this beer. The flavor is perfect for the season, and its availability sort of hypes up my excitement for the beer. The earthy flavors make this beer stand out, and it is a great choice for a nationally available seasonal brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smells of hops, cream, citrusy fruits.  Taste- Hops hit the sides of the mouth very noticeably, taste very fresh and earthy. Carbonation is perfect, not too much, but not subtle, either.

Very large amount of floral hops in my nose. Smells extremely fresh, although I can't find the freshness label. Maybe I'm just not looking hard enough. Whatever. It's the 2010 version, and in-season. It's fresh.  A bunch of biting hops on the palate. Actually let my less-inclined friend take a sip and he insisted it was way too bitter for him. Just what I like.  I bought a six-pack of this, and I'll be damned if I don't finish it this evening. That's a testament to the drinkability. I'll be feeling a nice little winter's buzz as I begin my slumber tonight, and I'll be thankful for the extra warmth.

Smells strongly of piny, oily hops, but is complemented by a light toasted malt character and a dash of spices. Taking a sip, the beer is very full-bodied and bursting with different flavors: an initial sweetness quickly subsides into a clean hop bitterness that is held up by a strong malt body, which is toasty but not dark. A hint of winter spices (allspice or cloves maybe?) adds another pleasant dimension. The mouthfeel is rich and chewy, with an ample bite, and the hops linger long after the beer has been put down. Still, the finish is clean and almost fruity.  A great, great beer and a perfect IPA for the colder months.

And should be applauded for being accessible and affordable in today's race to be the rarest and most expensive.  But the latest batch I am drinking (0278xxxx)sometimes gives me hints of phenolic character hiding behind the intensity of the hops. Just putting this out there in case others might have experienced this and are afraid to say so due to the overwhelming majority of excellent reviews.

Booming 4F of cream-colored head, over a clear but rich amber body - tons of carbonation present, and lots of sugary/sticky lacing.  You can smell the balance in the aroma. Not terribly strong on either side of the hops/malts equation, but inviting. Fresh tangerine peel comes to mind, along with caramel malts.  Good creaminess on the palate leads to western 'piney' hop flavors, with a touch of pineapple sweetness. Finish is nice and tight/dry.  Above average drinkability for an IPA. This is exactly the drinkability you'd want from a 6-7% IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,haddon,4.1,"pours a caramel copper with thick frothy white head. good looking beer  very well balanced on the nose. very sweet with orange and citrus on the front end followed with malts and light hint of alcohol  good balance continues on the palate. bitter hops, citrus, and almost a caramelized sugar just under the hops. the bitterness gets a little more pronounced on the aftertaste. nice.  medium body that provides a thick & rich feel  this is an incredibly drinkable beer. still can't believe this comes in at 6.8% abv. what a thirst quencher. wish it wasn't seasonal because I would stock up in the summertime.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,pburland23,4.32,"Poured from a 24 ounce bottle into a dimpled mug.  Pours a beautiful deep, coppery red with an thick, fluffy head that creates some amazing lacing.  The aroma is absolutely dominated by hops...piney hops. It's an wonderful characteristic of a winter seasonal. Cracking open a bottle of Celebration is like bringing your Christmas tree into the house.  The taste is also very heavy on hops. It's bittern and there is not a lot of malt to balance the beer out, but who cares? The hops bitterness is delightful through and through.  The mouthfeel is full, a little sticky at points. Very satisfying. For an IPA, the drinkability is amazing. Despite the ABV, I could see myself polishing off several of these this holiday season.  In the end, Celebration is a wonderful IPA and seasonal offering from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,garuda,4.1,"A - Clear copper with a one finger thick white head that has good retention and lacing down the glass.  S - Sweet toffee, caramel malts, with some earthy pine hops.  T - Spicy hops, then some caramel malt sweetness finishing with pine and floral hops.  M - Light side of a medium body, medium carbonation, smooth and creamy, with some hop oils left in the finish.  D - An all around good IPA, easy to drink with great balance.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PBoegel,4.28,"Comical in a way to be reviewing this beer at this point, but from the 2010 newly minted ""fresh hop ale"" packaged personal all time top 5 holiday beer category of reviews here is what I have to add about a beer that has been reviewed 2,400+ times.  Poured into a Sierra tulip pint, Celebration pours a light amber with touches of orange and red with a tight puffy cream white head. Year after year, this beer never fails to lace down the side of the glass with outstanding sugary glistening sticky foam.  The aroma upfront on celebration is one of rubbing fresh blue spruce needles in your hands, sappy and piny. There is always a substantial crisp clean biscuit like malt character with a touch of sugar cookie and faint caramel underneath. Following the spruce is lemon zest, grapefruit and orange peel.  The flavor profile is consistent with the nose but with a more pronounced citrus character vs the piny notes in the aroma. The malt profile is more prominent in the middle but the citrus hop notes are plentiful upfront and in the superb bittering finish.  The mouthfeel is medium light, with just a touch of sweetness to counter the aggressively bitter hop profile.  To call this beer anything less than exceptional in its drinkability would be a crime. The beer secret police will cry and release the hounds to dare mention the word ""session"" is there is apparently a law regarding the use of that term, but it is as close as it comes to a sessionable IPA.  Much is written about this beer year in and year out in the forums. From the mystery of ""spices"" to the BA who will undoubtedly claim the recipe has been changed. One thing is certain this is among the very best of and a classic Holiday Ale brewed in America and at one time before the bastardization of hops into alcohol delivery devices and vice versa, Celebration was the king of all hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,xnicknj,3.71,"12oz bottle poured into pint glass  Pours a hazed auburn with a nice frothed head. Fades into thick film with plenty of ringed lacing around the glass which lasts through the entire beer.  A burst of piny hops in the nose, coupled with some herbal notes and light malt flairs.  Begins with a nice dose of hops and pine, giving way to a light sweetness. The malt backbone is apparent, but not heavy, with tones of caramel and bread crust. Finishes with under-pronounced hoppiness, a hint of spice, and a bit of warmth.  Medium body, a little chewy, and some sticky feels. Drinks smooth and refreshing for sure. This isn't one of the best IPAs I've tasted at all, but it still manages to measure up pretty well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Fatehunter,3.95,"A - Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Amber color, transparent with a big inch and half of white head.  S - I smell hops, but it is not the citrus scent that normally goes with the hops. Unique smell for an IPA and in a good way.  T - A little malty at the beginning but hops quickly take over. It ends with a nice biting bitterness.  M - Crisp and light body at first, followed by a little softer texture. Moderate to higher carbonation. Now, after a few drinks of this the carbonation is a bit annoying.  D - A good IPA. As a winter seasonal I tend to pick maltier beers over hoppy ones, but that is just a personal preference.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beancounter,4.4,"Poured into a pint glass from a bomber. 2010 batch.  A-Medium amber. Numerous slow bubbles, about a 1/2 finger head, and lacing as I drink it.  S-primarily floral with some hints of citrus.  T-Nice moderate hoppiness, more floral flavors, but subtle.  M-Medium body  D-Very drinkable. It goes down smoothly , but also has plenty of substance to keep you interested.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,gopens44,4.3,"A - crystal clear, straw in color and a moderately funtime frothy head that wasn't very shy.  S - Very nice. The hop presence comes across in a very earthy manner. Very much reminded me of a soggy forest, but in a really good way.  T - Taste was fresh crisp and rich with a well balanced hop bite.  M - Again, crisp. Well carbonated and not much aftertaste.  Very pleasant beer from our friends in Chico.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,brunop,5,"5.0 all around. there's not much i can add to the accolades of this 2010 release.  so i guess i'm just chiming in.  tremendous hops. just tremendous! V. TREMENDOUS!!!! my only ""criticism"" is that SN should make this a year-round brew. but i guess torpedo is their hop hound. and it wouldn't be celebration if this brew was all year round. but the ""celebration"" ale each year makes the new england winter easier to bear for sure!  and kudos and all dap to SN for charging a fair price.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Axic10,4.1,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  Appearance: Pours copperish with a finger of fluffy off white foam.  Smell: Earthy, piney and citrusy hops, with some malt on the back of the nose.  Taste: Similar to the nose, very hop forward with earth, piney and citrusy flavors. The crisp aftertaste contains some malt flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and very crisp.  Drinkability: Extremely drinkable beer (big surprise from Sierra Nevada, *sarcasm*) that I get my fill of each and every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,zhanson88,4.28,"Appearance: Celebration pours a very nice copper color with orange highlights. Slight carbonation is apparent, and there is a couple fingers of off-white lacing. Retention is decent, and the lacing is tight and clings all over the glass.  Smell: Just a bit of caramel maltiness makes up the backbone, but this beer is dominated by citrus and piney hops. This is a nice, crisp and refeshing smell.  Taste: I get a hint of caramel malts up front, but then citrus and pine come in waves. It has a hoppy, bitter finish that is just about right for an IPA. Nothing real complex, this is a no-frills beer that is about spot on for the style.  Mouthfeel: This beer has superb feel. Medium bodied with fairly low carbonation, it combines for a slightly syrupy mouthfeel and bitterness that lingers in the mouth. Very nice.  Drinkability: Through the roof. Good taste, great mouthfeel and relatively low ABV combine to make this beer among the most drinkable I have tried. Definitely recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Takahiro,3.39,"tulip glass for evaluation  A: Tan/light brown, clear, with thick off-white 3"" sticky foam.  S: Dank marijuana, malty wort, caramel, brown sugar  T: Strong hop flavor, which interplays with thick malt in the beginneing. The malt flavor loses its battle to the hoppiness shortly after, and the hop flavor lingers on for a while. A quite while, but pleasantly so.  M: fully mouthfull of maltiness. Hop flavor cuts well into this sticky malt. Sticky.  D: Not so well. The flavor sticks to the palate and makes it tired after few sips.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Phelps,3.68,"Enjoyed on tap at Papago. Served in a standard pint glass.  Looks: poofy. A one-finger head of pillowy light khaki billows above the rim of the glass and recedes very slowly, hanging out for a good ten minutes. The beer itself is a perfectly clear medium copper. The remaining layer of foam grips the sides of the glass in snowy sheets.  Smells: sweet. Caramel, cotton candy and a smooth floral character akin to roses or orange blossoms. It's sweeter than it is citrusy, but there is some subdued tangerine here.  Tastes: toastier than expected. Lots of biscuits and crackers, sharp orange peel and a lightly sweet caramel character. There's also floral rose and lavender before a grainy finish.  Feels: medium light in body with a light yet prickly carbonation. It's smooth, crisp and lightly fizzy as it moves about.  Drinks: like a celebration in my mouth. Sierra Nevada's winter IPA isn't their best, and it doesn't have any of the wintery spiciness that some expect. But it's a decent brew, and one that should be on anyone's winter beer list.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,chumba526,3.77,"Appears dark orange with a sizable white head.  Smells quite citrus like, there is a pine smell and a caramel smell as well. I also get a slight floral smell going on as well.  It tastes quite like it smelt. There are strong citrus flavors. I get a strong grapefruit flavor. There is a dank pine smell going on. There is a strong malt caramel present as well. There is a substantial hoppy bitterness in the finish of the beer. It is a pretty well balanced IPA.  The carbonation is moderate medium. It is about average for the style.  The drinkability is decent I could drink two of these no problem but would not want to drink more than two.  Overall a nice IPA that is better than most though it is not amazing. A great IPA for the price though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T-Hoppy at first, mostly piney hops, and then finishing with a nice toasty maltiness. It tastes much more toasty and malty than from the bottle, which surprised me. Still it tasted delicious.  M-Slightly thick with a nice amount of carbonation.  D-This was incredibly balanced making very drinkable. Its absolutely delicious and I could drink it about all day.  Overall, I was really excited about trying this beer on tap. While it was much different than I expected, it was still exceptional. This is one of those beers that you should never turn down a chance to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,woodychandler,4.65,"2010 Fresh Hop Ale iteration. I think that I am going to do some ticking for a little while and get all of my numbers to the 400 range.  From the bottle: ""Celebration Ale is a special ale for the holidays. Featuring the first hops of the growing season, this pioneering IPA is full of complex flavors and aromas from the generous use of whole cone American hops.""  I am wildly out of practice when it comes to pouring from a bottle, vice a CAN. Once the panic of a near-overflow subsided, I was looking at a rocky two fingers' worth of light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose was both earthy and piney, like being out in the forest and taking a deep breath. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with an immediate burst of very piney hops on the tongue. Man, this is the kind of thing that caused me to become a hophead in the first place! Great Gaddang, but this was right in my skewed wheelhouse. It's a good thing that I liked it, since I bought a gigantor 24-ounce bottle and I could not find anyone to share it with me. Boo hoo. The finish swept through with a minty chill that really sent shivers up and down my spine. Peering into my glass, I took note of some lovely sticky lacing that looked like Jack Frost had been at work. A second, warmer pour released a really earthy aroma, like I had been out digging around in my backyard. I liked just letting it roll around on my tongue since the hops did not have a heavy bite, but more of a wintergreen flavor. Only $3.95 for this?!? A freakin' bargain and worth revisiting, if I could get people to come over/have me over.  Today is MLK Day, M, 15 Jan 2018 & I have both a bottle & a CAN of 2017 for a side-by-side, back-to-back review!  First, from the bottle: ""A special ale for the holidays, Celebration IPA features the first hops of the growing season. This pioneering ale is full of complex flavors and aromas from the generous use of whole-cone American hops.""; ""We first brewed Celebration IPA in the winter of 1981. Each year, we use only the first fresh hops of the growing season to create this complex and robust ale. Layered pine and citrus hop aromas balance delicately against rich, malt sweetness to shape this bold wintertime classic.""; ""We brew in Chico, CA and Mills River, NC, to bring you the finest quality beer.""  In this instance, I only (ha!) had a 12-fl. oz. bottle, but I did not want to do anything more than Pop! the cap & do a gentle pour into the awaiting glass. I really liked that it was very low-maintenance, forming a one-finger cap of dense, foamy, tawny head all on its own without any outside assistance. Color was a beautiful Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was filled with pine resin cut with freshly-squeezed lemons & grapefruits. 8=O Mouthfeel was medium. I had it a tad cold, coming straight outta the reefer so I allowed it to simply roll around on my tongue & warm up a bit. This = IT! I was complaining recently that modern southern hemisphere hops are being used in AIPAs to impart tropical fruit flavors, but an AIPA should be more bitter. No problem here as the citrus flavors made a cutting, biting swath over my tongue that the cool pine mintiness salved over. Mmmm. I was higher than average on my original, unchanged score, but I am tempted to go even higher after this one. And it was out of a bottle! I CAN't wait for what is coming next! Finish was dry, bitter, citrusy, dank and very mellow.  From the CAN: ""Family owned, operated & argued over"". That's it?!? Bottle gets the initial nod, at least in this regard. Information, that's the name of the game!  Oh, well, nowt for it but a Crack! & gentle Glug to keep things equal. The head rose of its own accord to form a brief finger of foamy, tawny head, but it quickly fell away. Color was again Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, < 17), but it seemed a tad brighter than from the bottle. Mind you, that is not my CAN bias speaking, but it was button-bright in this iteration. Nose was really pine-y now, like walking into a cut-yer-own Christmas tree lot with sap everywhere. I kid you not, no citrus notes at all, but an abundance of pine! Mmm. I toasted my drinking companion, Kenny, a now-deceased shipmate who routinely shows up in my kitchen to watch me drink, and took my first draught. Mouthfeel was medium, all things being equal. OMFG, who filled my mouth with pine oil?!? This was like Yards' first iteration of Poor Richard's Tavern Spruce in which they did not know how much of spruce tips was too much but they quickly learned! Phew. I have an affinity for the coolness of pine/spruce in an IPA, but this was like menthol! Finish was extremely cool & dry. Permafrost, anyone? Wow! In a CAN!  I am going to declare this one a tie since both had their merits.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kneeland,2.28,"I thought this was going to be a winter ale, since the bottle never said anything about it being an IPA. But even with being surprised, I didn't like anything about it.  Very barky with a wanna be cinnamon taste. Tasted very flat and chalky. The head disappeared quickly, and it's too heavy to drink fast enough. Just very bad mouthfeel.  I was excited to have it with my Thanksgiving dinner, but I actually had to switch to Bud Light instead. Yea, I know.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,chchchchia,4.43,"My first review, so I figured I'd start with a historically great beer.  2010 version  A - A deep amber with a massive head that seems to last for forever, leaving a thick lacing along the glass, even while drunk slowly. S - Hops beautiful hops. Malt is there, but only as an accent. T - Malt more than covered up with piney hops. A sharp bitterness follows. The malt seems to only amplify the hop bitterness. M - med to high carbonation. Not smooth at all, but then again, this is an IPA. D - For a hophead, this is very drinkable. Not heavy, just bitter.  This is a great beer for those in love with big, hoppy, and overall, bitter IPAs. It's not as finely balanced as the Dogfish Head 90 or Bell's Two Hearted, but I don't think that's the point. This is a fine beer to sip on a cold night when other, super malty warmers have got you down, or if you've just got a craving for a super bitter IPA that doesn't slap you in the face with hops. A great beer, one it seems is designed for aging.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BeerLover99,4.3,"A - orange/amber body, finger head, terrific lacing.  S - floral, grassy, pine aroma.  T - grassy, lemon zest, pine, malt, low sticky slow bitter finish  M - med. body, oily/sticky mouth  O: Reviewed this time last year and thought it was just ok, but glad I gave it another go. Perhaps, I got a bad bottle/batch/or my palate was just in a funk. I'm glad I went back to this beer; by FAR, my favorite Sierra Nevada beer.  DELICIOUS, TREAT YOURSELF!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beachbum1975,3.89,"Happy Thanksgiving!  I've had this beer on multiple occasions from multiple years and never reviewed it. I'm about to watch the Bengals lose the Jets, so I figured it was time to review this one.  2010 Celebration into a traditional pint glass.  Pours a clear, burnt orange with a nice, big a frothy head. Great, sticky lacing and excellent head retention. Very nice looker.  Light grapefruit, some minor lactic qualities and sweet malts. Overall, minimal aroma on the nose.  Fresh and lightly bittering grapefruit essence. Fresh earthy hops (mild dirt and vegetable like freshness). Nice malt backbone.  Great mouthfeel for an IPA with moderate bitterness and high carbonation. Easy to drink.  Your quintessential fresh hopped IPA. A World class example in consistency.

140,1904,Briken,4.15,"Bright, clear red/orange with huge foamy heat with good retention and lacing. Pine and spicy sweet aroma. Peppery sweet taste with a nice pine hop finish and nice sweet malt background. Full flavored with a hint of almost peppermint. Smooth, well carbonated mouthfeel.  An interesting winter beer selection in an IPA. I guess winter beers aren't just malty anymore. It has great flavor with nice balance although it's hard for me to give up my malty winter warmer. As an IPA it is wonderful and as a winter beer it certainly has holiday flavors built right in.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dragonWhale,4.21,"the classic.. clear amber with ample head. As the foam billowed up in my chalice, I could actually smell first the intense harsh bitterness of Chinook, followed by some malt and oranges. she's bitter yet sweet, wild yet classy. the balance is exceptional, as the chinook is not left to hang over your tongue for too long before the hops' sins are washed away by the caramel sweetness. The big citrus is accentuated by a bit of the pine and floral. It feels good, and I do love the timing of the release. Usually by now I've started drifting away from IPAs (a bit) for the season but this is a reminder of the good times that grow on the bines. I feel like I'm in Yakima all over again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,3HovsepiansBrews,4.13,"A - A beautiful hazy orange with an off-white head.  S - A clean, fresh hop aroma that is a little sweet and a bit floral.  T - The first taste you get is the fruitiness (citrus) from the hops, which turns into an herbal (almost tea-like) flavor. Finally you get a really nice bitter hop flavor that coats your mouth and throat.  M - Medium body and well carbonated make this beer feel really nice.  D - Considering the crisp cleanliness of the hops and the subtle herbal and fruity flavors and low abv, I could definitely drink many of these in a session.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Scent is DELICIOUS hoppy goodness with just a bit of malt. A lot of pine and grapefruit aromas. Taste is very delightful. It reminds me of a very fresh Torpedo with a bit more malt character. At first I get some pine, followed by grapefruit and sweet apricot flavors. Then followed by some hop bitterness with a bit of caramel malt. Very well-balanced IMO. Mouthfeel is nice and full bodied with great carbonation. Drinkability is very high. I could see why people would complain about having an IPA as a Christmas/Winter ale, but I have no complaints.

Citrus, pine, grass on the nose. Nothing that blows my hair back.  Taste is all unriped grapefuit and pine. Incredibly unbalanced. Zero malt backbone to balance the bitter hop profile. Yuck.  Bitter grapefruit taste lingers far too long. Can't wait to have a different beer once this one is done. Am not impressed at all. I love IPAs but this one just lacks any balance.

Mild IPA or maybe an IPA with hops that are different from some I've had before. Not sure but good. The label says ""first hops of the season"" called full cone American hops. This is the 2010 bottle. Bubbly on the tongue with the initial sip. Bitter up front, pine, floral in the middle, mellows out into some sweet malt at the end. Nice aftertaste of hop and malt.

Nice lacing around the glass. Smells of faint herbal hops, brown sugar and caramel. It almost smells more like a barley wine than an IPA, but it is from 2009 so that isn't surprising. Flavour is quite sweet, still enough bitterness though. Carbonation level is nice. I would like to try this fresh someday.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - Fresh, clean hop bouquet packs a pleasant wallop, tons of orange juice, grapefruit pith and pine resin. Caramel malt provides the balance. T - Again, the hops dominate, very fresh and crisp with more orange, grapefruit and pine resin. Caramel/toffee malts smooth out the hop bite, but the finish is rather bitter (in a good way). Flavor and bitterness lingers on the palate for some time. Delicious! M - Very creamy mouthfeel with a medium body and medium-high, crisp carbonation. D - Drinkability is off the charts for me, I blew through this Sixer pretty quickly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,climax,4.28,"2010 version: Fresh from Sacramento  It pours a fairly murky burnt orange/copper color with a pretty massive solid foam head. The retention and lace notches are excellent.  The nose is bold but by no means pungent or brutally hoppy. The hop bouquet is fresh and clean to say the least, sporting fresh cut grass and juicy orange citrus notes. The malt backbone has a respectable presence, keeping in the background but not letting the hops run away.  The flavor follows the same trend as the nose, but with the added intensity I was hoping for. The flavors really flirt with each-other nicely. Fresh juicy hops up front have orange, pine, and grass flavors. Into the finish, toasty malt, a kiss of sweetness and spice surface before being burnt in the end by grapefruit esters.  The feel is very creamy and body is really pretty thick. The carbonation is fairly mild, but perfect in my eyes with this much viscosity. It's a beautifully fresh and clean IPA, has all of the qualities I think a good one should posses.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,KickInTheChalice,4.03,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Celebration pours an copper amber color, slightly hazy with a 4 cm off-white head with a sea foam consistency. Great lacing sticks all over the glass.  Smell: Quite a bitter hop aroma, some citrus but mostly floral. Caramel malt in the background. A bit of sticky pine as well.  Taste: It starts out with a nice soft malt flavor, just a bit sweet. Bitter hops step in, with some sticky pine, grapefruit, and floral hop flavors stepping in. The bitterness really builds, and by the finish is quite strong, lingering well after the sip has finished.  Mouthfeel: Overall there is a great creamy smoothness, and it is a touch grainy. It never really gets to a juicy level before finishing a little bit dry.  Drinkability: The bitterness in the end lingers a bit, but this is an enjoyable brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,AdamBear,4.65,"A-medium amber with a good amount of cream colored head  S-oh yes..it smells beautiful. its smells like sweet sugary hops. its just smells...comfortable to me. its a good strong scent. i smell vanilla in there as well for some reason.  T-its definitely good, but its a bit of a let down after that aroma. it hits with a good amount of creamy hops that quickly fades in to a great amount of bitterness. some may like this but its not my thing. i think IPAs are best really hoppy with a minimal amount of bitterness....this beer just doesn't have the right balance to it.  M-really good creamy carbonation that finishes surprisingly dry  D-well its not that terrible of a drinker. I got a 6 pack and i'm sure to drink a few of them at a time and even tho the taste didn't fair amazingly well with me, i'm excited to have some more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S- Pine hops, citrus tones, buttered popcorn  T- Toffee background with lots of pine, hops, and citrus driving. Fresh hops leads this beer.  M- Light, crisp, clean. Buttery with a dry finish.  D- The hops lingers after the dry finish. Very fresh and refreshing beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RonaldTheriot,4.42,"Sierra Nevada Celebration has a very thick, frothy, off-white head, and a clear amber appearance. Carbonation is moderate to high, and the aroma is of pine and hop oil. Taste is excellent, with a hop preponderance, and maybe a faint citrus aspect. Barley flavor really doesn't play a role with this beer. Mouth-feel is light and watery, and Sierra Nevada Celebration finishes very satisfying and wet. I would rather have enjoyed some barley notes with this, due to my preference for it, and the ale is pretty one dimensional, but this is not a complaint. Overall, this is an outstanding ale. I love it.  RJT",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mbusster88,4.41,"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass.  A: Wonderful amber color with tan head. Large bubbles in the head, which is not dissipating to quickly. Absolutely the most carbonation I have ever seen, so many bubbles coming off the glass it looks like a snow globe.  S: Great astringent smell, with citrus and pine notes. Tons of great fresh hop aromas with the citrus style bite in the nose.  T/M: Very nice hop bite up front, gets malty in the middle and finishes dry with the hop flavor lingering. Great smooth taste and well defined. Great balance makes this a very drinkable beer, hard to keep in the glass. The freshness of the hops makes the flavors very robust and clean. Love the palate cleansing feeling with this one.  D: This beer is meant for celebrating! This one is easy to drink, with big flavor and no let downs. Another wonderful beer from SN!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Daniellobo,4.16,"Nice seasonal IPA, rather fresh and rich.  Presentation: 12 oz brown capped bottle. Festive red Sierra Nevada seal label, snowed house in the mountains surrounded by poinsettias in the framing. Brief neck label describing the composition, and intent of the brew. Shows release date as 2010. Notes Alc. by Vol. (6.8%) Poured into a tulip glass.  A - Faintly hazy medium amber pour with a towering rich frothy head, superb retention, nice surface memory and lacing.  S - Pleasing nose, not too assertive but with a nice fresh hoppy sense. grapefruit with a dash of resin and perfume.  T -Taste offers a nice hoppy range, citrus and resin, pine, maybe some light spice woven with the bitter touch. Nice malt in the back with a caramel touch.  M - Medium to medium-light body with low carbonation that works rather well, and a creamy sense leading to the soft hoppy bite with some dryness.  D - Very easy and pleasing flow. Looking to open another as I type...

140,1904,begforme4484,3.83,"Pours a darker amber with a brown hue. 2 fingers of off white head that doesn't like to go down. Chunky thick lacing on the glass.  Smells of spicy hops, and sugary malts.  Taste is of strong hops. Not overly bitter though. A nice spiciness on the tongue, and earthy hop kick and a nice lingering slight bitterness. Not much malt to speak of, but I'm not complaining.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lingering, and nice carbonation.  Drinkability is good. I like the uniqueness of it being a seasonal, end of hops season, IPA. It seems to extract a much different focus from the hops. Much more earthy and spicy, a nice beer. Cheap cost too!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RickS95,4.3,"A little darker than a normal IPA, looks like you mixed orange juice and ginger ale. A thin, but fluffy white head that sticks to the glass as it dissipates.  Has a flowery, citrusy smell, and seemed to have a scent of hard candy as well.  A big taste of citrus greets you with each sip. A little bit of pine is present as well.  The malts do a good job of masking the bitterness. It's still there, but it's gentle makes each drink enjoyable.  Like all things Sierra Nevada, this is a keeper. Good flavors, good alcohol, just a shame it's a seasonal.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Kitt,4.11,"Bottle to pint glass, a rich brick red with an ivory two-finger head that persists.  Aroma of strong hops and spices with a malty background.  Dense bitter hops and spices. Bitter taste lingers. These hops kick, and kick, and kick! Lingering as long as the frothy lace. Spices a rather unique peppery flavor. I'm not picking up much malt backbone here as the hops & spices are overwhelming. In general, I favor a hop flavor a wee bit more eclectic; although strong and bitter as I like, hop flavor is slighly monotonous.  Mouthfeel is rich and thick. Goes down very smooth.  Drinkability is excellent. Alcohol is prevalent and indeed warming, but the smooth nature of the beer and spiced bitter flavor keeps one wanting.  Overall, an excellent holiday brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beerdown77,4.95,"This ambrosial brew is truly the ""nectar of the gods"". It's one of my favorite beers because it is not overwhelmingly seasonal in taste. It doesn't have any weird, funky spiciness that guides you down a path of regret half way through. It is super refreshing and crisp; I think I could enjoy one of these in the summer. I pick up some pinyness. Thats right, pine, and do I taste poinsettias and sprigs of holly? No, those are just on the bottle. The big head lasts all the way to the end...great overall appearance. The subtle approach to this being a seasonal beer makes it awesome and drinkable. Plan to have a couple of these in a row, no problem.

140,1904,aasher,4.18,"This one pours a light bodied auburn in color with a light off white head that sits atop the brew. It is light and well carbonated, releasing bubbles from the bottom of the brew the entire session. It smells very dry and hoppy and has a little musk to it. It drinks like dry, very dry and gives me cotton mouth. It's very hoppy but not piny or citrusy. I'd say it's better than the Sierra Pale. It drinks very crisp and light bodied. I like this one.

A: Pours a crisp reddish/amber. Two-finger head and great lacing around the glass. Carbonation originating from one point at the bottom of the glass. Looks like smoke rising from a chimney.  S: Fresh hops and spices. Actually pretty earthy -- smells like a pine forest in the fall.  T: Spicy. Lots of hops. Slightly piney.  M: Warming sensation and bitter aftertaste.  D: Good beer for a cold, cloudy day. Looking forward to drinking more of this beer in the coming months.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Chaney,4.26,"Nothing gets me more in the mood for the Christmas season than this brew!  A: Poured a beautiful mildly cloudy, Christmas red, with a whopping three finger + off-white head, that stayed part of the brew's culture throughout the session.  S: Wowsers, the dry-hopping gave this thing a truly awesome flair. Chinook as the bittering agent, combined with Sierra's hop profile was miraculous!  T: The bitterness really hit the tongue hard on the front of this brew, then the thick, full-bodied flavor, with chock full of hoppy goodness (Cascade and Centennial) flood the palate in a truly delightful way. The tempered sweetness is perfect here!  M: The bitterness was not unpleasant in any way, and it set up the floral component very nicely. The carbonation was bubbly and perfect for the style.  D: Hmmm.... which on is better - Torpedo or this one? Since it's been a few months since I've had the former, and I honestly don't remember it being this good, I'm going to go with Celebration.

140,1904,cmq103,4.1,"I just tapped this at the home basement bar along with a Magic Hat Circus Boy. It's always good to have a lighter beer for the non-hop head beer drinkers who don't appreciate a mighty fine American IPA.  A: The tap pour was a reddish copper color with a nice frothy head that clung to the side of the glass with ease.  S: I'll first start off by saying they should make an air freshener that smells like this. A great hoppy pine aroma with mild citrus background.  T: Just as great as the smell. Medium hoppy bite with piney-grapefruit flavors that roll of the tongue with a mild, dry bitterness at the end. An easy-drinking beer with tons of flavor.  M: Smooth mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation.  D: I agree that this is a highly anticipated winter seasonal. I get a 1/6th keg every year as soon as it becomes available. This could be a little dangerous though with the 6.8 % ABV and easy drinkability. I think it's much better on tap then from a bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Psilo707,3.87,"Bought this as a great $6.99 deal at the local market. Knew it would be a good purchase from the start. Poured into a 20 oz mug, it foams nicely with quality head. The beer itself sparkles in the glass. Quite a bit of bubbles, which reside dormant when mug is shaken up a bit.  Smell is fruity - more fruity than the beer actually is; good thing. Very deep aroma, like sniffing a book from an attic that you haven't seen in a decade. With boysenberries on top. Hell yes.  Taste is just like it smells, just a bit more oakey and not as much fruit, Like it a lot. Deep taste, as the scent was. Can dig it in every way.  Mouthfeel is alright but not quite as solid as I'd expect. The taste hits you so fast that you can't really enjoy it in the mouth for longer than a few seconds. The drinkability is high - cleared a 6 pack and felt GRRREAT to the end!  Overall, Recommended.  12oz (355ml) bottle from a 6-pack purchased at Ryan's Party Store in Port Huron, MI. Pours a slightly hazed copper bronze with a thick ring of cream coloured head. Globs of stringy lace cling to the tulip. Subdued nose is floral hops, Clementine, citrus zest, and fruity, toffee-like aromas. Taste is orange peel, pine, caramel, bright and juicy tangerine, and a spicy, citric hop bitterness to end. Mouthfeel is silky, medium-bodied, oily texture mid-palate, crisp and tangy bite from the hops with a firmly bitter finish.  Big, satisfying flavours on this holiday IPA but I'm not detecting the cinnamon taste that others have noted. And that makes sense to me since Celebration doesn't have any spices added to it. High drinkability as I could easily pack back a sixer over an evening or two, but because this isn't available around here I'll be limiting myself to one bottle per night. I look forward to savouring the rest of my half case over the next two weeks.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A nice blend of floral and citrus hop aromas with a hint of sweet malt beneath. Medium bodied with pleasant carbonation. A wonderfully smooth and drinkable beer. Complex hop flavors in the beginning, apple and citrus flavors mixed with malt sweetness that slowly taper s to a bitter, hoppy pine finish that slowly fades away.

The thing won't die down and it clings to the glasss wonderfully. The beer itself is a clear light amber and looks fantastic.  The nose is hops, hops and hops. Can't really get much more out of it.  The taste is much more balanced than the nose. The crystal malt is bold and rich. The hops have good flavor and aren't overpowering. Very easy to sip down and it has good weight in my mouth.

Smell: Strong citrus notes are most prevalent, as they are in the taste. Light traces of that alcoholy sweetness found it most IPAs.  Taste: Citrus hops all through the malty textures. Starts with a pleasant fresh hop blend and ends with it as well.  Mouthfeel: Not a strong malt presence but what little it has does limit the hops from overpowering the mouth. The citrus notes are felt from the front to the back.  Drinkability: The hops are very noticeable but enjoyable nonetheless. Definitely something I would like to try again on tap but not something I would make a night of.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A: A great looking beer that had a nice slightly off white head. Very clear amber/copper colors.  S: I could smell this all day long. Had a nice sweet spice to it.  T: I think it was the hops, but it tasted way too bitter for me. Not an awful product, but there was too much bitterness for me.  M: Had a little bit more carbonation than I like.

Color is a 16 on the SRM beer color chart. I detect fragrances of lime, orange, lemon, green tea, and hops. Very flavorful. Heavy on the citrus, sour side, but good tastes, of lemon, orange, lime, and of course hops. Lots of body in my mouth, like heavy cream, but much cleaner after feel. I waited for this for better than a month since the talk was out that it had hit the shelves in other places. I guess South Georgia is one of the last stops.

The look of the thing is nice enough, huge fluffy head, lovely lacing, a hazy reddish orange. A bit too dark, but not really bad. The aroma though...light, bright citrus, and some spicier, piney notes along with caramel malty sweetness, but I have to really sniff into the tulip, the hops don't burst forth like I expect a fresh hop IPA to do.  The taste is pleasant enough, orange and grapefruit hop citrus, some faint resin and pine with some spice and a light caramel malt sweetness, but no real punch, nothing really stands out. It's nice, but kind of forgetable, even between sips.  The mouthfeel is nice though, very full, and highly carbonated. Finishes with a nice mix of bitterness and a light sweetness that doesn't linger long enough to become cloying.  It's drinkable, goes down easy, and is a nice enough beer to drink while watching TV or some other situation where you don't really care to have what your drinking be the main focus of your concentration.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,heartofgold,2.46,"Reviewed is a 12oz bottle, labeled ""2010 Celebration Fresh Hope Ale""  Poured this into a pint glass. Minimal head was created which dissipated rather quickly. The color was a clear bronze amber.  The aroma was very mild, with a hint of pine, very subtle for a fresh hop IPA.  The taste was of toasted malt with an element of burnt chocolate and pine, with a medium bitter-hop finish. The lack of aroma seemed to hold back any complexity in the taste.  This is a moderately drinkable beer. I'm a big fan of SN but this didn't hit the mark for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Mild aroma for an IPA definitely got the citrusy thing going though...  tastes like a grapefruit tree mated with a cacao tree that was in the sun too long...enjoyable!  Surprisingly with all that's going here the feel of this beer is excellent. Not overwhelming hop wise and none of the cloy sweetness some Winter beers have...that said I know it is an IPA and this beer knows it too!  It's so enjoyable I'm gonna drink a few more! Very good for the style. A sort of Christmas IPA. This beer was born the same time I was and I bet it was a game changer back then.

140,1904,Bouleboubier,4.22,"Glad I revisited this one! Sierra Nevada, say what you will, makes some damn fine IPAs. But this doesn't come across as your ""typical"" (if that word can even be applied to the style...) IPA. The look and feel, I would offer, say English ale to me. Appearance-wise, it pours with healthy enough finger-width head, done and out. The hazy mahogany color is straight outta Comptonshire.  I went nutty trying to place the aroma until I figured out (or decided) that it had to simply be that of the oils of ultra-fresh hop flowers - from vine to kettle, no middle man. References for what the hops smell and taste like, however, eludes me. There seems to be this magical blend of floral, pine, and citrus - the ratio I'm dumbfounded to discern - with not one scent dominating. A fascinating blend, but too much straining to capture an ideal whiff.  The feel I cannot say enough about - deceptively smooth and satisfying, cask-like, but with a nicely-balanced, strangely appealing carbonic bite just prior to the moderately dry finish. Great crystal malt and English-style malt presence in the flavor as well as that confounding hop bouquet. I wouldn't say I got a significant dose of fruity or herby flavors anywhere. A unique, refined, and tasty concoction. I could easily stumble into a session with this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Eriktheipaman,3.59,This bottle comes in at 24 ounces rather than the standard bomber which is nice.  Pours a beautiful amber which is my favorite part of this brew. Also a nice head that stays all the way down.  The smell is kind of faint but pretty sweet of only hops.  The taste is bitter whith no to little malt backing. Piney with a dry finish.  This beer is good but doesnt do a whole lot for me. Id much prefer Torpedo or SNPA.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,yeahnatenelson,3.51,"Appearance -- Pours a brassy orange hue - rosy in the heart, gold around the edges -- with two fingers of stiff beige foam. Thick bands of lace as the head mellows.  Smell -- Bright and bitter: Pine resin, earthy vegetation, and grapefruit pith. Toasted malt, dab of honey, drop of cane juice. Nothing off, though a bit ho-hum.  Taste -- More bright grapefruit hop notes in the taste than in the nose - pith and zest. Pine resin also very present, crescendos in the finish. Sturdy malt backbone, more than just a jumping off point to the hops - toasty with mild malt sweetness akin to dark honey. Lingering flavors of resin, pith, and honey.  Mouthfeel -- Medium-light in body with nice carbonation. Works well with the flavor profile. Immensely drinkable.  Drinkability - Not bad in the least. Very balanced, though still definitely an IPA.

The bar I had this at is very dark, so it's hard to describe the color exactly; the beer seemed reddish copper with brilliant clarity and a dense off white head with good retention and nice, sticky lacing.  The nose was very disappointing. I thought I smelled some pine but cannot be sure, and that's about it. The taste was better, however: There was a decent malt backbone that manifested itself in the body but added little flavor and taste-wise hops ruled. Earthy, but with a citrusy zing to it, that seemed to get enhanced with rising temperature of the beer.  The finish wasn't the driest but was still very clean and massively bittering. A very well done combination of malts and *dominating* hops but not as good smelling as it tastes. Not the most refreshing beer but with the the right body and carbonation for an AIPA.

Smell: Invigorating grapefruit citrus, but it is no warning of excessive hoppiness ahead. Sweet caramel malts and molasses give the aroma a nice balance, and there is a little pine spice as well. There are also scents of orange peels and cherries.  Taste: Much toastier than the smell leads on, which is very pleasing. Grapefruit citrus up front followed by the malts: sweet caramel, molasses, and a little bit of chocolate. Backing the malts is pine spice and orange peels. A pleasant hop bitterness lingers in the aftertaste.  Drinkability: This is really good stuff. Not only does it have bite, but it also has a very well-balanced malt quality to keep it from going over the bitterness edge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,nniicckkww,4,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a chilled glass at a local pizza place. I was very hungry and thirsty.  The beer is very clear and had a nice head that left a proper lacing on the glass. Good pine/malt aroma but I didn't take more than a small sniff. Very satisfying after my first giant gulp. Dry, spicy hops. Very balanced. Exactly what I needed. This beer basically drank itself. I would have ordered another, but the bartender already had my check for me as I had a to-go food order. Delicious. However, seems to have less hoppy bite than the past years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Flightoficarus,4.32,"Haven't had this one in a while now, but snatched some up now that I see it's out again. Had to give it a revisit!  A - Pours a deep, amber-ruby hue that is semi-transparent, with a mild off-white head that quickly gives way to thin lacing.  S - Smell is of caramel, molasses, cinnamon & nutmeg, with orange and cherry, and very slight pine from the hops. You can tell right off the bat that this is a different kind of IPA.  T - A fantastic blend of the aforementioned smells! Caramel, nutmeg, various citrus fruits, cherry, and pine are the most abundant flavors. Bitterness is medium. Finish is slightly dry, leaving you wanting more.  M - Beer has a medium body-feel to it, with moderate carbonation, and a slightly slick, oily texture to it (hop oils)  D - Not on sessioning level, but most excellent for a few of to kick back and relax on a cool fall or winter day to!  Overall - An excellent IPA from SN, and I now remember why I loved this one so much when I first tried it. It's definitely going to be a regular in my fridge while it's available!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Notes of citrus, pear and pine with malt and caramel sweetness. Fairly straight forward but very nice.  Taste is a rich caramel sweetness, some maltiness and lots of hop flavor. Hops are grassy, citrusy, fruity and piney. Toward the finish this ale is a little dry, but in a pleasant and crisp way. The finish leaves lingering hop bitterness and some citrus with mild malt sweetness with some caramel. Overall this beer is full-flavored and crisp.  Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with above average carbonation.  Overall this beer is a nice IPA with a strong malt backbone and a nice balance of flavors, it is not as juicy as many IPAs but has a very rich feeling to it and plenty of hop character.

140,1904,Boitnott,3.98,"Served in a glass from the bottle.  A: This beer is a light brick color. Looks like caramel. You can pretty much see right through it. The foam was about an inch and it is cream colored and loose. The carbonation rises up straight from the bottom middle of the class. This looked really cool, not sure if its the beer or the glass.'  S: The strong hop smell prevails in this beer. As soon as I opened the bottle I could smell. You can also smell some of the spices.  T: This beer has everything an IPA should have and much more. The nose is actually sweet. It almost tastes like cinnamon or nutmeg. If you hold it in your mouth than the taste becomes more apparent. The finish has a strong IPA hop taste. It goes very well with the other flavors and will make you crave that next sip. Even the foam tastes good!  M: Despite the relatively large amount of foam, the beer is still online a little carbonated. It is not enough to take away from the taste of the beer at all.  D: Before this beer, I was unaware that IPAs could fall in the winter seasonal area. This beer is slightly darker than an IPA and makes me want to buy a bottle on Christmas Eve and hang out.

140,1904,ManuelHerrera,3.89,"Got this on cask at Sierra Nevada's 30th anniversary at The Surly Goat and I have to say... it was all right. I wasn't blown away by this year's offering, but it was a pleasant experience still. Maybe that's the free pint glass talking.  Poured with a massive head and beautiful lacing with a murky golden tint - I have to admit the pour was promising. The beer isn't particularly pungent - just some light citrus notes and a hint of pine (or holly, for the season).  Celebration had a foamy, free flowing flavor that was not aggressive at all. In a way, the flavoring left a lot to the imagination...in that I was waiting for more creativity to kick in. As it was on cask, naturally it had no carbonation, which in hindsight may have actually aided to the sharpness I have come to expect from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,gdrydenc,4.04,"Appearance - Gorgeous amber-orange color. I tend to pour aggressively, so I got a good amount of head on this bad boy, which slowly went away, leaving a thin rim of white-brown along the top.  Smell - Honestly, I can't smell a lot out of this. Even when I let the head die down, the only thing I can smell is a hint of piny hops.  Taste - Bitter, hoppy, pine-y. I like the bitterness, it tastes very fresh (2010 release).  Mouthfeel - Fantastic mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation, not overwhelming. I know immediately that the flavor is there and it lasts until the end... and then some. The flavor persists on my tongue for a while after.  Drinkabilty - Great drinkability. At only 6.8%, I can easily finish the bomber and desire more.  Overall, an excellent seasonal offering from SN, especially for the price.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The aroma is very hop forward, with a malt profile underneath.  Tasty beer. Hops play the lead role here. I really prefer this beer fresh, with the hop character at its boldest.  The feel is thick and coats the palate with bitter hops. The aftertaste has considerable staying power.  I look forward to the release of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale every year. Recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,feelmefoam,4.23,"SN Celebration pours a beautiful caramel-cider color that's semi-transparent with a decent amount of carb running up into 2 fingers of off-white head that has a really nice retention time and leaves some thick, foamy lacing around the glass. Really good-looking beer.  I don't always pour this beer, which is a sin, I know, but I just don't always have the opportunity to. But man does it smell good when you let it breathe in a glass. Sappy floral and piney hops jump out of the head and into your nose, and the only downside is that the beer isn't quite as fragrant as I'd like. I want it to jump out of the glass into my nose without having to go in after it. Awesome aroma, but just make it a bit stronger. I'm a stickler. Sometimes I hate myself.  The taste is tasty dude. Lots of piney, sprucey, delicious Christmas tree hops (holidays holla!!) jump right outta the glass and flood your tongue. Only after this does the malt backbone come limping in, weak and unappreciated. No sympathy here either, move along.  The mouthfeel is pretty good. Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation and a slightly dry finish (in combo with the hops). Pretty smooth drinker.  I really like the way this wintry beer breaks up the Big Stout and Spicy Warmer theme of the season. Don't get me wrong, those are all well and good and I love many of them, but a spruced up hop-bomb in the middle of winter just oozes holiday cheer. Now if the holidays would just get here. Cheers!!!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jonB,4.17,"Despite the deceiving winter landscape on the bottle, this is no winter warmer. It does have a a good presence of piney hops, that mostly cover up the alcohol on the finish.

140,1904,paulozanello,4.08,"I write this review 30 years to the day that Ken Grossman brewed his first batch of Sierra Pale Ale that went on to change the industry forever. Couldn't think of a better beer to ""celebrate"" this huge landmark. Here is a toast to Ken a Sierra Nevada! Cheers!  Celebration 2010 pours a translucid, almost transparent, orange-copper color. It forms a huge white head that persists forever with copious amounts of lacing throughout the glass. This is a perfect score in my book.  Aroma starts with floral and citrus hops, mainly pineapple, strawberries and tangerine. There are also several piney and spicy notes from the hops. Roasted and caramel malts are also detectable.  Taste starts citric but it soon shifts to an earthy/spicy hop character with a lot of bitterness. Malt backbone shines through for good balance. This has a dry and resinous finish with a huge bitter aftertaste that lingers forever in your tongue.  Body is medium to heavy and carbonation is perfect. Very good mouthfeel (sticky and resinous) but the drinkability gets hurt by the overly bitter and spicy finish/aftertaste.

140,1904,salvo,3.88,"Bottle of the 2010 poured crystal clear orange-red with two inches of khaki head that slowly dissipated and left lacing. Aroma much more towards the herbal and astringent, English side of IPA, than the orange-pine promised. Earthy, straw, dry corn husks.  Taste is bitter and astringent towards tea, with tannins in the background. Bitter on the front and middle of the tongue, but the bitterness doesn't creep around to the back of the throat.  This is a fabulous, sessionable, approachable AIPA: highly drinkable with good crossover flavor character, and a bargain (absolute bargain) at the going 12-pack price.

140,1904,hawks10,3.78,"12oz bottle - 2010 Vintage - Poured into a pint glass...  Pours a glowing dark orange with red highlights, very clear. A huge cap of fluffy, meringue-like tan head forms and slowly recedes, leaving lots of lacing behind...  Beautiful citrus hop aroma assaults the nostrils. Very tropical, sweet, pineapple and grapefruit. The hops start to turn piny with a bit of spice, while the malts come forward as well, adding a bit of sweet, caramel malts, balancing the beer and giving it a bit more depth...  Earthy, bitter piny hops dominate the flavor on this one. Bitterness is drying and lingers long into the aftertaste. All that juicy tropical flavor I detected in the nose seems to have vanished. For maybe the first second this beer hits my tongue I can detect some sweet tropical hop flavors, but that is quickly washed away by a one sided, overly bitter and dry, earthy hop flavor. Malts are there but don't do much to cut into the hop bitterness (for some reason, the bitterness in this beer just isn't working for me like it does in other IPAs...) Spicing starts to show up after a few sips and kind of just blend in with the piny hops...Not bad, but a bit one-sided and slightly boring...  Light to medium bodied, thinner than expected. Carbonation seems a bit low giving the beer a slick, creamy feel. Dry and bitter feelings linger...  Not bad, but not as good as I was expecting.

I'm not the biggest fan of the darker color IPAs-- and the micro sediments I see floating around aren't something I like either... However, the overall appearance is still better than average due to the retention, head, and lace.  Sweet caramel and bready malts... Piney and citrus hops are nice, but the spicy hop note is a bit too much. Without the spicy notes, this would score higher.  Taste follows same rules and notes asthe nose. A big dry spicy hop note is present in the finish-- with lots of lingering bitterness and a resiny pine. The balance is very nice, and without the spicy hop notes, this would score higher in my book. The body is very respectable-- solid carbonation works well with a medium-full body and a nice oily presence is perfect to compliment the resiny piney hop notes.  Overall, this is a solid beer. I won't be picking up a case and drinking 3 per night or anything... But if I run into this one, I'll gladly drink it again.

Aroma- Pleasing aroma of pine and some citrus. A hint of sweet malts makes it through also.  Taste- The first sip reveals those nutty malts paired with some smooth caramel flavor. The hop bitterness comes later identifying this brew as an IPA (though I think less bitter than last year). Well-balanced and inviting.  Mouthfeel- A bit creamy which I think has to do with the tiny size of the bubbles.  Drinkability- While the bitterness is very pronounced in the aftertaste, the warm smooth feel of a pull of this beer keeps you begging for another sip.

Pours a beautiful glowing amber orange with a solid 3 fingers of head. Pour slowly. Lacing is fantastic, following you the whole way down the glass.  Floral hops attack the nose with a very nice citrus profile. Grainy malts can be found underneath, providing some balance.  Hops in the forefront, citrus to start, though as it receeds you get a mild sweetness from the malts. Malt base is quite balanced, something hard to do with the fresh hop addition, making this one a very complex, though enjoyable, beer.  Slightly oily mouthfeel with a moderate carbonation.  Take it slow with this one, which may be hard with how dang good it is.  I've heard of the controversy as to enjoy this one fresh or cellar and honestly, it is up to your personal preference. When fresh, you best enjoy the fresh hop addition, but cellaring better brings out the complex underlying malt profile.

Balance of pine, citrus, and woody hop flavor up front, fading to a long, dry, bitter finish that builds and builds and stays long after the beer is swallowed. There is some toasty, bready, lightly sweet malt to balance, if you look hard for it. As the hops fade, a light alcohol flavor remains.

Otherwise, a proper ale temperature is in order, where the rich smoothness of this time honored recipe comes to the forefront. The American fresh hops remind me once again that it was Sierra Nevada who ran first with the notion that an India Pale Ale style could be used as a holiday beer, and I for one, am overjoyed that they did so. This 2010 version is the best I have ever tasted in the many years I have enjoyed Celebration. Not only is it celebratory in hops, but also malts, with plenty of strength (6.8%), putting aside its incredibly drinkable nature.

A great IPA that's great to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,apbarwood,4.45,"A warm, translucent copper color with a thin sheet of lace. A lively carbonation feeds a two or three foamy islands on the surface of the beer. Definitive pine notes on the nose with a bright, juicy grapefruit aroma all backed by a firm malt character. These aromas persists on the palate though the hops take a stronger lead. The citrus is a bit more bitter than the aroma led me to believe but it's a pleasant surprise. It starts with a nice semi-sweet orange flavor leading to grapefruit and a dry, bitter pine needle finish. There's a certain earthy quality to it, like a pine forest after a rain shower, which I assume is due to the use of fresh hops. The bitterness is aggressive but not overwhelming and doesn't go any further than the malt will allow which is a definite plus. The strong malt backbone to this one helps provide a full, smooth mouthfeel that accentuates the flavors beautifully. I found this beer to be incredibly easy-drinking and it seemed to hit almost every note. If I had to pick something to improve I would say that the aroma could be amped up a little bit and maybe just a tiny bit more malt but that's my preference. As it is it's an outstanding IPA and a definite must try. I could see myself drinking a lot of these.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mjn5036,4.5,"2010 has arrived- it's a good night.  I love the bottle art on this one - not quite as much as the Tumbler bottle - but its close.  This one pours and amber and copper colors with a massive off-white head white, mostly due to my over zealous pour. The head slowly returns from whence it came leaving a ludicrous amount of sticky lacing clinging all over the glass. A generous amount of foam rests upon the meniscus long after the head has dissipated.  The nose is primarily of the generous amount of fresh hops added to this one - a lot of citrus, slight piney hop, faint spice and soft breadiness.  The hops hit the palate first - a rush of floral offerings and sweet citrus hops. Following the hops is a fantastic maltiness that balances out the flavor profile marvelously. It finishes with the Sierra hop bitterness I have grown to love.  This is a liberally drinkable beer with only a faint sense of alcohol presence. It is medium bodied and smooth on the palate. What we have here is a full-bodied IPA engineered perfectly to be drunk on a cold night whilst sitting before a fire. Not your typical winter warmer but a work of art in most ways - close to perfection in all facets.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,krausenman,4.3,"A-The beer pours into the glass the color of a copper penny. While it is clear that is a slight haze from the yeast. The head that caps the beer is an off white color and lasts for a considerable time while the beer is consumed.  S-Initially, there is a combination of aromas that I can smell. Citrus/Marmalade/Grapefruit, floral and herbal or pine-like aromas are prominent. The citrus aroma is dominant but there are also fruit-like aromas of ripe tropical style fruit mixed in also.  T-The first taste on the tounge is a sweet syrup/malt taste that is backed up by a solid bitter componenet. There are herbal and astringent flavors from the hops that seem balanced with the sweetness of the beer. The beer swallows with a refreshing cleansing taste of bitter hops.  M-Celebration Ale definitely has a fuller body than I would expect from an American IPA. I would characterize it as being somewhere in the ""medium"" range for mouthfeel. The carbonation is on the lighter side making the beer refreshing.  D-The beer is well balanced and dangerously drinkable while having a fuller mouthfeel. Overall it is packed with flavor and aroma and packs a bitter punch that makes for a great combo.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,djbreezy,4.03,"2010 bottle poured into belgian style stemmed glass.  appearance - enormous frothy head, brown amber, transparent, sticky lacing down the glass just from the head  smell - cannabis notes, floral mixed with sweet malt  taste - bold but seemingly balanced on first sip, malt body very prominent but hop bitters are there as well, taste alternates, sweet malts, resinous hops  mouthfeel - medium/high carbonation, frothy, medium bodied, dry finish  drinkability - a flavorful and robust brew, flavor is very strong for an ipa",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,infi,4.13,"2010 release, 12 oz. bottle.  Poured into a nonic pint.  A translucent, honey-hued brown color with a thick and frothy, white, two-fingered head with like a 5-minute retention. Lots of carbonated activity going on throughout the liquid, as well as amazing caked on retention- thorough stratification. On the nose is a true balance of malt and hop. The first half is a nice aromatic bouquet of the wet hops - grapefruit citrus - while the second half, however, lingers more on a delicate malt sweetness. As a whole, the synergism of the aromas work very well.  Taste is very smooth and balanced as well, with the earthiness from the hops being identified first then moving into the malt sweetness. Not as much of a hop presence in this beer, in terms of bitterness, which was surprising considering how vibrant the Pale Ale is. Regardless, not a big deal. Very subtle in all flavor components, but still mesh well overall. Also, I didn't get any ""spiced"" flavors as others have said before.  Mouthfeel is really medium-bodied for an IPA with a thin carbonated feel. Coats the mouth and tongue very well. Drinkability is very high on this. The 6.8% ABV hits you after one bottle though, especially if the pace you decide to drink it is only a few minutes. Definitely a holiday beer: Thanksgiving and Christmas-worthy. Considerably tasty.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,obrendano,4.58,"great find given it's from a local 7-11  A - awesome nutty autumn brown  S - misleading a bit, not as much hops aroma as taste, but lots of very nice caramely, toasty tones  T - just about perfect, a sharp bite of hops up front and soon after a rush of dark malty taste, smooth buiscuity finish  M - super smooth, just right  D - could drink this anytime, any day, would even choose over most other Sierra Nevadas in fact. superb",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DNICE555,4.53,"What a great beer. Got a 12 pack and had a bunch of times at Eli's fresh on tap. I think the tastiest one I had was the one I enjoyed when I was playing black ops. So smooth and drinkable. Hops are so refreshing. Very dangerous at 6.8 percent. I could drink a ton of these. Very crisp. Sierra Nevada is such a BA brewery.

140,1904,awalk1227,4.26,"Consumed 11/11/10, last bottle of the sixer. Time to review.  Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass  A: Pours an orange/amber brilliantly clear with two fingers of thick off-white head. Not much lacing, but pretty decent head retention.  S: Not as ridiculous as some of the fresh IPAs I've had. However, it's a pretty nice mix of malts, pine, and citrus. Overall, it's a slightly sweet malt competing with a tart citrus for strongest scent.  T: Pleasant mix of malt and bitter. The citrus/grapefruit in this one is small, perhaps slightly muted by the noticeable malt and bitterness on the finish. It's a good ride though, as any solid IPA should be. Creamy and malty in the beginning as it slides along the tongue, finishing with a citric bitter bite.  F: Pretty medium body, maybe even thicker than most under-7% ABV single IPAs. Even with no head, pretty creamy beginning mouthfeel (if you ready my other reviews, this is one of my favorite qualities in quaffable IPAs). Beneath the malt is enough carbonation and prickle from the hops to show up on the sides of my tongue.  D: My winter IPA of choice. Stays in my fridge, and I can drink anywhere from 1-4 in a night, maybe even the whole sixer if I'm with good company.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,busterthecat,4.12,"Poured in a chilled pint glass from a 24 oz bottle.  A- reddish amber color. Off white thick head that lingers for a minute.  S- Crisp pine and citrus with little malt present.  T- Very hop forward. Fresh pine needle, pineapple. Not too resiny. Some malt back bone.  M- Lingering bitterness. A full taste that covers palate.  D- A very good brew. Nothing outstanding or special. 2 pints was enough.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,NODAK,4.05,"Aroma is rather hoppy with pine resin bitterness...a bit of spiciness in the hops was perceptible at first.  Taste definitely shows those west coast hops at first, with a good punch of pine hops coming through to define the predominant taste of this beer. Not aggressively bitter at first, it just comes across as piney with a nice, biscuit and caramel malt undertone following. However, on the finish, the bitterness comes out more and has a decent cutting ending to it with a somewhat resinous aftertaste. Pretty awesome IPA. Quite bitter, more so than most, but not abrasively so.  Definitely a classic of the style and one I look forward to enjoying. It will fill the bill for anybody who wants a pretty bitter IPA without being over the top and unbalanced.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,whisperjet,4.15,"poured from a 12oz bottle to a pint glass  a: Pours a light but slightly hazy ruby. 3 fingers of frothy head, retains well. Very prominent, sticky lace left behind.  s: They call this a hop ale and it is; smells like your run-of-the-mill IPA . Citrusy with a nice floral hop presence. Oranges and grapefruit.  t: Hops are nice and well balanced. Very earthy which I like a lot and full with a nice dry bitterness on the finish. Warm and rich with nice undertones of citrus and malt.  m: Thin/medium bodied. Smooth and dry.  d: For me this is simply a better-than-average IPA. It tastes good, I love IPAs so I will definitely buy this again. This biggest grade raising factor in this one for me was the real earthiness in the taste. Not what I expected from the nose but it was welcomed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Tifore,4.72,"Poured from a bottle into my pint glass.  A - What a beautiful looking beer. Pours a deep red amber with slight orange hues. Lots and lots of head on this one. So fluffy and straight white looking which slowly fades and leaves little lacing bubbles all over my glass.  S - Smells of fresh citrus hops and like liquid pine tree. Very christmas-y smelling. I'm really digging it.  T - Tastes exactly like it smells. Strong hops, citrus and pine. Very floral almost. i love the flavor of this, its so smooth and the flavors just meld and flow.  M - The mouthfeel is silky perhaps even buttery. Really soft with a fair amount of carbonation.  D - I will be buying many many six packs of this brew over the winter.

Can detect a toasty malt flavor that gets stronger as the beer warms. But the hops rule this one.  Mouthfeel-Medium body, with a slight oily residue and a lingering bitterness.

Great head retention that pretty much stays to the finish and thick, sticky bands of lacing. Very appealing.  S: Sweet grapefruit and pine hops. A touch of carmel and bready malt to it as well.  T: Hop forward for sure, but there is some carmel malt to balance it out. Grapefruit, citrus and pine hops. For how much hops are on the front end, it really doesn't finish bitter at all, pretty smooth finish.  M: Medium to light body. Moderate carbonation. Some slickness and creaminess to it too.  D: Good drinkability. Easy to have a few in a night. If this had just a little bit more malt backbone to it, I would give it great marks in taste and drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

This is beer is much better than I remember, could be because Ive been focused on IRS' these days and straying from my norm of anything IPA. I like it quite a bit. Better than most SN that I have had, with exception of Bigfoot. Could use a bit more alchohol. Instant citrus and lingering grapefruit.

140,1904,misinformed,3.68,"12 oz. bottled 10/5/10, pint glass.  A- Poured with a 4"" eggshell colored head. Beer is clear, medium orange brown. Decent head retention. It settled down to a large dusting and left some thick lines of lacing.  S- Medium strength scentwise. Sweet grapefruit/citrus, but also bitter citrus. Pine. Just a touch of caramel. Sort of sharp floral hop notes as well.  T- Citrus hops when it was cold, but later the pine hop flavors took more of a center stage. A bit of caramel malt, but it is quickly overshadowed by the bitter hops. Long, but mild bitter finish. Flavor was sort of watery to be honest.  M- Lighter side of medium. Smooth, with a light oiliness, but not mouth coating. The citrus and bitterness lingers which is nice.  D- So so for me. Flavor is nice and it goes down smooth, but I don't really find myself wanting more than the two bottles I had. Strong, clean hop flavors that makes for a nice bitterness. There are other IPAs I like a lot more, but this is good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Full-bodied with moderate carbonation and a creamy, resinous mouthfeel. Malty biscuit and caramel up front with a spicy, piney hop kick that develops more tart grapefruit notes as it lingers.  Great balance and really easy-drinking (alcohol is completely masked).

140,1904,bobjonesSD,4.14,"2010 Celebration - I've been waiting for this one to come around again - always a favorite. The head on this beer from simply pouring it into a pint glass from the bottle is amazing. Beautiful tight lacing on a nice amber beer. The aroma could actually be a little stronger - maybe it needs to warm up some more to release that. Lots of piney hops - no citrus or skunk notes. Good malt backbone without being cloying.

A: Pours a light amber that's transparent and almost a caramel mahogany when held to the light. 2-finger foamy white head that dissipates fairly quickly to a think frothy top, good lacing.  S: Lots of pine and floral hops, a little citrus, grainy malt.  T: Pine hops take the spotlight. The initial bite is fairly intense with a heavy dose of pine/floral hops that is very bitter. Smooths out to a rich caramel malt body that is very grainy and earthy. There's a hint of pepper. Finish is grainy, dry, and bitter.  M: Medium carbonation and body. Very chewy with a lot of bitterness, finish is almost mouth puckering.  D: This isn't the easiest IPA to drink due to how grainy and bitter it is. The ABV isn't anything out of the ordinary but it can catch up a little quicker than expected.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Poured into a pint glass from a bottle.  A: Orange and gold with a reddish hue. Excellent head with an excellent retention. Lacing all down the glass.  S: Perfect balance of citrus, pine and floral hops compliented well by a nice malty note. Earthy honey and light corn come through as well, and they are welcomed, as is a very mild whiff of nutmeg hiding deep in there too.  T: Nice light piney hop blast at first but hardly any bitterness. Citrus zest in the middle; grapefruit. Slight hints of honey, red apples, black cherries and random dark fruit are in there. Lightly syrupy mouthfeel works well with the style.  D: Not as strong and overpowering as other IPA's; even my girlfriend can take down a couple of these. But that's not to say it's not complex. Buy yourself a couple sixers to get you through the holidays.  Value: At around 8-9 bucks per sixer, this one cannot be beaten for a beer of this quality. This beer is not a super hop bomb, so most IPA freaks will take some points away from the score here, but as an example of the style, you'd be hard pressed to find a better one. Two Hearted Ale comes to mind as a comparison beer.  Celebration Ale is definitely one more reason to look forward to the holidays.

Smell is of straight hops, with a bit of a floral undertone to it. Tastes like hops, hops, and more hops, with an almost earthy taste to it. The bitterness is just right, and also masks the alcohol in the beer. The medium body feels incredibly smooth washing around the mouth, and the carbonation is very pleasant on the tongue.

A little bitter, but not overly bitter and the bitterness doesn't stick around. There is a malt presence but not much. No alcohol is really notable.  M - Medium bodied and medium carbonation.

Lots of carbonation streams, slight haze. Very pretty.  S : Pine hope dominates, but floral and citrus qualities are present in light from. A biscuity backbone. Very much like the smell of crisp cold winter air in the country.  T : In step with the smell. A potent load of hops balanced with just enough malt. Quite bitter at first, but mellowing as it goes. Even a bit of woody, earthiness and spice on the end.  M : Medium bodied, and a good bit dry.  D : This ""Fresh Hop Ale"" is a yearly treat. And this years is as solid as ever.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,homebrew311,4.33,"Poured into NB Globe.  A: appearance is a deep reddish orange with good clarity, 2 finger foamy white head upon pour, dissipates to a cm of head with retention through out, nice lacing  S: big aromatic piney hops up front, hops also provide a nice spicy profile on the nose which are a nice introduction to the malt back bone which provides some aromas of toast  T: things start off with a touch of malt sweetness, but this is quickly subsided by a huge does of piney bitter hops, the hops go from bitter to fruity about mid palate and the finish is nice and balanced. This beer has a huge punch of hop flavor but does not leave residual bitterness on the palate. Quite nice.  MF: high carbonation, medium body  D: this is is perhaps the best winter seasonal around, this is partly due to it being the only IPA of the class so to speak. Either way, it is a well done IPA that features the more piney side of hops without being too bitter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,surlytheduff,4.13,"Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Beer was a rich copper color, with a bit over a finger of fluffy white head. The foam really clung to the glass tight as it receded. There was a solid stream of bubbles racing to the top of the glass.  Smelled strongly of fresh and resiney hops, with some citrus and sweet malt aroma. The hop flavor is the first thing that jumps out when you take a sip. Pine, orange, grapefruit, pleasantly bitter hops up front, then at the end I picked up a subdued malty flavor.  It was medium bodied, had a fair bit of carbonation, and a slightly dry finish. It's very drinkable - assuming the corner liquor store cooperates and stocks this, it'll probably be my path of least resistance go-to for the coming months.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,younger35,4.1,"Picked up a sixer of this because every dude on The Beer Spot drinks the shit out of it and I've never had a bottle. Pretty reasonably priced too, just like most Sierra Nevada brewski's. Drank from my Port Brewing pint glass.  Appearance- Pours a nice clear yellowish orange with a frothy one finger bright white head. A nice cap and collar is left along with loads of thick web like lacing. Smell- Nice light hoppiness that smells pretty fresh but isn't overly fruity or citrusy. It's sort of earthy and piney with a definite Noble Hop like profile (even though it says whole American Hops on the label). The lightest touch of sweetness from the malts mixes with the hops and gives an almost floral like scent. Taste- Starts with a light bitterness upfront that's fairly earthy and grassy with just a touch of citrus. Definite notes of grapefruit and light pineapple that really linger. A touch of toasted malt adds a super light bit of sweetness to counteract. A bit of grapefruit and a touch of pine on the finish. Mouthfeel- Pretty sharp carbonation and a surprisingly full bodied IPA. Drinkability- Very drinkable beer and I'm assuming that's why it's such a hit. Not my favorite IPA by any means but it's definitely tasty and goes down way too easy. Glad I tried; it definitely won't be my last sixer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,WestValleyIPA,4.28,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle of 2010 Celebration into my Ommegang goblet. Huge fluffy 3 fingers of off white head and a nice light brown/golden hue. Smells cascadian, a little citrusy, floral, pine. Light sweet malt. Like the pale on steroids. Dry, bitter goodness on the palate. Very piney. Fluffy, creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Could put away easily half of this 6er. Overall, really makes me think SNPA with a Barry Bonds complex.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DaveHS,3.9,"2010 release. First time I've seen it referred to as a ""fresh hop ale.""  A-Pours light amber with nearly an inch of off white head. Leaves moderate soapy lacing.  S-Citric and fruity. Mandarin orange and sweet malts.  T/M-A wonderful fresh mixture of grassy, citric, and piney hops, all very fresh, sticky, and resinous, supported by sweet, fruity malts. Pretty standard IPA, with a sweeter than average malt character.  D-Nice to have a few bottles every year when it comes out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,nhindian,4.4,"To celebrate an amazing Penn State comeback today and as a toast to Joe Paterno's 400th win, I crack my first Sierra Nevada Celebration to him in tribute.  12oz bottle poured into a large snifter.  A - Pours a deep bronze, relatively clear but has some floaties in it. The head grows and grows... finally settling in at around 2.5-fingers high and sticks around to chat before making a quick disappearance several minutes later. Judging by the few bubbles rising, it seems to have mild carbonation at best. As I drink, I see the excellent lacing left behind and am quite impressed.  S - Smells of intense, fresh grapefruit and lush pine forests. Incredibly crisp and almost clears out the sinuses by how rich the smell is. I can best describe this as a relatively normal smelling IPA, but just more oomph, going the extra mile to deliver a bouquet that surprises and excites the olfactory. Light, crisp, flowery, and bitter.  T - I've had my share of Sierra Nevada in my days, and came into this beer with no real expectations. I've read that it is certainly not a Winter Warmer and is lively and fresh, which I found a bit strange as it's a Winter beer, but I'm glad I came in with an open mind. The best I can describe this beer is Torpedo, but much more robust, smooth, and drinkable. I definitely get the recognizable Sierra Nevada hop profile, but it's much more balanced by the malts to not overwhelm the palate. It has the citrus dryness and bitterness, the pine aroma, the sweet, sticky malts. I'm honestly taken aback by this beer. Just fantastic.  M - Mouthfeel, contrary to what I imagined based on the carbonation seen in the glass, is medium with moderate carbonation. Really active in the mouth and flitters on the palate.  D - Drinkability is insanely high. Goes down so smoothly and easily. I finished mine a little more than halfway through this review and am surprised. There's almost no hint of the 6.8% ABV that this beer boasts and the complexity and balance this beer delivers is a recipe for easy-drinking. Combined with such a low price point, this may be a go-to for the next couple months. Here's to Winter!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,EgadBananas,4.12,"Nice light copper in color, with a light tan finger of head. Little bit of sticky lacing.  The aroma is very nice. Floral hops, slightly sweet malts and a hint of spice. It's a bit earthy, and woodsy.  Bitterness is kinda kickin' at the beginning, but it mellows out to a nice sweet, woody, spice finish.  Ample carbonation, upper light in body. Good feel.  Good solid drinkability.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,raverjames,4.25,"A: Light amber color, very clear, nice white head S: Floral hops, touch of grapefruit zest, some malt in the background. T: Spicy hop character that is less citrus and more floral. There is a nice caramel aftertaste that hints at the malt backbone. M: Bitter but not too dry. Carbonation is good. D: I love this beer and go through a couple cases every year. I would love more hop flavor, but it is still a wonderful beer for the price.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CHADMC3,4.23,"Pours a copper body with orange hues with a pillowy off white head that takes its time dissipating to leave a sticky white lacing behind.  Fresh hop aroma, floral and garden like, perhaps a touch of pine as well, and even some earthy or woodnotes.  Rich hop flavors including floral and earthy hops, again hints of pine and wood, but also including just a nice malty sweetness to support the generous hops.  Medium or greater in body with medium carbonation and quite a smooth, yet warming finish.  This is a great beer, plenty of character to take in, well balanced and all around a delight.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DarrellK,4.18,"I've been having Celebration for many years and the 2010 redition is continuing the slide downward over the last couple of years. The aroma is nil, the color is washed out and while the finish has some bitterness evrything else is a shadow of the time when Sierra Nevada brewed like a micro. I've always been a fan of SN but the trend is toward acting like AB and producing everybody beer, too bad. This brew is OK for those who want to encourage neophites to better beer but little else. SN go back to your roots!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mweso2000,4.27,Pours a cloudy amber orange color with an initial two finger head that dissipates into a thin lace that clings to the glass. Fresh hoppy smell with hints of pine and citrus. Nice sweet taste not too bitter but the hops come through. Really tastes fresh. Even a slight creaminess to it. The beer has a medium carbonation and goes down nice and smooth. Very drinkable. Great beer highly recommended.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Buebie,3.91,"Labled as a fresh hop this year, dont remember seeing that in years past. Had to grab a tap pour, never had it ontap. Head production is fluffy like clouds in the sky, dallops form and recede to leave a clumpy thick generous topping. Lace is thin yet clingy, leaving random patterns. Transparent amber color. Aroma is pungent hops, earthy tones and spicie hops with bitter pine and hemp. A touch of malt sweetness although mostly drowned out by hops. Flavors upfront are mildly sweet and cereal grain like, but then quickly pushed aside and hops now bite. Bitterness strength combined with pine, earthy tones and a little hop spice, as well as a leafy mild minty quality, as well as a small amount of aspirin. Finishing dry and leaving a very bitter taste. Mouthfeel is a touch slick and evenly carbonated.  Year after year this is a terrific ipa and I love it. No balance really, but a hop lovers dream, much on the bitter dry end.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JizackFH,4.14,"A - Pours a very nice translucent amber color with a nice 2-finger off white head that left good lacing as it fell. There were also quite a few carbonation bubbles visible.  S - Smells hoppy, but there is also a sweetness to it. I am also getting hints of caramel, cinnamon, and alcohol.  T - Taste is very hoppy. It tastes a little sweet at first, then the hops really come into play and they keep intensifying. The finish is bitter and slightly spiced. I also noticed some notes of grapefruit and cinnamon.  M - Medium body with good carbonation. It went down pretty smooth.  D - This is pretty drinkable. It goes down good, and I could put down a few of these quite easily. I'm not sure why this is a winter beer, but I think its a great regardless. I would drink it all year round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: There isn't too much to smell. Some notes of mild hoppiness, citrus, and a caramely mellowness show.  T: The taste is an insanely balanced intermingling of citrus, floral hoppiness, and a caramel malt backbone.  M: It has a medium body and a crisp and clean finish.  D: It's really tough to imagine a more drinkable IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,stonermouse,4.29,"From the bottle into a Sam Adams glass.  Poured nicely, looking pure golden with a solid, dense, bright white head. Quite impressively, the head replenishes itself with the agitation of each sip. Every time I put it down, a 1/4 inch head just bubbles up waiting for my next sip. Cool.  Aroma is mild. I get a faint, nondescript maltiness, and mild hops. Decent, but doesn't tell me much.  Crikey, this thing is good. This flavor is phenomenal. Nice, steady malt backbone. Not at all overpowering. There are so many subtle flavors here on top of the malt. The hops are present certainly, but there's a lot more going on that I can't quite identify. That's a good thing, really, because the ingredients meld into an excellent, fairly potent, warm, complex, sip-by-the-fire IPA. Just wow.  Mouthfeel is quite good as well. Flavor envelopes my entire palette, front to back. Has a nice, dense body that is just short of syrupy.  Drinkability is quite high. I could see drinking these in the dead of winter, but also in the spring, early summer, and perhaps even after mowing the lawn in mid-July. But best of all, I can't wait until the weather gets nasty cold, and I can sit inside with two or three of these. I'm heading back to the store right now to stock up...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Zundo,4.15,"Appearance: Pours a clear copper with a hint of red with a frothy 2-finger off-white head that laces well.  Smell: A sweet caramel malt, big hop presence citrusy with a bit of spice.  Taste: A tart IPA with some nutmeg and possibly cinnamon. Has a woody taste and some grapefruit presence. This beer is warmer than it is bright in flavor. It has some sharp pine notes to it though. Pretty interesting.  Mouthfeel: Pretty frothy/creamy, the carbonation is about right and it is pretty smooth. Definitely a oily resin left on the palate, but that fits well with the seasonal warmth feeling.  Drinkability: This beer has bite, but the back end is smooth. Over a nice bit of extremes that balance quite well. It is definitely drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Blanco,3.78,"Very nicely carbonated with a light amber/orange color and a nice sized head. Faint smell of piney hops. taste is similar. slight bitterness, dry finish. it's a good, decent IPA and one for the price that isn't bad. There isn't anything inherently ""winter"" about this beer.

Head recedes pretty quickly a leave a bit of lacing. As one would expect there's lots of hops to the nose. Taste is again very hop-centric. Lots of piney hops up front, the malts kicks in towards the end for some balance. Has a nice earthy finish. Mouthfeel is a bit stickier that I would have liked but otherwise pretty good.

140,1904,musicforairports,4.38,"Pours dark amber, with a fluffy head that lasts a bit. Very clear-looking, but darker than a lot of IPAs.  Smells like resiny pine hops with a hint of citrus.  Taste is very unique for an IPA, I think. There's a lot going on, and it takes a lot of sips to catch them all: a significant malt backbone of caramel; strong, fresh hop flavor; and a spicy, peppery character. Finishes bitter, for sure, in a way that's not like the usual hoppy beer. The hops are there for sure, but this doesn't taste like a citrus bomb at all.  A bit thick in mouthfeel, but without having that syrup-y character some IPAs have. Seems fine to me.  Insanely drinkable for its ABV, and, given its seasonal status, something I want to drink a lot of before its gone. Distinctive and great.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ktrillionaire,4.65,"I haven't even been digging IPAs of late, but this one is so good that it turned that around.  A - It pours an orange-gold, translucent, and with a big white head.  S - Big hop presence, resiny, evergreen and citric in aroma. The pale malt has a slightly toasty presence, though it could actually be the influence of some C-hops.  T - There is a big and vibrant hop flavor that is nearly world-class (and is truly astounding for a mass-produced brew such as this.) The malt is very crisp and a bit toasty, setting the table for a feast o' hop. Big evergreen and cypress woodiness, citrus pith and zest and coriander-celery-savory notes are some of the impressions I am getting from this delicate and complex brew. Sierra Nevada continues to astound me; they remain at the forefront of the hop-bomb/IPA game.  M - IPA. Quite good.  D - Few things are better than fresh Celebration. 2010's batch is particularly phenomenal, and it is definitely leagues ahead of 2010 SN Estate.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - a lot of fresh hops, some spice, maybe a touch of cinnamon, more hops.  T - just as the nose indicated, a lot of hops, some spice, a slight sweetness on the back.  M - great carbonation and hop amount that wakes my palate up!  D - a really nice brew for this time of year.

140,1904,wmtxbb,4.32,"Bottle poured into goblet  Appearance: Clear dark amber with head that dissipates into a light layer of lacing. Small amount of carbonation that finds its way to the top.  Smell: Sharp oak with a mixture of different hops. Very solid smell for an IPA.  Taste: Crisp hop and malt mixture. Citrus and pine flavors from the hops. Very spicy and fresh. Best american IPA I've had in a while. The variation of hops gives this beer a sort of dry aftertaste that layers your mouth with that hop zing that IPA's have. It has a very specific mixture of hops that don't leave my mouth with a real bitter aftertaste like some well hoped beers do. I can barely tell this IPA has an alcohol content this high. It's very well hidden.  Drinkability: Well above average drinkability, if you like IPA's. If you don't like well hoped beers, then this beer will most likely be a turnoff. The variation of hops, malts, and alcohol give this beer a type of harmony that really shouldn't be referred to as ""balance"". That's really what makes this beer awesome, it isn't really balanced but it works for this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,FosterJM,4.2,"35th review on BA draft to a pint from T.Phillips in Glendora  App- Amber colored with highlights of mahogany brown. Bartender did a standard 1 finger strong thick head, nice lacing as the drinking commences.  Smell- Hoppy pine with scents of some citrus. With all the smells in the bar it was hard to pick between orange and grapefruit.  Taste- It's got a hoppy piny taste with a slightly bitter finish to it. I pick up little malt notes on the back of the tongue.  Mouth-Nice balance of flavors. I remember having the 09 celebration but never reviewed it and being so new to beer didn't appreciate it as much. Nice to try it again.  Drink- Def. a nice sessionable beer at the bar.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,deleted_user_357747,3.24,"Beers pours a rather flat and pale brown amber color, a tad cloudy. Erupting foamy head swells to 2+ fingers and is plenty dense and long lasting. Sticky, resinous lacing already clinging to the side of the glass. After a big whiff, I come away with big-time piny hops with a noticeable sweet fruit finish, like sweet berries. Some bready malt background. Taste is seriously hoppy, starting sweet and piney, then quickly fading to an almost sour bitterness with a hint mild malt sweetness. Semi dry finish, light-medium body, substantial enough for the big character. A little sticky and a very bitter aftertaste. Loads of whole cone hops, powerfully hoppy.  It's simply too much for me, but I can see how hops heads will go for this. Lots of hop complexities. Drinkability suffers in my case, this is just overpoweringly hop forward.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,chrismg,4.28,Bought this from a local Whole Foods.  A - Copper color with an off white head.  S - Fresh hops up front. Not a very full or strong aroma.  T - It doesn't hit you over the head with hops but there is a presence there. Not too complex.  M - Medium carbonation with a slight thickness to the consistency.  D - I could definitely have a few more!  This is a very good brew. I'm not the biggest fan of IPA's but this one proved to be very well balanced and drinkable!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Foxtrot,4.33,"Picked up yet another case of 2010 Celebration. Having this a lot earlier than I had it last year. Hopefully the hop presence is impressive.  Pours from a 12oz. bottle into my Stone IRS snifter a beautiful copper orange hue with crystal clear clarity. I poured this beer 10 minutes ago, and still have a huge chunk of foam floating around with HUGE amounts of lacing. Lacing is rivaling Arrogant Bastard status, and that is not an easy feat.  Nose is prominent with strong whiffs of pine, ripe grapefruit, orange peel with just the slightest kiss of biscuit malt. Slightly bread like but just enough to let you know that ""hey, I'm here to!""  The flavor is a lot better than I remembered. The main attraction for this beer is definitely the hops. Bright notes of pine, citrus, and a hint of pineapple sting the palate accompanied with a nice sweet and spice malt backbone, bread like as predicted from the aroma. There is some lingering bitterness, but its pretty subtle and recedes fairly easy.  Mouthfeel is bordering on creamy. I usually don't like it in my IPA's but it works well here. Slightly dry, but easy drinking in the finish.  Drinkbability is another highlight worthy to mention. Great taste with incredible balance and mouthfeel makes this beer a cut above others. For an IPA, I could down these in a blink of an eye, and had to pace myself with my first beer to make this review. Scary!  PS. This is even better fresh than it was last year. Looks like I will get another case in the foreseeable future.  --- Reviewed on 11/17/2009  4.5/4/4.5/4/4  My very first Celebration Ale. Picked up a case to age.  Pour produces a unique amber with a off white 2 finger cap. I say ""unique"" because I've never seen an IPA this dark. Retention was superb, followed by lacing in ample supply.  Aroma was full of caramel malts, herbal hops, grapefruit, and a light touch of orange peel.  Flavors of cool zesty hops come forth with grapefruit and orange taking center stage giving pine a back seat to citrus. Hops fade and give way to a fantastic caramel malt that really thrust this beer above other west coast IPA's. I really enjoyed the strength of the malts and the crispness of the hops. I can see why this beer is called ""Celebration"" cause its damn tasty.  Mouthfeel is a medium with a nod towards creamy.  Drinkability is great. The alcohol is tucked away well, but its the aging aspect that makes this beer even better. I can't wait to try my first aged bottle of Celebration next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Kinsman,4.2,"Pours a golden orange body with a nice rocky slightly off-white head, about an inch thick to start. Left behind is a very wet but sticky looking lace.  Aroma is pungent with piney/herbal hop aromas and a bit of citrus thrown into the mix too. Little room is left for the malt to come through.  Hops, oh glorious hops. SN Celebration is one of those IPA's that takes super fresh hops and blends them perfectly into the beer with skill. A palatable bitterness with plenty of piney and citrusy hop flavors to go around. A slight hint of pale malt in the background comes through, but doesn't last for long.  Mouthfeel is not too heavy, but provides enough body to carry this much deliciousness. Overall, this is one of my favorite IPAs. It presents the perfect balance of a variety of hops and truly defines what it means to be an American IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Me, avoiding poorly brewed beer, from a hidden cafe, has won another victory against the evil Mass Market Beverage Empire.  During the battle, Rebel spies (me) managed to avoid purchasing the Empire's ultimate weapon, the ALUMINUM PINT, an armored twist off can with enough power to destroy entire tastebuds.  Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Majesticsock drank a wonderfly fresh hoppy mix (with a flowery aftertaste) aboard his pint glass.

Taste is bitter hops with a kiss of malt sweetness. I also find a nice creaminess to the mouthfeel. Gets better as it warms, don't drink this too cold. I stocked up with two cases that were about two weeks old. Look forward to this brew every year!!  EDIT: Had another bottle and all the above holds true---I did find that the brew has a touch of orange flavor---just a touch---that sits very nice in the mix. 50-55 deg is prob. an ideal temp for this beer---really shines as it warms a bit.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,OakedCanuck,3.8,"12oz bottle into shaker. From notes.  A great looking, clear amber brew with nice fluffy white head. Lacing was consistent and lasting. It smelled like a muted down IPA with a stronger malt presence and a bit of citrus and pepper. This beer is a great tasting IPA whose hops are distinct but not overwhelming. This allows the malt and some sugar sweetness to be profiled. Some orange and other citrus also comes through. The mouthfeel is medium and a bit sticky.

140,1904,PDXHops,4.33,"12 ounce bottle that's about a week old. Pours a nice bright amber with a thick cap of long-lasting foam and plentiful lacing, typical of the source.  Citrusy aromas courteously allow the caramel to say a few words, but there's no doubt where this beer is heading. It's certainly more malty than its siblings in the SN IPA family, but the malt lends more of a bready than a sweet backbone, plus a certain element of thickness to the feel. Just a notch shy of Bitter as Hell; let's call it Pretty Damned Bitter. Loads of citrus and leafy hop flavors up front, loads of prickly bitterness as the finish dries out.

But good regardless  T- super bitter, just the way I like it...and the bitterness doesn't linger too much, either.

When it put it to my nose i smell some kind of funkiness, a sour, grassy type of smell, and then the malt.  Very bitter, and quite spicy. Rather than citrus fruits or flowers, this IPA has a really spicy, herbal character, somewhat resinous. Very hop forward, i have a tough time picking out much malt.

The flavor is more of the same, with a lot of bitter orange and papaya and some pine. Medium bitterness. There is a bit of bready malt in the flavor to keep things a little bit balanced, but the beer is all about the hops. Very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Excellent.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,geryeb624,3.88,"12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A- Pours a fairly dark amber color with a ton of off-white head. Eventually settles down to about 2 fingers worth, leaving tons of lacing of the sides of the glass.  S- A fairly piney hop aroma, with some buttery malt in the background. Maybe some orange marmalade type aromas as well.  T- A bitter, almost spicy hoppiness dominates, with the pine notes showing up pretty well.  M/D- Nice mouthfeel, smooth and creamy. Could drink a few of these no problem.  A nice IPA, though not much to separate it from the pack IMO. A good beer just the same though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,thebrood1987,4.82,Smells of leafy green hops with some grapefruit and then the pine smell as it warms. You also get some sweetness from the malt in there as well. I like this IPA because you can tell they use top notch fresh California hops with some really nice roasted caramel almost cherry like malts. The mix of the two is what makes this beer one of the best IPA's out there. I kind of forget what this tasted like last year but I just remember it being really hoppy. It still has that but since I'm so used to trying IPA's now that I'm used to that sort of bitterness. To the average beer drinker this will come across as bitter. To people who always drink IPA's this will come off as bitter mixing in with that sweet flavor to create a balanced but still ending hoppy beer. It sort of reminds me of a HopDevil from Victory but I'm enjoying this one a bit more. This is definitely in my top 5 IPA's. This is my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,FreshHawk,4.03,"A - Clear, tawny orange color with a very large, fluffy, foamy, sticky, light yet full, white head. Very good retention with a nice lacing left.  S - Nice mix of hops and malt. Floral and slightly citrus hops along with a slight spicy hop, also some other spiciness along with citrus rind. Malt has a caramel and amber aroma, and some breadiness.  T - Just like the nose, a good balance of hops and malt. Fairly bitter taste. Floral and spicy hops with just a touch of citrus. Sweet caramel malt with an amber/red taste. Leafy bitterness on the finish as well as a touch of mineral. A touch of spiciness persist throughout.  M - Lighter side of medium body with slightly above average carbonation. Sticky with a definite drying finish.  D - Pretty drinkable beer. bitterness and dryness may end up being a bit much. Sweet and stickiness also hurts it a bit. That said, I had no problem finishing a bomber of it.  Notes: Typically I think of IPAs reminding me of summer/heat, but this did a great job as a winter ale. Sweet malt and bitter hops pretty well balanced, but bitterness outweighs the sweetness. Reminded me of a mix of an IPA and a Red/Amber Ale. Another nice, affordable option from Sierra Nevada. Pick one up for the winter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Frosty80,3.46,"Color: hazy caramel  Smell: some citrusy/grapefruit hops and a clean malt aroma. well balanced. so much so everything is pretty much canceled out.  Taste: again hops and malt are in harmony. nothing really stands out. if they were aiming for that ultimate balance in a brew, they came goddam close. slightly dry finish with a minor bitterness that doesnt stick around too long  Mouthfeel: moderate carbonation. light-med body  Notes: this is a perfectly balanced IPA. nice, easy aromatics and taste. well rounded. nothing dominates, but then again it loses some complexity.

140,1904,lovindahops,4.05,2010 Celebration. An iconic representation of craft beer  A- a clear reddish amber with a great head of foam that has fantastic lacing along the sides. The carbonation dances throughout the glass with the head of foam is completely rocky  S- the hops are no doubt the main feature of celebration. Pine and tropic themes at the same time. The malt is established with some caramel too. There is even an abundance of pineapple right at the end. Freshness is the key to this!  T- the same hops dominate the taste of the brew. Very bitter in the beginning and very bitter in the end. In between is some grapefruit and earthy elements to keep the bitterness in check. Some sweetness is involved as the malt component as well. The alcohol does happen to take a swing at you as well  M- very creamy and smooth. It's good  D- Celebration is smooth fresh drinakable stuff. The bitterness keeps it lively and not absolutely slam dunk drinkable. Still very good!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beercat11,3.53,Picked up a 12 pack of this years batch. I have enjoyed this beer for many years but I must say that last year and this years version are not up to par as in previous years. Not sure why but the flavors are off from what I remember. Its still good as most brews from SN but too close to some of their other offerings such as the Pale Ale and Torpedo. It just doesn't stand out like it used to. The hop bitterness is there but it seems as though they are using different flavoring hops then they used to. My friends have also noticed this. Maybe SN is getting too big and loosing touch with the importance of consistency.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,soze47,4.21,"Here is a 2010 Entry. I love this beer and think it is heavenly that is so available and so cheap during the holiday season.  Appearance: Golden orange in color. The body is very clear with a lot of carbonation bubbles. A big head on a somewhat subtle pour.  Aroma: Very balanced aroma. Earthiness hops and malt balance quite a bit. Not quite grassy or floral, this has a hop forward presence is nicely balanced by a rich malty smoothness.  Taste: Hop forward, but not aggressively bitter. Very herbal and spicy hops play well with a substantial malt back. Malt provides body and balance, but not sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and somewhat thick going in, but it definitely goes down as a light bodied offering.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable and pleasant. There is a substantial taste that is at once complex, but not demanding of your palette.  Overall: Very tasty and another success from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,nickhiller,3.91,"A: dark amber-ish brown, almost like a cherrywood color with a thick one finger head that settles to an eighth of an inch around the edges. Really good lacing.  S: a surprising amount of malt for a beer that is so hoppy, sweet even, a little vanilla, fruit.  T: fruity hops, some melon, sweet malt. Finish is pretty intensely bitter and warming, perfect for a cold winter night.  M: medium body, medium carbonation, with a very dry finish.  D: delicious. Really one of the best winter ales around, even if it's not technically a winter warmer. I'm interested by the contrast between the sweet fruity nose and the dry bitter taste. I can, and will, drink many more of these.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MbpBugeye,4.13,"Late night review, done on my phone under the cover of darkness and a Seinfeld dvd for the 100th time.  A- Quite a nice looking beer. Foam and lacing come in surplus, they are supported by an orange-copper colored ale. Its on the darker side of ipa.  S- So far I haven't been awfully impressed with fresh hop ales, but I think I can trust Sierra to show me the way. The malt base its noted with faint cracker dryness. The real star of the show is a citrusy hopping. The fresh hops lend a fleshy, lemony, leafy character.  T- Very citrusy, but not the exotic, sweetened citrus I prefer. Its more of a bitter, grapefruit and rind type of citrus. Fresh tangerine sweetens up the finish just before a lingering bitterness.  M- Highly carbonated but it mellows out quickly.  I hadve this before and I will be having it again. This us my recommended fresh hop ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Thorpe429,4.17,"Reviewed from notes, though I'm sure J have had this nearly 50 times.  Pours a brownish amber color with a nice white head and that sticky hop type of lacing. Nose brings a good dose of citrus and pine hops plus some caramel and sweet bread. Nice combination of hops and malt for the colder seasons. Drinks quite well and is a staple in our fridge every time it is available.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MLucky,4.12,"Ah,good ol' SN. Always a pleasure.  2010 Celebration ale, poured out of a bomber into a pint glass.  Dark amber color, very hazy, persistent tan foam.  Excellent smell. Very hoppy, almost DPA-like, but some malt scent in there, too.  Hops are very much at the forefront, flavor-wise, but malt still present. Strong grapefruit-like bitterness that gives way to the malt for just a moment before the hops snap back for the after taste. Just a wee bit of cinnamon-ish spice.  Another strong SN celebration. As usual I wind up wishing they'd make it year round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Hints of tropical fruits.  T: Milder than I expected given appearance and taste. However, nice bitterness moving through from mid palate to back palate.  M: Pleasant and well balanced, nice that it's not too overcarbonated.  Very good session beer, loved how it is so well balanced.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Slow, light bead in the body with very slight translucency. Damned nice beer.  Smell is fairly fruity, quite malty as well with lots of light caramel on that. Nice, tart pineapple note and lots of enjoyable citrus aroma. Slight dry grassy aroma as well, and a very mild medicinal phenol on there. Decent, but a bit of a mishmash.  Taste is quite malty and boozey. Lots of sweet toffee flavours with brown sugar, then gets early hop notes with a touch of grapefruit and some grassy flavours as well, light phenols with a slight aspirin note and a touch of apricot as well. Slight woodiness on the back complementing a slight brandy boozey warmth.  Quite thick texture with a slickness as it goes down. Slightly sticky in the mouth, but pleasant.

140,1904,regspeir,4,"Bottle - Poured a cloudy amber with a huge fluffy white head which lasted throughout. Lacing was intense and lasted as well. Nose was citrus, resinous and flowery with considerable sweetness apparent. Taste is citrus, some pine, spice and balanced nicely with some nuttiness and caramel malts. Medium bodied and good carbonation, a little sticky but with not much bitterness in the aftertaste. Instead, this IPA is on the sweet side but crisp, refreshing and sessionable for sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A: Pours a nice deep amber with a thick, pillowy head. Lacing abound.  S: Smells very sweet and malty; hops have dropped out completely. Dark fruit, a small hint of citrus and lemongrass.  T: Wow. It's amazing what 3 years can do to a beer. What was once rife with hops is now so malty that the flavors remind me of an aged J.W. Lee's harvest. Malt sweetness, a nice burn from the alcohol, honey, bread. Drastically different from a fresh bottle; hell, it tastes like a barleywine.  M: Coats the tongue and the rest of the mouth. Medium carbonation.  D: Fresh, I can easily go through three or four bottles of this. With three years on it, I honestly wouldn't want more than one. This has gotten extremely malty, which to some might be a blessing.  Great beer fresh, and quite good with age.

It showed retention the whole time I drained the pint glass and left some awesome lacing. The nice, sharp pine is what I first noticed in this nose. There was also some light citrus and maybe a few other hoppy notes. The healthy malt base gave this IPA a very good balance. The hop profile is very complex and reflects the scents found in the nose.

The nose comprises a nice level of citrus hops alongside a pleasant bit o' sweet caramel. The taste generally follows, but the hops, which add a bit o' pine to their repertoire here, seem to dominate the caramel, which is no longer as sweet as it once appeared.

Head sticks around for a while and leaves solid lacing.  The smell is fresh floral hops, grapefruit and spices mostly, fresh growth of spring flowers. Smells like a very well balanced ipa between the bitter and floral hopping as well as the sweet malt body with the other flavors.  The tasting is so mellow and gratifying, the malt making up this beers body and sweeter character mutes the flavors and lets them all intertwine with each other to make an overall taste that hints at many different things but does not overtly try to overwhelm you with any one characteristic. Some citrusy grapefruit hopping, holiday spices, bit of cloverblossom honey.  What amazes me is how full bodied this beer is without being too sweet, the malt masks some of the flavors from emphasis on any one of them while at the same time taking a backside role itself, something that I have never seen before in a brew with such a thick creamy delicious mouthfeel. Makes it drinkable as hell, super enjoyable and I pretty much want to such it down.

This beer is great, beautiful glowing amber color with significant, lasting head, stained glass window lacing, and plenty of little bubble friends to hang out with.  It smells sweet, slightly grapefruity and surprisingly malty. As one would suspect, the bouquet is much more significant when first poured.  The flavor of savory, almost toasted caramel hops come through- but the real star to me is the mesmerizing light burley pipe tobacco flavors that are found almost instantly yet linger on your tongue long after the sip is gone. Malty? Nope. Not really, just sort of smells that way... Very intriguing. Tangy grapefruit hoppy notes also linger, but not in an overpowering way at all... Simply put- bold and delicious  The mouthfeel is great, a bit tingly but sweet on the tongue. I'd love to have it on nitro...  Well, I can say it- I like, truly like a sierra nevada beer.

Head retention is phenomenal (I have a hard time getting more than half the bottle poured into my glass) and it leaves a generous veil of lacing. I gotta tell you, the head is a monster on this thing!  S - Citrus hops are certainly a big player in this production, along with some sweet malt aroma, just to balance things out.  T & M - There is a nice balance between hop and malt in the taste. The hops are more piney than they let on in the aroma...I was expecting a more citrusy hop. Medium bodied mouthfeel, creamy texture, and it finishes with a bit of a bitter hop aftertaste.  D - This is a very well constructed IPA, and I can see why it rates so well.

Similar citrussy hops to the nose. Some sweetness present but certainly a firm bitterness. I'd call this well balanced, but on the hop head side of things. Finishes with a grainy taste.

140,1904,NightINgale,4.11,"12oz bottle poured into my Sierra Nevada tumbler glass...  A - Cloudy deep amber body to it. Very nice frothy caramel head. I didn't get much lacing, but the head retention was well impressive.  S - Mostly citrus-like hops, with quite a bit of pine and some pronounced caramel notes. The smell is pretty strong, though not too original or unique.  T - At first I was getting loads of bitterness, with very little sweetness, a hint of caramel, and lots of citrus notes. The finish was full of lingering dry bitterness. It definitely opened up as it was warming up. The beer mellowed out, offering some extra sweetness that I didn't get at first. Some nice breadiness. Some pine notes. Even some hints of spices (maybe cinnamon).  M - Medium body to it, slightly chewy and definitely resiny. Some crisp carbonation which was so apparent at first quickly fades away. Some warming sensation from the alcohol  D - Quite good for a winter seasonal. Definitely a good beer to have on a cold winter evening, but this went down fine on the spring day I had it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,klikger,4.83,"A - Rich amber with some red in it. Heads up very nicely, and the lacing is extraordinary.  S - You know that feeling you had as a child before opening presents on Christmas morning? I reach that pinnacle of giddiness the first time every November that I let SN Celebration Ale's piny, spicy, hopped-up bouquet reach my nostrils.  T - Hops hit the back of my tongue almost instantly, but there's enough malt to almost balance them out, at least for a third of a second (and different years have produced slight differences in malt prevalence, in my opinion). Cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg beg to be noticed among the excesses of grapefruit and pine, but they're quickly shoved out of the picture. This is a hop bomb, yet it doesn't feel as one-dimensional as it may sound. Finishes with sugary, malty goodness combined with a stunningly lingering bitterness.  M - Excellent consistency with near perfect carbonation level for the style.  D - The intense bitterness and moderate alcohol level may turn off some from sessioning, but this is as good a candidate as any holiday beer. Despite the overwhelming hop presence, this beer is balanced just enough by the sweetness of the malts to make opening a second one a foregone conclusion.  This beer is absolutely outstanding and is something which I look forward to on an annual basis. Cracking open the first of the season subconsciously flips my mind into full-on holiday excitement mode, and the next 23 or so help me to maintain my sanity over the subsequent weeks. I've had so many great brews over the years (and in the past month, for that matter) that this may sound hyperbolic, but Celebration Ale may just be my desert island choice. Highly, fanatically recommended!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,levifunk,4,"klikger gave me a bottle of this.  a - reddish golden color. little head.  s - smell is hops, maybe a bit a cloves?  t - like the smell, i taste mostly hops, but not very bitter. very good.  m - good carbonation, fresh feeling.  d - overall very good. hoppy, but not overwhelming.

140,1904,Flashsp2,4.17,"Sierra Nevada Celebration 09 into medium chalice  A medium pour generates a big creamy beige head that leaves webs of lace and a clump of residual head on top. The body is orange with gold and red highlights.  The aroma is sticky and sweet, caramels, oranges, pine, and earthy/herbal hops. Smells very balanced and inviting.  The palette is not as balanced as the nose, which is fine, that's how I prefer my IPAs. Initially there is a soft caramel and bready sweetness, which is quickly run over by the PNW hops. Lots of citrus (primarily orange and tangerines), pine needles, rosemary, herbal, with a big bitter/salty and sticky hop finish that lingers for quite a while. The alcohol isn't present as a flavor component, but it gives a touch of warming. I love the fade from sweet to bitter.  Body is medium with a medium carbonation, and is a bit slick on the entry, and a softness in the middle.  Easy drinking, with a nice bitter finish that is crisp and invites further quaffing. Although SN beers all have a bit of similarity (most of them), they are all quite tasty. This takes a second only to their Torpedo in terms of their best IPAs, and this one is pretty close to that one. I prefer the Torpedo though, as it's a bit drier and less malt focused.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,mulder1010,4.5,"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip---thanks to Jbowers56 for the trade as this is not available in Sydney. Then again a whole lot is not available in Sydney.  A-- Poured a golden orange color, very hazy looking. Very large light brown head. Excellent head retention. A good 2 fingers of head for over a minute. Eventually leaving a good one finger head. Thick sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Think this made the trip from the USA to Australia quite well!  S-- When I opened the bottle I got a smell of the intense grapefruit smell. Has held up quite well. Thick grapefruit and lemon smell with a carmel kick. Has a sweet oat bread smell to it as well. Very winter like and inviting.  T-- Just as I remember it. Lots of grapefruit and lemon, great cascade hops. Flavor just jumps at you in this. A little touch of sweetness in this to boot and a bit of sweet oat bread taste.  M-- Creamy, yet hearty. well carbonated and in some ways simple yet complex. Get that sweet feeling in the end that has you wanting more and more.  D-- Never was my favorite winter seasonal but a person's palate can change. I still prefer Old Ales or Winter Warmers but this is excellent. Well hidden ABV and could drink 2-3 easily in a session. Already thinking where is my other one to drink after this. Bummer I only got one in trade. There are better IPA's out there but this is an iconic US beer. Reminds me of what I miss from home...Beer. Good beer and good seasonal's as well. Am impressed how well the beer has held up on a trip from the USA and just as good as I have had at an Old Chicago in Denver or Tucson or at home drinking one in December. Note: if in USA score would be lower but since in Australia and only one other beer here can compete with it (Murrays ICON) I am grading against that.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,scootny,4.38,"This is so close to ideal it's scary. Huge head with the retention of something from a dream. Scads of lace and a cloudiness that says hop oils and more. A big citrusey bouquet with a light sweet pine and caramel. A bit of bread and yeasty dough. Taste has a firm grapefruit hoppiness with a caramel malt center. A fresh whole grain loaf mixes with the malt backbone and opens a door for the sweetness to flow. It gives good balance and then the finish brings the hop parade again. A lingering grapefruit skin has a touch of quinine as well but in all the finish is clean and dry. A dark grained cracker like presence hints at graham but not quite. Feel is crisp and refreshing with an effervescence that brings a light creaminess if you let it hang out in your mouth. You can easily go through a couple of 24 oz bottles like the one I have before me. This stuff is deliciously hoppy, balanced and while a little strong not a ""Big Beer"" so you can enjoy it without too much concern. I have to remember this one from now on.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Nice dark amber color with wonderful lacing and long lasting head.  I found this to be very true to style, and will most likely be my go to beer for winter seasonals as long as its around.

140,1904,OttoBomb,4.33,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass (December 15, 2009). Serial number on the label says ""926511637"" so it's actually bottled 4:37pm PST, September 22th, 2009 on bottling line #1, (see here: http://www.sierranevada.com/images/BottleCode2009.pdf). This was part of a mixed six pack of Christmas seasonal brews picked up at Armanetti Wine Shoppe and Beverage Mart in Chicago.  As this is an IPA, I guess I should be opening this one sooner, but the seasonal aspect should allow for some age through the Christmas season. Hell, it's less than three months old, so it can't be that faded.  Eyes: Pours a darkish amber, with some haze. The mildly dirty white head fills the glass and shoots up above the rim, but not over. The thick craggy foam laces heavily.  Nose: A strong grapefruit profile here, which I really like. Some mild spices also, and malts.  Tongue: A good hop character here. I really like the fruity, citrus bitterness combined with the thickish malts and mild spices. Some lemon spice flavor and creamy malts balance the hops very well.  Mouth: A bit less crisp that some IPAs but a bit more smooth than most also. Good balance and medium body.  Libation: I don't have much to improve here. Tasty, mildly spicy and warming. This goes down easy and I can't identify a hint of the alcohol. I really like hoppy Christmas ales, and this one delivers.  As an IPA and it could be a lot more potent, but there are enough hops to satisfy ll but the most jaded hop-heads. As a Christmas seasonal brew is strikes the classic balance of mildly spicy warmer and hoppy flavor. I'll be picking these up each December for sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mwagner1018,4.32,"2009 Celebration Ale Served at cellar temp into a standard pint glass.  A- Pours a beautiful copper amber color, with a nice effervescent 2 fingers of light off white head. Settles down over about 10 minutes, to leave a good 1/2 of a finger cap on the beer. Really consistent layers of lacing down the glass.  S- Really nice floral west coast hop, grapefruit, fresh and fruity with a subtle pine aroma.  T- Clean, bold, nicely balanced with a medium/high bitterness that holds really well. Malt backbone pronounced enough to be there, with a nice caramel, vanilla taste, but balanced perfectly with a strong citrus, lemon pepper, buttery, creaminess that sets off the hops.  M- Bitter and chewy, nice bite to the tongue and back of throat. Sharp grassy quality that is nicely balanced. Medium to Medium High body, good malt thickness.  D- Very drinkable, hop forward but well balanced. A great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MrHassellYaHurd,4.13,"Pours into a pint glass a pretty copper with yellow highlights. A fluffy off-white head facilitates this brew's fantastic lacing.  Big sweet and citrusy hop profile, followed by a nice malt and caramel scents.  The taste reflects the nose, but with the slightly roasted characteristic. Assertive hop bitterness and taste pleasantly accentuated by the perfect level of carbonation. Medium-body, and very sweet. High drinkability.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,abrand,4.15,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. I have drank this brew many times but never completed a review of it. To me this beer is much better fresh than with a couple months under it.  The Celebration Ale pours an orange to amber color with a nice bubbly head atop that leaves some good lacing. Aromas are sweet with malts, toffee, and caremel. I am also picking up some meaty notes that I haven't sniffed before with this brew. Taste brings out some citrus notes and is very smooth. Not overpowering in any way. Also plenty of malts and pines. Not much hops for being an IPA. Mouthfeel is fairly thin and sort of watery. Drinkability is very high for this brew. Kind of a mixture of several different styles and with that it is truly unique. This is my session beer for the winter months.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,aaron12,3.91,"so, after trying this again, i like it way more. all i remember from the last batch i bought was grapefruit... this tastes much more balanced to me. very tasty... i remember liking the 2008 celebration ale a lot, and was surprised not liking 09's. i think i got a weird batch, or maybe my taste was off that day, who knows. this shit's good, so i revised it.  OLD REVIEW : A. light red/golden, white head.  S. to me, it smells exactly like grapefruit juice poured over hops. it'd be like pouring grapefruit juice into a glass that had a strong ipa in it before, but you didnt bother to wash it out.  T. GRAPEFRUIT... sour hops. ...grapefruit. alot of grapefruit.  M. I don't know, last year was the first time i had this beer, and i remember liking it more... i'm kinda bummed, i don't think i'm diggin' this that much.  D. There's alot of pine, sour citrus, and bitter hops goin on in this beer, it's not the easiest ale to put down the hatch... (not that it should be)  wow, i need to try a few more of these, (not all at once), but if i change my mind, i'll revise this. until then, sorry sierra nevada, but this one's low on my ranks for you.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,icetraxx,3.96,"A: Pours and orange-reed color with significant bottle conditioning-like haze. The creamy three-finger head has excellent retention and laces like crazy.  S: Resiny hops, that sort of remind of a Christmas tree, not too much else. Not as aromatic as other IPAs.  T: A strong kick of hops, hops, and more hops. A relatively strong bitterness gives way to a quick and rather clean finish with minimal lingering bitterness. A tiny amount of malt goes through due after the bitterness subsides. Hops are more on the pine side of things than the tropical fruit side.  M: Thick and creamy compared to similar IPAs.  D: Good, but doesn't have the super clean finish of other IPAs that immediately make me want to take another sip.  O: A solid IPA that is on the hearty side, rather than the refreshing side. Excellent for those cold winter months.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SickGnar,4.42,"A: Deep, coppery amber with a faint bit of haze. Big rocky head with great retention and spectacular, uber-nice lacing.  S: Sniff - not a gingerbread cookie beer! I think I know what SN's favorite ""spice"" is.... Grapefruit and other citrus notes, resin & pine, some herbal, a bit of floral, and even some spicey & peppery. There is a lot going on and it is quite aromatic. Caramel malt is there, but it is in the background.  T: Holy hopucopia! Like the nose but even more complex and intense. C-hops are certainly there, but so are others - a great hop profile with lots to tease out and savor. Not to say this is some hop monster - it is not. It has a good malt base that supports the hops without either balancing the alpha acids or remaining in the background. Malty sweet caramel, nutty, bready, toasty character forms the backbone with some more robustly roasted malt notes of toffee and even darker stuff. A touch grainy and faintly husky toward finish. Also a fruity note that seems to be yeast derived.  M: Slightly above medium body. Plenty of carbonation, but not fizzy - more like jubilantly effervescent. Almost sweet and sticky, but also spicy, crisp and drying in the finish.  D: Immensely drinkable, if a bit dangerous at 6.8 percent. Hops are prominent, but not in a way that overpowers other elements. Instead, the supporting parts of this brew serve to showcase the complexity, nuance, intensity, and (getting a bit hyperbolic) the glory that is Humulus Lupulus.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Evil_Pidde,4.18,"This beer comes in a short-necked brown 350 ml bottle. The red label got a picture of a cottage in a snowy landscape.  This is the 2009 edition.  A: It pours hazy amber with an enormous white sparkling head (almost like a head from a Tripel), the dissipation takes it's time before it leaves nice rich lacings.  S: Nice caramell malt together with nice american malt, not to rude. Very nice balanced. Floral and citric. Perhaps a bit piney.  T: Sweet caramell malt, with some faint buttery notes. The malt is almost only floral, and then very American, eventhough they're a bit held back - but there's everything you want in American floral hops; pines, citric notes and a flowery touch.  M: The aftertaste is long-lasting and both very sweet and still very dry/bitter. The body is smooth medium and the carbonation is strong with small smooth bubbles.  D: The thing with this beer; Everything ise in great balance. I really love the American hops, but if the balance with the malt isn't right the hops then can be bit rude. This great beer has a really well-balanced mix between hops and malt - the american hops really blooms! Greatness!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,zoso493,4.03,"Poured from a 12 oz. glass into a straight-sided pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a very hazy orange-amber color that's difficult to see through. It has a huge four-finger, billowy head that falls all over itself while leaving some thick portions of itself behind on the glass.  Smell: This has a nice aroma of fruity hops up front with a lot of spiciness to found all around. This is one of the spicier IPA's I've had and it seems like the yeast is even apparent in this one.  Taste: As in the smell, the fruity esters are probably the dominant taste in this one. After that, there is a big taste of spices and grains that seems a bit out of place in an IPA. It finishes with a good bittering burst of hops, but this is a pretty bitter beer all around because of the sharper spices.  Mouthfeel: A nice medium-bodied beer with an adequate amount of carbonation . The hops cloy at your palate just a touch.  Drinkability: This is a nice-drinking beer, but it's very bitter which impedes upon the drinkability, for me. I like my bitter beers and IPA's, but I probably wouldn't have more than two of these at a time.  Overall, Celebration Ale is an impressive beer from an always impressive brewery. It's a really nice IPA but the graininess for me is a bit strange for the style. I don't want to sound too harsh, though, as this is a good beer that is definitely deserving of being purchased in a six pack.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The slightest caramel/creamy complexion. A taste that lingered at the back of my throat for a while...  Mouthfeel: nothing overly exciting about it...a general feel of faint carbonation which finishes pretty quickly  Drinkability: drinkability is a bit above average. This beer seems like a heavy one so more than about 2 servings would be pushing it.  Thoughts: All around decent. Nothing jumps out at me for this one but nothing offends either. So far the least liked Sierra Nevada brew out of Big Foot, Wheat, and Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The hops are doing okay, but are slightly less impressive than earlier in the season.  T: Big hit of grapefruit, along with some pine over sweet bready and caramel malts. Fairly simple, but clean and well-done. Long dry finish leaves plenty of bitterness lingering.  M: Thick and creamy for the style. Plenty of fine carbonation.  For me, this has been one of those beers that you look forward to the release of each year. Just a great winter stand-bye.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,foxmul924,4.32,"Appearance: A cloudy golden-orange color, excellent head retention and lacing on glass.  Smell: Floral and Citrucy--a direct result of the Cascades, Centennials and Chinooks. A bit of a Bready/yeasty characteristic as well.  Taste: Bready/Yeasty with an underlying sweetness from carmel malts, which is quickly suppressed by a burst of flowers and citrus acidity as it flows over the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Full-Bodied. A bit of a yeasty slur which is soon followed by lingering citrus notes. Somewhat of a thick buildup of residue on tongue that entices the drinker to wash it down with another sip (a proverbial Catch-22, indeed!)  Drinkability: Delicious, to be sure--but I might only care for two at most at any given time.

Fresh piny grapefruit and citrus notes, with a noticeable malt backbone.  Taste follow suit with resiny, floral hops that are less heavy on the overal citrus, but more so on the grapfruit in particular. The hops are really well balanced with a maltyness that doesnt stick out, it leaves the scene to the hops, but it really provides a great background for the hops to excel in.

It left tremendously thick lacing on the sides of the glass. Otherwise, the Ale is a nice opaque reddish-amber color.  Aroma: Very interesting sharp minty and citric notes in the nose upfront, with some toasted grain lying further back.  Taste: Crisp, bitter and well carbonated. The hops pack a powerful punch, especially at the finish. Noticeable pine and grapefruit peel hop flavors dominate, while toffee is also quite noticeable. Finishes dry and with a mild warming from the alcohol.  Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Creamy but with zing. Really drinkable.  Notes: A fantastic winter seasonal.

140,1904,Pahn,4.02,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Moderately careful pour yields a 1/4 inch white head that dissipates immediately to a ring around the glass. Beer is opaque amber brown. Minimal spotty lacing.  Smell: Mild citrus and grassy hops, with some cake-like sweetness.  Taste: Sharp citrus hops (grapefruit, with some hints of orange and lemon), some sweetness, with a clean finish. Nice flavor; sharp, but not too bitter. As the beer warms, a vague maltiness appears in the background, ultimately becoming a strong, tingly, bready finish. The hops stay strong, but the citrus notes sort of blend together and become a balanced, sweet and fruity flavor. Hop / malt balance is very good.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, juicy but never watery, with lively carbonation. Good vessel for the bright, hoppy flavor. As the beer warms and the maltiness comes out, feel gets a bit creamy.  Drinkability: I can see why this beer is a standby for a lot of people on BA. Alcohol isn't very present, and the flavor is solid and pleasant.  Celebration Ale is a solid, well-balanced IPA (a little on the sweet side, but not cloying).

140,1904,IAmNinjor,4.47,"Nice deep amber color. Pretty good head size and retention.  Very strong citrus/hop aroma. A little bit like poinsettias, which might put you off, but I liked it.  Really solid IPA flavor, but with a smooth rich malty undercurrent. The taste is built on two levels: the IPA on top, and a smooth, malty ale on the bottom. The spiciness of the hops complements the ale taste, and the malt balances the bitterness very nicely.  Solid taste on every level, with the sort of lingering hop flavors you should expect from an IPA.  I'm a big fan of this one. It somehow operates as a holiday ale and an IPA at the same time. It drinks well and is very satisfying. Unless you hate poinsettias...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Hoagie1973,3.78,"Big buttery colored head after a moderate pour. Head retains excellent and leaves thick sticky lacing (standards for SN beers). Slightly cloudy amber color.  Strong piney/woodsy hop bouquet.  Intense citric hop flavor with a nice malt backbone. Bitterness lingers long into the finish.  Medium bodied with strong carbonation even after a stiff pour.  Drinkable and enjoyable. Unbalanced as hell, but tasty if hops are what you're looking for.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Ryan011235,4,"Poured into a snifter on 12/2/09  A - Deep amber/copper color; slightly hazy. Pours a one finger head of off-white foam; thins over time but maintains decent retention. Lacing is spotty toward the top of the glass but forms decent rings by the end.  S - Sharp pine & citrus hop aroma. Grapefruit & hints of spice. Balanced by a malty blend of caramel & biscuit.  T - Bitter pine upfront with citrus worked in as well, though to a lesser degree. Spicy hop bite. Malts play an integral part without detracting from the hoppiness; as with the nose, a blend of caramel & biscuit.  M - Medium body with ample carbonation that brings the bitter & spicy characteristics to the foreground. Some resiny grit & bitterness lingering on the finish.  D - Quite good. It was nice to have a different ""go-to"" beer, albeit for a relatively short amount of time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Very little aroma.  T- Bitter notes up front with a biscuit middle. Bitterness returns for the finish which is dry and crisp.  M- Medium in body and with crisp carbonation. Slight bit of oily resin at the finish.  D- Easy drinker and the 6.8% ABV is well hidden.  Solid effort, and well priced, nothing to go crazy over though.  Notes: 2009 vintage.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Crazy4LegMoose,3.89,A: Hazy copper hue with 2 fingers of light golden brown creamy head. Good amount of lacing as well.  S: Clean pine hop aroma with the sweet smell of their signature pale ale malty goodness  T: Bread like and nutty flavors that blends with a good amount of citrus to finish with a slightly sweet and a little tangy finish. very good.  M: Medium bodied creamy ale.  D: Good drink ability for a full flavored ale. Not to heavy on the palate.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,qdeguchy,4.82,"Poured a 12oz bottle into a standard pint glass  A. A true caramel color with hints of orange tinge. Left a two finger creamy head with orange hop oils layered on top of the off-white head. Beautiful, sticky lacing left after each drink. This is a gorgeus looking beer to say the least.  S. Piney, grapefruit citrus with hints of orange zest. There is also a mild caramel sweetness that is quite subtle.  T. Initially very bitter with a punch of tartness form the citrus hops that is sustained throughout the drink. This is followed by a sweet undertone which holds the hop bitterness together.  M. A medium bodied beer with nice texture that can be attributed to the fact that it is bottle conditioned. Carbonation is nice and the finish is dry.  D. This is a highly drinkable beer for the well evolved palate, particulary if you are an ipa enthusiast. I can easily consume a sixer without hesitation or effort.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BearsOnAcid,3.67,"I poured a 2009 Celebration Ale from Sierra Nevada's signature 24oz bottles. The color was a hazy maply syrup with a big and dense foamy head.  The smell is pleasing. Some piney hops with a rich caramel and molasses malt. It smells warm and cozy.  The taste is pretty good. The flavor of the malt is key to this beer. I feel the hops are second since (1) they aren't really as pronounced as much as I'd like it and (2) the warm caramel, vanilla, gingerbread and molasses flavor coming from the malt is delicious. It doesn't seem as hoppy as people say it is. This is my 3rd year having it and either the average amount of hops isn't doing it for me anymore or it tasted hoppier in previous years.  The mouthfeel is a little creamy but then goes down watery. This is a nice brew to drink a lot of. The price you can't beat for the quality. I feel that this is a cross between an IPA and a Winter Warmer. I just wish it were a little hoppier.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GitcheGumee,4.28,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. 2009 release.  Appearance: Has a rich amber color. Produced a thick, fluffy head that stayed for a long time. Looks like the beer has a good amount of carbonation.  Smell: One whiff of this lets you know it was brewed by Sierra Nevada. Lots of Cascade hops and that signature yeast scent, all of which I like.  Taste: The hops are very prominent. A good amount of bitterness is present throughout a sip, with an resiny finish. It has a nice malt profile, but the hops are the main focus. Nice!  Mouthfeel: Overall...pretty good. This beer feels pretty thick, but there's nothing wrong with that. That carbonation is just about perfect for this style.  Drinkability: I could easily put a few of these away on one session, but I don't plan on it. The thickness of this beer would start to be noticed after a couple. I could see the 6.8 ABV creeping up on me as well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BuckyFresh,4.31,"Appearance: Poured from a bottle into a large wine glass. Beautiful golden/copper color and slightly hazy. Large, frothy off-white head about two fingers thick that lasts quite awhile. Nice even collar of lacing on the glass as well.  Smell: Bright hoppy aroma here with some citrus notes and and underlying malty sweetness. Maybe a tiny bit of yeast and spice in the nose as well.  Taste: I was pleasantly surprised at first with how creamy the taste was with this one. There is significant hop bitterness, but the beer finishes smooth and is quite a treat for the palate. Good malty character and an almost a bread-like back-end help balance out the citrus notes and bitterness of the hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full-bodied, with good carbonation and a very smooth finish. Right amount of bitterness and a warming quality make this one a pleasure to drink.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for an IPA and I'm sure I could knock back a couple of these. The ABV might sneak up on you though.  I really enjoyed this beer. The creamy flavor and bread-like quality were a pleasant surprise and not something you typically see with an ale of this variety. It was like an IPA wrapped in a comfy Christmas sweater, sitting by the fire.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Groenebeor,3.91,"A: Celebrate the bottle poured into the pint glass!  S: Smells like hops and cloves.  T: Tastes like Christmas! An IPA + cloves basically. Not too bitter but quite tangy.  M+D: Very drinkable, with a pleasant thing mouth feel. Not too thin. Not quite a session beer, but several of these could be enjoyed in one evening.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Telix,3.06,"Poured from the bottle into a Sam Adams Sensory glass. These are some sketchy notes because I simply didn't have much to say about the beer...:  A: Pours a nice deep copper, that's fairly clear, with a good head that slowly dissipates.  S: It's fairly mild with sweet malts and cat piss hops. I wish it were less bitter and had a greater amount of depth.  T: Some good malt sweetness, but a bit bitter and sharp. It's milder and a bit more piney than I'd like.  M: A bit thin, but more or less average for the style.  D: Eh, this was about as average an IPA as you can get, if you ask me. I wouldn't drink another one of these.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,stakem,4.3,"Pours a very clear light amber/orange color with more than a finger of slightly stained yellow head; pretty solid retension. Lacing is clinging all over the glassware. Aroma is a nice mix of citrus, floral, spice and well kinda mint-like hops with a little backing of malt. Bitter in both the front and the finish with lingering hop character. Thin feel with a moderate amount of carb. Overall a very enjoyable beer. Only thing I would discredit this beer for is the lack of malt in the taste.  Enjoying this with some blocks of aged sharp cheese, absolutely awesome.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dudemuskie,4.35,"Snagged a 6er of this fabulous brew (2009 vintage) before heading out to dinner at a killer Chicago BYOB BBQ place called Smoque. The beer and the BBQ are both highly recommended!  Appearance- Pours slightly hazy, intriguing orangeish/reddish/amber color with a big frothy light beige head that just doesnt want to go away...Loads of sheety lacing with each sip!  Aroma- Huge citrus hop nose with grapefruit, lemon zest, as well as spicy and piney hop notes. Some bready caramel notes and a hint of yeast (maybe from bottle conditioning) are well hidden but slightly noticeable. Slightly floral. Aromas make me wonder if the bite is as big as the bark...  Flavor- Yep. As always, Sierra Nevada makes another delicious brew just dripping with hop flavors! Starts with a spicy hop bitterness that lingers through the middle, finish, and well into the aftertaste. Middle shows some signs of citrusy hop flavor, a breath of alcohol, and piney, almost resinous hops. Some green/grassy/herbal notes appear in finish along with a nice supportive but subtle maltiness. A touch of caramel, but mostly bready malt flavors help to somewhat balance out the intense hoppiness of this beer.  Mouthfeel- Moderate to high CO2, medium-full bodied (though almost sessionable), low residual sugars, slightly pungent/drying finish from loads of hops. Lingering finish- burpin up hops 30 minutes after I finished the beer!  Overall- One heck of a beer and the piney/spicy notes really do help make this a delicious beer to enjoy during the winter season- though, I have to admit that I would probably love this any time of the year! Very tasty. Very Sierra Nevada!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BuckeyeOne,4.5,"Only during the winter does one beer push SNPA out of my fridge as my standard session beer and that is SN Celebration Ale.  As with every SN beer I've ever poured from a bottle, this IPA pours with a billowy head that lingers and leaves nice lacing down to the bottom of the glass. It's a coppery amber in color.  While this IPA has some malt backbone, it's a little hop bomb. It has the smell and taste of citrus and pine with just the right amount of bitterness.  It has just the right amount of carbonation to make this go down easily. Spent many a winter night watching TV and quaffing a number of these down. This is what I take when I go to winter holiday parties.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TexIndy,4.45,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottling date of 10/1/09. Was a hazy amber color with lots of yeast bit floaters. Slight carbonation. It had a large white head that settled into a foam cap and thick collar. Lots of sticky white lace.  The aroma is excellent. Plenty of c-hops, grapefruit, pine and toasted malts. Slight bitter hop aroma. The flavor is also excellent with good hop bite from the start to the slightly bitter finish. Some malt balance at the end to offset the bitter. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy but lacks a bit in carbonation. Not too bitter after-taste.  Overall, an excellent AIPA that I'm glad I finally tried. For some reason, I kept thinking this was a winter warmer which I generally try to avoid these days. Highly recommend. Rotation - winter seasonal avail here in TX. Couple 6 packs per season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Appearence - Pours a beautiful orage amber with yeast particles present makes for a cloudy wonderland. Nice hoppy head with amazing retention on the glass.  Smell - Celebration smells very toasy to me hops are apparent but not overwhelming.  Taste - An amazing IPA indeed gets better as it warms a little. Has citrus tones and a perfect hops combination for an amzing palate dance. Also not crazy crazy bitter like some IPA brews can be, amazing to pair with Thai food.  Mouthfeel - The bottle conditioning sierra nevada uses rocks makes for a perfect active carbonation that feels nice as well.  Drinkability - Wow easy to drink but sneaks up behind you and stabs you. just like their torpedo this IPA is absolutly nothing far from amazing to me.

140,1904,tegelaar,3.96,"12oz bottle I bought about 2 weeks ago.  Pours a little darker than most IPAs. Decent head and lots of lacing. Smell is a little weak as I don't notice a lot of hops in the nose. A more balanced smell. The taste is very bitter from the hops and I get a lemony goodness. Tastes really good! Light and refreshing but at the same time gives that malty, earthy backbone underneath it all. Mouthfeel has lots of carbonation and tickles the tongue. Drinkability is great due to the refreshing qualities of the beer.

140,1904,kbeals,3.94,"A- 12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass reveals a slightly hazy, deep copper colred brew. Two fingers of sticky, off-white, nearly tan, head float atop it. Very sticky head results in fantastic lacing and excellent head retention. This is what an IPA should look like.  S- A very one sided smell with a lot of earthy hops. Sort of reminds me of iced tea. A bit of a sweet, toffee-like backbone appears as the the beer warms up a bit along with maybe a hint of alcohol which was surprising.  T- Again, reminds me of iced tea, pretty earthy. A very bitter and dry finish. Some sweetness to it, but not much. The boozy smell doesn't show up in the taste.  M- A very crisp mouthfeel, light-medium body with plenty of carbonation.  D- Good, I guess. I easily drank the entire beer and could definitely drink another one. This is a very solid IPA and a good example of the style. The tea-like qualities were very pleasing and a change from the normal citrusy IPA's I've been having.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,albern,4,"This is a good IPA, but I don't see it as brilliant or worthy of the very high marks that others are giving it. It is a clear amber color with an okay off white head, thin retention, some lacing. The beer is moderately carbonated. The nose is leafy hop, some floral hop, some sweetish malts, but it isn't pungent or overly characterful. I disagree with the bros. on that one, the nose is good, but not exceptional. It is an AIPA for sure, but it doesn't stand out.  The taste is by the book. It has a nice balance between slight leafy bitterness, floral hop, some grapefruit acerbic citrus notes in the hop, and nice malty backbone, some drying hop elements, some nice graininess in there too. This is a very traditional interpretation of an AIPA, but it doesn't have the exceptional orangey hop burst, or the ripe oily and estery hop presence dripping from the vine, it doesn't make a grand statement. It is traditional, good, solid, but I wouldn't rate this as exceptional, just very good for the style. In some ways the beer is just too clean, too conformist, too by the book. It seems that other brewers of AIPA styles are a bit more inventive and more aggressive in their interpretation and have passed SN by somewhere along the line.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,boogyman,4.2,"A- Poured into my tulip glass a beautiful copper with a good 2 finger head that sticks around. Lacing is fairly sticky. Overall a good looking beer.  S- Starts off with plenty of citrus. Orange peel, grapefruit, lemon, the standard stuff for an IPA but none the less enjoyable. Definitely can smell the hops to come in this one.  T- Definitely bitter hops right off the bat and it is great. Got a lot of the nose and citric flavors. Also I can get some decent maltyness coming through which balances everything out nicely.  M- The hops leave a nice bite that lingers on the palate for a while until you refuel it with the next sip. I have had IPAs that went down a bit smoother but this one isn't bad it still goes down good but with just a little more carbonation and bite.  D- Definitely a beer I would have many of. Its a beer I wouldn't mind bringing to a party to share or to just have for myself. As a regular IPA goes, this is definitely a winner in my book.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kjyost,4.25,"2009 Edition. Poured into a beer mug, which left a ~1cm pillowy head on top of an amber-red beer. The head left substantial lacing through the session. Their was substantial hops of the nose with strong floral overtones, which disappeared as I drank the beer, which I account to my palate being overrun by the hops in the beer lowering my olfactory gland's ability to perceive the subtleties.  The beer comes across the palate with a well balanced amount of hops and malt with the bitterness crashing on the tongue as you swallow and lingering upon it... There were also notes of pine which I perceived further along into the drink. The beer was well carbonated and coated the mouth with its tasty goodness. I am saddened this was my only bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Squam256,4.16,"Poured from bottle into a stem-less wine glass.  Appearance: light copper-colored with thick head and lacing.  Smell: Malty, very light citrus  Taste: Much like the smell, I'm not detecting a strong hop presence although it is there. Malty/bready best describes this one.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, not much of an aftertaste  Drinkability: Much more drinkable than Tropedo as far as SN's IPA's go. A very sessionable beer in my opinion, I could drink a few of these without issue.  Overall: not as good as last year's Celebration, but always a nice, 'milder' alternative IPA, especially for people who aren't that big on hops (though I am)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,twaddlac,4.54,"A- Burnt orange, caramel color with light brown, yeasty head. Graded bubbles with many nucleation points. Sticky head that never gets too big but it doesn't disappear quickly.  S- Very hoppy, a pinch of citrus and undertones of toasted malts. Very smooth smelling, not very astringent.  T- Mild hops with a very nice malty taste, balanced very nicely. Toasted malts are very strong in the after taste, with a touch of caramel.  M- Sticky and a bit dry and mildly carbonated; the right combination to enrich the flavors of this beer.  D- This is one of those beers that everyone should try. I could quickly put away at least a 6 in one sitting because the taste is just that good!

140,1904,chickenflea,4.5,"So I like Sierra Nevada. A high quality brewery with a number of good offerings. But I always approach seasonals with a degree of skepticism. They tend to be seasonal because you wouldn't want to drink this beer all year round. Not with this tasty brew. Very aromatic with citrusy and some bread notes. Some maltiness comes through too. A very beautiful beer with a tremendous white head and medium amber color. Initially sweet but the hops kick in right away with a beautiful medium bitterness that lingers for a long time. Very smooth in your mouth. Creamy for an ale this hoppy. Very drinkable. After trying a bottle that my brother gave me, I bought a 12-pack. I look forward to one almost every day now.

S: The beer gave off a big malty, bready aroma with some hints of citrus and floral, possibly the hops trying to assert themselves, but being overpowered. Excellent aroma.  T: The taste of the beer is very good, rich, and complex, I would have thought that it would have been classified as a DIPA, but nonetheless, very full-flavored hop, with a nice malt backbone a nice bitter aftertaste.

D- Very drinkable, I never thought Id enjoy a beer this bitter but I cant stop drinking these. The bitterness is bold but somehow balanced out with a slight hint of malty sweetness.  I wish this one was available all year. This will be a gateway to more bitter beers for me.  2010:  The 2010 batch seems more earthy than last years batch...pine and citrus with grassy notes, something a bit metallic...still a great beer for the money, I will be consuming a lot of these over the next month or two!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Excellent flavor of resinous fresh hops, citrus, pine and grass, good caramel malt backbone in the middle with a moderate sweetness to offer balance to the good bitterness on the finish.

And I'm sooo glad I bought a whole 6 pack! Pours a nice slightly hazy amber from a 12oz bottle to a standard pint glass. Big foamy sticky head. Super clingy lacing going on here. Very pretty beer. Smells piney...very piney! But also sweet malt chilling in the background. Maybe detecting some alcohol fuming around in there too. Smells like a bad ass beer. Very big smelling beer going on here. It smells absolutely wonderful! Very complex. It's hard to pick up on everything that is going on here. But none the less, it smells amazing. Maybe some oak or something in there too. The taste is amazing! Beautifully hopped. A strong hop punch right off the bat...Yes it is really hoppy BUT, in no way over done. The hops just slam your tongue with wonderful punch. and at the end you get the sweetness of the malt followed buy more hop punch. It's really hard to explain everything that is going on in this beer but It's simply wonderful. Mouth feel is perfect for this beer. The hops balance out the sweetness perfectly. This is a big beer.

Taste is both hoppy and malty. it has some citrus and pine from the hops but also some bready and biscuit tones from the malt.

140,1904,CharlatanSin,4.36,"Picked up a bomber of this for a very cheap price.  This is one of the most beautiful beers I've seen. It pours a hazy golden amber with an absolutely ridiculous, giant, off-white shaving cream head. That head doesn't go anywhere while you're drinking it. It leaves probably the most lacing I've ever seen. Absolutely world class in terms of appearance.  The smell is all hops, a nice combination of pine and grapefruit. The taste is an unadulterated hop bomb. Pine dominates. It's like a Christmas tree turned into a beer. The bitterness lingers forever. There's a bit of a malt counterbalance, but you have to go fishing for it. I think I can taste a hint of cinnamon, but I might just be reaching for it because of the label.  The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, perhaps a little too much so for the style. It's super sticky, which is unsurprising if the lacing is anything to go on.  Overall, Sierra Nevada does it again. I often take them for granted, since they are so ubiquitous, but they truly are one of the best, most consistent breweries out there, especially for a hophead like me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,zimm421,4.11,"A - Pours a nice dark burnt orange to amber color, and is slightly cloudy. Has a nice thick, white, foamy head that leaves good lacing on the glass  S - Smell isn't overpowering, and there doesn't seem to be a lot going on, but there are hints of hops with a little bit of pine scent involved  T - A great tasting beer with hops dominating the flavor, just like the nose. Not very similar to the other holiday brews I had this season, but definitely a great one.  M - Full bodied and smooth, with a good amount of carbonation  D - Fairly easy to drink, but too many too fast will catch up to you and make it under appreciated.

140,1904,sicilian,2.98,"If you're a real Hop Head you will love this beer as it should be labeled as an Double IPA style. I really enjoy the regular SN Pale Ale and other PA's and even most IPA's are OK with me. I do enjoy the floral sharp hop flavors generally speaking.  This one has very strong flavors typical of a holiday brew, but they are totally overwhelmed by the bitter hop flavor and smell with little to no spice or malt flavors. This made it not so enjoyable to me as I wasn't expecting. About half way through my palate was numb enough to enjoy the remainder without wincing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Perhaps I love it so much that I never want to review it but rather just sit back and enjoy it. Either way, a nice afternoon with 30 degree weather and much of the nation gripped in bitter cold weather warrants it. A 12 oz bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada logotype pint glass... Appearance is a nice copper to amber body with a white head that sits well and sticks to the glass like a dusting of snow. The aroma is pungent grapefruit along with a caramel breadiness that pairs well with the bitterness of it. The flavor matches the aroma with a bitterness sticking to the tongue. With warmth, the bitterness subsides a bit as more residual sugars are allowed to display the caramel malt used in this brew. The mouthfeel is fuller without being heavy. For drinkability this one is no session IPA, but a sipper.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Marked 2009 vintage on the bottle  Pours a dark coppery orange with a huge head and leaves lacing all the way down the Pint Glass.  The Aroma is piney with grapefruit, alcohol and a caramelly sweetness.  The flavor is a bit deceptive, grapefruity and piney with a maltiness i wasn't expecting, you can also taste the alcohol the aftertaste is that of fresh whole flower hops like biting into a hop flower.  All in a a fully enjoyable experience.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Poured a nice brown/orange color, with a solid bright white head that was decently thick, left a good tracing on the glass.  Great smell. A nice blend of hops and malt really hit you. Also, you can notice a litte bit of the winter seasonal spices that are brewed in. Really, a pleasant smell.  Nice balanced taste and mouthfeel. Hops aren't overpowering, but you can definitely notice them.  Great drinkability. Tastes like a combination of an American IPA, and a winter warmer. Another great job by Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,humuluslupulus8,3.86,"A: The beer was a translucent dark orange color with an average amount of carbonation bubbles. The off-white head was thick and went away after a while, leaving a little bit of lacing.  S: I loved the smell of this beer! The main aromas were floral and piney hops. There wasn't much else to the smell, but I loved the amounts and types of hops used.  T: The beer tasted very similar to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale at first: a very good balance of malt and hops. However, this was quickly followed by a bitter aftertaste. The bitterness was strong enough to be noticed, but not so strong that it overpowered my palate.  M: The mouthfeel was a little thicker than expected, but it worked well for this beer. There was nothing notable about the carbonation.  D: Overall, this was a well crafted beer. The beer was easy to drink like Sierra Nevada's pale ale, but it had a little extra character because of the bitter aftertaste. Since the bitterness was not too strong, I think this would be a good beer for introducing someone to the aromas and flavors of hops in beer. Also, this beer would be good with or without food. I'm glad I bought a six-pack of Celebration Ale and not just a single. :)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

No visible carbonation. Decent lacing.  S - Strong hop aroma only hints at the taste.  T - Dominated by hops. Slight, sweet caramel malt flavor that is not at all balanced with lemony hops but just enough to make sure the bitter hops are still pleasant. Alcohol lends some warmth.  While this is a Celebration Ale, there are no winter spices to distinguish this ale from other Sierra Nevada beers.  M - Pleasant, medium body. Very fine carbonation provides body without being syrupy. Hops leave a buttery oiliness on the lips.

The beer pours a clear amber colored base, large white head, excellent retention and lacing on the glass. Smells of oak and hops with a touch of maple syrup.  Low Carbonation, full bodied, incredibly smooth and high quality ingredients... perfect hops in this one.

140,1904,mckeowbc,4.03,"A - Poured into a pint glass this beer forms a nice dense head that settles down to around a finger thick with a good amount of lacing. The color is a deep amber and is almost completely clear. S - As with most of Sierra Nevada's beers the smell is almost completely dominated by Cascade hops, not that this is a bad thing. The clean floral smell of Cascade is one of my favorite scents. T - The taste of hops hits you initially, it's strong but not as much as some of Sierra Nevada's other offerings. The hop bite is slightly muted by the higher malt content of the beer. After the hop taste subsides you are left with a slightly sour fruity finish reminicent of grapefruit. M - The high hop content and relatively high carbonation of this beer give it a bit of a rough mouthfeel. The beer is down your throat before the tingling on you tongue subsides. D - I find it very easy to finish a bottle of this beer but would question whether I'd have a second in one sitting. It's very enjoyable, but the sour taste wears on me a bit and leaves me wanting me to spread these out a bit over the Christmas season.

S: Nice piney hops mixed with hints of sweet citrus. Grapefruit and pineapples come to mind.  T: Subtle sweet citrus flavors up front give way to mildly bitter hops fairly quickly. This lacks the complexity of the more elite IPAs, but is still pretty good. Simple flavor with pretty good balance between the hops and sweeter flavors.  M: A lighter body leaning towards medium. Pretty smooth overall with not a whole lot of carbonation (but enough).  D: A sessionable IPA that is widely available. Not one of my favorites, but a solid offering from SN nonetheless.

140,1904,jeffthecheff,3.76,"Bottle code is 9286. This was bottled in mid September?  The pour is very foamy from the high carbonation. The head looks like a weizen. I was able to get the foam to rise 2 fingers high over the rim of the glass, and it took quite a while to settle down. The head is thick and hilly, and creates tons of lace all over the glass that you can't even see through. A lot of bubbles stream up the glass. There is a slight haze to the amber color.  The aroma has American hops with nothing getting in the way. It has a bright citrus hiding behind the pine and earthy, leafy character of the hops. The strength is good, and it's still fresh after 3+ months.  Carbonation is high, which is no surprise. The big, sweet body and creamy feel from the head contribute to accentuate the malt character, which has some nice, light sweetness to it. Maybe it's because of the interaction with the hops, but it has a red candy flavor to it. The hops taste dark and herbal and contribute a very strong, blunt, bitter finish that lingers. This is a nice big IPA. It's a good thing to have in the fridge for one or two pours, but I wouldn't make a session of this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Oh, guess I made that clear already.  T: EXTREMELY hoppy... again, there's citrus present as well, along with some malt, but the bitterness cuts through more than anything else. Long duration, of course.  M: Medium-bodied, creamy, with soft-to-average carbonation.  D: The high bitterness would prevent me from drinking this beer all night, but it's so hoppy and aromatic that I would WANT to drink more if I could.

140,1904,dsw4b,4.61,"This beer was an impulse buy prompted by a surprisingly low price. I took note of the brewery and little else. It should come as no surprise, then, that I expected a very malty beer with little hop presence and a very full body. It seems a large number of beers brewed for the holiday season fit into that mold. The initial aroma did little to convince me otherwise. My wife disagrees with the mild aroma assessment, so maybe I'm imagining that (or have a cold or something). Anyway...  Wow. Lurking beneath the mild aroma was a mouthful of hops. The body is medium-light and the head is soft and seems to last forever. But the hops... There is almost no balance contributed by the malts, and for me, that is a good thing. A little more in the area of aroma might be desired (if for no other reason but as a warning to unsuspecting drinkers), but overall, this could easily be my favorite beer for now.

S- Piney and herbal hops dominate the nose. Lesser pale malt aromas kick-around in the background. Simple, yet elegant.  T- Hops dominate the palate. Once in the mouth, the hops are reminiscent of grapefruit rind. The crackerlike malts are almost completely eclipsed by the hop dominance. The bitter grapefruit flavor lasts through the long/lingering finish. Very unbalanced, yet still quite tasty.  M- Thin to medium body... well-attenuated with some moderate carbonation.

Faint kiss of floral and citrus plus a hint towards a nice malt presence. Taste is a big punch of piney, earthy hops - very cologne like, which is a slight turn off - faint floral and citrusy hops noted right before a slight malty backbone presents itelf. Finishes very bitter and dry with a noticible aftertaste. Not in my wheelhouse as far as IPAs go, had higher hopes for this but the hop profile just turns me off from full enjoyment.

140,1904,bosox941827,5,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into an Imperial pint glass.  A: A soothing clear amber/orange color - you know you're going to have a good beer when you see this color. Pour it rough and you get a nice rocky head that will leave its ring with each sip... S: Right after the pour you get the hops...as the head dissipates a bit it becomes more balanced as you might expect. T: The essence of a hoppy beer. Hops on the front, malt in the middle as some leverage, resolving back into hops, which linger for quite a while. What does it for me with this beer is the bit of sweetness you get in the middle that gives it balance as it resolves into the finishing hops. If you began with the hops and went right to hops again to finish it off, you could, with justification, label this as unbalanced (with the accompanying mouth-fatigue), but that bit of sweetness in the middle is what makes this beer world-class (said the unconverted hop-head!). What also distinguishes this beer from other IPAs, is the LACK of toasted malts, which usually make themselves known at the front of the palate (see: Titan, Stone, etc., etc.). In fact, I had a Titan IPA just prior to this, and even though the IBU are identical, the hop-punch of the SN is leagues ahead of the Titan. This IPA puts the hops at the front and at the end, with the malt in the middle, the way an IPA should be, IMHO. M: Almost like a fine French Champagne, tiny bubbles that are almost not there. D: I could drink this beer all day, although I can see how a non-hophead may get mouth-fatigue. Also, the somewhat high ABV of 6.8% (though non-discernable on the palate) will sneak up on you before you know it.  I LOVE this beer - it is the standard against which other IPAs should be judged.

Herbs, citrics and little alcohol, but i get intense wood and nuts, that make the smell very complex (first time, almost dislikeded it).

Huge smell of spicy-hoppy grapefruit and pine and a little bit of something sweeter like cinnamon toast. The aroma is absolutely amazing.  Toasty malt and mild spice up front, followed quickly by pine and citrus huge hop bitterness with a very slight trace of malt. Long, fruity, bitter hop finish.  Light-Medium body and very smooth even with the moderate carbonation.  This beer is for the hop lover. There is more complexity in the hop characteristics and olfactory sense than in the malt profile, which results in a surprisingly light yet complex experience. I can't imagine aging it and letting go any of the fresh hop character.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,KTCamm,4.38,"Pourd from the 24 ounce seasonal bomber (or bomber+2) into a pint glass.  Pours light to medium amber with thick creamy white head of foam with a good retention. Patience is a virtue. Laces like crazy.  Smell is hoppy cinammon. There are notes of pine and grass that you'd expect from an SN brew, with the winter spice, smells strangely like Christmas.  The taste is wonderful - not being a huge hophead myself, I found there to be an underlying sweetness perfectly balanced with a hop finish. Peppery bite at the finish. Very pleasing aftertaste. Everything is working for me, and still 18 ounces to go.  Great carbonation and mouthfeel.  I can have trouble knocking back the big boy IPAs, but this one practically drank itself. Very drinkable.  Highly recommend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,parkeak0,4.23,"SNCA is a perennial favorite of mine. From December through March, it's definitely one of the beers I drink the most.  Pours a crystal clear amber color - very pretty. Nose is dominated by a wonderful hop bouquet - lots of pine, with plenty of citrus and some grass in the background. Pine prevails on the palate, but is well balanced by a nice malt backbone. This is a pretty dry and bitter IPA - which is exactly how I like them. The dryness and bitterness render this brew quite refreshing. If only I had the discipline to hold on to a few of these until the summer months....  Drinkability is high. I often enjoy more than one of these at a time... a great session brew.

140,1904,Drazzamatazz,4.28,"2009.  Bottle into SA Perfect Pint.  A: I wish all IPA's looked this good. Nice darker hue then your typical ale, with a thick floating head that just grabs onto your glass the whole way down. S: Nice bread dough notes that remind me this is more than just your typical IPA. There's also some semi-sweet pine pitch in there. T: Wow, I just drank christmas. Nice toasty malts up front followed by some typical season spices. That was dessert. Now we are sitting by the tree, and there's that hop punch. Sweet douglas-fir with a hint of grapefruit. For as hard as it comes it cleans the palate smoothly. M: Fairly light overall, would actually like a little more in this area. Maybe I'm just wanting a little more body from a winter brew. D: I was hoping to age a few of these after hearing good things about their transformation...but they seem to have all been emptied. I didn't think this is what a Christmas beer should taste like, but having had it I wouldn't want anything to change.  A quite good IPA, one of SNs best beers.

S: The hops give off a great floral and citrus aroma. There also a very pleasing pine tree smell, definitely apt for a Christmas beer.  T: Good bitterness from the hops; the pine tree carries over to the taste of the beer, and blends well with the lingering tastes of citrus. The finish is rather dry with nice bitterness. Barely a hint of alcohol.  F: The hops give a medium body, with good carbonation.  D: A very drinkable beer. The bitter hops blend pretty well with the pine and citrus notes, making for a great balanced beer. I wouldn't hesitate to drink a few more if it wasn't for work in the morning.

The sweet caramely malt comes through under the hops. Finishes fruity and lightly bitter. M: Nice carbonation. Goes down easy. Medium body, not oily.

140,1904,alleykatking,3.72,Poured from 12oz bottle. Review from notes.  A- Pours a semi-hazy amber copper color. Half finger off white head that dies down leaving wisps of foam on the top of the beer. Leaves soapy lacing that clings to the glass sides.  S- Sweet light malts is something that I pick up on at first. This is then over ran by lots of citrus and pine hops. Everything is blending in well. Pine hops come through first along with grapefruit notes behind that. There is a light biscuit malt present.  T- Bitter hops come through in full force with citrus notes at the front. Sweet biscuit malts come into play in the middle. Seems like there might be a light spice note in the middle as well before another light hop bite on the end of this.  M- Medium light mouthfeel. Carbonation like most Sierra Nevada beers is right on. Clean and crisp tasting in the mouth leaving bitter resiny hops on the palate. Piney aftertaste with this beer.  D- This is a very drinkable beer that I always wait around for. Nice IPA with a Sierra Nevada twist to it.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Genuine,4.35,"Poured from the bottle into a clean pint glass.  Poured dark amber in color ,with a slight off white head. Very thick head ,which came from a higher altitude pour. Leaves very nice lacing down the side of the glass.  S - I detect a good deal of pine and citrusy notes come across the nose. Maybe a dash of sweetness and holiday memories.  T - At first, the ones reminds me of their torpedo ale, maybe it's because of the citrus notes and cascade hops. This one does become more distinct though, when it warms up a bit. Perfect for the holidays. Just the right amount of hops to go with the malts. I think it's a great balance.  M - Medium body. Nothing too heavy but it's not light either. Prickly, if that is even a way to describe it.  D - I could definitely have a few of these. Awesome for the holidays. Pairs great with food.  ---  2010 Review  Pours a very nice and dark copper/amber, which is has a slight cream in color, head. Very nice lacing.  Smell - I think it smells just like last years, oh it brings back the memories. Hops come through, grapefruit, pine, citrus.  Taste - I will have to say that this one is just as good as last years, but it is balanced and quite delicious. I don't know what it is that they add to this one, but it's just different enough that it begins with the hop bitterness, then the malts come in to round things out, but not totally even...then the finish showcases a very slight sweetness.  Mouthfeel - Medium, awesome carbonation, perfect amount, nice and prickly.  Drinkability - No problem having a few of these, that's for sure. I believe my 12, 12 packs shows my love for Celebration. All around awesome American IPA, that I can't wait for it to show up next year. Definitely a beer that I look forward to every season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Chico1985,4.1,"12 oz. bottle.  Pours a hazy orange with some sediment floating around, kind of weird soapy head. All I can pick up for smells is a little hoppiness. Taste is great, very hoppy with tastes of grassy citrus, pine and a slightly bready aftertaste. Citrus definitely starts to show through more towards the end. A little bitter but not overly so. A little more carbonation than what I prefer. Drinkability is the highlight though, easy to drink and session, very good for the price, and tastes great. I will be buying this for hopefully many winters to come.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,everetends,4.13,"Picked this up at Smokin Joes outside J'ville, AL. I think I paid $9 for a sixer. This is the last bottle of the sixer because the other 5 were just so easily drinkable. Served up in my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass.  A: Off the pour, I am getting a light amber in color. Has a bit too much in the yellow and orange hues department to be amber I suppose. Held to the light it absolutely has a more orange appearance. Pretty clear body, maybe just a bit of haze, may be a stretch to call it haze. The pout got me about 3 fingers of white head, was a bit vigorous I suppose. The head creates a good amount of lace all over the glass, keeping a thick webbing all the way down. Nicely done for sure.  S: Forgive me, I have a bit of a sinus infection so my description the smell and taste may be a bit off. As far as the smell, I am getting a good amount of piney hop aroma. The resin is pretty potent. Behind that I am getting some grapefruit hints as well. Malts are light but present, biscuity. It is pretty fragant, and the aromas go very well together, meshing.  T: Yet again, we start off with the hops. A hearty helping of pine resin is pretty present. Dig it very much. Grapefruit is has a nice mix and balance to the hop profile. Malts mingle with these hops but I wouldn't say they balance, absolutely stays on the hoppy area. There is just enough of a Christmas baking spice presence to let me know its there, but its not enough to let me know what it is or overpower anything going on here. This is an IPA flavor with a touch of Christmas cheer.  M: Light side of medium in body. Carbonation isa touch high, maybe a bit too bubbly for my total liking but it doesn't kill the experience. Light alcohol heat on the throat. Resin does sit on the palate a bit. Aftertaste is pine and grapefruit.  D: I really enjoyed this beer. This is the first time I have had the chance to have it here in Alabama, and I am more than please. So easily drinkable. Not the most complex beer but the flavors are very well crafted in my opinion. I would be more than happy to see this beer as a year around because it is so easy drinking and pleasing. Dig on it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Copper in color with excellent head retention and lace.  Hop aromas. Various hop aromas. Hoppy, Period.  Taste as it smells, aggresivley bitter, surpassed my bitterness expectations. A whisper of a malt bill with medium caramel malts may exist, but little trace if any.  Mouthfeel is bitter dominance with medium body and carbonation, right on IMHO.  Drinkability is a high for an IPA. Bitter for sure, but not to heavy or high ABV for an IPA so it makes it addictively sessionable.

Very x'masy. Fairly sweet and malty on the front; astringent, grapefruity hops punch through the back. Tasty. This is a winter beer? Mmm. Good drinkability. Mouthfeel is refreshing and lively.

140,1904,Dijeriduster,3.73,"I've had this many times but first review. I prefer this on tap but its nice in the bottle as well - I hear it ages very well and have a few cellared....  A - Dark ambery tones with a slighty hazy look. Good almost reddish head that doesn't linger too long.  S - Rich amber notes with plenty of hops hidden in there. A hint of spice, but really its the hop nose that comes thru  T - Kinda rich like a IIPA with lots of hops coming thru. Starts off with the amber malt tones then quickly succumbs to the massive hop flavour.  M - Somewhat chewy and thick - this is a holiday beer after all. Carbonation is kinda high, but this is good as it holds up the hops a little more. Good swisher.  D - Pretty high. While its not the venerated SN Pale Ale this is a close second. A little less of a drinking beer due to the heavy malt and chewy mouthfeel but a great beer for the holidays and wonderful with meals.

140,1904,heliosphann,3.56,"12oz snubby poured in a pint glass.  A: Half a finger of light brown, soapy head. Fades moderately quickly and leaves a nice oil slick on top. Looks a crisp, crystal clear amber in the glass. Good visible carbonation and some decent lacing for an IPA.  S: Upfront are bright, resiny hops. Some biscuity malts in the mix add some sweetness. Not overly fragrant.  T: Pretty similar to how it smells, hops are there with plenty of pine and resin. Malts are there providing some balance, but fall short. Sweetness, followed by a very sharp bitterness on the finish.  M: Pretty typical of the style. I found it to be slightly over carbonated however.  D: Sessionable to a degree (for me it could be) with an under 7% ABV. The strong bitterness on finish though would wear your palate down quickly. After one 12oz serving, I'm already feeling it.  I'm somewhat disappointed with SN's Celebration Ale as I found it overall to be too unbalanced. I remember really enjoying it a few years ago. I think that bottle might have had a year of age on it, which could really cut down on the bitterness factor. I think I might pick another bottle up and see how it ages for myself.

A bit of Bread in the finish with a little bit more hop bitterness. Its all about the hops though..the alcohol is there for sure, it finishes a bit warm from the alcohol.

140,1904,nomomentwasted,4.18,"Had this out of a six-pack last night, and yes, it was my first time having it. For how much good beer I drink, I was always a bit ashamed, but now I've got my chance at it. 2009 vintage.  Appearance: Amber-orange, standard IPA coloration with white head and nice wave lacing. Foamed up pretty billowy actually, and considering the serving temp was around that of a cellar, i was a bit surprised. Looks inviting.  Smell: Very balanced nose, one of the more balanced I've smelled that actually still had a nose to it. Cascade for sure, but maybe some Chinook? Slight spiciness and hint of malt, and the surefire SN yeasty quality. Nothing knocks your socks off, but still friendly and inviting like I like and IPA to be.  Taste: Balance is the calling card here, and this is no exception. For an IPA near 7%, the hops are perfectly in tune with the malt. Cascade piny and grassy hops play alongside a residual sugar sweetness, but the spicier hop blend prickles in with the alcohol that is in no way boozy to make a harmonious little concoction. The taste is relatively light, but it works so well that you have to applaud the synergy.  Mouthfeel: Carbonated perfectly, despite my initial concerns with the degree of head. Finish is neither resinous or too dry, just refreshing and mildly bitter.Spot on.  Drinkability: Went down like a champ. Certainly a beer that begs to have more than one of. The ABV is sneaky thought, and approaching DIPA territory and yet no real sign of the alcohol til after the fact due to the flavors working so well. A tough beer to rate, actually, as the flavors are more mild than some IPAs, but they work so well together that you can't help but admire it. Recommended, like all 2,000 other reviews seem to.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,drperm,4.18,"12 oz pour into an Allagash footed glass.  Ap: Lovely glowing translucent reddish-apricot hue. Thick antique white/vanilla head reduces to nice lacing meringue foam.  S: Up front, something of a malt bomb. Nice biscuit notes with lovely grassy floral hop aroma coming through. As it warms, the hops take over big-time, with a big dry-hop note coming to the forefront. Don't take this one directly from the fridge into your gullet, because you'll miss out!  T: Excellent strong ale qualities (to me this is more of a hoppy strong ale than an IPA). Malty without being sweet, hoppy without turning my mouth inside-out. A slight metallic edge is present, but not unpleasant. Huge dry-hop Cascade action.  M: No complaints here. Fizzy, wonderful fat-scrubbing bubbles would make this great with rich, buttery foods.  O: Not my favorite SN (that one's still the Anniversary Ale) but I have no complaints AT ALL here. I suggest letting it warm up somewhat in order to unleash its full profile. Drink it too cold and you'll miss out on a lot. Excellent on its own; finicky with food (all that dry-hopping, perhaps?), but try spicy Senegalese peanut (curry) soup, or earthy cheeses.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Kaiser81,3.71,"Bought at Vons; poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass  A - Pours a hazy orangish-amber color with a little less than a finger-width of head. there are a lot of visible carbonation bubbles. The head dissipates to a ring on top after a few minutes, and lots of nice lacing is left on the glass. Initially rated a 4.0, 2nd pour done a little more vigorously with lots more head...looks great. Changed to a 4.5.  S - Smells a little bit of pine with some light floral notes mixed in. A touch of malt can be detected to help balance the hops, but not much. Kind of lacking compared to recent IPAs had.  T - I'm getting an earthy type of grapefruit taste with some malt mixed in and a kind of off aftertaste that I can't place. It's not bad, it's just not on the Pliny/Sculpin scale that I'm so used to having.  M - Light to medium body with lots of prickly carbonation...perhaps a tad too much?

140,1904,kzoobrew,4.18,"Slightly hazy orange body leaning more towards the red end of the spectrum. Majestic antique white head towers over measuring three full fingers. Recedes slowly into a meringue like cap, fantastic lacing left encompassing the glass.  Captivating bouquet of hops greet the nose. Largely citrus, more specifically grapefruit, dominate though a complimentary piny aroma fits in well beside. Subtle spiciness and bready malt base is also observed.  Though the hops are certainly the focal point the malt does its best to stand out. Low levels of nuttiness and grain play off the caramel malt to provide a solid backbone. Hop flavors are rather varied. The more juicy citric flavor hits initial, piny flavor picks up mid palate while the more floral flavors tend to linger on the tongue after each sip. Bitterness is assertive but pleasant.  Mouthfeel is incredibly creamy. Medium bodied accompanied with crisp carbonation. Finish is rather dry.  Celebration is definitely my favorite of the Sierra Nevada IPA offerings. Well rounded and above average in every area. Drinks very easily. Great IPA to enjoy as the snow starts to fall.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,StJamesGate,4.13,"Pours a bright amber orange with a stiff egg white head that fades to patches and numerous, webbed rings. Grand Marnier, tropical flower and pine nose. Prickly spice cake malts, almost like Dutch stroopwafel, with juicy candied orange hops and hints of mint and rind. Soft finish but comes back to tighten. Medium, lively, sticky, bit of burn.  Just enough spice in the malts to make it a holiday beer. Manages to be quite distinct from both Anniversary and Torpedo. Fruity, tasty IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,brewerburgundy,4.19,"11/21/10, 2010 vintage, 12oz bottle, nonic. I needed to give this a re-review, score is for 2010.  I'm really not sure how Sierra Nevada would make their pale beers look any better. A glowing copper body in some shade and an organic eggshell head of an inch or more that isn't going anywhere comes standard. And that foam will coat the glass free of charge.  I think the nose is the biggest difference between this and last year's Celebration (and wet hop for that matter). I do realize that the recipe is exactly the same, but the hops from this year's harvest were definitely less pungent. Because of this, the rich, musty biscuit is obvious with orange marmalade and very slight pine and weed hops playing support.  Flavor does follow suite, however pine is more prevalent, as is bitter, oily orange peel. The malt is all biscuit and cake, not caramel.  Such a well crafted beer even in the mouthfeel. Slick and almost heavy weight with spiking carbonation that keep the balance just tipped in favor of hops.  A wonderful IPA that seems more special than maybe it should because it has brothers and sisters that measure up.  12/15/09, 2009 vintage, 12oz bottle poured into pilsener.  Only slightly hazy but brilliant copper. A quarter inch of off-white foam resigns itself to a milky, film. Lots of teeny tiny bubbles. Pretty good lacing for such an oily, dank smell and taste. 4  Your nose doesn't get lopped off by a needle laden branch that you did see coming but there is pungent pine and some citrus peel. Some heavy dank, wet notes. 4  Proceeding immediately to the back of your tongue the pine proceeds to envelope your sense of taste. A carbonation buzz saves you from a pummeling. Residual carmel sweetness, basil, a forest, orange. 4.5  Getting slick with excellent carbonation.4  Another winner from Sierra Nevada. I either love them because I'm from the Sierra Nevadas or because they brew such excellent ale, or both. Even the 6.8 abv wouldn't keep me from drinking three to six in a sitting. Very much like the harvest wet hop. 4",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,sophisticated,4.23,"A) medium hazy amber with mounds of huge fluffy head, excellent retention, and lots of lacing  S) grapefruit, citrus, hops mostly  F) like the smell. Very hoppy, a strong IPA, but not over-the-top in bitterness. Some sweetness and fruit from the citrus flavor and a bit of caramel malts  MF) medium, sticky  D) High! Tasty and different for a winter seasonal. I enjoy IPAs and could have several of these.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,alkemy,4.42,"Slightly dark orange/amber. Pretty cloudy. Big white head with lots of lacing. Lots of grapefruit and pine in the smell and taste. This is kind a tweener in the middle of their Pale Ale and Torpedo. There's a hint of caramel on the back end, but this is all about the hops. It's not intensely hoppy, just a nice steady dose.

S: Hops, caramel notes, spice (earthy like clove or pine) citrus grapefruit.  T: Real powerful and bitter hops. Citrus grapefruit left the illusion of peppermint. The hops are the most evident thing in this Ale.  M: nice light bodied and crisp flow. Good coating and delivery.  D: This is a great ipa, but I couldn't imagine drinking this all too frequently with those overwhelming hops. Great beer, just drink in moderation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Dark gold/amber color, slightly cloudy.  S - Pure citrusy/piney American hop aroma. A hit of malt coming thru (65%/35% hops/malt aroma). Almost balanced. No alcohol.  T - Malt hop blend of flavors. Sweet upfront, fading to very forceful bitterness. Puckering. Flavors are nicely balanced. Clean.  M - High medium body. Alcohol hidden. Fairly smooth. Heavy bitterness, but no grainy astringency.  D - A pure classic American IPA. Nothing too complex. A Christmas staple.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Hazy bright amber-orange, with grainy swirling sediment. Tight soapy cap with floating blobs leaves nice film of lacing.  S: Hops evident upon opening the bottle. Not as strong as it initially seemed, but nice notes of pine, citrusy grapefruit, and grassyness. Faint caramel and bready spice.  T: Big citrus hops, then something deeper, pale and caramel malt, grapefruit peel, bitter finish. Nice balance from a surprisingly round and full malt sweetness. A bit spicy and sweet like a good holiday bread.  M: Medium body, carbonation more creamy than prickly, nice and full in the mouth, but finishes clean with lasting hop scrub.  D: High- great balance! Plenty full and satisfying for the winter, but fresh tasting and refreshing. IPA fans could drink these for a long time without getting bored or tired. A very solid offering from Sierra Nevada.

140,1904,jwhancher,4.5,"Another quality brew from Sierra Nevada. Bought a case this holiday season, and for some reason, this beer tastes quite differently than from what I remembered about 5-6 years ago. Either my palate has changed, the brewery tweaked its recipe, or I'm simply getting older & more forgetful. Anyway, back then I remember this beer to be much spicier & fruitier. Now, it tastes like another quality IPA that Sierra is know for. Not a bad thing by any means.  Definitely has some caramel & pine notes to it. Not overly hoppy. Simply a nice, pleasant drinking beer to savor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,therica,4.62,"I don't understand why seasonal beers that are variations or even totally different get clumped together like this one, but...  11-23-2010 review of Celebration 2010 4.5 / 5.0 / 4.5 / 4.5 / 4.5  Spectacular! A true beer experience.  A= deep orange-amber, nice fluffy slushy off-white head with huge rimming and lacing.  S= massive nose of pink grapefruit and sweet malts up-front, a fantastic bouquet of scents. Various complex hops and malts ranging from sweet into the grassy become very evident. The mix seems to vary depending on serving temp.  T= luscious, nice body with plentiful malts balancing the massive hops, both hops bitters and generous florals are very apparent. Moderate carbonation.  M= a light sparkle on the tongue, plenty of hops to the point of a sting on my lips but also nice chewy malts and bitters.  D= if you like complex hops and malts, beg Sierra Nevada to decide to make this a year-round beer.  === 12-13-2009 review of Celebration 2009 4.0 / 4.0 / 4.5 / 4.0 / 4.0  Very typical West-Coast trendy piney bitter IPA using generous amounts of West-Coast trendy Cascade hops in the wort.  IBU 62 (compared to the standard Sierra Nevada Pale Ale at 37).  A= nice, typical amber copper appearance for a strong Pale Ale, nice head but very little head if poured carefully..  S= pine and caramel malts, with grassy hints, some malts evident when it's warmer.  T= pine, mild florals, caramel, slightly grassy, very nice malts. Nice typical offering by Sierra Nevada although I don't know that it's much different than their standard all-year fare unless it's the extra malty flavor. I guess I expected more of a seasonal twist to the taste, maybe there's a touch extra caramel but not much else of seasonal note. Still of great merit on its own.  M= clean, with slight syrupy effect on the tongue; dusty grassy dry malts that stay around on the palate for quite some time. Mild astringency.  D= very drinkable if you're an IPA fan who appreciates the inclusion of bold malts.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tattooedtolley,4.2,"Nice red/orange color. Huge hop aroma. Great piney hop taste with ample bitterness. Such a great beer that I look forward to every fall/winter. Its pretty much my favorite thing about the season. I love this beer. I remember the first time I ever had it, way back as a real newbie to craft beer and hops and thought it tasted like what I imagined was drinking liquid christmas tree. Kind of comical looking back on it but really, this is a fantastic winter beer and overall, just a fine IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cnally,3.62,"Holiday kind of night tonight. This should be a good capper.  Big orange-red coloring in the beer. An off-white head laces like crazy after its initial rise.  Huge hop aroma, spicy and floral.  The flavor is a little overly bitter, and sour at the tail end. The beer wants to be a hop bomb, but isn't strong enough to really nail it. A bit of fruity flavor in there as well, as it does have some lingering grape and cherry in there as well.  Great carbonation and well tempered mouthfeel for an IPA.  Too unbalanced to make the drinkability level high, but still decent.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,coalcracker,4.32,"Appearance: Pours a medium gold color with substantial amount of carbonation and head. Smell: Very aromatic hop aroma- can detect the piney hops a mile away. A mild spicy aroma also noted. Taste: A nice blend of hops and spice present immediately with a general bias to the hops. The hops taste of grapefruit and a little citrus and magnify at the middle of the sip with an increasing bitterness that then gives way to a smoothness at the end. Biscuit-like and bready malts are there, but are hidden behind the hops. Clean aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Smooth and medium-bodied. Drinkability: Quite drinakble for the ABV and taste. Reminds me slightly of Troegs Nugget Nectar. May be a bit of a surprise for some- as this is the hoppiest winter seasonal I've had.  Overall, a hophead seasonal for sure. Good alpha acid fix.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Lots of white head with a hard pour, slow to dissipate, leavng foamy lace as it goes away. I'm drinking this out of a New Belgium globe glass, and the little etched bicycle is doing it's job.  Smell - the fresh piney smell I expect from Sierra Nevada.  Taste - hoppy with some malt behind it, finishing off noticeably bitter. This is the type of beer I think of when I think Sierra Nevada. I've been more impressed with the recent big bottle releases, but to me, this is not as good as those.  Mouthfeel - medium in the mouth. I get a bit of foamy thickness, but not overly foamy.

140,1904,Ottertude,4.11,Hooray for the Xmas season because that means Celebration Ale is at the local liquor store. A few of these in my fridge has become an annual holiday tradition.  This beer poured a slightly hazy amber color in my pint glass with a wonderful big rich off white head leaving lots of lacing in my glass. This ale looked great. It smelled of grapefruit and pine.  The taste? If you love tons of west coast hops and some warming alcohol you have come to the right place. All kinds of sharp hop flavors such as grapefruit and pine are set for total domination. Just a touch of malt in the background with a little warming alcohol and bitter hops in the finish. This is hitting the spot on a cold Kentucky night.  The mouthfeel is rich and full. At first I thought I could only drink 1 or 2 of these but this is going down easier than I thought. Anybody who loves hops must find this ale in their fridge during the holidays.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,PangaeaBeerFood,4.3,"Served on tap at Croxley Ales in Franklin Square, NY. Was received in a Stellar Artois glass which, though it isn't technically the recommended glassware, looked amazing. Gorgeous dark copper color with a pure white, snowy head. Darker than your average IPA.  The inhale just consumes your nose with hop aromas. The floral and citrus aromas of West Coast Cascades are abundant and addictive, leaving me at the bar awkwardly sniffing away while trying to maintain casual conversation with my friends. I'm not sure if the hop make-up is the same, but the smell very much reminds me of Sierra's Pale Ale, only intensified 10 fold.  The taste follows through, with more similarities to the Pale Ale, but intensified. Very hoppy initially, but pleasantly so, with a burst of citrus zest flavors, which parts momentarily for a bit of sweetness from pale and crystal malts, then finishes with a medium to high level of lingering bitterness. The malt backbone seems emphasizes the crystal malt moreso than the pale, which is atypical for an IPA, but not surprising given the rich color. At the very very last moment of the finish, there is a slight bit of spice, but not the bright hop spice you would expect. It's more of a warming, cinnamon/clove/nutmeg kind of spice flavor. It's very very subtle, to the point where it might completely be power of suggestion, as this is a winter seasonal and it's frigid outside.  The mouthfeel puts this beer somewhere between an IPA and Double IPA. It has a bit more body than your standard Pale Ale, but isn't quite as viscous as the big beers like 90 Minute and Unearthly. Very nice balance.  Drinkability is great. I drove to the bar tonight so I couldn't have more than one. It had enough body, depth and complexity to nurse for a long time without it getting old. However, were it a different scenario, I'd have no problem putting back many, many, many more of these with pleasure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,sprucetip,4.33,"09 edition. And so I add mine to the plethora of opinions on this one, as if it were not already established that this is a great beer. I enter this exercise with a profound bias, this is one of my favorites. Pours clear copper, active, 1 finger white head, great retention and thick lacing. SMELL gets better as it warms, but starts with a strong blast of west coast hops. Caramel maltyness becomes more prominent as it warms. Has legs. TASTE is hop forward, but again, as it warms, becomes much more balanced and smooth. Malty sweetness balances the floral and citrusy hop flavors and the fairly sharp bitterness, which is more prominent toward the finish and then lingers. Some booze is noticeable as well. FEEL rich, rull, viscous, some alcholic warming, dry bitter finish. OVERALL, this is a classic west coast IPA, and one that is very well done. Easy drinking, even sessionable, if you like the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smell: big earthy, somewhat piney, slightly funky hop aroma; complex within its earth-tone context. I like it.  Taste: a pretty big malt flavor with a lot of bitterness to go with it. Well-balanced in that respect; it's big on everything. Hops themselves continue the earthy trend of the aroma.  Mouthfeel: quite good, in fact. A medium body with a nice, near-syrupy persistence, plus a pleasurable amount of carbonation. I'd say it's probably more carbonated than other beers of this style, but I like that face.  Drinkability: for a beer of this ABV and style, it is quite drinkable. The flavors are big but not overwhelming; the balance of ingredients keeps the beer from getting too boring.

Grapefruit and pine are evident with a hard sniff. I am getting some dark sweet caramel like malt.  Taste - Extremely clean bitterness in the form of pine and citrus right up front. A very biting bitterness right there right away. No sweetness to find what so ever, the bitter in this beer is awesome. Bitter grapefruit rind comes though. As it warms a bit of sweet malts come through with a caramel like sweetness.  Mouthfeel - One of the better mouthfeels, very very clean and light on the palate this one is a beauty. The bitterness is what I want in an ipa, I want the bite on the back and tip of my tongue this beer gives me.

A copper brown hue reminiscent of the holidays no doubt, with a rich, ample head quite opposite of a drought.  A snow dusted forest of pine fills the air, deep amidst the woodsy, resinous trees I walked like a dare.  A campfire beckoned with a smell of faint toast, a small hint of malt rose through much like most.  Cold and in need of a drink I did sip, A hoppy-centric brew with toasted malts and froth on my lip.  A swell of bitterness hit my palate which all but did break, but toasted malts, molasses, caramel the blunt they did take.  Aggressive like the blizzard, so much so that I did not desire more, but an enjoyable sipper nonetheless most worthy of lore.  If a heavy mouth-coating, medium/full carbonation and full hops winter warmer you desire, then crack open a celebration ale and sit by the fire.

140,1904,rapidsequence,4.13,"12 oz bottle.  Appearance: Clear dark orange-amber with a huge fluffy head that almost escapes my tulip. Everything looks good in a tulip, but this looks great. Over 10 minutes or so, the head has faded to a thin rim with the exception of a nice thick dollop of foam in the middle. The lacing is about as thick and sticky as it can get.  Smell: Mostly piney hops and a little grapefruit. As it warms, some sweet caramelly malt is there.  Taste: Yeah. Pine and grapefruit with considerable bitterness which gets some reasonable balance from the malt which is sweet in the middle, then becomes sort of crackery. The finish is lasting and bitter. Nicely bitter.  Mouthfeel: Not real full or syrupy. Palate cleansing resiny bitterness. The excellent carbonation keeps it crisp.  Drinkability: This is a really nice IPA. I always look forward to it. My favorite IPAs tend to be those with juicier, sweet citrus hops more so than the piney ones, but that's personal preference. Great beer- bet you can't drink just one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: Smells of pine, a bit of citrus and other strong hops. Very aromatic.  T/M: Hops are very strong in this one. Actually tastes almost exactly as it smells. Carbonation is up there. Finishes a tad bit bitter. Still very enjoyable.  D: Excellent IPA. Very tasty and an all around great beer. I'll be enjoying this one all winter long.

140,1904,fropones,4.43,"A - Clear golden orange with about 3 fingers of beautiful off-white head from a little too vigorous of a pour. Head took a long time to go down to the point where I could take a sip without getting a face full of foam and left beautiful lacing.  S - A lot of citrus and some pine. Typical IPA aroma.  T - Very good citrus flavors up front with a good amount of malt in the back. Not exceptionally bitter.  M - Nice and creamy and smooth with good carbonation.  D - This beer is extremely drinkable. A great wintertime treat. Alcohol not noticeable, and I could drinker a sixer of these no problem. Would probably sneak up on me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Nice head, great copper color  S- Piney, slightly woody hop aroma with a little malt scent  T- Smooth...almost too smooth. Very easy-drinking for a 6.8-er. More hop aroma than taste...easy, not too bitter finish.  M- Silky!  D- Almost done...think I'll head to my local spot for a 22 oz. draft refill! You could probably do a couple of these but I'm sure it would sneak up on you.  This is one of the better seasonals I've had this year. I'm not fond of the big alcohol presence - none of that here. Another solid beer from SN.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,afausser,4.1,"When I reviewed this the first time, I think I severely underscored it, which is the reason for this update.  Appearance: clouded copper and peach-tinged amber, with a huge, fluffy two fingers of head and sticky lacing all over the glass. Starts out with huge carbonation, which slows down but is persistent.  Smell: Sweet pine, hops, light citrus (juicy oranges) and malt notes are all present. The pine and citrus definitely are dominant, but the yeasty notes should not be underestimated. I'm also getting a slight peach hint from it.  Taste: The pine scent is also present in the taste, along with mint, both of which are complimented by the bitter taste of the hops. The citrus in the taste is more grapefruit than orange, though a lemon zest and orange juice certainly come through. The aftertaste is very, very hoppy.  Mouthfeel: Not bad at all, though I'd say it comes across as a little bit foamy in the finish, and maybe slightly TOO bubbly. But other than that, crisp, bubbly, and piney.  Drinkability: Very versatile and easy to drink--at 6.8%, surprisingly so. Glad I picked up a six-pack--but there will be none left to age :(",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tjd112,3.85,"I poured this into a Flying Fish pint glass. Appearance is an deep amber color with white head and some lacing. The smell is that of your average IPA, but when it reaches your palate, it tends to be more of a burnt sugar mixed with hops taste with a slight bit of roastiness. It is a dry beer with a smooth finish, and this is a very drinkable beer, though I wouldn't have it with my holiday meals",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Mit,4.1,This is one seasonal that I have really looked forward to for the last three years.  A-Nice amber colour with a sizable head...rapidly dissipating.  S=Grapefruity hoppy goodness are at the forefront with some minor malt character that I may have imagined(but I had a cold).  T-I found this less of a hop bomb this year and more balanced than in previous years. Not sure if this is so or more due to the fact that I have been drinking Torpedo all year...Either way it's very tasty with a nice earthy hop flavour rounded out by a nice maltiness. Finishes almost spicey.  M-Def in keeping with a 7% beer.  D-The drinkability is ridiculous on this beer despite the higher than norm abv. Had several of these over the course of a night at a friends place and ended up walking home. Totally snuck up on me.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cassanoj,4.03,"Poured into a snifter. Amber reddish with a beautiful head. Yeasty and leaves a lot of lacing.  First I smell the hops, lovely. Citrus, grapefruit, some hints of pine, and maybe some caramel.  Tastes bittersweet. Some hops, banana, grapefruit, mint, caramel. I taste meat, too...crazy.  The mouthfeel is great. Tingly, bitter, stays on the tongue. It's rich and complex but light and refreshing.  Great brew, really complex. I had a really hard time putting my finger on all its components.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,vkv822,3.93,"12oz. bottle into pint glass.  Pours orange, mixed with a slight amber color. Has a frothy off-white head with fair retention and ok lacing. Appears to have strong carbonation. The scent is floral, piney and hoppy and a similar taste to it. The taste becomes a quite prominent mix of resinous pine and citric hops. There is a light but definite caramel malt backing. A very nice, full mouth feel, leaves a slick feel to the mouth, carbonation feels just right. A wonderful winter seasonal.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TheSarge,4.18,"Produces a good two finger thick light tan crown, with a slightly hazy copper colored body.  Aroma is hoppy with pine being the most prevalent trait. Pineapple fragrances are here too, and the malts are pretty well masked by the hops presence.  As far as taste goes, it is sweet in the way of toffee/caramel up front, but is quickly shoved to the side by the ripping of hops, which is mostly citrusy.  Pretty prickly and dry up front, and has a slightly warm ethyl finish.  Overall a good beer, and a treat for the holidays.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,coldwarkid,4.22,"appearance: 12 oz bottle into a nonic pint. Pours a mildly hazy, light caramel colour with golden edges when held up to the light. Moderate pour yields a one inch, creamy, beige head that settles to a decent cap. Leaves nice rings of lace throughout the entirety of the glass as I'm drinking.  smell: pineapple, mango, tangerine, brown sugar coated grapefruit rind - papaya as it warms up! Very impressive dry-hopping. I never would have thought that Centennial and Cascade hops could yield this complex of a bouquet. All very lovely aromas - in fact, probably my favorites, although they aren't too pungent and in your face as other IPAs i have tasted.  taste: Piney with orange wedge and grapefruit pith hop goodness! Not over the top hoppy, but just right for a session IPA. A slightly sweet brown sugar malt character peeks its head in the finish (thanks to some caramel malt), followed by a bitter orangey hop aftertaste, which lingers on just like any other good IPA.  mouthfeel: medium-thin bodied, with prickly carbonation. I would have appreciated a little more body to the beer, but a subtly complex and flavorful session IPA isn't beyond me!  drinkability: A solid session IPA that displays a very delicious hop aroma and taste, along with a little sweetness to carry the hop flavors forward. This is the kind of beer that I've come to expect with Sierra Nevada regular and seasonal offerings: solid, true to style beers that are sure to please but perhaps not to amaze and astound (although I've yet to try Bigfoot).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,callmescraps,4.13,"One of the beers I always enjoyed pre-BA days. So it brings back fond memories, and am always happy to have it again.  Appearance - Nice rich copper/amber color. Two inches of off-white head. It laces nice and thick all the day down. Nice and rocky.  Smell - Very nice rich hops. Some pine, and good citrus. Malt backbone, grapefruit. Very rich.  Taste - Good hop bite. A little sweet up front. The hops come through with good citrus. A honey hint. Some nice grass. It's got a hoppy dankness that I like. Malt supports it well, but it's quite hop-forward. Good fruits.  Mouthfeel - Very nice. Good carbonation, not too thick.  Drinkability - Very solid. Always happy to have another.  This really is a nice little beer. It's a nice change from the malt-heavy winter beers most breweries put out. One of my favorite SN offerings.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MVotter,4.7,"A - The Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale pours into a chalice a gorgeous amber, with a cream-colored one-inch head which leaves thick lacing in its wake as it settles.  S - Grapefruity hops and some roasted malts, very fresh and pleasant aroma.  T - The first impression is of an incredible balance in the flavor of this brew. It starts with a tinge of mild hops and malt flavor combination, and transitions to an extremely pleasant hint of peach. The finish is roasty malts with a combination of hop flavors ... and a sort of sweet citrus/peach finale. WOW!  M - Medium. Plenty of effervescence. Extremely smooth.  D - Delicious. Incredibly drinkable.  This is a masterfully brewed beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,colts9016,4.16,"I got this through my recent BIF, glad to get another beer that I never tried. Poured into a pint glass at 41 degrees.  Appearance: A light tan head that has a little retention. The body of the beer is medium amber color with copper hues. The is a little effervescence with yeast floating in the beer. The clarity of the beer is slightly hazy.  Nose: A very light floral fragrant with citrus esters and pine. The malt has a biscuit aroma.  Taste: A bright floral, pine, and citrus esters. The malt has a bread flavor.  Overall: The mouth feel is astringent, slightly carbonated, and coating. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is full. The beer taste like it has simcoe hops. There is an edgy aggressive pine flavor that is similar to simcoe. It is a super IPA for a hop head.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,blackearth,3.73,"Purchased from Blue Max Liquors in Burnsville, MN. This is the 2006 vintage, tasted 11/28/09. Pours a light copper body with a rocky golden-white head. Aroma is lightly toasted malt and grassy hops. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with spicy malt flavors and sticky, teeth coating hops that produce a long finish that eventually dries out your mouth. I can only imagine how bright the hop flavors might have been from a fresh bottle, but the flavors held up well over 3 years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I seem to remember this beer being more hop forward in the past, but I really enjoy this version as well.  M - hop oils leave the mouth feeling slick. carbonation is moderate  D - insanely drinkable - alcohol is well hidden and this just goes down smoothly",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Offa,4.51,"This is, for me, absolutely one of the best things Sierra Nevada makes. Hoppy it is, but not dominated by grapefruit, and well balanced, with solid, well-rounded character.  Pale, bright copper, it has a very big, pale tan head steadily shrinking to a thin, foamy frothy ring and leaving some nice rings of lace.  Aroma is orange, pine, grapefruit, caramelly raisin, caramelly grain. Grapefruit, though present, is not dominant even amongst the hops, so the hops have a good range of elements and overall it has nice complexity.  Taste is similar, light with grapefruit up front on the first sip, but soon fading into the balanced, complex mix of orange, pine, spicey leafiness, light toastiness, raisiny grain, and caramel underneath. It is overall very juicy, spicey, and aromatic, with alcohol just adding a warm fullness. It has balanced bitterness and sweetness, with lingering, faintly bitter spiciness. The feel is soft and full but light and not quite oily. It is excellent, complex, just assertive enough while still being restrained and balanced, and very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Casey10,4.4,"I figured this was a great beer for this time of year for my 150th review so here goes.  A - Pours a nice orange body small head very nice clear body.  S - Piney, fresh citrus grapefruit perhaps?  T - Really Good I really like IPA's and this is one that I really like the taste not as tart as a Torpedo but delicious none the less.  M - Again good sorta creamy a bit tart after the drink but none the less good.  D - Rate this a 5? Well let me tell you This one is a must buy and have every year and you can not say that with every beer (perhahps) but with this one there is no doubt given the availabilty and affordability.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Jwale73,3.91,"12oz. bottle (2009 vintage) served in a standard pint glass. Poured a hazy amber with a dense, two-inch, off-white head with excellent retention - this is a beautiful beer to behold. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap with thick, semi-concentric bands of lacing forming as the brew recedes. Mild nose - a hint of citrus and some floral hops aromas. Aromas translate to the flavor profile; however a malty character comes out to form the backbone, before finally culminating in a lightly lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a background carbonation that falls just shy of prickly. Sierra Nevada is definitely a workhorse brewery - I'm rarely disappointed with anything I buy from them, and Celebration is no different. A nice example of the style; however, definitely gravitating towards the more bitter end of the spectrum.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Kromes,4.13,"A: hazy deep gold color with large, dense off white head. Great lacing down the glass.  S: A little on the malty side with some piney hop aroma.  T: the grassy and piney hop flavor is the star in this beer, but there is a solid malt backbone that holds up and balances out the strong hop flavor. The beer is bitter in the finish, but it is rather mellow and smooth for the strength of the hop flavor.  M: Pretty good mouthfeel. Nice and smooth and good carbonation. May be a little thick, but still good.  D: The beer is strong, but delicious. Can't have too many as the strong hop does sort of kill the taste buds after a while.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,seand,4.05,"A: Pours a translucent amber with a foamy light tan head. The head dissipates to a thin film fairly quickly, but what sticks around is enough to leave thick lacing.  S: Floral hops with a touch of earthiness. No grapefruit or piny scents as far as I can tell, though maybe a touch of orange citrus.  T: Full of fairly flavorful hops from start to finish. There's certainly some sweetness, but it's just as certainly in the background. The citrus is more prominent here than on the nose, and the finish strongly hints at grapefruit. The alcohol is well hidden.  M: Medium smooth carbonation, relatively full bodied. The dry citrus finish is huge.  D: Drinks easy enough if you like hops, but not exactly sessionable at 6.8%.  The winter imagery on the bottle suggest more of a porter to me than an IPA, but if you're looking for a winter seasonal IPA this beer is worth checking out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cavedave,4.3,"A huge light beige head tops a gorgeous amber brew. It recedes ever so slowly, leaving bas relief lacicles and swathes thickly on the glass.  The smell is all the scents of citrus, lighter pine, even lighter grain and yeast notes. There is a sweetness to the aroma that isn't malty, very clean backbone, with just a hint of earthiness at the edge. Not the strongest, nor most aromatic or perfumed of bouquets, but a pleasant sojourn for my nose on the rim.  This is a beer that bursts with flavor, not tongue-rakingly, nor viscously, but with a clean zing that is delicious, vibrant, and ends well. It starts with a blast of citrus, a bit of citrus rind, a lightly-resinous piney flavor, a sweet breadiness beneath, into textures of earth, bitter, and the less sweet citrus flavors as it finishes long and dry. The finish is drier than the flavor profile suggests, it is lighter in flavor than Torpedo for example, and it is a wonderful sip. The balance is what you expect from SN, which is to say just right.  Mouthfeel is medium body, medium carb, medium viscosity, no off flavors or cloying textures in the cling. Nice.  Drinkability is off the charts. I could drink this non stop until Zelaya is re-elected in Honduras.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Lerxst,4.1,"2009 vintage  A-Pours a nice orange/copper color with a one finger head that fades quickly but leaves some nice lacing.  S-Pine and citrus hops dominate with some nice caramel/malt notes. Smells very good.  T-Pine and citrus hops and a subtle malty sweetness. Not terribly complex, but very enjoyable.  M-Medium body, the carb level is a bit high for my personal preference, but its not bad. Nice dry, bitter finish.  D-Very drinkable, as are all of SN's offerings.  Another job well done by SN. These guys don't do anything badly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,noslenwerd,3.8,"A: Bright orange color, off white head.  S: Smell is strong with this one, but it was a good thing. A little fruity, clean, hoppy.  T: I am not one for hoppy beers but this one just straddled the line for me. Hoppy but the malt quickly covers up the hops. A slight caramel aftertaste with a ton of good carbonation. The more you drink this the more tasty it becomes, and the hops become a bit subdued (a good thing IMO)  Summary: If I am ever in the mood for a hoppy beer I will probably have to go with this one again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,lacqueredmouse,3.87,"Pours a lovely golden orange-red, with a thick head of creamy bubbles. Head disippates, which is a bit of a disappointment, but it still leaves a collar, and some really intricate lacing down the glass. Overall, it looks really quite good. And I do love the colour.  Absolutely delicious nose. Really full and fruity, and jam-packed with those wonderful west-coast IPA characteristics. Notes of passionfruit, pine, sour-cherry, with overtones (possibly from the spices) of vanilla and cinnamon. Really gorgeous nose, balancing between sweetness and fragrance. Delicious.  Taste is somewhat thinner than I would have hoped, and the texture also leaves something to be desired. Some green hop-leaf bitterness mid palate, and a long astringent finish. There are hints of sweetness, but it's never really delivered to the tongue, leaving the palate feeling flushed and not caressed.  It's a pretty nice beer, all things considered, and once again, Sierra Nevada come up with an interesting beer, thoroughly reminiscent of California (to me, at least). I wish it had more body and substance, and more sweetness on the palate, but it's very drinkable as it stands.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mtnbikerpa,4.25,"Poured from a bomber dated 2009 into a large snifter. Foamy, frothy head that disappeared quickly. Left sticky lacing on the glass. Copper, amber color that is very appealing. Pine, grapefruit scent in the nose very aromatic. Taste also hoppy, perhaps cascade hops. I think the hops might be more mellowed than other years. But still none the less a very drinkable beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and sticky a bit oily. I really enjoyed it as it has warmed and the alcohol has warmed me. It paired very well with some BBQ pulled pork sandwiches today.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,wspscott,4.1,"12oz bottle in Sam Adams glass  2009 edition  A: Orangish copper color, crystal clear, thick off-white head, lots of lace. S: Sharp piney hops, a little citrus as it begins to warm up. T: Hops completely dominate the malts. The malts are much more dominate here vs SNPA or SNIPA. A little bit of caramel with lots of base malts (makes me think of british malts) would be my guess. Lots of hops but well balanced with lots of malt. M: Oily hops and a ""richer"" mouthfeel , tingly carbonation make for a nice beer. D: This is a great beer, one I look forward to every year for a change of pace. SN doesn't make a bad beer, this one comes across as a ""little more"", a good way to celebrate. Highly recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Hullabaloo2,4.07,"Aroma - Piney resinous hop aroma. Malt sweetness. Mild esters. Smells like hops just out of the bag.  Appearance - Amber with a nice copper hue. Hazy from the hops. Frothy offwhite head poured two fingerwidths and dissipated to one fingerwidth. Good lacing and head retention. A lot of visible carbonation.  Taste - Immediate piney hop flavor. This is followed by some malt backbone and a smooth bitterness. Like in any good IPA the bitterness dominates, however, it's smooth, not assulting. Also, the bitterness doesn't coverup the hop flavor. I don't know if this beer is dry hopped, but it tastes like it is. The malt really takes a back seat. There is just enough malt to keep the beer somewhat balanced instead of being a total hop bomb.  Mouth Feel - Medium/thing body. High carbonation, but very smooth. No carbonic bite. A smooth bitterness through out. The bitterness lingers.  Overall Impression - The is a good IPA. I can immagine that this would be great pared with some good Italian. The hops would cut right through. This beer is on the verge of just being an assulting hop bomb, but there is some malt and flavor to save it. It's not my favorite IPA, but it's worth buy each year. Try it if you haven't.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,chickencoop,4.23,"This is a holiday classic. Seems a little diluted now, but back in the day, retailers would load up and hoard this stuff for months, now it's everywhere, but still solid.

S - Very hoppy with a decent amount of malt backing. I'll be honest, I never bothered to realize that this was an IPA, so the hops kind of surprised me. Little dark fruit in there too.  T - It's good, but I felt a little let down. Hops, with some malts, not sure I ever really like malts in my IPAs. Decent citrus, slight pine, pretty bitter on the finish.

Reminds me of the golden alexanders I grow in my back yard. The more I smell it the better it gets, now a little gingerbread action.  Trying to nail down the flavor is tough. Right when I think I've got it the hops kick in and beat up my tongue. It's spicy, a tad of citrus, and pretty good.  I haven't always been a big fan of Sierra Nevada, but this version of Celebration is solid. Particularly fun to smell.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Beerandraiderfan,4.39,"Looks like a regular, good ol' craft brew. The smell is amazing. Piney, but not the massive piney you come across a lot more these days with the advent of summit, amarillo etc. . . hops.  Big citrus pine hop flavor as well. Perfectly balanced. This is the best holiday beer in the world. This might be the best beer in the world. A lot of beer geeks probably rate it lower because of its widespread availability.

Hop smell is imminent immediately, the grapefruit and pine being at the forefront of the nose, with a bit of lemon and orange also finding their way in there. Tastes incredibly bitter at first, but the citrus and the hops subside quickly to create a very interesting flavour. The carbonation is a bit strong, but the taste is still quite pleasant. Sierra Nevada is one of the best breweries out there, while they don't make the best beers, they do make the best that you can easily find in your local market (around here at least).

S - Sharp hops with herbal (nearly minty) quality, along with biting citrus and toasty malt aroma.  T - Nice bite of pine sap and grapefruit pith with earthy green tea undertones. Caramel malt and toasted grain plays second fiddle, but makes a solid foundation.  M - Medium body and carbonation with lingering bitter, dry finish.  D - A great cold weather IPA.

140,1904,obywan59,4.2,"2009 Celebration Ale  P: 12 oz. bottle with snow-covered mountains, spruce trees and cabin which is decorated for Christmas.  A: Reddish-copper ale and a substantial head with moderate retention which together reminded me of a Santa suit. Lacing all the way down.  S: The first bottle was fruit and spice--very Christmasy. The second was all hops.  T: Wow! Huge hop presence. The first sip reminded me of my first Arrogant Bastard. A sweet malty character as well, but the hops definitely won out. The sescond beer gave more subdued taste in both hops and malt, so maybe the hops were a bit numbing to my taste.  M: Medium+. Not much oiliness. Very pleasant  D: The first bottle wasn't what I would call a sipper, but it definitely wasn't a guzzler either. I had to pause a bit between swallows. The drinkability improved with the second bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

There is barely a one finger white lace and no cling to speak of.  S- This beer smells like a quintessential west coast IPA. Hops, pine, and citrus.  T- This beer has a nice bold hoppy presence to start the taste. The boldness really never leaves as you get that nice bitter hop flavor all the way through. Very nice hoppy IPA.  I decided to give this beer a try along with their Celebration Ale. This selection is a lot more comparable with the Sierra Nevada regular rotation beers I have had.

140,1904,MaxBrews,4.2,"Sierra Nevada's holiday IPA pours slightly hazy copper orange color with a coarse 2 finger off white head, which gives way to a soapy lacing. An attractive beer but with Sierra making so many APAs and IPAs how does this one stack up.  The aroma of this beer is as hoppy as it is malty. There are pine and grape fruit notes from the hops. Other aromas gathered are green tea, tobacco and fresh bread.  Upon tasting you realize this is a very balanced and subtle IPA. Rather then in your face hop assertion the malt and hops blend together, giving way to piney hops with citrus undertones, tobacco, tea and earth tones.  Bitterness is generally kept at bay in this brew and I'd describe it as an IPA of average bitterness. Body is medium and carbonation is about perfect for any beer.  This is perhaps one of the most balanced IPAs I've ever had. You get all the hoppiness you'd want out of a beer, but with plenty of malt as well. Seems well suited to many variety of cuisines and although an IPA this somehow seems well suited to colder climates.

Unfortunately the smell fades rather quickly.  The taste is quite a bit like the nose. Lots of nice hoppy taste with a fairly smooth and sweet malt backbone. Nice dry finish.

140,1904,davod23,4.46,"An old standard. One of the myriad reasons to enjoy the season. Poured from the bottle into a stemless wine glass.  Beautiful beer. Deep, rich reddish golden color with a billowing white head. The head eventually recedes to a chunky, thin cap, but never goes away completely. The reason this beer gets top marks from me is because of the lacing. Massive chunks of white lace all around the glass. Absurdly thick chunks. Absolutely gorgeous.  Smell is quite floral, with citrus zest and a hint of malty sweentess mixed in. It's not overly aggressive, which is fine with me. Instead of punching you in the face with out-of-control hoppiness, this beer plays with you a little bit. Nice.  Taste is how I remember. A decently solid malt backbone gives way to a well-balanced hop flower characteristic. This beer is interesting in that the hops are very prominent in both bitterness and in the floral/citrus taste, but they don't override your taste buds and destroy your palate. Although assertive, the hop characteristic of this brew is kind of soft and gentle. Weird and contradictory to say it, but I don't know how to phrase it better. OK, maybe I do. If IPAs were women, this is the kind of beer you would want your girlfriend to be. A beer like Green Flash West Coast IPA is the kind of beer you'd want to have a sleepless weekend in Vegas with - bold, assertive, take-no-prisoners craziness.  Mouthfeel is good, if unremarkable for the style. Good carbonation. Dry-ish finish.  I will never, ever, ever get sick of drinking this beer. Never. And at about 6%, I'll never have to.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smelled of citrus and very pleasant floral hops. There was also a trace of spice and feint apple like scent hiding in there. A bit of malt seemed to come through on the scent as it warmed some definite red ale like chracteristics.  Taste and Mouthfeel:Taste was of grassy, piney citrus with a bit of sweet caramel backing it.

A: Deep amber body topped with a tight tan to orange head that hangs high, leaving amazing lacing, and a rocky cover.  T: Light caramel flavor, with just a hint of sweetness. A strong grapefruit flavor takes over as the hops comes into play and ends with a pine bitterness.  M: Light body with medium carbonation. Very dry and a bitterness that lingers on the tongue.

140,1904,xenolithic,4.25,"Poured my 24 oz 2009 Celebration Ale into my dimpled mug with a glorious caramel color with a brownish white finger and a half head. The beer is quite clear and has good light penetration.  I got a whiff of hops. This is my first celebration ale, and I definitely wasn't expecting hops, but I suppose it IS Sierra Nevada we're talking about here. As the beer warms I'm catching more and more the pleasant piny aroma of hops. Smells like the wilderness, like the mountains.  Upon bringing the mug to my mouth for my first sip I *think* I can detect some spices. Some ""wintery"" spices like allspice and cinnamon. On the first taste I pick up big piney notes, which I love.  Typical of a hoppy beer, the mouthfeel is quenching, with a drying sensation as you breath after your sip.  Drinkability on this beer is particularly good. While I'm not a hop head I could definitely see myself going through a few while sitting at my cabin after a long day.  In the end, this is the first time I've had the beer. And while I've enjoyed it thoroughly, I didn't quite get enough ""holiday"" out of this beer if you know what I mean. To me a winter beer means a dearth of hops and an abundance of roasty malts with some spices. Sierra Nevada takes that notion and turns it on its head. You know what? I don't mind that one bit.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,drumrboy22,4.2,"Poured from 12oz. bottle into a New Belgium globe. Beer was an orange color, with a thick, two-finger off-white head. Heavy lacing and moderate carbonation.

I look forward to this one every year. Excellent seasonal brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mpl2,4.02,"12 ounce bottle poured into an over-sized snifter.  A: On the copper side of caramel with a full two finger head that stuck around. As the smooth head (not choppy or rocky in the least) dissipated, it left some serious lacing on the snifter walls.  S: Smells like a bowl of freshly peeled grapefruit next to a smaller bowl of pine needles. A much smaller bowl of pine needles- maybe one on the other side of the room. And in the kitchen someone is making Christmas cookies and maybe mulling cider with a orange slices, all spice, and Cinnamon. And you are just hanging out in the general vicinity of all the goodness. Yeah, sorta like that.  T: The taste nicely mirrors the smell- floral hoppy bitterness up front, but quickly disappears as this is a surprisingly dry ale. I think the one flavor that is missing from the complex scent was the caramel. Despite the hop's victory over the malt, the balance keeps this one in the moderate hop range.  M: I think the mouthfeel is really what makes this such a drinkable beer. Not oily at all and with minimal mouth coating- the taste lasts just long enough on the back of your tongue.  D: See mouthfeel. This is an easy ale to drink and pairs especially well with holiday-themed meals. I think its a fantastic way to introduce folks to good beer, just bring a sixer to your next holiday party. Its also the best beer available at my local 7-11, which means you can pick it up anywhere. It is damn near ubiquitous in the Northern Virginia, DC suburban grocery and convenient stores (despite this, I haven;t come across it on tap yet ... but to be honest, I haven't looked that hard).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The flavor also introduces a nice citrus bite, and a toffee malt sweetness brings a nice balance. The hop bitterness builds a bit as I drink, but this one is certainly not a big, bad hop bomb. It does have a great, complex flavor and is easier to drink than many IPAs. Overall, this drinks like an amplified version of the Pale Ale and is a welcome addition to the Sierra Nevada lineup every fall.

There is a fluffy, thick soap-white head that fades, leaving ample sticky lacing on the glass.  The smell is resinous pine, light notes of sticky citrus, orange peels mostly and a caramel undercurrent.  The taste is all bitter pine and earthy hops, lightly balanced by a citrus sweetness that ushers in a caramel sweetness to balance the flavors. The finish is a very bitter hop, almost like biting an orange with the peel on.  The beer is medium bodied, balanced enough to be very drinkable and hoppy enough to be intriguing. This is another triumph for the Sierra Nevada portfolio, I love their hoppy beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, sporting that beautiful copper color with a nice airy head that provides excellecnt lacing throughout.  Piney aromas, but not much else. I seem to remember more from the nose in previous releases. Hops are definitely upfront, but just a little citrus, which is OK. Bitter hops in the finish too, providing a crispness that adds to its drinkability.  I don't know why I don't just buy multiple CASES of this beer every year.

140,1904,Mavajo,4.33,"I broke the rules a bit and poured this into a Duvel tulip glass. Glad I did...what a beautiful presentation. Pours a brilliant honey amber with a fluffy, frothy white head. It doesn't linger very long, eventually settling into a thin crown but it leaves a gorgeous plastering of lace all down the glass. I had a nice island of head floating in the middle of my glass, but that was due to the laser etching.  The nose is nice, but unremarkable. Pine was about all I could discern, maybe a bit of floral/herbal. Taste has a bit more complexity. The pine is there, but also a pleasant sweetness balancing out the mild to moderate bitterness. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.  The mouthfeel of this brew is nothing short of superb. Wonderful silky smoothness as it swirls around in the mouth. Perfectly carbonated (not something I say very often). Surprisingly full bodied...probably comes in at just a notch above ""medium.""  As for the drinkability...fantastic, simply fantastic. I burned through the first half of this glass before I'd barely blinked and had to make myself slow down.  I'm usually quite skeptical whenever a beer gets the hype that Celebration does, but I was not disappointed in the least. If anything, I think it may actually be underrated. Really enjoyed this brew.

140,1904,ToasterChef,4.3,"Had on-tap at the Great Lost Bear in Portland, Maine. It pours a pretty, clear red with a thin head of white bubbles. It has a very hoppy aroma, with lots of floral and pine scents. The main flavor is of hops. It tastes woodsy at first. The bitterness of the hops begins to take over, lingering after you swallow. There is a smokey, wooden taste that is hinted at behind the hops. Overall, it tastes dry and refreshing. I'm giving the beer a 4.5 for flavor right now, as I believe it will improve as it gets a bit warmer (this glass was served slightly colder than I usually drink and review beers). The dryness and crispness of the beer lends itself to a great mouthfeel. It doesn't coat too much, nor does it tickle your throat as you swallow. I think this is a supremely drinkable beer. I could go through a six pack and not get tired of it. I only knocked it down half a point because I like to have a bit of a malty beer every once in a while when drinking something as hoppy as this. Still, I'm quite impressed with this beer. It's going to be the go to beer for our annual Christmas party this year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Good smell, but it was faint. Citrus and earthy hops with a toasty malt backbone.  The malt, which is both toasty and a sweet caramel, plays a major role in this beer. I would't go as far as saying it was a ""balanced"" ipa, but the malt definitely mellows out the hops. The hops are mostly citrus with a touch of pine. They are fresh.  I really dig the mouthfeel on this one. It's soft and oily, but still maintains a medium body to it. Carbonation is just right.  The alcohol is well masked by the fresh and sweet flavors of the hops and malt.

T: Taste is again quite piney, but with enough of a biscuit maltyness to balance it out quite nicely . Very balanced and very smooth.  M: The carbonation is just about right on for an IPA and the mouthfeel is medium, which I am enjoying greatly.

More than likely, it was my specific beers, so I will give it another try sometime. As for now, I thought I would give it a quick review. Poured a light hazy amber color with a beautiful IPA smell. Perfect amount of hops for my taste and it had a very slick feel in my mouth. I could taste some citrus in there too, which was great. But again, something in the taste, for the two beers I had, just seemed really strange and a tad displeasing. I still enjoyed the beer but the strange unidentifiable flavor kind of left me with a not-so-good aftertaste.

The aroma is fruity, almost berry-like with a good dose of hops in there as well. The mouthfeel runs about medium-to-heavy. The taste is well-hopped with a strong berry hint in the background. It reminds me of an IPA with strawberries. A fairly unique recipe in my opinion and well carried off.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,advill88,4.12,"Pours a orange-amber color with a white one inch head.  The smell is dominated by that great typical IPA smell of piney hops and assorted fruitiness, with some hints of grapefruit.  Taste is a strong slam of hops, with some light fruity flavors and mellowed out by a touch of malt at the end.  Light to medium mouthfeel with a healthy amount of carbonation.  Overall, I'd say that this is an excellent antidote for that hop craving I sometimes get after drinking too many malty winter seasonals. Couldn't drink too many of these in a row because the strong hop profile would overwhelm my palate, but the great taste demands that I go back the the fridge for at least one more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beertooth,4.4,"12oz bottle poured into a Three Floyds nonic.  This beer pours a slighty hazy light amber color and has a nice fluffy two fingers of white head. The foam fades to a thin layer and collar and leaves lot's of spotty lacing.  The nose is a wonderful balance of sweet doughy malts, floral and citrus hops. Grapefruit, orange, warm toast, a tiny bit of alcohol to round it out.  The first sip gives me those doughy malts up front. The bitter citrus comes next and keeps the sweet malt notes in check. This beer is extremely balanced even through the finish. The alcohol is a little warming, but hard to pick up on.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a medium to low level of carbonation.

140,1904,Lothar666,4.08,"Poured from a 24 fl oz bottle into my Rapscallion Snifter.  A- Poured a ruby red amber orange with a creamy off-white head that receeded slowly, leaving a thick lacing on the sides of the glass.  S- Faint hops and floral accents backed with notes of citrus- grapefruit perhaps, but with something spicy sweet in the background.  T- Very strong hop bitterness and an intense flavor of grapefruit in the finish, lending an uncommon tartness to the overall flavor. The tartness plays on the tongue long after the initial swallow. Impressive.  M- The hop bitterness in this brew is impressive, tingling the roof of the mouth and the inside of the cheeks.  D- Goes down surprisingly easy for a brew this bitter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smell: Smell is piney with some malt. Smells more like a double ipa.  Taste: Nice hoppiness with malt to balance it out. Just about perfect balance in my opinion.  Mouthfeel: Very silky, not slick. Leaves almost no bitterness on the tongue.  Drinkability: Due to the great balance and mouthfeel this is a very drinkable beer.  Notes: This is my favorite winter beer. Consistently good with a reasonable price compared to some other beers similar in quality.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Lldeegan,3.86,"Pours a nice burnt orange with a just barely off white rocky head. Leaves a nice lace as it recedes. Creates a beautiful bright orange when held up to the light. This is a really delicious looking beer. Some pine and then a wallop of grapefruit and other citrus notes hit the nose first. Has some sweet initially on the palate from the malt, which transforms into a floral hop flavor with citrus and a mellow bitter finish. It has a pretty light mouthfeel that is even creamy a bit sticky. I definitely had lower expectations for this beer, as I usually do with other Sierra Nevadas. Many people love all of their offerings, but what I've doesn't really jive well with my tastes, most notably the Pale Ale. However, this was a pretty balanced IPA, which I definitely did not expect from Sierra Nevada. I would drink this again and would suggest it to others. It is a nice winter ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S- All I get here is piney and citrusy aromas  T- Sharp citric and herbal flavors give way to bready flavors near the end.  M- Medium-bodied with good carbo. Also, there is some warmth from the alcohol which I might usually object to, but with this brew it really works.  D- Like I said above, some warmth from the alcohol, but to me it really does not get in the way of drinkability at all. Very drinkable/sessionable stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Lunch,3.66,"Served on-tap at Frisco Grille in Columbia, MD (11/18/09) into a standard pint glass at an appropriate temperature.  A: Pours a nice golden brown with one finger of a slightly off-white head leaving behind excellent lacing.  S: A decent aroma of pine hops, citrus, and malt, but all seemed to be slightly subdued.  T: Bitter hopes hit the palate first with a nice citrus and pine flavor leaving behind a decent bitterness that was carried throughout the finish. Again, as with the smell, the taste seems nice, but a little weak.  M: Rather light for an IPA with average carbonation that was a bit creamy.  D: Quite drinkable as this beer was rather mild on the palate and well balanced in a less than full-flavored way.  Overall this was a bit of a disappointment, but with this tasting being my first for Celebration, I will certainly revisit it again in bottle form and adjust my review accordingly if needed.

I picked up a six pack at a Food Lion because i was in the mood for a nice holiday winter beer. I had not actually tried anything yet by Sierra Nevada and this looked like it might be interesting to try.  It poured nice. I large head and good color. But once I smelled it I knew this was probably not going to be a ale for me. Once I tasted it I was very disappointed. This has a very bitter taste. It is almost like drinking burnt rubber.

140,1904,BigMike,4.13,Pours a lovely dark tangerine orange peach color. Nice carbonation and a beautiful creamy foamy white head. Great amount of lacing clinging to the tulip glass.  Citrusy grapefruit and orange. A touch of pineapple and finishes with some caramel malts.  This is one of the most deliciously balanced IPA's i can remember. A great amount of citrus hop bitterness with the near perfect amount of sweet caramel maltiness. This is my first SN celebration ale so i can't compare it to previous years. All i can tell you is 2009's version is terrific.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth. Light feel and goes down super easy. Two things that SN seem to always do well are mouthfeel and drinkability. This one has both.  Drinkability is high. I could drink a lot of these and quickly. Very refreshing. SN consistently brews high quality beers. And for the price $8.99 a sixer.

140,1904,Arbitrator,3.76,"2009 vintage, chilled bottle into a glass.  Last year when I had this I didn't enjoy it; I was not a hophead and I felt it was imbalanced and bitter. My tastes have evolved immensely since then, and while I still won't call this balanced, I can give it more credit.  A: Pours a slightly hazy amber body with orange tones. The head is a finger of cream-colored head that retains for a minute or so before retreating into scattered bubbles on top of the brew and a thick collar. Nice lacing down the sides. That, and its viscous appearance (aided by slow bubbles up the glass) help it look very inviting and rich.  S: Grapefruit rind with a hint of pine needles and spice.  T: Starts off with grapefruit juice and caramel malt, which pulls into the mid-taste. It is then joined by an assortment of floral and spice notes. The finish is lightly dry with a definite pine character. These hop varieties combine in the aftertaste into a lightly bitter, long-lasting finish.  M: I prefer a cleaner finish in my IPAS, but this isn't nearly oily enough to complain about. Medium-full body with a chewy feel to it and creamy carbonation.  D: I'm quite happy having picked up a six-pack of this. It's a good beer and a great value. I'm not sure I'll get more than that; though.

Smells of pine needles, grapefruit zest and toasted crackers.  The mouth is full and bubbly. Well-rounded. This is little harsher than I remember last year's from the bottle. Big bitterness right away that washes away with some light citrus sweetness and honey. My tongue is a little more torched from this, still, I can get through a few of these no problem.

140,1904,Brenden,4.13,"2009.  The color is a hazy bronzed orange. The head pours thick, pretty large, tight and compact, sticking around for most of the time before fading to a thick pillow. Lacing is left in thick, sticky rings and patches. There's lots of IPA character in the aroma, with less malt balance on the nose. Plenty of good, fresh, leafy hops and citrus balance with a subtle note of sweet fruits mingling with rind. I've heard previous vintages were maltier; nevertheless, the flavor, like the nose, has a firm, tasty IPA character to it. An earthy rawness is inherent in the heavily citrus and floral hops presence. There is a light malt to add a light caramel character and some balance. A light toasted grains note makes itself known as well. The body is medium. There's a fairly moderate carbonation leading to a light crispness in an otherwise smooth brew. This is probably a great one to go with if you're not the type who wants a lot of spices or a strictly malty Christmas beer. Otherwise, it's just a tasty, well-brewed IPA that I'd drink any time of the year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Then u get grape fruits and a lemon zest. Also deep in there u get caramel malt notes.  First drink was super hop up front that finished with a burnt finish. Then after the second it mellows out more. You get a pine hop start that finishes with more caramel malt as you continue drinking. But still finishes hoppy. On some sips you also get a boozy finish.  This is a spectacular brew. Perfect for those cold winter nights. This beer will keep you warm. I thought last years release was a bit more maltier. But I'm a hop head and don't mind. You'll be sure to be burping hops out after this one. Very solid IPA!  Thank you Sierra Nevada!  Cheers!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Excellent retention, only sluggishly fading into a thick lasting pillowy cap that coats the glass with chunky rings of soapy lacing.  Earthy floral hop aroma with a nice citrus presence and slightly toasty caramel malt character. Hints of sweet estery dark fruit notes, especially dark cherries. Slight biscuit notes and subtle medicinal undertones. The freshness of the hops really shine and make it complex and truly unique.  Heart, chewy and full bodied mouthfeel which is very hop forward. Lots of fresh juicy floral, earthy hops that lingers throughout over the slightly toasty caramel biscuity malt backbone into a bitter dry floral hop finish. This beer is uber-fresh and bursting with luscious dank oily hops. Subtle citrus notes and some nice earthy pine. Sweet dark fruit notes mid-palate, especially dark cherries, and a slightly medicinal presence. More wonderful fresh hoppiness in the finish without a trace of alcohol warmth.

I drank this beer 1L at a time. I could drink a keg of this stuff if my wallet would allow it. Truly one of the most drinkable IPAs I've ever had. Packs quite a punch, too.

140,1904,drtth,4,"This year's release served in a standard pint glass. A glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: The beer as served is a lightly hazed dark golden amber color with a 1 ½"" off-white head that soon recedes to a nice ring of foam around the glass and a thin layer of foam on the surface. Sipping leaves rings and sheets of foam that cling to the sides of the glass for most of the beer. Later on there is still some lacing left by sipping and the ring persists basically to the end of the beer.  Smell: The aroma is a mix of hops with malts thrown into the mix but way in the background. The hops aromas are predominantly lots of pine resin and some grapefruit zest.  Taste: The bitterness of the piney and grapefruit zest hop flavors dominates the clean crisp flavor but there is not much else here. Although the malt backbone is present it is not really doing much to break up the bitterness, it is mostly there just to support it and keep it from running away with the beer.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium bodied and fresh. The medium to light carbonation persists reasonably well. The finish is long, bitter and dry.  Drinkability: This is a fine example of a West Coast style of IPA without much time in the bottle, which means that it has both the strengths and weaknesses of that style--it has lots of hops and the hops dominate the beer while the malt is well in the background barely making its presence known.

Pours a bright, rich, clear and crisp amber with a huge foamy, sticky, rocky off-white head that deposits large chunks of lacing on the way down. Beautiful.  Hops up front on the nose; oily resin, orange pith, and just a kiss of citrus zest. Strong-ish sweet caramel backbone, which I was able to pick out more easily after recently sampling a 2003 vintage. Entry is an interesting back-and-forth between quite strongly bitter, resinous hops and sweet, rich caramel. Mid-palate is full of herbal, almost minty, hops. Finishes dry with a faint cracker-like malt and lingering hoppy bitterness. Oily on the palate; medium bodied and quite firm.

Slightest hint of toasty malt underneath all that hops.  M - Great carbonation, creamy to balance the bite of the bitter hops plus the aforementioned pine aftertaste.

Kind of confusing, they should only put a year on it if it is a beer that changes annually. Anyway this is my favorite offering from Sierra Nevada and I'm excited to have it in my fridge again.  A - Dark amber/light copper in color with a big 2 finger tan head. Good retention but doesn't seem to have very sticky lacing.  S - Floral hops, slight pine, sweet malt and a bit of spice.  T - Lots of earthy hops up front that lead into a nice sweet malty finish. I love a good piney taste in a winter beer, it just seems so appropriate for the season, and there is plenty to be had here. A tad on the bitter side for an IPA but I like that, not too bitter. Definitely grainy with notes of grapefruit mostly. Has a bit of spice kick in the fairly dry finish too. Fairly balanced but I notice a different flavor in each sip which keeps it interesting. Only complaint is that the alcohol isn't hidden very well. Still, quite a tasty and well balanced IPA and quite original for the style.  M - Smooth and medium bodied. Could stand to be a tad more carbonated.  D - Very flavorful, but a great winter IPA that I could session. I would probably mix in lighter beers in between.  Overall, a very good IPA and one that everyone should try.

The smell is very pleasant; of hop flowers, a hint of caramel malt and mild spice.  The taste is of more grapefruit and less malt backbone than I recall of previous versions. However the hop strength also tastes a bit subdued. Aftertaste is a tiny bit sweet- almost a tad of belgian sugar or spice taste to it, oddly enough. I'm sure its just some winter spicing.  Mouthfeel is light-ish for a winter beer, although average for an IPA-type ale. This beer is highly drinkable and tastes no where near the 6.8 ABV it clocks in at.  I have to say, as a few others have hinted at- it tastes a bit thinner and lighter than previous versions...Perhaps its so early in its life and is so fresh- I'm not sure, but I think it could maybe use some additional aging.

D- It's easy to kill several of these if you like Sierra's hop profile. Still a classic winter seasonal.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,natelocc787,4,"Why does this hoppy beer taste better to me with a few months age on it? Not sure. Very big orange in the nose, tangerine and spruce. Taste is sprucey, floral and grapefruity like an IPA with a big orange backbone. Spicey and herbal notes with a low bubbly feel to it, surprisingly I would appreciate more bubbles and I preferred last years batch to this years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Brez07,3.98,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a SA pint glass  A: Pours a orange/copper hue with a 1/2 finger off-white head. This doesn't last very long. It has decent lacing [edit: had another one and the lacing was much better]  S: Obviously hops present here, but also spice (cinnamon/ginger) and some orange peel  T: Piney hops upfront, followed by gingerbread and minimal caramel. To be honest, I was not a big fan of this at first, but that may have been because it was served cold. Enjoyed this much more after it warmed up a little bit  M: Dry mouth feel. The carbonation gives it a light feel  D: Overall a good tasting IPA. Easily could put a few of these back in a sitting",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bshirley,4.1,"A dark golden with hints of red; small fine carbonation leaving a small and creamy head.  Poundingly floral nose, assertive and slightly resinous.  The taste is dominated by the hops, they're there at every level. Not exactly balanced, with the malt, but it's not intended to be. The malt is still there. The back of the tongue bitterness is almost overwhelming, and the alcohol can be perceived.  It has a nice feel on the palette, but the strong bitterness will numb out the tongue quite quickly. The bubbles are fine and smooth.  For hop-heads, this is an extremely drinkable and delicious brew. And with the alcohol content of 6.8% ABV, quite potent.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Thanks to madtrixter for the trade, a- pours into my left hand brewing glass a clear amber color with some redish/yellowish hues in it, not to much head on this one, s-wow, I wasn't expecting this one to be a hoppy beer at all, I was expecting a malty spiced winter beer and thats not what I got, the only real smell I got was the hops, t- good IPA taste, the bitterness of the hops was fairly well balanced here, m-good d-not bad, overall a good winter IPA to chase the cold away; I guess its god that everyone doesn't fall into the traditional winter ale line up, I'll be trying a few more of these this winter,",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DwnTwnBwn,4.35,Grabbed a few bombers fresh for the 2009/2010 winter. I'll admit the first time I tried this beer I was expecting a darker winter warmer not a delicious IPA. Now its my favored winter ale.  A- Poured into a pint glass from the bottle nice slightly off white 1 finger head. Good carbonation visible. Head stays around to the bottom of the glass lacing very well. Its a nice amber in color and very clear.  S- Very sweet malt comes across with lots of floral hops. The bittering hops have a good grapefruit almost blackberry sweetness to them.  T- There is lots of pine hopyness in the taste with plenty of caramel malts to back it up. Finishes with a touch of light fruit. Finish is good and dry.  M- Medium body and the carbonation keeps it light. Its perfect in the bomber size.  O- Wonderful holiday ale. This will keep we going through the winter.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

No haze, it is clear, the head is thick and yellowish and collapses leaving lots of lacing on the glass.  The aroma is primarily hops but it is way too subtle for my tastes. Mostly citrus like hop aroma.  Time to drink, its a good IPA. There is some nicely balanced hop bitterness in the back, it is not in your face as you might expect. Some sweetness in the front makes it easy to handle. I'm a hop head and this isn't the hoppiest IPA I've ever had but its really good. The bitterness kind of coats your mouth. No aftertaste, but the residue builds as you drink it.  Mouthfeel is good, there is nice palate continuity and there is no real after taste. Drinkability is high. I would recommend this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: spices, hops, on top of a strong lager taste as well as cardboard and paper = oxidation  F: Smooth, then foamy.  D: Better as it warms up. Overall flat and unbalanced, like someone made a bad lager and threw some spices in at the end.  I was really disappointed with this beer and on this review would not recommend it at all. I'll have to try it in bottle form because it's getting such rave reviews - perhaps the keg was just poorly tapped.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jera1350,3.95,"This review is for a 2003 bottle that I picked up at my local store. They had a vertical starting with the 2003 batch.  Appears a caramel brownish orange color with a one finger light tanned head.  Despite the age, this still has a nice hop scent to it. Slightly warm and boozy smell, but dominated by sweet caramel and toffee malts. A little buttery toast as well.  Light bittering hops, but the malts are the highlights in this one. Apricot, caramel, toffee and buttery toast are all present. Really interesting. There is a bit of citrus as well. Pretty complex malt profile. I like the age on this.  Medium bodied with an extremely dry finish. Almost like a tannic red wine. Some active carbonation on the tongue that mellows quickly.  Even with the age, it's still apparent that this is a very good IPA. I will have to pick up some fresh bottles to make my comparison. With the age on this bottle, I'm really excited to try some fresh.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Very tasty and drinkable-A fine ""Christmas"" ale",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,atremains,4.09,"Very nice look to this one. Orange amber with an off white head that boasts some exceptional retention. Lacing is also very good. Carbonation is strong in the appearance. The smell is kind of restrained. Malts and hops. Pine. Taste redeems the smell though, piney hops, wood-like flavor feel to it, malts. The hops linger and give a bit of a nice warming. Malts also serve to balance well, although the hops have more of a say. Creamy mouthfeel with a nice coating of hoppy goodness on the tongue, carbonation is good here as well. This may be my favorite of the SN offerings.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,crossovert,3.8,"Pours an orangeish slighlty yellow amber with a nice fluffy, white head.  Smells like a slightly hoppier SNPA. But it is also malty, it basically smells like a SNPA on steroids.  Taste is pretty lemony with that sorta of meh SNPA bitterness. Some pine gradually hits the taste buds as you go along with the alcohol.  It is a good IPA, not the first thing I think of for winter though, seems like your typical west coast IPA but slightly more pedestrian coming out of Sierra Nevada. 3.00 a bottle isn't bad but there are some more barleywine type IPA's id go for before this one during winter. I like it better than the original SNPA, it is similar but has a bit more body, a bit more character, and a bit more substance to it. It tastes more like a small run brew than the massive operation SNPA is.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cbutova,4.11,"24oz (perfect size, IMO) bottle picked up today at Table and Vine. Pours a semi-translucent orange-amber. Matter can be seen floating in tiny pieces throughtout the whole glass. The head is very nice, three fingers to begin with but dies down to two fingers and stays nice and creamy, very good retention. The head already begins to leave thick lacing down the glass as it dies down. One of the best looking beers I have ever seen. Smell is pretty simple but good. Smells of basically light malts and piney hops, a good balance of the two. Also some citrus can be picked up here too. The overall strength could be a bit higher though. Taste here is also simple and basically the same as the smell. The balance between the malts and hops is great. The huge amount of piney hop flavor reminds me of the holiday season and is very effective. Some citrus can be picked up but it is tasteful and adds a nice element in the background of the pine hops. A downside here is the alcohol will come into play when it warms up and it ruins hte flavor for me, try and enjoy this one while its pretty cool. Mouthfeel is fitting. It is moderate bodied with a decent creamyness, nice medium carbonation and no alcohol warming(when its cool). The hops leave a nice coat on the tongue that will last for a long time after the beer is finished. The MF suits the flavors well. Drinkability is good. The taste is great, the only thing here is the hops that will die down and the beer will taste like alcohol. The price is great ($3.50 a 24oz). I will probably buy this one while it is out for some good sessions to come.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,aerozeppl,4.1,A: Slightly hazy copper color. A half finger of white head with some very impressive lacing.Visible carbonation.  S: Hops and I expect nothing more and nothing less from Siera Nevada. Has a little bit of spice to it.  T: Now it reminds me of a torpedo light with a touch of spice to it. How do they get that touch of spice? It is one of the most boring and great IPAs out there.  M: Very fresh mouthfeel. Nicely carbonated. Little bit sticky.  D: I remember having this beer about 10 years ago and I hated it. It tasted like a poinsettia to me. Now I want a keg of this in my house. There is a reason this has been around so long and is so popular.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Head dissipates fairly quickly, leaving a thick collar around the glass.  S - A nice mix of spicey and citrusy hops with some pine mixed in. Grapefruity and piney with a touch of caramel malt in the background.  T - Sharply bitter, a good blend of citrusy hop flavor, pine, grassiness, light caramel, a touch of alcohol.  M - Fairly light in body, gives a thin mouthfeel. Good carbonation that seems to bring the bitterness to the forefront. Mouth feels tingly after the swallow, like there is some residual carbonation left behind.  D - One of my go to beers in the fall/winter. This is an extremely drinkable IPA for me. Plenty of bitterness, tons of hop flavor and really well balanced, and at 6.8% this one won't kill you. Good winter all day beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BigDank,4,"Pours into a Slaapmutske glass a not too hazy medium amber with a tall creamy white head that is slow to dissipate, leaving a heavy lacing all the way around. The hops jumps at nose right from the pour. Slightly floral scent but not extreme. The taste is mellow, bitterness is medium. Not much of a bite to this one but to some that is a good thing. Carbonation is medium to high giving the hops an extra boost. Drinkability is good and I would say this would be a good one to drink on any occasion. Would be nice to drink a few on a cold winter day, just could use a little more alcohol. You know, for the warming. :D Overall one of the best offerings from this brewery.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Something to look forward to every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TommyW,4.5,"A- Slightly hazy gold body with a big, bubbly, off-white head.  S- A note of toasted malt but the mild-grapefruity hops really dominate the nose.  T- There is a brief taste of malt but then comes in a nice mix of hops ranging from a mild grapefruit to floral to almost tea like. The hops leave a short, lingering bitterness.  M- There must be a higher malt level (although not so noticeable in the taste) because this brew has a nice full feel to it. Nice carbonation as well.  D- This is definitely a great IPA to turn to during the winter months; the nice full feel makes it comforting when it gets cold out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ocelot2500,4.5,"Pours a clear copper, amber color with a nice rising off white head. Plenty of lacing on the glass.  Smells of a big delicious hop aroma. A big pine scent with some citrus and earthy notes.  Tastes of the big hops upfront with a solid malt backbone. The hops are a big chewy pine with some citrus. Plenty of bitterness to this one. But the malt is able to hold its own and has a nice toasted bread undertone to the whole brew.

140,1904,OldYoda,3.78,"2009 version. Poured from the bottle into my Duvel goblet with an nice head and some lace. A very pretty dark copper color.  Smell is more subdued than I expected from other reviews, and not nearly as hoppy as I expected. Some citrus and pine but also a nice malty character.  Taste closely follows the smell. A very well balanced offering.  Mouthfeel is clean and crisp with a nice bitter finish.  Drinkability is fine - several of these would be just fine with me.  Note: I like this better than last year's version.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PaleAlien2,3.86,"Pours a beautiful copper color with a HUGE cream-colored head. Maintained an almost one-finger head the entire time I drank it.  A little disappointing in the smell department. Hops come through strong, but not much else.  Classic American IPA. Huge hop kick in the finish. Hop spices tingle the tongue long after swallow. Some citrus notes in there too. Quite good.  Medium body. Mouthfeel is just right.  I downgraded it a bit on drinkability just because of the hop factor. It burns up the taste buds pretty quick.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,drunkboxer1,3.7,"Deep gold pour into a pint glass. Oily looking bubbles. Smells a little sweet, like pale malts. Also a good amount of hops. I honestly forgot this was a IPA, despite the fact that I know I've had it a few years ago. The bitterness isn't overwhelming, but its there. Hop flavor dominates. Definately some piney american hopes in there. There may be some British hops, giving some earthy/metally flavors. Can't really tell right now. Not bad. I think I like their torpedo a little better.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dmamiano,4.2,"Pours a deep copper with a two finger head after a hard pour.Well carbonated as co2 leaps out of the glass.

140,1904,BarrelO,4.12,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 2009 vintage.  Ruby red body with a big white head. Smell is completely dominated by citrusy hops. The taste is another matter altogether. This is surprisingly malt-forward for an IPA, with the hops just kind of lingering in the background. It's very good overall, but it doesn't really feel like an IPA to me. I think of it as more of a mini-barleywine or hoppier than usual old ale. That's OK, though, since when I think of the holidays, ""hop bomb"" isn't really the first thing that comes to mind.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beerwolf77,3.6,Well the label looks like christmas so I will say this is my first christmas beer.  Poured into my chimay goblet the beer is dark orange brown. The off withe head is a least an inch high and fully envlopes the entire top of my glass. Lots of sticky lace clings around the rim after a brief rest.  The aroma is very hoppy. Plenty of grapefruit and pine sap. Some maltiness is there as well.  The flavor is subdued hops with loads of malt. Some grapefruit but not overloaded. The bready wheat cracker malt takes the reigns and drives this beer.  Medium body light carbonation. Nothing real noteworthy in the feel.  Overall a decent beer. I'm not sure what sets this apart from every other AIPA. Drinkable.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ImusBeer,3.57,"I've had a few of these for quite some time in the beer fridge. There was a bit of sediment on the bottom which got into the glass since I wasn't really looking for it.  It poured a copper-gold color with an off white head, about two fingers that stayed for quite some time and died to a small quarter inch that stuck around. There was a bunch of lace that accumulated on the glass as I drank.  My daughter even voiced that the pine sap aroma was quite strong. Also sensed some citrus in there as well.  The taste was dominated by bitter pine and all the hops you would expect. The mouth was bitter with a very dry aftertaste, what you would expect from a nice IPA and why it is one of my favorite styles.  It's a little too much bitterness for a session beer but a really nice and enjoyable brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,IPALOVER,4.85,"It's my favorite time of year again-- Sierra Nevada Celebation Ale is here! The 2009 version poured as beautifully as ever into a pint glass. The bottle had a bit of sediment at the bottom, so I poured carefully and stopped with about 1/4"" remaining.  The first sip was as crisp and hoppy as I remembered from last year, and the year before that, and...well, you get the idea. It's the reason I only drink this beer from now until I can't get it anymore in February! The hops are floral but are balanced by an earthier or maltier quality. As the beer sits and warms it only gets smoother and tastier.  This is the perfect, hoppy beer for drinking one after another on a cold night. It can't get much better than this beer in my book, but I am an IPA lover!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BlackHaddock,3.02,"Brown 2008 bottle, with 350ml of beer for 69 pence from a cut-price store in Wellington, Shropshire, couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them lined up on the shelf.  I poured it into a 'Hoegaarden Grand Cru' stemmed tulip glass, why not let it live a little before I drank it?  I allowed the whole bottle to enter the glass, so it looked a dull dark orange colour and was obviuosly cloudy. The head was a frothy off-white pile and the beer looked cool in its unfamilier glass.  Hops, hops and hops hit my nose, some yeast smells tried to get out too.  In the taste the hops took over again, wave after wave of them, nothing else could force its way through, a dry bitterness from the said hops appeared to be unchecked, but a slight fruity flavour (apples, pears and berries) did turn up in the aftertaste.  Plenty of body, not rich or creamy, just body.  Pleasant, but just a bit too hoppy for my palate.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kurp001,4.35,"12 oz. bottle bought at Beltway Fine Wine  Pours a bright amber with about one finger of off-white rocky head that gradually dies down, leaving a fair amount of lacing.  A grassy, piney hop aroma is the predominant thing that comes through on the smell. A faint barley character is detectable somewhere in the background.  Taste features a well-rounded hop punch upfront that offers a sustained bitterness throughout, although some vague biscuit malt hints start to make their presence known midway. The finish is again dominated by the hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with a perfect amount of carbonation for the style--not too aggressive, but enough to keep things interesting.  Celebration Ale is very drinkable, in my opinion; the hops are not overpowering, nor is the supporting malt backbone. This is my first Celebration Ale of the season, and I feel that I've been reminded once again of one of the many reasons I love winter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Mistofminn,4.3,"The last time this brew came around, I wasn't into IPA's enough to bother trying it. I have come a long way since then (a very long way...) and I'm glad to say I finally got the chance to try this.  Poured into my Town Hall tasting glass. Surprisingly light golden amber. Clear to the naked eye, but when held into the light, you can see suspended sediment and tiny floaties all over. Nice smooth and creamy light tan head with good retention. Leaves nice lacing all down the glass.  The nose is nice and hoppy, so glad I can try this fresh. The hops are a subtle battle between floral and fruity hops against piney and earthy hops. In the end, I think the floral hops slightly out-duel the earthy hops in the nose.  The taste kinda goes the other way, in that the earthy piney hops win out over the floral hops. There is a light sweet malt backbone in between all the hops. This is some tasty stuff, can't imagine I would have enjoyed it a year ago, but at this point I'm realizing I was missing out.  Mouthfeel is a little lighter than I would have hoped, but it has a nice appropriate carbonation level. Easy going down with a light lingering bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is great, this is the ultimate session brew, and a great IPA for the holidays.  I'm glad I went for the whole 12 pack, rather than just a sixer. But then again...I have a feeling this 12 pack isn't going to last long...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Maybe I've been spoiled by darker, sweeter, heftier beers, but I was really disappointed here.  Its a tasty session beer for not too much money. Its vaguely spicy, and is (as SN Pale Ale is) a well balanced IPA.  It is not going to change your life or make you think.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ditch,4.21,"Poured a beautiful cloudy red copper with a thick, two finger foamy, chunky head that fades slowly to a thin coating across the whole goblet. Lacing sticks all the way down.  Smell... ahhh... tart grapefruit and a sweet sweet background. This is the aroma of a perfect IPA.  Taste mimics the smell for the most part. The sweetness hits first followed quickly by the grapefruit and then a slight spice with a piny tang that hangs around minutes after the last sip. Delicious!  Mouthfeel is great. Perfect carbonation to meld the flavors together in your mouth and bring out the aroma. Not as oily as some IPAs can be.  Drinkability is very good. I could probably drink this all night. Not light enough to drink a sixer in one sitting, but I could probably do 5. =)  Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cerveza5150,3.16,"OK, this isn't on tap, it was in a bottle, but I can't save multiple years on beeradvocate. This review is for the 2009 edition.  A: Typical Celebration Ale rosy red hue. Cloudy, with small bubbles of carbonation. Lacing all the way around the glass and a soapy, off-white foam head.  S: Slightly alcoholic, citrus fruit on the nose. The caramel malt pokes through on subsequent tries.  T: Celebration Ale has, and always will be, a celebration of hops. I think the 'alcohol' that I thought was present on the smell, was actually some of the aromatic phenolic compounds in the hops. The malt is there (I think I have it a bit too cold, probably low 40s - it might shape up a little better if I let it warm up), but it has a hard time competing with the hops. It's not that it's unbalanced, it's just that it's really close to that line of being too hoppy and not sweet enough.  M & D: The mouthfeel is awesome, but I held back on giving this thing perfect scores due to the somewhat extreme nature of this ale. The hops and malt are a bit pushed to their limits. It's not bad, but it is an acquired taste. Celebration Ale is one of the few beers that I think has the potential to start at a perfect 5, but then loses points due to one or more factors of the ale being overbearing. This ale is what it proposes to be. A celebration, fit for warm winter months. It's not for everyone, but then again, what ale is??  P.S. I actually drove 140 miles round trip this afternoon to pick up 2 cases. This didn't disappoint, and I can honestly say my holiday season has started!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MetalHopHead6,4.38,"Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale poured a deep color that was just on the red-side of copper. There was a thick two-finger head and the glass was left with rings of sticky lace.  The smell and taste were citric and bitter, like tart grapefruit. The smell popped, seeming to fill the room, during the pour, and the taste got more complex as it warmed. The feel was perfect, aggressively filling the mouth and lingering on the tongue.

Ive always been a big fan of SN. During my second review of this I can go back and say this was the main staple of my entire Winter beer drinking. Probably have picked up over a dozen times.  Awesome large 4 finger dense pillowy head. Retains really well, and only slowly subdueing. 5 minutes later is a thick unever layer atop. Pretty good amount of sticky lacing thats clinging. Great looks. Best described as dark strawberry mixed with golden-orange .  Very hoppy, malty smell with some citrus  AWESOME tasting, good dose of hoppiness. I thought it would be a winter type ale (when I first tried it) but I didnt know It was going to be just an amazing IPA.  Mouthfeel is medium body with really nice carbonation that goes down well and nice on the tongue.  Drinkability? I loved this beer. I finished the 6 pretty quick. Im going to def. buy again.

The aroma doesn't lie. The first sip is an incredibly awesome pine hop attack that is well balance with a solid malt backbone.

140,1904,SpdKilz,4.1,"New beer Friday!  Appearance - Pours a great looking hazelnut color with about two inches of head which dissipate in a few minutes but leave nice, chunky lacing.  Smell - Honestly the first thing that pops in my mind is this smells remotely like an Arrogant Bastard (no joke). From the aroma I can gather hops, pine, a b it of citrus, but honestly I smell spices after the initial sniff. This is followed by just a tad of sweet, biscuity malt smell.  Taste - A bit bitter (again, for some reason this initial taste reminds me just a bit of Arrogant Bastard) , hops, defiantly some pine, and some citrus such as orange peel. After the initial flavor a malty backbone appears and finishes crisp and a bit bitter.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied and fitting carbonation. I can feel the hop oils slide on the tongue just a little bit. Pleasant.  Drinkability - Remarkably so. I could session the heck out of this thing. At almost 7% abv and at sixteen dollars for a twelve pack, this is a relatively cheap, great tasting IPA. I will admit, I was hoping to taste more spices seeing as this is a ""Christmas"" beer...I guess I will get my fix with SA Winter Lager and Ole' Fezziwig for that! But overall a great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,brokensail,4.28,"Just picked up a sixer of the 2009 release. I love this beer, so I had to grab some.  A: SN Celebration pours a hazy amber color. It starts out with about a finger of off-white foam that dies down to a thin layer. There is excellent lacing on the glass.  S: The smell is full of citrus hops and has a fairly big malt backbone. This is not quite as aggressive and powerful as your typical west coast IPA.  T: The flavor is a bit more assertive than the nose. It starts off with a nice dose of citrus and piney hops, and has a nice crisp, bitter finish. There is still a solid malt component to this, beer however.  M: A rather full body for an IPA, with the carbonation is on the light side.  D: This beer is quite drinkable, but hits surprisingly hard for 6.8%.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,brow1901,3.98,"A- Nice big three finger head after a violent pour. Color is a nice orange amber with a bone white head. Good retention and great lacing.  S- Lots of piney hops. That is the so most obvious, something about the smell seems to remind me of a pilsner. Maybe the used some pils malts or a special yeast or I could just be crazy. I like it though, not overpowering, some complexities.  T- Bitter hops, no citrus or earthy hops just bitter. Strong malt backbone sorta shines through the hops in a nice way. Very different from a typical IPA especially a west coast IPA. Crisp and clean taste.  M- To light for my tastes, instead of being refreshingly light it just feels sorta watered down. Good carbonation and leaves the mouth a little slick.  D- Highly drinkable, right in the average range for an IPA, in my opinion this beats the pants off any spiced winter beer. And the name is PC too.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jhoban19,4.06,"12oz. bottle, 2009 edition, just picked up a sixer today.  A: this is one inviting brew. brilliant orange/copper color with loads of tiny bubbles that create a bit of haze. solid white foam that lingers and then settles into beautiful ring present all the way down to the last sip. the lacing sticks to the glass and stays right where it landed- no movement what so ever. just a wonderful looking beer.  S: nice balance of sweet bready malts and citrusy hops, mostly grapefruit and pine, with a bit of orange. detecting some subtle hints of dark fruit but I can't quite put my finger on what it is. not quite cherries, not quite raisin... luckily I have 5 more in the 6 pack to try and figure it out!  T: more of the same- nice balance of citrus/pine hops and the sweet malt. excellent hop bitterness and toasty malt on the back end.  M: crisp and a bit dry on the finish, with a bit of fizzy carbonation that tickles the tonsils. medium bodied with just enough alcohol to make you take notice. hop bitterness really lingers throughout the entire pint.  D: I look forward to Celebration Ale every year. the 2009 version is a well crafted IPA and I'm looking forward to enjoying the rest of the 6 pack. it's not quite as smooth as I was hoping it to be, but a damn fine IPA that doesn't disappoint.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mikey711,4.27,Winter has arrived with the 09 celebration ale  A: A deep orange with a thick white foam head. Not much lacing and good head retention.  S: Oily pine hops and caramel sweetness. very fresh and pleasant  T: Bitter and piny with a good amount of sweetness to balance it out.  M: Full bodied and creamy.  D: I almost finished an entire six pack last night. Very tasty and very enjoyable all around.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TheViolator666,4.33,"12 fl. oz. bottle poured into pint glass.  A: Pours a nice light amber color with a huge bubbly white head that simmers down to a fingers-width cap. Leaves beautiful layers of lacing.  S: Smells of citrusy hops as well as some grapefruit and pine, touch of sweetness from the malts.  T: Similar to the smell, the taste of this one is powered by citrusy and piney hops balanced incredibly well by a malty undertone and aftertaste.  M/D: Nice medium body with perfect carbonation and high drinkability.  Overall, a very nice standard American IPA that is balanced very well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bsp77,4.83,"Ah, it is that time of year again. Actually, it is a little early, but screw it, I want me some Celebration.  Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint.  Appearance: Rich reddish-amber with large creamy head and very nice lacing rings.  Smell: Citrus, grapefruit, pine, spice and semi-sweet toasted malts.  Taste: Perfect balance of pungent hops (grapefruit and pine predominately) and slightly sweet toasted malts that are reminiscent of a Red Ale. Turns bitter and spicy at the end.  Feel: Moderate carbonation, smooth medium body with a long dry finish.  Drinkability: My favorite IPA, although Stone and Two Hearted are damn close. Even though the balance is superb and it is immensely drinkable, I just can't quite give any IPA a 5 on drinkability due to the bitterness.  Edit from 2010 release: this does deserve a 5 on drinkability.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bump8628,4.41,"Bottled on date of the 267th day of 2009 (Sept. 24, 2009). 1.5 12oz bottles poured into an Imperial pint glass.  A rich copper, bordering on amber, beer with 2 fingers of dense white head that rises over the rim of the glass. The head transforms into a thick meringue-like froth that sticks to the sides of the glass. I can't imagine how this could be a more attractive looking beer.  The aroma is classic pine and citrus American hops. A soft sweet barley smell comes through at the end hinting at the perfect balance of this brew.  The hops are the first thing that hit the palate. Pine, citrus peel, and floral flavors rush over the tongue followed quickly by a solid caramel malt backbone...beautifully balanced. The hop bitterness is solid but doesn't linger on into the clean finish.  This beer is my absolute favorite seasonal beer...meaning any season, any brewery, this is it. I easily go through 3-4 sixers of this every year. Strong, hoppy, but supremely balanced. Screw the over-spiced holiday ales that invade the shelves this time of year, give me a Sierra Nevada Celebration!  P.S. Drink it fresh! And long live the poinsettia-covered label.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Dspohn,4.32,"12 oz bottle, 2009 batch, super fresh, reviewing from notes taken last weekend.  A. Nice bronze/copper body with a couple inches of tan head.  S. Delicious grapefruit smell with a hint of pine and bready maltiness.  T. Bitter hop flavor of orange/grapefruit with some pine lingering. The malts seem toasty and biscuity with a slight floral spice to it that I cant identify. Finish is smooth and hoppy.  M. Nice smooth medium mouthfeel. A nice robust winter IPA.  D & Comments. My favorite selection from SN. I think the hop profile in celebration beats out torpedo. Overall a great fall/winter beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BB1313,4.24,"12oz bottle from the 09 batch. This was literally FRESH. Hops were very present. Very nice head and lacing. Poured a color similar to honey. This is a very spicy IPA; extremely bitter. You can definitely tell this is a SN beer. It went down almost too smooth. I really like this batch, great on a cold night.  This is a classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Procrastinator,4.38,"12 oz. brown bottle with 8 28081642 noted on UPC label. I've had this beer 12-pack after 12-pack over the years. This is my first review of it.  Appearance: the body is a hazy copper color with a yellowish, soapy, yet creamy head with bubbles of differing sizes. As the bubbles explode, the head becomes craggy and lacing holds together a web of delicate foam. Carbonation is extremely active as bubbles dance off the glass bottom.  Smell: the scents have somewhat subsided since this beer's suggested date of enjoyment, but piney hops seem to hold on while a slightly sweet caramel maltiness brings around a completeness.  Taste: the piney hops are still the predominant factor, while subdued, still have qiute a bite. The caramel malts, while sweet, are definitely here to show balance, though slightly still to the bitter end.  Mouthfeel: as with most SN beers, the mouthfeel is delightful with adequate carbonation and a more than medium texture. The slight astringency is showing that these bitter hops never die.  Drinkability: this is always a wonderful beer to drink. Even many moons after the month of ""Celebration"", this one's a keeper.  This review is from notes several months old.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,velosuds,4.18,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a clear pint glass. No freshness data on bottle.  A-Poured an orange-amber hue with a two+ finger head that receded into a modestly sticky lace.  S-Piney and citrus hops, but nothing especially prominent. Also some biscuity malt.  T-Hoppy bitterness with a nicely balanced malt sweetness I find very pleasant.  M-Very smooth and well balanced. Nice carbonation level.  D-This went down very easily and I would readily reach for another.  A very good IPA. I like this better than their Torpedo. Would drink again. Would buy again, depending on what else was available.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,lester619,5,"This is the stuff that expanded my mind beyond high life light from the can. It looks fantastic. Deep, dark copper to amber brown. Gigantic creamy rocky head. Lacing that slides down the entire side of the mug. Perfect. Very fragrant fresh hop smell. I've never been to a hop farm at harvest time, but this is what I imagine it smells like. The taste is ideal for an IPA. Thick, chewy bready backbone. Understated sweet toasty caramel malt with the perfect amount of fresh complex oily hop bitterness. It doesn't go too far with the hops and produce a bitter aftertaste. Again, perfect. This is hands down my favorite beer. It might be my favorite part of Christmas.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,donniecuffs,3.78,"Poured into a pint glass. Dark copper, almost reddish hue, with an average head, but good lacing. The smell was surprisingly dominated by hoppy pine and citrus, and an ever so subtle apple essence. I was expecting more spiciness for a winter warmer/ipa. The taste did reveal more biscuit and maltiness, but it was also still heavily dominated by pine and citrus. Nice medium body and little carbonation resulted in a beer that rolled smoothly over the tongue. Drinkability was certainly apparent, but again, I was unpleasantly surprised by the lack of spiciness for a winter release.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GregSVT,4.23,"Poured a 2008 bottle into a New Belgium 1554 glass.  A: Pours a hazy amber with a big white head that reduces to a small layer and leaves a great deal of sticky lacing on the glass.  S: The smell is intoxicating...almost resembling a DIPA like Hop Stoopid. Hops, fruit, and a bready malt aroma jump from the glass.  T: The taste mimics the smell with a lot of fruity hops and the malt backbone. Great stuff. I'll have to say that aging the bottle mellowed the hops and let the fruity/malt flavor come into play a bit more.  M: Very bubbly and slick. Again much like Hop Stoopid but nothing like a really thick DIPA.  D: I really like this and the aging has done wonders for the flavor. The slightly lower ABV makes this a bit better in the drinkability department than something higher but not much.  Back when I bought this I thought the hop flavor was way too over the top but it seems to have mellowed dramatically. It also could be that I wasn't a fan of IPAs/DIPAs but I've gotten into them a bit more this year after finding some exceptional examples. I look forward to putting another 6er of this away this year to try around the same time next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GRG1313,3.65,"Pours a dark amber color with a thick white firm lasting head.  Nose is very yeasty, assertive and pleasant; nice bread nose character.  Flavors are strong citrus/pine hops with a little malt. Nice hints of pine. Pleasant and drinkable, although very predictable.  Long bitter hop finish.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tdawgydog,3.83,"Had two of these sitting in the cellar since last Christmas, thought it was time to make way for this years seasonal brews... Poured the 2008 Celebration Ale into my Maudite Goblet.  A - Pours a nice copper red color with a good two finger head that dissipates to almost nothing with a decent lacing left around the rim of the glass  S - Strong Hoppy scent with a little bit of oak barrel scent. Something that you would definitely look forward to on a cold winter day.  T - Strong Hop taste, otherwise a slight cinnamon and biscuit taste.  D - Enjoyable as long as your not mixing and matching. I could have a few of these to warm the soul on a chilly day. They don't go well if your sampling other beers. Stick to these if that is what you like.  M - Good body, I'm not sure that I notice any difference after cellaring the beer for 10 months.  Definitely one of my favorite winter warmers. I hope this years is as good as last.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ipazilla,4.35,"I had this beer in a 12 oz. bottle at a Christmas party last year it was excellent and went well with a spicy venison chili that was served.

140,1904,thepeter,3.97,"I found this at the supermarket a couple years ago, bought a bunch, put the last one in a box and forgot about it. This is a 2007 bottle poured into a British pint glass.  A - pours the color of honey with a huge bouncy overstuffed mattress of a head that stuck to the glass and would not die. It eventually shrank into a dirty meringue ish cap on the top of the last few sips.  S -Lot's of fruit! Citrus, apples, maybe even some lychee fruit. Also, obviously some hops and a bit of sweetness, maybe honey.  T - Flavors were definitely subdued. Light on the hops, but could still taste the citrus and pine needle flavors. The finish was sticky and bitter with a small amount of metal coming through.  M&D - Smooth, full bodied and very nice carbonation. Could easily drink a couple more and would, if I could ever find them.  Still prefer this one fresh but glad I had one sitting around to try with some age on it. In the end everything was great, the flavor had just faded which is to be expected of this style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,drummerben,3.75,"On-tap at Taco Mac Metropolis.  Celebration 08 recently tapped as part of Christmas in July. Nice amber color, very little head. Floral fragrance with pine and hops. Taste is much less hoppy than when first released, as the hop character has faded, but still a great balanced taste. Tastes of pine with grassy notes and a malty backbone. Very easy to put these away in short order.  This one is still great with a little age on it. Probably a good option for those who considered SN to be too hoppy, if that's even possible! The age downgrades a great beer to really good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BWMKappaSig,3.8,"2007 Celebration Ale, aged 22 months at 45 degrees.  A: Cloudy deep honey-amber with a thin off-white head.  S: Citrusy hops and mildly sweet malts are a pleasure on the nose.  T: The hops have severely dimmed over the time it was aged. The malts aren't as sweet as the smell indicates, but do help to balance the hopiness. A slight cardboard taste indicates some oxidation, but the starting point to this beer was clearly a strong but well balanced west coast IPA.  M: Medium bodied with a little bit of sticky hops notes on the roof of the mouth.  D: I wish I'd not aged this so long, though despite its age, it is still well done.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,FtownThrowDown,3.92,"2008 Bottle.  Pours a dark amber in color with a slightly frothy head. Tons of floaties suspended throughout the beer. Smell is hops. Piney and grassy hops. Still a good amount of bitterness in the flavor. You can tell that this has some age on it, but it's still drinkable. There's a god enough base beer underneath that when the hops start to fade, you're still left with a solid beer. Medium in the mouthfeel and fairly drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PartyBear,3.55,"A - A cloudy ruby red, with a creamy white head.  S - Complex smell. Hoppy, with a hint of chocolate. It also has a fruity quality, possibly melon, and lemon. I also got the impression of honey.  T - Lemon zest and grapefruit. Perfumy, with a bitter aftertaste.  M - Managed to pull of a light yet oily feel in the mouth.  D - This is a very interesting beer, there is a lot going on. It has complex flavours and aromas, and it's the sort of beer that could taste slightly different each time you drink it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DiabolikDUB,3.16,"On-Tap @ Bailey's Taproom poured into Shaker glass. Winter in July.  Pours a medium copper that is fairly clear with a dense, creamy off-white head that never fully dissolves and remains a thick layer atop the glass. The nose is biscuit malts, brown sugar, and some hints of hops. The flavor is a little watery upfront with some touches of sweet malt, toast and ends with a hop bitterness that lasts. Its medium bodied and has turned a little chewy. This beer is much better fresh as most of the hops that made this brew so special before have faded. It still drinks alright but is a little watery. I'll re-rate this again come December when its fresh.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Appearance: coppery-brown, hazy, thin layer of yellowy froth/suds, not much head retention, loose sediment  Aroma: malt caramel, sherry, very slight hops, brown sugar  Flavor: bready malt sweetness with overtones of rum raisin, dark brown sugar, and sherry; hop bitterness is still quite present as a raspy attack on the back of the tongue; finishes semi-sweet with a piney aftertaste  Mouthfeel: medium-full body, pert carbonation, alcohol warmth, and astringency on the teeth  Other comments: OK, this beer does not age well (at least not extended aging). It has become very unbalanced and a mere shadow of it's former self. Good experiment though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CHickman,4.87,"Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale 2008 pours dark amber in color with a nice fluffy 1 inch tan head; smells of hops, floral hops and spices.  Taste full of complex flavors that include floral hops, pine, malt, orange peel and a sweet caramel that fades to a cinnamon spice finish (with a touch of something else); medium carbonation that leaves a dry finish and gets better as it warms up.  I was lucky enough to get a case of this over the winter and a bargain price and enjoyed it all winter long. An outstanding beer!  2012 Release Notes: Pours hazy amber reddish with a huge foamy 2 finger head that faded slowly and left excellent sticky lacing. Nose is on par with the other years and full of delicious fresh piney hops, citrus and a blend of herbal earthy notes that is wonderful to inhale. Tastes of fresh piney hops, juicy citra hops, tart grapefruit, orange peel, lemon, herbs, caramel, roasted grains, malt, floral hops and mild spices; the balance is near perfect for an IPA with a fresh hop presence that is so bold that it’s almost warming for this time of year. Mouthfeel is smooth yet chewy, with a medium body, light to average fizzy carbonation and a bitter grainy aftertaste that trails off almost dry like hop leafs were left over. I look forward to this beer being released every year, my favorite holiday and winter beer and one of my top 5 favorite all time beers. The past few years I’ve been lucky enough to enjoy in on tap here in NY and it’s equally as enjoyable on draft.  2013 was great again, this time with stronger piney notes IMO. Had at least a case as well as a few pints on tap this year and it is always a great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,NorCalYeti,4.5,"taste- agressive malt and hops working together, lemony hop bitterness. this beer always delivers a bitter, caramel, malt finish...she's a tough one but in a good way. great cold weather beer.  color- beautiful rusted copper  clarity- fairly clear with suspended sediment  smell- grapefruit, sweet, soft perfume aroma  body- smooth, bittering hops are noticeable in the mid-palate but they are tame. medium-length finish.  appearance- great color, oily off-white head with sticky lace  overall impression- one of my all time favorite beers and one of the best in the world in my opinion.  notes and comments- tasting an '08 so this has about eight months in the bottle from the release date. the overall profile is mellower then when first released. i look forward to this beer every year as it ushers in the holiday season. if i had to pick a beer to accompany me on an island, i would have to throw it into the ring. i think two to four months in the bottle really elevates and integrates this beer well...you can't go wrong.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GilGarp,4,"Perhaps it's unfair to review a beer so far out of season but I'm going to do it anyway. I found a 12 pack for a deal and it was in the cooler so I figured it couldn't be that bad.  Pours from the stubby brown bottle into a pint glass. It has a nice warm copper color with good clarity and a thick crown of head. Some lacing is left behind but nothing spectacular.  Aroma is hoppy but not very hoppy. The sweetness is definately coming forward with a green apple and orange zest kind of way.  Flavor is still pretty hoppy but it's obvious that this beer would have been so much more in November. It has good balance and the hops working well, even contributing to the spicy nature of the beer. It's not the winter warmer but it's a nice warm spice IPA.  Mouthfeel is medium-plus body with good carbonation.  Overall it's a nice winter IPA and I'm looking forward to trying it fresh.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,haver,4.05,Just picked this up (5/21/09) on clearance for under $5.00 a six. It is out of date and I didn't car because I wanted to see if the flavor changed with age. Wow this Beer changed. The hop flavor went way down and the malt and spice went up. If you tried this beer a few months ago and see this on sale get it and see what I mean. I loved this when It came out and drank a lot of it. Before it was a rich IPA. This is now a different beer. The hops were hiding the malt and spices before and now they have come to play.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,vacax,4.15,"12 oz. bottle poured into pint glass. I've had this one fresh and saw it today and figured I would try it and am quite impressed with it. This being one of the few IPAs people age, I am interested to see how this holds up long term. Right now it is smelling incredible and drinking just as well.  A: Not quite amber, but an orange hued deep straw. Large off-white head has random sized beads that seems to have low to medium retention and some lacing.  S: Some of the most exotic fruits I have ever smelled in a non-fruit beer are coming out of this. It smells just like mangos and the essence of apricots. Slight resinous pine and maybe a hint of fruity yeast. My nose is seriously confused that the tropical fruits are this serious.  T: Begins fairly bitter with sharp and complex fruitiness. Apricots, mandarin oranges, lemon and grapefruit. Fruity, and increasingly spicy and bitterness follows along with resinous pine. Finish is lingering pine needles and apricots. An intense and complex beer that combines a rare intense fruit bouquet with its bitterness.  M: Medium body and a thick, pleasant, prickly carbonation.  D: Intense tropical fruits and high bitterness and a decently high ABV... it in a way is a sipper but its complexity has me taking drinks over and over trying to pint point its depth of flavors. A big beer that begs to be drank, I must say. This beer has me thinking about it more than most IPAs do, but in a very good way.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It has a nice very strong hoppy taste to it while being very refreshing at the same time. Goes with almost any type of meal or snack. Has a rich amber color to it with nice clarity to it as well, so the amount of flavor is a bit surprising. Very little bad to say about it, but if I had to be picky about it I don't find the aroma exceptionally strong, but still a nice hoppy smell to it. Very drinkable you could chug it if you want, but I would never recommend it, very much worth savoring this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It's gonna be lovely. Smells very citric. Bits of pine, some sweetness floating around in the nose as well. Quite impressive. Tastes yummy. Grapefruit, bits of grass, some strongly bitter green tea all floating in hop oil flavor. Sweetness is similar to subdued caramel. Very delicious, very nicely balanced. Great mouthfeel.

Actually more sessionable now. I pick up a bit of fruitness but after four swallows, can't quite pinpoint it. I picked up a bigger hop bite back in November when I had it on draft; I actually like it better now!

140,1904,wingman14,4.03,"Pours a dark hazy redish orange with a frothy white head that fades fast and leaves lacing. The smell is mostly hops with sweet notes, with some subtle spice notes. The smell could be subdued due to the cellaring (this is a 2008 release). The taste starts with a bite with some bitter hops followed by the spice and sweet notes, and finishes with the bitter hops again. The aftertaste is a long drawn out hop flavor. The mouthfeel is ok, the harsh bitter bite can turn some away, but the veteran hophead will fall in love. The flavor is deep, not very complex, but good.

After that it's all hops that will leave your mouth searching for a piece of cheese and a good oatmeal stout or wit to ""celebrate"". Or some toothpaste. Your choice.  Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale is a slightly spicy overly hopped adventure into a very bitter realm. For ""hop-heads"" only.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Martin2D,4.45,"A - Ruby red mixed with amber with a huge white head  S - Hops and Christmas spice  T - First hit with Christmas spices, then the hop bitterness follows. Extremely balanced in both sweetness and the hop bitterness.  M - Medium-heavy carbonation and medium in body  D - This one completely threw me off. IPA is kind of a stretch. Should be a ""Christmas IPA."" So different from any other IPA, this one deserves to be recognized as a great. Could drink this all night long.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ThaBobfather,4.08,Pours a classic hazy burnt orange color. Deep brown tinges. Thick white head. Smell of deep malt with some classic flowery hop smell on top. Complex of flavor with some light hops and citrus rind up front followed by some spice and sweet malt faintly. The finish is long and hoppy. Very sessionable.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,michaelgrant1983,3.11,"The color and head on the beer are both great. Decent smell on the ale, not what I expected though. The taste itself wasn't bad, just not impressive either. For all the noise about how great this beer was I was not impressed at all. It tasted like a stronger SN Pale Ale. That idea sounds like it would be a great brew, but something missed in this beer. Just flat didn't like it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,NatetheGreat,3.76,"This is just such a different beer for a winter ale. But when you need a hop fix in the dead of winter, I guess this is a lifesaver.  Absolutely huge head, beautiful ruby color glowing with orange and scarlet highlights. The aroma is hoppy, very fresh, with orange peel, fresh cut leaves and floral and spicy notes.  Taste is not very balanced, IMO, even hoppier than aroma. It's a hop explosion with very fresh leafy and flowery notes and some bitter citrus fruits - malt is there, not totally overwhelmed, but still overshadowed. Some sugery candy-like flavor. The feel is smooth and creamy and the drinkability could be better if not the alcohol were not so noticeable and the hops weren't so assertive. But, like I mentioned, if you're looking for a hop moment, here it is.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TheChauffeur1,3.92,I will skip the standards with this many reviews. This is a good looking beer with a spicy smell and great head. This beer is just plan awesome for the winter months. I always start off with this beer when we get into the Christmas ales. And what a great way to start a session. IMO this is what I did about a beer just damm well balanced and oh so good. You should really enjoy this one. Later,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

D) Mild malty / caramel sweetness in the nose and through. Bold bitterness and earthiness in the aftertaste. Full of hop love. M) Crisp and clean yet smooth and refreshing on the palate.

140,1904,rodney45,4.47,"This beer is a ruby red good looking beer. Head sticks around for a bit, and the beer is well carbonated. Centennial hops really permeate off this brew and i get a slight caramel hit too, with all voices screaming drink me. Hops are fantastically well balanced in this beer along with the winter spices( ie nutmeg & cinnamon), and the beautifully balanced malt. If anything dominated this brew it would be the sincere craft feel and the way in which it captures the essence of a true holiday IPA. If I had to drink a single beer for the rest of my days, this would be it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,adamette,2.79,"Served from a bottle into my Great Lakes Christmas Ale goblet. 2008 version.  A Generous 2 inch head sticks around for several minutes over a burnt orange but translucent body with visible sediment floating around. Actually a nice look!  S Hops bitterness dominates. I do not like this smell but it is appropriate to the style.  T Hops are too much, grapefruit bitterness that is so disagreeable to me. This bottle is a bit aged as compared with the version that I had on tap so I think that the hops are a bit more muted (thank God) but they are still very much there. This is a one note beer and a big disappointment.  M Full with hops bitterness. Appropriate to the style and boring.  D Not good. One and done for me.  Notes: I was curious to try this, rate it since it has about 4 months on it. I was hoping that a bit more of the malt came through but I was dissapointed.

Taste- clean and bitter, rich with viscosity citrusy almost lemony finish with lingering bitterness that just seems to coat the mouth and tongue Fabulous beer by SN. These guys have got this beer dialed right. It's an amazingly easy drinker despite it's 6+ % abv. Get some.

S: Citric hops with a nice orange-grapefruit character... some piney and floral hops also outline the subtle malt body.  T: Much like the nose, this has a prominent hop flavor... pine and orange-grapefruit... balanced without losing touch with what we all want in an IPA, the hops.  M: Smooth carbonation, medium body. Crisp finish.  D: An all around quality IPA that is a welcome treat during the winter months.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ritzkiss,3.8,"12oz 2008 bottle pours a slightly cloudy amber (much darker than an average IPA) - you can see some suspended particles. Leaves medium lacing.  Smell is piney. There are some lighter citrus notes and a hint of honey-sweetness malt, especially as it warms. Some grass too.  The first sip is all about the piney hops, bold and bright. In the back of the mouth we add some grapefruit and citrus hops. There is a slight hint of malty presence, though with the color and smell I thought maybe there would be more presence. Leaves a biting dry mouth and higher carbonation leaves some tingle in the mouth.  Really a solid example of an IPA. Hops dominated, tasty - though that being said, I wouldn't want to sip on it forever.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dismal,4.43,"Pours a really nice light copper, amberish color with a hint of orange. It produces a very nice head that sticks around for quite some time that leaves some very nice lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is very hoppy and piney. The taste is bitter in a very good way and right away you can tell it's pretty hoppy. The aroma, taste, and mouthfeel are all great in this beer. I could drink this all day easily. I love this beer, another great beer from a great brewery. It's to bad it's only seasonal, I guess it's good since I can look forward to it every year!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,grayburn,4.13,"What a great idea...in a seasonal market flooded with winter warmers and old ales, Sierra Nevada comes out with a good old ipa. Way to be original, just because it is winter does not mean tongue doesn't need hops! Pours a light orange with an off-white head composed of small bubbles that cling to the glass for dear life. Smells of piney hops, the pine dominates the scent and flavor profile. There is a decent malt backbone that the hops ride in on. The taste is the same, a pine front with a sweet finish, I am beginning to understand more why this is a winter seasonal. Like a lovely christmas tree in a glass. The mouth is smooth and creamy with perfectly played carbonation. This beer is very easy to drink, and the moderate abv means you can have a few.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,schroederm,4.07,"In a goblet:  Really great webby lacing and a decent head over an attractive dark amber hue. Head looks a bit sticky and holds on tight to the class. The nose involves common IPA aromas of lemon and grapefruit, with a bit of clove in there. The taste is quite floral with an extremely pleasant bitter aftertaste. The body is unfortunately thin, but is well carbonated. The brew is not overwhelming to the palate through its subtle use of fruit flavor and good level of bitter, making it both delicious and drinkable.  Overall: I reviewed this beer when it was at least 4 months old, but the argument has been made that this IPA holds up well to aging. This is definitely a beer to stock up on: great value for an exceptional IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Gosox8787,4.15,"Poured this beer from a bottle into a glass. The color is medium-brown with a slight white lacing, with little retention. The flowery smell of the hops is pleasant and not overpowering. A nice, hoppy flavor hits the palate up front. There is a slgiht bitter that lingers after each sip, but overall the flavor is great for an IPA. The mouthfeel was average, but nothing impressive. Only a slight hint of carbonation, but it works well enough for the beer. For an IPA from Sierra Nevada, I expected this beer to be less drinkable, but surprising, this does not overpower with flavor or alcohol content.  Overall, this was a really good to great IPA. One of the best winter seasonals out there. Worth a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,fightingirishcmk,3.98,"A: Poured a reddish amber color with a generous 3 finger beige head. The retention was fantastic, as was the amount of lacing left on the glass. S: Piney, citrus,hoppy, caramel malt, and brown sugar. T: Sweet with a very hoppy spicy finish. Pretty decent and tasty. M: A bit thin bodied, but a good amount of carbonation. D: Fairly drinkable, the hop taste is good. The price is pretty good too. Overall, a decent IPA at a decent price.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Vengeance526,4.03,"Pours a medium copper amber color with about a finger and a half of beige head that slowly subsides and leaves some nice lacing.  Lots of pine and citrus from the hops show up in the aroma.  Hops definitely come through in the taste with notes of grapefruit, pine and also some subtle caramel notes. Mostly hoppy with a very faint malt presence.  Medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. At first, I found this to be a little too bitter but I quickly warmed up to it. I would definitely drink these again but I probably wouldn't care to have too many in one sitting.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,twiggamortis420,4.38,"Pours a brilliantly clear light amber color with a huge reddish-tan head that slowly fades to a fluffy mesa surrounded by sheets of lace. A great looking beer.  Aroma is superbly fresh grassy hops and just enough honey-sweet caramel maltiness. Hints of clover, pears and Kix cereal.  Floral hop flavor profile while not going overboard on the bitterness. Smooth caramel and toasty maltiness provides just enough balance to keep it from being a hoppy mess. What I love about this beer is that there is no indications of oxidation or any other off flavors. A great beer and is quite possibly my favorite SN brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Jimbo87,4.15,"Nice clear copper color. Big off-white sudsy head.  Smell is awesome barley and hop balance. Citrus, maybe earthy?  Taste: I didn't get a very remarkable barley taste. As it warmed I could taste a slight toastedness. Hops are pretty much just bitterness. In accordance with the style, the balanced was tilted toward hoppy.  Mouthfeel is good. The head was very nice and creamy. And the beer has a substantial body for the style.  Pretty high drinkability. A very good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Anyway, here goes the review:  The beer pours a deep amber color with a slight haziness. There's a large beige foam that settles to a nice but uneven lid of foam after a couple of minutes in the glass.  Aroma holds lots of American hops, and some herbal-like notes that I can't really put my finger on, quite nice though.  Taste is nice and bitter with those herbal notes. There are also some hints of caramell and dried fruits.  A nice beer that I would love to try on-tap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,br3wmeister,3.56,"A- Big off white foamy head that is very sticky and leaves great lacing. The beer is a translucent copper color. Head dissipates to a thin cap that lasts almost to the bottom.  S- Nice light maltiness, hints of table sugar and earthy sweetness. Light hop character, nothing special going on in the nose here.  T- Lots floral and piney hops with some earthy herbal spiciness going on. Some malty balance but definitely not the focus here. Some caramel and hints of fruit, overtaken by piney hops and dry bitterness.  M- Medium bodied with lots of hoppy bite. Could use a little more malt to thicken it up a bit.  Overall- This is a decent beer but could use a bigger malt profile. Good display of hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Chapter40z,3.98,"A. Light amber color, completely translucent. Poured 2 solid fingers of off white head into a tumbler. Extremely appealing to the eye.  S. Some sweet citrus hops, Slight bitterness on the nose.  T. HOPS! and Christmas. All joking aside this is a great example of the American IPA. Definitely a hops-head beer but a solid beer all around.  M. Mid-full body on this on. Mild carbonation with a smooth lingering bitterness.  D. I'm not exactly a hops head and I still liked this beer. Strong representation of the style.

140,1904,kittylitter,4.72,"Nice head. Lovely smell of grapefruit and freshly mowed grass, and maybe a hint of blackcurrant! If you swirl it vigourously, you can feel a smell of pines, and juniper.

140,1904,BedetheVenerable,3.83,"Presentation: One of the more classic labels of the season; quite festive; this is the 2008 vintage; I bought it just a few days after release, I have no idea why I haven't gotten to this until now  Appearance: Beautiful bright burnt orange; tons of superfine sediment in suspension, I think I poured a bit overzealously...capped with a super fluffy whipped cream head that lasts and lasts and lasts...amazing sheets of lacing  Smell: No surprise here; fruity, zesty hops, hops, and hops! There's some spicy, bready malt character in the background, but this is all about the hops.  Taste: Bam! There it is. Big citrus hop bitterness right up front; this is big, sharp, and somewhat dry; the hops seem almost juicy though in the way they make your mouth pucker. Malt is somewhat balanced, but the hops are definitely this beer's raison d'etre.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, slightly puckering sharp finish  Drinkability: The hops are just slightly aggressive and the abv is a bit high to make me want more than a couple of these...but a couple, especially with a hearty steak and roasted fingerling potatoes, would be delicious  Conclusion: Classic West-Coast IPA...a little sharp, but overall quite pleasing...I make sure to pick this up every year",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The taste is very well balanced, with an excellent hop taste that recedes to a sweet, but not too sweet aftertaste, which is the best part IMO.  Mouthfeel is perfect. Carbonation levels could not have been more on par here, goes with the taste flawlessly.  As for drinkablity, it is damn good.

140,1904,maximum12,3.82,"So my wife & I have a date night a couple weeks ago & wander southward from the Twin Cities, randomly, no particular place in mind. We happen upon this nice place in Rosemount, MN, Rudy's Redeye Grill, & stop. You know the kind of place. Wine list longer than your arm, four beers. Fine. We're going to a place later where they have a great beer list (our house).  I ask what the ""seasonal"" is & she says ""Nevada"". I say, ""Sierra Nevada? What type?"" & she wrinkles her nose & repeats ""Nevada"". OK...guess I'll have one of those. NOTE: she was otherwise a superb waitress.  It comes. My wife sips & says ""Pale Ale"". I sip & say, ""No way. What is this?"" I wander up to the bar & if you haven't fallen asleep yet: a tap handle for Celebration. My first encounter. Much better beer than I expected with a very nice dinner.  So I needed to have one in a bottle to see if it's really good or just tainted by my euphoria of having a non-sucky beer that evening.  I have to say it was a little of both. This is a good, solid beer, with plenty of IPA flavor & some subtle spices to give it that wintery feeling.

If anyone is confused, this isnt a winter warmer, or spiced holiday beer either...its an IPA. Pours a nice clear amber colour with a substantial head. Nice sticky lace coats the glass as the beer is consumed. Smells like grapefruit juice, tastes like grapefruit juice and may as well be grapefruit juice. Gotta love those Cascade and Chinook hops.

Good head retention and tons of lacing.  S- Everything's really muted here. Hard to detect, but citrus hops are present, dominated by lemon. Really hard to get much out of the smell.  T- Beats the hell out of the smell. Hops are the first thing that hit me, with a grapefruit note in it. Pine notes are noticeable. Some malt shows up in the aftertaste. Almost no sweetness. Very sharp, bitter finish. As it warms, some bready and grainy malt notes are detectable.  M- The beer has enough malt to make it medium-bodied. There is very little carbonation.  D- Pretty easy to drink. I could take down a six-pack of this brew no problem.

It lasts throughout. Grapefruit in the nose along with other citrusy hoppy notes. It isn't a powerful smell, but pleasant. The taste is everything I look for in an American IPA. Citrus, orange, grapefruit, etc. You can taste the hops fully without them overpowering you with bitterness or dryness. Its great in the mouth and it wouldn't be a problem to drink many of these in a sitting.

140,1904,ricke,3.72,"Vintage 2008. Serving date: 2009-02-11. Served in pint glass.  Presentation: 350 ml bottle with freshness date on the label (best before 2009-10-17).  Appearance: Amber colored with copper and red hues, semi-clear. A rather aggressive pour into a pint glass creates a 3 finger airy head that has a strange, light cappuccino color (it actually looks dirty). Good head retention, some lacings.  Smell: A big hop fruity hop aroma, primarily of red and yellow grapefruits, lemon and surprisingly distinct strawberries - dominates. An earthy hop aroma of pine-needles is there as well. Behind all of this, is a faint note or reasonably sweet malts. A quite refreshing smell.  Taste: At first, some malt flavors appear, but they quickly leave room for a massive taste of hops. They mostly echoes the smell - grapefruits, sharp citric notes and strawberries - but the earthy notes of pine are bigger and accompanied by grass, mint and some tobacco. Although the malts are most noticeable in the beginning, they appear in the middle as well but they get constantly overrun by the hop flavors. The finish is semi-dry, a bit perfumy, contains sharp hops and has a seemingly endless bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, quite lively carbonation. It's kind of sharp, but the foam residues smooth things out.  Drinkability: I really liked this beer, but I think I was expecting a little more from it, especially considering its hyped status. Although I like its unbalanced character and big hop flavors (the strawberry presence, both in the smell and in the taste, is really great), the bitterness is a bit too to much and overpowers both the hop and malt flavors.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JohnQVegas,3.92,"Pours a ruby red-amber, with a one finger fluffy off-white cap that fades quickly into a thin layer around the edges. Nice lacing.  Nose is orange rind, clean, with a bit of resiny astringency underneath. Delicious.  Taste is caramel malt and bright citrus up front, a bit of resiny pine, with the finish bringing more of the resiny pine alongside a bit of a medicinal astringency. Long and bitter over the entire palate.  Full bodied and with an active but not overwhelming carbonation. A more robust malt backbone than often found in West Coast IPAs, this one is very nice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,webbcreative,2.5,"pours nice. The first thing I notice is the citrus, tates like grapefruit. then at the end it is so incredible bitter its hardly drinkable, to me, and its stays on the sides of my mouth and wont leave!

It does have nice carbonation though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T- The hop taste is good, not too over powering or palate killing. The apples and cinnamon taste is also there as well but just very faint.  M- Feels good in the mouth, not a palate killer in the least. The hop taste also doesn't linger for ages like some IPAs can.  D- Easy to drink to say the least.

I enjoyed the beer in a glass poured from a bottle.  A: Pours a rich golden brown color with a light tan 1"" head, which slowly disappears. Loose yet consistent lacing.  S: Beautiful, bright citrusy smell.  T: Equal balance of malt and citrus hops. Ends with a slight grapefruit type bitterness. Very pleasant.  M: Definitely not heavy. Medium to bold maybe.  D: Share a six with a friend and call it an evening. At 6.8, this one can fool you into drinking more than a few.  I couldn't wait until the holidays this year.

140,1904,AtlasBrew,5,"I got home after a shitty night at work and decided to do something nice for myself. So, I went to the fridge and got this lovely holiday brew. I was lucky enough to get a case on sale for $20, what a steal!  12 oz bottle and a 20oz wide mouth pub glass.  Color: It pours a rich copper color with a cream colored head that lasts a long amount of time.  Aroma: Lovely smell of fruity hops and a spicy hint of something I can't quite put my finger on but I like it.  Taste: A sweet and spicy beginning with a fruit and spice backend that leaves you floating in those wonderful hops. A bitter finish that gets stronger as it gets dryer. Medium mouth feel.  Overall: Love that spice and hop flavor, I'm not sure what they used here but it works, a very pleasant brew. My only wish is that they layed off the bittering hops just a tad, otherwise, it's a great brew.  Don't miss this one!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Lots of lacing left behind on the sides of the glass.  Aroma is citrusy, lots of grapefruit, some pine, spiciness, and a solid malt backing.  Taste is citrusy first, some pine in the middle and lots of spiciness in the finish. Malt backing is there throughout, and balances the hops nicely.  Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, very creamy texture.  I do think this is some really good stuff but I think people hype it up more than it is worth.

I got a good 1.5 inch head, super fluffy like a vanilla ice cream cone that dissipates quickly into a thin lacing that lasts to the end.  Smell: Bright, like a flower growing on the x-mas tree farm. Tingly on my nose hairs.  Taste: Smooth malts hit first, then the hop fruitiness, then the hop bitterness on the back of the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Cuts well, leaving a fresh coolness. The XL head is creamy.  Drinkability: 3 of 6 in one night, max.  I only tried this because it was on special, and now it's one of my favorites.

Smell is very pleasent floral hops and pine. Sensing a slight pepper of centenials but i can't be sure. Taste is wonderful blend of hops dominated by a peppery hop flavor but not overpoweringly so like many lesser ipas today. Rather, it's a well-crafted blend of bitterness.

There is a nice amount of bitterness that rounds this one out nicely.

Smell: Fragrant blanket of hops with scents of citrus, soap, and pine overlaying a rudimentary pale maltiness.  Taste: Pale malts with a clean, though transient malt sweetness. Big push by the hops, with flavors of rosin, lemon-scented soap, and grapefruit pith. Moderate bitterness throughout. Oh, but the humble malts fight valiantly to regain some ground, but, sorry, it's game, set, match for the hop bitterness. Slight grassiness. Long, lingering bitterness on the dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Very light stickiness to the mouthfeel.  Drinkability: A Celebration of brash, simplistic bitterness which, if that's your bag, is fine, but I never ever quite understood all the hoopla for this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Troyone,4.25,"Surprised I have not reviewed this beer, it's been in my change up for a long time.  Appears to be an light amber color, close to copper, with an off white muti-colored head. The yeast is suspended and causes a hazy appearance. Lacing has already developed before I started to consume.  The citrus hop aroma overrides the maltly smells. I'm getting some pine and other esters with a malt background. I'm using a 16 oz Pilsner glass because I think the narrow portion, from bottom, will concentrate the carbonation so I can get all the aromas at the wide top.  I'm getting the grapefruit hops right from the first gulp. Hints of pine and a background of malt, well balanced. The caramel malt is toasty and blended well with the hop bitterness. There is also a hint of coffee.  A medium bodied beer that is smooth and fills the mouth with esters and a background of malt with hints of caramel. The finish is dry and lingers a crisp grapefruit aftertaste with a hint of coffee.  At 6.8 abv this is very drinkable only the grapefruit finish with hints of coffee may slow down the session.  This has been in my change up for a while usually in the winter months. Although this is close to being a winter type of IPA there is just not enough abv for such therefore enjoy this year around.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

That has gone down to a steady 1/4"" head even after about 15 minutes and some lacing is there as well.  A very in your face nose of slightly sweet malt and tons of hops (piney esthers mostly). There is almost a dread dough aspect there as well.  Love the taste! A lot of bitterness on the front end. That tapers off into a balance of nice toasty malt flavors and still tons of hops that are assertive, but not over the top!  A nice mouthfeel as well. Nice carbonation that lasts even as the finish sails on.  The ABV is not bad, so while not a session beer, I could have several. I look forward to this beer every year!

Aroma hits you right in the face - pine, grapefruit, citrus, fresh hops. Floral. A hint of sweet malts as well. Very strong smelling, nice.  Taste starts off with a wave of citrus (orange) hops, evens with a good caramel malt backbone, then finishes extremely bitter. Outstanding. Grassy, piney, loaded with grapefruit.  Medium bodied, great mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot on. Very smooth with a touch of creaminess. Drank extremely easy despite the massive presence of hops - the only problem is you can drink them way too fast, despite the ABV. This is a great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste was really good with a nice balanced hop flavor with a subtle malt balance. THe beer is medium bodied and has adequate carbonation. This is one smooth beer and for someone that isn't huge on hop overload this was a really enjoyable beer. I'm hoping I can still scrounge a sixer or more if it's still available.

Taste is an overload of pine, almost like drinking directly from a pine tree. There are no surprises here - the aroma permeates your nose all the while you simultaneously taste the same thing. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. Drinking ability is great here and I don't really have anything to complain about. ABV is a little on the high end for an ipa which decreases its session-ability. This is a pretty straight forward but great example of the style.

In all seriousness the smell was of floral hops and grapefruit.  Taste- Bitter, peppery and sweet grapefruit. Some malty background fade in and out give this beer a good balance. Almost a minty pine needle flavor as well pretty freaking good.  Mouthful- flavor lingers beer has a great bite to it. if your a hop head you'll love this beer.

Leaves a thick lacing as it goes down the glass.  Smell is a blast of citrusy hops, maybe some caramel and pale malt. Smells delicious!  Taste is off the charts hoppiness/happiness! It comes at you with an orangy hop flavour up front, and then shifts to a puckery but pleasant bitterness at the end. A taste experience.  Mouthfeel is perfect. It glides over the tongue with ease, while still letting you know it's there.  Drinkability is great.

M - Moderate body with nice warm finish.  D - Great beer, but the heaviness and ABV would keep me from drinking alot. But, with holiday beers drinking a lot is not really the point.

Piney, grassy, and citrus. The hop flavor is best described as juicy in this one. Nice lingering bitterness.  M - Medium bodied and smooth.  D - Rock solid drinkability.

This is an IPA to search out.  I bought the last two cases at my local good beer store. Two days prior there were like 20 cases on the floor and I figured they would stick around.

140,1904,kkipple,4.08,"After 1,700 reviews, what's left to say?  Celebration is a delicious, well crafted beer. The 2008 version is crackling: a fine over-hopped amber brew that looks great, smells great and is rather dangerous on top of all that. Wonderful head and lace, fine retention, flavorful blend of sweet malt and juicy, oily hops. Mouthfeel is full, creamy and bittersweet in all the right ways. It's hard to find fault with, really.

Decent lacing. Hops really stood out in the smell. And yes, after the first sip, the hops hit me. Now, maybe it's my fault, but this is not what I expected. I thought this beer was more along the lines of a winter ale, with the very festive label and all. Not being a huge hophead, I was looking for something a bit more smooth to drink.

Flavor is rich with malt and clean hops in the mouth's back. It drinks warm with the malts stronger early but finishes with overwhelming (in a good sense) hoppiness.  In a side note, my father saved some 2007. The family beer drinkers tasted them blind side by side. Almost all of us preferred the 2008. After a year 2007 is still a good beer, just not as ""bright"" as 2008... and 2007 carried an additional flavor characteristic... something similar to the hoppiness of Fuller's ESB.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ThirdLap,4.03,"'08 Celebration, $13.80/12pk from the local discount supermarket.  Pours a very dark amber leaving a creamy white ~1cm head. Head retention is relatively low, lasting a few minutes at best.  Screams cascade and centennial hops... they really jump at you here. Very citrusy and spicy nose.  I suspect that the character of this beer is very susceptible to poor storage and aging, as this one seems to be a bit more fresh and crisp ('bright' comes to mind) than previous tastings. The hops are extremely well balanced by the present but unobtrusive malty backbone.  I love the big carbonation bite of Celebration. I've found that like hops and malt, carbonation is an integral part of the balance of a good beer. The finish is just dry and clean, leaving just enough bitterness on the tongue.  Drinkability is quite high. I'm already craving another.  If SNPA is a great 'gateway' beer and Double Bastard is a great extreme beer, this is probably one of the best 'transitional' beers I've come across. A great introduction to what lies ahead for an unbeatable price.

The head was larger at about 1.5"". Lacing was impressive.  Smelled great! Nice hop smell and a touch of sweet from the malt.  Hops! Oh, I definitely tasted the hops but it came across very balanced and made me follow my 1st sip with a nice gulp. Excellent medium-strong hop balance.  I'm buy this again... and again.

A heavenly perfume (this coming from a cologne reviewer!) of scent, tinges of orange, pine and cedar, and exotic spice on a bed of luscious malt. Absolutely wonderful. I wonder how this would do in an atomizer. Eau de Celebration, anyone?  T - Sold. One sip was all it took. Big and spicy opening, this is what a winter warmer should do for you. The malt and hops are in a good balance, keeping smooth until the end when it finishes with a nice hoppy kick.  M - This is a full-bodied ale, make no mistake. The finish is clean and definitely on the bitter side. That bitterness persists for a good while, a couple minutes if you can manage to set this beer down that long. You're not exactly going to be able to down this like water, but given how rich the beer is it goes down very smooth. Very sippable. Alcohol is completely masked, which is scary considering the slightly above-average ABV and how good this is.  D - Seems like a great session beer with fellow beerophiles. Seems like a near-perfect warming brew after being out in the snow and cold.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste: One-ups the smell by taking the spicy/malty/fruity/hoppy to the extreme, leaving you wanting more.  Mouthfeel: Dense but yet smooth on the palate, leaves a dry, thirsty feeling afterward.  Drinkability: Just one is clearly not enough and at 6-7%, dangerous.

140,1904,dudecandle,4.09,"As soon as I opened the bottle, I was smacked with a heavy hoppy smell, easily reminded me it's an IPA I'm dealing with. A: It poured out clear, copper color into a 12oz pilsner glass, nice thick off-white one-finger head which dissipated low pretty quickly, but still stayed at least a bit while leaving a nice lacing all along the glass. S: An amazing combination of hops, pine, citrus, maybe some grape. T: Interesting, with the token IPA hoppiness being the most notable aspect of it all. The fruit plays a part as well, rounding it out pretty well. Higher level of alcohol is unnoticed, a big plus. M: Almost offensive, moderately thick, nice low level of carbonation, and it never seems to leave. D: Daunting at first, especially for me, not a huge fan of IPAs, but I have to respect this beer. The dynamic flavor-smell combinations are remarkable, and though it's not my favorite, the never-departing flavor may be the reminder that it is something to be reckoned with.

The bite was immediate and sharp, but otherwise very clean and not overpowering. It lingered on the palate long enough that I wouldn't be inclined to drink it very fast, as you get more mileage out of it savoring it between sips.  I will definitely try this again when it is next in season next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JonathanL7890,4.52,"Had on tap at the Dig Pub. Poured into a pint glass with about 1 finger head that dissipated slowly. Color is a rich amber, very clear. Aroma: citrus (grapefruit), piney, some caramel malt, a little biscuity. Taste: The sublime hop presence of this beer is announced! A perfect balance of malty sweetness and back of the tongue bitterness. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel of this beer is remarkable. a ""Comfort beer"". Drinkability: This is my go to beer for the winter months. But, alas, Bigfoot and Torpedo Extra IPA will soon be out and I'll have to find something else to session. I'll be looking forward to next year's batch.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,hoppheadIPA,4.15,Pours out of the bottle a deep hazy copper color with an pillowy white head that sticks to the glass producing some excellent lacing as I drink. Smells of citrus hops. A very clean crisp scent that matches the flavor of clean hops with some malt in the backround. A bit thicker than most IPAs but all in all an excellent beer. Drinkability is good. I could have a few of these. Yum,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CMW,4.45,"The beer pours a deep copper color which turns more orange when held up to the light. There is a good amount of carbonation present which adds to the brew being mostly opaque. There is a nice white two finger head that left lacing throughout the entire glass.  It comes as no surprise that the aroma is dominated by hops, hops, and more hops. The sweet malt is also present along with some citrus fruit. I am picking up grapefruit or some sour lemon.  The first thing I noticed was the sour citrus fruit. However, this was immediately overpowered by a blast of hops. There is a hint of malt but it is dominated by the hop flavor. I can catch a bit of spice toward the end, but very little. The beer finishes dry, very clean and simply refreshing. The aftertaste brings back a tad of the citrus fruits mixed with the somewhat bitter taste you come to expect from the style. Even at 6.8% abv. the alcohol is barely noticeable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dukedevil0,4.27,"One of my last bottles from a 12 pack from Jungle Jim's in Fairfield, OH.  A: Pours amber colored with a white head....good lacing on the glass  S: Smells hoppy, fruity, citrusy  T: Tastes similar to the smell with some hop bitterness at the end with a crisp, refreshing finish...i have notice this tastes WAY more bitter when drinking while eating  M: thick for an IPA with above average carbonation  D: Highly drinkable, it's refreshing and solid flavor without tasting alcohol makes this a great session beer",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,melagnus,4.25,"A - Pours an amber color with great head retention. Lacing forms as the head recedes! Foam looks very frothy and thick. The beer itself looks clear with mild carbonation.  S - Instant hoppy aroma consumes the senses. Citrus and some spicy node follows suit.  T - Malts surround the palate, though bitterness ensues fairly quickly afterward with a lasting tingly feeling on the palate.  M - Almost creamy taste rushes over the tongue at first and thereafter numbs the sensation with hops. Though not spiced, some sort of spice comes across the palate, so possibly a specific type of hops or malt.  Conclusion - Great beer, very drinkable. Seems to taste better at cooler temps than when warmer. As always, great quality from an amazing brewery!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,fosterific,3.53,"This beer looks great poured into a glass. It has a translucent golden-amber color with a solid custard colored head.  The glass explodes with the dominating crisp aroma of hops, lot and lots of hops.  As the smell foreshadowed, my palate is submerged in the bitterness and teasing of hops that encourages just one more sip before I set the glass down.  The carbonation level gives the beer a light, crisp mouth feel.  I always enjoy a well hopped beer such as this and am curious as to how this AIPA will age. With any hoppy beer though, I can only handle so many before needing a break of malty goodness.  -peace",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S- citrus fruits and malty. a hint of hops, so they are still there, but they have definitely degraded over a year.  T- orange up front with some malts and a sweetness that i cant quite place. the hops are only noticeable in the finish when it leaves you with a lingering bitterness.  M- Medium bodied and smooth.  D- i could (and have) drink celebration all night. it goes down easy and begs you to have another.  overall i would say that i like them fresh more than aged. that being said, this is the third aged one i've had and ive found them all to be very good. with a year on it, it tastes more like a hopped up APA than an AIPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,aggiearcher13,4.43,"Every winter I look forward to this beer, and now that I'm drinking my last one while listening to the hockey game I suppose I should review one. Of course I'll have another couple weeks of finishing off the stray bottle that the local bars have leftover...  A: I've always enjoyed the color of this beer. It's dark for your average IPA, maybe flirting with an amber a little. Pours with about a half inch of head on it.  S: I can really smell the cascades in this one, a very enjoyable wave of pine and citrus.  T: Kind of like winning the Stanly Cup, it never gets old. Hops hops and hops, with a little bit of malt too it.  M: If there is one problem with the mouthfeel, it's a little overcarbonated for my taste.  D: As I lie in bed each morning and ask myself why I should put both my feet on the floor there are precious few reasons I've been able to come up with. The chance to escape my girlfriend's morning breath, sure. Celebration Ale?

140,1904,Willamette,4.21,"2008 - 12oz - 45~50 deg. - nonic  This was among the ugliest beers I've drank (or is it drunk?). It had head, color and lacing so it wasn't all bad, but the iced-tea amber color with suspended grit and roaming chunks made it look really home-style. It's a good thing 'looks aren't everything', the aroma and taste easily make up for the appearance. Hops forward, followed closely by caramel and then malt. Tastes very much like it smells but has a strong, enjoyable bitter edge. It's getting prettier... It's been a while since I've had Celebration and I don't remember it being this good. I want to say that this could be THE standard for an American IPA. Not too much west coast hoppyness (barely), and a clear caramel /malty core that I associate with eastern styles (as if I actually had a clue). Others here have described it far better than I can but this is well worth drinking and should be sought out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,IronCitySteve,4.33,"Not having any more Wet Hop Harvest, I switched to the Celebration Ale.  A: A really deep dark amber color with a very nice and distinct off white head. Lots of lacing that is long lasting.  S: Mainly a hoppy scent of pine, citrus and other fruit. Some spice and malt undertones.  T: At first the beer tasty a little malty, but soon thereafter, the hops hit you. Not overly balanced, but very distinct flavors.  M: A little slick, left the mouth feeling a tad oily.  D: A very nice IPA, worthy of multiple in one sitting.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Pours a very nice clear see-through amber. Huge foamy thick tan head that leaves abundant lacing. This one was an over pour.  Aroma is of piney hops and spice. There's also some fruity sweetness in there.  Taste is entirely hops. Slick, oily, piney hops. The malt is present enough to provide some balance and keep this from being ultra-bitter. Nice dry finish, with a little spicy aftertaste.  This is a beer that definitely leaves you wanting more. It clings to your tongue just enough to remind you that there's still some left in the glass and whispers gently for you to drink it. And then another. And then another.  This beer is definitely worth Celebrating.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Great retention and lots of sticky, foamy, spidery lace. Great.  Smell: Grapefruit hops blend with equally strong pine hops. An underlying malt base brings some balance to the brew.  Taste: Rich, malty base gives way to grapefruit and pine. Slightly floral with rose and hyacinth. Turns into a smooth winter ale as the bitterness diminishes.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, bitter, sweet and versatile. This could be one of the best winter type ales out there. Mild alcohol warmth. Medium body.  Drinkability: As usual, Sierra Nevada doesn't disappoint. Plenty of American style bitterness. A true classic of a winter release. Solid beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tbeck,4.2,"Pours a dark amber and a slight clarity. Retains a two finger off-white head that slowly moves to a nice collar and excellent laciness. Fresh aroma with some spice, but mainly piney. Good smell. Taste is mellow and balanced with pine and a slight malt taste. There is a slight bitterness, but smooths out. Texture is viscous but not heavy bodied. Good drinking beer, very enjoyable. A bit on the sweet side so only a couple at a time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,davexisxrabid,2.85,"This ale poured a nice clear amber color. You could see faint carbonation climbing its way to the thick and foamy 3/4"" head.  Nice aroma of biscuit dough, citrus, pine and grapefruit.  Semi-sweet taste at first immediately followed by a sharp bitter hop taste and a rather unpleasant metallic taste.  The very bitter unbalanced flavors seemed to stick to my palate, which didn't bode well for its mouthfeel or drinkability. The bitter metallic aftertaste sticks around on your palate and detracts from what should be an enjoyable experience.  Not very drinkable in my opinion - it was a bit too hoppy for my taste, even for an IPA and the aftertaste did not make the experience any better. I know a lot of people enjoy Sierra Nevada stuff, but just about everything I've tried has been disappointing and unfortunately I had higher hopes for this ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: Big grapefruit flavor with a nice hop presence. Leaves a nice oiliness from the hops in your mouth.  M: Nice hoppiness going on with a medium body. Again leaves a nice oiliness in your mouth.

The smell was not overwhelming hop, actually smelled more malt here.  Ah...here's the IPA! Much more of a hop taste then I smelt. Not too overwhelming and there is a good bit of malt here. I like the ""balance"" for an IPA. Medium mouthfeel here, with moderate carbonation.

S - Smell of a good hoppy beer. Chinook hops are noticeable with a smoky, strong yet pleasant smell with a light floral character.  T - Can taste the use of the various hops typical of a good IPA. IPA's are one of favorite styles. I love the bitter but not overwhelming flavor that leaves an aftertaste that lasts for minutes after. Even though slightly strong you can't taste the alcohol.  M - It has a great feel in the mouth. I like how it coats your mouth for an IPA leaving you wanting more.  D - Extremely drinkable and excellent example of an american IPA. One of those you can sit down and drink several wanting more.  A great example of an american ale that is worth spending the extra dollars for. It is always a staple for me during the holiday season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Just as clear, less fizzy, and more red (almost pinish, even)--for me those are all positives. Less hops and more malt both in the smell and in the taste. This is a very nice beer--somewhere between a red and a pa/ipa--and that suits me just fine. It's not as big as many seasonal releases; I expected it to be a slightly bigger beer, closer in that regard to Bigfoot. But there is nothing to complain about and plenty to enjoy.

M - The bitterness REALLY hangs on, but the overall feel is smooth and easy drinking without being too watery.  D - Not being a huge fan of IPA's, I'm not sure how many of these I could stomach. One is a-ok for me.  Overall, It's not a favorite, but I'd definitely drink it again. It's bitter, but what self-respecting IPA isn't?

There is some chunky lacing but not a lot.  Smell: I mostly smell the citrus aspect of the hops, some spiciness but only a hint. Small amount of malt on the nose. The smell overall is not very strong.  Taste: Hoppy bitterness, good citrusy hops. I taste a bit of some spicy flavors. All followed by a nice malt backbone. There is a harsh bitterness left in the mouth after drinking this beer.  Mouthfeel: medium-light bodied, nothing too special, good amount of carbonation.

The nose has lots of bright grapefruit scents. Delicious, inviting, and again, bright!  The taste is delicious. Tons of hops. Mostly citrusy and floral, with some pine. A bit of spiciness as well.

140,1904,mjw06,4.15,"This is a review of the 2008 edition.  A - Cherry amber color with a rich tan head about two fingers high that last well and leaves a thick sticky lacing.  S - Sweet smell of spices, particularly clove and a little cinnamon, as well as a toasty caramel base and underpresence. does also carry a citrus scent most akin to grapefruit.  T - Sweet taste that doesnt completely match the smell. spices are not dominant, and are actually somewhat hidden in the taste, however the grapefruit smell is confirmed in its taste and lends to the bitterness in the hoppy finish. Impressed with the taste, but am again distracted by the hoppy finish.  M - Once again an excellent mouthfeel from a sierra nevada brew. perfect light carbonation that doesn't distract and a somewhat creamy mouthfeel.  D - This beer is without a doubt a very drinkable beer. however i would appreciate maybe a toning down on the hops in this brew so that i may appreciate its complexity of flavors. or maybe its not even the hops, but rather this continued grapefruit taste that im getting. never was much a fan of grapefruit. nonetheless i think ive found a winter brew that i can stick with, however it still dissapoints in some areas.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste: A malty ale that also has a hoppy bitterness. Minimal floral hops taste. Very sweet, but a weird aftertaste that seems to linger forever.  Mouthfeel: Seems thin-bodied and not very carbonated.

140,1904,bbothen,4.4,"Wow. 1,700+ reviews for this beer. We probably could use another opinion. Here's mine.  This is about the 37th bottle I've had of this since it started showing up in stores this year. No lie.  Pours a red dark amber color with a thick & bubbly 2+ finger deep head. Lots of sticky lacing left on glass.  Smells of earthy, grassy, piney, sprucy, citrusy hops. Along with plenty of caramel and grain.  Sweet caramel maltiness makes an appearance before the bitterness arrives and takes over, pine, grapefruit, spruce, grass, balancing maltiness squeezes back in, caramel, toffee, hoppy bitter finish wins the battle. Seeriously, this is a tasty brew.  Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, dry lingering hoppiness.  Could drink these all day. Year round. My definition of a session brew.  A delicious IPA. Wish this was available year round. An unbelievable bargain as well. Around the holidays 12 packs were going for $12.99 in Safeway supermarkets. Awesome.

140,1904,Phillyduke,4.18,"2008 release served from a 12 oz. NR into an Imperial Pint glass.  A: Beer is clear with a beautiful red hue and a rocky 2-3 finger head with phenomenal retention that leaves trails of sticky lacing as it slowly recedes. Resins are visible in suspension upon close inspection, and the lace continues to cling as I drink the beer down.  S: SN's characteristic hop profile, but cranked up an extra few notches. Piney, grassy, and a touch floral with a twinge of alcohol. Not much malt sweetness to be found here, but what do you expect with the two C's (Cascade and Centennial) dominating the nose?  T: Surprisingly enough, this isn't the hop assault on the palate that I was anticipating. Sure, the dry, crisp, bitter hoppiness is there (boy is it ever!), but a pleasing caramel maltiness is also making a case for itself. The combination makes for an incredibly balanced IPA that never goes overboard in either direction, but still manages to hit you with a seemingly immense dose of hops without crushing you in the process. The alcohol I detected in the nose is barely noticeable here.  M: Smooth and clean, with a crisp, tongue-tingling carbonation. Finish is short, dry and bitter, and almost completely dominated by the hops.  D/O: Yeah, this one's all about the hops, and I for one am appreciative! The balance brought on by the rich caramel malts prevent this beer from becoming an over-the-top tongue bruiser, while still preserving the incredible raw hoppiness of it all. Extremely enjoyable, and quite drinkable, both from an ABV and palate-fatiguing standpoint. A refreshing change of pace among the other malty, rich, spiced winter seasonals. I've saved a few of these to cellar and see how things go in 6 months to a year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Not something I would fight over in the summer time, but an awesome winter brew. I am a huge fan of both IPA's and seasonal brews so this combination was great.

Perfectly executed, as to be expected from Sierra Nevada. These guys know to use hops. I know my descriptions aren't overly detailed, and don't do it justice, but this beer is so well done.

Great retention and left globs of lacing as it sank down to form a halo that surrounded an island of foam.  A: Sweet bready, caramel malts, grapefruit and piney hops, honey, yeast, and some spices. Smells like christmas trees!  T: Starts with some good initial hop flavors that follow the nose, accompanied by sweet bread and caramel malts. This is followed by a great addition of spices and flavors including; a little cinnamon, (nutmeg?), honey, ginger, and what tastes like pine needles. As they become more pronounced, they really play off of the base of the grist quite nicely. Finish is adequately dry and features some prominent yeast and a citrusy twang that adds yet another layer of flavor, and another increase on the enjoyment meter. Very pleasant aftertaste lingers for quite awhile. Damn tasty!  M: Medium-full body, mouth-coating, smooth, crisp and sharp, and gently carbonated.  D: Through the roof. Incredibly easy to drink due to the great christmasy flavors that keep you coming back for more.  Notes: What a perfect beer to enjoy with my dad as we watch USC beat the living daylights out of the Nittany Lions on New Year's Day. This is the definition of a festive beer that is best enjoyed on such special occasions, as it reminds you why this time of the year is so magical. The best session beer on the planet when the holiday season rolls around!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ColForbinBC,4.18,"12oz bottle poured into a pint  Pours a deep red amber with a huge, fluffy light tan colored cap. The thick cap takes a while to subside and leaves huge gobs of sticky lace all over the glass. Awesome.  Hops jump right out of the glass and assault your olfactories. Huge grapefruit, pine, and spruce layered atop a toasted, sweet grain.  Taste is of grapefruits, orange peel, pine needles and a toasted grain. Sweet up front, then the bittering hops take over. A pretty classic ipa flavor in the west coast style.  This guy is big and chewy, yet soft and creamy. It leaves a hop oil slick coating the mouth. Full bodied, carbonation is at just the right amount to lead to the chewy, yet creamy mouthfeel.  The abv is on the north side of 6, but this is pretty well-crafted and as a hophead, I could drink this all night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ljbrisson,4.6,"Poured a dark amber color into my Duvel glass with a rocky, soapy, two-finger off-white head which left prodigious lacing all over the inside of the glass. Aroma is fruity hops with a bit of malt, candy (red Jolly Ranchers), flowers. Mouthfeel is full yet not heavy, smooth, great carbonation. Taste is orange and caramel up front, with some nuttiness and toffee flavor towards the middle and a perfect hop bite toward the finish. At first I was skeptical of the hype surrounding this brew, but after tasting it I can honestly say that this is by far the best IPA I have tried and has greatly deepened my appreciation for hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GWaters,4.2,"I bought a sixer of this ale because historically I have been a holiday/winter beer snob. This winter, I have decided to delve deeper into the realm of winter beers.  Although I love beers with hops, and truly enjoyed this ale, I do not know why this beer has been labeled with a winter theme. The hops and grapefruit are front and center on this beer. There is no real presence of holiday spice or winter flavors. So, why exactly they call this a celebration ale, I am not certain. I do recommend this ale though. I find it to be affordable and very drinkable, if you like hops. Heck, I would even compare this to an Arrogant Bastard Ale at a much lower cost.  Pour: The pour was a gentle amber/orange with a two to three finger head that slowly dissipated and left a nice lace on the glass throughout the drink.  Smell: The smell was grapefruit/citrus right up front with a nice hop spice mixed in.  Taste: The drink starts with a hop kick up front and goes quickly sweet with a fruit tone. The finish is nice hops that linger, but not too long. The hops are there but not oily, just a nice hop flavor.  Drinkability: This is a good example of an IPA. Good for a person that is new to IPA's and great for a seasoned beer drinker. Great flavor, great look, very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Packforever1976,4.3,"Poured chilled into a british pint. 2008 vintage  A: Pours a medium-dark amber with nice clarity. Fluffy 2-finger off-white head. Decent retention. Nice lacing.  S: Nice blend of floral/citrus/pine hops. Some sweet malts as well. Very nice.  T: I get some malts right away, but the hops come roaring in immediately. Nice sweet biscuity malts, followed by some bitter pine/citrus hops. Finishes very bitter. Delicious.  M: Nice level of thickness. Feels very creamy in my mouth. Carbonation level is just a tad high, but still good. Balanced.  D: Drinkability is very good. This packs some punch with the flavor, but is still very sessionable. I was able to score another half-case of this, which I plan to cellar. I plan on revisiting this same vintage when the '09 comes out. Tasty stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RunDWP,3.51,"Sorry, I just find myself a raving fan of this brew. It looks great, with a big flaffy light tan head floating on the bronz brew, but I found it went down hill from there. It's hoppy, with an earthy, resiny bitterness that just wasn't to my liking, and which I think clashed somewhat with the nutty and slightly caramel malt. Lot's of hops on the nose, this one is pretty aromatic. It's good, but I didn't find to as great as many people here found it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dasenebler,4.33,"Beautiful appearance, rich copper color with a creamy off-white head. Citrusy and piney hop aromas, tanginess as well.  Pretty damn hoppy and bitter, with a great biscuity and caramel malt structure. Great hop flavor, I get a lot of grapefruit. A malty IPA as well. Bitter, toasty aftertaste. Delicious overall, too bad it's a seasonal. Ideal carbonation (not too much) and balanced, somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Overall impression is that this is a fantastic IPA and one of a kind winter seasonal.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,felipe2toes,3.85,"Color was an orange-copper hue with a nice creamy head. The lacing was nice on this beer as well, clinging to my glass till the last drop.  The nose was very piney, not much citrus that I could detect. The taste was piney as well, the hops really come through. The carbonation was nice on the tongue too. I liked this beer very much, though I'd say the drinkability is OK as the hoppiness got to my palate pretty quickly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,evanackerman,4.6,"Beer pours a deep orange copper color with a creamy substantial head that leaves beautiful wispy lacing as the beer is consumed.  Aroma is pine, citrus, caramel, lovely!  taste is a truly exceptional balance of citrus and floral hops with a solid backbone of caramel malt. outstanding!  mouthfeel is medium bodied, very nice for style. no complaints. carbonation is just right.  overall, I have to say this brewery sure knows how to do pales and IPAs, absolutely outstanding American IPA here, very enjoyable, worth seeking out or making a special trip to acquire. the only thing keeping this beer from a perfect score is that the Sierra Nevada Hop Harvest Ale is even better!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BBThunderbolt,3.48,"Poured into a straight pint glass. Pours a lovely dark copper color. Poured a small, tight head that disappated quickly. Leaves a nicer lacing than the head would lead you to believe. A sharp hop aroma. Tastes matches aroma. Basic, solid hop flavors. Little to no floral flavors, all sharp flavors. Lacks body and backbone, but is in line with most American IPAs. Nicely drinkable, I suffer palate fatigue after 2-3 so not really that sessionable. A solid IPA, and I generally have some around when available, but this beer does not run away from others of this style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kels,4.6,"Had a bottle to ring in the new year! Poured into a pint glass as the ball dropped.  Appearance: Gorgeous plummy amber with good carbonation running throughout and a 1-finger tan head that shrinks to a skim quickly. Good lacing remains throughout.  Smell: Great citrusy hop smell, big on grapefruit and pine, combines really well with a warm, toasty grain tone.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The hops present very directly in this beer - there is strong citrus rind presence with a great balance from toasty, almost crunchy tasting grainy maltiness. The alcohol comes through, but isn't too strong. The mouthfeel is light and bright thanks to the good level of carbonation.  Drinkability: I could drink this all night. Nuf Said.  I have to mention that I've had plenty of these before, but I just got around to reviewing it because I enjoy it so much that I've never wanted to sit down and actually think on it enough to write it. I figured since my stock for the year is almost gone, I better get to it!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BrewerB,4.04,"A - Clear, light copper, with a 1-finger pillowy, off-white head that is holding up well. Nice lacing left on glass as I drink.  S - Citrusy hops, cracker-like maltiness, sprinkled with a piney-type scent.  T - Firmly bittered, rich and malty. Lots of crackery malt flavor, grassy/citrusy hop charcaters. Finishing dry with a lingering bitterness and hints of resiney/piney hops.  M - Medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Smooth.  D - The kind of brew I can easily drink a sixer of. Well-balanced, pleasing dry finish. Plenty of hop kick and bitterness lies atop a densely-crafted backbone of malts.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Bagman007,3.95,"Served in a bottle poured into a pint glass.  A- Brown copper coloring with more than a finger's width of head.  S- Has a hoppy scent. Kind of sweet. Has a light hint of malts as well.  T- Great balance of hops and malts. A few spices also give this beer a kick.  M- Excellent carbonation. Not too bitter, but it does have a little bit of a bite at the end.  D- Hoppy, but still fairly drinkable. You should be able to have a few of these in a sitting.  Overall one of the best Winter Warmer's around. A must have around this time of year. Highly recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jpaltan,4.23,Wow. Really impressed by it's appearance. Nice thick and foamy with tons of lacing on the sides of the glass. Coppery orange color. Smell is wonderfully hoppy. Notes of grapefruit and other citrus smells. Not much in the way of piney fragrances. Taste is really nice as well. Grapefruit bitterness is well balanced by a malty sweetness. Quite smooth and very drinkable.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bataround,4.65,"Appearance: Beautiful orange/copper with a nice, off-white head that sticks pretty well.  Smell: Aroma of cascade hops: grapefruit, pine, and a slight floral note. Great nose on this beer!  Taste: Has a good malt background, but this brew's all about the hops! Despite this, there's still of good balance of flavor. This is beer with cascade hops done right. Does a great job of arousing the appetite.  Mouthfeel: Pretty good for the style. Light to light/medium body. Sits more to the dry side. Nice...  Drinkability: Very high if you're a hop-head. If not, stay away because the incredible flavor will only come across as blinding bitterness.  This is my first year trying this brew and I must say that I'm quite impressed. It's like their fantastic Pale Ale, but taken to the next level. I'll look forward to this next year...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Rayek,3.73,"A: Amber with good clarity and minimal carbonation. Rocky off-white head starts out large, retains well and leaves generous lace.  S: Pine, grapefruit and lemon hit the nose in order. Some toasted malt aroma sits in the back.  T: The beer is dominated by a moderately high bitterness. Grapefruit and lemon make up most of the bitter flavor, with an extra earthy kick along to help. A toasted biscuit flavor from the malt rides underneath. Finishes tart and dry.  M: Medium body feels oily. Initial carbonation felt high, but settled down as the beer sat.  D: A nice IPA, but I think I'm starting to suffer from IPA burnout. Good, but not spectacular and sort of nondescript. Still worth a revisit next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Also citus notes and carmel malt  M&D: extremely drinkable beed despite slightly higher ABV. Light to medium bodied.  I have found a new favorite during the winter season.

140,1904,IBUnit63,3.89,"Originally reviewed in commemoration of my very first purchase from Belmont's first off-premise beverage store...since I picked up a case of 2008 at Costco and have been working these off for a while, time to give the 2008 its due. 12 oz. into a Duvel tulip...  Huge 3-finger dulce de leche head tops crisp copper body with almost soapy consistency (a little proofing dough too). Retention is excellent; beginning of Florentine lacing emerges. Quick, moderate carbonation. Good chunky seam. Not sure if there's anything wrong with this deal's look at all.  Powerful soapiness to overabundant hop profile; remainder is quite floral. Oiliness meshes with slightly metallic and carbonated tinge - stewy boiled crystal-ish malt is in the background with maybe a small caramel note. Looking for morse viscosity here. Despite the abundant nose, pulling back the onion leaves a little missing. Ruby Red grapefruit rind comes out slightly with warmth, along with an almost Saaz-ish silage feel.  This is very accessible...oiliness of hops comes through with a small amount of cinnamon and clove - crystal malt pokes through with a bit of caramel. Soapiness and floral nature of hops dominate - could use a little more citrus.  Of course this is quite good but I can get past the soapiness. It seems to be as designed but the package needs more balance on the malt side to round this out. Slightly astringent.  All told, a good sessionable brew - good for the gateway and readily available. Still, could use a little more steak than sizzle.  ---  Original text of 2/3/2008 review (2007 vintage): A- / 4.1 look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | drink: 4 First beer I ever purchased at the first ever off-premise liquor store in Belmont, MA.

Warm, solid effort for this vintage - excellent hop character well-blended with mild spice notes. Nice warming sense on the palate. For something that packs this much of a punch it drinks fairly easily. Well-done.  First beer I ever purchased at the first ever off-premise liquor store in Belmont, MA.

140,1904,ncstateplaya,4.4,"Actually, my serving types were many bottles...had to drink one a few days later to do the write-up.  Appearance: This ale poured cloudy with a nice deep amber and plenty of carbonation visible through the glass. A very effervescent brew with a beautifully creamy and frothy head. The head had great retention and left a substantial amount of lace in the glass.  Smell: The bouquet of this ale was very fragrant - especially with the hops. The malts were omnipresent and smelled delicious. There were also aromas of caramel and spicey undertones.  Taste: The bitterness from the hops nicely pairs with the malt backbone of this beer. There were hints of citrus fruit rounding out each swallow, followed by an almost candied or caramel flavor.  Mouthfeel: Great carbonation, never too much, just right, keeping each taste crisp and smooth. Each swallow left an almost sweet caramel like coating throughout the mouth.  Drinkability: The drinkability of this beer is outstanding! This well crafted beer is too smooth, too easy to drink, and too damn tasty. So why exactly is it a seasonal???",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Retention is decent before falling to a thin cap. Great lacing.  S - Huge grapefruit aroma with elements of pine and earthiness keeping things intersting. Slight aroma of sweet malt is in the background.  T - Grapefruit is the dominating factor here with a hint of earthiness. Alcohol peeks through at times and semi-sweet malt kicks in near the finish to balance out a moderate to high hop bitterness.  M - Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Prickly on the tongue.  D - Celebration is certainly a great IPA, but I had hoped it would be even better on tap than from the bottle. Still good, but some of the harshness around the edges is still evident.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,GordonQuid,4.47,"Poured a 12oz bottle to a freshly washed pint glass. Poured a deep mahogany with a rocky white 1 inch head and moderate lacing.  Smell is piney grapefruit, pineapple covering fresh biscuits.  Taste is a refreshing American style IPA; citrusy clean with a slight grain/chalky viscosity in the mouthfeel. There is a toasty sweet finish present.  Pleasantly drinkable. Comparable to Bell's Three hearted.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ThreeWiseMen,4.12,"Had this on-tap at Madera Golf and Country Club. This place has a very legit beer selection for a golf course.  Appearance: Body is a dark, clear, orange-amber with steady streams of carbonation within. Head is thin, white, creamy, and sticky. Great retention and nice lacing.  Smell: Pine, caramel, warm bread, red berries, spices, pie crust, and oily Cascade hops. Aromas mix together very nicely.  Taste: Starts out with caramel, pie crust, and more bready yeast. Eases into some light berry and strong spicy flavors, then finishes piney and very bitter. Tons of hops in this one.  Mouthfeel: Lots of spiciness and bitterness to this one. Medium-bodied, a bit creamy, and very crisp. Finishes drier than I'd like, but overall it's good.  Drinkability: Had a couple of these at the course today - couldn't resist. This is a must have every Christmas, though I don't think I could drink them forever. The bitterness/dryness is palate-wrecking and the body isn't nearly light enough. Still, a great brew!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The drink starts with a hop kick up front and goes quickly sweet with a fruit tone. The finish is nice hops that linger, but not too long. The hops are there but not oily, just a nice hop flavor.

140,1904,jiggahertz,3.48,"A: Deep amber with a soapy 2 finger head in a snifter. Head subsides leaving nice lacing all around. Islands of head float throughout the drink. Awesome webbed lacing throughout.  S: Floral hops up front along with grapefruit, orange and cinnamon.  T: Strong hops hit you right away, then orange followed by a subtle creaminess and bitterness lingers for a while. Grapefruit is too overpowering.  M: Medium body and carbonation. Hops definitely dominate the mouthfeel and linger after, but cover any alcohol taste nicely.  D: Ton of hops with very little malt to be found. Good drinkability for the ABV, but too much grapefruit for my taste.  If there was a value category this would be a 5, comes in right under $1/beer in NH. Nice to see a seasonal that isn't a winter warmer. Was expecting more from this beer after the great reviews here, left expecting more.

140,1904,PintOHops,4.73,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance/Smell - Appears a beautiful copper/amber color with about an inch of head that laces beautifully & holds well. Medium-high carbonation. Smells of sweet raisins with powerful floral, piny & citrusy hops. A nice roasted burnt malt aroma as well (Like burnt biscuits) Musky malt comes out as it warms, as well as a touch of alcohol.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of floral hops with a strong roasted/burnt malt flavor. Citrus, pine, and raisin notes as well, and as it warms a sweet malt flavor develops as well as some alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, chewy and rich. Medium bodied.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - Id say I would enjoy about two of these at the most. This is a rich full flavored ale that should be sipped & savored. I love this beer, although there's nothing special about it. If you haven't tried it, go for it. Its only out during the Christmas season! Don't wait till its to late, cheers everyone!

140,1904,jakeaustin,4.24,"Always look forward to the release of celebration ale. This is the beer that got me into hops and is still one of my favorites. Pours a pleasant orange/light amber into my SN hop tulip glass. The quarter inch of head stays around thanks to the hop etching in the bottom. Tons of nice thick lacing.  Smell is almost all hops. Taste is similar, mostly citrusy hops, some pine as well. Just enough malt to make this one very tasty well balanced IPA. Bitter as you'd expect but not overpowering. Very smooth taste/mouthfeel. If it wasn't for the slightly high ABV I could drink a bunch of these, and I just might anyways.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The aroma is nice with citrus and a little pine in the nose, and pale and caramel malt.  The flavor is not so much hops as is mild bitterness and toasty pale and caramel malts. A lot more hop flavor would be nice.  The palate couldv'e been a little more smooth, though I like the dryness in the finish.  A very, maybe too balanced IPA imo. This is an alright IPA by me, but nothing that really Wow-ed me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MarzenMan,3.8,Darker amber than I expected with a nice large head. Mostly citrusy hop on the nose.  Hoppy and bitter in the best way. Surprisingly more maltiness than I expected. Actually pretty well balanced.  Good mouthfeel. Fairly high carbonation but thick enough. As far as IPAs go this one is very drinkable. I can see how someone would claim this as a session beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,lhaqq,4.22,A: Little to no head and a golden amber body. S: Smell is mainly of hops. Kind of creamy and piney too. T: Main taste is a mix of floral and citrus hops. The citrusy flavor sticks a bit longer. Finishes pretty clean with little bitter aftertaste. M: Clean and smooth but also surprisingly creamy. D: Hides the 6.8 well. Could definitely enjoy a few.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,roscoehnj,4.38,Looks great; much more amber than pale which has always caused me to wonder why it is classified as an IPA. Modest head but nice lacing.  Your classic IPA nose with some grapfruit and floral notes.  Love this beer. IPA bitterness with a touch of malt backbone - you have to probe for the malt though - it is more apparent in the appearance. Beautiful nmouthfeel and oh so drinkable - could drink this all night.

140,1904,JMBSH,3.58,"A - Pours a hazy burn orange. Under strong light, I can see a large amount of unfiltered sediment in the beer. The thick head reduces to a thin coating on top of the beer but there is a large amount of foam clinging to the sides of the glass.  S - Piney, grassy notes. Smells like frshly cut in spring/summer.  T - Very herbal. A slight sweetness up front on the tongue but the bitterness rules afterwards. Bitter aftertaste is quite strong.  M - Thin but the hops stick to every part of my mouth, tongue, and throat giving a thicker feel. Mild carbonation.  D - For hopheads this might be a good beer. I prefer more of a malty beer but this is good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Augustiner719,3.93,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Fairly agressive pour yielded a moderate 2 finger head that dwindled down rather quickly. Great lacing.  Smell: Definate hops comming through. this is a good combination of a winter/ipa style beer. Its got more balls than the regualar SN IPA, and its also go some different aromas. I get some citrus from the hops, a sticky sugary aroma too. Some malt comming through and a little bit of grapfruit.  Taste: This is similar to the IPA. Where the SN IPA flourishes with its pinpoint flavors, this beer fails. Its a little confused, but in a good way. I get some dark malty flavors and some light citrusy flavors. Big grapefruit juice component on the front end with sweet sticky on the back end.  Mouthfeel: Good feel, its got some nice bubbles. carbonated well for the style, nice rounded feel after swallowing.  Drinkability: Nice beer. Its got some great flavors packed in there. Its abv is pretty high for a session beer but i can see where a lot of people would want to put a few of these puppies away.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - Lots of hops and some fruity notes, smells really good.  T - For an IPA this has a great balance, the hops aren't overwhelming and I imagine a first time IPA drinker would be able to enjoy this offering. Some citrus hints but overall just a really clean taste.  D - At only 6.8% abv I could drink a six pack of these without hesitation.

Taste: Piney hops up front and then a slight hint of malt at the finish. Hop bitterness lingers.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. Excellent balance on the carbonation.  Drinkability: Careful with this one!

140,1904,jjboesen,4.16,The Celebration begins beneath a thin cream-colored head that sits atop a light copper body. There is a minimal lacing present. The nose can detect a pleasant floral bouquet supplemented with cloves and cinnamon.  The Celebration offers a finely hop-malt balance with an initial hop blast followed by a comfortable maltish bite. All of this without the least bit of carbonation.  Methinks this to be another wonderfully drinkable ale from Sierra Nevada!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DmanGTR,4.45,"My first time with this beer was during Thanksgiving dinner but I wanted to review this by itself without the influence of food... so here goes my 2nd review with this loveliness....  A - poured a transparent dark amber/copper with a beautiful 1.5"" off-white head that laced beautifully and had excellent retention in my Ommegang goblet.  S - much going on here. A very floral bouquet consisting of herbal hoppiness and sweet caramel malts. Hints of plums and golden raisins mixed with slight tones of cream. Wonderful!  T - An initial malty sweetness, followed by juicy esters and quickly countered by herbal hops. Flavors of lemon zest, fresh hops, and molasses swirl before finishing bittersweet with a lasting aftertaste.  M - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Incredibly smooth  D - highly drinkable! One of the most drinkable IPA's I've ever had.  Overall - An excellent all-around IPA. Very complex and well balanced, yet simple enough for just pure enjoyment. A must for any hop head.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Colt4540,4.41,"A- Is a deep read that has a gold tint when held to the light. Poured into a pint glass, had a two finger peach head that leaves a one finger throughout the beer and leaves really good lacing.  S- HOPS. Alot of hops and a little bit of sweet maltiness.  T- It's wonderful. A Hoppy bitterness that finishes clean. Just enough hops to give it a good flavor and a good sticky bitterness taste.  M- BAM! It's crisp clean and bitter and goes down smooth.  D- Could easily drink a six pack. The only thing holding you back from drinking more is the high ABV.  Note- This beer even froze solid in the back of my truck and still tasted like a bitter sweet candy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BeanBone,4.8,"2009 Vintage Reviewed Shortly After Release:  Appearance: A hazy golden-amber body capped by over two fingers of creamy off-white head. The head sticks around until almost the bottom of the pint, leaving great lacing all the way down.  Aroma: A bright blast of citrusy (both sweet orange and bitter grapefruit) and piney hops over a big caramel malt backbone and perhaps a few whiffs of alcohol. Man, this is just what I've been looking forward to.  Flavor: Up front, a bitter wave of complex but seemingly uncomplicated grapefruity and sappy hops. Underneath, there's a solid bedrock of biscuity malt that plays a perfect counterpoint to the hops. This is balanced exquisitely, just as I've come to expect from Sierra Nevada. Biscuity grain and pleasant bitterness linger in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and a little creamy with good carbonation. Dry in the finish with just the barest hint of warmth from the alcohol.  Drinkability: If you like hops, this is something you can drink this all night--just try to remember it's nearly seven percent ABV.  Verdict: At first, this just seems like a tasty and nicely polished IPA--but there's just something about the hop flavors and near-perfect balance that tip this beer into greatness as you make your way through. A classic treat truly worth looking forward to all year.  ---  2008 Vintage Reviewed Shortly After Release:  Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy golden-amber below a glorious, two-finger off-white head with great lacing. Brilliant looking beer.  Aroma: Grapefruit, orange peel, and piney hops over a sweet, brown sugar malt. Everything is in it's perfect proportion here.  Taste: Piney and citrusy hops are in the forefront, with grapefruit and orange the dominant varieties of citrus. The malt backbone is mostly pale with some caramel coming through. Every now and then, a bit of alcohol shines through it all. This beer is sublimely balanced.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. The finish is a little dry and does well to keep the bitterness going.  Drinkability: I can knock these back all night long, although I'd probably be pretty buzzed by the end of the night...  Verdict: Simply one of the best American IPAs I've sampled yet, Celebration is certainly something I'll look for each Winter. Miles ahead of Sierra Nevada's other seasonal IPA, Anniversary Ale, this is the Sierra Nevada IPA to get.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Docer,2.91,"6-pack bottles purchased. Poured into a tumbler glass.  Great copper-like amber color, very nice lacing.. hardly any head. Slightly cloudy appearance.  Mild smell, but with a sour-like barley wine odor. Can smell the alcohol for sure.  Taste is just ""ok"" for me. Caramel malt flavor with a wildly sour and bitter hop bite. Essence of barrel aged barley wine notes... slightly earthy and dirty notes with a bit of pine and dry hop. Tastes stronger in ABV than it's listed 6.8%.  Leaves mouth a bit dry and parched. Bitter/sour finish.  Not too easy to drink mainly because of the flavor. Not a huge fan of this one. Burns, heartburn from the alcohol... not much there to hide that taste. Too malty.

140,1904,Bootscraper,4.47,"First of all, I must note that IPA style beers are not typically the type I would buy first, but I shall judge this beer accordingly for what it is, and not my personal preference. Served at about 50 degrees F in pint glass. Listening to: Manheim Steamroller- ""A Fresh Aire Christmas""  Upon pour, a magnificent 1/2 inch creamy (but quite slopey) off-white head frothed up, that quickly settled down to about 1cm. Golden orange in color with obvious champagne-esque carbonation. The Lacing was pretty spotted, but could cling to the glass like an obsessive ex-girlfriend. The head slowly developed into just a thin layer as I approached the bottom of my glass. A good whiff gives you a thick nose full of fresh savory hops. It serves as a good precursor of what's to come, and the bouquet is considerably flowery. Perhaps there may also be a pinch of vanilla in there as well, not sure. The taste, unsurprisingly, is quite bitter with hops, but is not too harsh (a pretty warm and smooth ""bitter"", actually... if that makes any sense) and slightly fruity. Really, the hops were either well chosen, well prepared, or both. It was only very slightly sticky, but medium to full-bodied. I think it may be a small bit too carbonated, but the beer makes up for this with that good head, and the fact that the burps themselves are damn tasty. The drinkability is hit or miss with this one. If you really like to taste the hops, you will love this beer. But if you don't, the bitter taste may be too overwhelming and metallic. I hosted a christmas party with these, and there was no complaints. So yeah, I say do the same. It just wouldn't be a bad idea to have a milder beer for others on the side. Happy holidays, everyone!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,showell,4.33,"Appears caramel with a nice tan to white head.  Smells very nice, sort of citrus.  Tastes of very strong hops. Nice and citrus. Quite bitter, but the aftertaste mellows somewhat, so it leaves you with a nice citrus flavor. There's another IPA that escapes me that this is almost a dead ringer for. Wish I could remember which one it was! It has a bit of a sweeter taste than you'd expect from an IPA. Do they do something to it special to make it a holiday brew?  I wish I could get this year round. I wouldn't buy it every day, but I certainly would buy it more than just during the holiday season. Very nice ale.  ___  I originally reviewed this in Dec 2008. I noticed that they have this year's out, and so had to get it. Better than ever! Originally I said I wouldn't buy it every day? Well I was wrong. This beer is outstanding. Do yourself a favor and try it. Your tastebuds will thank you. - Nov 2009.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mullenite,4.1,"Poured a rich amber with a 3 finger off white head made up of a very chunky foam. Lasted a decent amount and left an okay lacing on the glass (left a lacing but it was not by any means sticky.)  Smell is all hop. Grapefruit/citrus aromas dominate.  Taste is bitter hops, mainly grapefruit flavors left over from the aroma. A little sweetness on the back end but finishes with the same citrus hops from the tip. Very bitter for a winter seasonal and grading it as a seasonal I would mark it lower as a pale ale however this is exactly what I'd expect.  Medium-light body, crisp carbonation, both of which are not something I really want in a winter beer but that I do want in a pale ale.  Very easy to drink beer, great tastes throughout but something I think I'd prefer in the summer rather than the winter. If I were to review this as a winter beer it would be scored quite a bit lower than it is currently.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Ghosts? lol  Smell - Caramel malts and citrus hops in harmony. So beautiful.  Taste - Hops take over here, and its both piney and citrusy. The malts still are very present trying to round it out, but not quite making it. Still provides an excellent taste. Slight hint of butter and a dash of sugar on the finish.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and creamy with a hearty amount of carbonation.  Drinkability - These go too quickly to fathom.

Ironically, I'm someone that until very recently said he liked any beer except IPA's. I stand corrected. It's a beer all about hops. My wife described it as ""bitter"" but I disagree.

140,1904,tzchandler,4.3,I was drawn to this beer hearing that is dry-hopped. The aroma and flavor are a big step up from the more common India Pale Ale. The aroma is very nice. I can think of no other mass produced IPA that comes close to this except for Little Creatures Pale Ale (Australia).  Possibly a bit darker than I would expect in a IPA but for the price this is an outstanding value and wish it was not just available during the holidays.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S=Hops Hops Hops! Good for this style and very fresh smelling.  T=Surprisingly good. Goes in with a light fruity hop and a lemony aftertaste. Not particularly a favorite style of mine, but as far as beers of the American IPA style that I have tried, this is really good.  M=looking at this I figured I was about to take a carbon bomb, but it goes down really well. Carbonation is just right and the beer walks the good line with a medium body.

T: Bitter and citrusy hops hit the palate immediately. grapefruit, and orange are most obvious.

M: Carbonation and hops are brilliant on the tongue. medium bodied, great winter beer viscosity.  D: even tho this beer is hoppy, the hops are mouthwateringly delicious. It doesnt dry out the palate and definetely leaves you wanting more.

You can smell lots of caramel malts with a subtle hop spice aroma. There is a citrus under tone to this brew.

140,1904,Reaper16,4.54,"served from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Poured a coppery, dark orange color. Decent amount of off-white head that dissipated sort-of quickly but left lots of spidery lacing behind it. Visible yeast sediment in the glass.  This beer was exceptional in the aroma department. A strong kick to the rear end of various types of hops dominates the nose. A touch of honey, maybe? A lot of pine. The hops, though, are intense and very enticing.  Wow. This is what I am looking for in an American IPA. Cascade and Chinook working together to scrape my tastebuds off (in a good way). Juicy, floral, fragrant. But the malt is there, too, whispering in my ear not to forget it. Sweet, a little bit toasty. I wouldn't call this balanced by any means, but who cares. This is incredibly delicious.  The mouthfeel is spot-on, like most Sierra Nevada offerings that I've had. Great aftertaste of bitter hops, finishing fairly dry. One of my favorite things about IPAs are the ""hop burps,"" and I'm getting some pleasant belches out of this beer. I'm not really feeling the effects of the 6.8% ABV, but I'm not drinking a sixer, either. From what I can tell, though, this is very drinkable. I want to drink this much faster than I should because it tastes so damn good.  I really got into beer earlier this year, so this is the first year that I've been able to try Celebration Ale. To say that it didn't disappoint would be a severe understatement.

I missed so much of the value of the brew by not being able to smell it...  Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. A medium pour reveals a big head--three fingers of off-white fluff that threatens to overflow the glass. Retention is awesome and lacing encircles the entire glass. The beer is amber and just a bit hazy.  Aroma is big-time hops. There are traces of pine, grapefruit, and soap. There is also something that smells slightly off. It smells just a bit like rotten vegetables.  The flavor is very bitter--pucker your face, taste buds running for cover bitter. If there are another other hop flavors they are suppressed by the bitterness. There is also a metallic taste that comes through after the bitterness. No real malt character.  Mouthfeel is very nice. Just a little bit thick, a little bit oliy. The mouth is left coated slightly. Carbonation is medium to high.  I used to be a major hop-head, but I can feel that fading. I am wishing now that I had a malty brew to follow this one with. It is a good IPA, but not a session beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Great hoppy aroma comes right out and slaps you in the dome piece! God damn this is where I could really tell it's an IPA. Maybe some pine up in the mix. GREAT HOLIDAY BEER.

Wonderful flavour profile with malt & hoppiness with more punch coming from the hop.  Mouthfeel is excellent and reminiscent of a SN beer.  Drinkability is what this beer is about. Would love to try a pint of it on tap but still a very sessionable brew.

140,1904,PonyBar,3.73,"This holiday offering from Sierra Nevada was poured from a 12oz bottle into a clean, clear 16oz mixing (pint) glass. The appearance is more cloudy than I remember from years past, with a slightly hazy, orange color. The smell is one of alcohol, with an ABV of 6.8% There is a nice residue of brewer's lace forming along the side of the glass as well. The taste is one of a highly drinkable IPA. There is a lingering bite of hops on the tounge, and a floral finish typical of IPAs. Most Christmas beers are loaded with spices, fruits, or some other type of flavoring, but not this beer, which is nice. I also like the fact that Sierra Nevada puts the ABV on the bottle. All breweries should do this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,biegaman,4.15,"Copper plated amber that shines like a bright, shiny new penny. Little fluttering bubbles ensure that the background is consistently filled with movement. Ivory tinted head had accumulated to a gigantic level but slowly sank into a creamy, low lying mousse. Complex honeycombs of lace attest for the formally mammoth capping.  The hops hit first, and then second and third as well. It is a showcase of all characteristics both fruity and floral. The sappy, sticky resin of pine needles and spruce tips fill the air, all the while orange peel and big juicy grapefruits resonate throughout the nasal sinus. If you even remotely like the smell of hops, then you'll love this.  I'm happy to find the taste to have as much hop presence as the aroma. Just as the bouquet was fruity and floral, we find notes of spruce, pine, and sticky but subdued citrus rampant in the flavour as well. A strong, sturdy cast of sticky sweet malts introduces light hints of toffee coated wafers and caramel dipped biscuits.  That play between hop and malt not only makes for a delicious flavour, but also a very well balanced beer. This tight-rope act between sweet and bitter makes for a drinkability beyond what I can imagine. One instance it's sweet, the next it's bitter; the only constant is a smooth, satisfying presence on the palate.  Although aging IPA's is generally a misnomer, many people will collect Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale for vertical tastings. I myself have a vintage collection stashed away in the cellar and I always enjoy dipping into it around the holidays. Yes the hops fade and the malt comes forth, but from my experience the distinction from year to year is far more complex...  Sierra Nevada always provides me with a little extra incentive to 'celebrate' during the Christmas season. I'd definitely recommend picking up at least a sixer of this seasonal when available. Even if not to age, I can assure you finishing it off fresh will be no chore. This is a wonderful beer and certainly one worth tasting at all stages of its life.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,popery,4.42,"2008. Celebration pours amber and clear with a sticky off-white head and nice lacing. The smell is pine, caramel, bitter citrus and, although this is repetitive, distinctly hoppy. The flavor is cleanly bitter with hop flavors that come through with more pine and floral strength than citrus. I'm not a big fan of their pale ale. I appreciate Sierra Nevada and their role in brewing, but it almost seems like they sacrifice some quality to pump out so much of the pale ale. The Celebration strikes me as the beer that the pale ale should be. The hops are clear, clean and bitter. There are no off-flavors and the whole package is immensely drinkable. The feel is a tad watery, but it doesn't get in the way of the flavor. Sierra Nevada is obviously capable of making great beer and lots of it. I just wish I could find this beer as easily as the pale ale and all year round. In my mind, this is the definitive American IPA against which all others should be judged.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ahalloin,4.03,"Poured from the 12 oz. short bottle. The appearance is just about picture perfect with a deep gold color including hints of amber and a big frothy head that lingers a bit in the glass and clings to the side as you drink it down. The aroma consists of a great mix of citrus, carmel, and some cinnamon. The flavor is dominated by the hops, as it should be in the American IPA style. The flavor starts off somewhat soft with carmel malts, but leads into a burning acidic citrus hop flavor that hangs on your taste buds long after you swallow. The finish is dense pine. Fabulous! Mouthfeel is mostly what you would expect from Sierra Nevada; very solid but not out of the ordinary. I think it is rightly drinkable, but fizzy yellow beer drinkers might not dig the uber acidic hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The alcohol becomes more evident as it warms up, but in the throes of a cold New England winter, I love it.  I find SNCA to be versatile enough to drink with any type of meal, from hearty pot roast to spicy Thai food.  It's even better to have on draft - but be careful, the alcohol can sneak up on you.

Lots of hops in the nose... pine, malt, delicious. with a nice foamy head.  You can polish off a sixer of these during a football double-header no problem. One of the staples of craft brewery...

Celebration has a bitter hoppy taste, but finish with a hint of caramel and malt.  It has a fully body with light carbonation.  Sierra Nevada Celebration has a great taste.

Taste: I don't know what to say. My first reaction was good - up front it is fruity and floral and quite pleasant. Unfortunately, there's a lingering aftertaste that sticks to the sides of my mouth. It might be cinnamon, but it's really just medicinal. I wanted to like this beer, but I had a hard time finishing it.

140,1904,aforbes10,3.31,"Sixer from a liquor store in Dixon, CA. Pours a hazy brownish red with a short white head and sticky lacing. Caramel malt and slightly stale hop odor. Flavor is a big blast of bitter, lemony hops and sweet, biscuity malt. Bitterness lingers for a long time. Kind of sticky mouthfeel. Drinks ok, but a little boring. I've liked Celebration a lot in the past, especially on draft, but something about this year's batch or the bottling or something just isn't all that great.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beer2day,4.47,"My favorite beer of the season. Tasting a cellared 07 vs an 08.  08 might be a tad bit darker than the 07, but not by much. 07 produced more head, as could well be expected.  07 slightly nosier, both with a citrusy aroma.  07 hits harder and finishes stronger. This beer did very well in the cellar. The 08 is very good, just not as flavorful as the 07.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The initial tastes compliment each other well then the hops really comeback and become overly aggressive as part of the aftertaste...  M - Dry... Light to medium bodied... Mild carbonation... Crisp...  D - In my mind this is a one trick brew... Hops and lots of them being the trick... Looks great but proceeds to disappoints in all other facets... Lack complexity and isn't balanced...,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BeerRican,4.03,"I also am a first timer for this and any holiday brew. I was very much drawn to it in my grocery store cooler. I like everything by Sierra Nevada, why not Celebration Ale?  Well I must say that it is unique, curious, but impressive. Much different than I expected, but inviting and left me wanting to take another sip to analize it further.  The color is an awesome bronze with an amber touch. It is clear with a pretty white head and nice lacing.  The smell is a pleasant citrus, hops, and spicy blend that made me stick my nose deeper in my pint glass.  The taste is great, great mouthfeel, questionable aftertaste. A bit bitter for my tastebuds. Good amount of carbination.  Celebration Ale definetly tastes like winter in a bottle. I look forward to drinking my next bottle.

140,1904,TheycallmeTim,3.76,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an American pint glass.  A--Pours a clear shiny penny body with a two finger egg-nog colored (for the holidays) dense foamy head. Head retention is first-rate, and the lacing is predominant. Actually looks like a slightly darker pumpkin ale, like Smutty's.  S--Doesn't smell like it, though! This is almost all honey and hops to me, specifically tropical fruit like pineapple and mango, rather than the more citrusy nuggetjuicebomb that is their Harvest Wet Hop. Sweet and biting on the nostrils at the same time.  T--Last description fits the flavor profile as well. Plenty bitter, with a definite Cascade hop presence that keeps your tongue (happily) dry with pine mixed with candied dried pineapple. The real story to me here, though, is the richness of the malt--this has roasty flavor behind the hops that's like whole wheat toast with honey on it. It's hard to discern but you can capture it at the very beginning of the sip, before the hop flume ride commences. The depth of the malt character makes this a standout winter beer to me, like a beefy, harvest IPA.  M&D--Mouthfeel on SN beers is insanely good. I don't think I've scored one below a 4.5. Keep em comin' in that dept. My only gripe is the alcohol level, which keeps my ability to drink vast quantities at a minimum, which keeps me sad...  A great representative of the dry biting windy winters of parts of California and the west in general. Great stuff!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DefenCorps,4.03,"2008 release into my Sam Smith nonic pint  A: Clear copper colored pour with a gorgeous off white head with great retention. As the head slowly recedes, it leaves a trail of sticky lace. Awesome  S: On the nose, this beer is a solid pine assault with some citrus. Mild malt presence in the back. Very hop driven, though, with pine, orange rind, candied pineapple and the like. Cascade presence is noticeable  T: Up front is an aggressive pine bitterness along with a sharp, earthy citrus bitterness. Malt is pretty nonexistent with a mild sweet component. In the battle between flavor and bittering hops, this leans heavily towards the bittering end and if that's your thing, this beer is quite stellar. On the finish is more orange zest bitterness. Awesome  M: Light on the palate with lively carbonation, this one's solid. The bitterness is high and enjoyable  D: I've drunk a bunch of this and enjoyed it every single time. The high bitterness might make it difficult for me to drink a sixer but a bottle or two? No problem!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kaseydad,4.3,"One of my favorite holiday beers bar none.  It is a great looking beer and I like the change to the bottle..using more burgandy (red) on the label. Feels more like X-mas. The hoppy taste and sharp bite welcomes the harsh winter months ahead to my palate . A fingers width of foam is present which quickly disappears but leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Taste seems the same as I mentioned earlier. Hoppy, citrus and piney is the aroma I pick up. The 6.8% alchohol is masked well and it's easy to go through a few of these at on seating. It is also a nice cold weather beer.  For the price it can't be beat and compared to a lot of the X-mas beers, this is one of the better ones. A fantastic beer from SN.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Everything up front is hops, with some malt and spices mellowing out the finish. Maybe some caramel flavor too, there's definitely something sweet.  M - Crisp and medium bodied.  D - Very drinkable.

A doughy, chewy taste reminiscent of biscuits with great hop attack to follow. A dab of pepper and spice...and BAM! the concoction is finished.

140,1904,Morbo,4.41,"A somewhat aggressive pour yields a frothy two finger off white head atop a beautiful crystal clear coppery-orange body. There is so much lacing you could count my sips, like growth rings on a tree.  And a mighty tree it is, the nose exudes resinous pine. In the background there is some citrus, mostly grapefruit but I'm getting sweet and juicy tangerine as well.  There is a hint of sweet caramel on the tip of the tongue and then the hops takeover. Grapefruit dominates with pine playing second fiddle, basically the reverse of the nose. Finishes moderately bitter with some spiciness and floral accents.  Medium in body and carbonation with a nice creamy mouthfeel and long oily finish.  This one is very hoppy, but not abrasively so. There is just enough caramel maltiness to keep the bitterness in check. For a hoppy IPA coming in at almost 7% abv this is extremely sessionable, I could drink it all night. For me this years Celebration Ale belongs to the highest tier of IPAs, its release makes Chicago winter a bit more tolerable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

This is a very delicious-looking beer.  s- smell is huge pine and a little bit of fruit and spices. some citrus character comes through slightly.  t- initially I'm surprised by the massive hop flavor. Tastes floral/piney throughout, but some nice bready malts, hint of sweetness and wintery spice to balance. Finish is a pleasant lingering pine taste and bread dough. Alcohol beautifully masked. Man, this is so good.  m- goes down smoother than any pale ale I've had. Carbonation is nice and subtle. Maybe just a tad too watery.  d- well, this is it folks. I admit I've been a malts guy through and through up until now. This is the beer the opened my eyes. Give me 6, please.  Absolutely phenomenal beer.

S: The nose is a sharp pine coupled with a light citrus before hopps come to town ending with the malt to prove Sierra Nevada can balance 'em well.  T: Spritely noble hop entrance added with malt to be a smooth delivery. Pine and lemon come through in the aftertaste.  M: Medium moving to large and again excellent retention.  D: After hearing friends form Florida to Philly speak of Celebration Ale in the same week, I was glad to try this one out.

Fantastic IPA flavor, with a strong bite and aftertaste! The only reason it doesn't get 5 is that I have had better so I know improvement is possible, but not by anything but the absolute best.  The strong hop flavor is great but it could have been just me but while I enjoyed it it hit the stomach kind of rough.  Overall, I doubt you could find a better beer that is as easy to find across the U.S. Shame that this is a seasonal and they don't make this year round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

This was the 2008 Celebration.  A- Poured an orange copper color with a really nice 2 finger cream head that lasted about half the glass. It had a nice cloud of sediment that kind of floated in the middle untill it finally settled to the bottom. Nice haevy lace rings to the bottom.  S- First smell is of fresh hops. Nice citrus smell of grapefruits with a floral piney smell. I could also detect some malt and a light grassy note.  T- Very citrus with alot of grapefruit and lemons. It also had heavy floral pine note with hints of toasted malts and white pepper. Not much alcohol bite as expected, but a very balanced flavor with a slight bitter after taste. Over all impression was of fresh hops.  M- It had a very nice rich mouthfeel that worked well with the amount of carbonation it had.  D- I loved it! I could drink several of these at one session. I have heard the 2008 is less hoppy than the past years and if thats the case I would love to find a 2007! I will definatly seek this out a season long. Its a nice alternative to the winter spiced beers. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I have already had this year's Celebration (in a bottle)and as usual I'm a fan, but it is very different out of the tap.  The aroma is awesome. Big hit of fresh piney hops with some citrus and floral as well. At first I thought, this isn't the same beer I had in the bottle, but the spices come through in the taste without losing any of that fresh raw hop flavor. This is a winter warmer for the hopheads. The cinnamon and other festive spices play second fiddle to the hops but the flavor and aroma are BIG. I thoroughly enjoyed the one I had, but I did actually only have one.  Get a case to share during the holidays, but get out there and try a draft, I think you'll notice a big difference",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Settles into a permanent ring with an assload of lacing.  The smell is muted. I can tell that there's some piny hops to be found within, they just aren't too strong on the nose.  The taste is damn good. There's nothing muted about the piny hop bitterness in the flavor of CA. There's a small hint of caramel malt sweetness to be found behind the heaping helping of hops. Delicious.  Mouthfeel is essentially what to expect from the style. It's not as creamy as a Two-Hearted or Stone, but it does have a good, crisp finish with hearty dryness.

Also, some floral notes shining through. Bitter, oily aftertaste. Awesome.  Smooth and well carbonated, leaving a rough and hoppy feeling in the mouth.  Drinkable if you're into hops.

Would have liked a spicy kick, but instead very smooth finishing, which is still good.  M - Great mouthfeel for an IPA, clean and full.  D - Keep em coming!  Another great IPA.

T: Here the piney hoppiness takes the reigns and is followed closely by a bit of pineapple, aspirin, toasty malt, caramel, and a touch of lemon during the finish.  M: Very sticky and oily.

It had a very nice off white head which stayed throughout the glass with very nice lace. Pretty much what a beer should look like.  S - Obviously hops are the predominant scent upon first smell with the same aroma of SN's pale ale but a little bit sweeter due to the different hop variety. Other than hops there isn't much there...maybe a little caramel-ish in the background.  T - Same thing here, hops up front at first due to the dry-hopping but they dilute quickly to a nice subtle fruity/sweet flavor, quite the nice transition. Great carbonation as well, not too much and not too little.  M/D - Very easy to drink if you enjoy hops and a semi-complex flavors.

D: Very flavorful and refreshing. Really excites the mouth.  A good combination of flavors. Hoppy and bitter, but not so much so that it distracts from the great taste. Really good to sip. Worth rinsing the palette before drinking this one so as not to miss anything.  Incidentally, also had this from the tap (which this review is not based on).

Hops are up front and lasting till the bitter end. Pine dominates over citrus. A strong malt backbone accompanies the bitter flavor. Well balanced.  M - Drying and smooth. Medium bodied.  D - This one never seems to tire on the taste buds.

Good, floral citrus nose loaded with orange, grapefruit, but also some raisin. Excellent hopped taste, very fruity, but with a solid malty spine providing a nice roasted flavor. This is truly excellent stuff. Creamy smooth with a good, rough hopped texture, Celebration Ale is rich and well balanced. It's also all too easy to consume, sterling offering from Sierra Nevada, one of its best with Bigfoot and the Wet Hopped Ale.  It also went very well with Obama's election victory, but I had to sample it again recently since I did a lot of celebrating November 4, and was in no shape to write an adequate beer review. A magnificent brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Jablonski,4.18,"Poured into a pint glas  Appearance: pours a bronzed-orange color and the orange comes out more when held to light; the head pours large and remains for quite a while  Smell: surprisingly light smell; the hops are apparent, but not as strong as I would've liked; also hints of citrus and malts  Taste: hops and bitterness very apparent with a bit of citrus  Mouthfeel: maybe a bit overcarbonated, but not by much  Drinkability: easy to have more than one at a time; nice beer, and not too heavy",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TheDoorman,3.8,"Transparant amber complexion with a sturdy off-white head. Nose of hops with a hint of spice. Palate full of hops, but not overwhelmingly. Tasty and bitter, but not overdone. This is a pretty earthy tasting hop variety, florals are there too though. Not the citrus flavors I was expecting. Bitter, dry finish. A fantastic IPA.  This is a very nice IPA. But doesn't Sierra Nevada already have one of these, ya know, with a lime-green label?  My gripe with this beer is not that it isnt a very nice IPA, but that it simply is not a winter season beer. I just don't see any seasonal angle, any real spicyness or warmth that an Xmas ale should provide. For that reason, I'll have to give this a low drinkability score.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,drseamus,4.07,Served on tap at Mahars.  Pours a nice red amber body with a nice white head. The nose is pretty floral and hoppy. A good citrus and sweetness. Taste is quite similar with a good bitterness up front and a nice caramel malt undertone. Bitterness lasts into the aftertaste. Fairly low carbonation. Good beer on tap but I'd like a touch more hop flavor to balance the bitteness.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TrevorGW,4.43,An IPA disguised as a Winter Warmer. A great idea considering that most Winter beers are blah.  The body of the beer really glows. And it holds a great head.  Crisp and oily hop flavor. Really bites you up front and sticks on the tongue - a welcome attack. The key is that the malt really holds its own and stands up to the cascades. A good balance is struck. A creamy mouthfeel that you can always rely on from SN's yeast.  I'll be getting some more of these.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,StarlightSeraph,4.2,"Had this on draft a few weeks ago at Recreation Billiards in Winston-Salem. I liked it a lot, so I bought a six-pack. Poured into a pint glass...  Appearance: Beautiful reddish-gold color. Poured with about an inch of head, 1/4 of which lingered to the very end. Good amounts of lacing throughout as well.  Smell: Overpowering hops aroma...not that that's a bad thing. Very faint citrus aroma (other people have said grapefruit?) in the background. If you're a hophead, like I am, it's a very good start.  Taste: If you like IPAs, you will like the taste of this beer. The hops taste overpowers and pervades, and lingers for awhile as an aftertaste. I really didn't taste anything other than the hops, so the flavor is rather one-dimensional. But still, very good. Hints of citrus are barely noticeable.  Mouthfeel: Perfectly carbonated for an IPA. The hops and carbonation combine for a bitterness that stays with you. Thicker mouthfeel than I expected for a lighter-colored beer.  Drinkability: It depends. If you like hops, it's easy to put down a couple of these. However, the bitterness keeps you from drinking them too quickly. The aftertaste is very prevalent in the beer, making it more important to savor every sip.  Overall, this is an excellent beer. It's a nice departure from the traditional 'Winter Warmer' seasonal (not that there's anything wrong with them!) for this time of year. It's a quality beer, but I don't necessarily see anything that stands out about it. That being said, it's a high-quality IPA, and one that I'd recommend to anyone who likes hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BeardedBoffin,4.2,"A 2008 version of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. The snowy country scene on the bottle is encircled by an arrangement of poinsettias. The beer pours a nice amber color with an impressively stubborn and sticky head that left lacing throughout. The aroma signals the hops about to be consumed. Citrus, pine, and herbal round out the bouquet. When the beer is cold, hops assault the palate in a very impressive, enjoyable way with floral bitterness and citrus acidity. As the beer warms a nutty and bready malt character emerges to provide balance to the hoppy onslaught. Warm or cold the beer is a pleasant experience. The medium bodied ale flows across palate and leaves a dry lingering bitterness. As the beer vanishes you can start to feel a warmness in your chest, reminding you that this is winter beer after all. If you have a vessel containing Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale in your hand, celebrate, celebrate indeed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dickieb,4.33,"Cant believe i have never reviewed this one. Pours a clear amber orange in color with a 3 finger fluffy head and some great lacing. The smell is very hoppy with mostly lemon citrus hops coming through a bit of pine and some grainy malts. The flavor is is bitter with citrus flavor and a medium malt profile for the style, nothing out of the ordinary everything is just right for and American IPA. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy and it drinks like almost 7% however I could and have sessioned this one. A very good example of the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Mosstrooper,3.95,"Poured from 12oz into Guinness branded tulip pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a medium tan color with a medium sized, light-tan head with lots of lacing left behind.  Smell: Hops! Earthy, nutty, and slightly musty. A bit of toastiness, as well.  Taste: Bitter and nutty flavors with a slight note of biscuity malts.  Mouthfeel: Thin to medium bodied with a sharp carbonation and a dry finish.  Drinkability: I can't usually drink more than 2 IPAs or so in a sitting and this one is no exception. That being said, this is still an enjoyable, complex, and pretty hoppy beer that is affordable and fairly common. Recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,magnj,4.5,"Since you can't review beers more than once, I'll do it this way. The score reflects the most recent years review. 2009 --- a - Orange-amber body is quite clear, sits below a generous off white head that leaves lacing all the way down.  s - Pine and earthy hop aromas with big sweet caramel malts in the back.  t - Big hop bite and flavor up front following through to the end. After the initial bitterness fades the pine flavor melds with the sweet and sticky caramel malts to produce that rich signature west coast style IPA.  m/d - Stick full body fells appropriate considering the flavor and alcohol content. So easy to drink, I generally like to try a few different beers during a session but I want to stick with this one tonight.  2008 --- a - Nice amber color, but the real nice bit is the chunky 3 finger head and subsequent lacing.  s - Hops obviously, Pine and something sweet  t - Bitter all the way through but balanced by sweet malts toward the end making for a very well rounded pale, though the alcohol comes on a little hard as it gets warmer.  m/d - Light mouthfeel considering the big flavor which makes for nice drinkability. Feels stronger than 6.8%, makes for a nice drink on a cold night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TeamSeabass,4,"Reviewing this one is especially nice since I'm on my lunchbreak from work...  Pours a nice orangeish color with a small head in the 20 oz. tulip glass. Not much lacing.  Very hoppy smell with lots of pine. It carries right through to the taste. Lots of strong hops, lemony citrus and bitterness on the drink. Moreso than a regular SNPA. The bitterness lingers pretty strong but its quite nice.  The stronger flavor means sipping this one a little slower than a regular SNPA.

140,1904,Reagan1984,4.06,"Very nice 3 finger head that was creamy with a great deal of structure. Deep orange/amber in color and quite translucent. Great lacing and a touch of visible carbonation.  Floral and Piney aroma. Fresh and fantastic. This short description is not an indication that it wasn't great. It smells wonderful.  Reminds me a bit of Hop Rod Rye...(a top beer for me) Very nice. Certainly hop focused, but with a hearty malt backbone. Some interesting toasted...almost roasted malt flavors. Then the fresh pine hop nature kicks in.  The mouth feel is great and very interesting. The flavor lingers in the tongue and remains complex there.  Very drinkable. I can see why a buddy of mine enjoys this on tap at his house all through the winter.  Great stuff...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mnstorm99,4.16,"Had this on tap and in a bottle, easily better on tap so this is my review. Decent looking clear orange copper pour with a thick white head that sticks around for the duration. Aroma is the star of this party, not much malt aroma, but it is there, this one is almost all hops piney, and sweet hops are noticeable. Taste is very good, caramel and base malts give just enough backbone for this slightly dry IPA, but again the standout is spicy, citrus, piney hops. Mouthfeel is just a touch thin for me, but not a big deal as this is a surprisingly drinkable IPA for a dryer IPA (not my favorite type).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

There are also some spices to go along with the citrus hop flavor and it has a nice full, crisp feel. I really dig this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Large amounts of pine hops with a nice bitterness to them. Some very muted spices in it, cinnamon amybe deep in there with some cloves? M= highly carbonated which I enjoy for this style. medium body feels great D= very high. over all it's a great beer, the hoppy taste to it reminds me a lot of the surly's furious that I enjoy so much.

The head dissipates slowly into a patchy layer of bubbles on top and a thick ring around the glass. Lacing is pretty sticky.  Smells mostly of pine with hints of grapefruit and a good malty backbone. The grapefruit seems just a tad more pungent than in the bottle.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Pine and malt flavors up front with a bit of a grapefruit flavor and a solid bitter ending. Again, the grapefruit is slightly more evident here than in the bottle.  Mouthfeel is good. Good thickness and good carbonation make this one go down smoothly.  Drinkability is good.

T - Very hoppy to the point of overpowering the spices and malt. Very 'green' tasting and bitter.  M - Lots of carbonation and fairly thin. Not the cleanest finish, either.  D - This one is definitely made for the hopheads, which I am not. When I think holiday beers, I envision something a bit more malty with spices.

Also some sweet cinnamon, and a little malt as well.  T: Rather hoppy, but very balanced by the malt. A definite hop ale when it just seems a little too old out for a Pale.  M: Easy drinking, medium-bodied. Comparable to the Pale Ale, especially with its 6.8 abv.

140,1904,Pencible,3.76,"2008 vintage - fresh. This poured a clear copper with fluffy tan head. It smelled like orange and grapefruit hops with a bit of creamy malt. It tasted like strong grapefruit hops with pine and copper, and a bit of caramel malt and mulled spices. More of the spices came out as it warmed. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall (fresh) this was very similar to Sierra Nevada's regular Pale Ale. It was fairly clean and easy to drink.

140,1904,bamadog,4.35,"Just a note, I had to correct this posting because I initially posted it under the Anniversary Ale - a total sin. However, I have now seen fit to rectify the situation and now have my review under the appropriate beer.  Appearance: Poured a cloudy dark coppery/orange with a solid two finger head that stood for a bit -- eventually faded to a thin layer on top that is like a thick foam. Left a lacing all the way to the top on the side of the glass as I drank it.  Smell: Smelled bitter from the hops, which is always exciting. Also, a nice earthy, piney/grassy to the bitterness.  Taste: Hoppy bitterness abounds. Definitely a lot like the smell as well - a little earthy. A nice touch and comes across refreshing. I love the bitterness -- kind of serves as a wake up call and brings you around. You definitely don't forget you're drinking it.  Mouthfeel: Kind of sticky/oily -- leaves a nice coating. I do wish it went down a little cleaner, but it's a price I'm willing to pay.  Drinkability: I would give it a high rating. I feel I must work through it as the bitterness is such a dominant feature.  This is a great beer -- I haven't had a whole lot of the Sierra Nevada collection at this point, but I may be opening up to them shortly after this.

Big citrus on the nose, with lots of grapefruit oils, but also some pine and floral hops. Excellent hop bite on the tongue, with the malts struggling to keep up, but making their presence felt as the drink warms. The hops are all about the grapefruit, but there's some pine present as well, and they provide a great backbone to the slightly drying finish.

S - Great aromas come off this beer, a lot of citrus (orange & grapefruit), with some malt to.  T - A very good tasting beer.

The case handle broke and I lost one little soldier to the garage floor. This review is a tribute to that little bottle.  A: Nice deep amber that looks more yellow amber on the edges. A little hazy. Pours a nice 2 finger yellow creamy white head. Dissipates to a dusting with some really nice lacing.  S: Feels like a good bold balance of crystal and hop. Cascade seems to be leading the charge if I am not mistaken. Hop comes across like orange peel and grapefruit. There seems like there is a festive spiciness there. It's strong but subtle at the same time.  T: Starts quickly with caramel maltiness but quickly moves into a nice sharp carbonated hop sting. The hop dissipates back to a more biscuity finish but the hop plays a cameo role in the sweet and sour aftertaste. Really nicely orchestrated. Like the smell, the taste feels bold but doesn't assault you like some IPA's. Nice smooth drink.  M: Smooth light/medium bodied mouthfeel with a nice lively prickliness. So easy to down. After one, I had to have another.  D: Could the label be more holiday seasonal? Never judge a beer by it's label! This beer befuddles me. Maybe it's the dry hopping that does it but it has all of the big smell and big taste without the over aggressiveness. Hoppiness makes for a nice uplifting festive drink. It's not a show-off.

Appearance is great, nice copper-amber color with a solid finger of head that leaves excellent lacing as it drains. Nose is tons of fruity citrus bitterness, which rolls beautifully into the well-balanced flavor. Certainly a hoppy beer, but not a monster by any means, as there's a nice malt backbone in there to keep everything even. Body is thick and creamy with great carbonation. This is one I'll keep going back to, an excellent IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HitokiriNate85,4.13,"2008 bottling - Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Great packaging.  Appearance - Pours a rich amber hue that's more of a burned orangish-red under light. 1 1/2 finger light tan head. It dissipates a bit, but remains through the entire drink. Fairly carbonated. Overall, looks really inviting.  Smell - First inhale is all citrus hops. Some malt comes through on second and third. The scents combine with a deep inhale.  Taste - Sort of a spicy, zesty strong hop flavor. Really good. Hops don't taste as citrus-y as they smell. Malt flavor becomes more and more apparent in the finish as I drink more. Leaves a fairly dry hoppy aftertaste. I get a sort of floral/lighter scent in my nose after drinking. I get a bit of a warming sensation near the end of the beer. I wasn't sure what to expect(this is my first experience with Celebration), but I was worried that the hops might be overpowering. I'm glad to say I was wrong.  Mouthfeel - Not too thin, but it does feel a bit thicker as it warms. Leaves my mouth feeling coated. The coating is sort of what I'd expect a few minutes after taking cough medicine, but not in a bad way.  Drinkability - I could have a few, I think. This bottle went fairly quickly, and I was trying to savor it as much as possible(it's my only bottle). It would probably be pointless to follow this up with something that wasn't hoppy, though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ABHatter,4.33,"Very agressive pour from 12oz bottle into 16oz DFH tumbler has me running for papertowels because of the slight overpour. Inch and 1/2,light tan colored head pillows the glass leaving behind some quality lace. Color is a burnt bronze color, fairly transparent with good carbonation. S-Piney resiny hops, Orange peel, grapefruit and maybe a touch of honey from the malt at the end. Taste & mouthfeel is phenomenal, big hop profile on this beer from start to finish. Grapefruit is there as well with Sort of a soapy, piney finish leaving a delicious tangy aftertaste. Drinkability is also superb, This is certainly a sessionable beer due to the reasonable ABV especially for the colder months. I have tried this beer on several occasions within the last few years, but I never appreciated it as much as I do now. This is a top notch IPA that is a must try for anyone who enjoys great beer!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Hokies,4.63,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a nonic glass. Pours nice amber color with a massive off white head that leaves tremendous lacing on the glass.  Aroma is absolutely tremendous with a floral aroma of hops with grapefruit, citrus and pine.  A sharp taste of hops start off the flavor of grapefruit and light citrus kick through and then a slick oily pine flavor take over. It is balanced out by a nice malt taste that allows for this ipa to finish pretty clean with a nice bitterness at the end that is not overwhelming.  Not to much carbonation in the mouth which is nice and makes this beer dangerously drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JayNH,4.47,"A- A nice cloudy copper color, not much of a head.  S- An excellent floral hoppy scent.  T- I find a slightly spicy sweet maltiness balanced with a strong hoppy bite. The hop taste is very crisp and clean. I find it to have almost a grass-like taste. Malt and hops are very well balanced.  M- Slightly thick and sweet. Moderate carbonation.  D- Excellent!  This beer is nothing short of FANTASTIC. For 13 bucks for a 12pk it's a steal. This is what an IPA should taste like.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,midaszero,3.15,A - Clear red orange body with two finger for frothy tan head and excellent lacing  S - A little pine and a little citrus.

140,1904,Douglas14,4.03,"Pours a beautiful copper color with incredible clarity and an equally impressive head that leaves thick and abundant lace. The appearance is easily this beer's best aspect. The aroma is immensely and wonderfully of fresh hops! Smells like pine trees. Not a lot of malt comes through in the aroma, which is a minor knock. The taste is similar to the nose. The Celebration is packed with an extremely fresh hop character. It has a lot of pine and some resin characters that make it pretty enjoyable. The only downside is that I don't find anything overly special in the hop/IPA aspect of this beer. It's missing something that I cannot put my finger on. Anyway, wonderful beer overall though. It's definitely much better on tap than in the bottle from my experience.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dojobrewco,3.98,Excellent holiday beer. Nice copper amber pour and floral aroma. good malt balance as well.

140,1904,SerieDNo3,4.8,"Bought this at a local Whole Foods. I've been looking forward to it since last year, when I barely missed out on getting some. 12 oz. bottle poured into an American pint glass.  Appearance: Dark copper/amber color with a light head that dissipates rather quickly, but leaves excellent lacing the whole way down.  Smell: Citrus-y and piney, just as I'd expect from a West Coast IPA.  Taste: Hops. Piney and a little bit of grapefruit, with just enough malt to provide balance.  Mouthfeel: Satisfyingly crisp, with just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Eminently drinkable. ABV might be slightly high to make this a session beer, but I want to drink one after another. The hops give it a very satisfying crispness. I wish SN made this year-round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Off white finger sized head formed and was reduced to to a thin film that settled on top throughout consumption.  S- Nice bouquet of citrus hops. Smells almost like grapefruit, oranges, and lemon rinds.  T- A very nice controlled fresh hops flavor. Combination of piney and citrus taste that is not overwhelming, just very well balanced.  M- Fresh and medium to light bodied. Perfect amount of carbonation.  D- Highly drinkable. Just a very well balanced beer, yet keeps the freshness of the hop at the forefront.

140,1904,alovesupreme,4.23,"Very dark for an IPA, pours a copper, color, with a white head.  Smells more like christmas than I would expect from an IPA. Lots of hops, a little piney.  Grapefruit is the most prominent taste to my pallet. Very hoppy with a clean crisp taste.  Nice full mouthfeel, with good carbonation.  I would be happy to have a few of these, excellent lingering aftertaste. The alcohol will sneak up on you though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,rgrholmes168,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  The beer poured with a nice two finger head and has a nice orange tint to it.  I got a good whiff of hops on my first smell which seemed to grow stronger. I was surprised by this because I didn't expect this.  The beer tastes pretty good. There is a good bitterness about this beer, but it did not overpower the taste buds. There is no real aftertaste to the beer.  I would recommend this beer as a pretty decent seasonal beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,duffextracold,4.3,"Poured a nice frothy, 1 finger off white head. rich amber color.  Smells like citrussy hops, not much else.  Tastes like hops first, then a little malt sneaks in, only to shoved out of the way by more hops, then a sweet hoppy aftertaste. a little hint of wintery spices.  Medium to heavy carbonation, foamy mouthfeel.  excellent overall drinkability. this is definitely one of the more hop forward winter beers, and one of my favorites.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Jedimaster1,4.75,"2008 version served in a tulip glass.  This one is much more refined and better than the 2007 brew. Last year's selection was more hops than anything else. While it was a great brew, it was not necessarily a winter brew.  However, here comes the 2008. This brew does not fray much from the 2007, but does tastes much more maltier and sweeter. This makes it taste like a winter brew in which one is looking for that special something to keep them toasty through the winter months. This is what I think of when I see the label on the celebration ale: a cold winter's day with my favorite beer.  Great stuff and plan to get another six pack. Get yours before they are gone and you will have to wait till next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,McLovinmybeer,4.75,"This is a must have for the holiday season. Nice head, and copper color. The aroma is hoppy but more malty, surprisingly.

140,1904,bkilpatr,4.13,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a mug. 11/21/08.  Pours a clear orange-amber color with about three fingers of beige head. The head dropped slowly and left some nice lacing. Aroma is sweet toasted malt, piny hops, and spices.  Taste follows the aroma. Lots of sweet toasted caramel malt up front mixed in with some winter spice. Following that is a combination of piny and floral hops with a bit of citrus (grapefruit). Great herbal quality from the hops and a great bitterness to the finish. It's not a harsh bitterness, or overwhelming, but it's there and it finishes the taste very well.  Feel is smooth and well-carbonated with a medium body. Slightly lingering bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is very good. Each sip makes me want another, and the bitterness isn't too much.  Overall, a very good IPA.

A note of pine is also observed. Taste is quite similiar, but there is a citrus fruit noted (I would have to say grapefruit).  Mouthfeel is very bitter and 'tarty'.

Tastes VERY NICE; similar to how it smells. Sweet malt up front with a good amount of grapefruit flavor following shortly after. There's a good amount of wet bitterness at the end. Mouth feel was somewhat on the thin side, but still quite acceptable. Not a lot of carbonation. Overall, an incredible beer. I really wish the would be available daily.

140,1904,cigardave,5,"SNCA has been my fave ""hop bomb"" year in and year out. I buy a case every year and end up ""cellaring"" some. I'm drinking the '08 edition as I write this (in a local watering hole, not a favorite, since they are NOT cigar-friendly...but that's another story!).  Once again...year after year...as I'm pouring it, I notice the hops right off...Cascade and Centennial...and the taste, as usual, is to die for! Thanx Terrence (@ SN)! Thick head and a lot of lace. A GREAT cigar ale, especially if the cigar has a grassy, earth-like note.  Since most everyone, if not all, rate the current batch each year, I'd like to do something different. As mentioned, I ""cellar"" several bottles of each year's batch and conduct parallel tastings upon arrival of the new batch.  Last year we paralleled the '04 thru '07. You will notice different flavors for each year as the hops (i.e. ~ harshness) decrease with age, so the '04 was less harsh than the '05 and so on. The '04 and '05 both had an ""oxidized"" character. This is due to ""ingressive"" oxygen, which is caused by having bottle-caps versus corks (i.e. ~ allows oxygen into the bottle). The '04 and '05 had Sherry, ""winey-like"" notes, along with some ""burnt"" notes with the '04 being more so than the '05.  Re: hops...on the aromatic side, if I'm not mistaken, SN uses a 50-50 mix of Cascade & Centennial and for dry-hopping it's a mix of 70% Cascade and 30% Centennial. Primary fermentation is 3-4 days and is dry-hopped during this phase. Chinook is the bittering hop.  I'm looking forward to the first 5-year parallel this year...using up the last of the '04 and '05 batch through '08.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,nc41,4.23,"11-1-10  This is a different kinda brew than m the initial 2008 review.  My 1st one this year and IMO outstanding. Just a hint of Carmel and maybe a seasonal kinda spice at the finish makes this a little more refined than just a pure bitter bomb. A really great brew from SN, case worthy, and this year I'd bump up the taste a bit to a solid 4.5. IMO the best brew SN makes.  2008 - Tried my first one last night, and I was expecting a typical kinda spice laden winter brew. Wrong in spades! Pours a nice copper color, with a very nice head. Nose is all hops. A slightly heavier body than most IPA's, but the hop sting is fantastic, a very well balanced and conceived IPA. It's also nice the ABV is less than 7' upping the drink ability factor IMO.

140,1904,stevecee2003,4.85,"What a surprise! Wow!  Generally I do not try 'seasonal"" beers, thinking they might be inferior in some way. After all, if they are so good- then why do we not have them all year long? So now, what the Hell was I thinking?  From the pop of my 12 oz. bottle I could smell the difference. This would be one great beer. And it was. I simply must stock up for the long winter.  APP. A very nice head, with lots of lace. Always a very good sign. Could this be a nice surprise?  Smell. Wow, I can smell it already. Hops. Caramel. Being a hops man I can sense the smells coming in early. Where the Hell was I when they made this beer?  Taste. Simply sublime. The only fault I can find with Sierra Nevada is that they don't say on the packaging what a great beer you're getting. It was only by chance that I gave it a try. Clearly this should not just be a seasonal beer, but rather instead offered to the masses whenever a ""great"" beer is needed. Simply, ""Wow!""  Overall drinkability. Exceptional.

140,1904,superdedooperboy,3.93,"Poured into a tulip glass, this ale appears a bright, rich copper-amber in color, delivering a thick, creamy, slightly off-white head of foam that settles fairly slowly into a nice ring that leaves behind clones of lacing through to the finish.  The nose is a big, fruity-floral hop bouquet. Nice and inviting, but without much else presenting itself here.  Medium-bodied; somewhat thin, but not too much so. Fruity, herbaceous, bitter hop notes envelop the palate. A slightly sweet malt backbone is fairly well-hidden though present, providing a balance that isn't immediately apparent. Hop bitterness melds with a saltiness as the drink warms a bit, and the finish is salty-bitter and lingers for a fairly short time.  Overall a great American IPA, with that wonderful American hop presence, and while unoffensive and fairly tame in alcohol content, not imminently drinkable, and a bit more maltiness would be welcome in a holiday seasonal. Still, this is a superb example of its style and a solid seasonal offering from a solid American brewing icon.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Mouthfeel: medium body. No lacing developed. ABV is perfect for style.  Drinkability: medium to medium high. Really easy to drink.  This is a great IPA! Really enjoyed it!

Even when it warmed, the aroma was more subdued than I remember in previous batches. Much less of a hoppy nose than, say, the Harvest Ale series, to be sure.  Taste -A great citrus/pine hop character with a big, malty sweet backbone. A long citrusy/piney finish with yet more maltiness.  Mouthfeel -Pretty high carbonation and a medium body.  Drinkability- Excellent. I want me some more!  Comments- I will buy as much of this as I can while it's around. It's interesting- based on some forum posts, this year's batch seems to be highly variable. Some people get a malty aroma; some people note a dominant hop aroma.

140,1904,mtbbaboon,4.3,"Picked up a sixer after reading such good things about this on BA. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a copper color, slightly darker than what I'd expect with an IPA. Finger thick head that settled down quickly. Smells slightly hoppy with some citrus tones. Not a very powerful aroma compared to other IPA's I've had, but still smells pretty good. Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated, some stick, medium bodied. Oddly, the taste is a lot more robust than the aroma. Starts off slightly malty with citrus, followed up by a real nice hop taste...REAL nice. The hops and citrus linger for a bit and bitterness rounds out the taste. Drinks really well and goes down easy. This is why I love BA...I'm not a huge fan of winter seasonals and would not have bought this had I not read the commentary on BA. This an excellent IPA.

Breaded malts meld beautifully with the lively but understated floral hops. An orange marmalade sweetness with a piney earthiness make up the bulk of the flavor. A bit spicy in the finish. Well carbonated, quenching with a full bodiness. Hops leave a nice bite and a dry finish. The 2008 version is a well-balanced winner. I tried last season's on tap and couldn't taste anything more than the hops.

140,1904,lynx1245,4.43,"Appearance: A rich dark amber with yeast sediment suspended throughout. Nice looking bubbles from the carbonation add sparkle. This is a really good looking beer.  Smell: Citrus, mostly grapefruit, and big hops are what I take away first. Giving it more time and letting my mind wander more I do believe I can detect some malt.  Taste: Starts off with a sweet citrus and malty taste and finishes with BIG hops! I would expect nothing less from Sierra Nevada. Still, the hops are delicious and I wouldn't change them one bit.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied with a dry finish and good carbonation. You can really FEEL the bitterness.  Drinkability: As I review this, I'm drinking the last bottle in the 6 pack. After drinking two of these about a week ago I've literally been craving more ever since. I've never been a huge fan of really bitter beers, but this one has converted me. Cheers to you Mr. Grossman!  I think I should also mention that I used to live in Chico a few years ago and never heard a bad thing about Celebration Ale. Well, in 2005 I decided to give it a shot with my friend so we went out and bought a case to last for the weekend. Being in college and new to beer we absolutely hated it because of the huge hop presence and ended up giving half the case away to others.

As for the aroma it gives off a nice smell of hops with a hint of citrus and spices. As for the taste, this IPA has a nice medium bodied, hoppy taste going for it. The spices and citrus get all mixed up creating a nice IPA. Barely bitter at all, the beer has a great drinkability and mouthfeel to it.

Smell: Bright and hoppy, with a well-nested cave-like sour flair that suggests some English, confirmed with taste. An assured, confident, rolling malty baritone rides the belly of those soaring hops. A tractor beam that will not be denied its due.  Taste: Forward thrust of bittering hops relax their shoulders to admit a sustained malty spiral. Carbonation is palpable and boosts the quiet flood. A distinctive and extremely pleasing element of this brew is the way the sharp bittering hops & malt lay out and couple on the tongue as the music comes together.  Drinkability: One gulp begs another. Flavor that hugs the tongue both sates and awakens -- strong signature without overdubbed hops or gimmicks.

A: Pours a deep orange-copper hue with a sizable toffee colored head that pits nicely in the shape of an egg as it recedes. Retention is excellent and it lays down some serious lace on the side of the glass. A wonderful appearance.  S: Hops, fo sho. Huge pine and huge citrus aromas. I'm getting just a hint of caramel in the smell, too. Swirling and more warming reveals a sweeter spice aroma, too. Intense, complex, and pleasant--the aroma is solid.  T&M: Flavor is initially sweet with a substantial hop bite in the finish. The hop flavor is more piney/herbal than citrus, with a really solid malt backbone giving some balance and a slight sweetness midway through. The finish is long and bitter with an herbal/earthy character. Though it tastes great right now, I'll be most interested to see how it tastes as the hops mellow over the course of the year. Body is medium to full with an understated, tingling carbonation that really allows the full complexity of the flavor to develop unimpeded. Nice job.  D: For being a higher ABV, fuller bodied IPA, it actually goes down quite smoothly. I drank it in gulps, not sips, and my glass emptied quickly. SN definitely created a beer that would facilitate some Christmas cheer quite quickly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MP72,4.62,"A-deep amber to almost orange color with a thick white head that lasts for days. Superb lacing.  S-Grapefruit, orange, and I could have swore maybe some corriander and of course HOPS!  T-Hops to the nines , and a strong malt presence. Just enough bite to make you pucker and want more. This stuff is very good.  M-Medium bodied and not too much carbonation. I found it to be smooth for such a hoppy IPA.  D- Scary high,, I could drink several of these ,,, or at least I think I could. Cant say for sure how well I'd function but I am willing to find out.

Looks good, esp. the creamy head that it has  Aroma: Piney, and very hoppish. The hops dominate this aroma, not much else  Taste: HOPS. Sweet, spicy, whichever...but hops and more hops. Finishes nicely, with a good bitterness. Intense flavor on this one  Mouthfeel: Fairly clean finish, and nice feel.  Drinkability: Tastes good, good mouthfeel. Clean finish.

Aroma is full of American hops, grapefruit and pine. Bitter, but balanced. Malt is toasty and grainy. Hop flavor is again full of grapefruit and pine note. Medium bodied, not too carbonated.

Smell - Loaded with hops, great smell. Also get a grapefruit scent in there. Get some spice as well.  Taste - A very bitter beer. Huge hop presence with a bit of a spice flavor. Very awesome if you love hops.  Mouthfeel - Light bodied beer; moderate carbonation.  Drinkability - Easily drinkable if you can handle hops. Body makes it easy to down a few.

140,1904,SaucyA,4.03,"2008  A - 2 finger off white head protrudes from my Russian River pint glass. It's frothy, it's thick. The body is a glowing, clear rusty orange with ample carbonation. Ridiculously nice lacing.  S - Big hops. A definite west coast hop vibe mixed in with some other less nuanced hops. Really grapefruity. A slight caramel malt may be poking through.  T - Sweeter than bitter, it finishes with a nice hop bite. Definite balance is achieved, with the hop profile riding an awesome malty wave. Great all-around IPA... Plenty of ""C"" hops.  M - Slightly thinner body with a nice creamy, fine carbonation.  D - Killer drinkability, and a beer I'll revisit a few times this year.

140,1904,MerkinMan,3.55,"2008 version:  A: Bright copper with about a half inch of head that looks as though it will retain well  S: Spicy hops and not fruity like many Christmas beers. Reminiscent of their Pale Ale with some noticeable differences.  T: Could have probably used more malt to cut down on some of the hop soapyness. Not a bad beer at all; may benefit from some aging.  MF: Not bad. Has body, but dissipates.  D: Not at all a bad offering, but rather plain compared to other examples. Very drinkable, but does not stand out from the pack, nor does it stand out from other SN beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,LennyV,3.63,"Pours a dark brown into my La fin Du Monde tulip. Little to no head. This was poured from a mini growler, so I may have lost some carbonation.  Intense smell of hops  Tastes of hops hops and some more hops. Very bittle, little to no sweetness.  Light bodied low carbonation.  Not one of my favorite IPAs. I prefer more sweetness balanced with hops. It will please the hop lovers well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BaltimoreMike,4.85,"Being that Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is one of my all time favorites, I had to give this one a shot. I was not disappointed. Great foam, just the way I like it, not too airy and the bubbles were very uniform. A strong hoppy flavor with a bite, no bad after taste. For a strong ale it goes down pretty easy. I was a little disappointed that it was too similar to the regular pale ale. I mean if you're going to make a special brew I thought it should be much more different than what it was. It's also not for your beginner beer drinker, the flavor will be too strong for you and too bitter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,babaracas,4.25,"Sure it's the same every year, but re-reviewing for myself.  (2008) Pours a hazy copper with iffy head retention, nice lacing. Smell: pine, citrus hops, sweet with a decent amount of malt, graininess in the background. Taste: hops: grapefruit, pine, earthy, flowery, herbal are all given their due. The only thing not hops is a sweet, yeasty, toasty malt that keeps it from being one sided. Feel and drinkability are pretty spot on for an IPA. Substantial with lots of hops, nice. 11/08 (4/4/4/4/4)  (2009) Hazy red-tinged orange, lots of sediment. Smell: floral and citrus, pine, caramel sweetness beneath, SN yeast. Taste: pine, tangerine, leafy and a bit grainy, nice dose of bitterness backed by a solid caramel sweetness, yeasty. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, fluffy, prickly and drying. A tasty offering worth looking forward to each year. (4/4/4.5/4/4)  (2010) Mostly clear orange with lots of fine sediment, fluffy two finger head, half inch sticks around. Smell: floral, resinous, citrus peel, pine in that order; slight house yeast charcter, lightly bready and sweet. Taste: resiny, oily, caramel and pine, fades into a splash of grapefruit, mild graininess. Mouthfeel: damn near perfect, medium fluffy body, prickly, drying fights with residual hop oils. Exceptional. Bottled 9/24 (6 wks old). (4/4/4.5/4.5/4)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jeremyd365,4.62,"Oh my oh my! This 2008 batch poured a delightful coppery amber with a bit of light tan head. It smelled of rich, sweet hops. In the mouth it doesn't feel too thick and the bitterness can begin to be sensed. The taste isi wonderous! A crisp, hard hop bite while remaining quite sweet and piney as well. It finishes with bitter hops which leave a great flavor behind. Very drinkable and the 6.8% isn't noticable at all..at first. This is a great IPA which I think I'll be stocking up as my winter sipper of choice so far! YUM! Highly recommend!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T- Crisp fresh hop taste with a light caramel/grainy sweetness. A little more hop bitterness comes through toward the end to more or less dominate the finish.  M- Just about where an IPA should be.  D- A hoppy beer at 6.8%, yeah I can do this.  It really great to see a good hoppy beer clock in at less than 7%.

This year's pours a deep orange with some yeasty cloudiness; the head's three fingers high and leaves nice lacing down the sides -- good retention. The smell is pine with some malt and citrus. The taste starts with some biscuit notes, moving though rich malts and some diacetyls to a sharp hop bite with lots of juniper and tangelo; the alcohol is masked for at least the first few sips. It's nicely carbonated, not too overpowering, and fills the mouth well. It's all too easy to drink: you have to watch it with this one.

The nose is all kinds of hoppy, with grapefruit and tangerine notes, along with hints of spice and caramel.  The taste is also all about the hop flavors and bitterness that is really nice and sticks around just long enough. There is also some spiciness to it, but all the flavors seem to come from the hops.

Pours a nice dull orange copper color with tiny bubbles rising to a thick foamy head that lasts, slowly disappearing to a thin layer sticking to the sides of the glass. When sipped leaves a nice lacing behind.  Smell is heavy on the hops with a sweet toasted malt aroma in the background, maybe a little caramel.  taste is what I expected since it's one of my favorite seasonal beers. Light toasted malt on the tip of the tounge, with a nice hop bite hitting in the back of the mouth and throat. Slight alcohol finish also.  Full bodied beer, like a maltier IPA. Very smooth.  Drinkability I would have to say is pretty darn good. Can drink plenty of these on cold Cleveland winter nights.  Will be comparing soon side by side with the 2007.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,FordBrewing,3.81,"12 oz bottle 2008  Amber color that pours an average off-white head. If served too cold it diminishes quickly. Body is closer to cloudy but not unappealing. Nice malt aroma with scents of grain, straw, and a roasted almost nutty smell. The hops bring hints of pine and spruce. This definitely smells like a ""winter"" beer.  It is medium bodied and has average carbonation. The taste lasts a long time, almost too long, and sits right on the back corners of the tongue well after your last sip.  This celebration ale has great aroma but is very bitter, even for an IPA. This is a good attempt at a Winter Ale that comes across as an IPA in disguise, but its almost as if it tries to be something that its not. Better than last year, but not great.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The nose is hoppy still, nothing foul going on here. The hop character yes has mellowed somewhat in the taste, but its still got plenty of bite. The spices have died down to a balancing,mild intensity and the malt profile is way higher than i remember it being. The nutmeg and cinnamon are intensified on the finish by loads of spicy hops. the hops live on indeed!! reminds me more of a winter beer now actually. Medium bodied and very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Brillig,4.33,"2008 Version, bottle.  I've been trying this beer each of the last three years. I found 2006 to be exceptional, 2007 to be a bit of a let down, and now the 2008 version is back to form.  Pours a dark coppery brown with a nice head. In fact, if you serve this at the correct temperature (an important thing for everything about this beer) and not refrigerator temperature, it will keep a foamy head until long after you've finished drinking.  Taste is great strong malty base with nice hops overtones (subtle by Sierra Nevada standards). Medium mouthfeel complements the flavor nicely.  Drink this beer at cellar temperature and it will be one of the highlights of the season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A little less citrus/grapefruit aroma from the '07, more of a hoppy aroma. Taste is not too strong with hops,some citrus/grapefruit present.

140,1904,2LBrew,4.11,"I had two different bottles of this years release from two different six packs.  The appearance of this beer as I poured it into my Sierra Nevada (Chico baby!!!) logo pint glass was a nice amber with a creamy finger and a half head and good lacing on the glass.  The smell was a bit of a disappointment from what I had remembered in years past. The spicyness wasn't as prevalent but the hops were definitely there.  What was lacking in the smell department was more than made up in the taste. I love this beer and look forward to this time of year when it is released. The hoppy bitterness seemed to be toned down a bit and a bit of citrus.  The mouthfeel was good, not overbearing and not lacking. I could defintely taste the beer when I was done with it, which was not a bad thing.  The drinkability is good and does not feel like a close to 7% beer. I definitely could drink a few of these in a night and have a great evening.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The taste follows the same suit, a very bitter big hop flavor up front that bites at the tongue, then finishes with an easier malt flavor in the background. Mouth wasn't so pleasent with the hop bite, and drinkability wouldn't have lasted long, I did not want another.

However, the bitterness is not overpowering. Nicely done Sierra.  Mouthfeel is light. Not heavy. I do wish the flavor would linger a little longer.

Citrus and tobacco, notes of grapefruit being particularly strong.

Hops fans will be lining the trunk with cases this year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,hdofu,4,"2008 Bottle. This is one bitter beer, copper in color with thick foam on top. Beer smells strong of hops and pine needles. The beer tastes piney, a bit citrusy and fairly maltl.ke. The mouthfeel is fairly sudsy. Overall I'd say its fairly drinkable for a bitter beer and a quaility beer for those who enjoy bitters.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Fatduck,4.2,"Crisp clear coppery brown, with a pillow soft head that lasts. Smells like hops, citrus and pine, tastes the same, which is good, its a damn fine IPA. Light and crisp on the tongue and its not a hard thing to drink several in a sitting, great drinkability.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,oriolesfan4,4.44,"Never got a chance to try this one last year so I bought a 12'er right when it came out this year and I'm glad I did. ($14.99/12)  One of the most beautiful beers I've seen in a glass... a huge fluffy head with a light copper-ish color, tons of ascending bubbles which just scream out freshness/deliciousness.  Taste is hop filled and bitter, but the hops seem to me a bit subdued more than the usual IPA. I catch more of a fruity vibe to it than the basic IPA and the bitterness seems to last through the swallow (in a good way). I'm finding this beer hard to review because the beer is almost too good to savor at all. Great work SA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HalfFull,3.53,"Pours a nice orange amber typical of the Sierra Ale family, and with a half inch of off white head. A bit cloudy in appearance, or perhaps hazy is a better word, quite welcoming. Head dissipates in a few minutes and shows brief lacing.  A bit of earthen hops on the nose, some resinous pine and just a hint of subtle cinnamon spice.  Taste is smooth with a slight bitterness, yet the malt structure balances nicely. Notes of cinnamon on the finish. The carbonation does dissipate too quickly in my opinion, even with a slow pour, and thus yields a slightly viscous feel to the brew in the second half even as the hop notes open up.  Similar to SNPA in many ways but with a bit more maltiness and a heavier body. I see this as a nice fortified version of their Pale Ale but it doesn't stand out in the IPA realm.  Note: 2008 Release....",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,John_M,4.13,"On tap at Max's and Mahaffey's last night. The beer seemed a bit fresher at Mahaffey's (which is to be expected - the owner loves the stuff and I think they blow through kegs pretty quickly).  The beer pours the expected copper orange color with very good head retention and incredible sticky lacing. This is the way all IPA's should look. On the palate I get a very nice intermix of hoppy citrus, set off with some nice underlying malt. The beer smells attractive. On the palate this beer is just delicious (as it always is). It's medium bodied and decidedly on the hoppy side, but with enough malt to easily balance the hop bill. The beer actually has a fairly light mouthfeel, and is not the least bit heavy or tiring to drink.  Have been drinking this beer for years now; it's a perennial favorite I have to say. While my taste in beer has changed over the years, this beer continues to delight. An absolute classic from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,KeefD,4.51,"Copper orange with dense rocky head and tons of fine particulates floating around. I love unfiltered IPAs and this looks like the best of em. The lacing on this thing is incredible as it quickly leaves my glass. Did I really drink this much in only a few minutes?? Nice citrusy aroma, orange, lemonpeel, grapefruit, pine. It has all you need, but there's always room for more. Very nice caramel flavor with citrus hop blast that makes me pucker up. Grapefruit and pine are present, which I like, good use of caramel malts, semisweet at first, but dry on the finish. It's pretty much everything you want and need out of an IPA. Creamy, smooth, yumm. Balanced and delicious. Probably the most drinkable IPA I've come across. Why is this not year round??? Well done SN.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Clydesdale,4.33,"A: Pours a translucent copper color with a nice, creamy white head with great retention and nice lacing. Very attractive, like most other SN offerings.  S: Lots of hops, they bring to mind grapefruit. Some biscuity malts as well. Notes of pine and tart citrus.  T: Big, big hops. Piney, citrusy, and assertive. Malts are present, with biscuity and vaguely caramel touches. Hints of spice are noticeable at the finish, perhaps some cinnamon.  M: Tight, tingly carbonation. Medium to somewhat light body with a dry finish. A bit thinner than you might expect.  D: It's not the most balanced brew around, but it's very very tasty. Certainly drinkable despite the ABV. It's a festive, aggressive holiday IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,erikm25,4.08,"A: Pours a sharp looking balance of shiny copper coloring and crisp amber tinting. Aggressive pour yields a bubble capped mountain of off white pillowing fluff. Retention is great. Lacing is splattered up and down the glass.  S: Pine, floral, and candy cane aromas. The hops is in the forefront but still a honey sweet and peppered smell in the back. Pineapple and peach smothered in pine needles and sweeteners. Fresh and merry.  T: Straight and solid hops. Grapefruit and citrus sprinkle their tingles across the tongue. A little bit of malt helps to round things out. Slight cinnamon and caramel adds to a subtle sweetness. Overall, this is a nice hop treat with just a perfect splash of spice in the finish.  M: Creamy body and decent carbonation.  D: Night before Halloween is a celebration in and of itself. As previously established, hundreds of times over, this is an amazingly drinkable beer. Great anytime but especially from All Hallow's Eve through New Years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,thespaceman,4.3,"2008 Edition, Served from bottle, poured into pint glass:  Appearance: Nice golden/amber color, not too dark at all, with a minimal head that dissapeared pretty quickly. Nice retention and good lacing as well.  Smell: Spices is what comes to mind. Good malt character and nice florals. Caramel, nutmeg, & fruit really pop on the hops. Very welcoming.  Taste: Again, a good spice kick in the end, this one has alot of good characteristic, it's malty yet not over-malted, very flavorful with a nice bitterness in the end. Grapefruit pops out HUGE here, an excellent addition to this. Taste similar to the notes of a Samuel Adams Boston Lager but with the spiciness doing the work, an excellent tasting beer.  Mouthfeel: Pretty carbonated, creamy, yet light on the palette.  Drinkability: I can drink these till the cows come home. I didn't think I'd be as impressed as I was but I am, a great tasting beer from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kinger,3.38,"Tasty brew, but I'm not sure why this recipe would be their winter seasonal. Caught somewhere between a strong ale and an IPA this one has a great medium hop profile, but a generous amount of additional malts could take this through the roof. Mild bitterness to the nose, floral and light fruits backed with some light caramel malt. Copper pour with an amber/red tint, medium head and lacing. Good drinkability but it's thin. Spicy taste with a great hop balance. This warms the body and mellows the mind, it's a nice drink but I was expecting more complexity.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,philipquarles,3.78,"Pours clear copper with a resilient, thick tan head that leaves great lacing.  Smells of grapefruit and citrus; the hops are strong with this one. Some sweet malt notes are also evident, but masked by the citric hops. The grapefruit is less apparent in the taste, which is more pure hop bitterness. Some piney notes, backed up by a bit of biscuity malt.  Overall, a nice IPA, but the bitterness/lack of malty notes leaves balance a bit lacking.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BretSikkink,4.3,"Celebration comes from the tap sporting a tan cap over a burnished orange-brown body. Strong aromas and flavors of piney, citric hops - smooth, easy drinking with a huge hop presence that manages to avoid over bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little below the supremacy of the other characteristics, but the overall experience is wonderful.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,KALIKGOLD,3.87,"I poured this into a pilsner glass pretty fast, the head was a very nice light tan color about 3 fingers. I immediately smelled a great aroma of grapefruit and other citrus. It also taste a bit like grapefruit. The lacing was minimal. There is a nice balance of flavor and carbonation, I dont really like IPA's but could drink this all night for some reason. It is strong but not overdone. Overall I think its a great american IPA and I would purchase it again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,abecall98,4.33,"Purchased a 12-pack recently and had it in the fridge. Poured it into my personalized mug with my name on it, and am sitting here at my computer, consuming the ale.  A - Poured a beautiful head, and left a nice amberish tint, looks great.  S - Smells of hops and christmas - wonderful  T - Very light for an IPA, but still rather intense. The flavor is very powerful, tastes like the regular Pale Ale with an added hoppy bite.  M - Not as carbonated as the Pale Ale, but the carbonation is there. The mouthfeel is pleasant, and aids this beer in going down smoothly.  D - Drinkable - Hell yes! For it's ABV, this beer is session able beyond belief. The taste leaves that aftertaste of hops making you want more.  Conclusion - Buy this beer. It's a wonderful offering of the beer gods, and like we all know, Sierra Nevada doesn't disappoint, and this years Celebration Ale, is proof of that statement.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Reino,4.45,"2008 Celebration Ale  Appearance- Pours a beautiful mahogany base with light caramel highlights all over the place. I gave it kind of a pussy pour, which only produced one and a half fingers, but undoubtedly, a more vigorous pour would have produced a kickass head. The head gives way fairly quickly, but a nice thin layer of tight bubbles settle on top for the whole ride. This beer does a very nice job of lacing my goblet all the way down to the bottom.  Smell- The aroma starts with loads of sweet fruity hops. Sugar coated grapefruit, pineapple, and mandarin orange. The sweetness didn't stay long, though. In almost an instant, the hops take a turn to pine town. Spicy pine and grapefruit rind take the lead and hold it. There is probably some light malt aromas in there, but my nose is keyed in on the delicious pine, and there's plenty of it.  Taste- Bitter hops, piny hops, and fruit rinds (grapefruit, and orange) jump out first. That flash of sweetness I got in the nose is pretty much nonexistent in the taste. There is a bit of grapefruit juice, but it is surrounded by bitterness. There is a flash of biscuity malts in the middle that do a great job of breaking up the bitterness that comes right back in the finish. SN didn't pussy out and overly ""balance"" this IPA. They threw in just enough malts to keep things fresh, and then hammered home the delicious bitterness. SN seems to have hop profiles down to a T in their IPAs.  Mouthfeel- On the lower end of medium carbonation, this beer starts out creamy and chewy in your mouth, and then takes a turn towards watery on the finish. I can't decide if that's a good or bad thing. It's a bit drying on the tongue, but not so bad that it makes you want to stop after one...  Drinkability- I could sit down with a sixer of this during the Holidays and forget that I'm hanging around a bunch of insane relatives. I've had Celebration with age on it, and it just doesn't do it justice, in my opinion. Drink it fresh, and drink a lot of it. This is a wonderful, drinkable, affordable IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,djeucalyptus,4.13,"Poured a fresh 12oz bottle of '08 celebration into a goblet.  a. A golden amber body with a thick and full off-white head leaving behind some very nice lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass. This looks lighter than past celebrations, although it may just be my imagination?  s. Hops. Floral hops, citrus hops, and just a hint of pine. Some malts and caramels peek through the hopping, but just barely, even when warmed slightly.  t. Definitely hops. Granted, this is pretty fresh, but wow - hops. There's a definite floral and citrus hop presence, with some definite trailing hop bitterness. Caramel and roasted malts peek through ever so slightly, but at this point in it's life, the hops are pretty much the focal point.  m. Smooth and creamy, a touch light, but I wouldn't go as far as to say watery. There's an almost numbing bitterness from the hop presence, which is nice, but again, caught my slightly off guard.  d. Definitely drinkable... and the brew hides the abv fairly well. I could easily session this one. Worth a shot if you haven't before. This one, while a winter seasonal, definitely reminds you that it's an IPA more than anything else. which can be a nice change from the spices and elves.  It seems a bit less malty and a bit lighter in color than previous years, althought the color could be attributed to my weak memory, and the malt may just be drowned out by the incredible hop power that this bottle has fresh. I'm not sure I've had the pleasure of having one quite this fresh in years past.

Knowing that it wasn't I showed him the bottle with the '07 label. He then gave me a discount because it wasn't new.. Fine by me, this stuff ages nicely.  this is my favorite of the Sierra Family.

The hop resins pack a bit of a bite at first with high bitterness, but it quickly settles down to produce a wonderful taste. Alcohol is nowhere to be found and the mouthfeel is well balanced. Very drinkable. I really have no qualms with Celebration, other than its misleading holiday label and its unwillingness to venture away from the norms of IPAs in taste. It is, however, a textbook example of the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

From the Christmas-ey label and the 2007 date on the bottle I figured it was more than a few months old. I was also expecting some type of spiced holiday ale or winter warmer. It poured a slightly hazy copper with a two finger head.  Smells of citrusy hops, oranges, pale malt.  Taste follows the smell pretty well. Initially there's a malty sweetness then a decent hop presence comes in and takes over while keeping the malt in the background.  This one was sort of a hoppy step above a pale ale but not to the IPA level. Good brew, however the winter time label threw me off.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A bit watery in the final gulps,and that was the only flaw.  Notes: The well masked alcohol made up for some water in the finish. Balance was off just a bit,but that was not enough to stop this beer.

Smell: Floral West coast hops (Chinook bittering, Cascade & Centennial finishing & dry) and sweet, bready malt (two-row pale & English Caramel).  Taste: Much of the same, though not as sweet as aroma. I love the hop profile, and the malt is spot on for a West coast IPA. I love that it's not that sweet, and I love the hop bitterness and flavor. I love this beer!  Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Mouthfeel is thick, and coupled w/ the good drinkability and the rest of the brew's characteristics, it's great.  I love this beer.

140,1904,joshwlt,4.03,"Reviewed this more as a ""winter warmer"". 06 vintage tasted next to an 06 vintage of Anchor's winter warmer - Our special ale.  Celebration pours a hazy orange-amber color. After some vigorous shaking of the bottle a sticky one inch off-white head lasts and leaves its trail. Smells of malt sweetness (some sugary fruit (apple) and caramel), slightly boozy peppery spice, and a light grapefruit and even slighter soapy hop presence still lingers; likely subdued over two years of aging. An effervescent, tasty, ever-present, lingering, spicy hop profile hits the palate first, though certainly not overwhelming. No real bitterness just a spiciness that is tamer than your average pale ale, but is fun and warming. I was expecting some heavy malt; but really just a light, almost fruity sweetness exists -- notes of juicy apple, and toffee. This beer is not overly complex only a few dominant flavors exist, but it is fun and fits the winter warmer style nicely. Easy to drink, no alcohol is recognized on the palate, and no off flavors.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Hops overpower the malts, leaving it a little unbalanced. Bitter aftertaste that hangs around.  D: The 6.8 alcohol is well hidden but noticed in the aftertaste.

A little citrus-y.  Taste: As the scent indicates, this is hoppy but not overwhelmingly so. Upfront taste is almost sweet. Goes down a little rough, and the bitterness only grows after you swallow it.  Mouthfeel: Kind of watery, and a little thinner than the smell or taste would indicate.  Drinkability: Given the alcohol, this is pretty easy to drink. Still, the lingering bitterness can become a little overwhelming after a few.

The lacing was aggressive and encompassing.  It smells like an IPA should. Meaty and full of hop aroma. Good citrus notes like grapefruit ring through.  The taste was smooth and creamy. Initial maltiness soothes you and they slaps you in the face with lovely American hops. It is a little sugary and bitter in the same note.

Still has great lacing and head, not that many bubbles (maybe due to the suspended particles getting in the way?) in my Duvel glass, though.  Aroma was fantastic. Lots of sticky sweet fruit .. mainly cherries come to mind, cotton candy, some herbalness, and lots of pine cone.  Taste is almost on par with a fresher bottle, just with more hop astringency aftertaste. Lots of grapefruit, pine, typical IPA flavors. Leaves my tongue feeling a bit dry at the end. This one is almost going into double IPA actually with the sweetness.  The astringency from the hops deteriorating kinda take away from the mouthfeel and drinkability here.

Aroma Delicious hops are there, but what really surprised me about this beer was the really delectable aromas of malts. Such a rich and balanced smell.  Taste & Mouthfeel This is up there with some of the most impressive and tasty beers from the get-go. It has a luscious full-bodied mouthfeel without being too heavy, and it also has a perfect level of carbonation. The hops are really present and in a great way, but the malts are also coming through balancing the whole thing out exceptionally. Again, I'm very surprised and pleased by the malt side of this beer.  Overall This beer really made an impression on me and it far exceeded the hype. If it weren't for the semi-high ABV, I would have easily put three away the first night I had this. I'm really, really pleased with this and will certainly buy it every season from now on.  Update: 2007 Version  It's still such a good beer, but I liked the 2006 version better. And that's strange because 2006 was considered by many to be an off year. But I think it had a better malt profile to it than the '07's. Still a very drinkable and well crafted IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Proteus93,4.23,"Being that this is the 2007, and it's only now March, this is still fresh as can be. I didn't find another one to try aging:  A: A deep, bronzing tone of amber. The head on this one is magificantly sticky and creamy, and leaves a very liberal sheet even after receding.  S: Citrus hops with a floral touch, and a malty undertone which comes out just enough to make for a nice touch.  T + M: A similar profile to the aroma. A note of toasty + sweet maltiness on the front, until the rush of hops overtake it with a floral and citrus flavour. Nothing too intense, but a nice flavour that lingers well through the finish. Part of that is thanks to the fuller body of the brew, leaving a slick coating over the mouth.  D: Something I'd like to have another of, but there was only one available where I was. Might need to look into what is still around at other locations, and perhaps try cellaring a couple.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Gtreid,3.8,"This is the last Celebration Ale I have for this year, I've had this particular beer now for about 4 months. Poured into a pub glass. Very nice reddish tan color with one finger of sandy colored head, good retention and lacing. Smells of piney hops, very appropriate for a holiday seasonal. The taste was just as expected for a traditional American IPA, malty up front with a hoppy dry finish. Very drinkable at 6.8% ABV, a good saesonal selection. Cheers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bloberglawp,4.5,"Pours light cooper, frothy head, laces nicely. Solid aroma of delicate herbal and pithy citrusy hops and sierra nevada's house yeast strain.  Straightfoward flavor. Solid malt/hop balance, very good representation of a American IPA, export to Canada please!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,maddogruss,4.17,"My friend hooked me up with a bottle of this beer.  A: Pours a nice, golden body with a silky, white head with excellent retention and lacing along the sides of the glass until the finish.  S: A nice, hoppy citrus smell with grapefruit undertones. Nice smell for an IPA.  T: A really hoppy taste in the beginning that mellows out. Citrus/grapefruit undertones come out later to balance the hop taste very well.  M: A nice, smooth mouthfeel that is very welcoming in the palette.  D: A very drinkable beer. Excellent combination of smooth mouthfeel and balanced taste makes this an IPA that is easy to drink and enjoy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Sycodrummer,4.13,"Poured from the stubby 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass the beer was a bright ruby color with lots of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass to feed a one finger head. The head is thick and nearly pure white and it sticks around throughout the sample with some decent lacing as well.  The nose is piney and hoppy with doughy and bready undertones.  The hops hit the palate first and coat the tounge with a thick blanket of bitternes that's very balanced and not overly agressive. A drying efffect from the hoppiness is balanced with a nice semi-frim malty base that shines through with a doughy character. Hops have a slight edge on the balance and the prickly carbonation helps to clear that palate with each sip.  Medium body with ample carbonation.  This is always a steady and sound choice for winter seasonals. Balance is quite good, but the hops make enough of a presence to intimate its style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,btuthill,3.93,"poured near-brown from 12 oz. bottle. smell is nice, citrusy hops are pleasant. the alcohol is perhaps too noticeable in the palate, but its a nice hop/malt balance. because of the strong taste, it may not be appealing past the first couple, but it really is a wonderful tasting beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Walken,4.45,"Sierra Nevada: Celebration Ale, IPA (2007) (Tasted 03/20/08) 12 oz. Bottle: Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours deep gold with amber highlights, big fluffy white head that leaves little patches of lace. Odor: Clean tangerine & grapefruit hop aroma with some resiny pine in the background, some caramel as well. Consistency: Medium body, clean with a bit of hop oil slickness. Moderate carbonation. Taste: Big, aggressive herbal hop bitterness from the get go. Caramel & bread enter the picture, not so much balancing the bitterness but definitely taking the edge off & complimenting it. Hop flavor is mild, sweet grapefruit & spice notes. Finishes with hop oils coating the palate, herbal flavors & residual bready malt.  Damn...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Nipitato,4.1,"Purchased a bottle at Julio's in Westborough, MA.  A:Reddish copper hue with very good clarity.  S: A big juicy grapefruit hop aroma is the largest presence. Some light boozy alcohol aroma. Sweet biscuit malt underscores.  T: Resiny, grapefruit hop flavor dominates. Some sweet malt touches through. Dry finish with lingering bitterness. A touch of alcohol flavor.  MF: Medium body. Dry. Highly carbonated.  D: A highly drinkable IPA. A different take on winter/holiday ales, which tend to go the spicy, old, or barleywine route. Good stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,travloh,3.97,"Poured into a standard pub glass, temp is 58 F.  Color is like a burnt sienna. Cloudy appearance, and with a shift to the better light I notice suspended what-nots floating consistently throughout. Very small, like the head of a pin and translucent. Nice head forms, and it dissipates to a 1/4 inch shortly, but after that it is around for the duration. Good lacing.  Taste is slightly hoppy, also a little burning aftertaste of alcohol...very faint though. Has an aftertaste but it is not unpleasant or overpowering.  Overall drinkability is good. I have always had a good opinion of Sierra Nevada, for 12-13 yrs. I think this stuff is another solid offering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ckeegan04,4.53,2007 bottle into mug.  A - Amber color with excellent head and lacing. Good retention.  S - Hops. Nice fresh citrusy hops. Could also pick up some spice and a hint of the alcohol.  T - Everything it was hyped to be. Great bitterness and some nice toasty malts as well.  M/D - Very smooth and well balanced. Hits you with all the right tastes in the right sequence. Just top notch.  I didnt learn of the wonders of the SN Celebration until late this winter and by then I couldnt find it anywhere in Nashville. Figured I would just have to wait until next year but I ended up in California last week and stumbled across a shop that had some around. Lucky me. One of the best beers I have had.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cvstrickland,4.23,"12 oz bottle, unceremoniously dumped into a seidel mug; four fingers of head last quite a little while...  Excellent cranberry-orange color; copious creamy beige, chunky, tightly-bubbled head that retains at a finger or so throughout the drink with foamy, tasty, creamy chunks lasting-- with outstanding, solid, sticky lacing coating the mug throughout.  Smell is hoppy, but sweetly malty-- pleasantly evergreeny, with a whiff of tangy citrus.  Taste is lightly brown-malty sweet with dark caramel and a significant, aromatic mouthful of fruity, florally-bitter hops. The finish is clean and a little dry; smooth on the palate with a nice hop bite at the finish. Perfect carbonation to make it lively and infinitely drinkable.  A superb seasonal beer I religiously stock my fridge with when it's offered.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,atigerlife,4.08,"Pours a slightly dark golden-orange color. Fluffy white head that has excellent lasting power. Good lacing. Very nice to look at.  Aroma is hops. Some grass and citrus in there as well.  Taste is hops, first and foremost. Some floral, malts and a nice grapefruit flavor comes through.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry and nicely cleansing. Very enjoyable.  Overall, this is a nice beer. Very drinkable and sessionable. Wish I had more in my fridge!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,AKBelgianBeast,4.35,"Now this is fantastic session beer. Pours a murky brown/orange with great white head that lingers like a fart in a phone booth. good lace. Nose is west coast hops. Taste follows, but the impressive part here is the balance. The malts are as present here as the hops, while the hops are still very much in yer face. Awesome flavor, and great hearty yet drinkable flavor. Mouthfeel is great here, and drinkability is fantastic. A wonderful session beer, and one that is a defenite go to.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Jmamay22,3.98,"I know I'm a bit late to review this one and the hops are more dominant when immediately fresh, but this is a very balanced IPA even fresh that maintains its profile into late winter.  Pours a slightly hazy amber orange and features an off white head with a shade of pumpkin coloring. Nice thick rings of lacing that shows the history of each sip.  Smells more balance than when fresh off the truck, but the Cascade hops are evident. Very balanced and features a caramel biscuity nose that is undeniably Celebration.  Taste is similar to the nose, but more complex. The hops are front and center, but midway through the caramel biuscuits help mellow things out. Finishes with a piney citrus puckering effect.  Mouthfeel is medium, but the carbonation gives off a poor impression and it is less lively than I would have hoped. Drinkability is very high for the style and abv, which can be attributed to the beer being well balanced. This isn't a pure hop fix as other IPAs are, but serves as a refreshing and enjoyable winter respite from the over the top and in your face big beers found during these colder months.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,fitzy84,3.41,"The drink had a blood-red amber appearance with great lacing. Sharp malts and spices were sensed as the main aromas from this one. It overall had a pretty malty taste, but there was a sourish-bitter aftertaste to it that seemed off. A great carbonation helps this drink and gives it a good punch. However, that bitterness cannot be masked by the mouthfeel, so its drinkability is hindered.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MrMonkey,4.25,"Pours a deep, reddish amber with orange highlights with a three-finger creamy head that fades slowly to about 1/4"" and leaves great lacing.  Aromas of floral hops and citrus fruit (grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest) with a slight grassy/grainy quality. Solid malt background, but the hops really dominate.  Taste is grainy, bready malts up front, followed by the floral, citrus hops. There's a slight bite on the tongue. Moderate bitterness, with a clean, dry finish.  Medium-bodied mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation. Real smooth. Bitterness keeps it dry without making your mouth pucker.  Wonderfully drinkable. I can see myself drinking through the cases I have pretty quickly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,rye726,4.3,2006  Amber brown with a very nice light tan head.  Aroma has lots of spicy herbal hops but also has a comples sweetness to it. Sents of ripe fruits and dark candy.  Taste is very complex and has quite the flavor profile. Goes from bitter to buttery sweet and finishes with another kick.  Medium body with ample fizz. A very delicios beer indeed. Ages well.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,toolbrew,4.45,"It's always a joyous time of year when this seasonal is released. Definately one of Sierra Nevada's best brews.  The appearance is great. A nice clear, coppery-brown color and a fine white head. Some lacing.  Smell is incredible! Very hoppy, citrus, maybe a hint of a woodsy scent.  Taste...whew! Definately hoppy! I love the taste of this beer and the finish is so smooth. Again that hoppy-citrus sensation.  Light body and flows around the mouth very well.  I could easily drink a few of these. The higher ABV isn't too noticeable in the taste but it can be felt in the body.  Great beer. I try to hold on to a few until the next batch comes out. Actually I held onto one from 2005 and drank it recently. Still tasted great. Although some years are better than other years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DrDogbeer,3.85,"On tap into a shaker pint glass. Very nice amber/ red color with nice cream colored head. Good aroma of fruity/ tangy hops. Not what I expected. It does not have the look of a ipa, rather a maltier beer. The malt comes out after the first couple of sips, after the bitter hop flavor dies down a bit. Great medium bodied beer. Have had them for probably the last 6 or 7 winters and finally really appreciating this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,charlzm,3.42,"Bottled, consumed on 12/04/07.  Amber, plenty of carbonation. Nice white head that didn't fade too fast or last too long.  Aroma of grapefruit hops.  Some nutty malt on the palate as the astringent beer enters the mouth, but hops steamroll the malt flavor almost immediately and provide a lasting, bitter finish.  If you don't understand the appeal of hoppy beers, this one will not be the one to explain it to you.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jeremy13586,4.33,"Just stumbled upon a couple of bottles sitting in my closet that were leftover from a case I got in September. It poured a deep amber with a fluffy white head that was about 1/2 inch. It dissolved rather quickly, leaving behind a film of bubbles on the side and a thin layer on top the brew (which remained as I finished the last drops). A nice spiciness hits the nose at first, followed by some nice floral notes. Something was a bit off in the smell, though. The hops may have started degrading since this beer is about 5+ months old. It has held up rather well, though. Bitter spiciness hits the tounge with the first sip, followed by a nice malty back bone. It ends with some nice alcoholic warmth. Nice and bubbly with a medium body and a crisp finish. The SNPA is one of my go-to beers, and I really did grow to love this one as well during the holiday season. I look very forward to 2008's offering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,josiahschlender,4.21,"I never knew even what style Celebration was until I looked it up here on BA. Unfortunately, that was after most of it sold out this holiday season. After snagging one hanging around late I won't make that mistake next holiday season.  Great looks all around, worth a second glance. The head is tenacious, leaving a good amount of lacing. The froth has a copper tinge from the beautiful clear, orange and copper body.  Aromatic spicy, citrus hops dominate the nose. They're abundant and still smell fresh. I also detect some sweet caramel malt and just a bit of floral/fruitiness that I'm not sure the origin of.  The hops are clear and present, with adequate bittering. Nothing overpowering, but they don't let you forget Celebration is an IPA. Finish is long, ending with chewy, bready malts and lemon-peel bitterness. Mouthfeel is excellent, very smooth and creamy. For the amount of hops, this beer disappears surprisingly quickly and easily.  Props to SN for putting out a different seasonal to keep things interesting for the holidays! I love how they get out very quality brews at very reasonable prices. One of the factors that makes this a very drinkable brew. Keep them coming!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Maudite,3.67,"Another Sierra Nevada beer....  A- It's a beautiful copper-brown/orange-red... little head presence which surprised me (I had two in a row to be sure), though what was there was a froth of nutmeg speckled white, like a small amount of latté foam. Body was a pleasing sight.  S- As I expected, hops, hops, hops. Not a bad thing, just not what one would expect from a winter-themed beer. It is what one would expect from any sierra beer, especially an AIPA. Some pungent tang, a bit like sour grapefruit (not ruby red), perfumey... reminded me of citrus cleansers, in a good way. lemon rind/orange oil...  T- I find it unbalanced. Alot of hops (the Sierra signature), but not necessarily the right increments. I love hops, but find this to be confused. Not a horrible beer, but could be improved upon... Just a shade darker than the pale ale. More malt would strike a slight balance, offset some of the hop, give more dimension. Overall, unimpressed by a seemingly uninspired ale.  M- Fills the gills. The hops really grab the tongue and the cheeks. High acidity, medium carbonation. Punchy, angsty. I like this feeling more than this taste. This is the part where the hops are appreciated. Almost astringent...  D- Decent beer, moderate ABV... I had two, not sure I would have another. If the recipe was revamped, I could go for it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,DaveUK,3.7,"Appearance - Slightly hazy, dirty, orange, brown red.  Aroma - Pungent grapefruit and citrus notes from the cascade hops, leading to perfumy and floral appearances.  Taste - Sharp and pronounced bitterness, grapefruit and citrus immediately present. Juicy malt and red fruits detectable after several sips.  Mouthfeel - Powerfully bitter with a high acidity. Alcohol totally hidden by the hop blast. Medium to light feel.  Overall - An in your face, well hopped APA. Superb and appealing cascade lead, hop blast. Contrary to the comments, I find this beer quite unbalanced, not enough malt and body to balance the hops. I prefer the anniversary ale as an APA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Lots of lacing all the way down the glass.  S-Sharp pine dominates the scent. deep in the background is a relaxing caramel malt tone.  T-Upfront is a hefty amount of cool piny hops with a subtle malt undertone. The piny hop flavor intensifies for the finish. Left to linger is a low residual bitterness and some piny hop flavor. The flavor reminds me of a cold winter day.  M- Medium to high carbonation and medium weight body. Decent-but nothing special about it.  D-This is a very nice and refreshing IPA. It doesn't ""wow"" me-as this year's Anniversary Ale did...but its still pretty darn good. Nice offering by Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Very aromatic with the sweet scent of pine and hops.  This one hits the taste buds immediately, some sweet malts, but mostly hops. Definitely bitter, with the hops lasting through to the finish.

M - Medium body with little prickles of CO2.  D - I could have several of these but after that I think all the hops would get to me...but that is just me.

Small, frothy, off-white head that diminishes quickly like most Sierra Nevada products that I have had in the past. Aroma is very pleasent with hopps and grapefruit and a molasses undertone. Also smell a little hint of apple. Flavor starts sweet and then goes to the bitter IPA taste that you either love or hate. The finish lasts a long long time.

140,1904,kleffman,4.32,"Ah how I love this Sierra Seasonal IPA. Ok, I'm getting ahead of myself.  Pours a golden amber with a nice head and moderate carbonation level.  Hops dominate the nose with citrus and floral aromas similar to their regular pale ale, but much more in your face. I love the hop combinations they use in this ale.  Taste is a citrus hop flavor on top of a sweet malt base making for a very well balanced and wonderful IPA. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the flavor here. Not super bitter, but just enough to help the balance.  Mouthfeel is great and is high on drinkability for me. I could easily get through a few of these.  If you like Cascade hops and Sierra beers in general you will probably love this winter seasonal. This years batch was especially fantastic, but maybe that's just because I missed out on last year.

Smell: Aroma of spices, sour notes and hops.  Taste: The spices make a noticeable appearance on the palate. Seems to have a dash of nutmeg and caramelized notes. Hops are prevalent and malt background is there.  Mouthfeel: Has a definite bite to it with the carbonation and spices.  Drinkability: This is a beer that should be enjoyed in small doses. More than a couple of these and your palate is numbed, but on the plus side, this is a good beer to toast a celebration with.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - Piney, citrus hops, with a nice balance of spice abound.  T - YUM, Hoppy and malty with the perfect balance of creaminess. God I love this beer.  M - Medium bodied with a full fell on the tongue. Very warming with a nice hop finish.  D - Very drinkable beer and much recommended from a growler. I finished the growler the same night as I opened it; just keep that in mind.

140,1904,bark,4.48,"The colour is deep brown red; the very high pale beige head is airy. It sinks slowly into a very fine uneven two finger head, leaving lots of lacing.  The smell is as luxury as the looks: Deep matured fruity dry-bitter notes of hops are balanced by sweet notes of caramel and dried fruits. I noticed flavours of bitter oranges, grape fruits, red grapes, raisins, apricots, roasted meat and stewed fruit with whipped cream. Some alcohol is present, too.  The first taste is bitter. It develops into a sweeter powerful taste of dark bread and bitter fruits. Medium to full body. The bitterness is strong, but not overwhelming. Dried fruits, grilled meat, and some roasted malt. The long lasting aftertaste is powerful with an acid addition to the bitterness. There are dried fruits and some vegetables too.  The carbonation is mild, the liquid medium smooth. Fresh, inviting yet highly drinkable.  As one can read in my profile, the American IPA is my current favourite style.

D - High, definitely wanted a second one.  Overall, a good but not amazing beer. Seemed to be lacking a definitive signature. Definitely right for a session.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,katan,3.7,"12 oz bottle from the 2007 batch  a - Poured a nice dark malty looking golden brown color. Very little haze. Pours to a decent head with some retained bubbling.  s - I get hit first with a nice aromatic hop - mostly a citrus note with some grapefruit background. There is some malt in there, but its subdued.  T - Tastes much like it smells - although the initial hop aroma isn't as strong in the bittering hops that finish it off. It has a grassy earthy taste to it. Some sweet malts to round it out.  M - Has a crisp mouthfeel to it - not watered down. Doesn't carbonation backs it up.  D - Very drinkable beer - I'm not sure the hop beat down would be so good after 5 or so. But, certainly a nice change of pace that almost could fit the winter warmer style.  Great beer - glad I have a few for the SB.  Also, it really reminds me of Great Divide's freshhop - wonder if anybody else got that.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MrIncognito,4.17,"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a tuliped pilsner glass.  I bought a 6-six pack of the 2007 in early January after I heard of this beer's existence.  It pours a nice reddish-brown, transparent (not foggy) color with a great off-white head (2-3 fingers) with a careful pour. The bubbles are champaign-like and the head stays solid for awhile. Incredible lacing as I drink. Even at the very end of the drinking session I still had a small 1/4-inch head.  Smell is of oranges and spice, very Christmasy and great for winter. Nice hop smell.  Taste is very hoppy with that same slight orange and spice flavor. Very crisp. No taste of alcohol that I can tell  Mouthfeel is smooth with a bite of hops at the end. Carbonation is just about perfect, not soda-like at all and definitely not flat.  I think this is a very good beer. I could even see drinking this in the summer on a nice evening outside, but perfect for winter. I think it gets better and better as it warms up and like more every time I crack a bottle.  Well worth a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Hojaminbag,4.55,"12oz bottle, 2007 vintage (updated with a 2009 vintage that is the same as the 07 as far as I can tell).  Dark golden/orange color with a tan head of about an inch and half. Great lacing and head retention.  The aroma is full of hops, with bitterness and a ton of citrus to back it up. There is a slight, sweet malt flavor, but it is basically lost with all of the hops.  This is a beer I look forward to every year, and it is a testament to the great things that Sierra Nevada does with hops at an affordable price. Tons of hops dominate the flavor. Orange peel, grapefuit, some bitterness, and a bunch of grassy hop flavor. There is just a touch of sweet malt underneath those hops, but the hops star here, making a great IPA.  Thin body with high carbonation; surprisingly a bit dry for an ipa, but good anyway.  Great beer; I could drink this all night. Considering the price, this beer cannot be beaten.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Overlord,4.1,"Should I factor price into this review? Because at 6.99 a sixer, this is a phenomenal offering. I won't, but keep that in mind.  Pours orange with some golden overtones. Big three or four white inch head after aggressive pour. At least half an inch of head stayed through three quarters of the glass. NIce mouthfeel.  Smells like citrus, pine, and grapefruit. Flavor is not as harsh as many IPAs, with some mellowing sweeter fruit or malt balancing out a nice high hop content. Sierra Nevada has really produced a nice IPA here.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,madjr80,4.02,"This is one of the best hoppy beers that is available in a 12pk. Most of the real good beers come in the six packs or just the 22 oz. I noticed right off the bat that the head retention was incredible. The smell was potent with hops, and is not a beginners beer. The taste of bitter hops lingers on the tongue and has a subtle sweetness. Be careful of having a session on this beer. It can bang you up quick. @12.99 a 12pk it was a steal.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beersabound,3.27,"I love IPAs alot. But this one has some internal fighting going on between the malt and the hops.  The appearance is a amber color with a quickly dispersing wholy head.  The CO2 is high and this added a bit of a fizzle and bite to my tongue.  The aroma is piny and slightly resinous with some toast and a low caramel rumbling.  The flavor is conflicting for me. A bit too much malt sweetness and alcohol for the hop flavor.  I'll finish the six pack but prefer many other IPAs to this. IMO, it's not bad but not great.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Kadonny,4.13,"Poured from a growler about 8 hours after the fill.  A: A dark amber color with a nice 2 finger off white head. Nice lacing on the glass.  S: Hops with some real nice citrus pine straw, a great smelling brew.  T: Hops bitterness, but with a mellow untertone of malt. Lots of citrus with green grass and a slight hint of flower. The finish on the beer really lingers with hop bitterness and a very oily metallic taste.  M: Medium body with an oily mouthfeel and a decent hint of alcohol. The flavor as I said really lingers in the mouth.  D: I would say good. The more you drink of this beer, the better it tastes. I must say though that I have swung to liking the Harvest Ale much more, I think it is just more rounded and has a nice hop malt blend.  Overall this beer is always good and I buy it every year. Sierra Nevada is making some kick ass seasonals and this one follows along that line. I have had better beer, but no doubt this is very solid and I'd drink it anyday.  Update: After having tons more of this beer this past winter on draft and in bottle, I have truly come to love this beer. I updated my original rating from a 3.7 realizing how good this seasonal ale is. I even picked up a case to drink through the spring and summer, it's that good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,flowerysong,4.8,"Appearance: Deep clear copper with a dense cream-coloured head that displays excellent retention.  Nose: Grapefruit and lemon hop aroma. Lots of hops.  Taste: Subdued malt, spicy pine and citrus hops. A bit of grass in the finish. Lingering hop presence. Some fruity esters.  Mouthfeel: Full, creamy body.  Overall: Excellent IPA. Enough alcohol to be warming on a winter night, but not so much as to be overpowering. The balance is tipped slightly towards the hops, but there's a modicum of restraint that's nice to see from the brewer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beerbutcher,4.42,"the beer pours a deep copper with a one finger white head.  aroma is of pungent american hops. loads of grapefruit, slightly floral and piney, with a touch of sweet ethanol and a dollop of caramel.  taste- it's a high volume beer, no doubt. there is a tongue grabbingly rediculous amount of grapefruit which wrings the palate from the get-go. once all that has fully set in, you might notice a trace of caramelized barley in the background braced against the lupulin layer. they battle, the hops win. then the alcohol sneaks in and beats you silly. just the way to end a night.  the texture of this beer is rich expansive and oily. there's a stiff backboard of sweet malt and ethanol that helps to hold it together. best consumed fresh in my opinion, but could age to become quite graceful and balanced. but why wait if the alcohol is already integrated? a treat for the masochist in all of us.  drinkability- unless you're already warmed up, this beer will slow you down. given the style, i think it's very well balanced. it is loud, but everything in it is loud, so they're all screaming at the same volume. oh, a significant amount of lacing was left on the glass by this beer. it's big, it's bitter and it's beautiful.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The expected flavors of an IPA. Mostly hops. Very nice aromatic, floral hops smell. Taste is simlar, to smell, mostly hops. Balanced with some slightly sweet malts. No apparent spices as with some seasonal winter/christmas ales. Pretty much a straight-up IPA.  Don't really know why this is considered a winter warmer, although I'm not complaining, just a straight-up solid IPA (IMO). A good beer, which I expect from Sierra Nevada.

The smell is the only downside in my book, it's nicely evened, but doesn't have that american IPA kick smell I really enjoy in IPA's. This beer has wonderful tingle as you drink.

140,1904,dudeandhisrug,3.95,I was really excited to try this beer because I am a long time fan of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. This beer definately warms the heart during cold winters in the Northeast. I would definatley recommend this beer to anyone. It is hearty but yet drinkable. A revisit in my world.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ardmoreryan,4.31,"Copper color with an off-white, rocky head, lacing the glass as the beer goes down. The head stayed solid for about 5 minutes; after that, it became rocky and dissipated quickly.  Tastes like a stronger Pale Ale with an oily pine scent followed by a nearly overwhelming hops-grapefruit flavor behind. No one does hops nearly as well as Sierra.  As far as drinkability, the Ale goes down similarly to Pale Ale. However, despite the higher alcohol content, there is an easiness to it. The hops don't stick to the back of the tongue in the same way that they do in IPAs and other APAs.  All in all, a remarkable example of American ""craft"" brewing with hops!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,AshevilleSippin,4.03,"Short version: Excellent beer with some substance beyond a double scoop of hops. Needs spiced up a bit to make the flavor worthy of the nostalgic holiday pedastal I put it on.  Details: The SN Celbration Ale is just that. It's a celebration. It warmly reminds me of Christmas 2007 and was one of my staple beverages through the holidays.  Bottle is quite attractive and festive. The kind you like to open your beer fridge and see centered up with the label facing out. Puts a smile on your face even if you are just there for a spare gallon of milk stowed away down below.  Pours a warm deep-copper to amber color showing a boisterous and ample head blossoming with hoppy floral scents. Each successive drink rewards you with a new lacey ring reminding you, sentimentally, of the incremental journey you are taking to the bottom of the glass.  The taste is a lot to absorb all at once. I still don't quite have my palette around all of it. The hops are certainly dominant but there is definitely malt bringing some counter-balance and adding the necessary body to support all that flavor. The finish is bright and slightly lingering.  I have to reiterate the strong hoppy character. It shows through from nose to finish and clearly dominates this beer but not is such a way that it seems undesirably out of balance.  For a holiday/seasonal brew I'd personally like to pick up some more spice in it. It doesn't quite fit the style in my opinion but that doesn't take anything away from the overall quality and enjoyability of the beer. As a true winter seasonal I prefer Pyramid Snow Cap, Highland Cold Mountain, or Sam Adams Winter Lager.  The Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale is very drinkable indeed, if only in measured amounts because of its strong hoppiness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Hoppy + Malty=Delicious. great citrus flavor with a dash of sweetness. almost like drinking a christmas tree, in a good way.  M: leaves the mouth a little dry and warm. so much flavor from the hops.

D: every year I wait for this beer. it reminds me of the holidays and just the winter season in general. very drinkable. its hard not to like this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,chiefydawg,4.08,"Nice orange-amber color with lively head and active carbonation. I dig the micro particles suspended to give a hazy look. The lace is clinging in thick layers to the glass!  Fresh smelling and hoppy. Catching a citrus-pine scent that makes me want to use it for a mouthwash (at near 7% alcohol I might as well).  Tastes as hoppy as the smell, but there was a maltiness lurking below the surface that pounced on my tongue with the hops and tagged teamed it. I still feel as though my mouth won out.  Very nice balance, though I think some slight spice would really put this beer into orbit (ditto for the smell). Just my expectations for a winter ale, but who am I to say? Anyway, I'm not catching that alcohol even as it warms, but this is my second one and I can feel it in my face.  Lighter feel on the tongue for all that it offers, and I like it. clean and somewhat crisp but can stand up to the stronger fare.  Overall a top notch beer that stands neck and cap over its far more more popular pale ale brother.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: A complex blast of hops, what else?  T: Delicious. I could drink this 7 days a week. Hops up front of course, mostly citrusy grapefruit, with some lingering orange zest. A nice strong malt profile compliments the hop bouquet and starts coming through after the initial smack of hops: bready with some caramel and suggestions of toffee.  Smooth and creamy, but with a hoppy bite. Not too much for my hophead palate. If you haven't had it, go buy some now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Appearance: Nice amber...More red than yellow with a 1/4 inch head on the pour  Smell: Hoppy. Mostly cirtus hops and a little bit of a Christmasy maltiness thrown in there for good measure.  Taste: Well it tastes very bitter as per the hops but as the flavors settle on the tongue there is a nice malty sweetness cutting through.  Mouthfeel: A little too carbonated on the basic pour. I suppose I could work some of it out but if this is the way it was intended then I would say the carbonation is a little too much.  Drinkability: The flavors and aromas of this beer just make me want to drink more.

Head drops to about one finger thick, but what's left stays strong and leaves sticky lacing all the way around the glass.  Smell is floral and fruity with a little malt in the background - just enough to balance out the hops.  Taste is similar, with pronounced grapefruit flavor and hoppy bitterness balanced by just enough malt backbone. Simply delicious.  Mouthfeel is rich and full-bodied. Very creamy. I could swish this around in my mouth all night.  The only problem with this beer is that its not available all year round - but I guess this gives us another reason to look forward to the holidays.

140,1904,CrellMoset,4.37,"UPDATED REVIEW: 11/20/2008  2008 vintage from Market Street Wine, downtown location. Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Similar to last years - a very nice, filtered copper color with a thick, solid-looking head with good retention that leaves splotches of sticky lacing. Perhaps not 4.5 worthy, but definitely really good ...  Aroma: A little more pungent and pleasant than I remember. I get more minty notes this time, vegetal, leafy qualities come through really strongly, at least initially. Citrus pulpyness, orange, grapefruit still are strong, and do an admirable job of covering up a doughy, roasted, and pretty dry malt backing. Very, very nice.  Taste: Still nice and bitter - that's what I remember!! Huge piney bitterness, lighter citrus than in the nose, a dry, biscuity backbone ... oo, that hits the spot.  Mouthfeel: Much smoother, pillowy, more even than I remember. Carbonation's a little higher too, I think. Great piney ""afterfeel.""  Drinkability: Still great. A solid IPA and a legendary seasonal, there's nothing not to love about this one. I don't think my score's changed any, but it's still a fantastic beer, and still highly recommended.  *** Had a friend bring over a six-pack for a holiday party a few weeks back. I hadn't had a chance to try one that evening, but there were a couple left over, so here goes:  Regular 12 oz. bottle, poured into a pint glass.  Appearance was very pleasant copper tone with very thick head, good retention, and thick lacing.  Smell is not too terribly strong, although the hops are obviously present, as are notes of citrus and malt. A few other things that are difficult to place, as well - an interesting balance.  Taste is where this beer really takes off. Obviously, the hops are at the forefront of the game, but the previously mentioned citrus and malts are still detectable, both in the first instance and in the aftertaste. Alcohol flavor hardly present at all. Absolutely deliciously, hoppy without being overbearing.  Mouthfeel is also very pleasant, carbonated just about right.  Drinkability is damn good. Just damn good. Everything melds very well. Although I'm not a huge hops fan, the balance here is enough to convince me to try and become one. Two thumbs up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,gabrielpicasso,5,"This is one beautiful beer.  Upon emptying the bottle into a pint glass, I noticed two things right away. The head and the color.  The foam settled into a creamy white head about two and one half inches high and filled the room with the scent of flowers and orange blossoms. Quite remarkable. The color was a deep, luminous copper-bronze, slightly cloudy when held against the light.  Before the first sip I stuck my nose in the glass and enjoyed the aroma. At first I could not place the scent, but as the liquid warmed and relaxed I finally determined that I was smelling apricots, oranges and honey along with the wonderful hoppy floral characteristics. The taste is primarily apricot and honey. The orange comes in through the nose as you tip the glass to drink. I spent a lot of time with my nose in the glass.  The mouthfeel is very nice, thick and creamy as it rolls around on your tongue and the carbonation is just right.

Doesn't look like much, but it smells quite nice. Lightly malty and sweet. Tastes, however, quite hoppy, though not the sort of crazy over the top hops that other beers might go for.  The slight sweetness in the brew makes this far more drinkable than many other IPAs out there.

This beer has one of the best balanced malt taste of any beer I have had That flavor is balanced with some good citrus flavors. Hints of grapefruit and lemon rind. Just can't say enough here.

This beer is nearly all hops, all the time. It smells like fresh hops, it tastes strongly of bitter and citrus hops but the brewer balances the flavor well enough that I don't feel like my palate is under assault.

S: Very strong aroma, lots of hops obviously overpowering anything else, but some floral and sweeter, citrus flavor T: I like this a lot for a american ipa as hops as big and present throughout the beer but is never overly bitter or dry. Aside from hops there is a small floral taste and a sweet ctirusy fruity flavor. Never really picked up on alcohol flavor. M: Medium body and carbonation, very smooth and slightly creamy.

140,1904,lightindarkness,3.36,"2007 release  I've been drinking this most of the winter season and haven't rated it yet. I've noticed in some forums and other reviews that there seems to be some disparity between batches of brew, specifically in terms of bitterness and fullness. The beer I rated, 7316X10[something]13 was pretty bitter.  Pours a deep amber color with a creamy head leaving some generous lace. Smells of hops, soft with a bitter grainy scent. Taste follows the smell basically, with a lot of hops, some bitter pine, etc. Some roundness with a slight sweet smoothness to the hoppy bite. A little malt comes through, but not much. Other tastes kind of come in and out, lemongrass, honey, citrus. I was a little disappointed in the depth and overall character of this beer as a seasonal IPA. A good body with medium fullness, some oily feel and decent combination of smooth/bitter. It's drinkable, but in general I'd pick something else over this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Kemmerlin,4.27,"Poured a copper orange color with lots of floating particles in the glass. Smells of pine and cinnamon are abundant with sweet fruits in the background. Tasted like apricots or orange with pine accents. I had an acidic feel on the tongue and not the toes (inside joke). But the beer was not dry which is a huge plus. And for the drinkability, I would drink this beer like a crazy man. It is really good and I would take six down quickly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BeerCheese,4.38,"Nice crystal clear copper color with a big tan head. Fair head retention. Pleasant smell of both hops and malt. Taste more of hops than malt, which is appropriate for the style. A good IPA for the masses, because it's not TOO hoppy. Just right to introduce someone to IPAs. I did detect a little warmness as it went down too, so the alcohol is evident. Medium carbonation was just right.

The malt does a good job mellowing out the hops but stills leaves a good hoppy flavor.

The label made me think this would have more cinnamon spice in it, but almost nothing but hops. Some creamy malt tones toward the end. M: Very smooth, crisp, easy to drink. D: Very. A strong ale, but not overbearing.  Really surprised that a holiday ale would concentrate so much on the hops without putting in that Christmas spice.

Great pine and grapefruit hop bite, smooth, creamy malt backbone. Really enjoyable IPA.  M: Mouthfeel is medium-bodied but not overbearing. The hops tingle and slightly sweet burn in the finish is great.  D: The ABV is up near 7%, so be aware off that, because it's really hard to stop once you've started. Great session brew to have at a cozy Christmas party.  Unusual to have an IPA as a winter seasonal, and that might turn away some purists, but I wish this were available year-round.

The pour also left a lot of lace on my conic pint glass.  Like most domestic ales, the smell of pine was prominent, piney like a Christmas tree.  A fair amount of pleasant, hoppy bitterness flows over the tongue. The malt comes briefly in the middle of the taste and the bitterness lingers again on the back of the tongue; perhaps it lingers a little too long. The malt becomes slightly more noticeable as the ale warms.  Let this beer warm up after pouring and it becomes more drinkable and balanced. At 6.8% ABV, it is a good beer to sip.

The taste is much more subdued than I expected, more balanced than the usual hop-heavy signature of most CA brewers in general and SN in particular. Not much head retention. The mouthfeel is soft if a bit thin. The drinkability is good, although hops-dominant beers are always an uhill climb for me. A good way to end the year but the name made me expect a winter warmer rather than an ipa.

140,1904,Tang07,4.73,"Yum,  SN had been slippin' the last few years on this brew. They changed it up this year. Historically, this beer has some berry and nutmeg/spice flavors, but it seems that they dropped that and went to a pure hoppy IPA.  It looks great when poured into a glass. Nice dark copper color with a nice heavy head.  The smell is of hop and citrus. The spice that this brew had in the past seems to be either gone or greatly diminished.  It tastes as good as it looks and smells. Heavy on the hops, start to finish. Wonderful winter beer. It was actually cold for a few days and I had to go outside and have a seat and a fine brew  I brought some to my neighbor's house and they were blown away. Then I told them that it was available at the local grocery store now that they've expanded their beer selection they were beside themselves.  the mouthfeel is great and it is very drinkable.

Would not recommend downing these as your tongue nor your brain might be able to handle it. Still, a nice quality drink to sip as winter continues. I poured this into a pint glass and was amazed at the copper, auburnish body. I was expecting a more tan body for some reason. Left two finger head that slowly descended into my mug, and there were some positive lacings left and the bubbles kept rising. I didn't detect too much variety upon smell, I don't think they put in a lot of fancy or even ""extra"" ingredients like most winter beers do, this was just straight hops and malt with some citrus. Unlike regular IPAs, this was only medium bodies, and the hops did not overpower the drink and overkill my pallete. Went down slightly smooth, for a change, and actually improved upon further drinking rather than dry my mouth out a litte. I detected some citrusy in the beer, and I highly doubt it is in there but something like oak or wood or something to complement the backbite from the malt upon swallowing. I will be buying the 2008, I just hope its popularity with the general public doesn't increase (at the local beer store here they had a huge display of this in front and it was about empty) so the price stays the same.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A one finger head holds steady for a while and good sticky lacing clings as the head resides. Aroma-fresh hops, mostly piney with a hint of some citrus. Mouthfeel-good carbonation delivers an initial bitterness. I get a quick taste of some caramel and malt then the hops re-ignite for a rather bitter finish-nice! I have not had SNCA in a few years and this is a great winter hop fix. A froth on the palate really gets this ale going and sweetens it up.

S: All hops and citrus, period.  T: Hops and citrus dominate: orange rind and grapefruit. Almost balanced by a warming alcohol taste and malt. No strange or artificial, gimmicky flavors in this seasonal, just pure hops and malt! I agree with some other reviewers that the beer mellows out as it warms, becoming more balanced.  M: Slightly syrupy, medium body. Perfectly carbonated, smooth yet lively on the tongue.  D: Not what I was expecting at all, and for the better! I enjoyed every sip of this brew, I say sip since it would seem difficult to drink quickly due to the strong hop and citrus character.

A touch fizzy in the mouthfeel, but nice bits of sticky lace like cotton candy are stuck to the sides of my glass. (Admittedly a Laguinitas tumbler.) I'm also surprised at the body; it seems a bit thin and fizzy, yet this doesn't negate the drinkability. The caramel malt and hops dance togther, but the hops take the lead with pronounced pine and grapefruit rind hop flavor and a lingering bitterness in the finish. There's also a bit of carbonic bite. I'm always shocked at how dry this beer is as an IPA.

Drippy patches of lacing left streaks all down the glass.  The aroma was relatively mild initially but came out as the beer warmed. Sweet, spicy and hoppy overall with strong indications of orange zest.  The taste was similar to the nose but a bit more aggressive. Malty and sweet notes came through up front before the spicy, zesty hops kicked in. Citrusy hops prevailed with some ripe fruits appearing mid-palate. A touch of alcohol became noticeable as well. The toasty malts showed up once again before the grapefruit-like finish gripped my palate. For a West Coast IPA, this beer was surprisingly well balanced.  Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, creamy and frothy with a slightly greater than average amount of carbonation. Drinkability was terrific.  At 6.8% ABV, this beer was amazingly sessionable.  I was skeptical as to how or why an IPA would be brewed as a winter seasonal until I tried this one.

Finishes with long, lingering, medium bitterness. Plenty of bite. Slight metallic twang.  Mouthfeel: Good body and average carbonation level.  Drinkabilty: A good beer, but not what I typically think of for a winter ale. I picked up a case of this to see how it ages, i have heard mixed reviews on aging Celebration.

140,1904,beeritron,3.93,"Celebration Ale pours out of the bottle a deep copper color with a foamy tan head that lasts throughout. It lingers on the sides of the glass, creating lacing with every swallow. The smell is a little weak compared to the taste. You sense a nice hop aroma with a little maltiness. The taste, however, is great. It's got a great big hop character balanced by a mild sweetness reminiscent of dark molasses. On the back of the tongue I found that, along with the ruby red grapefruit flavor found in hoppy beers, I tasted maraschino cherries. Overall this is a gem of a Christmas ale. Many times, holiday ales are so sweet and spiced that if you have more than one you start to feel sick.

140,1904,cookin420,4.05,"Bottle poured into a pub glass. Big ol' pale, bone colored head. Beer is a pale, not so amber, yellowish tint with moderate haze. The head remains as a mound in the center, but gone quickly for the most part. The smell is that of an IPA with tones of winter warmer spice but the hop is very dominant. Magnificent. MMM! The three C's, chinook cascade and centennial. I'd know em anywhere because I've used them in my own IPA's for the same reason sierra has; The combo rocks! This is close to perfect. Citric and floral in the hop and plum in the much less evident malt presence. A perfectly balanced American IPA with a winter twist from one of the usual suspects. This brew does incredible things as it mellows in the glass. The hop nose and malt become more up front as the hop bitter and citrus fade a bit. Mouthfeel here is very pleasant. Smooth but sill feels ""pale"" and refreshing. I could drink these all day in January or July. Carbonation stays at the right level for the entire beer despite a pretty aggressive pour. A very drinkable beer, this could get you into trouble at your in-laws Christmas celebration if your not keeping track of how many you toss back, so be aware, this is not s 4.8 % IPA. Not a 9% either but being so easy to quaff, you should only drink more than six around certain company. Again, This is really great stuff but no surprise from pro's like sierra nevada.

Last year I remember this being extremely piney and unbearable but maybe I just got a bad batch. All in all I think it is a bit too sweet and the way the bitterness lasts on the tongue is somewhat annoying.  M- Very carbonated and fairly viscous.  D- I don't dig this one. Had it for the first time last year and absolutely hated it. This year i've warmed to it but it just doesn't seem drinkable to me. The first sip is fine and I don't mind hop bitterness, in fact, I love hop biterness, however the bitter stickiness that lasts for minutes after every sip doesn't appeal to me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,IPAcraig,3.78,"Poured into my De Garre snifter whilst watching my dogs play in the bed.  A nice looking beer: a semi opaque bright red body with tints of orange with a one finger off white head, It faded but left some sticky lacing.  Earthy and piney hops are at the center of the aroma. Fairly bright, but not much else here.  A slightly thin IPA, despite the low carbonation. This beer is very nicely hopped, with a decent malt backbone, but it could use a bot more body. This beer is ver nicely hopped though. Nice and earthy, I suppose this is a bit of a departure from their other more citrusy offerings.  A very drinkable, good tasting, yet unspectacular IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Bowdoinbeerboy,4.22,"Appearance- Pours a medium amber color with a light to moderate head that lingers for a good little bit.  Smell- One of the fruityiest noses Ive ever had, flowers and a sweet odor mixed in.  Taste- Big hop taste up front with a solid mix of bitter taste afterwards, exceedingly tasty brew.  Mouthfeel- Hop flavor has good coverage on tongue, and has good aftertaste.  Drinkability- One of the best all around beers Ive had, a true two thumbs up on this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Grapefruit, caramel, pine, and some mango in the nose. Very aromatic and pleasant.  Plenty of hops. Caramel and malt flavors are balanced beautifuly with the bitterness of the hops. Lots of pine needle, grapefruit, orange, damp bark, and some floral hop flavors in the middle. Finish is quite bitter.  Mouthfeel is soft and rich, a stark contrast to the dry and bitter finish. Drinkability is unmatched. I can drink this everyday of the year (though it wouldn't be a special).  God I love this beer. I have always looked forward to November so I can enjoy this beautiful IPA that manages to pull off being a Winter offering.

S: Aroma of piney hops is evident, but not overwhelming. Malt aroma balances the hop aroma well.  T: Hop flavor is strong, and that is an ok thing. The hop flavor is primarily a piney taste, and its very acidic. Malt flavor is not very noticeable.  M: Very carbonated and very acidic. Leaves a very dry aftertaste in your mouth.

It pours a reddish brown with a foamy and consistent head, leaving a fair amount of lacing along the sides of the glass. The smell is heavy in hops, with hints of fruits (apricot and grapefruit come to mind). The taste is hoppy, slightly bitter, and has the common 'pine tree' factor found in many IPAs and seasonal brews.

Pour into my pint glass is a reddish gold with a short but lasting head; good lacing.  Nose is Cascade hops up the you know where. Grapefruit, with more than a touch of astringent Pine-Sol.  Maybe it's the fact that I can only get this once a year, but the oily hoppiness here is always a little shocking. I'm tempted to call it unbalanced, as I only get a thin, water-cracker like malt behind the big hop-juice. Tastes and feels a bit like evergreen resin....I guess this is a Christmas brew in the sense that if you were to take a bite out of a Christmas tree, this is probably what it would taste like.  In terms of drinkability, I'm one and done with this beer. The hop character is great, but more than one of these at a time, and I grow weary of it. It's a great beer, but it's not necessarily what I would call ""pleasant."" This is some unruly oily-bitter beer, and you have to be in the mood for it.

Large, swarthy patches of foam/lace already covering about 3 fingers of the glass. Almost clear, orangy/amber body with no carbonation lines. Large piney nose even at a few inches away. There is minimal caramel undertones there, but the majority of the aroma is citrusy (grapefruit and orange pith), resiny hop. The taste is much like the aroma, with a bit more malt characteristic coming through. Citrusy (grapefruit once again) hop bit up front, with a smooth malty backbone. Quite flowery. Smooth on the tongue and quite drinkable. I don't want to say that this is a ""pounding"" IPA, but it did go down rather quick and easy, kinda like your mom. Oh, come on, someone had to say it...

140,1904,Wikipeteia,3.58,"As a hop head, I felt required to buy and drink a very nicely hopped IPA-slash-christmas ale. I'll say the following: I'm glad I have Great Lakes Christmas Ale as a local beer and benchmark. This is a great American IPA, and a fairly marginal Winter Warmer/Holiday Brew.  The first pour was much hoppier than expected, the bouquet of the hoppy aroma overtaking my nostrils almost immediately. The head was creamy, sticky and thick, hardly fitting the pint glass I poured it into. The lacing lasted a good long time after the head died down a bit.  The first sip was good, each sip getting better, and more flavors becoming clearer on the palate. I've tasted the slight hint of summer fruits (like peaches and plums in very trace amounts), citrus, and even the very hint of a smoked, almost hickory taste. The carbonation is actually a compliment to the beer -- It's neither too much or too little. Put some in your mouth and hold it for a few seconds, and you'll see what I mean. You'll get pure beer taste before you get the effervescence of the carbonation on your tongue.  All in all, this is a good AIPA, and one that I'd love in the middle of the summer, as I sit outside tending my grill. As a winter warmer, however, there's something important missing that I can't quite put my finger on. Maybe it's the lack of seasonal spice, or maybe it's the abundance of my favorite hops. Whatever the case, I like this beer a bunch.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Hoppy and bitter, but with a brutal malty kick to keep everything in check.  Mouthfeel is great, if just a little too fizzy.  Drinkability is fantastic, a session beer if I've ever had one.

The scent seemed citrus, pine, and floral all at the same time. There was, however, a definite caramel malt tone that became more present as the beer warmed.  T- Lots of citrus hops with more earthy hops in the finish. I picked up the caramel malt flavor toward the end too.  M- Good full-bodied feel with medium carbonation and hop tingle. It was a little foamy.  D- Very good drinkability. It had a bold flavor, but it's easy to drink a couple in an evening.  Overall- It's a nice twist on a Christmas beer.

Aroma is pungent hoppiness, citrus, spices, and sweet malt. I swear that I even picked up a little menthol smell (mint?) as it warmed.  Taste matches the flavor profile. Hops are dominate and provide a sharp tingling bite throughout the sip. That's nicely balanced by a underlying layer of spicy malt that keeps things in check. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice crisp snap to it. Some alcohol beefiness is present but not overly detectable.  Ah, nothing says Christmas like a bottle of Celebration Ale.

I have some questions about this beer. Winter? This beer seems unusual as a winter seasonal, especially considering the fact that SN has a pale ale and IPA that are both available year round. Im also a bit confused as to why this beer seems to be one that is often cellared. Why? The only reason i can think of its popularity in terms of aging is the vintage dating. I'm not saying it doesn't age well, i don't know, i have never tasted an aged example, but it just seems like an unusual choice.

A special beer for the winter season, and yet it largely resembles an American IPA, and their own flagship IPA that they produce year-round. This is my main gripe with the beer... not venturing far from their regular IPA.  Despite the misleadings of the label, this is an excellent brew. The hop aroma is pleasant and strong. Head leaves a nice lace in a tulip glass and retains well. The color is a nice and rich amber. Mouthfeel is excellent, with the hops revealing a nice cascade and citrus/grapefruit finish.

Wow, first sip fills the mouth with a hop presence that while strong is not overpowering, well balanced with the sweetness of the malt and finishes with a nice bitterness with just a hint of alcohol. Has notes of tangy citrus as of a tart but sweet grapefruit. Perhaps a few biscuity tones in the malt taste as well.  Mouthfeel is lively ight to medium bodied, perhaps a bit chewy with just the right amount of carbonation.  I love this beer!

Magnificent!  S: A wonderful fruit and spice bouquet hits the nose as this beer pours out of the bottle. There are bits of apple and grapefruit and pine balaced out by a warming spicey character that I cannat quite put my finger on but feel okay that I can't tell exactly what it is. Even the remains left inside the bottle smell great.  T/MF: Good deal of apple and grapefruit to open which subsides into a sweet malty background that balances out the very aggressive hop bite of nutty pine that leaves the tongue slick sip after sip. The only little thing and it is little is I wish the pine didnt take over so much near the end, other than that this beer is flawless.

140,1904,barrelman,3.58,"2007- served in a tulip in an unheated office, typing with Bob Cratchit type cut-off gloves. Ahem.  This beer even looks like it uses Cascades.  Smell is floral with wet wheat flour (take that snobs!).  I think from now on I'm going to list mouthfeel before taste because it's always a let down to do this one. Cut and Paste.  Taste is terrific, at first. The more I drink it, the stickier the hop aftertaste becomes. Don't get me wrong, I love the icky sticky, but an IPA can present an abundant amount of hops and still finish clean.  Drinkability took two steps back after about 6 ounces. Beer was certainly well hopped with decent balance, but it stayed with me for the next 2 to 3 hours.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jmbranum,4.15,"2007 edition from a 12 oz. bottle  Man alive... this seems hoppier than I remembered. Tons of fresh hop aroma that greets you from the first aroma that sneaks out of the bottle. Imagine a bottle of pacific pine needles on a rainy day in the Northwest aroma.  The taste is heavy on the hops. They have an almost oily lingering quality. Some of the other reviews mention a fainty creamy quality and I can barely pick that up, but really the hops are so strong that the other notes are pretty muted. Lots of warm alcohol too which is nice for this time of year.  On the negative side of things, I miss the maltier version that I remember drinking around say 2000 and 2001. To me this is too much of a hopbomb to do the trick for me as a christmas seasonal. I like more of the nutmeg spicyness and some good roasted malts to balance things out a little. I know there is some malt in this beer (based on its beautiful amber color) but the hops just drown them out.  But if you judge this as an America IPA (which is how BA shows), then this beer kicks ass and takes names.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,timtim,4.5,"just got a chance to have a couple pints of a 2006 vintage (one year old cellared keg obviously!!) at Dr. Dremo's in Arlington, VA... already reviewed this year's batch, but just in case anyone else is curious, it held up really, really well and definitely took on some new dimensions. beautiful appearance with that insane lace that lets you see every sip you took. taste and nose... the hop character held up nicely... the mix of hops that they use seemed to turn in to a nice hybrid that created a citrus flower - almost orange blossom like - taste. malt character really came out as well. soft and smooth. tasty and virtually no bitterness. a real treat. thanks bill!!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,montageman,4.42,"2007 edition. Poured into a pint glass.  Year in and year out Celebration Ale is one of the finest IPAs around. From the rich copper color to the wonderful pine tree and citrus aroma to a drinkability that is close to water, this beer is always a treat. This year's edition is no different. Wonderful piney in the nose and taste with a solid grapefruit flavor as well. I could drink this stuff all of the time. Fine work here. Highest recommendation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Strix,4.03,"Pours a dark amber with a thick head and nice trails of lacing.  Smells a lot like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, floral, citrusy, and hoppy.  Tastes a lot like the Pale Ale too, with a big grapefruit hop presence. The flavor is perhaps a bit sharper and crisper with a long bitter aftertaste. A bit of warming alcohol. Malt presence is in the background, this one is about the hops.  Mouthfeel is adequate, with proper carbonation.  Anybody who likes the Pale Ale will dig this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,zerofear13,4.2,"2007 Celebration Ale, picked up at Community Beverage in Elmhurst. Pours out an impressive deep red, brown color, with a decent frothy head. Smells of citrus and cascade hops. It'll remind you of a stronger Sierra Nevada pale ale. The sweet malts are present, but only behind those cascades. Taste is of wonderfully refreshing cascade hops and sweet malts. Again, I hate to make the comparison, but if you love the pale ale's distinctive hop taste, this is like twice the amount of goodness. Very smooth and crisp, but leaves a rather bitter aftertaste, which isn't unpleasant. Overall, a very, very delicious beer. If this were made year-round, the pale ale would stand no chance. I think this IPA destroys their 2007 anniversary ale, which was a bit disappointing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,argock,4.67,Poured from 12oz brown bottle  A: Rusty with thick sticky head  S: Aromatic hops with slight maltiness -- very earthy  T: Smooth but sharp hops character with just enough malt complexity to make this stellar. Alcohol is not prominent. Tastes as good as it smells.  M: Exceedingly smooth with even carbonation and pleasurable aftertaste.  D: Exceptional offering for hop-lovers who still love some balance.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,warmstorage,3.63,"$8.99 for a six pack at Gold Rush Liquors, Anchorage, AK. Bottle states 2007 edition, 6.8% ABV.  Appearance: Deep orange to light reddish. Dense, off-white head leaves significant lacing.  Aroma: moderate citrus and pine resin hop nose, slight malt notes.  Taste: mostly piney hops, but not a huge IPA hop presence. Like a lot of Sierra Nevada's interpretations, this is a relatively low hopped beer for the style. Some of the spicy earthy hoppiness of Chinook is evident.  Mouth: bright and tingly up front, to a smooth, sweet, somewhat thick mouth. Low to moderate alcohol warmth might account for the initial brightness.  Overall: A decent, drinkable session beer, but nothing special for an IPA, especially if it's considered a West Coast style, hop-pronounced IPA. I really have to think the very high ratings it gets are from those who just love Sierra Nevada. Don't get me wrong: it's good, drinkable beer. It could just be a lot more.  I am delighted to see that Sierra Nevada has made the switch to pry-off bottles that I can re-use for homebrewing.

There's definitely a twang when you take a mouthful but the flavor's good and the hops' carbonation doesn't burn inside your mouth.  Overall, it's pretty easy to drink and is simply a jazzed up IPA, good for those of us that like IPAs but wanted something a bit spicier for the holidays. I'll definitely be having a few more of these for sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Very different than the amber, spice, big christmas style beers which is a nice change of pace, but know not to expect a typical christmas beer.  Pours golden amber copper color with a thick fluffy head that quickly dissappears. Aroma is floral citrus hops with a background sweet malt. There is an initial flavor of sweet maltiness with a crisp bite from the citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is smooth with medium level of carbonation. I would definately have another, doesn't put me in a christmas spirit but a solid beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Superb and very drinkable IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Hugely bitter taste throughout with just enough malt to provide for a pretty perfect balance. Bitter, bitter, bitter, but very good if you like the style as I do.  Full but not thick mouthfeel with good carbonation, though I might let this decant a little longer to get a lower carbonation level.  Excellent beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JohnGalt1,3.88,"Purchased at the Boise Coop for around $1.50. Enjoyed out of my standard red wine glass.  Beautiful crystal clear copper orange with a sticky but shortlived white head leaving quite a bit of lacing.  Cascades cascades and more cascades, but at the same time still softened by a bready malty backbone aroma.  Citrus hop bomb on the palate ... the brew is all about the hops. Balanced with enough biscuity malts and a little caramel sweetness with a lingering bitterness.  Celebration ale is the perfect beer to kick-start the holiday season .... and in my opinion the best IPA SN makes.... Cheers.  Every year, I threaten to buy a case of these and let them cellar until next year ... only to spend my beer cash on too many other winter seasonals.

Herbs, some spice, very floral  Taste: Wow, simply delicious. Incredibly smooth. Not at all too hoppy like i thought that it was going to be. In fact, this is one of the more balanced beers that I've ever had. It's probably the malt sweetness that balances this delicious beer so well.  And there you have it, something that I know will be bought every Christmas. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mashedpotatoes,4.26,"As with most Sierra Nevada beers, the Celebration Ale has a top end with a pronounced zing to it. Not bitter, just pronounced. This seasonal beer is complex but not quite as well rounded as say the Great Lakes Christmas Ale. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than others, taste is a bit bright but a very drinkable ale nonetheless. Lacing was truly incredible. After finishing my first glass I realized the head had laced all the way down from the top to the bottom and remained throughout, really quite beautiful. A must try beer for the winter holiday season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,letsgopens,3.68,An IPA is an interesting style for a holiday beer. This selection pours a bronze amber with a rocky white head that holds well and leaves lots of solid lace.  Some nice hops stick out initially in the aroma with a nicely pronounced malt backbone. A reasonable amount of fruit; citrus and cherry with a bit of spice.  Good hops and spice are there initially. The flavor fades in to fruit and lots of sweet malt. Very flavorful but rather straight forward. My only critique would be that there is not a lot of complexity there. However the flavor is very pleasant and appetizing.  Clean and bright on the palate. The carbonation is moderate with a thicker malty after taste. Smooth but clean mouthfeel. Very nicely done. Very solid and well balanced; characteristic of most Sierra Nevada selections.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tanarm,3.91,"Appearance is a slightly cloudy amber. Pours a nice thick creamy head... excellent head retention. Aroma is a bit piney, some orange peel thrown in. Fresh hops. Taste- More bitter than last year? A slight caramel in the background leads into a whirlwind of hoppy goodness. Orange rinds. Bitter melon... Finishes dry with a lingering bitterness that is very much welcome on this palate. Any more would be swaying on too much, however. Medium body to this IPA. Quite drinkable. The dry finish makes you want more. Overall just as good as I remembered, and maybe more bitter than I remembered... this is one of my favorites.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,iceviper22,3.68,"Got 2 bottles of this in a mixed case of Winter/Christmas ales. Because of this and the way the label presents it, i was surprised when I poured it and was greeted by the flowery hop aroma that is an IPA, instead of the traditional spicy aroma of a winter brew.  Anyway, it pours a nice deep orange, almost reddish appearance with a small fluffy tan head. The smell as I said is the usual grassy, flowery, hopped smell of an IPA with a little orange to it. The taste is a nice balanced hoppy bitterness, yet slightly sweet and refreshing. A good amount of carbonation tops it off reminding me more a summer thirst quencher than a Winter brew but very drinkable none the less.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,rxdrewthejew,4.06,"Number two of the winter beer reviews.  A: Dark amber, almost bordering on red. A bit dark for an IPA. Thin one finger head but lots of retention. The lacing is really nice on this beer.  S: Pretty sublte but a nice balance of hops and sweetness.  T: Major hop blast, grapefruit dominant with some pine. A tiny bit of sweetness and maybe the smallest hint of spice in the aftertaste.  MF: Very smooth despite some major carbonation. Almost mouth-puckering bitterness. Syrupy and moderately thick.  D: I wish they brewed this year round. This rates right up there with the Stone IPA or even the Ruination IPA for me. The hop character is huge, almost to the point of being overbalanced, but there's just enough malt sweetness in there to make it work. My only complaint (I guess ) is that it's a bit of an odd winter release. But that's just being nitpicky. This is excellent.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The taste starts out with a touch of malt but the tongue is quickly bombarded with prickly hop bitterness that stay with you long after the sip. Overall, this is surely a winter classic that is highly recommended.  I have had the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and this was only the 2nd Sierra Nevada I have tried. I found it a Florence Wine and Liquor in NJ and it was reasonably priced at 7.99 for 6 .

For the amount of ""C"" hops, this one has the right amount of malt sweetness in the nose. Taste is great. Hoppy, yet balanced, in a way that only the masters at Sierra Nevada can pull off year after year. Mouthfel is nice. The bittering hops coat my mouth with the oily viscosity that is washed away by the beautiful use of malts, and then quickly reminds me that it is an IPA for the ages with more hops. Drinkability is as good as it gets for IPAs. The only other IPA that can hold a candle to Celebration in my mind is Furious. But seeing as how Furious is about as hard to come by around here as a girl who cooks, cleans, and doesn't talk, and Celebration is in every gas station, restaurant, and corner liquor store, I am quite satisfied and content.

App: Beautiful dark golden color. Not quite as red as I remember it to be last year, although that was a long time ago. Very nice lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: Kick ass hop aroma, yet not too overpowering, exactly what an IPA should be.  Taste: I agree with the previous reviewer who noticed the lack of spice in this years brew, I loved the mild cinnamon flavor of last year, unfourtunately this doesnt have it.

140,1904,MiScusi,4.23,"*SCORE BASED ON THIS SAMPLE* 2007 bottle, poured into a pint glass.  Has the look I was expecting, Orange, clear, with a slightly off white head that is fluffy, rocky and sticks around quite a bit. The smell reminds me somewhat of sierra nevada's pale ale, but this is a little bit more on the sweet piny side rather than citrusy and pine. The first sip has a lot of sweet malt in it, finishing with a sweet pine finish. After that though the bitterness really takes over and coats the mouth. Piny bitterness sticks around to the sides and top of the mouth. The body is on the medium-light side. It's fairly slick, not too tingly in carbonation. ___  10-21-08 2007 Bottle, now about 1 year old. Kept in fridge entire time.  This beer held up amazingly nice. Would have thought it was a fresh bottle if I didn't know any better. Still fresh pine and a good resiny bitterness.  ___  2008 release. 10-30-08  A- Pours orangish, hazy (chill-haze),and with a nicely formed head. This is the first time I can remember not seeing a hint of red in it, in the last 4 releases.  It still has that classic pine taste in it, but it seems like this year they made it more citrusy, more juicy. Really easy to drink. It seems to have less of a bite, or lingering bitterness as years past.  ___  10-22-2006 overall: 4.5 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 5 | drinkability: 5  2006 Release.  Appearance - beautiful crystal clear amber with an off-white fluffy head dissipating pretty fast but keeping a small bubbly cap. Small bubbles rising from the bottom the entire time. Smell is a lot more subdued than I expected, mostly fresh pine and perhaps some slight caramel sweetness.  Taste is a deliciously smooth pine with a lingering aftertaste of bitter resiny hops. I don't find this that extreme as far as bitterness, and actually think it's more refined and smoother than the regular pale ale. The mouthfeel makes this perfect, the carbonation is there but definetly not too much, it lets the drink take on a slightly slicker mouthfeel. These together make the drinkability pretty spectacular.  [ serving type: bottle]",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tronester,4.08,"Pours a clear amber, with a medium tan head. Smells of malt and hops. Tastes of rich malt, slightly toasty, with a slight hop flavor. Good bitterness from the hops, with a full mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little high, but nothing that would detract from its score. Pretty drinkable for an IPA. This years batch is very good.

140,1904,ksbrainard,3.85,"Appearance: Sparkling crystal clear with effervescent bubbles percolating upwards in perpetuity. It is a tan/red color that just glows. There is a small but persistent head, which ends up looking much larger towards the end (you know, since there's less beer to measure it against).  Smell: Citrus hops. There is a bit of barely detectable malt. But for the most part this is absurdly citrusy hoppy smelling. Dare I say too many hops?  Taste: Hops at the start, hops in the middle, and hops on the finish. It starts with a bitter grapefruit and a mild caramel undertone. It has a nice little dirty taste of hop bitterness and malt flavor. In taste, there is a semblance of balance amidst the massive hops. But really the hops are running the show. If this is really 6.8% ABV, it is completely hidden - I would have guessed 5.5% maybe.  Mouthfeel: Good and solid. There is a definite malt presence, which creates a body that this beer desparately needs to hold itself up. The hops are strong, but they don't dry it out too much on the aftertaste.  Drinkability: Great, if you're a hophead. I find it easy to drink and enjoyable. But you have to love hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I am a huge hop head so I like it. However, I was expecting it to have some more spice & complexity to it. It's really more of your typical IPA. Last years stock wasn't the best ever, but it had an excellent spice/cinnamon thing going on and I may have enjoyed it even more than this year. IMO, if they would merge this year & last it would be perfect. On to my review... A - Nice auburn with slight puffy tan head that laced the glass well. S - Hops, hops, hops. T - More hops, where's the spice? Some citrus & pine bite, but bitter hops all the way.

140,1904,errantnight,3.96,"Ahhh Celebration Ale time! It's that special time of year when Sierra Nevada brings us... an IPA. In the middle of winter. OK, it's confusing, but it's damned tasty (and I guess for some people an introduction into the IPA style).  So I poured it into my Stone Levitation tulip and it looks purrrdy. Beautiful ruby, orange clarity topped with three gorgeous fingers of frothy head which clings. Nice lacing. Makes you want to drink it.  Aroma is really the only area of this beer that comes up a bit short or me. Hops predominate, a lil pine in there, and toasty malt (that doesn't pop up until it warms appropriately) in the background. Yeah, I know, it SOUNDS good, and it IS good, it's just kinda mild. I'd give SN's pale ale the edge in aroma.  Taste is a superb example of a well-balanced IPA. The toasted malt is there with an ample note of sweetness that runs smack into a wall of hops that are heavily grapefruit-y and pine-y. Nice clean finish with a hint of lingering bitterness. Almost minty.  Mouthfeel is just about perfect. Medium bodied, crisp carbonation, well-rounded.  Y'know, every year I get some, and I even get excited about it. And I end up getting more later because it's an equal-opportunity IPA, and everyone likes it, and if people don't love IPAs they still kinda come around on this... but really... I can get better IPAs all year round... why not get something I CAN'T get all year round instead?

Not a very inviting introduction, especially for a beer made for this season.  Now for a sniff... that's better. It has a ""wintery"" aroma to it with pine being the foremost impression. Grapefruit is there for sure also, and as usual for a Sierra Nevada beer, a good amount of malt.  Taste followed the aroma pretty closely, with everything blending well together. Very pleasant.  Nothing special as far as mouthfeel. Felt a bit thicker than it looked, and maybe it could have used just a hint more carbonation. Not bad, but not memorable either.

Celebration Ale is a solid IPA that I would happily drink again, but doesn't feel like anything special to me.

140,1904,BeTheBall,4.1,"Poured in to a pint glass from a 12 oz. bottle. Nice golden translucent color, with a small but lasting head; good lacing. This one is a nice dose of mild but tasty hops when I'm not in the mood for a DIPA or IPA in that my pallet isn't as wiped out. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to try a ""hoppy"" beer but has been shying away from IPA's or stronger. Easy to drink and excellent taste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,hwwty4,3.78,"Poured a nice mellow amber color with a slight cream head that dissapated pretty quickly, but pretty carbonated so it was bubly all the way through. Smelled like citrus and hops. I couldnt really nail down the fruit because the hops was so prevalent. Taste was hoppy with a little floral but mostly hops. To be completly honest, Ive read many people rave about this beer so thats the reason I went out and bought it. I was a little let down. I didnt think that it was all that complex.

140,1904,racer2k,4.88,"I will preface this review and say that this is my favorite beer of the year. I anxiously await the first arrival of Celebration Ale in New England. I am sure that the west coasters get to taste the annual rite of the holidays a few weeks earlier. In any event, the beer is as good as ever. My first observation is that there is quite a lot of head in the pour and the color seems a bit darker than years past. A solid dark copper / orange color resonates in my glass. A few more details.  A- Dark copper color, thin lace on the side of the glass that settles down after a few sips. Good carbonation which seems to be more prominent with all SN beers with the new bottle opener caps  S- Strong hops, grapefruit, pine, flowers, and a bit of malt  T- Flowery resin laden hoppy taste with grapefruit and a bite at the end  M- Medium carbonation, medium to full body and a hoppy resin finish  D- Holiday beer, session beer, daily beer..pick one...This is a truly one of the best SN beers ever and they do it right ever single year!  I am waiting to crack my 2005 Celebration Ale for a taste off....  Yes indeed..the arrival of an old friend!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mikesgroove,4.97,"Ahh, the return of an old friend. I await this one to come out every year, and every year pick up a couple cases and have one every night from now until New Years. This years I have to say is fantastic. A big hop presence was added and it really showed. Poured a nice amber, not as dark as years past, but with a very sticky and foamy head on top, this one was here for a while. The smell was obnoxious, it was so sticky and fresh with hop resin, I did not even know what to do. Such a great mix of pine nugget freshness with a little bit of spice mixed in, dare I say perfect. The flavor was nothing short of extraordinary with a deep rich and stick hop profile, it was much better then any I had tried the last few years. Overall this was great and far exceeded last years version. This is a huge hop monster this year and it really needed to be. I am thrilled to see this back around and it is a real treat. Go out and get some, you will not be disappointed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I wouldn't say this is one of my favorites but still good none the less.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tpd975,4.33,This is my favorite of the Sierra Nevada brews and was happy to see the 2007 batch hit the shelf.  A: Pours a nice golden orange color with a thunderous head. The head is thick foamy. It dies down but enough stays around to leave sheet after sheet of lace.  S: Nice piney aromas with hints of grapefruit. There is a hint of malty toffee sweetness in the background as well.  T: Nice IPA taste. Tons of citrus and a hint of pine. It's a well brewed warming beer. One of the better tasting IPA's out there.  M: Medium bodied yet filling.  D: Soo drinkable. I will be sessioning with this one by the six pack until the shelves are empty.  Overall: I love christmas for all the unique spiced ales. But this is the one I pound season after season. I like to drink all the special brews the best brewers but it's this macro micro that I love. I am a sucker for IPA's and any brewer that would put one out as its christmas brew earns extra points with me. This beer shows that IPA's are for all seasons. Cheers to Sierra Nevada for being different.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mat5175,2.78,"Bought this to try a little fall tour of the Winter Ales.  This pours a nice tan colored head, about a finger thick, that didn't last all that long and left some lacing. Great light amber color with pretty active carbonation.  This has a typical IPA smell. Floral, not as spicy as some of the type, 471 for example. Not as much aroma as some.  This has an average body in on the palate. Nice small and active bubbles.  The taste is very true to the type. Having said this, it isn't impressive for the type either. Very bland on the front, then the hops take over in the aftertaste. Very clean hop taste, bitter, but not as spicy as the IPA's i tend to like better than this one.  This is not a bad IPA at all. If you like IPA's a lot, give this one a try to add to your repetoire. Otherwise try some of the more varied and interesting special winter releases.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,nickfl,4.15,"A - 1.5 fingers of slightly off-white head on top of a slightly hazy, copper colored body.  S - Strong resiny, piney hop aroma. Citrus, caramel, some pine... spicy, peppery.  T - Strong hop flavor and bitterness up front. Black pepper and lemon flavors. Slightly roasty caramel. A little bit of alcohol.  M - Medium body and high carbonation.  D - For such a bitter beer this is quite drinkable. There is a good bit of hop flavor and especially aroma, but this one is really all about the bitterness. I am normally a bit cynical when it comes to super bitter beers from the west coast, but this is a classic. The bitterness is overwhelming, but characterfull. This beer pairs magnificently with rare, tuna soft tacos and hot mango salsa.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,saintwarrick,4.88,"Finally get to try this brew after years of it never being available. Light cloudy amber with a big pale ale head that clings to the glass; a perfect looking beer with a big nose, pine needles, fresh cut grass and some maltiness in the background signal this as a nicely balanced beer. Taste backs that up, the hops are big without being too overwhelming, nice bitter sweetness to the brew. Very smooth and the hop kick at the end gets you good.  Would love to have a keg of this around Christmas with a nice fire. Awesome brew, probably the best I have had from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,wagenvolks,3.73,"12 oz. bottle into a chalice.  Pours a gorgeous amber-copper body, clear with ample carbonation. The head is sizable, light tan in color, and shows good retention and lacing. I served this one at ~46 degrees, and the hops were a bit muted in the aroma. As it warmed, though, the foresty, hoppy smell really pulled through. Hints of citrus, pine, and sweetbread are also detected.  The taste is definately in-your-face, with hoppiness to boot. It's a bit one sided, however, and the piney, medicinal hop flavors reminds me more of an English IPA than most of the fruity, resinous american counterparts. Some malts eventually show up as the beer warms, bringing with it a muted sweetness. The mouthfeel is crisp, with a sticky body and a lingering hoppy aftertaste. I like. This isn't an exceptionally easy drink. It does however, pack a punch that hop-heads will love, although fans of english-style IPA's might find it more up their alley.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Good classic IPA taste, good out of bottle, but great from the tap.  Mouthfeel - Very nice actually. Most IPAs tend to dry my mouth out, but the Celebration Ale leaves my mouth wanting more.  Drinkability - It's a great beer to enjoy, but you don't want to overload on it. It's the holiday treat we all wait for.

140,1904,pwoods,4.72,"12oz. brown bottle from Krogers in Winton Place, poured into a pint glass.  A: Bright rusty orange pour that's completely transparent. 2 1/2 fingers worth of rocky white head with some great rentention. Finally dies down to a bunch of clumpy islands. Big chunks of lacing at the top followed by good patching.  S: BIG floral, pine-y, and citrus hops all at the same time... All the while having a Christmas-y backbone to it. Smells amazing.  T/M: Bitterness is just amazing. Very strong with just enough malt rescue to save your tongue. Unfortunately, that's all you see of the malts; A slight sweetness to hold back the hops at the last second. Other than that, the hops are awesome. Big juicy grapefruit and lime oily notes and a pine-y and grassy backbone. Body is medium light with a surprising smoothness to it. Finishes nice and dry with lingering bitterness.  D: I'll have quite a bit of this throughout the holidays. Only thing holding back the taste(though not much) is the lack of a more defined malt character. I know hops are supposed to be the mainliner, and I love that, but it needs a bit further touch of complexity from the other side. I also think this would help the mouthfeel a bit, too Appearance was close to a 5, also, but I like my IPA's hazy instead of clear. Knit-picking, maybe. This brew is very close to perfect scores.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ewright,4.53,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a DFH snifter, I got a decent finger's worth of head that was slow to dissipate. There was a small amount of lacing on the side of the snifter. The beer pours a beautiful copper color. The aroma is outstanding... would have received a 5 if it were a bit more bold.  This beer hits the tongue with a vengeance. Hops up front, hops on the back side, malt showing through in fits and spurts. The lupulins dance on the tongue, producing a tingling sensation that cannot come merely from the carbonation. Unlike many winter beers, this one has no added spices... with such a big hop profile, none are needed.  This beer is a bit too strong to be a session beer, but it is an outstanding example of an IPA, which happens to be my favorite style. I'd love to see this one year round!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Poured a crystal clear honey amber with a nice 1 finger head that reduced down to 1/2"" and stayed throughout the drink, actually had a nice foam ball at the last swallow. Medium lacing that was quite heavy in some places. Nice clinging that was better than most any other brew I've tried. Medium mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. Nice smell of hops, very clean. Taste was very good, very crisp with a nice citrus after taste. Very refreshing and a great year around beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MMAJYK,3.7,"A- Orange, brown (copper) with bright yellow tint. White 1 finger head after a semi aggressive pour. Lacing goes away and is just a little bit sticky.  S- Strong smell of hops, honey, cinnamon and citrus.  T- Very hoppy and bitter. Honey, citrus, and a bitter butterscotch complete the taste.  M- Bitter and semi thin. Carb leaves a sting on the tongue. Mid to high carbonation.  D- Too bitter for me to have a lot. While it is a good beer, there are others out there for the winter that are better. This is an offering that is very unique, and you have to applaude that.  Overall- You must keep in mind that it does carry the ""winter brew"" name, but not the characteristics. For what it is, an IPA, it is a nice beer. It is hoppy and dry, just like an IPA should be. If you think of it as the typical winter beer, you will definitely be let down.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Traquairlover,4.27,"This was the 2007, drunk from a Guinness pint glass, refrigerated.  A = Nice clear dark amber, light copper colour, one finger of head.  S = Awesome on the nose. Clear and pleasant hops, but not overly aggressive. Some spice apparent after the initial floral impact of the hops. Brings to mind SN's IPA but better balance between the hops and the malt.  T = Taste follows well on the nose. Good healthy taste of hops, slight bitterness but not overdone, with a definite malty backdrop. Should note that though I detected some slight spice in the aroma, I cannot really taste it. The astringency from the hops reappears in the finish which is good but dissipates a little quicker than I would have liked. Above average but not quite distinguishing enough to be great.  M = Slight carbonation tickles the tongue and the felling a pretty smooth but somewhat thin even given the style. Good, but not really anything to set it apart.  D = Very good drink to end a hard day (as I am doing now as I write this). Absolutely nothing against this beer.  There are a lot of beers I might rather drink but would not hesitate to serve this to anyone who comes over. I would echo some other reviews in saying a great IPA, not necessarily a standard approach to a winter brew though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MICAMD,4.1,"A- A ever so slightly cloudy copper liquid with absolutely no streams of rising carbonation. The head is big, thick, and craggy that simples the top of the liquid and leaves some lacing.  S- Grass, citrus, a little bit earthy. Very malty. I love how subtly spicy this is.  T- Wonderfully hoppy with a smooth, caramel malt backing. A little spicy. Alcohol is just slightly noticeable. I still find it hard to fathom aging this.  M- Very crisp and smooth. Not overly drying. The carbonation level is great.  D- A very tasty and easy to drink beer. I missed this over the past year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,AustinBeerLvr,4.52,"A: 12 ounce bottle w/a freshness date (although a bit challenging to find if you aren't familiar with Sierra Nevada's freshness dating method).  S: Nose of this brew is simply exceptional. The deep cascade hop character is simply fantastic. There are a few other scents in there as well, but the cascade hops purely dominate.  T&M: Just a touch of caramel sweetness and then this brew takes off into one huge cascade hop bite--in an awesome way! The hops linger for a very long period of time, but the whole way through a very faint caramel backbone keeps everything well in check. Especially during the first few sips, the aftertaste of the hops is very prevalent. Mouthfeel is awesome, as it firm, a little creamy, and then thins out just a bit at the end leaving you wanting more.  D: This is simply an awesome brew, something I actually wish Sierra Nevada would just brew year round, as it's without a doubt one of the top IPAs I have ever had. The thing is, if you want a ""Holiday Beer"" or ""Winter Warmer"", this may not be you beer, as it doesn't have the holiday spices or typical ""Winter Warmer"" feel. That being said, the drinkability is very good, although after a few, I think I might have to slow it down, as the high hop character as well as the high ABV are nothing to be fooled around with. To sum up, this is one awesome offering from Sierra Nevada. Buy it while you can. Better yet, buy a lot and save some up, as IPAs tend to age fairly well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,YankChef,4,"12 oz Bottle poured into pint glass. 2007 VIntage  Appearance: Pours a very light brown with a very strong crimson hue, it almost looks like a red ale. 1/2 inch fluffy white head that leaves clinging lacing all the way down the glass.  Smell: Fresh hop oil hits the nostrils first, subtle fruity aromas penetrate the nostrils next. Fresh grapes, peach,apple and there is definitely a subtle freshly cut grass aroma as well.  Taste: This beer is fresh and the hops dominate. The malt has been given no time to pull through so the flavor is bitter and earthy, not in an unpleasing way. As you drink it the more subtle fruit flavors come out, but this beer is certainly an example of IPA balanced imbalance  Mouthfeel: Dries the mouth out and leaves an alcoholic astringency. Medium carbonation and moderate bodied  Drinkability: The bitterness keeps you wanting more as it seems to taste more and more balanced as you drink it since you palatte has been hammered by the hops",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PhageLab,4.12,"2007 brew poured into a standard pint glass.  A - Nice frothy head on this roasted brown IPA. Took a while for it to disappear too. Laced very well in well rounded layers that reminded me of sedimentary rock.  S - Hoppy pine with some spice and perhaps even nutmeg. Can't even detect the alcohol on this one.  T - Actually not as potent as it smells. Slightly bitter, the hops really shine through and although I wouldn't necessarily consider this a hop bomb, they are without a doubt the dominant force here. Finish is somewhat caramel and sweet.  M - Medium bodied and very dry. Pine aftertaste lingers and yet no residue. Pretty impressive.  D - Good, I could easily kick back with a few more. Overall this is a great beer and I'm actually glad they only release it around the winter, gives me something to look forward to again next year.

140,1904,CharlieMopps,4.52,"A: A dense wall of white, fluffy head forms from a moderate pour, nearly four fingers worth when allocated to a curvy Samuel Smith pint glass. The head dissipates incredibly slow, leaving behind small trails of lace on its descent. The color is a deep ruby-amber, clear and letting in much light so that it shimmers a bit, looking rather enticing.  S: The aroma of floral hops pervades the nose, with a bit of spiciness, a grassy touch, as well as even a small showing from citrus hop notes. Smells rather well-rounded, and definitely not a hop bomb, but a beer with a defined array of bitterness, in addition to a somewhat sweet side.  T: Introduction is rather mild, but eases right into a hoppy middle that asserts itself, but doesn't kill the palate. A rather herbal and grassy set of flavor profiles enter gradually and lead to a smooth finish. Aftertaste of hop oil lingers pleasantly and then fades out nicely.  M: Solid carbonation and full mouthfeel, which is creamy and effervescent. Hops leave an oily feel on the palate, but as mentioned above, the taste is enjoyable.  D: This is one I look forward to each year, as I find it to be a mild IPA that still brings forth a great deal of hop flavor. Even though it's a seasonal release, Celebration Ale seems quite versatile, as it could work really any time of the year. Great hop profile, plenty of aromatic goodness, and quite a level of drinkability make this one a perfect go-to beer around the holidays.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,MarkSCCOT,4.17,"Hmm, Sierra Nevada knows how to make an IPA and at least (with the exception of Bigfoot), stick to it.  Poured from a 12 ounce into a pint glass.  A. Average. A reddish mahagony light clear brew with a small head that settles to little or nothing with no lacing.  S. I could tell this was a SN beer with my eyes closed. Big piny citrusy grapefruit hops with little to no malt.  T. Similar to it's smell. Big West Coast hops. Pine, grapefruit hops. The malt is more evident in the finish.  M. Citrusy oily beer with a clean finish.  D. A great winter session beer.  My only down is that it tastes real similar to most of their other beer. Bigfoot Barleywine (esp. aged, the 2004 was spectacular) and the Harvest (even more hop slap) are different, but the rest of the line is real similar. I think that when I first started in craft beer this would have been too much beer for me.

Enjoyable dryness, manipulated well with the carbonation levels. Fantastic aftertaste that hides the 6.8% well.  I discovered my winter session beverage when I picked this up.

140,1904,meechum,4,"Vintage 2007, poured into a pint mug (it's all I had). I guess I'm not much of a fan of SN's pale and IPA. To me this was way too hoppy and didn't have enough balance. I rated the way I did because it's within the style and I think the brewer totally achieved what they set out to make, and though reviews are supposed to be subjective I can't see cutting down a beer I didn't like because of my personal tastes.  Poured a nice deep amber to copper color with a good head and nice lacing. Had a nice hoppy smell of simcoe or cascade (I'm still learning my different hop smells). The taste was just very hoppy for me and I just didn't enjoy it at all but I think it was the way they wanted it to be.

140,1904,bunnyhustle,4.7,"Nearly a perfect beer! 2007 batch pours a brilliant amber color with nice thick, two finger, slightly rocky head. Great retention and amazing lace. Each sip leaves a ""lace ring"" behind like ring on a tree trunk or layers in the earth. Amazing. Smell is strong of hops, not like a typical ""winter"" beer. Taste is incredible, one of the best beers I've experienced yet. Strong hop punch at the start, definitely was not expecting that, followed by a nice touch of caramel and toasted grains as it goes down. I've yet to experience an IPA like that before. Normally the hops from start to finish bore me but the hop punch followed by the caramel flavour is incredible. Smooth and crisp going down leaves behind a semi-sweet, oily aftertaste.

140,1904,Slatetank,4.5,"I picked up a six pack of this at the Ft. Indiantown Gap PX. Decanted cool at approximately 50 degrees into a goblet.  A - A brilliant honey color of ale, deep amber w/ a copper shade. The off white head is a big 3 finger and creamy is appearance like cool whip w/ spaces along the sides and an indented center that formed like a beer head atoll. Th lace is smooth and clings well.  S - Whoo Whee! - such a special hop aroma, so fresh and intense. The allusions to the quality of this beer seem to be on the money. Such a big aroma w/ a citrus and oily hop quality. A slightly candy like sweet malt note is there under the green piney scent. It is an aroma so big you can almost see it.  M - A gently astringent feel w/ mild acidity and a rich malty feel w/ a lemony zesty citrus and leafy oily hop texture that has just the right amount of carbonation.  T - When great hop flavor and beautiful malt flavors collide they make a very, very flavorful ale. The yeast just amplifies the beautiful marriage of malt and NW hop character just brings an inner smile wih each sip. I have tasted this beer almost ritually over the years but this version really hits the mark. A great winter beer, IPA that could be something I would drink year-round. 2007 is a great year of SN celebration, better than I have ever remembered.  D - Just magnificent and was well worth the $6.85 I spent at the PX to get the sixer. I will definitely need to pick up a case or two of thes wonderful beers, just get a Celebration ale for a great taste - I'm a believer. Is 2007 the year of the hop?  2008 - bottle A -4.5 S-4 M-4.5 T-4 D-4.5 A -Fiery amber w/ bone white cap - great lace! only slight haze M - Mild bitter, full med carbonation, crisp and slightly resinous w/ a nice acidity/sweetness balance  S- The aroma is a c-fest, lots of grapefruit w/ subtle floral elements  T - The taste is slightly strong at first w/ alcohol and a nice citrus rind-like astringency w/ the july sweetness of a clementine and the bitter pinch of ruby red. The malt supports the hop intensity well w/ the kind of backbone it needs  D - A great IPA, substantial beer overall w/ west coast hoppiness. I want more w/ each sip - this is excellent w/ simple foods like a starchy baked potato and butter. Sierra deserves love from hop heads for the awesome consistency -a beer you can rely on yearly",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,timbro81,4.47,"Sierra Nevada knows how to make holiday beers; Fall - IPA, Winter - IPA, Boxing Day - IPA, Mother's Day - IPA. Anywho, this years celebration pours a modest head that doesn't stick around for too long. Smells of big citrus and piney American hops. It tingles the tongue, first with carbonation, then with hops that linger around for a while. Obviously it is very hop forward, the maltiness is very well hidden, caramel malts creeps up the back of your throat after a while. I don't have anymore Anniversary Ale but would really like to taste the two beers together, they seem very similar. I will drink many of these in the weeks/months to come",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A-Poured a rich copper color, with just fewer than two fingers of head, lasted a while, with some good lacing that clung to the glass for a long time. S- Hops!! Lots and lots of hops. Sweet, spicy smell, flowers and pine forest as well. T- Hops, as you would expect from the aroma. Smooth malt flavor, and some citrus notes. D- Very drinkable beer. Smooth and easy to drink, but very very flavorful, this is a great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,berserker256,3.7,"Nice reddish golden beer. Thick lasting head with a lot of lacing. Heavy hop aroma. Smells like a pine tree and flowers. It smells like I've been whacking my way through an upper Michigan blue spruce farm with a machete while lost hunting whitetails. I'm not a huge I.P.A. fan but this is a good specimen of that style of beer. Typical I.P.A. bitter aftertaste is present. Good carbonation. Not too thick or thin. But not a ""drink all night"" beer either. Pretty easy drinker for 6.8% alcohol.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SafeAtFirst,4,"Poured into a Duvel Tulip  Color is a medium colored copper with good clarity and nice carbonation. The head is thick and off-white in color. Moderate lacing.  Aroma is bursting with resinous chinook hop oils (grapefruit and pine). Some sweet caramel aromas as it gets closer to room temperature.  Flavor is dominated by a grapefruit-like bitterness. The caramel malts attempt to balance the beer out but mostly fail. Bitterness lingers a good while after the swallow but is not overly intense. As the beer warms and my palate adjusts to the hops, the finish becomes smoother and less bitter. Mouth feel is pretty average for the style.  Overall, another solid beer form Sierra Nevada. Personally I liked the balance and cascade hop aroma of the Anniversary Ale better, but the Celebration is still a good, well made beer. They must use more chinook in this beer versus the Anniversary.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,eatdrinknbmerry,3.73,"Bought this today from the Beverage Warehouse in Culver City with high recommendations from the salesman. Aside from the fact that the label looked like the work of Hallmark, I was very excited to try this after drinking SN's Anniversary Ale, which was superdelicious.  I poured the beer and loved the dark amber color of the beer. The head was slow at forming and didn't build up very much  only lasted a few seconds.  The aroma is quite light and subtle.  Now for a taste... hoppy but not a sustaining bitterness.  I didn't have last year's Celebration Ale, but if I were to compare it to the Anniversary Ale, it'd be lagging a bit in the race.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,biking4beer,3.56,"2007 Vintage.  I felt like this one was different enough from last year to merit another review.  Beautiful beer. Crystal clear copper. Pours a big foamy 3 finger head that dissipates to 2 fingers. Nice lacing before I even take my first sip.  Smell is of HOPS. Chinook all the way. Pine and grapefruit. Centennial and Cascade can barely get through. Slight skunk that some people refer to as ""catty.""  Super bitter. My tongue has been pretty immune to hop bitterness lately, but this beer smacked those taste buds back into line. Grapefruit bitterness overwhelms everything else. No balance whatsoever.  High carbonation and dry. Hops sting your mouth.  It was nice to feel that hop bite again. Reminds me of the first time I had a Stone IPA. Very good beer, but the ratings are a little low for me for a complete disregard for balance. I know it's an IPA, but some sweetness is good in my book. Maybe in a couple of months, this one will even out a touch.  Hey, I reviewed this beer 1 year ago to date.  2006 vintage review moved to here due to impending deletion. 4.05  12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a nice big, foamy, and white two finger head that leaves a nice sugary looking lace. The head sticks around nicely. Beer is a nice pale golden color with slight red hues. Good looking beer.  Slight citrus and pine aromas. Nice and crisp like a wet/fresh hop brew.  The first thing I notice about the taste is the really nice balance of malts and hops. What a nice, even beer. Slight bitter grapefruit finish.  I thought the carbonation and overall feel of this beer was about perfect for it's style. I could definitely drink a few of these, but it definitely takes some warming to get the good flavors out. The last sips were definitely the best.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

APPEARANCE: Clear light-ruby colored with half-inch head dissipating to pleasant layer of bubbles on top - lots of bubbles on side of glass.  SMELL: Pine hops and spice.  TASTE: SO FRESH! YES! dry fresh pine hops with a bit of spiciness in there... caramel finish... I had a huge mug of this stuff, and could have had another... this is a great brew!  MOUTHFEEL: Thicker than I would've expected for this brew... but with the carbonation, it was right on spot.  DRINKABILITY: This is an awesome beer. No kidding. I don't know what it's like from a bottle, but from a keg on it's first day of being released to the public, it is absolutely wonderful. It has all the complexity to keep you interested, but not so intense to make it non-sessionable.

140,1904,hustlesworth,4.68,"2007 holiday beer without all the spices and stuff.  A- poured into my lightbulb-shaped hue-separating tulip glass, this slightly hazy brew was a beautiful ruby-red grapefruit copper up top in the bowl with golden amber in the stem. huge amount of color difference. 2in of chunky wrinkly off white foam with great retention left lots of tiers of wavy lace and settled to a thin soapy disk.  S- fruity citrus pine, woodsy spiced fruit maybe cranberries, orange, and grapefruit with just a hint of nutmeg. JUST A HINT. earthy malty aromas along with alcohol to warm your face a little.  T- bitter tangerine, lemon, parsley, oily resinous pine tar with another citrus/grapefruit kick. the hops linger throughout, malt meets em half way with some toasty bread and tobacco, fruity again towards the end this time with a currant/cranberry/kiwi zap behind the bitter dry puckering woody herbal finish.  MF- smooth, slightly thin feeling yet oily and resinous in the mouth. slick and coating with medium carbonation, finishes dry and tart and makes you want another drink.  D- limited availability and intense flavor would make it hard to session.  2008 review: A+ A- same nice reddish copper amber but with a softer, less rocky, melting ice cream type head and of course plenty of crusty lace S- outstanding pine and grapefruit aroma, cascade and centennial being one of my favorite combinations. toasty malt underlay with a little sweetness. T- woodsy, herbal, and resinous with notes of bitter orange, cranberry, and thyme. some burnt caramel at the finish with a hop flavor that last forever. MF- resinous body with velvety medium carbonation, hop oil coats the palate along with some dryness. D- a masterpiece i look forward to every year, perfect combination of hops and toast.  review of 2007 batch one year later: a year has done much to mellow this all-star and many small bits of yeast are spattered at the bottom of the glass. hops have toned down into a seamless line of pine and grapefruit and malt is toasty burnt caramel as it will ever be. slightly more in balance, and not quite so aggressive.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Beerbuddha,4,This beer poured a deep copper color and had a thin off white head which lasted just a little bit. The aroma was of piney-hops and hints of citrus. The taste was all pine. The hop bitterness dominated this beer which was fine with me. It left a nice aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a medium body with medium carbonation. Overall drinkability is good. I could tire of the bitterness after a while but for the most an overall great beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,WaveRebel51,4.32,"Deep, amber color with slight hazinesss. Thin foam has that fresh from the fermenter look to it. Smell isn't as strong as other dry-hopped brews I've had, which is too bad because there is a pleasant, sweet, fruity aroma to the brew. Hop bitterness and the citrus twang dominate the taste. Hard to detect any balance, but I found that the citrusy character really mellowed out the bitterness. Is it possible for hoppy citrusness to balance out hop bitterness? Whatever it was, it was very very good. The alcohol is pretty prevalent and hits you pretty quick, but I still found this extremely drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Pleasant, but not overbearing head about 1/2 inch w/ lively carbonation.  Smell: Aroma of citrus is throughout this brew. Oranges and grapefruit scents are present from the wonderful cascade and centinnial hops.  Taste: Fabulous flavors. The citrus aromas that preceded the drink are ever present in the flavor. Pleasantly bittter. Malts are quite light and the hops seem to be driving this brew, but in a very good way. Not overly complex, but a nice straightforward hppy, IPA. When I think West Coast IPA, this is what I am thinkin.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium body. Crisp and clean. Beautiful carbonation.  Drinkability: This brew is extremely drinkable. It is a hoppy beer, but as far as IPAs go, it isn't too hoppy. I could drink the whole six pack tonight (my wife would hate me though). The only reason why it doesn't score higher is that I just feel there is a lack of complexity in this beer.

140,1904,Brad007,4.35,"2007 edition here.  Pours a very nice amber color with a thick, ample head. Aroma is strong and hoppy, an invitation to drink. Floral as well and with even a bit of spice. Taste starts out smooth and malty upfront with a very subtle bitterness in the back. Biscuity and dry at the back of the throat. A second sip confirms much of the same. Very nicely balanced and with some aging, will mellow. Might pick up another bottle just to age it.  Very nice.

You can really smell the citrus and floral scents.  The first thing that jumped out at me when I tasted it, was the citrus flavor, kind of like a grapefruit. Then the floral kicked in a little after.  It has a chewy, full body feel in your mouth. It is really smooth.  Overall, I was really suprised when I tasted the beer. I liked it very much.

140,1904,shererjt,3.62,"2007 vintage 12 oz bottle served in a pint glass.  Poured a clear, medium copper color. Highly carbonated with a great, rocky head. Overwhelming cascade nose--classic resiny grapefruit. Just enough malt--the caramel shined through--to keep it together. Smelled very similar to Liberty Ale; I don't know if they were served side-by-side that I could tell them apart. Medium body and very, very hoppy in both the bitterness and flavor respects. Could have used a bit more sweetness. Some caramel is there, as is some earthiness and fruit. Mouthfeel was hard to appreciate with the massive hop presence, and the drinkabilty was okay but this was a little over-the-top for me.  Not your typical winter beer. Hop lovers, rejoice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Bleedingshrimp,4.15,"One of the original hop bombs. Pours amber with ruby highlights, inch of head fades leaving. Aroma is grapefruit. Taste is all grapefruit with floral notes.

140,1904,treehugger02010,3.49,"I just bought a case of this from Kunda Bev. In King of Prussia, Pa. I poured it into a pint glass. Appearance: When I first poured it, the body was a strong ruby color, but as the liquid left through the hole in the top, the body slowly to an orange color. The head was massive and fluffy with a very very very light tan color. The retention was better than average, but not awesome and the abundant lacing that stuck to the side of the glass was in pretty even and noticeable one inch layers. Smell: The aroma didnt have much depth. I didnt find any malt presence, and I got a moderate smell of American west coast floral or piney hops. Taste: Sadly, in each sip, the first half of my tongue only sensed water. On the back half I received a ton of that same piney or floral hop characteristic. There was a strong malt backbone that I really appreciated because you only notice it when you look for it, but nonetheless it was the only reason the hop character was able to say there. Mouthfeel: Spot on for an American IPA. It was very rigid, letting you know Hey Im an IPA! Drinkability: This is certainly a great beer, but it did leave a lingering taste for a long time.

M - a medium bodied beer. Not too much foamy feel. Goes down easy and I could drink this all night. A lil bit of dryness in the aftertaste, but not in a bad way.

Some citrus gives way to a sugary fruity sweetness momentarily, followed by a spicy hop bitterness. Finish is surprisingly clean.  M - Nice feel. Lively carbonation and a body on the heavier side of medium makes this one feel good.  D - Very nice. A geat winter time IPA. Careful with this one, goes down nice and easy.

Really balanced from beginning to end.  M: A treat for the taste buds and mouth as it is sharp bite, invigorating and a slight mellow and oil on the tongue for aftertaste.

The aroma is primarily of ""c"" hops and caramel malt, though it isn't huge and in your face. The taste is quite balanced between the hops and malt as far as west coast IPA's go. Not extremely hoppy like certain others, or extraordinarily complex or really special in any way. There is a lingering aftertaste that includes both the bitterness of the hops and sweetness of the malts.

I always thought that they were just an okay brewery - I always loved the Pale Ale, but I wasn't blown away until I had this and their Harvest Ale.  Poured a 2007 vintage 12oz. bottle into a SN pint glass.  Appearance - It is a golden-orange-caramel color. Completely transparent. It had a one-finger head that slowly dissipated, and left a decent amount of lace throughout the drinking session. There is a slight, but constant, carbonation stream of bubbles that float to the top of the beer.  Smell - I detect notes of lemony citrus and grapefruit at the front of the scent. Right behind those notes, I smell pine and the slightest trace of caramel (malt?).  Taste - This beer is really hoppy. I like it. The inititial flavor is bitter pine, the middle is toasty malt and a hint of caramel sweetness, with hops rounding out the end. This beer is almost in perfect balance, almost. The hops dominate, but that isn't really a bad thing with me.  Mouthfeel - This beer is chrisp. Really crisp. The carbonation level is nearly perfect, and it helps cut through the hoppy bitterness and oily texture. Extremely smooth going down - easy drinking. Light - medium bodied.  Drinkability - Very drinkable. The flavor is great, the mouthfeel is great, and it just leaves me wanting more.  I am going to the store to buy another sixer. I am going to age one of these too. Another fantastic seasonal from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Amidst all the Imperial Stouts, Winter Warmers and Barleywines this exceptional ale is the one I thirst for over the summer months. Not too strong to prohibit your consumption and not too bitter or sweet to turn your nose/tongue. It is in my opinion a perfectly balanced ale (for a hophead) and is one of the few moderate alcohol beers I choose to drink with a fine cigar (usually it's Imperial Stout or Barleywine). I've found it has enough alcohol to allow for storage, I've had some 2 year old examples that were phenomenal, more balanced if you will. Each season I try to squirrel away some in the back of my liquor cabinet but they usually don't make it past the spring.

The Mouthfeel is not superb, and it's somewhat inconsistent. One sip will be intense and full of bitter hops. The next will me smooth, with a touch of hops added toward the end of the sip. Both are nice feels, just when rotating the former catches you off guard with the hops and the latter leaves you wondering when the hops come.  Drinkability is pretty solid; it's under 7% ABV so drinking a couple won't kill you. The hops take away from it just a little, since there is only so much of that [presumably] you [I] can take.

140,1904,Floydster,4.12,12 ounce bottle from A and A Liquor in Westchester  Poured into a frosted mug  I remember this beer being more bitter the first time I had probably because it had just been bottled  8 or 9 months of sitting in my closet really helped this bottle out  It poured a deep amber color and tasted far more sweet than the first time around  Not too thick and malty like most Christmas beers  Worth trying when December rolls around,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,t0rin0,4.53,"Update: I should probably reveiw this new as that's how most people are going to be drinking it. Appearance and body are the same but the hop flavors and aromas are mostly floral with plenty of pine and woodiness. It can be a very nice beer if you drink it within the first month or so from bottling but it can turn into something fun after a few years. It oxidizes in a nice way.  ***  I recently aquired bottles from a number of different years. These include 2006, 2005, 2002, 1999, and 1990. I tried them all this month (August 2007). Believe it or not the bottle from 1990 (almost 17 years old now) was still quite good. It seems to have mellowed more than the 1999 bottle though.  The appearance is as it has always been, a reddish color with a bit of brown in there. Nice color.  The fresher years smell spicy and hoppy but the older they get the sweeter and less hopy they smell. Not necesarily a bad thing, just the malt coming out.  Fresh celebration ale is fairly bitter. It has a very dry aftertaste. The flavor is malty but that is overpowered by the hop flavor, which is not a bad thing. The older they get the more chocolatey and sweet they taste. Its unfortunate that I couldn't try some more years between 1990 and 1999 because the 1999 seems to be the best that ive tried whereas the 1990 seems to have lost a bit of flavor and is most certainly over the hill. If I get to try some more years I'll update this post.  Mouthfeel was the same for all years. Very smooth and thin. That seems to be a characteristic of Sierra Nevada beers.  Drinkability is a tough one to describe. Judge for yourself based on the flavors that ive described.  Overall this is one of my favorite beers of all time (out of the 460 or so that ive tried)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mhaugan,4.08,"2006 edition served in a shaker pint  I hadn't tried any previous editions so this review is based solely on my experience with the latest brew.  Pours a reddish brown with a light head. Reminiscent of tinted SNPA. Slight spicy odor with a hops backer. Tastes quite smooth with the hops popping on the tongue. Finishes with a strong hop bitterness left in the mouth. Despite this, I actually find that the milder upfront hops make this a very drinkable beer for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,wvmi,2.6,"A- Side poured about 1/2 inch head. Good lacing. Rusty red color, slightly hazy.  S- Smelled average. Nothing remarkable, good or bad.  T- Heavy malt at the start. Very piney, acidic. Decent hops finish.  M- not a pleasant feeling. Over carbonated, irritated the back of my tongue and throat. Oily and sort of Nyquil feeling.  D-I won't go looking for this.  The age of this bottle may have affected it's quality. Brewed in November 2006, drank in July 2007.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: Smells of piney hops, not incredibly robust, but nice nevertheless.  T: Malt upfront, but then it relinquishes its hold and allows the hops to shine through. Delicious grapefruit from the West Coast hops dominates the palate leaving a nice lingering aftertaste.  M: Medium-bodied, with a resiny, oily, almost medicinal character from the hops.  D: About as drinkable as an IPA gets, this beer is easy going down and only leaves you wanting more. I had this beer in November, and it was much more raw, the mild aging seems to have mellowed it out a bit, making it more drinkable.

140,1904,kwakwhore,4.1,"2006 bottling. Pours a beautiful copper color with a voluminous cream colored head which leaves lacing down the glass. Grapefruit, citrus in the nose. Flavors start with hops, hops in the middle and hops in the finish. some biscuit malt sneaks through in the middle, but the malt character is muted compared to the hops.

140,1904,HoppyBen,3.78,"This appeared to be a darker, but not truely red IPA. Not overly impressive but not without its charms in color alone. It did provide an inviting appearance with the generation of a smooth and thin head. The nose was unfortunately unimpressive. A bit ""standard"" for an IPA, it was hoppy but no smells came to mind other than ""beer, stronger than fizzy yellow"". Not displeasing in aroma, just not complex. I have to admit, the taste was very pleasant indeed. It stood it's ground in my mouth yet was not overpowering nor diminutive. A light hint of smoke, hoppy and over all pleasant. It unfortunately, leaves a strong aftertaste that lingers longer than some houseguests! The mouth-feel was the true winning quality in this ale. It wasn't thick, nor thin and carbonation was spot on. The overall drinkability was good; I would pair this with a burger or some barbecue anyday. A nice strong cheese or anything salty for that matter would really be a partner to this very drinkable but otherwise undistinguished IPA. Final comments: stronger than the regular Sierra Nevada but don't get overly excited for this celebration.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A nice malt backbone here.  T-More of those Sierra hops. Really good strong hop flavour that is well balanced by the biscuit like malt backbone. This is a hop bomb that is balanced. A great lingering bitterness coats the tongue. This is better fresher but it has held up well.  M-Nice creamy body with a medium low ammount of carbonation. the hop character has a certain oil feel.  D-Sierra Nevada does it right despite their size, this is a great IPA and a wonderful seaonal treat.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Pooba001,4.43,"Beautiful coppery amber shade when poured into pint glass. Terrific head, about a half inch, that stays forever. There's still some left as I finish the beer. Big citrus, herbal, pine/spruce hop aroma in the nose. Very Sierra Nevada, which is good.  There is an understated malt and grain flavor to this, but its only apparent once the initial mouthful of hoppiness subsides. Pretty much what you'd expect from the aroma, there's spice, citrus, a bitter bite, and spruce. Just a terrific beer all around, one of the best non hop-bomb IPAs there is.  Mouthfeel is good, smooth, nice texture, its a definite plus. Drinkability is excellent. I probably drink more of this than any other Winter seasonal beer, and look forward to it every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Not sure if its the type of hop used or just too much but its very bitter on the palate. Good beer but not a real sessionable beer for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Absumaster,3.97,"Thanks to plucier for this beer!  Appearance is a bright brown beer with a small creamy head.  Smell is citric hoppy with some fresh grapefruit whiffs. And a light malty caramel smell.  Taste is bitter with citric notes of lemon and grapefruit. Yeast profile is pretty clean and bitterness is not sharp but rounded. I can't put my finger on the hops that have been used. I thougt it was Amarillo, but in the end I can't determine which hop it is anyway. For me the hops are citric and grapefruity. There is a light sweetness and the beer is a little sticky. Body is medium.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Maerzen,2.33,"I was really surprised when I read the other reviews on this beer so I tried it again and I just can't get past the bitterness. It pours nicely and has a nice color and looks like an enjoyable Christmas/Celebration ale but I was really surprised by the taste. Most holiday ales that I have tasted seem to play with the mixture of spices. It is always fun to try and figure out what the brew master was playing with, and they are never the same. The bitterness is so powerful in this ale that it completely masks any other spice. Sorry, I did try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,shadow1961,4,"I picked up a sixer of Celebration Ale on sale at Essers, and boy, I was sure glad I did. It pours out a finger of fluffy head over a pretty, clear dark amber brew. Carbonation is steady and the nose is citrus and pine hops. The flavor is spicy malt up front with an appetizing piney hop finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and cleansing, the aftertaste is more of a grassy/herbal hop flavor.

Im sure i am in the minority and im willing to try it again. but my vote right now is that this is just too harsh.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Dispite the head issue, its quite a tantalizing picture.  Cascade comes to the nostrols first, with a bit of pine and a light toffee malt.  Damn! Hoppy and resinous with a terrific malt presence. A great balance between big hops and mellow, wonderful sweetness. Feels like a great amber ale mixed with an I.P.A. Lookout-the drinkability is outstanding and the mouthfeel is brilliant.

140,1904,udubdawg,4.35,"12 oz bottle, with the usual festive scene  Pours a pretty coppery orange color. A slight haze, and big frothy white head that retains well. Lacing is fantastic - a thin broken sheet over part of the glass, and a thicker ring with each sip. Hmm, the rings appear to be rather far apart tonite...  Nose is the usual citrus and floral driven hop bomb, with some pine. Already this vintage is living up to the previous versions. A little alcohol is noticeable after this warms. Together the spiciness of these two aspects covers any malt that may be trying to assert itself.  Quite bitter. I remember many years ago how my palate recoiled at this, my first taste of the style. Now I love it. Bready caramel malt makes a cameo appearance before being shoved out of the spotlight by refreshing bitter and sweet citrus flavors. And again this seems spicy, although I know of no spices added to it. Well done! Body is on the full side of medium, and carbonation is pleasantly low. I'm enjoying the lingering bitterness and slight drying finish.  More bitter than many, but drinkability is still very high. A must have for the holidays, and too bad they don't brew this year round. Although it ages better than most IPAs, so why not stock up and enjoy it throughout the year?! I certainly do, and all I have to ""celebrate"" is that the taxes are done.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Patches of fluffy lace cling to the side of the glass  Scent is grapefruit, citrus peel, floral and some bready notes.  Taste is warm and spicey with a hint of sweetness and a fairly strong bready malt presence. Then, of course, there are the hops. Grapefruit, citrus peel, some orange. Some resinous piney flavors come and go. There's a nice hop bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel is silky with slight warming in the throat.  Drinkability seems quite high.  A classic American IPA.

Thick dense off white puffy head, half an inch of dense creaminess. Some patchy lacing  Smell, rich piney american aroma hops, some slight acetone character and a little peppery sweetness. A few slight fruity esters followed by a chunk of maltiness and tinned fruit. Freshness prevails, some lavender and a faint flowery aroma  Taste, crisp slightly syrupy floral hop character. Strong yet balanced hop bitterness, backed up a strong malt backbone. Creamy and silky hops conjure up a myriad of deep rich fragrant flavours, theres almost a perfumy quality to the whole experience also. Lasting citric and piney bitterness on the finish  Superb seasonal IPA. The 2005 seems to be slightly better but then again my palette may just have changed to some degree.

Taste is floral hops up front with the pine following through. Leaves a very dry, bitter taste. Not enough citrus hops for me. Not unlike GD's Titan IPA, IMO. Good IPA but I am not sure I understand the very high ratings on this one other than it being a seasonal/limited release.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A hop head's dream. Very flavorful.  M: Medium bodied and grainy. Smoother than it would appear given its carbonation.  D: A good change of pace from all the typical malty, spicy winter brews.

140,1904,johnnybravo,2.15,"Although not even exceptionally hoppy I think this beers is still too bitter, too dry. Especially in the finish it developes a harsh bitterness, almost medicinal.

The aroma is surprisingly sweet. Hops are evident - citric, floral, and piney; a little swirl brings it out even more. It doesn't taste as sweet as I assumed it would, but the hops are spot on. The bitterness is satisfying and not the least overpowering. Almost too easy to drink, it's refreshing and addictive.

140,1904,kpantz,3.95,"Executive Summary: This is extraction of hop aroma, flavor and bitterness at its finest. Great three-pronged attack on this one.  2006 Edition. 12 oz. bottle  Appearance: Crystal clear amber pour with a fluffy white head that starts at about 2 fingers thick and slowly recedes from there. Wonderful lacing down the side of my pint glass.  Smell: Grassy, piney hops. Some malt backbone in the nose, but let's be honest, this beer isn't about malt.  Taste: Minor sweetness at the outset, but it's quickly erased by a fabulous piney hop flavor that itself is eventually obliterated by a lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel: A little thinner than I had expected, and the carbonation level is a little high for my liking. A little sticky after the sip has left your mouth.  Drinkability: High. Quite high. This is my kind of session beer. I might mix it up with a few darker or maltier holiday offerings, but this is a good one on which to fall back.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Sweet caramel malt wave takes over to balance this brew out perfectly. Hops show up again and then the beer finishes with a clean christmas spice.  M: Smooth and creamy. Medium carbonation.

A nice bitter hop after-bite takes the brew on down into the stomach where the alcohol warming is finally perceived.  Good mouthfeel and drinkability. A classic winter-type IPA and very tasty.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,EVLguy,4.27,"I really don't understand why a brewery would only release this beer once a year, and over winter for that matter as this tastes like the perfect hot weather IPA. Anyway, onto the review.  Appearance: a dark brownish orange and clear. The head was about one finger or more after pouring and slowly turned to a thin white cap of suds.  Smell: Piney, and even slightly earthy hops. It exhibits a depth of aroma not usually present in IPAs. Unfortunately it's too faint to really pick up on, still, it is kind of alluring.  Taste: That's good hops, crisp and bitter, but not overpowering. After a few sips of this you'll hardly notice a sting from the hops. Flavors of pine and even citrus are there, but to be honest distinct flavors aren't what makes this beer great. It's way you want to pick it up again for another quick sip.  Mouthfeel: The body is a little light, but overall it's very well balanced. Medium carbonation and acidity.

If you're not into hoppy, bitter beers. This is probably not for you. Other than that, I can taste a twinge of grapefruit and orange. But, hops are the main feature.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer has a light feel to it and goes down easily. I can and do session this beer. Personally, I think this is Sierra Nevada's best beer.

Anyway, the 2006 version pours an unfiltered, lightly carbonated amber/bronze, with a finger of tannish head that leaves light lacing, eventually reducing to almost nothing. It's aroma consists of pulpy orange and grapefruit, with toasted malts and notes of solvent alcohol. On the palate there is bitter white grapefruit, pine, apricot, lime?, toasted/caramel malts, and some heat. The body is medium, with coating, almost numbing hop oils, and it leaves a long, citric finish. More fruity and citric this time around, along with more evident alcohol - this one needs some time to cool down - I've got two bottles for cellaring purposes so we'll hope it improves some age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Every sip leaves a perfect ring of foam that form a beautiful concentric column down the glass to the very last sip, very nice. The aroma is nice and floral but a tad light. The taste is really great, a fantastic IPA. The aroma and bittering hops are very well balanced, and there is an appropriate level of malt that avoids being too sweet or sticky. Lots of citrusy cascade hops with some breadiness and honey to it. The mouthfeel is phenomenal. This is so luscious and creamy, with a moderate light body. The drinkability is through the roof for an IPA, there is no hint of the ABV and it is incredibly smooth overall. Sierra Nevada really should make this a year round release.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,perfectkaos,4.2,"Look forward to this every year. This review comes from the 2006 bottling.  Beer pours a reddish amber color with almost no head--just a little foam ring around the top. You can smell the hops, but they aren't overpowering.  You can really taste the hop bite in this one, with just a little bit of sweet malts. The alcohol is barely detectable.  This is an awesome example of an American IPA not overly hoppy but crisp and dry. It's just a pity that this is Sierra's winter beer and not available all the time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,theopholis,4.32,"Appearance - Clear amber with a failry fluffy 2-finger head. Looks like it has some staying power. Just a little lace.  Aroma - Nothing that overwhelms you. A nice mix of malt sweetness and hops with a hint of citrus and pine. Smells very clean and crisp.  Taste - A big hoppy taste that the malt sweetness can't quite hide behind. Deliscious. Can really taste the hops in your jowels and on the back of your toungue. Just a hint of alcohol.  Mouthfeel - Light to medium body for the style. The finish is just a tad dry, which is unusual, but not particularly unpleasant. The carbonation level is right on for bringing out the nice hop flavors without killing your taste-buds.  Drinakbility - I love it, but if you're not a hop-head, you will probably find it a little over-powering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ClockworkOrange,4.1,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my pint glass. Appears a mildly cloudy, golden amber color with two fingers of dense, off white head. Smells of malted grains and citusy hops. Tastes of lemon, pine needles, resinous hops. Bitter and dry finish being moderate both in body and carbonation. This is a classic American IPA. One that I look forward to every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,pmcadamis,4.37,"A - Honey amber clear ale with a nice fluffy three finger head. Tons of thick and sticky lace is left on the glass.  S - Hoppy citrus and pine aroma. Orange peel. Other citus juices and some very faint hints of winter spice. Canned mandarin oranges.  T - Big hoppy citrus flavor. Lime rind, orange peel, and alot of sappy pine needle flavors. Tastes like a souped up version of SN's pale ale. I can taste a litle hint of spice in the aftertaste. Brittle toffee malt flavors come out more as the beer warms and your palate adjusts to the hop bitterness.  M - Light to medium bodied with a dry finish. The lively carbonation goes extremely well with the zesty citrus rind flavors!  D - Excellent! A hop-head's delight. I really don't see how this is much of a winter beer (I usually think of malty caramel and toffee flavors with cinnamon and spice when I think of winter brews), but it's really good regardless of the season!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,brewcrew76,3.68,2006 Vintage  A - Pours a slightly hazy copper with a 2 finger white head and a nice coating of lacing down the side of the glass.  S - Somewhat faint spicy pine and citrus hops.  T - Spicy pine and citrus hops with a sweet malt middle and nice dry finish.  M - Medium bodied and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation.  D - Not as hoppy as I remember previous versions but still a very nice easy drinking IPA.  Note - Sampled the 2006 along with a vertical of the 2004 and 2005. The 2004 has taken on a Barleywine like quality with time. Still tasty with some noticeable hop character but very barleywine like. The 2005 has more citrus than I get in the 2006 and is still a nice tasting IPA after a year. I would probably give the 2005 4's across the board.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Talisker,4.22,"2006 edition, 12oz bottle from six pack.  A superbly balanced straightforward American-style IPA - shouldn't be compared to holiday spice winter warmer seasonals that come out around the same time.  Color a nice brownish orange, slightlyazy. Moderate head. Nose is magnificent - a beautiful combination of American hops followed by the right amount of malt. Taste from this bottle is a bit dull compared to others from this vintage - might be oxidation - but still rich.  Not too much of anything, but certainly enough of everything. This beer does everything right. It's just on the edge of session-ability. I wish it were brewed year round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,magget,4.4,Poured a 12 oz. bottle with rustic amber color into a stemmed Ommegang glass. Can't wait to sip one of my favorites.  Smelled of piny hops and sweet malts.  Taste is very hoppy and rich with the perfect balance of sweet malts. Pretty high carbonation that tickles the pallet. Very nice.  Not very thick but plenty of body that is very exclusive to the IPA style. Has a very aggresive hop character for a single IPA and definitly sticks out as one of the more notable IPA's i've ever had. Also very yummy on tap. Peace...,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,markgugs,4.7,"poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter glass  A: pours a tantalizing looking copper cranberry color with very little cream-shaded head and minor lacing.  S: hops, hops & more hops, you know what's coming with this one, significant citrusy grapefruit scents  T: ...and there are the hops. Massive & in your face, just like Sierra is known to do, thankfully I'm drinking one of the ""fixed"" Celebrations, after the recipe was corrected for 2006. Loads of juicy west coast grapefruit hops and a bitter, clean finish that lingers for quite some time. Love it.  M: a perfectly balanced medium-bodied ale, that both quenches and dries your mouth out. Lively carbonation reminds you of the beer's signature feel.  D: I've definitely overdone it on Celebration Ales before, so that to me makes this a dangerously drinkable beer, especially if the hophead in you is clamoring to get out for a night.  Excellent beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,oakbluff,4.2,2006 vintage. Pours a clear ruby red. Good lacing on side of pint glass. Taste is fruity and quite carbonated. The malt backbone is very solid and keeps the hops under control. Excellent mouthfeel and has the distinct Sierra Nevada taste. Dry finish. Excellent beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MusicmanSD,4.05,"Love the little snow covered cabin! Had my first run in with this beer at the beguinning of its 2006 brew life. It looks damn good on the pour, a very deep and rich golden color with a pilsner amount of carbonation and bright white head. The smell is all hops up front, a good sign for an IPA. In fact, I'd consider this a double IPA beer. The taste is very ""in your face"" like a Stone IPA has, but a little more of the hops oily charachter pulls thru compared to the raw bitterness. The mouthfeel is very heavy, although carbonated and damn bitter. I defintely can't see myself drinking more that three of these before being overwhelmed and at loss of a palate by the end of the night (not to mention somewhat drunk...haha), these baby's will do it, although it might be hard to stomach for those weak to hops! Recommended if your a hop head looking for something a little less agressive, but still has a punch.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,scaliasux,3.23,"Appearance - Clear rusty brown. Thick off-white foamy head is quite persistant.  Smell - Floral hops dominates.  Taste - Flavor also dominated by citrus/floral hoppiness. Quite bitter. Malt is present, but rather indistinct.  Mouthfeel - Body appears light, crisp.  Drinkability - Good example of style. Not one of my favorites though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,rallison,4.13,"All around, one solid IPA!  A: Wonderful amber color with an inch thick white head that sticks around for the whole glass (of course it doesn't stay an inch thick the whole time).  S: Nice and floral, you are definitely expecting some hops in this one.  T: Excellent floral hops, not overly bitter, followed by some sweetness. First few bottle I had seemed to have a bit of a medicinal/metallic taste, but that seemed to go away by serving it a bit warmer.  M: Medium body, just feels good going down.  D: Easy to session this one - can't think of much that would be better to devote a night to.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,lehows,4.08,"Had a 2006 and it poured a dark reddish amber color with a creamy off-white head and wonderful lacing. Aromas of sharp citrus hops, pine, some dough as well a malty background. Complex flavors of mostly bitter refreshing hops. Citrusy grapefruit and spicy pine but with a distinct malt backbone that I enjoyed very much. Full mouthfeel. Can't wait to try this on tap next time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JudgeRoughneck,3.45,"This beer sports a thin pistachio head and leaves an interesting looking sticky lace. It is a clear, light rust color. The nose is resinous, piney, earthy, and all around pretty light.  The taste is of course hoppy. Spicey hop flavors dominate, backed by floral flavors. This is over an almost transparent malt background. Bitterness turns a tad salty with warmth. This is pretty light for an IPA and I might even go so far as to call it watery. If you are looking for some straight hop juice, this is your beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Atlas1,3.76,"This 2006 SNCA poured into a belgian-style snifter glass. Probably not the most appropriate glass for the occasion, but I wanted to see if I could capture as much of the aroma as possible. A nice burnt-orange-amber color from the pour, with a nice looking inch high head on top. Leaves a relatively thin and disconnected, but noticeable, lace along the glass as the beer recedes. The head then settles down as a nice thin cover over the entire beer, with its edges clinging to the glass. There is also a tuft of foam which comes to rest in the middle of the glass. I find this quality reminiscent of several belgian ales I've had before; it's nice to see.  The aroma is malty, but with clear notes of unknown spice and even a citrus/ginger-like faintness to it. I can't tell the spices in this. Maybe some cinammon? I'm not entirely sure. (Admittedly, I'm getting over a week-long head cold and my olfactory senses are not yet back up to snuff... pardon the pun.) But the taste of the SNCA is fierce and unexpected. There is an almost peppery hoppiness to this beer. The hops are in complete control here, and are most noticeable, as usual, in the finish. Some tart citrus in there as well, and a hint of fresh pine. This is not the usual spicey flavor that I (mistakenly?) associate with winter brews, and I like it very much. There is also a subtle sweetness that settles in quietly under the tongue.  I wouldn't sit down for a session with the SNCA, but I could see having one or two of these after dinner sitting around a fire on a cold winter night. Sounds cliched, perhaps, but this beer is anything but cliched. A solid outing by the gang at Sierra Nevada once again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Georgiabeer,4.42,Pours a nice amber with a pretty healthy head that both sticks around and leaves some good lacing. The smell is both sharp with spicy citrusy hops and has a nicemalt background. The taste has hops up front and deep flavors of dark fruit. Grapefruit pith makes a pretty strong appearance as well. Mouthfeel is well balanced with good carbonation and a fairly full body without being heavy. This beer is a treat when it comes out every year. A very well balanced ipa that is best when fresh and from a store that has kept it refrigerated. I think it is particularly good this year.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Caesar1pup,4.6,"Brilliant! Top Notch! Oh how I will look forward to this every winter now as I look forward to pumpkin ale in the fall.  How do I love thee?

140,1904,Melchizedek,3.96,"Pours with an enthusiastic billowy beigish head that sticks and holds fast as a beautiful cap. Body is deep amber.  Aroma is lots of hop. Pretty resiny all around, a hint of citrus/grapefruit. Much more well-balanced in the mouth, a bit dry, with grainy malts over against refreshing bitterness, some apple skin, and a little underlying yeast going on. A little drying in the finish.  This stuff is very, very drinkable for a well-hopped IPA. It's a lovely winter tradition, and I'll make a point of doing some comparative review as the years go by.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jdg204,4.2,Caught a 6 Pack of the 2006 version just before the end of the Holiday season and I was very glad I got the chance.  Appearance - Lovely amber/bronze color with a fantastic beige head.  Smell - Very nice spicey/sweet smell.  Taste - Great to have a Holiday IPA! Wonderful hops flavor which is well complimented by subtle sweet malts. The hops are very unique and have a nice bitter feel that sticks.  Mouthfeel - Nice consistent texture and the hops leaves a nice biting aftertaste.  Drinkability - I really enjoyed this IPA and think Sierra Nevada has produced a unique/fantastic Holiday offering. This is a very nice sipping beer and the hops really stand out. I look forward to adding this to future holidays.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mcallister,4.29,"2006 Sierra Nevada Celebration ale courtesy of bierguy5.  An amber shade with reddish sparkles and a small dirty white head leaves thin lace around the glass and large bubbles of foam retent themselves nicely.  Sweet citrusy smelling hops are quite the showstopper. Hints of pine and floral hop aspects also. A nice caramel malt underlies the hop. Grapefruit, nectarine, apricot, and peach fill out the other aromatic esters.  First thing that stands out are the boldness, resiny hops. Big and bad and in your face, yet very well balanced and not palate fatiguing. The malt is rich and thick and leaves a creamy mid palate. Flavors of flowers, licorice, melon, apricot, and peach round out the taste. Drinkability is basically all day.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ultralarry2006,4.6,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Leaves a one finger, tan colored head with excellent retention, and excellent lacing. Body is a nearly clear, bright copper. This is beautiful to behold.  Smell - citrus, lemons, and floral odors fill the nose immediately, followed by toasty malt biscuits. The floral and citrus perfume continue to intoxicate and enchant. Mouthwatering.  Taste - exactly as promised by the nose. Citrusy, floral hops dominate over a yummy toasty malt backbone. There is a lemony hop twang on the finish. It's that simple, yet so hearty and spicy and delicious.  Mouthfeel - medium bodied, smooth, and much hop oil slickness.  Drinkability - this is excellent ale, and I think it's entirely very sessionable ( it's just under my sessionabilty abv limit of 7% ). I always look foward to having this every winter, and it always goes over well, even with those who've never had an IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mnj21655,4.25,"Pours a nice copper color gold slight gold hues. Nice slightly off white 2 finger head with tons of lacing. Smells predominantly of piney hops but citrusy and, to a lesser extent, floral hops are also present. Taste is all piney hops. I couldn't pick up any malt at all in the flavor. Nice mouthfeel, just shy of medium body, and a nice amount of carbonation. As for drinkability this is great. Despite the complete dominance of the hops I would have no problem drinking a few more of these (after all this is an IPA).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,treedoctor5002,4.25,This beer pours a beautiful copper color. A nice cream head pops up perfectly in my glass and then disappears. Not as full bodied as other IPA's I've seen. Aroma is pure sweet hoppiness and fruity also. This thing is loaded with hops. Seems like an upgrade of their pale ale. Really sweet and full of pineapple flavor. The hops certainly balance it out nice. It's different than any seasonal I've ever had. I love the concept of an IPA seasonal though. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky. If your into IPA's this one is a must try.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,maundythirsty,3.98,"Coppery, bubbleless beer, but it sprouts a tall, white, rocky, tiny-bubbled head. Laces thick. Smells of spicy hops, with a light honey touch.  Strong evergreen hop flavor, with more spiciness. Tangy, bitter kick and alcohol bite. Solid medium mouthfeel with sparky carbonation.  Very attractive, aggressive, spicy beer. An excellent holiday choice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PEBKAC,3.14,"A sticky head tops off a pour as dark as black tea, but light enough to still dig out that elusive pistachio shell that flicked in from across the table.  It takes a good 7-8 minutes for everything to settle, so I began to get lost in watching each individual bubble rise to glory, only to be sucked into the mist. By this time, the glass looks really dirty with all the eratic lacing. The top is murky & cloudy like pond scum, but I think the dragon flies might of went in for a dip ahead of time.  Sticky hops tickle your nose, all within the fresh, mossy subterfuge of a standard pint glass.  The first taste bestows lots of pine, spicy hops, & an overall bitterness that is stronger then I last remember. Ribs are great with this. :D Wet & musty, it cuts like mouthwash. SN always seems to have just a bit extra carbonation in their bottles.  The aftertaste leaves a trail of saltine crackers & scratchy bitterness from the tip of your tounge, all the way to your tonsils(hanging on for dear life).  With a large meal, an extra pour is never out of the question. It is quite warming, with the carbonation influencing the alcohol.  A good value, a good brew. :)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,number1bum,4.33,"Pours a beautiful copperish amber with a nice foamy tan head. Very lively carbonation and nice head retention and lacing. Smells slightly sweet but mostly hoppy, with some citrus. Taste is lots of hops up front, followed by some malt sweetness and finishing dry and bitter. Really nicely balanced and the lingering bitter finish is not at all unpleasant. This is really a nice IPA; too bad it's just a seasonal. I will certainly look for it and enjoy it every holiday season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dickroop,4.45,"It's reputation goes before it, so when I spied some, I grabbed! I ignored the price, and I bring them out once in a while to celebrate a good day.... like today.  It poured clear and coppery and quite bubbly. It was 1-finger frothy, a beige head that lasted longer than most and left extraordinarily generous coating and lacing. In short, it looked great.  It gave off a promising nose of citrus and grapefruity hops. The taste gave a good hop hit but with a sweet, mellow malt presence, resolving to a good bitter finish. This brew has IBUs to spare and then some, very solid and oh-so definitely in the IPA camp. After that it was just simple ale goodness, so well balanced that you can enjoy bitterness and sweetness all together. There is an alcohol flavor that came through toward the end of the glass, and a little graininess, but neither detracted.  Mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied with a nutty astringency. Pure pleasure. Were it not for the 6.8% abv, one would want to just sit drink one after another. Recommended, emphatically.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GimmeAles,2.89,"Crystal clear orange develops massive, semi rocky, cream-colored head that recedes, but hangs around leaving some decent lacing.  Faint metal-tinged grain dominates the nose. Leafy-herbal notes detected as well but not a lot going on here.  Tastes of zesty orange pith with very faint candy sweetness in the back. Hops are very upfront, leafy and astringent. Fleeting floral (rose) character. Warming produces a slightly increase of malty-sweetness and alcohol vapor, but flavor seems to showcase a coarse hop profile.  Astringency is heightened by prickly carbonation which only adds harshness  mouthfeel suffers accordingly. Decanting from a secondary vessel improves the smoothness, but a lingering mineral-harshness remains.  A classic thats oft raved about, but nothing special to me. Certainly fresh and made to high standards with good ingredients - just not a combination that really works from the bottle least.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RedBaron,4.45,"(An update from my last sample from 1/11/2007 - a little over a year ago!)  Kudos to BA Marcobrau for giving me a six-pack of the 2007 version of SNCA. Always a delight to try the annual incarnation of a classic American winter ale.  Appearance: Pacific setting sun orange-red; Mostly translucent, good un-even head Smell: Wonderfully floral, aromatic piney hop nose. I can smell the Cascades before I even pour the brew into my glass! Taste: Simply a beautiful balance of bready, biscuit malt with a large amount of bittering hops, with citrus notes. Finishes as it should: dry as the Illinois prairie on a bitterly cold January evening. Mouthfeel: Really, the hops win out here. That's a good thing though I wish there was just a bit more ""umpf"" in the malt's presence (i.e. a tad more sweetness). That said, this beer is what it is...a winter pleasure to treasure. Drinkability: Damn! Every year, they the slightly alter this beer, but they always bring out the best possible rendition. This year is no exception. Seek it out while you can. It's probably off the shelves as I write this (Jan. 24th), because they release it around Thanksgiving (methinks that date is a bit early). Anyway, those in the frigid climes of the Midwest will appreciate this beer after walking their dog through subzero temps, and frozen snow and ice everywhere. This is THE beer to take the edge off that walk, my friends. Merci, moi frere Monsieur Marcobrau.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cameraman,2.93,"The 2006 edition of celebration ale, it pours a deep amber color. There are visible signs of carbonation, with a quater inch off white colored head forming. The aroma has a slight citrusy scent, but surprisingly a strong malt aroma is very dominant. That malt starts the flavor off, and then midway, the citrusy hop flavors become present and linger on the palate long after the beer has passed by. A medium bodied feel, that slowly thins out as it reaches it finally destination, my stomach. This was disappointing, SNCA, to me the standard for being a hop monster beer. Perhaps, my expectations were high, it just seems it falls short.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mithrascruor,4.3,"12 oz. bottle poured into a mug.  Appearance: Pours a nice clear amber color with a 1+ in. foamy off-white head. Leaves a lacing on the glass.  Smell: Has an aroma of hops and citrus, but sweeter than a typical pale ale. Some floral hints are present as well.  Taste: The taste has two main separated flavors: the bitter hops and lemon, and the sweeter florals (rose) and citrus (grapefruit). The two flavors switch off, eventually finishing with the sweet which gradually segues into the bitter aftertaste. Quite unique.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and smooth, yet with a somewhat grainy feel.  Drinkability: Goes down well and the alcohol content seems just right -- can definitely enjoy a few of these in a row.  Though I find it to be an enjoyable and unique beer, given the distinct hop flavors I can't shake the feeling that this is just a gimmick (or seasonal treat... if you're less cynical than I am) based upon their Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Of course, if you like that beer this is definitely worth a try! And on it's own it's worth a shot as well. I think that I'll limit myself to just this 6-pack, though -- after you've tried it, you might find it a bit pointless to try again. If I want a pale ale, I'll get one -- and if I want a spicier, sweeter beer, I'll get one. I don't really need them combined.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RedChrome,3.95,"A medium colored clear amber beer. Two inch high almond colored head took a long time to settle down. Lots of tiny carbonation bubbles slowly rising to the top. Clingy lacing coats glass.  A decent floral hops aroma. There is also a very distinct notice of citric aroma in the blend. This is a very pleasent aroma in the nose, but doesn't have the overall strength to make it great.  A bitter hops taste. There is a light pine taste up front that holds as the other flavors develop behind it. Interesting floral sense shifts around the back of the tonge. Nice flavor.  An average thickness and a small burst of carbonation in the mouth make for only a slightly above average feel.  Overall a worthy effort. Great beer to enjoy with a piece of galic grilled chicken and roasted potatos. A decent offering to enjoy while it is availiable. Not my favorite in style overall but as a seasonal, it is worth waiting for.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Graebner,4.55,"Pours a dark coppery brown with a finger of off-white head that dies quickly. Beautiful bottle artwork, too.  Smells of rosewater, pine, citrus rind, lots of hops.  Taste is awesome. Loads of hops, but plenty of other niceties, too. Rose, grapefruit, coffee? some floral hops, and a light maltiness. Alcohol barely noticable. Finishes with a grapefruit-like bitterness.  Mouthfeel is perfection. Creamy and smooth, with a bit of oiliness in there and a slightly higher viscosity than say, their Pale Ale. Light and dry finish with some bitterness.  Overall, something you could drink for a long time. The abv would get to you eventually, but it sure is hard to tell its anywhere over 5% when youre just drinking it.

M - A tad thick for the style, but very nicely carbed.  D - A let-down to be sure. I probably won't buy it again. It wasn't bad, but there was nothing to denote it as a ""Celebration"" beer, and as an IPA, it wasn't spectacular.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The head was about 1/4 inch thick upon pouring and settled to a ring lining the inside of the glass and a nice film layer on the surface about a minute after being poured. Fairly nice lacing. Aromas of malt, floral hops, and fruit such as orange, grapefruit, and lemon are present. Not much else smell wise. The hop flavor along with some grapefruit immediately hits the palate upon taking a sip and linger in the aftertaste as well. The hop bitterness and grapefruit taste is followed by some malty sweetnes. The aftertaste is also a bit dry and bitter, and almost seems slightly salty as well. Has a nice, fullbodied mouthfeel that is also crisp and creamy with moderate carbonation. Fairly easy to drink. This is a good brew indeed, but after hearing many people rave about how great they think it is, I was expecting better. Worth a try though. I'd drink this again.

As time goes on, the taste turns very metallic.  M - Makes my tonge feel swollen, as if it is filling my entire mouth.  D - The initial flavors rated a 3.5, but as it wore on, it became a 2.

Not much going on in the front of the palate, but once the liquid migrates to the back of the palate, you get an explosion of hop flavors, mostly citrus grapefruit and some pine and a little caramel malt. Leaves you with a lingering bitter aftertaste that invites you to have some more.  The carbonation is a little spicy at first, but once it sits for a little it is quite oily and creamy. Nice overall.  I could have and have had quite a few of these in a sitting. Not balanced by any means, the hops dominate this one, but it is quite good none the less.

140,1904,TechMyst,3,"Definitely not the Holy Grail I was expecting. How is this an IPA again? Ok, they got away with adding spices to a PA and it still tastes decent; I'll give them that. This, to me, (2006-07) had a red apple flavor, with some hard conditioning. This is better than any winter brew I can think of at the moment, but again; not something I would put high on my overall list...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beeragent,4.13,"2006 Edition. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a dark orange, with a creamy 1 inch head, leaving decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is all hops on this one, with a hint of citrus. The taste is crisp, sweet citrus, and lots of hops. The mouthfeel is light and easy. This is a very easy beer to drink, and a great beer to have a few of during a session. Another great brew from Sierra Nevada!  2002 Edition, opened on 3/3/07. The beer poured a dark copper, forming a 1 inch thick head, that left light lacing on the glass. The aroma is light citrus, with an equal amount of caramel. The flavor is not as hoppy, having very little citrus flavor, but with alot more caramel notes. A bit odd, but I guess thats what happens when it ages. Medium mouthfeel, but with a smoother finish. Its hard to say which I prefer, the aged or the fresh. Either way, this is still one of my favorites from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ZimZamZoom,4,"2006 vintage. 12 Oz. Twisty poured into a pint glass.  This IPA pours a pretty copper color with a nice thick white head. The head dies slowly and leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  Smell is of citrusy hops, malt, and alcohol. Taste is citrusy with a long bitter hop and alcohol finish.  Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. A nice drinkable IPA that will certainly get better with some age.  Updated with 2008 vintage:  12 oz. bottle, sanitized hotel glass. I'm going to have to start traveling with my own glassware.  A slightly chill-hazed amber color, tight light tan head that leaves radical lacing. Plenty of bubbles.  This American IPA is big on piney hops, but is not at all one-dimensional. Aroma is citrus and pine together with some caramel and sweet malt behind it. Tastes of big pine hops, an evening stroll through a damp pine-forest. Natural and complex. Aftertaste turns citrusy, bitter long grapefruit finish. Not a big malt balance here. There is a uniqueness to the hopping that makes this interesting and different from many IPAs.  Nice medium bodied beer, smooth and significant in the mouth. Mild carbonation burn in the back of the throat. Drinkable? You bet!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,EmilNoldSinclair,4.2,"A very nice IPA to be sure! It has a copperish-reddish translucent color, with a fluffy head that retains well. The smell is dominated by the hops: piney and citrusy. The taste is again dominated by the hops - not too too bitter, but the piney hops come through along with a little grapefruity citrus and a flowery taste, rounded out by the esters that give it a nice medium body. Flavorful, but not as dominating as other American IPAs. Definitely a step up from Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. Nice carbonation, very enjoyable. I'd love to celebrate with this beer again!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CH3CH2OH,3.7,"A rich antique gold, perfectly clear, with a fairly resilient white head. A faint whiff of lemon and spice. Assertive hop bitterness with malt coming out in the middle, leaving with a slight bite of CO2. Medium mouthfeel. Not the most drinkable, in part because the hop bitterness is a bit raw rather than the multilayerd bitterness you get out of other IPAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,uncle8gil,4.61,"My favorite of any Christmas brews. This beer screams of warm chestnuts and under-afghan-cuddling with a loved one. Drink a glass or two and watch 'it's a wonderful life'. You'll be teary-eyed by the end, I guarantee. A beautiful beer to look at poured: a deep, amber-brown, reflecting the light shades like her dirty blonde hair used to. upon first sip the spicy taste explodes throughout the mouth followed instantly by that Sierra Nevada bitter kick, stronger this time than in the pale ale or porter, but balanced perfectly by a fuller body and stronger taste. The finish is wonderful and leaves me wanting another. Season's greetings, friends.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,StarSAELS,4.35,"If you want to know what it looked like, smelled like and tasted like, keep reading the reviews. I had to travel 600 miles to Bonita Springs, FL to find this in a liquor store that used to have a fine selection of brews.  As far as pale ales go, this one is at the top of my list. Excellent taste; it seems similar to their ""standard issue"" pale ale, although with more hops and subtle spices... and more alcohol.  As far as seasonal brews, why is this a seasonal? I'd drink this more often if I could find it more often. I think it knocks the label off the SweetWater Festive, which seems a bit dull this year.  Overall, this is MY pick for the winter brew of the season.

140,1904,Kendo,4.38,"Just like every year, as soon as it came out I bought a case of the 2006 vintage; it says it was bottled on 10/18/06.  A: Clear copper with slight orange hues underneath and a small but strong slightly off-white head that left a good deal of lacing as I drank my way down the pint glass.  S: Hops -- predominantly piney hops but a tad bit of citrusy hops as well.  T: Hops once again -- piney/sprucey hops dominate; my tastebuds are overwhelmed by the hops and as a result, I don't really sense any malt flavors in the profile. Whenever I have my first Celebration (usually at some point in November of each year), I immediately think ""Christmas Tree."" Some citrusy hop flavors -- mainly grapefruit -- are evident as well, but to me this beer tastes mainly like a Colorado Blue Spruce. A peppery spice is there too, however, and it finishes cleanly with a dry, almost metallic zing to it. Nice.  M: Light-to-medium bodied and good levels of carbonation give this one a nice overall feel to it.  D: Highly drinkable (which is one reason I buy it by the case each year). I remember a few nights at St. Andrews Pub in NYC when I enjoyed multiple imperial pints of this on tap and regretted it the next day (at 6.8% ABV it's slightly stronger than your average beer).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Excellent sticky lacing.  Smell: Grapefruit and sweet citrus. Very hoppy.  Taste: Piney hops up front followed by mild caramel malt in the middle and ending with bitter grapefruit. Aftertaste is hoppy bitterness than lingers. Hops through and through. Good stuff.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Goes down very smooth.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. You could knock back several of these without any problem.  Overall: Excellent IPA overall. You'll be hard pressed to find a better all around American IPA.

Very strong bitter citrus with some hops and malt thrown in. Very bitter finish, in a nice way. Nice bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Not too heavy nor too light. Just about right. A slight oily residue from the hops I would imagine.  Drinkability: Quite high. I could see myself enjoying a number of these over a sitting. Too bad I only snagged one to give it a try.

140,1904,AltBock,3.38,"12 oz. stubby bottle that was the 2006 edition. The bottle has a beautiful Christmas style label of a log cabin located in the Sierra Nevada Mountain range. The log cabin is covered with at least 2 feet of snow on the roof and on the ground. It looks like the people of the cabin aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Sierra Nevada put some Christmas Poinsettias around the outer part of the label. To the right of the label is the Government warning and some kind of bottle number above the barcode. The vintage date can be found on the top neck label. The outer part of this small label is lined with the same Christmas Poinsettias that can be found on the main label. The small neck label only has a sentence about the brewing tradition of this kind of beer. No bottle opener needed for this beer, it has a twist off cap.  Appearance: When poured into a Bell's Brewery standard pint glass, the beer is a clear light amber color with a white bubbly skim of foam at the top. It had good retention by leaving behind plenty of foamy rings and white lace around the glass. The head of foam almost remained the entire duration of drinking this beer. It reminded me a bit of all that snow on the snow covered cabin that was on label.  Smell: I really got a whiff of bitter citrus hops when I first poured it. When it settled, the bitter citrus hops were still the main focus of the aroma, but behind it was just the slightest aroma of caramel malts in the background. If there was anything else, the citrus hops covered it all up. To me it was really just a one dimensional aroma.  Taste: The taste was just like the smell, almost one dimensional. Except this time the bitter citrus hops were more prominent. It still had the same malt backbone that was in the smell. I did notice that when it warms up a little bit, the citrus hops get even more bitter then what it originally was. It you like drinking nothing but hops, then you'll love the taste of this years Celebration Ale. For me, I like a little more flavor than just citrus hops with little caramel malts.  Mouthfeel: It was medium bodied with a strong aftertaste of bitter citrus hops with a minor taste of alcohol at the end. At one time during the aftertaste, I thought I might had tasted fruits that weren't citrus. That was a surprise to me. It's too bad that it didn't show up in the initial taste.  Drinkability: After drinking craft beer for a couple of years now and even after this beer has over 1,000 reviews, I finally got to try this beer. I thought it was fitting to try now, since it is Christmas now as I right this review. I don't think I would drink this years Celebration Ale any more, but I would like to see how this beer turns out differently every year. If you like to celebrate hops, then this is the beer to do it with.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smells of holiday spices like nutmeg and clove, along with a citrus smell and caramel. Taste is bitter, very much pale ale, with spices and pine, but with a malty finish. Very little citrusy hops though. Medium in body and smooth.

Smell is a delicious combination of citrus and piney hops. Malt comes on strong with a bready caramel malt character.  Taste is a little sharp up front. Powerful fruity hop bitterness and strong toasted malty base really gets your attention. This is big beer that stays balanced. Finish is clean and spicy with hints of nutmeg.

140,1904,Chaz,4.27,"Pours a clear orange-copper with firm visual evidence of suspended yeast. Frothy off-white head pours convex (!) into my bulb, and seems to last a good five minutes before subsiding. Lacing is about as good as it gets. Nose is grapefruit, juicy pineapple, and resiny pine with both pale and biscuity malts all but submerged in the background. First sip is piquant; spicy hops meet pungent-but-well-mannered yeast and sweet pale malt. A firm but not overshadowing hop bitterness lingers from one sip (or gulp) to the next. Fruity, with notes of honeydew and pear. The alcohol is considerable not as prominent as it might be if this were a lighter-bodied brew - it shows itself in between the sweet, light fruit notes of the malt and the firmly bitter (and slightly citric) hops. Moderately full bodied but drinks ""lighter"" than it is. Carbonation is ample . . . has a cleansing, semi-creamy mouthfeel, never a dull moment! The hops really shine here, with both aromatic and bittering qualities vying for your complete attention, and of the latter there's always been some of the same back-of-the-throat bitterness that you'll get when eating a fresh grapefruit. Slightly minty qualities to these hops, too . . .A classic brew, and about as consistent as they come.

Smell: The nose has rich caramel malts and grapefruity hops.  Taste: This is still quite bitter. Unlike the nose, there's more resinous piney hops than citrusy hops. Plenty of caramel malts and bready malts take over towards the middle. Warming alcohol, not a lot, but more than I remember and more than makes sense, come in to join the hops in the finish.

Sweet and hoppy in the front, with a bitter hop sting in the finish. There's a bit of lingering spice, too, at the end. It's tasty enough.  Great body to this beer.

The taste is again spicy from the hops with a bit of citrus flavor to round off the spice. There is a peppery bitter aftertaste as well that will stay with you for a while. The taste reminds me of something but I can't place it though. The alcohol isn't really noticable masked by the hoppiness. The mouthfeel is good with the right amount of carbonation light for a winter beer but good for an IPA. An IPA is an intersting choice for a winter beer but this one works, because of the high level of spicy hops for me the drinkability is a little low because of the intense flavor.

The hops are front and center and generally beat up on the malt (and your taste buds), and although you wouldnt call this beer perfectly balanced, its also not as extreme as something like a Hop Devil or Smuttynose IPA.

140,1904,trevorwideman,4.32,"12oz bottle of the 2006 edition courtesy of fisherman34, thanks! Poured into a pint glass.  Pours a filtered reddish-orange colour with a full inch of pillowy head. Carbonation is medium, and keeps the head very lively. Smell is wonderfully hoppy, leaning more towards an orange/grapefruit character, a bit resiny and a little floral. There's definitely a serious caramel malt backbone in there as well, but the hop monster within rules the day.  As the ale hits the tongue it goes through some stages, albeit very quickly. A quick burst of honeylike earthy sweetness that quickly gets replaced by a big grapefruit hop presence. This is just thick with oily and piney hop character. Dancing across the tongue, the light malt is completely overshadowed by a clinic in the flavour characteristics of hops. Not as flowery as some, but everything else is there in full force. Be warned, there's little in the way of a yin/yang balance in this one, it's just one hell of a hop wallop. This one dries the palate nicely, and I didn't find it to be overcarbonated, just enough to introduce you to the flavour profile. Drinkability comes down to your enjoyment of bitter beers, and for me, this could be a great session ale in the right mood. Some days I was a hop monster, some days I don't.

Front side you chew into a big whack of caramel malts then the rush of Yakama valley hops balances the taste out with large dosages of grapefruit and pine flavors....mid palate these flavors mingle and the hops prevail, taking you into the herbal-piney bittering finish...light aftertaste of grapefruit peel...damn that was good! Like an alpha oil cocktail!  Unbalanced? You bet!.... this is a NW Hop showcase...but who cares?

I've read a number of posts (not reviews) referencing this beer and expected a more complex aroma. I can't pick anything out that comes to the front.  T - Good enough. I used to drink a ton of SNPA. I t was my staple summer neighborhood outing/Canada fishing camp/camping beer for years. This certainly tastes better to me, with a stronger bitter hoppy presence, but again, nothing spectacular.  M - Full bodied, creamy, spreads broadly across the palate with a very nice bitter finish. This I like for sure.  D - Like the SNPA, I could drink these all day. Nothing to object to, but also nothing to write home about.  Maybe I've conditioned myself to ""BIG"" beers and Belgian's filled with complexity, but I can't find a real standout feature to this beer. It's certainly a pleasant enough drinker, and its' low ABV will make it sessionable for sure, but all in all, I'm not blown away by any means.  I saw a local watering hole has it on tap. I'll try that and also re-visit this one in a few weeks to give it another chance.  Cheers",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Phatz,4.08,"2006 release - bottle  Appearance: Pours a beautiful amber color with am off-white head that lasts and lasts and load of sticky lacing plastering the glass.  Smell: Bold pine hops lead the way with a hint of citrus too; big big hops in the nose. A Floral perfumey character hides behind the greens but not a big sweet.  Taste: Straight forward and tasty. This is such a terrific beer. It requires no thinking just enjoyment of the hops and bitter rind. There is a sweet malt attribute but it is certainly too small to balance the hop driven beer. It Starts and end with bitter hops and even through the middle the (cascade maybe) hops pull the cart.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is terrific, with so much bitterness driving the taste buds wild a yet a malt thickness to it, and a hint of alcohol hitting the palate it is quite nice across the palate.  Drinkability: When I was more new to hops I couldn't handle more than one of these. Now I could have a couple it is still not a session beer by any standards. It is bold and big but a worthy buy.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beerogre,4.45,"After bottle 3 out of the 6 pack (all sampled on different occasions, I hasten to add) I'm really warming up to this brew. I have steadily developed an appreciation of hop forward beers over the last few months, which is certainly of assistance when sampling beers by Sierra Nevada.  Maybe it's just me, but I find that all of the beers I've tried of theirs have an underlying ""trademark"" Sierra Nevada taste. I also detect a similar underlying taste with all Samuel Adams beers - though obviously different from the SN taste.  I found myself gulping the beer down fairly quickly at first, but it doesn't take long before the abv kicks in and applies the brakes a little.  A nice little brew this one, which initially I didn't think I was going to like very much due to an overly bitter taste, but subsequent tastings have dug out the sweetness quite nicely, and it turns out to be a lot more balanced than I first thought.  Update 2/28/09  Since my original review over 2 years ago, my palate has completely transformed and evolved towards a strong preference for extremely hoppy beers. Whereas I used to favor and seek out the sweet and malty, my brain has been taken over by the quest for hops. As one who generally hates going along with the crowd, this kind of apparent sheep like behavour would normally disturb me. However, I really don't give a toss - Just give me the god damn hops!  Therefore, as SN Celebration Ale has now become one of my favorite beers, and adequately caters to my hop fix needs I have adjusted my original scoring accordingly.  The reappearance of Celebration is definitely one of the many highlights of the beer calendar.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BattleRoadBrewer,4.13,"Served at about 38F from a 12 oz bottle in a standard pint. Aroma at the bottleneck is malty with some piney hops. Pours thick, color is medium dark amber, crystal clear, with a fluffy tan head that leaves excellent lacing. Aroma is malty, but mostly piney hops with a bit of citrus; Chinook is a very aromatic dry hop that will dominate its peers. Taste is a lot of bitterness up front. Dry flavor and thick mouthfeel. Strong hop flavor to balance with aroma, and maltiness. Delightful peppery aftertaste. Surprised there's no rye in the grain bill given the sharp flavor. Would be closer to ideal with slightly less bittering (or a few months aging, perhaps). Upon warming, it tastes even richer and more aromatic. It's a seasonal release, but not full of oddball ""Christmas"" additives. Drinkability is excellent. Goes down easy and tastes great. I wish I'd bought two, since I'd like a second right now! A fantastic American IPA, and one of my favorite beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HimerMan,3.95,"12oz bottle from 2004, poured into my Delirium Tremens glass.  Pours a very nice deep redish orange with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy off-white head and immediately has a flowery aroma.  Smells like a nice mixture of malt and hops, but somewhat subdued hops with the 2 years of aging on the beer.  Taste - Mostly a hop-taste, which is very mild and a nice wave of malt that is coming through really well right now. It almost has an ESB taste to it, and a light carmel/(almost)mocha flavor.  The mouthfeel is nothing extreme - which is excellent, this could be a great session beer and would go well with many types of food. I consider this to be very mild for an IPA, and would suggest having friends try this first before launching into a double IPA or high-octane brew.  Overall this beer is highly drinkable, and aging them really pays off well. If you want this to be really hoppy - drink them fresh, but I have a feeling the 2004 batch will improve for a while to go. I'd definitely suggest trying this one.  Cheers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mwolfe,4.63,This is truly a great beer. Pours a nice copper orange color. A bit thicker but not as dry as the sierra nevada pale ale I am used to drinking (I prefer this for sure). Nice lasting head with decent lacing afterwards. The taste has nothing out of the ordinary but it has everything you need from a great tasting Ale. Hop flavor is strong but not overpowering. Its similar to a stone Arrogant bastard with a bit less hoppiness and abv. There have been few beers i've enjoyed more than this beer. A definite winner all winter. I'll be purchasing this again for sure.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,psinderson,4.35,"Served on-tap in a pint glass at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse.  Appearance: Nice amber color, very clear. Slightly off-white head that has some staying power.  Smell: Definite citrus hops and some caramel. I also detect a hint of vanilla.  Taste: Very hoppy, yet smooth. Not too much holiday spice here, but there is a definite caramel note that differs from a typical IPA.  Mouthfeel: Nice medium bodied feel. Pleasant to drink.  Drinkability: For a hoppy brew, this is easy to consume. It also hides the ABV well...could be a dangerous thing!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BeerBelcher,4.53,"The only other Sierra Nevada product I'm really familiar with is the IPA...I must say I am very impressed with this one!  It pours a beautiful sparkling copper color with an abundant tan head. It looked great in the pint glass.  Smell is pleasant but not overpouring, and is honestly the weakest attribute of this excellent beer.  Taste is slightly sweet and hoppy. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky...it seems to stick to the roof of your mouth like an IPA. I regret I only bought one of these...I could drink several more. Not much more to say, except that I highly recommend this beer!  (2006 edition)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,msubulldog25,3.96,"The 2006 version, served on draught at Capt. Ankeny's in Portland, OR. A standard pint glass-full. My second taste of this beer (this year's version), with the previous one coming in November from a 12 oz. bottle (no review).  A: Glowing copper, shiny like a new penny. 1 finger of creamy off-white head. A clear ale with what I'd call 'sleepy' carbonation bubbles - a few loose ones here and there, floating lazily to the surface. Nice creamy film to cap it off and good lace.  S: Hmmm..underwhelming. Clean & fairly sweet hops but far from special. A little sourdough malt aroma.  T: Nice and juicy. Hops are crisp with ample pine and citrus flavors. A tangy finish with hints at some spiciness, which I'm not sure whether to a attribute to hops or a true spice additive in the mix.  M: Slick, slightly buttery. The hops bathe the tastebuds and permeate the mouth. Satisfying fullness of body with a good mouthfeel. Finish is slightlly bitter and has some alcohol warming.  D: Smooth, drinkable beer. A nice IPA, regardless of season...I almost wish SN would brew this year-round. Then again, some of the specialness would be lost as this IS their 'winter seasonal'. Recommended for your enjoyment.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dfried,4,"Celebration '06  Orangish amber in color, frothy 2cm tan head. The aroma is of sweet pale and caramel malts, with a fair amount of hops which are a good blend of citrus, floral, and resinous characters. There was a lot of citrus in the taste right away, oranges and tangerines, some peach like flavor, but the floral and musty/resinous notes were still definitely there too. Quite malty, a tad more than just a backbone, but still plenty of room the for the hops to be showcased. Mouthfeel is dry and a little sticky.  Verdict: Celebration is a new beast every year, but they are all consistantly good, this year was no different. Pretty good, easy to drink, worth picking up a couple times over the season, but when its gone, I am not counting down the days until its released next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,chadspivey,4.5,"2006 batch, poured into a pint glass..  A: Clear amber color with a nice two finger white head that takes a full 2 minutes to dissipate to a small litte mini head, which lasts the whole beer, leaving nice lacing.  S: smells like the most lovely hops ever. not like BAM, in your face hops, more like ooo yea thats nice hops.  T: this is one of my favorite American IPA's ever. just a beautiful blend of hops and malt. vanilla i present, small hints of oranges. Pine is definitely a part of this beer. aftertaste is really nice! the key here is balance....and balance there is, just the right amount of hops to make me beg for more.  M: kinda shocks the mouth, which normally would make me ready for a mouth fulla hops to the max, but the malt balances it out and makes it smoooth. Body is almost perfect, if it were cask conditioned, THAT would be perfect.  D: I've drank like 7 of these one night out of a keg at a party. Found myself hanging out around the keg most of the night. There's no stopping this beer... until they're gone.  I don't feel like i'm im being generous giving it straight 4.5's.

Excellent retention - it lasted all throughout the tasting. Smell is overall sweet and warm: toasted grain, spices like clove and cinnamon, oranges. Taste is complex: begins with a light brush of hops on the tongue. They open fully on the back of the tongue. Strong pine, some acidic citrus quality, too. Not much of the barley or spices. The hops seem to get stronger as the beer warms to room temperature. Good aftertaste - the hops continue to morph. Mouthfeel is right up the middle: not too watery, not too creamy. Overall, a strong offering in both the Christmas ale and IPA categories. Would gladly pick up one of these again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

After breaking my only snifter last night whilst washing it, it looks as though I'll be drinking pint only for a little while. Luckily Celebration calls for a pint glass, so no harm done.  Pours a clearish amber color with a fine, foamy two finger head. Head fades shortly after the pour to a small cap. Lacing persists throughout.  Smell is sweet and hoppy. A little piney, a little fruity.  The taste on this one is a nice balance of malt and hops. Its sweet, slightly caramel-like with a crisp hop finish. Very well balanced.  Mouthfeel is crisp and slightly drying, with the alcohol well hidden, though there's a slight warming.  A very tasty, very drinkable IPA from Sierra Nevada.

140,1904,Tesno,4.17,"Very attractive orange-amber color, pours a thick, white, frothy head that dissipates kind of quickly but a thin white lace persists. Aroma reminiscant of grapefruit and pinetree with a hint of orange peel. Though the three ""C""s (Cascade, Chinook and Centennial) dominate there is a slightly sweet malt and alcohol note to the nose. Flavor is hop-dominated with a good amount of malt backbone. Quite delicious. More malt and alcohol notes as the beer warms. Decent body with a slight stickiness perhaps from the high amount of hop resins? Overall, a very enjoyable American-style IPA, too bad it's only available during the holiday season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,doubleshovels,3.96,"This is one of those GREAT with food brews. Pours clean and tastes crisp, with a stand-up creamy white head.

140,1904,BadBadger,3.7,"Sierra Nevada's Clebration Ale pours a nice amber color. The nice and thick foamy head is descent sized and lasts for awhile. The smell is floral, hoppy.

Taste is strange, almost medicinal, toffee, pine, citrus, heavy spices, bitterness is out of whack, not sure whether I like this.

140,1904,dbalsock,3.33,"Appearance: Light to medium amber with substantial head, off white in color. It looked pretty especially the foamy top.  Smell: Grapefruit, perfume, pine and a light malt background make up the aroma.  Tastte: Very intense grapefruit leads to an aftertaste of grapenuts. It's not as floral as I expected, but retains the piney notes from the aroma. It's not nearly as balanced as I like and doesn't stand out from the other CA IPAs.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly bitter in an unsatisfying way, but it does cover up the alcohol.

A - Clear yet bubbly copper color with a solid 3/4 inch off-white head. Lacing is clean and moderate in its coating effect.  S - Clean hop scent that melds nicely with the sweet barley. Bitter hop scent takes the lead here, but it doesn't contain that overpowering floral scent of more aggressive IPAs. Smell is rather faint and I am not detecting much in the way of spice or fruit.  T - Begins with a pleasant almost biscuity sweetness that merges into a nice, slightly bitter hop aftertaste. Again, spice seems low, creating a very enjoyable and clean beer that isolates its main ingredients.  M - Bitterness is mild and this brew defines the term clean throughout the palate. Carbonation is mild as well. Overall, the beer is thick, smooth and filling on the tongue.  D - Due to its cleaner balance between hop and malt, the Celebration is a nice change of pace in the IPA canon.

They are resiny with grapefruit and citrus as the primary flavors and they are very bold. The hops are supported by a spectrum of holiday spices, including nutmeg, cinnamon, and orange peel. None of the flavors are so intense that they overwhelm the hops. Finally the malts are biscuity, providing a nice base for all of the activity.

I do not have much to add to what has already been said about the 2006/2007 offering because most of what was said in the last few weeks (in reviews below) accurately describes the A-S-T-M & D. I wanted to add that this year's is better than last years because the hops did not hit me as overly ""bitter"".  I am not sure what makes this a holiday ale besides the timing of its release as it does not contain the spices found in the likes of a christmas /plum pudding.  I feel this should be offered year round because it is hands down my favorite IPA period! It is an exaple of perfection in a glass/keg and more brewers should aim for such high standards. It is hoppy yet never astringent like what you get in EVERY damn DIPA. The alcohol is very well hidden (so beware). It goes down so easy it is sickening.  I do not review many beers. I do not heap praise on many things but this beer is so balanced and really puts the ""Craft"" in Craft brews.

S - Piney and grapefruit citrus hints. Expected from an IPA, but the freshness is exquisite. Nice biscuit malt smell as well.  T - Grapefruit citrus hints are exceptional, with the biscuit malt finishing off with a nice bready taste. The piney hints are there at the beginning hidden behind a nice and light alcoholic ester.

Mouthful is very smooth and mellow. Perfectly carbonated.  Extremely drinkable. If you enjoy beer with strong bitter hops, you'll enjoy this beer.

I have seen this beer around the block for many years, but always was under the impression that it was a spiced up holiday ale a la the Belgian ""Noel's"", which I don't care much for. So I always passed it by. But I was feeling spontaneous the other day, and picked up a sixer. Only to discover that this is one chock-hop-filled IPA, reminiscent (but bolder than) the Sierra Nevada IPA, which I first found this past summer. OK, enough of my back story.  Typical orange/golden of an IPA, with almost no head- a vigorous pour did very little. This runs against other reviews I've seen, so who knows?  Medium-bodied aroma dominated by sharp astringent hops. Flavor is all about the hops- sharp, oily,harsh on the back of the throat hops. A good IPA, similar to the regular IPA but with an ""enhanced"" hop presence. Good, but I prefer the fruitier hops.  A decent offering from Sierra Nevada, obviously popular, so maybe I'm missing something.

The 2008 version of celebration is by far my favorite. Gone is the pineyness of the previous versions. In its place are the floral/tropical fruit notes I love.

Overall, IMO Celebration is not living up to the hype, however it is still a good brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tcfishler,3.71,"Pours a clear light reddish amber with a thick and frothy offwhite head.  Easygoing malt and hops on the balanced nose.  Mouthfeel is soft with relatively low carbonation. Flavors begin subtly sweet but then veer towards citrus-y hops, but still with a slightly sweet edge. There's a bit of smokiness lurking in the background as well. Finish is medium in length and not too bitter relative to other IPA's I've had.  Enjoyable and drinkable winter brew that's a good alternative to the heavier wintertime sippers...also a good value.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Cresant,4.07,"Poured this 12 oz. brown bottle dated 2006 into an IPA glass. The body was clear and golden. One finger of head quickly turned to white wisps of lace.  Smell was citrus hops. Fresh and pungent. Piney with hints of b.o. Nice.  Taste was pleasantly parching bitterness. Easily quaffable. I enjoyed the 2006 more than the 2005, I'm guessing the freshness improved the taste for me.  Mouthfeel was zesty and slightly oily. A very solid IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dfourh,3.6,"I've got a 2005 (kept in the fridge all year) open next to a 2006 and the difference is pretty substantial. I loved the 2005, and it is still beautiful. It starts out clean and bright with a silky mouthfeel and then comes a wave of light sweetness & autumn leafy hop complexity, and then comes the hard concentrated hop finish that lasts and lasts. The 2006 has a burst of pleasant hops at the start leading into a long lingering hop finish, but it is far thinner on the palate--there is a whole mid-range fullness/richness missing, and the overall hop impact, despite the nice long finish, doesn't have the same lush glory without the core complexity to play off of. The 2006 doesn't seem anything more than some typically pleasant IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,FenwaySquid,4.83,"Presentation: 12 oz short brown bottle, no bottling date but the year ""2006"" was part of the label design so we'll leave it at that, poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful clear copper color. The head formed a perfect 2 fingers and faded very slowly into a thin layer that never dissipated any further.  Aroma: Very hoppy.  Taste: Like the aroma, very hoppy. There's some sweet maltiness in the background, but it's barely noticeable. Besides that this one is all hops through and through, from beginning to end. The finish is very hoppy and bitter, leaving one with the desire for more.  Mouthfeel: Despite the strong tastes and relatively high ABV, it's very smooth. The carbonation is well balanced as well.  Overall: As IPA's go, it's tough to imagine it can get any better than this. I used to wonder why it was that everyone would rush out and buy case upon case of this stuff when it was released. Now I understand.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jeffjfindley,3.93,"I had to dock this one a bit, because honestly it isn't much of a departure from their flagship Pale Ale. It is a lot prettier, great amber color & great head retention. The smell is that of a typical west coast pale with a little more spice.  The taste is good, but not entirely remarkable. I get a trace of holiday spice at the tail end. The hop profile is virtually identical to their pale, but the malt texture is a hair toasier.  Mouthfeel is good, with a puckery finish. Very drinkable. If you like their pale, it stands to reason you'll like this. Nothing to get too worked up over though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,KevPet84,4.49,"This is a brew I look forward to see on-tap or bottle every year. The look is nothing out of the ordinary for an IPA except the color is darker than most. The smell reminds me of going christmas tree hunting after Thanksgiving. Pine, holiday spices, and the hops are in the sent. I am also wondering if there is a little tea-tree oil in there. Great beer for holiday meals, maybe not a honey ham but it could do it. Laces hold up but the head does disapper quickly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,goochpunch,4.82,"Pours a garnet amber color with mild carbonation, a frothed off-white head, and distinct lacing patterns. Smells of a balanced mixture of toasted malt, caramel, toffee, bright citrus, pine resin, and slight butter notes. Oily hops hit first on the tongue and remain as an underlying flavor throughout the tasting, on to the aftertaste. In the middle there comes the sweet malt body, full of toasty, candy-like tones. Finishes bitter and slightly dry. Mouthfeel is certainly more than middle of the road and it has a slight, prickly carbonation which amplifies the hops on the tongue. Highly drinkable, although the alcohol is pretty big on this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bjohnson,4.47,"On tap at Bukowski's Boston.  A: Pours a very nice almost clear amber color with a frothy one and a half finger white head. Nice retention and excellent lacing left. S: Good dose of citrus hops, mostly grapefruit, but there are also some piney notes thrown in too. A bit of grassyness also. T/M: Love the taste of this beer. Solid. Big fruity citrus hop presence impacts the taste buds immediately with an explosion. Good backbone of sweet malt, with some caramel and nutty notes being the most noticeable. Smooth across the palate with a good level of spicy bitterness. Bitter finish with a slightly citric aftertaste. Great on tap! D: One of the best offerings during this great season. Solid IPA. Highly drinkable--could almost be a session beer if the abv was slightly lower.

Piney hops, caramel, bready yeast, and a light citrus scent make up the aroma for this years version.  The flavor is hoppy, with pine resin and grapefruit being the main players. Sweeter caramel undertones also come through more as it warms. Some have said that the 2006 release is a disappointment...but not me.  Thinner medium body with active carbonation. Hop oils give it a slick feel on the tongue. Dry, slightly bitter aftertaste. This is one tasty brew. It didn't take long for me to work through a six pack, which could be a bad thing ;-) .

140,1904,eberkman,4.18,"Pours an attractive golden copper into a pint glass. A big, billowy 1-inch tan head forms (and sticks around for a good long while, ultimately diminishing to about 1/4 inch by the end). Leaves some pleasing lacing on the glass.  The beer presents an aroma of piney hops. The taste is also dominated by hops with piney and some citric notes. Some malty sweetness on the intake, which becomes much more apparent when you hold it in your mouth a bit. The sweet notes also burst through as the beer warms in the glass. Contains a bitter, hoppy but not overpowering finish.  Very drinkable -- this went down pretty quickly and smoothly. I wanted another one, but unfortunately bought singles during my last trip to TJ's.  A very nice IPA -- one I could imagine drinking all year around.

Very nice clarity.  The nose is very hoppy but adds a sweet malt presence for balance. The hop aroma is very fresh with alot of pine aromas befitting the season. A faint, sugary, sweet malt smell balances the hops slightly. Very balanced in presentation and not overpowering.  Hops hit the palate like a freight train from the very beginning. The hop flavor has a lot of grassy, deep citrus tastes. Allowing this to warm slightly provides for a few sweet flavors at the midpoint of a sip. The finish is strong and hop-laden with bitter, pine flavors. A little more balance would be nice.  Mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated, quite viscous for the style but a little on the oily side.  Drinkability is very good. Naturally, hop presence is very pronounced but it is certainly welcome.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A dry nutmeg finish. For being a x-mas beer I'm glad the holiday spices are well intergrated. I wish I could find this on draft some where to see if the head would be more impressive.

Anyhoo, this pours beautifully copper-red hued into my pint glass, with a raging head and ample lacing. Nose is strippped down, piney hops against an undertone of sweet malt and caramel. Nicely blended and well done.  Extra round flavors of bitter but not overwhelming hoppiness and enough balance to keep me interested. Aftertaste is mellow and moderately oily and resonannt in the mouth. Texture is fluid in the mouth, unmarred by alcohol or carbonation. I could easily down a few of these.

OVerall a good IPA and very drinkable.  2005: After having aged for a year the 2005 is slightly darker both in body and head color. The head holds and laces better as well. In the smell, the hop flavor is much more subdued but the malt aroma seems much more complex. The taste reveals the complexity with a subdued hop flavor but very fruity and diverse malt profile. There is sitll a good amount of bitterness. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied and stickier than the 2006 version. Overall this is a very complex and much better beer than the 2006.

It has a slight caramel malt flavor balancing it out well.  This beer goes down smooth, leaving a grassy hop aftertaste. It is carbonated perfectly.  I think this beer would be a good session beer. It is not too aggresively flavored, and it is not too high in alcohol.  Overall: The first time I had this beer, was about 5 years ago, before I liked anything other than Fat Tire. I got a pint of it at a punk show because it was on sale for $2. I hated it. I dont think I had it all. I thought it tasted like a flower. I cant believe how wrong I was.

The taste is a pleasing blend of sweet malt, orange, red grapefruit and pineapple up front. This is a sweet, tropical delight of an IPA. The sweetness is well balanced by a huge hop character with bitter, piney hops. The alcohol is well masked, with the exception of a subtle spiciness. This is a smooth and extremely well balanced IPA.  Mouthfeel includes a light/medium body, with excellent carbonation and very little viscosity.

140,1904,jokelahoma,4.3,"Bright, new-penny copper, not unlike the company's pale ale. Decent sized head that didn't last terribly long.  Smell seems quite sweet, with the earthy maltiness that begs one to drink it. There is some hop presence here, but it doesn't seem aggressive. Mostly the bready, crackery, and caramelly malt dominates the nose, at least to me.  The taste, on the other hand, is very much hop dominated. The sweetness detected in the nose hardly makes an appearance in the taste at all. There's a good, sharp bitterness right up front, followed almost immediately by the wonderful citrus and vegetable taste of the hops. Any sweetness is only detected as holding the bitterness in check. The hop flavor finally starts to fade at the end of the sip, allowing the same initial bitterness to once again take center stage, and slowly exit, stage left, with the aftertaste. It seems to linger on the tongue, in a sort of muted ""pop rocks"" type tingle. It's drying, as well, making you reach for the glass again long before the taste dies down in your mouth. Quite nice.  The mouthfeel is probably thicker than one may perceive, due to what seems to be higher than normal carbonation levels, and the dryness of the hops. Appropriate for the style, though.  Overall, this is very well done. It can be a bit of a shocker if you spend a great deal of time with the aroma, as to me, the aroma and the taste were almost polar opposites. They compliment one another quite nicely, however.

More like clumps of lacing. Good lookin' overall.  Nose: Big time fruity/leafy smelling hop hits the nose first , then some sweet malted barley scent floats in too. Sweet caramel malt, spice and pine cone round it out. *Earthy and grainy hops, dried leaves and a robust, toasted barley and light maple syrup.  Taste: A sweet and tart fruity hop flavor turns to leafy, bitter and dry hop very fast, this is a very nice bitter hop though with some fruitiness and wheat/grains, malted flavors mixed in. This is a very cascade-style hop oriented beer... Big time pine and grapefruit. The malt really takes a back seat to the big flavorful hop tastes. My girlfriend (she works in a brewery and knows her beers well)* Now Wife! Stated: ""Wow, wicked hoppy!"" I can't disagree. The alcohol is noticable on the way down.

140,1904,rayjay,4.6,"I'd like to dedicate this review to all the Celebration Ale bashers out there.  And, when it came time for my 100th review, I could think of no better beer! Released about 3 weeks ago. Served on tap from Tres Hombres, a Mexican restaurant in downtown Chico, CA. Keg was tapped yesterday.  What a great looking beer. Copper colored, and the head is off-white with a slight carmel color. The head persists for the whole beer and cakes the sides of the pint glass. One confident brew.  Nose is full of C-hops, which can also come across as Deep Woods Off bug spray.  This beer is the definitive C-hop beer. The first assault on your tongue comes in the form of fruitcake, with lots of dried fruits, pine, spicy carbonation, and hearty fresh-baked bread. About one second later, all is taken over by a dominant bitter wave, which persists through the relatively long fallout.  This one has a strong ale body, and is both balanced and taken over by the hops; balanced because it's heavy, but never sweet, and it gladly hands the spotlight over to the bitterness.  Maybe there's a novelty to drinking it in it's home town, a day after it's been tapped and 3 weeks after it's release and the chilly weather outside, but boy oh boy, this is one fine beer and I'm really enjoying it right now, and it's the absolute perfect pairing for these spicy fajitas in front of me. Perfect fall weather beer.  This would also pair perfect with fruity ice cream, like peach or mango.  Well, here's to another 100 reviews, and then some!

T: Strong vegetal hops flavor balanced well with a dry maltiness. The hop bitterness creeps through and finishes with a kick.  M: Meidum bodied with moderate carbonation. Lingering flavor.

140,1904,Franchise,4.15,"This beer pours a orange amber with a thick white lace that sticks to the glass with this offering. The smell is citrus piney hops, with a honey lemon candy sweetness. The taste starts with a citrus rind bitterness that leaves a smack on the tongue followed by a balancing sweetness of caramel, and faint presence of alcohal but in by no means overwhelming. This is a quality brew that is a hop lovers delight and gives you just enough balance to keep your palate coming back for more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,boulevard2,3.98,Celebration 2006 12 oz bottle with a cool house and winter scene going on in the background.  Pours a rich amber ale with a thick head that stands firm and ready to be taken. Scent of roasted malts and hopps are present. A floral essence along with a fruity citric bite.

140,1904,geexploitation,4.43,"2006 edition. Pours a very clear, brilliant dark amber with a yellow cream head that almost glows in the dark. Gorgeous. Grapefruity hop aromas mix with a slight carapils note in the aroma. On the tongue, initial citrus sourness mixes with distinct, saliva-producing bitterness -- just the right amount, not too little, not too much, not too harsh. Carbonation is substantial but not overdone as it helps all the flavors of this beer come out. Malt sweetness provides a solid base. The finish is long and smacks of whole-grain bread. Everything here is so well balanced. It's got depth and sessionability. A stellar example of an American IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,clabaugh,3.57,"Appearance: Clear pale amber with a bubbly, cream-colored head. Retains lustily, with faint lacing.  Smell: Pungent, piney hops complimented with some hearth-roasted malts. Floral and vinous, accented with spice.  Taste: Intensely bitter as piney hops inundate the taste buds. Beyond the hops, there is a bountiful roasted maltiness. Some burnt chestnut emerges through a bitterness that is really persistent.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with some palate-deadening properties. Soothing and smooth on the tongue, and warming on the way down.  Drinkability: Richly flavored, but perhaps overly bitter. Deceptively inebriating, but ideal for providing sustenance for the long winter months. Above average brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,jslot38,4.03,"I remember this one from last year, I enjoyed it and am looking forward to this year's version.  Appearance: Poured from a 12 oz stubby into an american pint glass. A lovely copper colour with a fluffy pillow of head. Head is slightly off white and you can begin to see some lacing forming immediatly. Head slowly diminishes to a finger.  Smell: Hop overload. Citrus hops, earthly foundations... what more is there to say.  Taste: Not as much hops as I expected but still a good amount. Hits you right up front. Earth ridden hops mostly, pine and such... some citrus. Rounds out nicely with some biscuit malts.  Mouthfeel: Sits nicely, not harsh at all as you may expect with something of such a hop profile.  Drinkability: Could certainly drink a few of these, not a six pack by any means. But in terms of a seasonal IPA, this is drinkable.  Notes: One of those beers that makes winter seasonals such a great event.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Not what I would call balanced, but certainly a lot of flavor in this one. M: Perfect carbonation, and the hops are slick. D: I'm drinking my second one right now, and I don't think I could drink any more tonight...too hoppy. But certainly a great beer to have one or two of before changing to something else.

140,1904,sloejams,4.57,"2006 edition  Sure, Halloween just ended yesterday. Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale, one of the most eagerly waited annual beers, was in stores last week. And no surprise here, it's delicious.  It pours an orange-copper with a slight head. Robust hops - pine and floral are balanced by a roasted malt aroma. There's a slight sweetnesss - caramel / cinnamon. The taste has citrus (lemon / orange) notes, but mostly - it's very balanced. Perhaps, because it was only bottled quite recently - it tastes extremely fresh. This is what fall tastes like. It's very crisp, thorough palate coverage, with bitter finish.  Easy drinking, time to stock up. Last year's got better with over the past year. I have a feeling this one is best right now.

140,1904,rarevos,3.68,"Poured into pint glass. I've never had this beer before, and wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  A: Pours a coppery-amber with lots of fluffy, very light tan head. Head has great retention, and leaves sticky trails behind in abundance as it recedes. It's not in a hurry to recede, though.  S: Malty sweet grapefruit aroma up front, with some toffee behind that. Somewhat sugary.  T: Some nice citrus (grapefruit, lemon zest) with a good malty presence. Caramel, candi sugar. There's a bit of pine and some lemongrass. Finish is nicely bitter and fruity with a long, bitter tail.  M: Medium-bodied.  D: This doesn't drink like a 6.8% abv beer, that's for sure. But it perhaps suffered from too much hype. It was a good beer, but it didn't change my life. I will say that the one really nice thing about this beer is that it's not reminiscent of winter at all, but it IS warming. It's fruity, flowery, piney, and bright, so it's reminding me of some warmer/nicer days from a few months ago.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bgraney,4.23,"Pours golden/honey color, dramtic carbonation, full fluffy white head, one to gaze upon. Citrus aroma over a malty background. The hops are most notable at first taste with the malt flavor lingering, followed by a lemony finish, excellent. Smooth mouthfeel filling the mouth with citrusy hop goodness. I was expecting more of a cinnamon/nutmeg type flavor considering the season and the label but it seems like more of a summer beer to me.

Aroma is well balanced between malt and hops. Slightly sweet, and a bit of citrus aroma from the hops, this is an enjoyable nose.  Flavor is mild, yet full. Malty, caramel sweetness up front, followed by a nice punch of hop flavors and bitterness. Again, slightly citric hop character, seeming using all the usual suspects of the ""C"" hops in a typical American IPA. No alcohol present. Mouthfeel is full, and slick. Drinkability is excellent.  One of the better beers from Sierra Nevada IMO. Not nearly as interesting as Bigfoot, but still one that I look forward to each year.

S - orange, citrus, lots of flowery notes. Some spice - cinnamon, allspice, although I'm pretty sure this is not a spice beer. Light, sweet bready malt. Beautiful smell.  T - well balanced, extra-large IPA flavors. Tart, dry citrus, pine, mixed with a strong, slightly sweet malt backbone of caramel, toffee, bread.  M - creamy, mixture of dry hop tartness and creamy malt.  D - one of the great seasonal brews of all-time. Wish they made it year round. Tasty, well balanced IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I wish it was available all year round.  Appearance: Copper colored with about a half inch head.  Aroma: Citrusy hops, lots of hops.  Taste: Bitter/hoppy, citrus, a little malt.  I highly recommend it and will definetely be buying more before the end of the season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Grundle20,3.26,"2006 October Release  Appearance: Pours copper in color in to a pint glass. There is a beefy 2 finger head with decent retention and lacing.  Smell: There's a nice hoppy aroma but there is also substantial underlying chemical notes, almost like dish detergent. If it wasn't for the hops this beer would smell disgusting.  Taste and Mouthfeel: It's pretty bitter and dry with the chemical notes carrying over from the scent. For an American IPA I'm thinking this is seriously lacking in the fruit/floral department. The chemical bitterness is also leaving me with a less than desireable after taste. I don't remember this being this dissapointing last year, not even close.  Drinkability: It's drinkable enough but there are far better offerings in the American IPA category. I really hate beers with bad aftertastes especially when it comes to drinkability.  Bottom Line: Give it a shot because it only comes out once a year, but it's just not very good this year in my opinion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It's a pretty sharp bitterness, but not overbearing. Beer is balanced quite nicely with the malts, sweet caramel. Finishes sweet, but hoppy. Quite nice.  Mouthfeel. Body is full and has a good amount of carbonation to accompany. A bit chewey.  Overall a great ipa. Not one i could sit with a six pack, because it just seems to rich in flavor.

140,1904,johnbonham1980,2.66,"*2006 edition*  I'd heard all kinds of good stuff about this beer, but was frankly disappointed with it. I suppose it's just that I've found my taste in extremely hoppy beers has waned and I've started to enjoy the more malty end of the taste spectrum, but still, I've had much better beers within this style in my time.  Poured with a 1/2 finger head into a wide mouth pint glass. Decent lacing, decent head retention considering the amount initially.  I really liked the color of this beer, a pleasant, festive orange-reddish with crystal clarity. Carbonation was lively.  Aroma is all piney, perfumey hops with some citrus. Underdeveloped sweet bread dough malt background... as it warmed, a nice grapefruit character came out which did improve the overall taste.  Mouthfeel was impressive. I really enjoyed this aspect of the beer, as it was a nice creamy, smooth mouthful.  Overall I felt this beer was a bit imbalanced and way too hop-focused. For what they're going for I think Sierra Nevada did a good job but it's just not for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,loving44,4.1,"- 2006 Celebration -   A: Pours clear, dark amber with a creamy smooth foam head that settles rather quickly to a fem CM. Thick clumps or carbonation rise from the bottom of my pint glass.  S: Hops up front: pine, citrus (grapefruit?), followed by sweet doughy malt... some ghram cracker. Slightly herbal.  T: Herbal, piney hops first trailed quickly by rich caramel malt and finishing dry and very well balanced. Leaves hop and alcohol pin pricks on the tongue. A solid well-balanced profile from beginning to end.  M: slightly syrupy at times, still remains light and refreshing. full to medium bodied and very drinkable.

140,1904,demcorhip,4.18,"Ending my night of drinking and reviewing in a fitting way, time for a Celebration!  Appearance Interesting clear reddish amber hued ale. Nice two finger off white head formed on the pour and wants to stick around. Finely and well carbonated. Somewhat thickly laced.  Aroma Clean grapefruit hop aroma on top of toasty biscuity malts with a hint of caramel.  Taste Very nice. For some reason i was expecting more hops (perhaps the hoppy pale ale or the barleywine?) but was pleasantly surprised by their take with this ale. Yes it is hoppy, but this is a wonderfully balanced IPA and not a shock and awe hop bomb. The hops hit you with grapefruit and a touch of pine, and almost but not quite reach a resinous level. This is a fairly dry IPA, malts impart mostly flavours of biscuit and some toast, with only the slightest touch of sweet caramel. The hops predominate again in the finish, perhaps with more of a pine quality than is present in the opening.  Mouthfeel This is a dry, medium bodied ale. The dry nature is probably what allows the hops to dominate even without getting too resinous. Nicely balanced IPA, and the dryness allows the hops to take centre stage. If it was sweeter (like other examples in this style) I would want more hops, but this is almost perfectly balanced.  Drinkability Having a beer like this around would make any dysfunctional family gathering worth celebrating (mental note to self: must get more for upcoming christmas season!). Would make great session fare, and is also a great example of the american IPA, and would serve as a great intro to the style for someone ready to see just what hops are all about. Ill be drinking (and reviewing) this one again. Already have a vertical tasting in mind, with my lonely single 12 oz bottles from 2004 and 2005.

Moderate lacing left behind.  Aroma is of sweet malts, citrus hoppiness, and candied fruits.  Taste is of sweet malts and very citrusy hoppiness, grapefruit, floral, hop spiciness, grassy, and ends dry/astringent. The dry hoppiness latches onto the tongue for a good time without letting the grip go.  Mouthfeel is of medium consistency and well carbonated.  Pretty drinkable for such a pungent brew. I could easily enjoy a good amount of these in a single session. Then again, I'm a hophead.  Pretty balanced beer from Sierra Nevada.

140,1904,Phocion,4.23,"Fresh 2006 release (10/28/06). Rich reddish-amber with a thick creamy white head. Excellent retention and beautiful lacing on the glass.  The first aroma I noticed through the still-strong head was, surprisingly, the sweet breaded/toffee malts. A second whiff revealed the rich bouquet of hops, citrus and floral. Excellent balance, at least in the nose.  The first swallow is where the hops take charge. Excellent floral taste with a citrus background, but not overpowering enough to where it takes away from the malts. Sweet and bready toasted malts combine to make this an excellently balanced and tasty IPA.  Thick and creamy full-bodied and well-carbonated mouthfeel with just enough alcohol to give it that warming feeling you'd expect in a winter/Christmas ale. Very smooth and addictive, though a bit of a dry finish.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Theres sort of a mellow malty break mid sip, before the fairly assertive woodly bitterness takes hold. Theres also a kind of sublte spicy quality that seems to wash over the palate as well.

140,1904,devildog1633310,4.3,A hint of pine carmal hoppiness rushes over your scenes at the first whiff over the bottle. The pour is light with very little head. The calm brown color makes up for the lack of head. It has a classic winter brew taste with a heavier alcohol content which hits the pallet quickly. I found after the second or third sip the carbination was a bit high.  In closing I honestly believe that 06' has something missing from the 04' & 05' brews. I must be honest and say I don't know what's missing.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Nice lacing from the ring that stayed on glass until I was done.  S-biscuity malt and green hops, not extreme complex but good and strong.  T-Bitter green hop hits right up front, particularly when cold. There is a nice firm malt backbone that balances out the heavy handed hops really well. Strong bitter green lingering finish that was actually quite nice. As this beer warmed up the initial hop smack subsided just enough to further release the malt. This is a good beer.

Aroma of caramel malt dominated by piney and somewhat grassy hops.  Light caramel malt flavor beneath a generous dose of piney hops - although it never completely overpowers the malt. A nice bitter bite hits about midway, but eases back as it finishes a bit dry with a slight lingering hop flavor. Seems a tad more balanced than last year's version.  Medium body, ample carbonation.  Another cheerful year of Celebration Ale.

Flavor provile very clean, with malt notes muted and hops accentuated. Flavor perfectly in line with the style.  Mouthfeel is moderate and pleasant. Malt backbone evident here, and moderately heavy carbonation also helps to accentuate the hoppiness.  If you like hops, this beer is extremely drinkable.

140,1904,jamie2dope,3.89,"So i was a little bored today, so I decided to venture to the small liquor store down the street from me in Sunderland that I had never been to before. I walked in not expecting much, but to my sheer delight, there was a sierra nevada 2005 celebration ale sixer from last year sitting in the cooler. Needless to say I was siked. Anyway, pours a really nice looking dark orange/bordering on red coloration, with a relatively thick white heading that lasted right up until the end. Smell was my only gripe with this beer. Seemed to smell like wet dogs hair, although it did get better as it warmed up a little bit...oxidation? Im not sure. Taste on the other hand was really super...the hops in this beer really attack your taste buds to the point where you can taste them well after finishing a glass. Mouthfeel was pretty heavy, but not overpowering. This is an awesome sipping beer...it really warms you up. The alcohol is also really well hidden, so ide recommend being careful with this one. This is a really awesome beer, complex yet simple at the same time...my favorite offering from the sierra nevada guys. This paired well with some sharp blue stilton cheese, though i can see it going well with just about anything. Cheers",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dblinkhorn,4.6,"2004 Vintage. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance - Pours with a two finger white, rocky head. It retains well and eventually settles at a thin layer of lace atop the brew. The beer's color is a nice honey/orange amber, and it is very clear (until I poured the sediment bottom in). The bottom inch or so of the beer in the bottle was very sediment-rich.  Smell - Fruitiness immediately on the nose: cherry, fig, plum. It smells like an old ale (not entirely suprising considing it's been aged 2 years). Very slight bitterness is also present on the nose from the hops. Malts are difficult to pick up from the smell, but it's there. A slight warming alcohol aroma is present.  Taste - Crisp bitterness from the hops paired again with some cherry, fig, and plum fruitiness. A rich bready malt character is in the background. The finish comes through with a medium sugary/buttery sweetness and eventually a sharp and dry hops bitterness. This hops bitterness follows through into the aftertaste, along with a fairly strong earthiness. A warming alcohol sense is felt through the entire taste. I wonder what the ABV is now after 2 years of aging.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied and quite smooth. The carbonation seems definitely to have decreased with age, but it is still of an average level.  Drinkability - Very good. Not quite as refreshing as a brand-new Celebration Ale, but still good.  With two years of age, this beer definitely takes on an old ale style. The medium-dark fruit flavors really come out, and the hops bitterness tones down a bit. This is my first aged-beyond-a-year taste of Celebration ale, but from what I've heard and read here on BA, two years is about the perfect time to age this particular brew. I have to say that it has definitely gotten better with age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T&M- Not full bodied but a big medium. Carbonation is perfect which creates a creamy smooth drinkability. Malt is ignored as hops burst onto the palate right away. Bitter and oily. Malt creaps into the picture just barely and is almost nutty, bread-like and somewhat caramelly. This becomes more pronounced as it warms. Hops are the star of this show with a strong but not over the top performance. Herbal and citrus qualities as well as some flowery moments. Alcohol is barely detectable. Bitternes only builds slightly so you can have more than one, just watch out because that alcohol will sneak up quick.  D- A near perfect IPA.

140,1904,rodrot,3.97,"2003 bottling. Poured a hazy reddish orange color with a 1 finger head that took a while to go down. Aroma was flowery and hoppy at first sniff, with sweet malt aroma making itself known after a few minutes. Taste: hops are definitely there, but are not nearly as prominent as a fresh example. Malty sweetness has taken over and the piney, grapefruity character of the hops has diminished. The beer had a medium bodied mouthfeel. Drinkability was fairly high and no alcohol was evident. This beer can age with the best of them, but I prefer my Celebration Ale fresh with a powerful hop presence.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,rabsten,4.4,"Leo's Carry Out in South Point, OH was dumping thier supply of this fine, fine brew at clearance prices. I suppose the fact that ""2005"" was on the bottle in large type scared them or something, because in the sam case is some Left Hand product with August 2004 brewed dates. Well, thier loss was my gain. And what a gain. I'd had '05 Celebration on tap in Charlotte but didn't review it because I lost my notes and wanted to be honest. Well, the bottles hold up real, real well.  poured into a pint glass, red-amber with red tinted head, ungodly lacing.  Smells piney, resinous, with floral notes as well. The malt is hidden below all the lovely hops. Mmm.  Taste, well, It's like SN's wonderful Pale Ale but beefed up. Hops, Hops, and Malt/Hops. Slight alcohol burn to it all.  Shockingly good mouthfeel, considering the highly hopped character and solid ABV. Smooth and silky.  Drinkability takes a minor ding because the alcohol (which really isn't that high, when you look at it) takes immediate effect. I was buzzing more after one of these than after a whole 22oz Ruination. Odd.  If SN makes a bad beer, I don't know what it could be. This is a damn good beer. I also admire that it bucks the trend of ""spicing the hell out of the annual holiday brew."" It's just a fine AIPA.  I could drink this year round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

D: Attractive for a beer lover... alcohol could be trouble.  2011 vintage, consumed Jan 2012.

M: Just reaching syrupy. Light and bubbly with good carbonation that barely becomes syrupy. Clean and refreshing. Not heavy at all.  D: Refreshing and delicious. Easy to drink/session.

Aroma:  Piney resin with a lovely floral grapefruit essence imparted by the hops with a mild malt backbone.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  This is a perfect indicator of how tastes change. First time I tried this beer I thought it was a hopped up mess, but now I cannot get enough. Flavors are perfectly blended with some intense piney hops coupled with a mild malt sweetness.

Smells sweet, hoppy, very appetizing. Just a great hoppy aroma all around.  Taste is incredible. Definitely get a hop fix with this one, while not too overpowered or out of whack at all. Nice malt to balance it out. Great carbonation and mouthfeel. For the great full flavor it has it is still pretty darn drinkable.  Overall worth the hype it gets and then some.

Smell: all fresh hops in the nose, wish some resiny, piney notes.  Taste: hops take center stage, but the malt backs up well enough that this quite bitter beer isn't overwhelming. Hops have a decidedly spicey character to them, which along with the pine in the nose explains why this is a winter seasonal.  Mouthfeel: no complaints at all, smooth, good carbonation.  Drinkability: I'll be buying a lot of this come winter so I can enjoy it all year round! Great representative IPA to introduce the style to people.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Good looking beer. Nose is hops up front with sweet malt evident in the background. Taste is similar, very bitter right up front with a strong hops presence; its dry; on the swallow, flavor transitions to a well-balanced hops-to-malt flavor with a nice bitter finish. Mouth is watery, smooth, and mildly carbonated. Drinkability is good, perhaps a bit too bitter for me, but enjoyable nonetheless. I dont think a hop-head (which Im really not) would mind the bitterness.  Overall: Yeah, I like this one. Not quite as smoothly integrated throughout as DFH 90 minute, a little brash on the hops, but a darn fine IPA just the same.

The taste is very good typical of an IPA, Very strong sour bitter hops, grapefruit & lime, over power a very rich malt that does well it's self. The finish is all bitter hops.

140,1904,edmundfitzoil,4.32,"A 2005 edition of this brew that I poured into a stanard pint glass.  The beer poured a deep, lightly reddish amber with a finger of head that retained through half the drinking. The nose was very piney, spicy hops. The flavor was intensely spicey, hoppy flavor. I can see how this beer would work very well during the winter months, which is originally when I bought the two six packs this one eminated from. The beer's hoppines sits well in a medium bodied ale with enough of a maltiness to prevent it from being grossly unbalanced, but the beer is a masterpiece of piney hoppiness. A true contrast to other IPA's like Two Hearted. This is a super drinkable beer though because of its flavor (I like the hops) and also because of its medium body and light alcohol taste at the finish of a sip of this ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kimcgolf,3.8,"Poured to a fairly hazy reddish orange color. Very good aroma.. a mixture of fruits (mostly apples), cinnamon and other spices, and chocolate. A spicy and bitter IPA.

Taste: Bitter citrus throughout with a little malt for balance.  Mouthfeel: For some reason this seems a little thinner than it should be.  Drinkability: A tasty beer, good for transitioning into the heavier fall and winter beers after drinking lighter stuff through the summer.  This is a pretty solid beer, but the mouthfeel really seemed thin for an IPA. It might be due to the age, but this was in my fridge and not my ""cellar"" so I don't think it went bad. It's still a good beer, but I feel it's better when it's fresher.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The foam dissolves slowly leaving behind a lot of lace on the glass. A very hoppy aroma of orange citrus and apricot hovers over the beer.  Each sip of this medium bodied beer is smooth on the palate. The flavor is mostly citrus hops with notes of orange and apricot. Some spicey notes are mixed in as well.

T: This is one amazing beer. Taste is mostly hop bitterness, but with enough malt sweetness and grapefruit to keep it balanced. Well done.  M: A little thicker and stickier than your typical IPA, a little more like a DIPA here.  D: Amazing. All the big tastes of a DIPA, but at 6.8%, you can drink it like a IPA.

Aromas are citrusy, piney hops and bready, biscuity yeast.  Medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,NolateM,4.21,"I could tell I was gonna like this one as soon as I poured it. It had a beautiful copper color and a nice thick white head that lingered the whole time, and pretty decent lacing.  The aroma was good - the alcohol was present in the smell, as well as strong hops, but as with most beers, didn't really make much of a difference for me in how much I liked the beer.  The taste was fantastic. I didn't even know it was an IPA before I bought it, and was pleasantly surprised as soon as I tasted it and went ""WOW! That's my kinda beer!"" Super tasty bitter hop presence, a bit of a spicy feeling on the sides of the tongue, and grapefruity piney goodness. A bit of a fruitlike sweetness, or sweetlike fruitness if you will? It did taste/feel a bit stronger than 6.8% though, which is where it lost points on the mouthfeel/drinkability bit.  This beer rules. I just feel bad recommending it to you since it's hard to find now that winter is over, but if you can still find it - well, don't worry about the 2005 at the top, IT'S STILL GOOD!

A thick layer of slightly off white lacing coats the surface and leaves sticky blotches on the side of the glass.  First note that hits the nose is nutty and buttery notes, perhaps a bit of toffee, but maybe not as sweet. Some fruits linger in the back, apples perhaps.  The buttery nutty notes are all over the front of the toungue and as the beer begins to roll back in your mouth a bit of pine bite starts to enter the equation. Some spiciness rolls around as well  Medium body with a rather low ammount of carbonation, some what round in the mouth finishes dry with a bit of a filmy residue lingering in the mouth.

140,1904,trep,4.33,"From the 2005 batch. Not very fresh, but I had it a bunch of times earlier and the year and it was a lot better as i remember it.  Looks pretty damn good. Frothy white head sitting atop a orange-amber body. Semi-cloudy body but able to see through it. Head fades into chunky white globs around the top of the glass, leaving a little lacing.  Smells of very faint pine and citrus. Grapefruity esters make themselves present. A good bit of alcohol presence for the 6.8% that it boasts. Seems as though I remember it as having a better nose when it was fresh, which makes sense.  Tastes about like it smells, bitter up front, but super smooth in the finish. Aftertaste contains a glimmer of pine and citrus.  Perfect mouthfeel for this beer. Not too thick, not too thin. A wonderful balance that coats your mouth and then evaporates into oblivion.

Taste - the malt has gone a little lifeless but the hops help out considerably. I've had this fresh and it is intense and alive when new. It is more like a pale ale now, tasty but not as zippy. Ends with a nice bite and turns nicely dry.  Mouthfeel - still fairly crisp and medium-bodied.

Pours much hazier than a fresh one, but still retains its head and lacing. Nose grew more delicous than ever, the hops toned down, with ripe fruits and a sweet, caramel maltiness that hides the alcohol in there. Hops have mellowed down in taste too, replaced by a deliciously smooth caramel malt, and is just a beautiful ride.

There is average head retention and lacing. This beer is nicely hopped and very aromatic.  The taste is very complex and different food pairings reveal different flavors. This beer is suprisingly drinkable considering its spiciness and ABV.  Up there with Mendocino as one of the best winter seasonals.  My only complaint would be its limited release. It becomes very difficult to find toward the end of January.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jhollick,4.14,"Presentation - 12 oz. bottle, served chilled. 2005 edition.  Appearance - Reddish orange with beatiful billowing white head. The head piles up around an inch, and leaves a thick trail behind. The whole scene reminds me of winter.  Smell - Cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, banana, and other spices my nose cannot identify. There is also a noticable hop aroma wafting around. Something tells me I'm in for something a bit out of the ordinary for winter warmer beers.  Mouthfeel - Nothing too out of the ordinary here. Appropriate carbonation level and enough heft to keep it from feeling watery. Hops coat the mouth a bit, but nothing overwhelming.  Taste - As I suspected, this beer is hoppier than other winter beers I have come across. The aforementioned spices make a brief appearance, but they quickly give way to the hops. The hops are pretty strong, but not overpowering, and somehow the beer stays smooth. The malts do just enough to keep those crazy hops in line. A very interesting flavor with a dry finish.  Drinkability - Woo woo! After this review, I finished 3 more out of the six pack and wondered why I couldn't see straight. Riiight...its the 6.8% alcohol. Seriously, that should be in big script, because I would have never known if I hadn't started buzzing very quickly.  Overall - A winter brew for hopheads! Not that this can only be enjoyed by hopheads. Even though the hops are the strongest flavor, they don't overwhelm, and the beer has a very quenching character. It had me reaching for more and more. Too bad this is only a seasonal. I could see myself reaching for this on a chilly summer's evening as well.

Herbal hops aroma out front, with a slightly sweet character that reminds me of cherries soaked in a brown sugar glaze.  Taste is pretty close to the regular S.N. Pale Ale, adding a fruitier aspect and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Piney hops out front, just a bit sharp but thirst-quenching and drinkable. Aftertaste is a steely grapefruit wang that sticks around awhile.  A satisfactory and hoppier take on their everyday (and very good) Pale Ale. There are better holiday ales, but the lower ABV (by holiday ale standards) makes it a good alternative if you're not looking to get blitzed 'n' bleary-eyed over the holidays.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste: Big and hoppy but super-smooth! A floral hoppy attack up front that is backed by a huge caramel malt backbone. This 2002 edition has mellowed out a lot, but lost some of its hop edge.  Mouthfeel: Ultra smooth despite the hoppiness and light to medium bodied. Lightly carbonated.  Drinkability: I wish I would have picked up another one of these! Very drinkable, smooth and well-balanced.  Picked up this 2002 edition at Blue Max last week and it did not disappoint.

I picked up a keg of Celebration Ale in January and enjoyed many wintery nights with friends while consuming mass quantities.  First off, this beer pours real nice and smooth from the tap. Little head and scenty aroma. It just seems to smell like you've just lit the fire on a winter night. Dark amber color in the glass, the first taste is a bit strong, but the second is delicious.  After a couple, the 6.8% ABV becomes obvious and you can either sit back and relax or ride the wave. I've done both on several occasions, however, this beer for me is a sit back and relax type of brew. I found that its much more enjoyable to hang back with a couple than pound this beer.  In summary, I love it in small quantities, but overdose can release undesirable effects.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

But it does have its moments. I don't think it compares well to the Troegs Nugget Nectar nor the Three Floyds Alpha King. But it's a good beer all in all.  I gave the smell a good-plus because it's a got a nice aroma that probably supercedes its taste a bit. I gave the mouthfeel and drinkability a good-minus because it's a tad too bitter for me. The taste is good, though it does leave an extremely long hop/bitter taste lingering in the mouth that doesn't do much good for this beer. I'm not sold on its outstanding classification on the site.

The head is a creamy white color...it was very thick at first, but dissipated quickly....a fine lace of cream colored bubbles remain around the glass.  The smell is what I consider to be the 'Sierra' smell....strong cascade hops. very dank and spicy.  This beer tastes like a stronger version of the pale ale. The hops hit the tongue and never leave(this is a good thing since I have started to love hops)....Almost like a mild IPA, but has the slight spice, and maybe some herbs, of a winter warmer(no spice added, just the slightly spiced taste). A nice bitter dry finish.  Mouthfeel/drinkablity: If you are a fan of Sierra Nevada already this is a great beer. I think that sierra nevada has a very distinct flavor going on and this appears to be due to their hops. I will have no problem finishing the rest of these....I find it is wonderful...I'm glad I got to try it before it is gone for the season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,joeyels,3.98,"2005 Edition  Dark copper or light amber in color depending how the light hits it. Tiny bubbles rushing to the top of a thin 1/4"" beige head, light lacing throughout the entire glass. Subtle aroma, very balanced with hops and malt. Taste is hoppy, feels like a mix of pine and citrus on the back end, but very balanced with sweetened malt. Very smooth, crisp finish, perfect feel on the palate, extremely well carbonated. Wonderful balance of flavors, not too subtle yet not too overpowering. Delicious.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,timtheenchanta,4.2,Hazy orange glow emitted from this beer. Medium head with little retention but good thin webby lacing.  Citrus hops with sweet pale malt smell.  Lots of hop oil flavor. Citrus hops and pale malt. Great IPA with plenty of delicious hoppiness. Hop dryness leaves me wanting more.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,wl0307,4.47,"&lt;2007 Vintage&gt; BB 08/10/2008, served slightly chilled in a large tulip-shaped wine glass. A: dark amber hue, coming with creamy off-white head with o.k. retention, on top of very decent-looking, gentle carbonation. S: a little musk, Fuggle-like fragrance, and the smell of ""old kitchen-cloth"" (quite typical in many English Pale Ales) come as surprising plus to the original mixture of peachy+piney+fat-grapefruity hops in this fantastic ale; this years vintage seems to feature less malts and the fragrant hops come more pronounced and intense than the 2005 Vintage that I can recall Complex and super-enjoyable! T: grapefruit-zesty, tannic-bitter as well as deliciously and yet also soothingly malty upfront the piney hoppiness is rather light, being slightly spicy in the middle, then the citric hop bitterness expand towards the wings and rear of the tongue with a lychee-like fruity undertone. The finish is proudly bitter, but quite rounded and not harsh at all, with a wee bit of alc. felt in the very end. M&D: fantastic mouthfeel, with lots and lots of soothing carbonation to carry through the weight of hop bitterness; this vintage tastes slightly different from my last bottle (2005 vintage), with a slightly more hop-dominated theme. No matter what the subtle differences are, I just love every vintage of this truly delicious festive IPA!  &lt;2005 Vintage&gt; BB 21/10/06, served slightly chilled in a large tulip-shaped wine glass. A: light copperish hue, coming with a medium-thick, 2cm off-white creamy head with good retention and uneven sheets of lacing; lively carbonation, but not too fizzy. S: barley candy and a raw-grainy hint of sweet calcium-pill (for children) upfront; deeply sweet flowery fragrance with lots of stimulating pollens, like orange blossoms, plus cherry and apple flavouring, honey, sweetened citrus peel... plus a dense aroma from fruit and flower esters sustaining firmly in the background. Oily and flowery hoppyness threads through all elements of the aroma. Very nice, even more complex than the 2004 version, or maybe I've gained more experience to appreciate a good brew like this?? T: extremely creamy-textured semi-sweet fruity palate with fat maltiness lubricates the palate, preparing it for a quiet but colourful hoppy attack--grapefruit peel, lychee, cherry skins, flowery, orange seeds, plus an increasingly bitter hoppy aftertaste with plenty of tannins at the back... The flavour outperforms the aroma in terms of depth and complexity by a margin, and really is penetrating just like a colourful American IPA should be. Superbly lingering bitterness and dancing hops on the palate. M&D: full flavoured and very approachable due to its creamy texture; again, the 2005 version is another successful brew proving the consistency of the brewery's artistic skills. Incredibly juicy and exceptionally delicious American IPA. Can't wait to try the 2006 vintage~~",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,brentk56,4.27,"Appearance: Pours a clear amber color with a lovely head that leaves plenty of lacing  Smell: Wonderful citrus orange aroma  Taste: Although this beer is very hoppy, it has a nice caramel malt backbone that supports the citrusy hop flavors; it gives you a nice sweetness up front alongside a long bitter flavor, with a floral aftertaste  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation  Drinkability: Always a seasonal favorite, this one has a great hoppy taste and is extremely well-balanced",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A clear, mahogany beer, with very little dark khaki head, leaves a little Brussels lace down the glass.The smell is of hops, wonderful hops, with some malt as well. The taste is of hops as well, along with raisins and clove. Thanks goes out to Fritz, for this wonderful product. The mouthfeel is of balance, like no other, tis perfect.

140,1904,Billolick,4.55,"2000 vintage Celebration ale, from Sierra Nevada  I was lucky enough to find a sixer of this stunning beer from the 2000 vintage at Route 59 Beverages in Nyack NY. With a full five years in the bottle, this one now is a soft dark auburn stunner. Smooth mouthfeel, nose of subtle brandy and piney hops. Mouthfeel is pure velvet. Notes of smokey brandy, pine sap, vanilla and rum soaked blondies, yum. A few years in the bottle and the flavors are soft, balanced and meshed. Put Celebration away for a few years and you will have some wonderful, soft and smooth stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kgotcher,4.22,"So first off I'ma bit confused if this is IPA or Double IPA or American Strong Ale. Says IPA on the BA style but I've reviewed other beers just like that that were IIPA or Strong Ale or Winter warmers.  Anyway, this pours nice rich orange amber color with thin head and nice lacings. Smell is sweet malt with Christmas tree hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy with a bitter finish. Very hoppy with a good amount of carbonation.  Taste is amber malt with northwest hops. Earthy and citrusy hops rule over a sweet syrupy malt and a slight nutty flavor. Leans toward hop flavor in the end with overpowering finishing hops.  A nice beer, pretty drinkable for the style with lots of flavor. If anything a bit too hoppy, but that's typical SN for you.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,rhoadsrage,4.05,( Served in an American pint glass)  A- This beer has a light golden orange body that is crystal clear. There is a good strong carbonation of tiny bubbles and a thin creamy white head.  S- The smell of green hops with a pineapple note and a hint of grass is supported by a lightly toasted and caramel malt note.  T- The grapefruit hops come through and appear a bit more bitter with the slight sweetness of the malt. This really makes the hops stand out nicely. This beer finishes with a green bitter hops flavor and a note of spicy in the hops.  M- This beer has a medium-full mouthfeel with a nice creamy texture.  D- The hops are really enhanced by the malt but this beer is still very drinkable.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Tupperwolf,4.18,"Here's a little story about Celebration Ale.  One day, I was driving down a street just a few blocks from my home in San Diego. I was following a white Toyota Celica being driven by a woman who appeared to be around 65 years of age. She slowed, turned on her turn signal, and used her remote to open her garage door. As I slowed behind her, I looked into her garage and was surprised to see an entire wall of the garage stacked with box after box of Celebration - probably 15-20 cases of it. Since then, I've wondered if it was really good enough to warrant stocking up to that level for your family.  Pouring this into a standard pint glass reveals a fairly standard IPA - red-amber, with rising bubbles and a rocky, fluffy eggshell head. This is a bit more hazy than a standard IPA, however, a slight cloudiness that could just be chill haze. The head leaves an amazing lacing across the entire glass, from top to bottom, that I can't help but wonder is caused by an extremely clean glass or a slightly dirty glass. It is a wall of thick, bubbly lace that looks like styrofoam.  Smell - slight spruce-tip winter-ale spiciness in the beginning, and it's all hop from there. This is one hoppy winter bomb, floral and citrusy.  The taste echoes the flavor rather well - It begins with a caramelly malt that continues to a sprucey, spicy winter warmer flavor, and is almost immediately overwhelmed by sweet, sweet oily hops. Yum yum. Citrusy and oily, the hops are well balanced.  Smooth mouthfeel, very slight carbonation, oily hop finish, nearly clean at the end after swallowing.  Pretty good. Definitely drinkable. Hell, I had four in a row.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,scottoale,4.92,"One of my top 5 favorites for nearly 2 decades, I thoroughly enjoy this American IPA which IMO is just as much a strong ale. Really, really tasty stuff no matter how you look at it!  It pours a medium amber-gold with an outstanding almond colored head. The head is thick and frothy, lasting the entire time of consumption, with a nice sticky lacing trailing every sip. The bottle-conditioned carbonation is perfact and consistant, year after year.  Ah, the smell. Very piney fresh hop nose with floral, malty into citrus like finish. They should make air fresheners and perfumes using this fragrance.  Tastes just like it smells with a rich, full body that makes this a gourmet meal of a beer. Full of hoppy, malty mouthfilling goodness that hides the alcohol all to well. Must drink more! One helluva American IPA indeed, and a very well balanced one.  I truly can say nothing bad about this beer, even though it's filling, I can drink this strong ale into eternity...I recommend that you do the same...Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I have a 2003 in the freg. it will brought out before 2006 is over to compare!

Think SNPA but better! Hops reside in the front of the palate, and a robust yet manageable bitterness rides through to the long finish. There is enough malt to keeps things in balance for the most part, but make no mistake this beer is all about the hops!  Not only is Celebration Ale absolutely delicious in its own right, it's also a most welcome change from the (often pedestrian) winter offerings rolled out during holiday time.  Let it also be noted that it's no secret SNCA holds up surprisingly well to cellaring. Not long ago I participated in a multi-year vertical and they were all fantastic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Freshie,3.81,"Served on-tap at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth, MA.  Served very cold with small head that dissapated at a moderate pace. Dark amber colour. I had a hard time getting a sense of the aroma, and I am not sure why. I had a few other beers on this occasion and had no problem with the aroma. What I did smell was pine hops and citrus, though it really took alot of intake to get it.  The taste was very hoppy and gave way to a more floral bouquet. I tasted citrus, pine and other earthy textures. The hop character stays with you as you drink it, but I don't consider that a bad thing! haha.  Good quality all around.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Toasted brown sugar, light sweet maltiness under the hops, fruity - definite grapefruit notes, raisins, figs, floral notes...  Feel - Quite sharp and dry. Medium body. Very drinkable...

140,1904,Jredner,3.5,Nice hop aroma. Pours very nice with a frothy white head on a copper body. Citrus notes follow a mild malt profile and big hops are present through out. A less in your face IPA which is more to my personal style. Still was kinda sad there was no cinnamon or fruitcake flavors cause when I see snow on a bottle I think spiced ale :-(,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dreadnatty08,4.3,"Pours a dark amber with soapy, bubbly head about 1/2"" which receeds to a slight covering. Slightly sweet, piney, fruity (citrus) in the nose. Flavor is dominated by those signature SN hops. Light body with a little alcohol bite in the finish. Not sure what makes an IPA a winter seasonal, but this is a pleasure to drink to remind myself what makes this style so great among the standard winter fare.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,KyleVick4,2.62,"A: Very bubbly, copper amberish color. Nice head that consists of big bubbles. Head dissipates pretty quickly. Leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  S: Hoppy. Can not distinguish any subtle smells bc the hop aroma is to big. Not a very strong smelling beer, but I could only pinpoint one smell.  T: Spicy, and dry with a kick of mild hops coming in the end. The combination of carbonation and hops makes for a spicy first hit followed by a hoppy aftertaste. Very little malt taste, kinda weakly IPAish.  M: Medium - Light with a fair amount of carbonation.  D: Overkill on spicyness and carbonation makes this beer tough for me to finish. It would for sure be a one beer drink for me, Id drink it again bc it tastes good but it gets old quickly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kingjames1,4.38,"Wow. This is beautiful. Pours a deep orange-amber (the color of honey) with a solid, thick off-white head. Smells of bitter grapefruit rine, pine needles, and spice. MMM. The taste is wonderfully complex, and the thick and sweet malts present stronger as the drink warms. A wonderful beer that simply gets better with each sip. Great to sip slowly and really appreciate, or refreshing to drink relatively quickly as one would a standard IPA such as Harpoon. This may be my favorite IPA, and one of my favorite seasonal offerings. Fantastic. I'm buying up as many as I can before they leave us until next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RJLarse,4.07,"I picked up a couple of these at a local craft beer store to review. Its getting a little late for the seasonal ales, so it might have been marked down. I poured this beer into a pint tumbler.  Pours a shiny copper color and is slightly cloudy but translucent. The pour generates three fingers plus of foamy off-white head with a bit of a yellow tinge. The head is extremely resilient. In fact there is foam in the bottom of the glass after the last swallow.  The smell is pungent and acerbic. The beer has a citrus smell and a sharp distinct aroma of hops.  The taste is also sour and citrusy, like grape fruit. This is a very hoppy tasting beer. The aftertaste lingers briefly and is also mildly sour.  Mouth feel is light, crisp and mildly carbonated. The beer is refreshing and festive in the mouth.  This is a very drinkable beer, with a distinct and festive character. Its not a typical winter beer, but its light and lively and would certainly spice up a holiday party. Celebration Ale would be good year round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SwillBilly,4.33,"2005 Celebration Ale, poured from 12 oz bottle:  Appearance: Pours a light copper hue, with a 2""-3"" creamy, white head. Carbonation bubbles stream to the top of the glass. Plenty of spider web like lacing lines the glass.  Smell: Herbal and grassy with hints of piney hops and sweet caramel.  Taste: Initially a piney, herbal hop bitterness dominates the beginning. The middle transistions nicely to a faintly caramel like sweetness. The finish leaves a nice, dry bitterness on the palate.  Mouthfeel: Pleny of carbonation makes for a lively mouthfeel. Somewhat slick and oily.  Drinkability: SNCA is what I consider a quintessential American IPA. A beer that I look forward to every year. That being said, its very well balanced, plenty of hoppy bitterness as well as a mildly caramel like sweetness in the middle. A beer that I could drink all day. Highly sessionable even with the 6.8% abv, which is very well hidden. Can't wait for next years edition.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,evh883,4.1,"The best American IPA I have ever had! In the glass, the beer has a nice medium amber glow to it with a white head that laces fairly well upon drinking. Very hoppy aroma that is expected with the style. The taste is backed up with more hoppiness and a harsh bitterness which gives it a sharp finish on the tongue. Great beer, would definetely look forward to next year's.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,yelterdow,3.98,"2005 Edition, served in a pint glass at fridge temperature. This is such a classic brew, I couldn't waste another day without lending my two cents.  Appearance- Glows a bright, beautiful orange in the glass, supporting a creamy bone white head that laps at the rim after a good, solid pour. Lacing happens in sheets, not islands or craggy masses like some other IPAs. Terrific structure, it never loses its rugged character.  Smell- Sweet, piney grapefruit hop presence right out of the bottle, which intensifies and grows over the course of my tasting. A firm malty note lingers within, giving some weight to the nose.  Taste- A blast of lemon and grapefruit envelop the mouth, giving way to a short but certain malt appearance... then the relentless hops take over and clusterbomb the back and sides of the tongue. The bitterness left behind is staggering, yet I can't wait for the next attack.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The most important need for improvement IMHO is the mouthfeel... it is rough, and the carbonation slightly hurts the drinkability. I'm loving the burps right now, no problems there... I feel terrible that my sweet, loving wife has to deal with my bedtime etiquette tonight. All in all, an unmistakeable IPA that will continue to have a home in my beer cellar 'til the Hop Gods come for the keys.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PBRstreetgang,4.38,"2005 release. Pours a hazy shade of copper,with a massive three finger head crowning over very active tiny carbonation. Very dense foam shows excellent retention and leaves rings of sticky lace. Hoppy nose, pine and citrus and a slight herbal/earthy aroma. Toasted amber malt first, then raw american hops take over the flavor leaving a coarse yet satisfying aftertaste. Herbal and bitter, it balances well with the sweet amber malt flavor. The medium body and high carbonation smooth out the onslaught of hop oils and the mouthfeel turns out rich instead of harsh with a surprisingly mild finish. An outstanding IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,wingnutter,4.26,"Re-review.  I first had this 2 months ago, and after probably 3 cases, I think I need to revisit this wonderful beer.  I drink so much of this, I usually drink it from the bottle - its just as good as in a glass. I may even like it a bit better. I have 2 cases sitting in my closet so I can enjoy this stuff all year. This 4th of July is gonna be a great time for a Celebration.  This is THE quintessential piney IPA. Excellent aggressive, piney hops with enough sweetness to balance it perfectly. Very green tasting, which is a good thing in my book. The amount of carbonation matches well with the taste - the meduim mouthfeel never feels too light or gets too heavy. Feels like pine resin on my tongue and has an oily base. Brilliant. I never get sick of this beer. It still stings my tastebuds every time I take a sip.  The flavor has highlights that come and go as you drink it- piney, floral, citrusy, grassy...theyre all covered. The subtle malt backbone provides stability to the in-your-face hoppiness, and the hops used in this beer is one of the most refreshing yet bold I have come across. Ive tried quite a few IPAs in the last 11 months (including such heavyweights as Stone, Racer 5, Avery, Dogfish Head, Titan, HopDevil, Hop Ottin, etc), and this one stands up to every one of them and ranks in my top 5.  Rediculous drinkability. I would love to try this straight from the source on tap.  If youre looking for a standard to compare other IPAs against this one is as solid as they come.  Bravo, Sierra Nevada. You nailed it in 05. I hope next years offering is as good as this one. A near perfect beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Pour was very nice, a clear amber with fluffy ivory head  plenty of sticky laces all the way down the glass.  Strong floral hints did not bode well for the quaff, and yep, very hoppy brew, almost like an APA. No winter spices or enough malts to balance it out  but since this is an AIPA, suppose it meets the style.

The bartender was a proud hop-head and is a lot more knowledgeable about beer than I am. A great chat as well as a surprise encounter with a familiar, top-notch beer. I didn't notice much difference between the draft and bottled versions. Bars are dark so my 56 year-old eyes didn't get to enjoy the apprearance as much as I do at home. The aroma, taste and mouthfeel are exactly the same as I encountered in my review of the bottled version.

140,1904,heyitsbyron,4.01,"Poured a single from Woodman's in Madison ($1.25--hell yeah!) into a tulip glass.  Celebration Ale is without a doubt the prettiest beer I've ever poured. The color of the stream is a wonderful blonde and in the glass it's a glowy, rusty but clear Triaminic syrup orange. The bubbles play around in the glass before forming a pillowy pale orangish head. It does lace well if that concerns you. Absolutely magnificent.  Smelled floral and like grapefruits as well. Pretty standard for an IPA, but well balanced and how it ""should"" smell.  Taste followed smell for the most part. It is piney, floral and citrusy. I also thought I tasted peppermint, but that's probably just a mental projection of mine. No malts to speak of, though it did have a slighty foody aftertaste, which, like Great Lakes Christmas Ale, is a good for a winter seasonal. To be honest, I was expecting more of a winter warmer style, but this was very well done for an IPA.  The most notable feature of the mouthfeel is the carbonation--very smooth entering the mouth. Not too heavy, and perhaps it should have been for a winter seasonal.  It's a great IPA, I'll grant them that. And it's a fun beer to have around the end of the year, but for a ""celebration"" I feel it's a bit too much of an IPA to be enjoyed in quantity with the family around the fire at the holidays. I'd be more than willing to buy it again, but just not necessarily for its intended consumption setting.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Bursting with hops. Overflowing, even. Tasty hops with a citrusy kick. The maltyness isn't soooo well-balanced with the hops, but it works. Mouthfeel is sudsy and smooth, fluffy and creamy.

The aroma is full of grapefruit and spicey hops with only a touch of malt sweetness. The flavor is very hoppy and it is just like the aroma with lots of grapefruit and spicy hops, the bitterness lingers along with the flavor well into the finish and the malt is hard to identify. The mouthfeel is good as the CO2 isn't too high which would make is seem too bitter and the viscosity of the beer give the impression that the beer is very full bodied.

It was a perfect shade of amber/orange with a nice head, looking like a perfect pale ale. Smell was complex, it was very sweet, a little juicy fruit, and intently appetizing.  Mouth was all ale. Thick, bitter, with a good finish and the taste , orange rhind bitter, flowery hops presence, that took up most of the flavor and there was barely any alcohol taste despite the high APV. Wow. This was excellent.

Decent foam that hides to the edge of the glass and good lacing.  The smell is not overwhelming but still noticeable. Good hop notice that is mostly piney with some earthy smells kicked in. Overall it's light for an IPA. The malt is worth mentioning as it has a really grainy smell to it.  The taste is more noticeable then the nose. The bittering hops are first to really take notice. A good bite that isn't overbearing. A good bitterness the isn't too oily but pushes the limit and. Although it seems to dominate the rest of the beer. The malt is rather basic and doesn't really support the rest of the beer. The flavoring hops play second as well. Tastes more of a ESB then IPA.  The body is light but the beer is easy enough to drink. Other then the bitterness there is nothing wrong.

Fresh cascade hops are strong and the flavor is quite bitter all the way through. Hard to detect much sweetness from the malt. Very crisp and smooth with a medium body. Again, well carbonated. Alcohol is well-hidden. Very drinkable, but be ready for some bitter hops.  2007 Version (reviewed 1-21-08)  Deep gold color with excellent clarity. Massive pillowy head almost an inch thick, with perfect streams of carbonation rising from below helping to sustain it. Fresh piney hop aroma with a wildflower and citrus bouquet. The malt is only hinted at with some caramel notes which are more tangy than sweet.  Straightforward bitter hop flavor with some toasty malt balance carries on right through to the finish. It never gets too sweet but the bitterness lingers on nicely. The characteristic SN Cascade hops are bright and clean, and this beer is not as citrusy/resiny as you would expect for an American IPA. Medium body with a great deal of foamy carbonation that keeps it from feeling too watery, not bad.  Overall a great beer from Sierra Nevada. A little bit more in the way of flavor than the Harvest Ale, although overall not quite as drinkable. Excellent, hoppy, beer...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Drew966,3.6,"Pours a nice copper color with a fluffy head. Strong hop smell and taste. I couldn't drink too much of this, bit hoppier than I would want for a session beer, but it is a tasty brew, especially for those liking a nice hoppy taste. Definitely worth a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ericj551,3.88,"Appearance: deep orange with a one finger head.  Smell: Strong piney hops with a slight graininess.  Taste: Nice strong bitterness, with lots of grapefruit and piney flavor to back it up. The hops are almost spicy. Malts are secondary, and barely manage to poke their way through.  Mouthfeel: For the strength and hopiness of this beer, the mouthfeel is still fairly light.  I look forward to this beer every year. I always hear that it was ""much better last year,"" but this is only my second year tasting this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,badturtle,3.8,"This is a seasonal that should have a big warning on the said saying, ""Wait at least a month."" I bought this in mid December. I was going to review it then, but I'm glad I didn't.  When I first poured it, I was impressed by the massive foamy head. It had an overpoweringly hoppy scent, but I wouldn't call that a bad thing. When I opened my first bottle, I thought it tasted terrible. I like hoppy beers and especially IPAs, but this was too much. Tonight, it has aged about a month. The hop bitterness has lessened enough to make the spices and the orange taste noticeable. Now, it is a good beer.  Even after aging, it is a little strong tasting. Sierra Nevada seems to be over-hopped on everything I have tried from them. This is no exception. I'll drink it again. I'll buy the '06 release when it comes out. I won't make a session out of it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jaluria,4.2,"I had a very different impression of this beer when I had it on-tap at the Galaxy Hut in Arlington than when I had it from a bottle. Appeared a lovely golden-orange with yellow hues in my pint glass. Aromas of pine, grass, citrus, and hops were evident, but this time they worked very well together to create a bitter, hoppy smell. The taste was just terrific with loads of hops just jumping all over my tongue. Initial hop bitterness grows ever so slightly with each sip leaving behind an aftertaste that beckons you to take another sip. Just delightful! Some malt is present, but not much compared to the hops. Very good drinkability because of it's moderate ABV and flavorful character.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PatYoda,4.05,"2005 Version.  I decided to review this because I made a comment in a thread recently about it being overhyped, but realized that I hadn't had the '05 version yet, so I popped this baby open with an open mind - and I was pleasantly surprised. It was better than last years.  The appearance is nearly perfect. Beautiful shade of copper / amber with a great cream colored head that never completely fades. A little bit of lacing and this would have been a 5.0.  The smell smacks you in the face with fresh hops. Citrus rind and floral aromas are in full force. Some caramel malt is there in the background. Alcohol also makes a bit of an appearance, ever so slightly.  The taste is even more unbalanced than the smell would suggest. What little caramel malt there is here does help to keep this beer drinkable (unlike Bigfoot), but other than that, this is unabashedly hoppy. The citrus and earthy floral hops combine and rise to a crescendo of hoppiness toward the end of the sip, when the strong bitterness and pine flavor kicks in as well. Alcohol is noticeable but doesn't detract. A tad grainy on the aftertaste due to all the hops, but this is its only real flaw.  While all the hops lend to the illusion of a little harshness in the mouthfeel, the overall feeling is still pretty good. It's medium bodied with adequate carbonation.  I could probably drink two in one night, but that would be my breaking point. Definitely one to pick up next year though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Chadbrew,4.18,"I've never had this beer before but I had heard alot about it. Sweet and spicy with a definite bitter finish. This is very smooth in the beginning, so smooth that it is easy to overlook some of the subtle complexities that are thrown in here. There seems to be very light hints of orange peel, nutmeg, and maybe cinnamon. The hops come through rather boldly with a piney finish and a slightly lingering aftertaste. This is bitterer than I expected considering most fall/winter seasonals tend to be malty and over spiced IMO. I will be seeking this out in forthcoming seasons as I find this a very delightful and drinkable beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jimdkc,4.32,"What a difference a couple of years makes! I first tried Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale about 2 years ago when I first joined BA. At the time, I don't think I was quite ready for it. I very slowly sipped the strong nectar... intrigued... but a bit intimidated, and I don't think I finished my serving.  This year, I tried the 2005 version:  Poured into a brandy snifter a slightly hazy, copper-orange with a off-white foamy head. Head did not last long, and there was no lacing.  Aroma is dominated by piney and citrusy hop notes. The snifter concentrated these aromas nicely.  Taste, again... this is a hop showcase, right up front. Grapefruit, some pine, a bit of earthiness. Very nice. Lingering hop bitterness at the back of the tongue. Some crystal malt sweetness also makes an appearance.  Medium bodied mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Appropriate for this style, I think.  Good drinkability. While I couldn't finish my first one two years ago, I have no such problem now! Gimme another!  No more intimidation! Celebration Ale will be a brew I look forward to every year, now!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RedHaze,4.23,"Pours a clear red/copper color with a thick two finger head that settles to a thin cap. There's quite a bit of lacing left behind in my glass. I really like the color of this beer.  Smell; lots of piney and citrus smells, and it has a really nice spiciness to it that I didn't quite expect.  Taste; initially starts out a little sweet, and then the hops kick in with a strong piney bitterness, and it finishes with that spiciness. Mouthfeel is meium bodied and slick from the hop oils. Very easy to drink as long as you enjoy hops, and I do. Overall this is a very enjoyably IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,redwolf1,4.12,"Poured a 12 ounce bottle of Sierra Nevada's 2005 edition of Celebration Ale. A very nice golden amber color with a rather huge frothy head that stuck around awhile. Very good lacing along the edge of the glass. A strong, but not overpowering, hoppy aroma that somehow started out a little fruity and then mellowed. The aroma itself literally made me salivate. The amount of hops in this beer explodes in the mouth (really meant for those who love their hops). A nice crisp finish to the beer, in spite of the level of hops present. A very drinkable beer in itself, but I'm not sure if I would have more than one in a sitting. The amount of hops used may mask the flavors and aromas of other beers one would want to enjoy afterwards.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,skillerified,2.68,"Orange-amber brew with a good sized, white, foamy head. Looks a little hazy actually. Lots of carbonation coming up from the bottom of this one. Looks pretty good.  Scent is malt first, then a little spicyness, and then a citrusy hop scent. Aside from the early malt aroma, it's really dominated by the fruit scents. It's a good smell, but not a wow kinda smell either.  Taste reminds me of a non-sugary breakfast cereal. There's a hint of the spicyness too. Not too impressive actually. I had hoped for more.  This feels like a horrible off-balance brew to me. There's a light sweetness early on, but there's an awful bitterness on the finish. I like beers with a bitter character, but this is a strange bitterness that is not appealing to me. It's a bitterness that coats the inside of the mouth and is devastating when you dry swallow after a sip.  It seems to be getting better as it warms, but I really don't want another of these. I'll finish this bottle, but won't be looking for this one next holiday season. This seems to be quite popular, so I guess it's just my particular palate that this doesn't agree with. This was a 2005 bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It has a great spicy taste, and is also fairly hoppy. I think the bottled version is more hoppy than the one on tap. Either way, a great beer that can be enjoyed any time.

Anyway, poured a crisp, clear, light amber with very good carbonation, medium, off-white head, and nice lacing.

Very tasty brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TreeTopFlyer,4.34,"Hops, hops and more hops. This one reminds me of an IPA I tasted in Boise, ID from a taphandle labeled in masking tape and Sharpie magic marker.

140,1904,brewingmonk,4.22,"What a great seasonal brew! The amber color and lacy head was begging to be enjoyed, and enjoyed it was. There were smells of citrus and hints of caramel malts, which led to a sweet taste before the hops came in. It felt light inside the mouth, and was very drinkable. Actually, for the amount of hops present, this beer was extremely drinkable- which is what I would label its best quality.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,DevilDogBeer,4.87,"Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale was poured from the tap into a pint glass. The color was a great copper hue with a thin head. The head faded into a thin top layer but left some lacing down the glass. The smell was a combination of caramel malts and wonderful spicy hops. The taste was hoppy on the tongue and finished with a light caramel note. The brew was crisp and did not leave any off flavors on the palate. Very drinkable and very satisfying, this is a great choice and I highly recommend trying one if you have the chance.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,skynxnex,4.47,"2005 vintage poured into a snifter. A nice bright orange amber color. Off white head that laces well. This bottle had a bit of well packed sediment that didn't pour into the beer, leaving it very clear.  Smell is hops: piney, sweet citrus lemon, but also a good sweet backing peaking around. The taste, again, is hops. But that's what this beer is. The citrus falls away in the flavor, but the wonderful piney hops rush forward. It finishes with the bitterness of the hops playing around (maybe fighting it out) with the good amont of sweet malt that you notice just at the end. A bit of toasty malt hints through as the beer warms. A great beer to drink and is very drinkable at 6.8% ABV.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,deciding39,4.23,"2005 edition, served in a 16 oz tumbler.  A: Pours a clear, brassy amber. A fluffy, rocky-looking, two-finger white head is left after the pour. A perfect lace clings to the sides of the glass, leaving rings behind after each sip.  S: A bouquet of aromatic hops and smooth toasted malts. Clean, bready yeast notes in the background.  T: A blend of smooth caramel malt sweetness and delicious piney, resinous hops. The trademark citrus/grapefruit notes of Cascade & Centennial hops linger on the palate, with a touch of spice. Well-balanced, if not a little on the hoppy side. Very clean, with little esters.  M & D: Medium-bodied, smooth mouthfeel. The hops sometimes become a little overwhelming after a few drinks, and the high alcohol content definitely limits the drinkability of this brew. A very well-crafted winter warmer. A nice change of pace from the usual over-spiced holiday ales.  One of my personal favorites. Outstanding. I hear it's even better when aged, but who could possibly hold onto this stuff long without drinking it?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,JerzDevl2000,4.4,"Picked this up at the liquor store in my town recently, in the midst of all the winter and holiday beers that I've been sampling. I'm a huge fan of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, so I eagerly anticipated this holiday offering. After downing half of the 6-pack I bought, I can honestly say that my expectations were met with flying colors!  All of the good qualties of the their flagship brew are present here. A wonderful pour - amber, bubbly, and with a wonderful floral aroma - is present here, and the lacing on the side of the glass is very remarkable as well. Floral, citrus, pine, and strong hop notes are present here, with a dry-hopped, pine, slight metallic, and oily aftertaste. It's not perfect, but it did warm me up and had the smoothness and subtlety of SNPA. Not too bold for me, but not as buttery and golden as the flagship brew. The lack of an overpowering hop bite is more than compensated by the muted notes of the background flavors, which work very harmoniously together. The flavor base is that of the SNPA, but unlike other beers which play off of the ""variations of a theme"" when it comes to seasonals and year-round concotions from the same brewer, there is enough of a difference between this and SN's other offerings. One will get the enjoyment of the Pale Ale's hops when drinking this, but there will be enough differentiation to make this beer stand out on it's own, as well.  I'd certainly buy this again and would put this near the top of the seasonal and holiday brews that I've consumed so far this year. Sierra Nevada's offerings never let me down and always amaze me with their quality, refining, and overall taste and aftertaste. A truly great IPA from a truly great brewery!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,assurbanipaul,4.36,"Pours a dark yet crystal clear amber with a half-inch-thick foamy head that settles only slightly. Aroma is rich, hoppy and spicy with a small amount of caramel malt.  Taste is a blend of rich, luxurious malt and sharp, bright hops. Some mild spices weave in an among the citrusy, juicy, floral hop nature. This is a beer equivalent of freshly baked bread with the hops springing forward without knocking you over. Very good job of balancing the flavors so that neither side crushes the palate.  Mouthfeel is a little heavy, a little oily, but in a good way. Lips remain sticky after the drink is finished. Oddly, drinkability remains high despite its bold flavors. This is the gold standard in American IPAs, one I have sessioned on many occasions.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,delicious,4.44,"Brewed in 2005  Pours a tall, fluffy head with a darker than amber body. The hoppy nose has a great citrusy aspect. The flavor is dominated by hops which leave a lingering bitterness after a bit of grapefruit and an initial hint of mandarin orange sweetness. This beer is full-bodied and surprisingly drinkable given the remarkable amount of hops. This marvelous beer does wonderful things with hops. It's interesting, tasty, and those hops really stay with you. ___ 2007 notes: Pours a clear amber body beneath a fluffy cream colored head that leaves lacing rings after each sip. Fresh, bitter, leafy hop nose. The flavor continues the pattern of dry bitterness. There's also a bit of citrus, but the bitterness is more prone to dehydrate the inside cheeks and tongue than to invoke any juicy analogies. I'd love to describe how this ale develops as it warms, but I sincerely doubt it will last that long. While I'm typing, the alcohol warmth begins to glow in my tummy and puts a smile on my face.

A dry, fruity, bitter taste that lingered a bit long after swallowing.  It left an aftertaste, and felt both dry and clingy at the same time.  This would be a good beer to have with some curry.

Reminds me of wheat toast with just a touch of cinnamon sugar.  Taste: Strong, very leafy hop character throughout. Some alcohol comes through along with a subtle flavor of pumpkin pie spice (clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.). Malts take a backseat, but somehow this beer is still on the sweet side.

140,1904,skizziks,4,"2005 Celebration Ale poured from a 12oz. bottle into a nonic. Well carbonated, formed a 2 inch fine, and slightly rocky, head. Foam was long lasting and left a small amount of lacework. Color was a medium copper with a hint of amber.  Aroma is predominately citrusy Cascade hop closely followed with crystal malt. Hops and malt combine to give a slight suggestion of cinnamon. Very nice.  Taste is pretty much the same as aroma. Smooth, slightly more than medium bodied mouthfeel carrying citrus and medium crystal malt. Finishes decidedly bitter. Bitterness sticks to the tongue, but isn't overpowering. Well-balanced with strong bittering appropriate to style.  Overall this is a very well-balanced beer for an American IPA and a very easy drinker. The alcohol is barely noticeable and the malt and hops are both well represented with neither overpowering the other. This is much like a bit heavier Sierra Pale Ale. A little more of everything, but is still refreshing enough to not wear out the palate. After recording my initial impressions, this beer was used to wash down a roasted garlic white pizza which had four heads of garlic in the sauce and topping. The Celebration Ale stood up to it and was very effective in keeping my palate scrubbed fresh. A great combination.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,misterscooter,3.65,"2005 offering.  I like what Sierra Nevada has done and they have some good beers. This one is a good beer but still not one that I just love. When I had one of their first batches several years ago, I hated it. Maybe they've refined their recipe over the years or my tastes have changed enough so that I don't hate it anymore.  An orange beer with a thick cream head. The lacing sticks to the side as the head slides down.  The smell is a piney bark, almost musky soap odor. Maybe a little spiced orange, too.  The taste is dry and very hoppy. Very woody in flavor with some nutmeg and spices in there for that ""winter"" feel. Warms you up as it goes down. The alcohol level means it doesn't take many to really feel warm.  It does alright but I still don't love it. Probably a little too woodsy for me. But definitely a good beer compared to a lot of the winter stuff out there.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jp32,4.59,"A: An aggressive pour creates a huge, frothy cream-colored head capping off a beer that is a nice bronze color. Leaves nice lacings all the way down the glass.  S: The nose is citrusy and piney. Oranges and Lime really stand out in the smell, lemons, and a little pineapple. Not fresh pineapple, but the kind that comes in a can. A sweeter version of hoppy.  T: That citrusy bittersweet-lime flavor really comes out in the taste. Lingers for a while in the aftertaste as well. Spicy and hoppy. The hop profile is wonderful. A very nice tasty and aromatic mix of citrus and floral hops. Quite extensive citrus flavors. Definitly has that tangy-ness on the sides of the tongue. Kick-ass Christmas time beer... Hell, this is a kick-ass ANYtime beer.  M: Excellent carbonation. A hair heavier and I'd call it medium-bodied. Its not thin or anything, actually very nicely done.  D: Awesome drinkability. Why did I only buy a single???  Quite similar to SNPA, maybe a tad fruitier? I've absolutely enjoyed this one, and will be enjoying it again as soon as I can.

The body goes down really easy with the hops adding a pleasant kick in the end. The mouthfeel is great as well, especially after you've had a few.

Taste - Hoppier than it smells. A little ""dirty"" in a good way. Hint of spice..nutmeg again? If I had to pick a fruit - Orange. Could use some malt, just a tad, to smooth it out.  Mouthfeel - Crisp and dry. Clean finish. Makes you thirsty for another swig.  Drinkability - Very drinkable. Not super heavy like a lot of winterbrews. Stronger than a regular SNIPA, but nothing over the top.  Overall - This is a better version of a Siera Nevada IPA, more balanced than a straight IPA, a little richer. For a ""winter"" brew, a little light. Could use some darker color and a thicker taste.

Moderate carbonation with a rich, creamy texture. Medium body. Not bad at all. Goes down easy. I'll try it again next time I run into it on tap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SkeeterHawk,3.92,"Though I don't believe that the years of this beer should be lumped together, I will deal with it. This is for the 2005 edition...  Appearance: Pours a super clear reddish amber color with only a 1/4"" head at first pour. There were a few bubbles rising at the beginning, but they failed to maintain the head. The head was gone within a minute. There was a tad of lacing left after drinking the beer.  Aroma: Citrusy and piney hops are the most noticeable part of the aroma profile. I get very little caramel malt as the beer is cold. As the beer warms, I don't really notice ay major change in the aroma pofile...it just stays hoppy.  Taste: The taste is really bitter and has a bold hop presence. There is a bunch of pine and citrus noticeable at first. The citrus isn't as light as just grapefruit or lemons, but is really rich with the impression of limes and other darker citrus fruits. It's not too often that you get this combination of flavor. The finish is definitely balanced toward the bitter, and finishes with a tad of alcoholic warming. It is a bit under carbonated, so the hops seem to linger as an oily mess on your palate, so I am not too impressed with the mouthfeel.  Opinion: Well, amazingly enough from my review, I think that this is one of the better years for Celebration in at least the past 3-4 years. It is hard to review them as a vertical tasting as the hops mellow as it ages. This one is probably the most balanced of all that I have tried thus far...out of the box. Contrary to many others, this is not my favorite beer. I am amused by it though, so I have to keep trying it. I normally put some back too, so I can try it later. I believe that this beer is really in its prime at least 4-6 months after its release. I would recommend this beer, but mostly for the fact that it is an icon in the micro-brew community.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,unknownlamer,4,"2005  Poured a clear copper with an off white head. The smell is mostly intense cascade hops. It reminds me of an amped up SNPA. The taste is similar with a good malt taste up front followed by the strong hops. It tastes to me like an SNPA with a lot more cascade and a bit of chinook (I guess? Every IPA I've had with a gristly taste in the finish had them in it) thrown in to roughen the finish.  The carbonation is just right, and the hops aren't overly bitter but are rather nice and floral. They don't crush the pallete, and the hop taste lingers for a very long time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ejames,4.44,"This is my first review, so please be gentle  2005 edition  Appearance: Pours a dark copper clear, nothing outstanding.  Smell: Pure hops  Taste: This is a phenomenal beer. I savor this beer every year. Hops hit you up front; a simple malt characteristic comes through at the very end. Hops linger, they would be much for a non-hop head. There is no beating around the pine tree, this is one hopped up beer  Mouth feel: Very smooth. Not too much carbonation, just enough to feel, but allows enough for multiple bottles to be consumed.  Drinkability: Be careful with this one. It is strong, but the hops, taste, mouth feel will deceive you. Pay attention to this beer as it only comes along once a year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SaCkErZ9,4.55,"This is by far my favorite winter seasonal beer. Pours a perfect copper color with crystal clear clarity and a very nice 1.5 finger sized hed that leaves a copious amount of lacing down the side of my pint glass.  Smell is terrific. Large amounts of citrusy and piney hops with grapefruit in the aroma as well. Caramel malts.  Taste is all hops. Very smooth. Hop bitterness is pretty strong and creates a bit of astringency. Almost makes me pucker, but in a good way.  A bit astringent at times but great drinkability. Definitely one to keep around all winter to add that warming feeling and keep the cold bite out of the body.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ElGordo,4.25,"As the 727th reviewer of this beer, I'm sure I'm adding a tremendous level of not-yet-seen insight here. Pours a bright, translucent amber hue topped by a nice-looking inch or so if creamy white head. Pleasing aroma of crisp, spicy hops, tempered by some caramel malt and the lingering essence of black pepper. Hop flavor is sharp and assertive up front, mellowed only slightly by some caramel malt. Notes of pine, black pepper, grapefruit, and some astringency come through. Body is rich and creamy, belying the character of most American IPAs. If not for the alcohol, this would be infinitely drinkable (further enabled by the 32oz cups for $5 at Satisfaction's last night).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HugoGrim,4.32,"Deep amber color with a substantial two finger head.  Scent was spicy and fruity, with a full body of flowery hops.  Flavor is in your face spice and hops. Lived up to the hype. Where can I even begin with the list of flavors that assault the pallet? Hops, nuts, whole grain breads, something vaguely cinnamon like, malty caramel the list goes on. Needless to say a very complex flavor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,warriorsoul,4.01,"I'm baaack!! I was not overly impressed with last years offering, so I am back for more (do not cue Ratt!) Pours a bright copper color with two full fingers of beige head after a fairly aggressive pour...sticks around for quite a while and produces some attractive, web-like lacing. Nice balance of sweet malt and citrus hops in the nose. There is that hop profile I was beggin' for...huge piney hops up front but the malt backbone really helps to balance it out and not be over the top. Bitterness lingers a bit, but in a good way...the carbonation is nice for the style and the mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Very easy drinking here...a true session brew, especially fresh. I am real glad I picked this one up again...a solid brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,andjusticeforale,3.58,"Special Celebration Ale 2005 edition short stubby  This is a great looking beer, aggressively poured into a large pint glass, which left a nice white to off white head of moderate to good retention.  The immediate smell is strong grapefruit tinged hops, stronger than any IPA Ive opened lately. Really quite unbelievable. My first thought was over the hop or hopnoxious.  The taste was sadly unbalanced in favor of hop aroma and bittering. This had a malty underbelly,. But the domination was hops. The finish was dry and bitter and left an astringent zip high on the palate.  Dont get me wrong, if you like Stone Arrogant Bastard, or any of the hopped up 4000 minute IPAs, you will dig this. But a celebration ale in the old world style ? Jesus Jones- only if the old world is Portland Oregon!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ReebShorts,4.57,"Pours a brownish orange color, poured into a Orval Chalice, decent head faded rather quickly leaving some islands and lace all around the edge.  Quite a bit to smell here, a pleasant, yet complex mix of sweet malt caramel, spicy floral hopps, pine, citrus, etc.. like I said there is a lot going on here.  Very good, I had anticipated this would be somewhat sweet, but was actually more bitter, and had a nice, clean hop finish. Drinkability must be great as I'm already bummed that I only have 3 of these in my possesion this evening.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BigRedN,4.47,"2005 Edition.  Appearance: Poured from the 12 oz stubby bottle into my pint glass a coppery color. Somewhat thin 1/4 white head forms then fades to a cloud and ring around the glass. Some lacing, not really sheets but some stringers and splotches.  Smell: The smell of this beer is as good as previous editions I have had. Burst of fresh hops on the nose. Predominately piney, a little earthy and herbal scents mixed in for good measure. Well hopped.  Taste: I brace myself for the blast of hops. There is a definite bitterness brought on by the hops, but also a subtle bready malt backing to hold this one in balance. The finish is like drinking a forest. Pine lingers at the back of my throat.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, light carbonations. Lively bitter hops. This beer also hides its higher alcohol content (6.8% according to the bottle) very well, alcohol is not present.  Drinkability: Another fine year for Celebration. Nicely hopped, seeems similar to previous years, except this year I was not as impressed by the appearance. Still, a very drinkable beer and a 6-pack is a must buy every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Hunter,3.13,"Appearance: Hard pour yields a thick head of dense bubbles atop a light amber brew with brisk carbonation. Good head retention, some lacing.  Aroma: As hoppy as SN Pale Ale. Malt is in there somewhere, but it definitely takes a back seat to the grassy hop overtones. Not bad, if hops are your thing. Taste: I admit, I have no idea how this tastes any different than their pale ale. Maybe they just upped the ABV? Sharp notes of hops, citrus, and pepper, with an almost too-sharp hop bite in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Light and bracing.  Drinkability: Certainly no less drinkable than their Pale, but points are lost for lack of originality.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

This brew pours a nice copper color with a beautiful fluffy white head leaving substantial lacing in my glass. Nose is citrusy and slightly malty. Taste is a wonderful blend of malts and hops, reminds me a bit of the ESB style of beer as opposed to a winter seasonal. Mouthfeel is good as this is extremely lively on the palate and adequately full. Overall drinkability is very good.

140,1904,HogHill,4.12,"Pours a copper color with an off-white two finger creamy head in a Harpoon IPA pint glass.  A very juicy hop aroma, no doubt this one is brewed with high alpha acid hops.  Flavor is primarily a big grapefruit juiciness from the hops, and a bitter crisp finish. I think it nicely balanced though, doesn't quite go into the double IPA range. Feels medium bodied.  I always make sure to pick up a few six packs of Celebration each winter. The fact that it is seasonal makes it bit more special even though it's not so hard to find.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Domingo,4.12,"Wow. Not what I expected at all! Ordered at Old Chicago as ""the beer or the month."" The bottle implied it was a winter seasonal...so I expected a spicy brown ale or something similar. Not the case AT ALL! As it turns out, this is a kick ass IPA. Color is a reddish brown mahogany. While expecting a sour sweetness and spice, the immdiate smell that hits you when you take a whiff is nothing but pure hops! Reminds me a little of Hop Devil or DFH's 90. Flavor is hops with a little malty sweetness in the finish. Again, not what I expected, but a great experience. Mouthfeel is solid. Just the right amout of carbonation and ""thickness."" Has a little bit of an alcohol kick (I was following up a 3-4% brew with this, so it was exaggerated to me) but not too extreme. A great IPA. Not sure what the availability on this is as it's a seasonal, but it's up there with Stone, Victory, and DFH as far as IPA's go. Great beer!  2006 Edit: Now that I knew what to expect, this brew wasn't quick such a sudden surprise...but I like it even more. This is really an EXCELLENT beer and one I wish was year-round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,arguemaniac,4.23,"Pours a deep, orange-amber color with a frothy orange-tinged white head. Massive citrus hop aroma. While the palate is also dominated by hops, its a little more complex and includes not only citrus (grapefruit, to be exact) hop flavor, but to a lesser extent pine and floral hops as well. There is some very mild caramel and grain too, but those sweet, malty flavors are pretty much eclipsed by the robust hop profile. Mouthfeel is smooth with very active carbonation.  While IPAs are, in my opinion, inherently unbalanced, that would be my only complaint about this beer. Otherwise, its outstanding!

Taste is very enjoyable; hops dominate with notes of smooth malt, floral elements, and some controlled citrus character. Very nice.

Hops are right there on the tip of your tongue tasting as citrusy as ever. Slightly toasted and a bit caramelly (at least more so than the standard IPA). Nice amber with very foamy white head. If poured well, the head will stand like sea foam and last the entire time.  Also, I found a 2002 version of this beer in my basement. The biggest difference is a pronounced caramel malt flavor.

A somewhat atypical holiday brew in that it doesn't feature any spices, herbs, or other unusual ingredients; this one lets the hops do all the talking. A big, woody, pine-tinged hop nose gives way to an explosion of classic american hop character typified by citrus/grapefruit essences; and it's all backed up by a sturdy malt backbone. It's an absolute must-have for any lover of american hops and what they can do in a beer.

As such, hops is th name of the game with this one, it pours a dark orange with a red tint and a noticable chill haze. I think all beer that can tansmit light throught them should have a chill haze, it makes them look more tasty. At first I didn't even notice the hops but on the second sip it was obvious, not overly but quite present and very distinct. It's very complex with a heavy hopping that isn't too heavy and the hops are quite delecate. You can even smell the hops before you take a sip which tells you you're in for something interesting.

140,1904,ChiSox05,4.28,"Served on-tap @ the MGM poker room in Las Vegas, oh what a treat.  An off-white head with traces of bronze 3/4"" thick. Color has oranges, browns and garnet red. At first looked like bourbon with the head of a beer or dark iced tea, but upon closer inspection colors become more complex between ambers and reds. Looks clear, clean and very appetizing. Clinging lace draped around the pint glass after every sip.  Hop aroma is #1 with some a sweet caramel malt background. Hops are orange citrus, grapefruit, faint green apple and maybe slight tropical or peach scents.  Flavor is fruity and hoopy. Begins with the citric fruity hop flavor and a noticeable hop bitterness that is well balanced by a helping of sweet malt, warm alcohol and faint pine. Aftertaste is slightly metallic then turns to a long lasting taste of roasty malt while acidic, fruity hops remain present.  Carbonation remained active in each pint, coming out after held in the mouth. While easy to sip and mostly smooth, I was aware I was drinking it each sip (if that makes any sense). Alcohol is noticeable but not at all offensive, in fact blends well with the malt and hops. Has an aftertaste and leaves bright, tingling feeling on palate.  Drinkability is nearly perfect, my favorite winter offering. If you can get to LV, go to the MGM, sit in the poker room or sports book and try not to lose your ass while knocking these back.

Definate grapefruit citrus brightness with citrus aftertaste. This is not at all what I expect from a holiday seasonal brew...expecting something more in the vein of a bock, red, porter, or stout, however it is a very refreshing change for the season. the higher alcohol is definately warming on a winters day without sacrificing the thirstquenching dry brightness you might be accostomed to from your summer brews.

It's a hop-lover's paradise, from the moment it's aroma flows to your nose until the last drop is swallowed. While the hops are pronounced and intense, they are not overly dominating which provides a nice counter-balance to the maltiness from the high alc %.

M: Satiating moutfeel, a little creamy and a little oily, but not too heavy of a body.  D: I could drink this until the alcohol put me down, but I can see how it might not be something everyone could continue to down.  Overall: Definitely one for the hop heads.

140,1904,cooter,4.35,"A powerful, regal appearance. Slowly drifting bubbles, a silken head that affords no compromise as I let it sit for twenty minutes untouched...it must have the blood of kings.  Smells surprisingly good. I have low expectations of winter warmers and celebration ales, and I'll say now that i don't see Sierra N. brand as a top runner...but this has promise. Wicked awesome promise.  Anyway, smells of delicious, rich and fruitily fragrant hops, smooth and abundant. Also clove, I want to say peppermint, bark, pine, and by the gods I smell olive oil. Some nuts.  First taste uses the head so well it's like Jenna Jameson. Creamy and hoppy but not even a tinge of bitter, despite grapefruit, pepper, more pine, sticky maple, mango, melon, and a host of other hopitudes being present, PLUS the fantastic malt roastiness towards the back. Strawberry jumps in at the front and fades instantly to nothing. Reminds me of 60 minute IPA from Dogfish Head, mutated into a half-porter style.  Mouthfeel, do I even need to spell it out? Superb. Creamy beyond belief, smooth, but with enough bite to keep you wildly excited.  For balance and fairness and to show I'm not biased, this beer isn't drinkable at all. To have a second would be a chore. It's too rich, too spicy, too thick and flavorful on the tongue and on the roof of the mouth.

This beer smells like wet hops and plastic. Sorry guys, just my opinion. Upon another inhalation, it has a spicy citrus smell which is quite nice once you get passed the plastic.  This ale is strangely creamy and, as anticipated, very hoppy. I dont personally have a soft spot for hoppy beers, so this one doesnt stand out as one of my favorites. It has lots of things going on though. This beer reminds me of grapefruit and lemon peel. Bitter and spicy makes for a great winter warmer. That ABV might catch you off guard, watch out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Bitterbill,4.45,"Poured from the bottle(room temp) with a nice head that dissipated fairly slowly into a fine broken layer in the center and a fine lacing around the edge of glass. The colour is a very attractive and clear reddish gold.  The smell is a strong hoppy-fruity aroma that is very inviting, no compelling.  The taste is very strong hops with grapefruit notes that jumps at you early then settles down a bit in the middle with some malt tones and returns with a very nice bitterness in the aftertaste. Wow! This is one of my favourite brews of *any* style!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,pjwilson,4.22,"ok lets add another. yeah this beer is darn good, i'm sorta glad it's seasonal though. appearance: it's amber, which seems fine in this case. smell: ah. hops. but very, very fresh hops. almost like wet hops or draft beer. i'm guessing this is the dry hopping. the smell is so strong it mixes with the taste while you drink it. taste: it's got a very prickly bitterness, that is not smooth at all. yet it works well in this case. the malts are up to the task of keeping this thing balanced. there's just something a little different from other ipa's that i can't put my finger on. but this is bitter enought to scare non-hopheads away. mouthfeel is quite carbinated. drinkability is super high for a beer this complex. I've drank a pint of this with ease. for this review i've turned it into a nice siper in a tulip and that works too. enjoy",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Lnedrive14,4.18,"Bottle of 2005  A: Like an organic, 100% juice apple juice. Single finger pearl colored head. Unbelievable lacking - 5 minutes later it is still coating my dogfish head pint glass (thanks nick).  S: I dont know - nothing special here. Spicy and citrusy - exactly what i expect from an IPA.  T: Quite interesting. The hops knocked me aside initially, but as I continued drinking I realized they arent overwhelming at all. They hit you upon first sip, but dissipate quickly without any bitter remainder. Definite orange and grapefruit.  M: I doubt this adjective is appropriate for an IPA, but it was creamy! Slid down easy and coated my throat the whole way. Truly great feel.  D: I think I could pretty much pound these away. Doesn't have the raw power of the Stone IPA, but at the same time, it might make it easier to drink. Great brew to enjoy a six-pack of over the course of a day of football.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,waldowin,4.16,"From the 2005 run.  Pours a nice clear amber, with a thick, sticky white head, that just pastes itself against the sides of the glass in layers.  Smells of a pine forest, and citrus and cedar. Has a nice pop to it.  Tastes a hint of medium malt, very simple, and followed by a nice pop of pine and cedar. Wonderful hop kick at the end that just offsets the malt. Almost a bit of toasted walnuts in the finish. Mildly spicy, with a nice tinge.  The carbonation adds another edge to the hops, and makes it a pleasurable grapefruit fizz along your tongue.  This is good stuff! I don't really care for their pale at all, but this is fantastic stuff. Wish it was made year-round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,wedge,4.33,"2005  Pours a clear reddish copper hue with steady carbonation. A fat creamy off-white head floats on top - good retention. Nice fresh hop aroma with a hint of spiciness. The flavor is of crisp, resinous hops that shroud a light acidic grapefruit middle - the malts work well with the hops, they're there but they balance out the hop-load without interfering. Very fresh. Medium body, lingering dry bitterness.  Juicy. I guess its the light spicy quality that makes this seasonal. At 6.8% a few of these will warm you up real good. Definately well worth sampling on tap as well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,slyke,4.28,"This was a great beer to have this afternoon - gloomy and misty in my neighborhood.  This beer poured a pleasing copper-rust color with an off-white head.  The aroma was very malty with some hop notes.  Taste was great with a hoppy bite up front, malt dominated the middle of the taste, then back to the hops for a nice dry finish.  Mouthfeel is great too. Just what you'd expect in a wintery IPA.  Drinkability is good on this beer. It is just the kind of thing for a cold and wet day. A couple of these is a nice way to pass a couple of hours.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,santoslhalper,4.33,"2005 Edition  Appearence: Pours a mostly clear copper with a bubbly, frothy off-white head that lingers forever and leaves nice lacing. Loads of fast moving carbonation.  Smell: Nice fruity and floral hops hit the nose with a nice bready background.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Hot diggity damn this is one hell of an IPA. Strong, in-your-face abrasive hops, with killer spices, yet still delicately balanced. This is very alive tasting, very vibrant if you will, and is a real treat for the taste buds. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth.  Drinkability and Overall: Hell yeah. Go Sierra Nevada. I wasn't a big fan of last years version, but this one is phenomenal. A very good winter IPA, and one I'd like to see what age does to. This one's a winner.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,buckiflyer,4.62,"2005 edition: Purchased a single at Whole Foods in Raleigh. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Smell: All hops. Color: clear amber with large long lasting white head. Very hoppy taste with a smooth finish. I really like this beer. I was expecting a winter spice malty beer, but was surprised and very happy. Did not realize this was an IPA. A great beer, worth picking up a six pack.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cracgor,4.11,"Perfect looking beer. Nice clear amber body with a tall offwhite head that lasts and lasts. Smells sweet and fruity with a kick of hops. Has a bit more christmas/winter smell to it than I expected from a style created to send beer to some of the hottest and most humid regions of the earth prior to refrigeration. Wow to the taste! It is a very fruity and well malted IPA. I'd like to see more hops, but what it does have makes the beer taste more like I expect in cold weather. Light to medium body. Dry and Crisp. I may have to go get a case of this stuff:-)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SupaCelt,3.97,"I hadn't had this since 2002. From what I remebered, it was pretty darn good. I figured I would get in the holiday spirit and pick up a sixer to see what was shaking with this year's edition.  Looks: Clear and clean as expected. Amber in colour with copious helpings of plump fizzles. I got about a half inch of head from a less than vigorous pour. This beige cap recedes to a surface coat and leaves tracks of lace in its wake.  Smells: Nicely hopped. Pine aromas and scents of fruitiness are notable, with a vague breadiness underneath. I could say grapefruit and feel relatively comfortable with that description. This is not a super pungent strain of ale, but it is quite pleasant to sniff.  Tastes: Nicely hopped as well. Resinous sappy tones and the aforementioned grapefruit which emerges in the bitter finish. The malt character is overshadowed as expected. It has just a hint of sweetness and crustiness. Hops are the headline. There is quite a pronounced drying effect in the finish and a fruity aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: This is not a monster by any means, with a medium body at best. It is what it claims to be. Nothing fancy here just a good old IPA American style.  Drinkability: Easily dispatched with. This could be in the SN year round lineup. Then they could come out with something a bit more over the top for celebration season. At any rate this is a fine beer. As long as one realizes what this is and doesn't expect a mind blowing special production just because it says celebration, it's pretty good. This is not something that I will count down the days until next release though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,troutmask96,4.75,"I've never been a big fan of mass-produced IPA's, but after reading glowing reviews of Sierra Nevada's seasonal Celebration Ale, I sprung for a sixer. Pours a thick, foamy head that moved up my flute glass quickly. Smell is very fruity, which I found rather unique for an IPA. Taste is...oh, I guess so-so, but nothing that struck me as exceptional. Mouthfeel is decent, but a bit watery, not as thick as some of my favorite IPA's. A very high level of carbonation has me downgrading the drinkability due to the belchiness that comes with session drinking of this brew.  I did like the fruitiness, though. It reminded me a bit of Southern Comfort. So there you have it: SN's Celebration Ale is the Southern Comfort of beers...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,blackie,3.63,"appearance: The pour creates a .5"" white head in the snifter. A layer of foam is left on top. Nice lacing. The beer is a light copper in color. 2005 edition.  smell: Nice level of piney hops here. Big aromas of tropical fruits (mango, citrus...), which I enjoy thoroughly. The hops are at the forefront, but there is some malt characteristic coming through.  mouthfeel: Carbonation is slightly above medium, and the body a moderate thin.  taste: Decent balance here, imo. A little more malt coming through would be nice. Some nondescript dark and light fruit flavors. Dominant bitterness from the hops, with a little malt flavor taking second stage. More malt, more hop flavor, more complexity, please.  drinkability: just a couple is plenty  I've seen some other reviews complaining about a lack of balance. Though I would like a little more malty sweetness, there is plenty here to keep me satisfied. It is an IPA, after all.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bigdeuce,4.05,"Another beauty from Sierra Nevada. Only drawback is it should be a year round brew not winter. It's a definite IPA with smooth initial contact and beautiful hoppy washdown. Also has some characteristics of an ESB but definitely more bitter. Great tracing down the glass, smooth spicy start, hoppy bitter finish.  I try to rate the beer not by what a beer company ""says"" it is as I do more the style it really is, and this one is no winter brew but an excellent APA/IPA(whichever you choose).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,WTexas,3.3,"The 2005 Celebration Ale appeared a light amber color with a promising thick beige head of foam. It smelled exceptionally hoppy  not surprising given its IPA heritage. I anticipated a complex mixing of flavors, but found only an almost brackish bitterness which was consistent throughout the session. I did not detect the spiced accents that Ive come to expect in other holiday beers. I only found a resin and pine aftertaste. Mouthfeel was also disappointing -- oily and thin are the words that best capture it for me. Sierra Nevadas 2005 offering is an adequate IPA, but not one that Ill be using to ring in the holidays.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Stimack,4.34,"After last year really only being able to find this brew on tap, it seems to be all over the place in bottles this year. This review is for the 2005 Bottle version. Brew pours to a amber color with a small off white head that has pretty good retention and leaves a lot of lacing through out. The aroma is hoppy in character to say the least with pine like scents dominating followed by a caramel malt flavor. I think the hops really seem to make distinguishing some of the spices quite hard. The taste is nice, starts real smooth, and then quickly breaks to a strong hop flavor of pine that stays in the mouth for quite a while. Again, this is a very smooth tasting brew, one that I must say makes my day when it is available. A favorite.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,indy169,4.5,"I sampled this beer at a local watering hole and was floored by it. I was expecting a decent fruity/hoppy/spicy beer and was shocked to find all that plus some real conviction. The flavors really are alive and pronounced. light fruit and spice essence hinting at kiwi, pear and ginger, mixing perfectly with a killer bold hopping. Sierra Nevada has got a real winner here. My hat is off to you folks at SN. This is one beer worthy of joining your celebration. Happy Holidays",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bunn4funn,3.54,"Reveiwed from a bottle 2005  Apearence- Beautiful caramel, clear color with a nice pancake colored one finger head. Great lacing effect from this bottle i mean incredable.  Aroma- Well its definatly hoppy/piney with a short following of caramel and baking spices like nutmeg, even some grapefuit/lemon  Taste- sharp bite from the hops upfront. They are piny and leave a definate ""spike"" in the tounge. Im getting that lemon bready feel from this brew as it warms. Now that it has matured (out of the bottle) and my palete is more accoustomed to the hops i can tell that there is a whole other side. Like some caramel and baking spices. Just what you would expect a celebration ale from Sierra Nevada to taste like.  Mouthfeel- Smooth and lightly carbonated, slightly oily.  Drinkability- Good even though it is 6.8% abv, Though you might want to pace yourself it will creep up on you after two or three. Its just so good i dont want to stop drinking it!!1  Overall- Fine brew, love what it has to offer!!! Great to drink with family and friends.

140,1904,charlatan,3.79,"Copper colour with a decent head which dissipates quickly. This smells wonderful. One can detect piney, herbal hops and sweet malt. Before it warms it smells a little metallic.  Well integrated flavour with a surprisingly citric bent. This is a little oily on the tongue but with good carbonation and a definite lemon rind flavour with a pleasant herbal aftertaste. The alcohol is rather more apparent than I would like, but that does little to detract from this winner.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Aroma: Not as impressed with the nose as I would have liked.It was hops,piney,and slightly skunky.  Taste: The tongue discovers this beer to be hops in the start,malts on the sides, and slightly bitter in the finish.Not much alcohol detected,but it is present.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is thin,fizzy on the togue,with lots of small bubbles throughout the entire mouth.  Drinkability: This beer is definitely a good christmas session brew.I know I could drink a few of these easily, but I will say it is a good thing this one is a seasonal.  -Cheers2Beers",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Mark,4.43,"Wow! I have never paid much attention to this brew but now I'm regretting it. The 2005 offering is a knockout. A very clear amber body was topped by a white head that left nice rings of lacing. Slightly piney aroma did not prepare me for the piney, grapefruity blast of hops that assaulted me in a wonderful way. Refreshing and drinkable. Sierra Nevada, my apologies for always considering you a mainstream, pedestrian craft brewer, when in actuality you are along with Anchor one of the pioneers. Great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,LPorter33,4.77,"I'd heard great things about this beer and missed it last year. The 2005 batch was on sale at Martignetti's (6 packs for $5.99) so I picked up a couple.  Appearance = Clear, crisp looking light, honey amber colored. 1/2'' head which faded quickly, leaves a nice thin line with respectable lacing.  Smell = A Fresh hop blast. Pine and citrus smells seem to share equal weight. There's a ton of flavor here.  Taste = Wow! What an exceptional IPA. So friggan fresh and clean tasting and bursting with hops flavor. The hops are not astringent nor completely overpowering and a thin malt presence backs up the flavor creating an amazing tasting experience. Mouthfeel is soothing and soft, not harsh in the least. I can't get over how drinkable this is, yet still powerful and full of flavor. The 6.8% will hit you but you'd never believe it based on the taste.  Overall = This might very well be the best IPA I've ever tasted. It should be brewed 365 and knowing it won't last, I'll be buying a ton of it this season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,burnstar,4.75,"This beer is a dark amber with a thick off-white head which leaves lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is all fantastic hops- spicy and citrusy. There are also some sweet and fruit notes in the background. The taste is also dominated by the hops. Again spicy and citrusy. Also some pine notes. There is also quite a bit of delicious sweet and caramel malt lurking in the background- which the pletiful hop easily keeps in check. Really just fantastic tasting stuff. Lots of nuances come together to really make this taste like the holidays without being at all gimicky. It really manages to have huge hop and malt flavor and still be very subtle. Mouthfeel is great- medium to full bodied, smooth and creamy. Definitely very drinkable. I don't find this at all cloying which I find can be a problem with other holiday beers' drinkability. I reallly love this stuff. I think it will definitely become a holiday tradition for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mrasskicktastic,4.03,"A - A gorgous amber with a monster frothy head. Lacing clings all over the glass. The lacing's disregard for gravity is uncanny. This is one hell of a pretty beer.  S - Pine and citrus hops with a slight malt and floral character - crisp, clean and clear.  T - Pine hops dominate but the citrus ones are well meshed. Very elaborate. Slightly malty with a nice bitter finish.  M - Smooth, refreshing, nothing special, nothing bad.  D - Outstanding. This goes down well. ABV is deceptively high. The hops completely mask it. 6.8 is higher than I ever would have expected from this delightful brew. Works fabulously as a session beer. Very good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jakester,4.23,"I got this as a gift from my dad. I drank it in a goblet. This is the 2005 model.  Pours a slightly hazy orange with red tints. A nice thick head of cream colored foam forms on top, which eventually falls to a good coating and a ring. Very good lacing sticks to the glass.  Aroma is herbal/piney hops, not overly done, and rich, clean caramely malt. A wee bit of spicy hop smell is there, also. Smells are somewhat muted, but very clean and pleasant.  First flavor is hop bitterness, but not too much. Then, big, clean caramel malt comes through, followed by herbal pine hops. Residual sweetness is minimal. Aftertaste is a pleasant bitterness and caramel malt. This beer is delicious!  Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, with medium carbonation across the tongue. Medium bodied, with a decent grab at the back of my throat from hop bitterness. Finish is semi-sweet and bitter.  As winter seasonals go, this is one of the best. It's slightly different every year, which makes for some intriguing tasting debates, but it's always good. Highly recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BrewRunner,3.71,"Pours a light amber color with a nice white head. Looks nice in a glass.  Aroma is kind of disappointing. I couldn't really smell anything. That's better than having a bad smell, but there's nothing better than a strong aroma.  It's pretty bitter in taste, but not overwhelming. For some reason pine needles come to mind. But that could just be some odd mental thing I have from growing up among the conifers.  It is easily drinkable, with my 6 pack disappearing pretty quickly.  Overall, it's a very good beer, worth trying and I can't wait until they come out again next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Sephiroth,3.68,"No date on the bottle, but this is fresh, from 05. Pours with decent head, the body is a burnt orange color. The smell is of grassy, piney hops with barely a hint of caramel malt.  The taste is west coast hoppy. Dry, piney, bitter hops with slight grassiness. Slight caramel malt profile. Mouthfeel is leaning toward the heavy side for an IPA. This is a good beer, but it's not one of my favorites.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,neonbrown82,4.62,"I've been waiting all year for this to come out since I didn't get around to reviewing it last year (and because it's really fucking good).  Pours to a dark amber color with minimal carbonation but a nice thick white head with a decent lacing. Yada yada yada, on to more important things...  This beer smells and tastes great! It's the next best thing to taking your cascade hops intraveinously. Very fruity and piney with a nice spiciness. Also a bit more of a full malt character than their Pale Ale.  I was so glad to see this on the shelves at work that I had to take home a case. Hopefully this will last past my birthday in a week, but the drinkability of this beer may prove me wrong.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ommegangpbr,4,"Take their pale ale, turn up the volume (with some tinkering with the equalizer) and you have this concoction. I like this better than their pale ale because the use of hops here seems appropriate to me, with less of that discordant bitter twang than I find in some of the Sierra Nevada brews. A big, strong IPA for the winter season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kbnooshay,3.75,had this at MacGregors on tap (20 oz). This was a nice clear amber brown with a small head. The smell was very hoppy and piney. The taste is malty sweet but the hops dominate. Nicely bitter. Moderate mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. For some reason i found this less drinkable than other strong IPA's but it is very enjoyable to have 1 or 2.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tempest,4.11,"Picked up a growler from Finger Lakes Beverage on a saturday trip to Ithaca.  Looks pretty damn good. Pours a dark amber with great head and lacing.  Stong smell, very similar to taste. A strong, but well-rounded hops aroma. A little citrusy.  Tastes pretty good, but could use a little balance in my opinion. While the hops did taste great, the beer lacked complexity.  Nice in your mouth, but overall, a little tough to drink (especially and entire growler). Recommended for any hop head.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ChrisA,4.2,"Good copper color. Poured a two inch head with nice lacing. Heavy hop aromas and flavor up front. Very strong hop taste throughout with not much malt balance.

I may have had a bad one mixed into my six pack.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,stodbrew,4.6,"2005 Edition.  Pours a very slighty hazy deep copper, borderline red, color. Nice white head that lasts and lasts.  Aroma is all hops. Piney, citrusy, and a bit grapefruity.  Flavor is more hops. Grapefruit again, and some hop spiciness. All balanced with a very nice malt backbone.  Mouthfeel is full and round. Perfect carbonation.  This is a phenomenal beer. I look forward to this beer every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,akahn,4.13,"2005 batch, no date marked.  Pours a deep amber reddish hue, clear. A thick, creamy tan head that leaves ringlets of lace. In all a very good looking beer.  Smells of spices and fresh, citrusy hops, a bit of caramel sweetness in the nose too, maybe maple.  Moderate carbonation and a medium, smooth body. Very smooth, almost buttery. Earthy hop flavors. Slightly nutty, sweet malt flavor. Dry, spicy and floral in the finish, with alcohol showing up. The hops clearly dominate, with malt providing complimentary undertones.  Conclusion: This is one delicious beer. This is not as bitter as I remember it from last year. Very good again, though, and drinkable. Recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,joedon,4.3,"Really excellent pale ale. A lot like their ""Pale Ale"" only better. Nice copper color and long lasting pale tan head. Nose has strong hop and malt aroma.  Perfectly balanced taste with lots of hops and malt as well as a little caramel-toffee flavor.  Very enoyable beer, easy to drink. Only had it from the bottle, never on tap. Not sure it is even available outside California from the keg.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,LarryV,3.85,"2005 bottle. Poured a deep golden amber color with a minimal head. I expected to be greeted with the usual piney SN hop aroma, but damn, there's hardly any aroma at all. I buried my nose in the glass, but I still could not pick up much of anything other than a bit of maltiness. Hops are very present in the taste profile, but not much of anything else going on. Leaves a pleasant hop bitterness lingering on the palate, but overall, it doesn't seem very balanced.  To me, it just doesn't seem as robust as in previous years. Still a good beer, but not delicious. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. I don't think this years is up to par with previous years, somewhat underwhelming.  11/16/2005 - My palate/nose must have been off when I commented about the beer not being as good as previous years.

Citrus rind, herbs and floral hop flavors are assertive and very appetizing.  HOPS!!! Beautiful hops! Resinous and herbal with touches of pine tar and citrus rind. Good toasted malt could be a little stronger, but is appropriate. Some sweet juicy hop flavor.  Moderate to light body and active but not frothy carbonation.

I remember trying this beer for the first time last year and not expecting an IPA but I was pleasantly surprised. If one wants to know what a ""floral hop aroma"" is like then dip your nose into Celebration, god does love us. Hazy copper-orange color, appetizing head, and those great hops are up front on the nose. Upon your first sip you notice the great medium body mouthfeel and a dried grape fruit, orange marmalade taste. Long, long dry finish....man I need another sip.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Luigi,4.7,Pours a rich amber color with a mild haziness. Large creamy white head. Sticks all over the glass with no end in sight. Love it! The aroma is rich in floral and piney hops. The flavor is a dream for hopheads. Has a nice sharpness on the tongue. Citrus and pine hop flavor dominate. There is a small amount of malts pull though. Has a semi-dry hoppy aftertaste.

140,1904,orsulacp,3.44,"2005 Vintage I poured this beer vigorously to get a huge egg-shell white head, with a clear light amber body. The smell is dominated by the hops, mostly piney some fruit, with a hint of nutmeg. The hops also dominate the taste, which is a good thing. I don't get much else in the taste. The malt is hidden by the hops, not getting much from the malts It has a medium body and leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. I would like to have a little bit more malt to balance the great tasting hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ghostwalker,4.3,"2005 edition.  Reddish amber pour with high frothy white head. Nice lacing.  Sharp citrus nose, grapefruit.  Piney, citrus bite up front. More hops on the finish. In between, hops. This is absolutely not what I expected from a winter seasonal, but I like it! Some spice flavors hidden in there too, but hard for me to pick out from the hops. I guess I agree with the black pepper mention from other reviews, but the glory that is Cascade hops is the star here.  Mouthfeel is typical of a good IPA. Crisp, sharp, highly carbonated and tasty.  Drinkability is great! I will be getting a couple of more 6 packs for a birthday party this weekend, cause I know it will be a hit. Or, if not, I won't mind drinking them all myself.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,sacfly,4.5,"2005 version Pours a deep amber color with a thick tan head of large bubbles. Head dies down quickly, but maintains a thin layer.  Aroma is of sweet grapefruit. First sip rips at the tongue with a harsh astringent bitterness. But in a good way? For some reason the astringent character works here. Bitter, unsweetened grapefruit flavor wrapped in a medium bodied package.  At first the malt is undetectable but a hint of sweetness builds as I drink. Somewhat dry finish on the sides of the tongue, but the rest seems to be continually watering. Perhaps some Pavlovian response to hops Ive developed begging me to drink another. And drink another I shall. Cant argue with Biology/Psychology- at least if it tells me to drink more Celebration Ale! Better than the 2004 IMHO.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Bcant,4.38,"2005 vintage.  Gorgeous copper with exceptional clarity, toped by a white head made of tiny bubbles that leaves good lacing. The bouquet exhibits some light apple notes as well as delicate spice (nutmeg and coriander) and citrus, and gives only the smallest indication of the wonderful hop-bath your tong is about the take. When it comes to taste, the malt characters detectable in the nose are set aside and a strong American hop profile dominates, though some of the malts do come through briefly in the middle. The understated malts do not indicate a lack of warpath, you still get all the fireplace fuzziness you want from a winter seasonal.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Dithyramb,4.3,"2005 vintage, purchased as a six pack from Chesapeake Wine in Bmore. No discernable difference from previous years. You will receive a beautiful copper brew with a sticky off white head. Great carbonation, lacing, and retention. Big grapefruity piney aroma bouyed by a hefty caramel/bready malt body. The flavor will be full of Cascades, but expertly matched agains a caramel malt and slightly alcoholish background. You will want several. Though on the heavier side, this one will be enjoyed by non-beerknerds during holiday parties.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,hopsaplenty,4.22,"2005 release. The glowing copper body puts up an off-white head of bubbles of all sizes. Plenty of carbonation streams laze their way to the top, while the yeast sediment finds its way to the bottom. Big piney, grapefruit hop aromas along with some caramel and hints of bread crust. The signature SN Cascade hops wash over the tongue, followed by some warming malt sweetness with hints of alcohol, while balanced, this one and leans towards the hops. Highly drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,nortmand,4.97,"A vigorous pour produces a big, fluffy off whitish head atop a copper body.  Piney, resiny citrus aroma dominates. Some sweet malt in their somewhere.  Raisin, citrus, resin, so much going on in the front of the tongue. Ends at the back of the tongue with a bitter plumminess. Simply exquisite.  Full bodied, yet refreshing and very drinkable. Can't wait to get this by the mug at Crunchy's again this year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DaPeculierDane,4.5,"On tap at Wonder's Pub.  Nice amber with a fluffy white head. Good lacing.  Big western hops bring a hefty dose of juniper berries to the aroma. Citrusy. Herbal, maybe coriander and thyme. The cascade hop level isnt quite Mt. Ranier but it is a close Mt. Hood.  There is a decent amount of malt in here to balance the bitterness of the hops but hops still rule the day. Citrus floral notes dominate the flavor. Esters swish throughout, warming the brew. Also touches of nuttiness and grain.  Dry, crisp, and quite drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Litterbean,4,"Pours an amber orange, with a rising head that dissipates to a thin white cap. Some lace left behind.  Hoppy, leafy smell. Lots of citrus in the nose with an underlying sweetness.  The hops are prevalent in the taste as well, with a very earthy abundance of flavorings. There are sweet fruity notes as well, with grapefruit being the most obvious. Carbonation is biting and prevalent. Easy to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JasonCoop,4.8,"poured into a regular pint glass. pours a good dark amber color with a nice white head. lace stays throughout.  very aromatic, hops jump from the top of the glass. a little piney, a little spicy. good smell  taste is great. agressive hops right up front, really from beginning to end. a little alcoholish. somewhat of a spiced taste. quite a bite. not balanced in that the hops dominate here, but i love hops and i'm not complaining. a great warming winter brew.  the best thing about this winter brew is that they dont add too many holiday style spices or additives and it tastes like a more genuine ale.  mouthfeel is somewhat full. hops dry it out in the end. really nice. very tastey and very drinkable. I really like how the sierra brews tend to have generous hops tastes. this is one of my favorites. i wish i could get it year round. one of the best IPAs i've sampled yet, and consistently good year to year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,silver0rlead,4.23,"Pours a beautiful deep copper color with a huge, frothy beige head that leaves sticky lacing all down the glass. The aroma is very hoppy, with notes of citrus (grapefuit and lemon), pine, spices, herbs, hearty bread and caramel. The taste begins with a big blas of hops: citrusy (grapefruit orange and lemon), pine resiny, and herbal followed by a spicy flavor, and a big toasted bread and caramel malt character that balances the hops. The mouthfeel is full and rich, but not overbearing and drinkability is quite good. An awesome holiday IPA, balanced and complex...one of the best.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,orfeu,4.23,"bright, orangish amber with swirly particulates (hop bits?) and a decent head with largeish bubbles. nose is faint, but i'm mostly getting a mild citrus fruit hoppiness. the taste is bitter hops up front with peachy, citrusy juiciness. juicy is also the predominant mouthfeel, medium body. a nice bitter finish. this is really delicious and easy to drink. easily one to buy by the case every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cubedbee,4.38,"2005 version, 12 oz bottle, seems like it's out a little early this year. Pours a nice looking orange/amber, absolutely clear, 2 fingers of desnse cream colored head, good retention and moderate lacing. Smell is fragrant hops, mainly pine but a little bit flowery, with a slight bit of spices. Taste is a flavorful burst of hops, grapefruit and citrus primarily, trailing into a bold spicey bitter finish. There's a malt taste lingering somewhere in the background, but it never really comes forward, but they do just enough to keep the hops from overwhelming. Medium body, dry finish, and a very smooth feel. And at 6.8% this is no slouch in the alcohol, but I could down these all night. Definitely a great drinkable IPA, wish they would produce it all year, as it is I'll just have to stock up in season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,wcudwight,4.26,"Amber orange in color. Shows a little more red when held to the light. Solid 2 finger lightly golden head that last. Well laced. Hint of spice with some sweetness and hopiness in the nose. Nice balance of malty sweetness and some spice with a bitter backend taste. The balance of sweetness, bitterness, crispness and dryness gives Celebration an excellant mouthfeel. Very drinkable because it is just so good!!! Do not wait for the holidays. If this beer is available go get it now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Sammy,4.08,"2000 edition, scooped at Route 59 Liquor in Monsey, NY. 5 year IPA that still rocked. More like a top Belgian, still well hopped with spicey yeast and barley and grapefruit hop, tastes up front, followed by honey and then bitter finish. Drying. Copper with sizzling white head, lace. Rich full mouthfeel.This is the rating. 2007 edition, still a very good IPA with citrus, above average carbonation, and lacing grooming the glass. Very drinkable, but the 2000 was an award winner.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Naes,4.5,"This brew is amber /orange in color with a one finger white head that leaves very little lacing. The aroma is a nice blend of hops, malt and spice. Hops and spice are the major players in the flavor. There is a nice bitterness near the finish, with a bit of grapefruit presence. Mouth feel is medium in body and nicely carbonated. There is also a bit of oiliness.  This is a beer worth checking out, much better than I expected. It's not an in your face IPA, but still damn good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Px2GrafX,4.7,"presentation: 12oz. bottle with a white label and the the same feel as other sierra nevada labels. banner across the top with ""sierra nevada"", and below that is a small winter wonderland with a cozy lookin' cabin. holly and poinsettas frame the scene and another banner runs across the bottom saying ""celebration ale"". sn's interpretation of their winter ipa is on the neck label. there is a black bar on the right of the label with the number: 5287. batch number? no abv or freshness date.  appearance: pours a beautiful, clear, heated copper with bright red highlights in a tulip glass. inch and a half off-white fluffy head with perfect retention and sticky lacing. a stream of bubbles rise emphatically from the stem of the glass.  smell: lightly spicy with intense citrusy, piney and floral hop aromas. excellent piney christmas tree aroma for the season.  taste: strong hop character. grapefruits with herbal, spicy hop flavors. good bitterness that dries the edges of your tongue. more fruit as the brew warms. oranges and even a nasaly apple flavor as well. there's a lightly sweet nutty malt flavor that's mostly noticible as the brew warms. finishes dry with a spicy hop bitterness. aftertaste is mildly bitter grapefruit.  mouthfeel: seemingly crisp and creamy medium body. super smooth although there's a good amount of carbonation. swallow is silky. near perfect mouthfeel for this style.  drinkability: beer is almost gone by the time i get to the drinkability. 6.8% is nowhere to be found. tasty with an excellent finish and aftertaste that keeps you sipping, or gulping, what have you. excellent quenching winter session.  overall: just an excellent winter ipa every year. i look forward to this release from the second i run out. bitterness is just a touch less than alpha king, but the hop flavor is better. perfect mouthfeel and excellent drinkability. drink it while you can. it seems to disapear as quickly as the season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,asabreed,4.47,"2005 version, poured into my Corsendonk tulip, because I think this deserves something more than a pint glass.  Appearance: Great reddish / brown with slight hints of yellow haze at the bottom of the glass. Lacing's pretty sticky, nice wave-like patterns on the top of the glass, and the head, though dying slightly in the middle although slowly, is still thick around the edges.  Smell: Beautiful oily, piney hops, with some sweeter floral charactertistics and some citrus zest, orange and grapefruit mostly. Balanced as all hell. Also some yeastiness and slight dark bread notes.  Taste: The best thing about this is the slight malt balance that not immediately, but soon after it's swallowed, curbs the biting hops. Certainly for a hophead, so if you're not one you should at least try it, though it may not be your bag. The aftertaste is wonderful, lingering hops and citrus left on the tongue with some yeastiness.  Mouthfeel: Not silky but certainly creamy, a moderately thicker body than I expected. Moderate carbonation. Certainly extremely well done.  Drinkability: Wow, I think I'm going to have to snag a 6-pack to cellar for sure. I had this last year when I didn't know as much about beer, and still enjoyed it then. But now I'm liking it even more. I could see this doing well after just a year, though it's great now. I'd also like to pair it with some food and see what happens. All in all this is a great brew, and it certainly should be tried; it's a celebration after all, I suppose.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Terp96,4.02,Always one of my favorites but was knocked down a notch this year. Pours a deep clear amber with a half inch thick off-white head. Very aromatic. Hints of citrus and pine. Good head retention throughout. Nice hop flavor but not as expected. The aroma did not follow through as strongly in the taste. Definitely a strong hop presence with a complimenting malt flavor but there was an almost pungent finish. Very drinkable. I had three because I couldn't quite figure it out. Not SN's best year.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,doubleipa,4.35,"This beer has a nice hoppy aroma with pine and orange. Definitely smells like a SN. The haed was average with a white, rocky head. There was virtually no lacing and the head disappeared. Th body was clear with a nice amber.orange color. There was moderate hop bitrterness initially that became stronger. The finish was long. It has a medium dry mouthfeel with a good bit of carbonation. There was a nice and surpirsing resin finish. I wish they brewed this one all year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,numenor1,4.3,"Pours a pale, quite clear amber with a half inch, stick head. Reduces to a nice collar. Smells up front of citrusy hops with a definite caramel, bready malt backbone. Sweet caramel upfront gives way to huge fresh juicy hop oils. Not as citrusy as the nose led me to believe, but equally earthy and spicy. Pith emerges through a very toasty, smooth finish laden with spicy hops. Also there's a definite, intriguing hint of of rosemary... Very nice hop character coupled with a tremendous malt backbone. Almost no brash, harsh bitterness, instead it seems restrained and subtle. Mouthfeel is beautiful, medium with creamy carbonation. Perhaps it could be a tad fuller. Sessionable. Didn't lay hop waste to my palate and leave it in ruin as many IPA's tend to. Definitely one of the better IPA's.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,FLAbeergutinMASS,3.97,"Finally I got my hands on some of this elixir. It was worth the wait. The only unfortunate drawback was in its appearance, very pale, not what I had expected. Weak color, almost like a halfhearted attempt at a Pale. Reeks of hops and apricot. The hops blow you away. Not entirely sure what the IBU's are on this one, but they are way up there.  I've been going through this sixer I acquired pretty easily. Thumbs up on the drinkability end.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,macpapi,4.33,"I was shocked and shall we say pleasantly surprised to find this--one of my favorite brews--at the local Bello Vino today. Had to pick it up, despite the early season.  Celebration Ale pours a nice amber/light red color with a good sized tannish head. There is plenty of bubble activity throughout the glass. Good lacing too. A very good looking pour.  Smells malty and hoppy right off the bat. A good presence of spice follows with a slight floral/pine aroma. A very nice and full sniff.  The taste is beutifully light malt with an equal hop kick. Fruit and spices are there as well, rounding out an awesome flavor. SNCA is well carbonated and full in the mouth as well.  Overall, this is an excellent beer. Malt and hops are equal in their presence. A nice kick is also there--probably due to the relatively high alcohol content. Great session brew for any cold late fall or winter night. Time to Celebrate beer!!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,battlekow,4.21,"This is the 2005 version, just released. Pours a reddish-amber with a good off-white head that fades to leave the typical IPA skim. Smells sweetly malty with a substantial infusion of floral and spicy hops. My eye watered a bit when I got my face right in the glass and took a whiff. Flavor has a very malty backbone with hop highlights, a toasty finish, and lingering oily bittering from the hops. The toastiness reminds me of HopDevil. Celebration is a very solid and balanced IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ggroller,4.22,"This is 2005's rendition.  Light amber in color.  Smells hoppy, spicey, cinammony, malty.  Tastes bitter. Very bitter. This one could use some time in the cellar, I think. Only because the bitterness of the hops dominates the taste buds while the spices and malt I smelled don't make it through.  Nice beer overall, though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,poluti,4.08,Pours amberish-orange with a nice head. Nose was pretty hoppy- cascade was present (typical of Sierra Nevada). Initial taste was a hybrid between herbal and spicy. I didn't get a good taste of the malt bill because the hops took over the flavor quickly. The mouthfeel is spicy and a little bitter. It is not overpowering but definitely had a kick on the back of the palate. I would recommend this to someone who is a fan of west coast hopping and is a must if the person is a fan of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Dewey0603,4.38,"A real reddish amber color with a tan two finger head.A very hop filled aroma with hints of spices and a bit malty.This is a great tasting beer.Like the smell,this is very hoppy,then you taste some holiday spices,then you finish with some maltyness.This has a nice medium feel,not too heavy or light.As far as drinkability goes,there aren't too many beers better than this,if you see it ,buy it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,chOAKbarrell,4,"If you like Sierra Nevada's pale ale, but are curious what it would be like if it was taken-up-a-notch, this should be on your ""must try"" list.  A beautiful deep amber color with frothy head that leaves plentiful lacing around the glass.  Taste those trademark S.N. cascade hops. Mmm... A good medium bitterness. Like I said - a bit stronger and more bitter than the pale ale.  The carbonation is just right - no stinging-tongue sensation. Just smooth, pleasurable drinking the whole time.  If you're looking for a great, hop-filled beer, here you go. I'd place Celebration ale right inbetween Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale & Harvest Ale in terms of intensity/bitterness. It's a good step up from the P.A., but not powerful enough to turn off the casual drinker.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,czechsaaz,4.45,"My first bottle of '05 edition  Lots of floral hop aroma. A tinge of the citrussy/grassy American hop types but definitely more floral and herbal than standard SNPA (Pretty much how I remember most years' Celebration.) A little bit of malty honey aroma gets through but it's mostly hops. Hop aroma is fresh and clean.  Nice orange color, good clarity, think white lasting head that leaves nice lacing.  Hint of malt on the front of the tongue, mostly 2-row and a generous amount of crystal. But very quickly hops take over. Pretty high bitterness. There's also a nice spicy hop flavor (almost peppery) and some citrussy hops too. Not grassy at all. There's a nice wash of malt in the mid palate too.  Medium bodied, fairly high carbonation level, creamy.  Still a classic. SNPA with a little more oomph.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,becktone,4.38,"Bought a sixer of this about two to three weeks ago. It obviously has already aged somewhere around a year depending on the date that it was bottled, as I am holding a bottle that boasts ""2004 Celebration Ale."" It pours to be an orangish amber color, the beer is more of an opaque color, and does not allow light to pass through it, rather it sucks it in and traps it. The head to begin with was a nice size. It has fairly decent head retention, although after agitated the head quickly returns to little more than a film on the top of the beer.  The aroma of this beer contains both a malty and hoppy smell. To my nose the maltier smell is dominant over the hoppy smell. Actually when I come to think on it the two smells are pretty well balanced. First I smell a sweeter, maltier smell which seems to be the only aroma this beer has to offer. (this is why I assumed it was predominant) However the aroma finishes with a hoppy bitter smell.  The 2004 celebration ale is very very good. I really like this IPA. When it hits the lips you taste a hoppy beer with a semi sweet but still hoppy aftertaste. The beer has a great balance, the frist thing I taste is the hoppy taste on the back of my tounge followed by more bitterness in the after taste. On first inspection this was all I noticed, however there is a sweet malt taste that hits the front of the tounge at the same time as the hoppy after taste. It isn't quite as strong, and that's why I missed it during the first few sips. In my opinion this is a great balance for an IPA. Plenty of hoppiness with a bit a malt flavor.  In the mouth Celebration Ale is fantastic. It is a full bodied beer as suggestied by it's murky, opaque color. It also has a nice level of carbonation, and is not percieved as under or over carbonated.  For drinkability I have to say only this, I will definitely buy more of this celebration ale, perhaps some of this year's batch, or maybe next year's doesn't really matter when, but I will definitely be buying more of this in the future.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,DogFood11,4.67,"2005 version. Poured into a miniature tulip it forms a loose white head that has nice reteintion and leaves sliding lace. Copper body.  Hops are up front. Its the spices that steal the show in the taste though. Cinnimon, all spice, coriander and then the hops smack ya back to reality. Malt presence is ideal, a perfect dance partner that doesn't step on your feet.  Notes: At this household celebration is a masterpiece and requires owner permission for gobblage. I usually stock up a few cases and drink it over a year. It changes over the year and I find that after a year its starting to fall out of favor. Drink it fresh and stagger it for a vertical for fun.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Golden2wenty1,4.08,"Picked up a sixer at my local corner store, Pinkus McBride, here in Madison.  Pours a vibrant golden yellow with a finger of off-white head which fades to a spotty coating. Smell is harshly bitter, piney hops, and citrus, and grassy grainy malts. Taste starts off heavily bitter with floral/piney hops but smooths out and sweetens up as it warms with citrus and tropical fruits. Mouthfeel is rich for an IPA and nicely carbonated. This is a tasty IPA once it warms, a little harsh if cold - which goes with its winter seasonal theme. Didn't blow me away, but this is a tasty, vibrant pale ale worth trying as the weather gets colder.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I am so glad i said yes.  Pours a wonderful dark gold with a big off white head that gets clumpy and leaves wonderful lacing. The smell just blows you away, citrus hops and caramel malts. This is one of the few beers that i've had that the first taste just makes you say WOW. Wonderful level of hoppiness but so smooth on the finish. Caramel malts balance the hops perfectly. Just a great beer. Ultimate smoothness on the palate and a perfect carbonation level. I stongly recomend this beer to anyone.

140,1904,TheBungyo,4.75,"I just started drinking craft beers a little over a year ago. I tried this one last year just before the new year and thought it was good but not as amazing as many others were saying. I think I even drank it straight from the bottle the last time I tried it. Now I know better. What a difference a year makes for your palate! You yank off the cap and your nose detects the mouth watering scents of sharp citrus and pine before you can even put down the bottle opener. Yeah, this is the stuff! The pour gives way to a burnt orange topped with more than a finger's worth of creamy head. Luscious and tantalizing! You can see the lacing forming as you take the first drink, your mouth full of piney and citrusy goodness. The carbonation is perfect and the mouthfeel full and creamy. I can't see how an IPA could be crafted any better. Thank god my palate has matured because this is truly divine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ClearDog,4.35,"Saw the 2005 Celebration Ale out yesterday at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee. I wasn't sure if I wanted to have it in mid-October so far from the holidays, but what the hell? It's not available year round. The 2004 Celebration Ale was spectacular.  Appearance -- Poured a clear, light orange with an impressive two finger, creamy head. Most of the score is for the head; I personally find an unfiltered IPA to be more visibly appealing. Wet lacing.  Smell -- Nice resinous hop nose. Slight grapefruit. Very faint scent of hay.  Taste -- Bitter hops, but not overwhelming. Kind of tangy. Citrus finish.  Mouthfeel -- Medium feel. Creamy. Nice carbonation.  Drinkability -- Very nice. This is a great holiday ale. You could just as easily enjoy it on a hot summer afternoon. I'm sure I'll be drinking quite a few of these in the next couple of months.

140,1904,roan22,4.21,"This beer in my opinion is a ""spiced"" winter ale that retains the hoppiness of an IPA or pale ale. It's very lacey if you pour it into a glass, and the spices make it very rich-tasting, yummy. It's filling however, so you won't be able to drink too many after eating a holiday dinner.

140,1904,KroMagnon,4.52,"This was the 2004 edition. The beer is a slightly hazy amber color with a decent light-tan head. The aroma is nice, although a bit underpowered, with a nice blend of malt, a touch of a grainy complexity that's a little like caramel but not quite, and a spicey hoppy / ester character that is kind of a blend of cinnamon, cherry, and oak aroma (I have no idea where that comes from but it reminds me of that - I'm not suggesting the beer is aged in oak, though!!) The flavor is nice, with maltiness bordering on sweet without being the least big cloying - I don't know how they pull it off but SN always does. There is a bit of hop note as well. PRobably my biggest hit on the beer is that its been topped by other offerings in terms of ""bigness"", but this remains one of the more drinkable beers in its class and is consistent year-after-year without being boring and predictable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Bonhoeffer,4.58,"Amazing that a brewery as big as SN can produce a beer like this. Also amazing that a beer with only 6.8% alcohol can age so well. I did a mini vertical last night of an 03 and an 04 to see what happens to this little guy over the course of a year.  2004: Nice amber hue. Hops are very up front, lots of aroma. Flavor is dominated by Cascade, but the malt is there. Intensely bitter.  2003: Holy crap. Is this even the same beer? This one is much more magnificent than its younger brother. Hops have mellowed and taken a step back, and there's some sort of amazing flavor here that i didn't detect in the 04. Very spicy and complex. This is indeed a world class brew. Makes me think that this beer may be one to not even bother with until the next year's batch is released.

140,1904,mdavis31481,4.17,"2004 Edition  As I surveyed my refrigerator in search of a libation to celebrate my recent move to New York I was first tempted to imbibe a Dreadnaught or Hercules, but upon further inspection I came across a brew so aptly titled it proved impossible to ignore. Obviously I speak of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale.  The beer pours a hazy dark amber hue with tiny particles seen floating around. The rich, fluffy off-white head slowly dissipates leaving decent lacing. The piney hop aroma is joined by subtle bready malt notes.  The initial sip yields obvious piney hop flavors that are soon joined by malty sweetness. The hops once again assert themselves, but are soon met by malt to finish off the experience. This is one superbly balanced brew. In both taste and aroma, the alcohol becomes more apparent as the beer warms.  The mouthfeel is slightly heavier than the typical IPA and quite enjoyable.  I feel it is important to note this beer is coming up on a year in age. In that time I believe the hops have become somewhat subdued and the carbination has settled down a tad.  Overall Sierra Nevada has produced a fine brew that many do and should envy. I look forward to the 2005 release.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,EPseja,4.15,"Served at just below room temperature in a pint glass. Strange that I had a hankering for this beer on a 94 degree summer evening...  A - Very gently hazed, sunset orange and copper color with aggressive carbonation and an airy, fluffy off-white head. Tons of rising bubble action inside the glass. Excellent, resiny head retention that refuses to let go of the glass.  S - Piny floral hoppiness with grapefruit citrus undertones. Well tamed fruitcake spices. Candy maltiness. Quite excellent.  T - Slightly vinous on the tip of the tongue, changing to a pronounced west-coast hoppiness and malty sweetness in the middle. Citrus flavors and alcohol reveal themselves and the beer moves towards the surprisingly sweet finish. Then comes the big hop bite and the bitter aftertaste that makes you reach for another sip to calm the back of the throat and douse the warm alcohol embers.  M - Slippery as it enters the mouth. Slight foaming turns it into a round, liquid sled that pushes right off down your throat without a hitch.  D - Delicious and well crafted. This one is a staple for any hop lover who wants a spicy kick without being hobbled by the bitterness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,nickss,4.23,"Pours a beautiful amber with big frothy white head. Head slowly subsides.  Smells hoppy, which is not such a coincidence, with a bit of citrus and floral aroma thrown in.  Huge taste... lots of hops and a looong dry aftertaste.  Very creamy in the mouth, almost buttery. Coats your tongue completely.  Definitely a beer I drink frequently... no obvious mistakes or wants out of this beer. While I don't find it spectacular, I must say that this is a very very solid brew.... yet another great brew from SN.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,blitheringidiot,4.12,"Deep orange glowing pour with settling carbonation and tiny miniscule suspended particles floating around, topped off with a pillowy tan foamy head, leaving impressive lace.  Juicy orange citrous scents and some cedar wood notes.  First swigs: Grapefruit slices citrous and dry aftertaste. Nose meets the flavor with woody hints. Malt presence offers a good balance. Acidic yet not overly so.  Generous carbonation with a medium body and feel that lends to an easy Drinkability.  Last swigs: Just a bit less hoppy that the standard SNPA.  Beer is good. Happy beering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,chilidog,4.18,"I got a bottle of 2004, as a gift. Thanks LGM. I saved it till pre-vacation for Sierra Nevada would be along the way. Thisone poured a nice looking amber/copper with a slight haze. The head was almost two-fingers and laced well. The aroma was pleasing of hop, pine and spice. The taste was complex, but very well done.With a smooth caramel malt and a stronger hop texture, the beer is mixed by a nice alcohol blend that warms the body. The taste also brings pine, spice and fruit. The mouthfeel is smooth, alcohol warmth with a finish that dries, like grain/husk. Drinkability, oh ya, easy to let its alcohol sneak up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CAMRAhardliner,4.94,"Wow! SNPA on steroids.  This flawless IPA has a bewildering array of hop flavors and aromas. It pours a reddish copper with a nice dollop of dense foam. The aroma is fruity with floral and resiny notes, very hoppy. The tate is a {celebration} of hops with a firm juicy malt backdrop.  An initial burst of pithy bitterness gives way to beautiful notes of passionfruit, guava, citrus and mango notes. This fruityness is probably from the yeast and the hops. The finish is very piney and lasts forever. Malt is evident even in the finish, making this a perfectly balanced beer. The mouthfeel is luscious and creamy, with the perfect level of carbonation (minimal). I could drink this beer in place of water.  Sierra Nevada makes such kickass beers, the hype is totally justified. This is probably my favorite IPA.  Worthy of my 250th review.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ddarden,4.33,"This beer is a 2004 I have had cellared since Oct of 2004. I also love this beer fresh. SN nudged me to the hoppier side years ago so I will always have a special place in my heart for their beers.  The beer poured a deep clear copper color with a wonderful rocky off white head that left plenty of lacing as I polished this off. This is a great looking IPA. The nose no longer has the traditional IPA smell. The malt really comes out to the forefront with a subdued hop smell. Also still has that same smell all SN beers seem to have, I guess it is from their yeast strain.  The beer still tastes great but different than fresh. This is much more mellow a beer with a great malt to hop balance. The hops are very present on the front and backend with the malt all in the middle. Very nice lingering bitter on the back of the tongue with a good medium mouth feel.  Luckily I have cellared more to compare later. This is a great drinking beer in its current state so I will have to get busy with the ones I have left!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RedwoodGeorge,4.8,"SN Celebration Ale is what finally turned me into a full-fledged hop head and I'm surprised that I've been drinking it for six months and forgot to review it. I've had many, many IPA's since my first Celebration Ale and every bottle I drink (from my quickly dwindling cache) continues to surprise me with just how good a beer can be.  The pour is quite impressive - a medium brown brew with a dirty white head gives some hint that there may be complex roasted caramels in the flavor. The head is thick and sticky and hangs around for a good long time.  The smell is equally inviting - plenty of grassy hops in this brew with an extra dose of grapefruit in case you weren't paying attention. You can also smell a bit of the caramelized sugars which is very reminiscent of golden-brown toast.  The taste - ahhh, the taste.... All the hops that the nose promised with a wonderful malt back to keep things very smooth and well balanced. To start with the malt: certainly caramel flavors, they've roasted that barley good and long to get plenty of burnt sugars. Subtle notes of molasses, bread and grain round out the malt base. Add a bit of fruit notes that you'd find in an amber ale - very subtle hints of peach and apricot compliment the sweet parts of the brew. Then there are the hops, big and bold but not overpowering. Taste-wise the primary note is grapefruit though there is quite a bit of grassy flavor in there as well - you can certainly taste the 'green' in this beer! Minor floral hop notes but only as an afterthought - they're far from the primary flavor.  Mouthfeel is pretty damn good as well - nicely carbonated for lots of fuzz on the tongue. The carbonation also leaves a very nice finish - no heavy aftertastes or oily residue on the palate. This is a medium to light bodied brew; it's more refreshing than weighty.  Drinkability is a solid 5 - there's no debate there. I'm hoarding the last few bottles I've got and slowly doling them out so they'll last me until the next release. Age seems to be quite kind to Celebration Ale - it's getting a bit smoother as time goes on and the hops are a bit less harsh (that or my palate has become more accustomed to a big hop flavor) It feels a bit odd drinking a brew with a snowy winter scene during the summer months but the taste is superb year-round.  [edit 03-15-2006: I want to be clear that I'm reviewing the 2004 SNCA. The 2005, while good, is at best a 4. Less caramel malt presence, more toasted 'burnt' flavor. The hops are more raw and unrefined, age has so far not improved the brew. Here's hoping 2006 is a better year!]",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,danielharper,3.68,"Purchased from Stong Bros. Liquor, Fayetteville TN. 2004 vintage.  This beer poured a nice dark amber color with good clarity but also a high opacity -- no cloudiness, but I couldn't really see through it. Topping this beer was a nice thick bubble-filled head that quickly halved in size, then stuck around for the rest of the beer. I also like the Holiday Theme on the outside of the bottle -- possibly my favorite of the Sierra Nevadas I've seen.  Smell was decent, with a strong hop presence (normal for an IPA) mixed with a sweet red fruit aroma. A bit overbalanced towards the hops for my taste, but overall a nice aroma that makes me think ""IPA"" pretty clearly.  Taste is down a notch from that, as the beer's hoppiness really dominates the flavor, to the point at which it's actually overpowering the fruit completely. Especially as the aftertaste hits me, I find this beer so bitter that it's almost difficult to drink. Perhaps this is to-style for an IPA to some degree, but I would prefer that it be a bit more balanced.  Mouthfeel is decent, with a nice foamy body that coats the tongue, but the carbonation and hoppiness actually burn the mouth a tongue a bit, and make it more difficult to get down. Decent, not unpleasant, but not exactly my taste.  Overall drinkability is decent -- I could pound two or three of these if I had them available, but for the $2.25 that I paid for this single, I can do a lot better. The Bridgeport IPA is still my favorite of the style, although I'll keep an eye out for the 2005 so I can try that when it comes out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Scheity,3.95,"We had this at New Year's, so our season was appropriate for celebration. And after a few of these, the celebration was well-lubricated.  It pours dark amber, a nice shade for the dark winter months. The smell, well, very hoppy and citrus-y. Prepares you well for what's about to happen to your body.  The taste is an onslought of hops, and it fills your entire mouth and nose with the flavor. The hops aren't quite as flavorful as other great IPAs, but you do get the nice flowery scent and wonderfully bitter flavor that will warm you quite nicely.  Tough for a session beer because it's such a heavy and powerful taste. But, luckily, a session with SN Celebration isn't a long one, with its relatively large ABV",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BEERchitect,4.18,"Riding on the heels of recent hop harvests, Sierra Nevada Brewing Company takes advantage with a hop-dominant, yet malty-rich beer that is both hearty enough and zesty enough for a compliment to many winter dishes.  The pour delivers a bright classic amber color with a modest haze. A dance of carbonation fuels a consistent and foamy head that retains as well as beers can and lacing with rings and intermitten patterns throughout. Foam of eggshell color takes on a moussy texture. Could this be the poster child for how IPA's should look? Aside from the richer amber color, I'd say so.  Pungent with citrus and grass, the nose delivers a lush and delicate blend of ruby red grapefruit, pine resin, and floral/flowery notes burried a bit under the malts but come in late in conjunction with sweetly alcohol scent. Spicy and bready, the beer takes on a graham cracker-like aroma that compliment the hops well.  Bread crust flavors of French baguette work with caramel and graham cracker dry/bready yet spicy flavor sets the tone for the malt base, of which provides the springboard for an exquisite display of hop dominance. Sweetness steps aside to allow for sharp, spicy, and vibrant citrus flavor and bitterness delivered by the Cascade hop in such a maner as only Sierra Nevada can deliver. Just shy of sharing the juicy and lush tropical flavors of Centennial, Citra, and Amarillo, this beer's hop profile is nearly ideal. Slightly grassy and vegital because of the leafy residue of whole hop cones, the beer carries a pungent bitterness that compliments the malts as much as it detracts from the crisp hoppiness.  Medium to start, the modestly creamy textures transition to a consistent fade toward a malty/dry mouthfeel just before the finish. Obviously the beer concludes with a long and resiny bitterness with a hoppy dryness that accompanies a minty warming/cooling feel deep into the aftertaste.  A remarkable beer in that it's complex with the malty/hoppy interplay- interesting that such balance and variance in taste can be found in such simple recipe profile. Yet, the beer can be tasted with such ease that it's dangerous at 6.8%. An absolute delight of a beer and a welcome to my drinking rotation each winter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,superdavex,3.98,"This beer poured to a very dark amber. I found this beer to have a very pleasant holiday aroma. This is one hell of a hoppy, fruity beer. Those two main tastes, along with some others, really combine into something very complex. I really couldn't finish too many of these as it is a very heavy, filling beer. Still, a nice treat for the holidays, enjoyed in moderation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ppoitras,4.35,"12oz bottle from somewhere local. 2004 vintage.  Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1 1/4"" light tan head. Beer was clear, dark amber, and laced nicely. Aroma is fruity hops. Taste is also fruity hoppiness, with a reasonable malt backbone, and closes with crisp hop leaves on the tongue. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very good as well.

Smooth and easy to drink with just a bit of alcohol warmth. Very nice anytime.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Star80,4.22,"2004. Pours out a reddish copper, though not nearly as red as it appears on their website. Cream colored head stays intact and laces the glass. Upon first cracking open the bottle, I'm greeted by a spicy hop smell with hints of cinnamon. The beers smell and taste have a distinct grapefruit, resiny pine, and holiday spice character. Malts sit back a bit, but they offer a nice caramel toastyness to the mix. This beer that I'm drinking is probably at least six months old and has had some shift in the flavors. The hops are still there, but have faded as much as 25%. The mouthfeel is about right, perhaps a tad thin. I love this beer fresh and its cult following is well deserved.  I will review next years batch as fresh as possible.  EDIT - Reviewed below, 11/5/2010, new batch  I said that I would review this beer again fresh when given the opportunity, and since I got it before it even hit the sales floor, I would say it's a fresh batch! Beer pours out a copper color with a good inch or so head, smells like pine and some pungent grapefruit, some sweetness from the malt/alcohol in nose. The taste is similar to to smell, but the alcohol sweetness turns into a warming caramel aftertaste that actually balances well with all the hops. Some have said the maltiness in some SN beers can be biscuity, there is a trace of that there too, and a pungent and resinous hops aftetaste from the dry hopping. It would be unfair to judge this beer after it aged because you would lose that extra layer of hops. Anyway, the balance and mouthfeel of the beer is very good for such a hoppy brew. It is quite drinkable in all its glory.  Sooo, few things have changed in five years for this beer, notably its regular year round cousin Torpedo. How does it compare? I don't have one to A/B test right in front of me but I do have to admit this beer isn't quite as lustrous now that I have been enjoying Torpedo fresh lately. I would actually say Torpedo has a bolder hop aroma and an even denser hop flavor. Celebration is more classic California IPA, whereas Torpedo reminds me more of some other IPA from the East Coast, with their tropical tasting hops. Both have a solid maltiness to back it all up and give *some* balance. I would say Celebration is more caramel, Torpedo is more biscuity.  Now, which one do I prefer nowadays? Well, even though I have now reviewed this fresh I can't say I will change any of my rating as they were pretty spot-on. Overall I am lucky that we live in the beer age that we do, and I can get fresh Torpedo anytime at my local grocery store, and still look forward to Celebration in the Winter ;-)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,goonster,3.72,"2001:  I bought a case of 2001, when I thought I was buying 2004. Doh! This is still an interesting exercise, and I can't say I regret the purchase.  Pours turbid with a thick, off-white, creamy head, that is not very persistent. Some lacing. Color is light amber to dark orange. Clarity is poor. Overall the apperance is, ahem, ""chewy.""  Aroma is gentle and sweet, like wildflower honey. Some hops is definitely present in the nose, but very mellow. No alcohol in aroma.  Flavor is full and balanced. Highlights of hop bouquet (normally the featured characteristic of this beer) have faded, but this is still very drinkable and very good. No alcohol flavor or warming. Hop flavor still bests malt sweetness by a smidge.  This beer has aged well, but is presumably quite a bit past its prime. My first bottle was in very good condition, with no oxidation or skunking. This reminds me of a very good ESB with American hop character and no mineral harshness.  Carbonation is moderate and mouthfeel is full, but not heavy. Good, moderate hop bitterness that lasts into finish. Very mild astringency becomes apparent in aftertaste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Aroma was hoppy and full bodied with a few fruity estery type tones.  Mouthfeel was average, with a crisp, medium carbonation reaction on the tongue.  Flavor was a punch in the cascades!, the finish had a little bit of a burnt caramel flavor that melds nicely with the hops.

Smell: the cannabis (not that cannabis guys...the hops!) family meets the rose family in a feast for the nostrils. It smells amazing, but the problem might be the taste...  Taste: Ok people...flowers smell good...but they don't really taste so hot. The brew is quite extraordinary but I must admit that I gave this beer three tries over a couple of weeks and the first two I was simply disgusted. It's bitter and has a taste which inflames the senses but is hard to describe as being good. I finally had my third bottle about a week after I had first tried it and was able to appreciate it. It was a shock at first, but after my taste buds were able to anticipate the taste, it became quite an experience and I can safely say now that I am going to try this again next year.  Mouthful: A litter thicker than the pale ale.  Drinkability: If hops are your thing, this brew certainly can be a session beer.  Notes: I had quite an experience with this beer, almost as if my palate had matured through the experience of a six-pack of Celebration Ale. For that, this beer will always have a special place in my heart.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

This one had very little aroma. The taste sarted a little sweet and then went to bitter with a herb flavor. A very light mouthfeel and quick finish.

I can't figure out why everyone loves this stuff: the taste of burning wood and mint leaves with a powerful jolt of alcohol was too much for me. There was a perfect level of carbonation, though!

There also was a little bit of spice flavor. I scored mouthfeel and drinkability slightly lower because the bitterness was a little more than I liked.

Has that typical west coast hop aroma kicked up a few notches. Very nice. Enough to make a hop head salivate upon first sniff. This is what I want an AIPA to smell like. Its as if someone at SN took a sip of Two Hearted and said, ""Oh yeah...take this!""  Tastes like Bigfoot's little brother. Starts off with a mouthfull of malt and then quickly changes to strong hops, but the transition is a lot smoother than Bigfoot. Perfect mouthfeel for the style. Full but not chewy.  Celebration is a good name for this fine brew as its quite drinkable and makes for an excellent party beer. Not your typical holiday brew as most breweries are making spiced winter warmers while the good folks at SN are kicking this one out, but I like it. I look forward to this one's release every year.

In clear west coast style this beer is screaming with hop character. This beer's color is as attractive as a good Pale can get, with a nice light head. The hop character here is the main experience. Such a nice blend of Hop flavors. Each sip of this beer leaves you with a great citrusy tartness; not for the faint of heart (or pallete).

The beer greets you with a sharp hop bite. It's more than just bitterness or aroma--it's like the hops are integrated into every aspect of the beer, like a resin or sap that adds body. I imagine similar flavors would arise if you chewed on hops. Personally I find this very inviting because it provides real hop flavor on top of the biting bitterness. ymmv.  taste reminds me of orange peel-- there is a strong citrus overtone with a bitter and slightly astringent middle. a nice light citrus sweetness comes through on the front of the tongue, while the back is lashed with wave after wave of hop flavor, culminating in a deep and long-lasting spicy, almost herbal finish and aftertaste. The resin quality just seems to sit in the back of the mouth forever. The malt peeks its head out in the sweet fruit flavors and a bready quality, but the hops are the star.  I know some have said this vintage isn't as good, but i sure as hell like it. I don't remember 2003, but nothing is wrong with 2004 imo.

Slight lacing on glass walls.  Smell is quite good. The first thing I notice is a citrus aroma, followed by hearty hops. Smells spicy and cheerful, just as a celebration ale might I suppose.  Taste is quite smooth considering alcohol content. A crisp edgy hop taste is at the forefront giving way to small citrus and spice nuances. Each taste leaves a lingering pucker. Mouthfeel is delightful. This ale has a certain astringent quality to it, but it is hardly invasive to the overall flavor.  Overall a very drinkable ale worthy of its name.

Nice hop flavor and bitterness. More maltiness than most beers this hoppy. The finish is very bitter. Terrific drinkability  having one always leaves me craving another. This is my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada, and one that I like to pick up a sixer of a couple times a year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,clvand0,4.05,"2004 version. This one pours an amber color with a medium head that falls fast, but leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite hoppy with some spices thrown in for good measure. The flavor has a caramel malt backing, but it is dominated by the American hops. Citrus, grapefruit, slight grassiness. Good body and easy to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kmpitz2,4.32,"Pours a slightly oranged amber color with a 2 finger head that falls to sit healthy atop the beer. The nose is nice, with spicey and citrus hops sitting over a nice healthy caramel malt base. Smells good. The flavor is very hoppy, with a good citrus blast and a nice sweet caramel malt. I relaly like it. The feel is moderate. This beer makes me smile every time I drink it. Its a very nice winter beer, but I think I could enjoy it all year long.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Puddleglum,4.31,"Yummy. Someone pawned this six pack off on me because it didn't taste like the label I suppose. I was more than happy to receive it and enjoy it thoroughly. It has a nice amber, chestnut color with a head that fizzled out pretty quickly. Other than that I was very happy with the snap of the hops and the twang of the malt. I thought it was a nice balance. They may have overdone it with the bitter hops if they were hoping to make it highly drinkable. But one or two will do for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,goodbyeohio,4.01,"red against light, brown in a windowless room. bubbles upon bubbles with mild lacing.  smells like essence of hops. hops. hops. real hops, not like the traditional sierra ipa.  tastes tangy, like a berry sherbet.. with hops quickly taking over with bitterness all over the mouth. yet drinkable and light. the best product in the SN family. wonder how this one would be after a year of sitting in a cellar. unfortunately, that was my last one and the bodega local is out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Backer2004,3.73,"Beautiful reddish-copper hue, thick head, and nice carbonation, like a frothy cloud atop the pint glass. Floral hops accentuated more in the smell than the taste. Very hoppy, can understand why this is considered an IPA instead of a Winter Warmer since it also lacks the spice and cinnamon. Too bitter to be a session brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CortexBomb,3.38,"2004 bottling  Pours out dark orange with black edges and an off-tan head which settles to a solid 1 inch thickness. Nose is lovely with a strong, yet not overwhelming hop presence to go with some undefined sweet aspect and the vaguest hint of pine.  Taste is almost textbook IPA all the way though, the variety of the nose gives way to what I would call a standard American IPA hop bitter on the back of the tongue which almost completely dominates the taste. I get faint hints of malts in the creamy note, and some off-nutty tones when I go fishing for them, but this is predominantly a generic IPA IMO.  Mouth is a notch above average though, good full, carbonated feeling that goes well with the style. The drinkability I only rate average though, largely due to my opinion on over-hopped beers, which this certainly qualifies as.  Strange brew, I bought this thinking it was a warmer, and ended up disappointed when I realised it was only a seasonal IPA. I'm not normally a fan of over-hopped beers, and this offering by SN is no exception. For the hop heads only.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,baiser,4.52,"Pours a dark amber colour, nice head, good retention. Floral aroma, fruity, great hop aroma. In terms of taste, I was expecting something more unique. But it's a typical west coast, hoppy ale, which is fine by me. Taste was fruity, hopped up. Great balance between malt and hops. Juicy and flavourful. Drinkability is exceptional.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GuinnessSmurf,3.52,"Pours a red/orange color with a very small head that dies off quickly. The body appears thin.  Smell is mostly hops - floral and spicy.  Taste is full of hops as expected. There are some subtle sweet flavors that I can't place but round off the flavor nicely.  Overall, its great for long sessions, but doesn't offer much for a single beer experience.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,oracle,4.32,"20 oz draft pour served in a traditional english pint glass.  Beer pour a hazy golden brass/bronze with a dense slightly off white head that left a slight amount of lacing  Aroma was hoppy citrus and pine. Some ripe mild fruit in there as well.  The more Sierra Nevada ales I drink, the more they are all starting to taste the same to me. Maybe they use the same kind of hops in everything, but I think I'm beginning to detect a distinct ""SN"" profile to most of their beers. Upon my first sip of this beer, my first thought was ""Hey, this tastes kinda like the Bigfoot barleywine, with a lot less intensity"".  Still tasted pretty darn good, with lots of hops in front and sweet fruity middle with a dry bitter finish.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,whartontallboy,4.33,"Pours a deep orange/copper with a orange-white head that clings to my glass. Smell is very hoppy, but the malt backing is in there, too, along with some orange. Hoppy taste with some fruit and caramel thrown in for good measure; these citric notes are heavenly. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a great hop aftertaste with lingering orange notes. It's downright tasty, but I usually only have one or two in a sitting; lot of complexity in there to think over.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Gagnonsux,4.03,"Celebration Ale is copper in color with a foamy, creamy head. The head sticks around till the end of the glass and stays fairly foamy for most of the glass. Aroma is entirely of strong citrusy hop smell. The taste is big and hoppy. Strong bitterness in the finish, which lasts a good while after the sip is complete. This is maybe just a little too bitter for it's own good, a little more tasty hop flavor profile might kick the taste up to a 4.5 in my rating scheme. Then again, this is only my 3rd IPA, so what do I really know. Anyhow, I still very much enjoyed Celebration Ale and will be picking it up again next winter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,newyawker,4.4,"Pours a opaque bronze with a big haze and a great, big old head of cotton-candy froth. Smells like the hop forest. Other fruity things going on, and a beautiful, up-front hoppy taste. Bits of malted milkball meets caramel apple flavor notes, and then a bitter, hoppy finish. Not that easy to drink, but very good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,babydoc,4.32,"Methinks I'm becoming a hophead. The 2004 edition pours into a pint glass an orange/amber with a three finger creamy white head that is dense, frothy, and looks stiff enough to sit things on it... it persisted nicely, and left lace on the sides until the beer was, sniff, gone... I'm not sure why others have noted no head at all. The nose jumps at you with fruity citrus hops, a little orange sweetness there, too. Taste is sweet malt backbone that is overwhelmed and bubbling over with citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is creamy initially, a little thinner as I reach the end. The light carbonation seems to bubble on the tongue, and the hops persist to leave the tongue tingling with a touch of bitter long after the beer is down the hatch.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,aquatonex,3.78,"Pours a pleasant burnt orange with minimal head, decent carbonation. Very good lacing throughout. Smells of toasted hops and a little dark malts. A medium-strong hops is most noticeable in the taste along with a heavier body than regular IPAs. Although I'm not a fan of the heavier hopped brews, this definitely had more to offer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,edbeered,4.4,"On tap, this beer is an appealing amber color, with plenty of lacing. The hops are quite evident up front(both in smell and taste), but do not overwhelm the balance of this beer. There is a counterbalancing fruity, almost citrusy taste. What amazes, considering all the complex flavors, is how smooth this beer is(proof that smoothness does not equal blandness). A true classic, by one of the great pioneering craft breweries.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RoyalT,4.48,"Appearance  This poured a dark orange in color out of the tap. It had some brownish notes as well. The head was puffy and very pretty. It showed retention the whole time I drained the pint glass and left some awesome lacing.  Smell  The nice, sharp pine is what I first noticed in this nose. There was also some light citrus and maybe a few other hoppy notes. The healthy malt base gave this IPA a very good balance.  Taste  The hop profile is very complex and reflects the scents found in the nose. The toasted malts come up slightly bigger at the taste and have a small nut compliment. As I said before, this is a very balanced brew.  Mouthfeel  This one is a solid medium bodied, on the bigger side mind you, with a terrific lingering aftertaste.  Drinkability  One of the more quaffable beers that Ive had. On-tap this thing is addictive.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,apintofknowledge,3.5,"Last year (2003), I picked up a six pack of Celebration Ale after hearing so many fellow beer-lovers exalt it's virtues. I only drank one bottle... actually I couldn't even finish the bottle. At that point, I had never had so much hops in my life. Way too bitter for my taste buds. What was everyone so excited about? How could they drink this?!?  A year later, after growing to love a number of brews that I once found too bitter, five remaining bottles of Celebration still awaited. I was curious to see what a difference a year makes.  I'm not sure if it was the year of aging or coming to enjoy the occasional beer with such a strong hops presence, but the Celebration certainly was more drinkable this year. Sure those hops were almost overpowering, and my taste buds had enough after two bottles, but it was enjoyable. I could taste a little orange/citrus flavor, and a touch of sweet malt along with the very persistent bitter and flowery hops. The alcohol taste was still there too, though I assume after a year it was somewhat reduced. Maybe I'll let those three bottles sit for another year, and taste the results.  On a pairing note, drinking Celebration while grazing on a variety of Christmas day appetizers, I found it pairs really nicely with strong cheeses. Not only does the cheese cut some of the bitterness of the hops, but the ale seems to bring out more flavor from the cheese.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cncbofh,4.35,"What a little beauty. I had not heard of the Celebration Ale from anyone - so when I first purchased it, all I could think of was a typical Christmas ale... something with spices, lots of alcohol and a deep chewy flavor.  Holy cow! It's a Christmas Pale Ale and it's killer!!! The hops are powerful. Strong spicy citrus scent - can use this thing for a room freshener. Hope you like the smell of hops.  The taste is a small bit of malt swallowed by a humongous overload of citrusy hops. There is alcohol present, but it's not overwhelming and is well balanced with the brew. God this smells good and tastes great. Excellent beer for around the tree - or menorah, or buddha... hell, even atheists can enjoy Christmas with this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MuddyFeet,2.73,"Waiting for the backlash on this, but I just don't like the taste of wood polisher... errrr... pine in my beer. Wreaths stay on the door, they do not belong in my beer. While I do very much enjoy the hops in the beer, the pine just kills any joy I get from this beer. There are also hints of caramel and spices, but the pine just shoots them down in my opinion. I will admit this is not as pungent a pine as I've had compared to other beers, but I can still taste it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Guinness4me,3.03,"In an attempt to not offend the hop heads of the bunch, I'll be as kind as possible with this beer as it does seem like a good example of the style.  The color was a lovely golden/orange color with a white head full of tiny bubbles. The smell was 110% hops to nearly the point of a flowery perfume.  The taste was all hops with a slight, sweet malt and a very bitter finish that tended to linger on the back of my tongue.  The mouthfeel was neither offensive nor spectacular but again is indicative of the style. I'm glad to get this one over.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mrfosters,3.5,"Wow. What happened? Maybe I got a mishandled six pack. Don't get me wrong this is not horrible ,but it's certainly nowhere near the past versions.It poured a dark amber ,but with very little head and the lacing was non exsistant.It seemed very subdued in all aspects ,not really spicy ,not hoppy, not much more than an average IPA.I look forward to this every year and sadly ,this year I was dissappointed.But as I said , maybe ,I hope, I just got a sixer that was somehow mishandeled . I'll see if I can still find this somewhere else and rerate it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I finally found this beer at Whole Foods in the Chelsea section of Manhatten after searching around my local distributors for weeks. This beer is consistent year after year. Too bad it's not available year round. A rock solid IPA that is very drinkable despite it's 6.8 ABV. With all the over the top seasonal beers out there I've tried, I always find myself going back to this classic IPA. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". This beer will go down in the annals of American brewing as the classic IPA that all others are compared too. Please Sierra Nevada, make this available year round!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CBFanWish,4.41,"A fantastic offering from Sierra Nevada. Pours a bronze colour with a thick foamy head. A sweet malty aroma wakes you up with hints of pine.

A great beer for just about anything.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,maccroz,4.56,"Wow! This beer packs a punch on every level. The appearance is perfect. Dark and golden with a small but evident head. It smells seductive enough to inspire a pavlovian watering of the mouth.  The first sip is what will get you though. It's a flood of hops and so many other tastes that you can't put your finger on any of them. From the moment it hits the tip of your tongue to the moment you swallow it's a safari of tastes and sensations.  I doubt you'd be able to drink too many of these in one sitting though, not only is it complex on the tongue, but it also packs a 6.8% punch.  Give this one a shot for sure!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,rowew,4.6,This one was on tap at Falling Rock - so my review isn't as detailed as usual. All in all a fantastic beer that I look forward to having again in the future. Poured a beautiful bright amber color with a nice head that left a lot of lacing as it drained. Fresh hops and citrus flavor dominate - with just enough malty undertones to keep it reasonable (but this one is definitely for hop-heads). Great creamy mouthfeel,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Crotor,3.38,"2003 bottle, cellared until consumption in mid December, 2004.  Pours dark amber, rather cloudy with chunks floating around - I must've kicked up the sediment. Great, dimpled, off white, lingering head (1 finger).  There's a slight pine-resin aroma, and a bit of grapefruit - the hops are subdued but still there. Not much else to the aroma. Really kinda underwhelming, actually. The volume on the hop aroma is turned down, but the volume on the malt aroma hasn't been turned up.  My first impression when I drink is of the creamy, smooth mouthfeel. There's a nice bit of caramel underneath it all, but it hasn't really opened up yet (will it?) Damn, this stuff feels downright creamy right now - great mouthfeel. Ooh, but now those citric hops are rearing their head; amazing, the power left in 'em.  Overall, a nicely incorporated, balanced flavor. However, I find myself missing the full strength of the hops in fresh Celebration. This is my first experience with cellared Celebration, and though it's certainly good, I simply prefer it fresh. I think I'm gonna go pull those six-packs of '04 back out of the cellar, and drink 'em this season instead...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Suds,4.15,"2004 Celebration: bronze colored liquid with an off-white, firm, rocky head. Sticky lace. The beer is cloudy from yeast sediment. The aroma is thick of piney hops. Its an intense aroma: a wake-me-up peppery, outdoorsy, full-on Northwest smell. Hint of malt underneath the hops. Tongue numbingly bitter, with a dry, crisp, very refreshing finish. Id love this beer year-round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JackStraw22,4.45,"(2004) Beer pours a crisp golden/amber with a nice 1-2 inch foamy head, good retention, nice lacing too. There's a pleasent ""ale"" aroma. Fruity esters from the hops are present, I can smell some nutmeg and ginger too (or else I've just been eating too many cookies lately) I think I can smell some malt too, but not much. Very hoppy as I would expect from SN, phenomenal!! Wow! Spicey, piney not too sweet. This beer tastes like Christmas. I want one of these while opening my presents this year (which will hopefully be more of these). Exceptional drinkablity for the hoppiness, could go with these all night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Skywave,4.39,"Good stuff. Pours to a creamy white head and orangey color. Aroma is hop-dominated with a good deal of pale maltiness shining through. Flavor is bittersweet, quite well-balanced for an American IPA, strong bitterness with a sweet malt backbone holding it up. Very pleasant IPA aftertaste and mouthfeel. Wow. I bought this not knowing it was an IPA (I had bought Pyramid IPA to serve at the Xmas party along with this beer, Czechvar and my homebrewed stout). It is excellent. It has the right balance of slightly toasty-caramel maltiness and the generous bitterness, flavor and aroma of the finest U.S. ale hops. Worth the extra money. A sixpack of Celebration Ale costs over $9 in OK and I consider it more worth the expense than the $7.50 for any Pyramid beer, incuding the IPA!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,sabrills70,3.9,"Pours a beautiful medium amber with a huge head and great lace. Smell of fruity citrusy hops. Great floral hoppiness. Taste of fruity hoppiness with a nice amount of bitternes. Not too bitter though. A great example of an American IPA. No detection of the 7% alcohol anywhere. Its mouthfeel is very nice. Not too light or too heavy. Its drinkability is only slightly above average because I just can't drink a bunch of IPA's in a row. I enjoy them very much, just not a bunch at once. I will savor the other 5 of these through the holiday season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PossumJenkins,3.97,"Bought a single of this at the local beer store for $1.59. An excellent beer for anytime, not just the holidays. Probably the best IPA I've had in my relatively limited experience (though I have a Dogfish 90 Minute waiting for me in the fridge). Nothing special about the appearance, typical light brown color with nice, lasting head and ok lacing. Smell is very fruity - I can't place a finger on which particular fruit though. Something citrusy, like lemon or grapefruit even. Man, this is a hoppy beer. Might be too bitter for some, but I love me some hops. Drinkability is way up there...despite the 7% ABV I feel like I could easily make this a ""session"" beer.

140,1904,moocey,4.47,"Nearly 7% alcohol?! Bullshit. Where's it hiding? I drank this one at room temp. Pours a wonderful clear amber color with a crazy amount of head. I'm immediately smaked upon the nose with the wonderful cascade hop. Smells delicious. This beer starts of with a citrusy aroma, but it ends with a grassy, hoppy bitter chinook bite. After a couple of sips I can pick up some of the grassyness in the aroma. There's just so much going on with this beer. Such complex hoppyness, and dry as a bone. Nothing sweet here. This is one of the most delicious beers I've ever tasted. I have five more of these to drink! I doubt I'll refridgerate any of them.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,lackenhauser,4.45,"Poured a nice orange to reddish amber color. Great carbonation level and some nice lacing on down the glass. Wonderful hop aroma-very citrusy. Doesnt scream at you like some US IPAs. Fantastic malty flavor with a huge rush of hops. Lemony,grapefruit like-a real pucker upper!!! Great silky smooth body helps to somewhat subdue the hops. A killer beer every year. This is one that doesnt seem to change year after year when released. Definately a classic.  Note-Sampled a 2000 vintage bottle earlier this week. While the hops had dimished it was definately showing its age. Not unpleasant but was past its prime for sure. Had a slightly ""off"" flavor. I wouldnt call it rancid but it was off to be sure. If youre cellaring this one Id suggest diving in. Malt flavor and body were there-just had an untangible element to it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RushLimbmalt,4.32,Pours a nice amber and has a big off white head that leaves gobs of sticky lace. The hops attack the nose as soon as the glass gets anywhere near my nose. Very nice! They are very up-front in the flavor as well and they are a nice floral assault on the tongue. This is a very good American IPA. It is quite drinkable. I would like to try it on tap sometime.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GreenWBush,3.29,"Don't get me wrong, I love this beer. I just feel like 2004's release has been completely hit or miss: the first batch I had was astonishingly perfumed grapefruit, the second was on par with Ruination's sheer bitterness, and now on-tap i've got a totally different animal. Seems completely out of line with the Sierra Nevada ethos.  A dry, stale Chinook overloaded let down. Got absolutely blown out of the water by a semi-fresh keg of Stone IPA.  For a brewery that prides itself on uniformity, this year's celebration is surely not worth celebrating over.

First impression was a little dry for my taste, but by the end of the glass I was hooked. I've come to know this as a great sessionbeer,but the 6.8% ABV will ensnare the unknowing or the unwary.

140,1904,Erix,4.54,"From bottle to pint glass Appearance: A moderately vigorous pour yielded a substantial, lasting, pale khaki head. The beer itself looks allright, and is a reddish gold, but there is rather a lot of sediment in there. Smell: Citrusy hops here, with sweet malt to back it up. Great aroma to this beer. Taste: Hops are of course the most assertive flavor here, hitting you right up front. Bitter grapefruit primarily, and a little bit of oak in there too, towards the end. The malt is present, and does a good job of providing some depth and balance to the hops, but they dont really try to compete. Bitterness stays for a while after you've finished each sip. Delicious. Mouthfeel: Full and oily, but the sharpness of the carbonation seems to power the oil away. Actually rather refreshing. Drinkability: I don't think that I could ever tire of this beer.

140,1904,mynie,5,"2015: I opened my first Celebration of the season and teared up, like some kind of girl. This beer is, easily, the best part of early winter. Every year it's like welcoming an old friend back into my life. And while it's pretty sad to refer to a beer as an old friend, it would be a lie to deny doing it. I'm honest, man. Beer matters a lot. And few, maybe none, matter as much as Celebration.  2013: This was the first aggressively citrusy hoppy beer I ever had. It was one of--maybe THE--first aggressively citrusy hoppy beers. And it's still perfect. Right now, the best hoppy beers (like Kern River or Heady) taste like Snickers bars. This is not that intense. But it's still great enough to have invented an entire style, and you have no right to call yourself a BA if you don't give it its due.  2004: Very red, pretty color. Excellent head that refuses to die. Great lacing.  It smells like sweet caramel and hops. There's a bit of a spicy smell that falls somewhere between cloves and nutmeg.  Tastes like hops upfront with warmer spices, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, pumpkin pie. More hops in the back, sweeter than the front, but still bitter, and with more spice. The aftertaste is bitter hops with sour leanings, kind of like an orange rind dipped in cloves.  What can I say? This beer lives up to the hype. Too bad the only store near me fucking gouges on the price ($11.00 for a sixer!!!) or I'd probably buy a case to enjoy until next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

This is a very interesting IPA. Hops cover up any malt to my taste. Very crisp finish makes for a most drinkable winter style ale.Sierra Nevada has brewed a fine one here  Winter 2004 edition: Just about a perfect pour, with an actively carbonated, bronze amber body topped by a one finger offwhite head that hangs around like a new kitten that's starved for attention. Massive sheet and patch lace decorate the glass. Aroma has an ideal balance of caramel and toffee malt and grapefruit and orange citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Taste mirrors the aroma, with an ideal blend of citrusy, westcoast hops and caramel and toffee malts. The hops lend a touch of wintry pine cone, as well. Crisp on the finish, with a nice hoppy aftertaste. An American IPA that purrs on all cylinders. Drinkability: I know some people that are cellaring this one until 2005, and beyond.

Initial head of ½ inch fluff that is creamy in appearance with some larger stuff going on at the outer edges. Celebratory hop front on nose with just a jack of candy cane sweetness flitting about aimlessly in the eaves. Gaudschalk frizziness of hop that almost stings on the tongue and back of throat and simply engulfs any washing holiday spices that I think must be hidden in there, somewhere. Really seems like this could do with some more mellowing; an oddly low-tide mud flat finishing to the pour brings the party down to a murmur for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,claytri,2.31,The ale poured a beautiful bronze with a georgeous rocky white head. The aroma was essentially of hops very floral. The taste was really pretty one dimensional it was sharp and hoppy and nothing else. The body was medium dry finish. This beer was a real disappointment. I was expecting something complex and maybe spicy instead I got nothing but hops. It was also very unpleasant to drink with chilli.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BrewMaster,4.53,"Appearance: 2004, Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Color is golden amber with an off white head. It has a nice fluggy head with great retention and lacing on the side of the glass as the beer is consumed.  Smell: Sweet hoppy floral nose. I had no idea this was supposed to be an IPA, but as soon as I smell it, it was clear that this was an IPA in very true California style.  Taste: Very sweet with a clean hoppy flavor up front. Notes of cinnamon, clove, fruity esters, and a hop bitterness lingering at the end.  Mouthfeel: It's medium bodied and smooth on the palate without any uncomfortable stickiness.  Drinkability: Easily one of the best Christmas releases I've had. I will gladly enjoy this again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PorterLambic,4.08,"After my unpleasant experience with Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot Ale, I've been reluctant to get back on their horse for quite a while. However, my friend the bartender :) and fellow BeerAdvocate suggested this and highly recommended it. Well, why not?  Pulled (by hand) a beautiful dark golden honey colored brew with a big, creamy, fluffy tan head and wonderful lace. Smell is mostly hops with undefineable fruit, spices and malt all in the background. Well, an IPA is expected to be heavy on the hops. Taste is, of course, hoppy with spice, malt, fruit, bread and alcohol also showing up for the party. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, very unexpected and welcomed. Warms the throat all the way down. Drinkability is good. A nice brew especially on a cool Florida winters' night. All things considered, I'll be riding the Sierra Nevada horses a little more often now. I guess Bigfoot was just an ornery old mule.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,oxmasterscream,4.5,"Gorgeous amber with a massive, fluffy head that looks like egg-whites beaten to stiff peaks. Smell is practically all hops... first some grapefruit/citrus aromas and then lots and lots of spruce. Just a hint of honey in there. Tastes exactly how it smells. Spruce flavors dominate, a bit of citrus, and an extremely mouth-drying, extremely bitter finish. Mouth is smooth and slightly creamy with light carbonation. One for the hop heads.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,blitz134,4.28,"This is my all-time fav session beer. Too bad it only comes out in the winter. It isn't quite a winter brew in the typical sense, but its mighty tasty none the less. Its about time I got around to reviewing this one.  Pours a redish, caramel color with about a one finger off white head which disappears into a slight coating on the surface. Aroma is a very aromatic blend of flowery hops. Just from the smell one can tell this is going to be a hoppy brew. Taste is very sharp and pungent. The immediate hit of hops is very pleasing, and quite balanced in flavor. I don't pick up much of any one hop in this beer, but there is an overall piney flavor. I think the carbonation really helps how sharp this beer comes off. Mouth feel is a little above average, a bit thin but the flavor still lingers for a bit.  Drinkability is what this beer is about. The hoppiness doesn't overpower at all. Like I said above...my all-time fav for a great session brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,farHillsBrewer,4.79,"I've bought at least a case of SNCA every year since 1993 and consider it one of my all time favorites. A truly legendary beer. I know at least a dozen people who independently have told me it is their favorite beer. Although a seasonal, served at pubs starting every November, there is no spice added. It is purely malt and hops, or rather hops, hops, malt and more hops. The predominant hop is Cascade, but it is dry-hopped with Centennial. When a bottle in uncapped, you can smell the hops across the room. The hoppiness pervades throughout, from the bittering, to the flavor, and on into the aroma and the extensive length. Then aftertaste has you puckering, but the malt sweetness in the next mouthfull, starts you off the at the other end of the scale, circles you through the spectrum, over and over again. Although a consistent 6.8% ABV, and quite bitter, it's easy to pop open another, or to drink by the pitcher in draft form. As an example of an American IPA, it is the standard. The color is dark copper with a frothy head that generously laces your glass in a series of parallel lines all the way down. Islands of ""dirty"" hops float on top of the liquid, sparking daydreams as you savor the excellence of the beer known as Celebration.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,skybluewater,4.2,"Pours a murky amber color. Very odd head that leaves almost no lace. Smells much the same as SNPA, but amplified, mostly pine and tropical fruit. Taste as well is similar to SNPA, but more malt and hops.  Overall, this is a very nice IPA. Perhaps a bit ""raw"" right now, but still very tasty. I wish it were available year round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SCW,4.5,"Every year I look forward to trying Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale. This beer is now so legendary as a seasonal offering that you have dozens of other microbreweries and brewpubs across the nation offering a similar winter seasonal. And remember, they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  The beer poured a deep amber color. As usual for Sierra Nevada, the head retention was excellent.  The aroma was a mix of spicy hops and caramel. The type of rich malt base in the aroma was a preclude of what was to come... which is usually a full-bodied sweetness.  And it came. A remarkable balance earns this beer top honors in taste.  All in all, a very drinkable brew. I think I'll buy another six pack soon.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,inebrius,3.46,11/25/04: Que Paso? Drinkability? Ever had spruce tea? Was I stoned down there in 2003 or am I stoned now?  01/12/03: It's beauty is in its drinkability. I find it difficult to believe that Sierra Nevada keeps this brew seasonal. Heady copper. Citrus leaf and roasted nut nose.

140,1904,mgdeth,4.35,"Appearance - Thick tan head forms on the pour. Color is reddish amber. There is a slight suspended haze in the beer which looks likle it could be yeast and/or spices. There is also a bit of yeast left over in the bottle.  Smell - There is a strong hop nose on this beer. Malt aroma is also present, but is not as strong. This seems appropriate to the style.  Taste - This is a delightful mix of hop bitterness, malt, and spice. the hops really stand out more than anything else, and the spicy flavors are very subtle. Maybe the ""spice"" is really the complexity of the hops. Hop bittness lingers in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - This beer has a pretty thick and chewy mouthfeel. for something sold as a holiday beer, this is a good thing.  Drinkability - The taste and aroma of the beer are so inviting that it is difficult to put down. It is a bit on the heavy side, but I'd like another!  Comments - This really is an ale worth celebrating. The aroma combined with the taste of this beer makes it really outstanding.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,watermelonman,3.73,"This poured to a bright and pretty shade of red and orange. The head is medium and has good retention, and it's leaving gobs of lace behind.  The smell is literally a punch of raw hops. The taste follows a similar line, with the malt profile detectable up front but quickly fading in the finish. The mouthfeel is definitely good, being sharp without being too sharp.  The hop flavor seems very raw. It's not overwhelming or totally out of balance, but I think being just a bit more mellow would help the taste. Aging this thing just might do the trick.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,rousee,4.07,"I know all my BA brethren love this beer so I am trying it again with some mix of high expectations and skepticism. I hope I'm doing the right thing here as the photo is for 2001 vintage and I am having 04's.  Pours almost see-through amber-no head, no lace, but it does have some continuing carbonation which is a little surprising. Smells sappy and rich, not too overspiced --it has been several years since I have tried one of these and maybe I was unfair to think poorly of it.  It tastes very piney-malty and rich. It is a little barleywine-esque but not too far there for it to bother me as I am not a barleywine fan. It has some cinnamon and finishes pine-sappy which I rather like. It is almost an ideal example of the celebration type brew, yet there are others of this ilk that I am more willing to give a higher score.  Mouthfeel is good although maybe a bit too sticky on the finish. Drinkability is average. If you want more than 2 of these, you need to have your head examined.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,wailingwench,3.29,"I thought that this was going to be winter warmer style. Celebration should ""fall"" into the autumn/harvest category. They seriously need to remove the references to a cabin in the mountains cloaked in snow, the red coloring of the label, and the poinsettas. Bad SN. Bad.  This brew suffers from the hyped up syndrome. It is not stellar, interesting, unique, or seasonal to rate its high rating.  Eye Candy: Appearance here will be degraded due to misleading bottle label. Deep amber with thick 2 finger head. Superb retention and hop clumping. Risiing carbonation bubbles vanished halfway through, lending to the posssibility of a thicker brew.  The Nose Knows: Initial honey-like sweet malts that give way to a floral and finish piney.  Tongueland: Quick dash of sweetness rapidly killed by grapefruit-citrus and finishes resinous piney. Lingering but not oily. Nice clean finish.  Bender factor: I am partial to Souther Tier Harvest, it is a better brew than this. When SN wants to own up that Celebration is not a winter brew, I will try it again. Otherwise, it will not find a place in my fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mattcrill,4,"2004 Celebration Ale printed on the neck of the bottle.  Appearance: A hazy deep copper color with a crusty, light tan head. Nice lacings throughout the beer.  Smell: ""West coast"" hop oils, pine, and a floral citrus aroma definitely dominate. There is some carmel sweetness noted but it's definitely in the background.  Taste: Grapefruit, oily pine, and orange are the first things that jump on my palate. There is a subtle honey flavor that peaks through and then a warming alcohol finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, multi-dimensional, and very complex.  Drinkability: Suffers a bit just because I can't see making a session out of it. But a very nice beer.  Tasting notes: I have no other years for comparison and from what I've read, this isn't the best year. As far as I'm concerned, this is a solid IPA and dead-on for the style.

I was excited to finally pick this beer up. 12 oz brown bottle and served in a goblet.  Reddish orange haze color with a major head on top. Sudsy sticky lacings all over the glass.  Major hop whiffs on the aroma. Smells like a hoppy ""west coast "" (a la Rogue or Stone) treat. Fruity and hoppy nose.  Sweet maltness up front with flavors of caramel and fruit. Strong hop bitterness. Blends of different hop flavors are making a statement in this beer. Creamy smoothness with just a tad of alcohol warmth.  The best winter seasonal I've had yet this season.

Clean and crisp reddish-copper in color.  Lemon, floral hops, and a bit of hop oils. A touch of wheat, but the main aroma is a bright, citrus filled hop nose.  Lemon and citrus hop flavors at first that give way to a huge grainy-hop flavor. The bitterness kicks in almost immediately and last until the pine and citrus filled aftertaste. A mild malt character is present that doesn't really stand a chance against the hop intensity. Filled with a strong hop flavor any hophead would enjoy.  Medium bodied; modest amount of carbonation. Extremely grainy on the palate regardless of the amount of hops used.  This is a hefty IPA given the 6.8% abv and the high hop character. An IPA fit for the winter season, but it's tough to drink this as a session beer. A 'good' IPA IMO that I feel gets a bit more credit than it deserves.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HochFliegen,3.46,Poured a nice deep orange/copper color with a nice frothy head. Smell was mainly a citrus hop like smell with a slight hint of a malt sweetness to it. Nothing to overwhelming. It was pleasant however. The taste was good like most Sierra Nevada poducts.

140,1904,AndIWantYou,3.66,"I like the burnt orange color (despite my inherent bias that strong beers should be dark) and the head laces nicely. Smell is nothing really special for me, although I may be catching a cold--just smells like any random pale ale to me.  Full bodied with heavy carbonation, the beer feels almost like an electric shock if I let it linger on the tip of my tongue. Bare hint of alcohol note in the palate, but mostly I taste hops and feel a lingering warmth at the back of my throat.  Basically, an inexpensive but pleasurable experience...

140,1904,zacharius,4.32,"2004 version: This beer pours an dark amber with an oily foamy off white head. Aroma is floral citrusy hops can't really smell anything else but it smells real good. Taste is a repeat of the citrusy hops, hint of toffeelike malt underneath. Long aftertaste of hops like you were sucking on a hop cone, I don't think it ever goes away but eventually you just stop noticing it. Great drinkability especially for the alcohol content.

The taste is hoppy up front, very malty in the middle, and dry and hoppy in the finish. This one really gives you some piney, hop burps! The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the drinkability is pretty awesome as well. A classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Quaffer,4.83,"2002 batch. Just purchased within the last week, so there was no aging done on my part.  Appearance: This beer was a slightly hazey, brown-to-copper color. It was not too light or too dark. The light tan head rose up huge (probably due to my clumsy, neanderthal-like pour) and sank down slowly, becoming rocky as it did so. There was a thin layer that persisted the entire drink. This beer left a huge amount of lace. Sometimes there were even big ol' chunks of head stuck to the sides of the glass. Good stuff.  Smell: Hops, hops, and more hops! Right after the pour, that was all I could detect in the aroma. After the beer settled down, I could pick out mild citrus notes and some caramel and malt.  Mouthfeel: This brew was much smoother than I expected. It had a big, full feel that was almost silky. This could also be partially attributed to my initial clumsiness on pouring, however.  Taste: Hop, hops, and more hops! (Deja vu, eh?) This beer had a huge hop flavor that was terrific. There were also notes of citrus and flowers, though those can be attributed to the hops as well. Some malt flavors were present, but there had to be much more than I noticed to balance out this beer. Overall, very refreshing and delicious.  As a hop head, I loved this beer. The balance might be swung to the hoppy side in this brew, but it does not make the beer harsh or unpleasant. It is almost like the malt/hops ratio is just on the edge of being *too* hoppy.  UPDATE, 08/05/2003  After a number of months in the bottle, this beer has mellowed somewhat. The hops has lost some of its edge and the brew has become more malty, gaining more caramel tones and a very noticeable butter component. This hasn't happended with all bottles, though. (I've burned through about 5 cases of the 2002 release.) Some are still pretty damn hoppy. Still, an absolutely wonderful beer. My supply for the year is almost exhausted, so I am eagerly anticipating the 2003 release.  UPDATE, 11/10/2004  The 2003 release of this beer was great, and the newly arrived 2004 is spectacular. I have to bump my ratings for this beer even higher this year. This is the most consistently beautiful, and almost perfect, beer that I have ever had. To have something of this high caliber in large quantities at a reasonable price is truly amazing.  Appearance wise, I've decided that this beer is perfect. The color, the light haze, the beautiful sticky head, and the incredible amounts of lace that are left behind make this beer look like it should be on the cover of every beer related publication ever produced.  I've also decided that the flavor is perfect also. Well, at least for me it is.  Drinkabily will also get bumped to a five because this is my staple beer when it is available. I will put away cases of this stuff and still yearn for more. When it is gone, I am immediately anticipating next years release.  This has to beer my favorite beer of all time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,oggg,3.89,"First, I think this was smoother on tap.  This beer pours a nice orange brown with a surprisingly nice thick lasting head. Clear.  Strong and beautiful floral hop aroma. Some citrus and pine.  Oooh, this beer has a surprisingly brutal hop bitterness up front. The bitterness fades quickly and allows the citrus and pine to come out. Harsh alcohol crashes the party in the middle. Finish still is fairly dry.  Overall: I could buy this beer and just keep it around for sniffing. The flavor is a bit unbalanced and rough.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Rio,4.45,"2004 release, enjoyed on 11/08/04  Pours a deep chesnut with a tall, two-finger thick, light-tan colored head that receeded to open up in the middle, and leave itself clinging to the sides of the glass. Strong smell of hops instantly floods the nose, while a slight spicy aroma hangs around the edges.  As expected, hops overwhelm the tastebuds right away, letting a slight malty-sweetness to follow up. Hop bitterness isn't overwhelming, but is strong and solid here, and the carbonation is just perfect. While it is pretty smooth going down, it leaves a bit of an oily feel in the mouth I hadn't noticed from other IPAs, which is the only thing I don't like about this brew.  I hear so much about this beer (as well as SN's Bigfoot), and I've finally gotten to taste it. It does not disappoint. I regret only picking up a sixer now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,heidelbeerg,4.38,Found this beer on tap at the Pittsburgh Bottleshop Cafe. Wow. What a brew ! Beautiful amber/copper color with a rich creamy off white head. Smell is mostly hops and citrus. Very nice. The taste was unbelievable. Very hoppy with a nice fruity flavor. The fruitiness reminds me of a late harvest white wine without being sweet. Did I mention very hoppy ? The mouth feel was just about perfect. The carbonation is just right. Drinkability is dangerously high. If I can find a case of this stuff I will certainly buy it.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It has a medium mouth feel . Very drinkable. I now see what all of the fuss is about.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mntlover,4.23,"Finally got to get mine. Pours a ruby amber color with a nice off white head stays a while and laces nicely. Aroma is malt lots of hops, floral and ctirus combined some fruity aromas coming from citrus hops? or somewhere else like a big gumby bear of hops just smells juicey. Tastes of malt to start then hops lots of hops dominating this beer grapefruity bitter. Starts out lightly sweet with floral hop flavors blending with the sweetness then the bitter grapefruit comes up with carbonation leading the way and announces itself all else falls away to bitterness for a while then it fades some and sweetness is tasted again as it finishes. This beer leaves a nice hop resin coating on your tounge to remind you its time for another drink. Mouthfeel is a good solid meium drinkability is also good nice hop strong regular IPA very good but not quite a masterpiece. After finally getting to taste some I can see why people talk of cellaring it.

140,1904,FormatKid,4.33,"One of the beers I have been looking forward to trying since I first started getting into craft beer almost a year ago. The label is somehow psychologically soothing, and I like it. It pours out of the bottle like beaten copper with a ruby tinge. A big bubbly head rolls up and clings in loving lace patterns in big chunks of froth. The vision of the beer itself is almost hypnotically soothing, watching the head slowly recede and leave those patterns of lace on the glass. Once I take a whiff I get somewhat of a wake up call though. Sweet sticky malts over-come by resinous pine aromas, lemon grass, and citrus rinds. The combination is almost candy-sweet, but brash and assertive at the same time. This beer tastes great as well. The malts are present and nicely sweet, but light on the tongue. The hops, obviously, dominate this beervibrating mid-pallate like I had a penny on my tongue. Resinous pine and bitter citrus rind present themselves toward the finish, very lovely. A great IPA with classic Sierra Nevada style. Let me say that I love this beer, but there are some behemoths in the IPA category that are really hard to touch, Sierra Nevada still does an awesome job with this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,krberg,3.9,"2004  Bright and red with an off-white head. Somebody might mistake this for a Killians if they had lost their nose in some sort of accident.  Sinus-sticking aroma! Mostly hop but a few sugary malt notes poke through now and then.  I must be losing all sensitivity to hops, because it doesn't seem super-hoppy like I remember (and love). It is bitter, and there are fleeting moments of flavor hops that appear as a slight tangyness. The malt backbone reminds me of savory pastries or mild nuts. There is a big CO2 bite in the first few sips which, I found, initially obscures the flavors.  Nice rich, full mouthfeel. Very beer-like.  I can and have had quite a few of these (not right at this moment). Especially when they are first released and in the late spring and early summer months when I happen on a leftover case or two.  These days it is getting harder to distinguish yourself in the AIPA category. I think that SN Celebration is getting a bit dated. It is a good beer, but I can have exciting fresh, local AIPAs all year now and that, as much as it pains me to say, makes this beer less magical.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Gusler,4.42,"(2004 Release) The beer decamps the 12-ounce stubby brown bottle a limpid burnished copper color with a gigantic semi-creamy light tan head after its decomposition leaves a thick blanket of lace to obscure the glass. Nose has a slight hint of hops with a sweet malt backing, crisp and clean to the senses with the start sweet and the malt profile pleasant, the top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is striking in its acidity, the hops delightfully spicy and the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting, a long time favorite and one I look forward to each year, also had it on tap at Papago a few days ago, both are excellent ways to sample this great Winter Warmer  (2003) Release What a thrill it was to stop by my most favorite watering hole Papago Brewery and to find on the shelf this years release of this stupendous beer.  Once it departed its tomb (bottle), and filled my glass, I simply marveled at its wonderful translucent burnished copper color, the head a large crown of creamy tan, and as it slowly fades in to oblivion the lace becomes a thin curtain to seal off the glass. Hop floral aroma reaches your first, followed by the citrus like crispness, then the sweet malt backing ends this fantastic nose, start is malt laden and sweet, the top moderate in its feel to the palate. Hops are persistent in their spicy bite and the carbonation pleasing with the aftertaste dry and lingering. Being the Beer Pig that I am, I bought all they had tee hee, tee hee arent I mean?  (2002) Release: The beer pours a translucent deep copper color with a magnanimous head and thick clinging sheets of lace. Hop floral tones at the front and the malt underlying also citrus crisp and fresh, ah that nose. Front malt and lightly sweet, the top middling and the finish moderately carbonated with a special hop spicy bite that makes this a great IPA. The aftertaste dry and lingering and I have a case now aging away, yummy for the tummy.  (2001) Release: Pours a lightly hazy deep amber to copper color, the head is frothy, mountainous, the lace in thick sheets that cling to the glass till the very end. Nose is hop floral, malt takes second fiddle, quite ""Sniffable"". Front is malt, lightly sweet, top is moderate, the finish is magnificently hopped, potently acidic, the dry long lasting mouth feel, adds much to this beer.

140,1904,WetCoaster,3.95,"-2004 release  Well, I was hoping this Celebration would be celebrating Kerry's victory, but no such luck. Hopefully this ""sinful site"" will still be here four years from now...  Appearance: Deep, clear amber with a tall, dense, slightly tan head. Great retention. Bright, fine carbonation. Decent lace and collar.  Smell: Hops. Citrus, pine, spice, pepper, floral. There may be some malt trying to break through, but it's going to have to try a bit harder.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, slightly creamy, medium carbonation--nothing special. The malt does make a guest appearance in the flavor, but the hops are the star, no question. Big, booming and oily. White pepper and citrus rind linger long into the finish.  Drinkability: Fine, but nothing special at this point, anyway. It's a straightforward west coast IPA that's perfectly adaquate, but also perfectly average, which makes the feverish praise a bit baffling.  Maybe cellaring will make this one a star, but right now it's a fourth-round draft pick.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,taez555,4.85,"This beer poured a slightly yellowish tan/white head with a beautiful ruby brown/tan body.  The nose was a sharp crisp citrus spike with an almost woody touch. Rich malt and a slight floral note make the nose extremely inviting.  The taste was full bodied with a rich caramel malt taste. Huge citrus, pine needle and black pepper hop taste. An over the top bitterness that somehow isnt distracting at all. The malt perfectly matches the bitterness. The bitterness itself lingers but is not a palette killer by any means.  So simple, yet so amazing. Not a desert beer like the Bigfoot or a session beer like the standard pale ale, this one sort of falls in between. Simply amazing. Every year I think to myself I should buy a few cases of this to just have around all year round.  One a side note, I review the 04, but shortly after tasted an 03 Id been saving since the past year. The year old celebration was just as good, but slightly more subdued and a little more balance, sort of like a fine wine. A different experience with aging, no better no worse, just different. I highly recommend both ways.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Pours a deep auburn color with a frothy tan head and thick lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell was grapefruit, pine and caramel. The taste is heavy on the pine cones with some sharp lemon/lime rinds with just a hint of sweet maltiness bringing up the rear. The carbonation was sparkling and the mouthfeel with bright and clean with a VERY dry finish. Man, this is hoppy (moreso than last year?). Overall, the drinkability factor is pretty high even with the dry finish and warming alchohol kick. I know that this ages really nicely so I look forward to a month or two of aging. Top notch Hops for the cold winter months.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Skidz,4.48,"Pours out a light brown/orange and sits a deep cherrywood in the glass with a large off-white head. Nice lacings all over the glass. When finished, the glass has become white with head stuck all over.  Smells nice and toasty with a good dosing of hops. Light citric aroma of grapefruit and orange zest. Malts are deep within and work well underneath. Hint of pine in the back of the nose.  Flavor is off with a rush of pine cones and heavy doses of grapfruit and lime. It's all hops, all the time. Malty sweetness is there, but hard to pull out. Toasted malts come out the most. Finish is bitter and loaded with hop cones. Lingering flavor of grapefruit rinds, leaving their oils all over the back of your mouth and throat.  Crisp and clean in the mouth with sparkling carbonation. Medium body and full of life.

140,1904,bigbelcher,4.12,"Yahoo, Another year where Sierra Nevada has done it right. I just had a bottle of this years Celebration Ale. Hopheads will love this one. Aroma was pure hoppiness. Not overpowering like some Double IPA's but much better than your average IPA. I also liked the fact that even though you could tell it had some cascade hops in it they used other hops to give it a better flavor than just cascade only. Color was a nice light amber color. Head was good and full. I'm looking forward to the draft version now also.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,longarm,3.11,"2004 edition: Appearance is clear amber with fluffy pillows of foam. Generally a fine looking beer. The aroma is held captive by piney hops, but there are subtle elements of biscuit malt. A slight dose of alcoholic odors rests underneath everything else. The smell of alcohol gets stronger as the beer warms. Flavor has strong hop bitterness with a harsh finish and aftertaste. Strong piney flavors remind me of my least favorite hops, but maybe they just overhopped in general. I like the toasted malt that's in there, but it could use a lot more to achieve a sense of malt-hop balance. Some spices are in there, but the bitterness of the hops blasts them off the palate, and I can't tell what spices are actually there. The mouthfeel is decent. I like hops, but overall this beer was just out-of-balance. Maybe the harshness mellows with age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smelled of very strong floral and earthy hops with a hint of citrusy sweetness.  First taste is immediatly a very crisp strong hop prescence. After a few more swallows a nice spicy maltiness becomes more pronounced with some nice Citrus, cinamon, and ginger flavors peaking through. Still slightly dominated by the high degree of hops, but very good.  Mouthfeel is very good, a slight tingling of the taste buds coming of the spices. Plus very warming a crisp.  Great Drinkability.

140,1904,scaaven,4.8,"I'm not a seasoned beer connoisseur, but I must say, this beer is excellent. It's a little hard to track down, but I knew Liquor Mart in Boulder, CO would have it... they have everything. This is the 2004 brew, and there are so many spices and nuances, your senses are provided with quality stimuli. Beer was purchased at 6.99 a six pack, and judging by the review on this site, i was happy to pay. I think Sierra nevada has a tendancy to have more carbonation than neccesary, but I thought this beer had a nice compromise. Poured a deep red/brown color. Looks like some yeast still remain, so not quite filtered as it's Pale Ale brother. It's more filling than Pale ale I can tell you that much. The taste was very complex and I felt the holiday ""spirits"" immediatly. I'm not experienced enough to know what specific ingredients and what processes produce a specific taste, but I can say that Celebration Ale tastes like an evening in a cabin during the dead of winter with the fire blazing and you snuggled up under a warm semi-stiff blanket. For being a 6.8% beer, you hardly taste the alcohol. Some beers rely on that alcohol taste to ""flavor"" the beer, but not this one. They've taken quality ingredients to almost exactly compliment any alcohol. Thanks Sierra Nevada for a quality brew!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dgallina,2.83,"2004 vintage on-draft. Pours a very attractive clear golden copper color with a good, persistent head and substantial lacing. Enticing hop flower aromas. Strong hop oil flavors which finish with extremely potent and almost metallic hop bitterness. This vintage was far too hoppy for my taste. While the hop flower smell and flavors are interesting, they are ultimately overwhelmed by the hop bitterness and overpowering after-tastes. I found it very difficult to finish my pint.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The appearance is absolutely gorgeuos with a sticky head and ruby read body. The aroma is typical Sierra Nevada on both years, but the 2004 has a lot bigger ""Kick in the face"" hop trait. The 04 had a very strong grapefuit as the 03 had a milder citrus smell. Now for the taste. The 04 seems extremely fresh and chock-full-of-hoppiness delight. The 03 has a much drier and weaker hop presence. I must add that the 2003's head is much more sticky and the lacing is out of this world compared to the 2004. The mouthfeel is great on both years although the 03 is much more enjoyable. This is truly a fine specimin for an IPA and I look forward to it each year. I had to, of course, buy a case of the 04. I will be cellaring a six pack for future years. I agree with others that this beer is much better after taking a nap for a year or so in a dark basement! The 2004 was just a little too fresh; if that is even possible or a bad thing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GClarkage,4.59,"Consumed in October 2004 at the Toronado on tap. Was the first time I have ever had a Celebration before. I've seen so many people rave about; so I figure why not have it from the tap for the first time. Poured with a decent head and left little lace while drinking through the pint. Smells of flowers, fruits and hops come out in the nose. Tastes of the exact smells. More hops that I expected. I was thinking there would be a heavier alcohol taste aproaching a weak style barleywine. A nice carbonated and crisp beer. Very drinkable. It still wasn't as good as I thought it would be though. Maybe because I thought it was a different style. Still a good-very good beer worth picking up.  Update 2003 version-  Tastes pretty much the same except maybe a slight bit less hops. Still an excellent beer. I have had several samples of the 2004 and now that I know what to expect, I think I will change my original rating. This is a very class beer.  Update 2005 version-  Finding myself now drooling over this beer. Purchased a case of the 2005 from Costco for about $24. This years seems very hoppy with a big pine or woodsy flavor to the hops. Almost feel like raising drinkability to a 5. Already looking to buy another case to get me by until 2006.  Update 2006 version-  This version is as good as it always is. Seems even more like a traditional IPA this year. Plenty of hops and a nice caramel malt base. Very well balanced.  Update 2007 version-  Again, a winner. Maybe one of the best yet. Of the three bottles I've had, they seem more sweet, but maybe not quite a hopped up. Compare this years version to Lost Coast Indica. Very good as usual.  Update 2008 version-  Seems to bit a bit more malty this year. Still very good, but I've enjoyed all the past years a bit more. Still won't stop me from buying a case each year...and from drinking the rest of this years stash. Still an above average IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,allengarvin,4.02,"Bottle of 2004, just available here.  Appearance: Reddish-mahogany, clear, with a slight head.  Aroma: Citrus, flowery aroma.  Flavor: Hops hops and more hops. Floral and, er, maybe grapefruit-like fruitiness is how the hops taste to me this year. If you concentrate on looking beyond the hops, there's some sweet malt back there, but it's not real prominent. Bitterness lingers for a long time after the finish.  I've been a fan of this beer for a long time. In my beer-label books, the earliest Celebration Ale label I have is from 1993. But I think it tastes best when it ages for at least a year, preferably two. The aroma disappears, but the malt really blossoms forward, making a wondeful balance.  Unfortunately, I forgot to buy any last year, and I have no more cellared C.A. left. Fresh, it's just too bitter to be interesting.

Smell - a variety of spices accompany a strong hop aroma. Not citrusy like amy local hoppy brews, but just a nice slightly sweet sharp and moderately bitter scent.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Yummy. It's kinda thick and fills the back of my throat. It has a lot of hops but they are nicely balanced with a malty flavor and a spicy taste. No specific spices stick out, but it's a sort of nutmeg/cinnamony blend. It is quite enjoyable and warming. Bit toasty tasting too.

Initial flavors start of very hoppy with a piney resinous like flavor. The mood of this beer quickly changes over with a nice creamy malt backing that portrays a bit of biscuit and just a hint of caramel. This brew progresses back to the hops thereafter, giving off a slight crisp bitterness followed by some juicy citrusy flavors that just linger on the tongue sip after sip after sip.

The nose on this one is upfront with citrusy grapefruity hops along with some caramel and roasted nuts. It's fun to smell.  The first taste is a blast of fresh hops...citrus and light floral tones intertwine and float atop a caramel nutty malt background. The hops run the show here and you don't hear me complaining. My case was bottled just a month ago and it shows. An extremely tasty, enjoyable treat.  Mouthfeel is lush and creamy with good carbonation. Smooth and satisfying.

Nice and malty with a hoppy bite and virtually no trace of alcohol until it hits your throat, nice aftertaste as well.

The taste of this beer is very challanging. I like a good challenge. The hops are so present the beer stings your tongue and bites you in the back of the mouth. Intense. You have to swallow the beer fast and evade the taste bud hop attack to even pick up on the maltyness. But that's ok, I don't think this beer was intended to be well balanced in that respect, it's just a hop extravaganza. Very bitter finish as well.

Some good bitterness lingers on the palate for a while. Finishes with some grapefruit/orange flavors and lasts into the aftertaste.

Tastes a little raw to me, with the standard oily mouthfeel on a long finish. (gotta love the hop burps, though...)

140,1904,ngandhi,4.23,"2002 Vintage  Without looking at my review on the 03 Vintage, I scored the 02 exactly the same across the board.  Rosey and tropical from clear Centennials and Cascades. Moderate carbonation made soft by heavy caramel malt. Light residual sweetness brings out a dynamic citrus that truly brings this beer together. Piney finish with nutty grain. Jell-O juicy. No astringency. The floral hops thin to one-dimensional pine. Viscous malts is a touch too gummy.  Relax, relax. ng  2003 Vintage  The sharp bitterness in Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale is cut by classic West Coast fruity/floral flavor hopping; I get notes of Centennial and Cascade with definite Cascade dry-hopping. There's too much body for an IPA, but it's cut by good carbonation that lightens the mouthfeel and intensifies the hop profile.  Either IPAs have gotten too floral, too much like pale ales, or SNCA is too close to a barleywine. My first impulse on this brew was to call it an I2PA or a barleywine. Though the bittering is only (ha!) 62 IBUs, on the light side of barleywine, the Chinook character is very pronounced and something immediately reminiscent of Rogue Old Crustacean. Sitting here today, it's a wonder than OC has twice the bittering of this beer.  The finish is long and bitter, fading into some floral and grapefruit character from the Centennials and Cascades. SNCA screams of its hops and is a perfect indication of what Centennials, Cascades, and Chinooks taste like all at once. What more can you ask from an IPA?

Celebration Ale pours a nice amber-red color with a inch or so lofty off white head. Give it a few minutes and the fluff settles to a nice lumpy top, like a pancake before you flip it over. There is a strong smell of hops. Held up to the light, you can see abundant flecks of what I would guess are spices suspended in the brew. No sediment though. The first taste is...hops. Did I just eat a Cascade salad? Progressive sips seem more subdued. There is decent carmel malt that is pretty much covered by spice. I'd guess the standard winter spice mix most places use: clove, allspice, cinammon. It's not really balanced. The hops bite, then the spices give an artifical lengthing of the hop bitterness. Not as sweet and rich as I think a winter seasonal would be. I guess its an IPA first, a seasonal second. Mouthfeel is good. Not heavy and cloying, but with enough oomph behind it to let you know you're drinking a beer. Drinkability is good. I could easily have a bunch of these. I like this beer. I do. I'm just not sure it deserves such high ratings. If anything, it's well known and widely distributed. Almost as much as SNPA. I'm glad to try it about once a season, see if anything has really changed. Good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Popsinc,4.07,"A very nice clear, amber pour with quite a generous pancake head. The nose is nicely hopped and has plenty of fruitiness kickin around as well...peach and apricot i'd have to say. The taste is big and hoppy right off the bat with underlying fruitiness and a nice malt backbone. Underlying caramel sweetness. This beer offers bold, up front taste and well balanced body. A very, very light and smooth mouthfeel make this one an easy drinker...dangerous with the 6.8% abv. The finish is of a lovely hop bitterness as the light fruity notes disapate towards the end. Great stuff!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SilentSabre,2.86,"poured a copper like reddish brown with little head. Sweet smell with some spice and a bit chocolate. Alot of spice in the taste, but had a bit of bitterness to it as well. Had a little more carbonation than I was expecting but not too bad. No exactly something to write home about. Not totally awful, but not really impressed, either.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MrNuggets,4.4,Burnt orange colour with a finger high off-white head. The beautiful lace elegantly wraps around my glass. Smells of citrus and hops. I get that a hint of citrus in the taste. Then I'm slammed with that lovely hop bitterness I expect from a good IPA. Finishes off nice and bitter. Very full mouthfeel. This is my first celebration and i will certainly be getting more season.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Jacobier10,3.85,"Wow, this beer has some HUGE flavor. It pours a deep orange with a small head but plenty of carbonation. It smells somewhat fruity. The taste is strong though. I can taste some orange and cinnamon with a slight taste of alcohol. A very filling beer that would be difficult to finish a six pack of. The hops really stand out here. Tons of flavor. This beer knocked me on my ass, but in a good way!  [Re-review]  I have become wiser since my last review, so I thought I'd a few more comments. HUGE floral aroma and taste. This is one balls-to-the-wall IPA. I've bumped up my ratings a little bit after trying this again a year later. Definitely worth a try for yourself, but it still does knock me on my ass!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Hagbard,4.38,"Pours a dark honey color with a nice-sized beige head. Leaves a great lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is not overpowering, but what is there is beautiful hop bitterness. The aroma is a great precursor to the blast of hops bitterness that assaults the back of your tongue. An IPA through and through. A faint fruity taste teases your tongue in the background, amazing considering the strength of the hops. The aftertaste is more of the same, leading into happy hoppy burps that let you relive the experience. The mouthfeel is heavy due ot the carbonation bombarding the sides of your mouth. This is immensely drinkable. The pint is gone almost before you realize it. I love this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ybnorml,3.74,This is the 2003 version. It has a cloudy orange amber color. Large bubbles in the head that leave a little bit of lace. An absolutely fantastic spicey and floral hop boquet. The flavor on the other hand did not give me the same hop jump. There was a hop bitterness followed by not a grapfruit citrus but more of a lemony citrus. Lemony like the finish to a lemon ice tea. I don't know if the cloudness in the beer was responsible for the muted finish to the flavor or not. I guess I will just have to wait to next year and try it as soon as it comes out.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,canoehornpoint,4.85,"Pours a nice, clear medium amber brown with off white lacy head that held the sides like a champ and lasted a pretty good time. Aroma of maltiness, citrus, spice and floral hop. The taste of grapefruit citrus hop is very pronounced with a hint of maltiness in the background balancing this out. It has a relatively light mouthfeel with a nice hop bite at the end that makes you want more and more. Very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HappyHourHero,3.95,"2003  Poured a fluffy oatmeal brown colored head left a coat of lace as it faded to a film. Light mahoganny colored beer with a steady stream of bubbles rising from the center of the chalice. Potent piney hop aroma. Wow, only two years ago this beer was the most bitter IPA I could handle. Piney grapefruit hop flavor sits atop a solid malt base. The finish is mildly bitter, solid for an IPA. A staple IPA, nice raw hop character.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Zorro,4.7,"Pours a very mildly cloudy Bronze color.  Smell is sharply hoppy, as an IPA should be. Malt doesn't get overpowered by the hops and shows up. Also has a fruity scent to it.  Taste is sharp hop, and malt, and fruit and spice; all that in the first sip! All the flavors dance on your tongue as you continue to drink it. This is some good stuff.  Mouthfeel is quite thick for its style.  Very drinkable, I also know where there are 4 more six packs of this stuff are.

Each sip finishes with a appetizing bitterness that leaves you wanting another.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Nytemare,4.3,"Another beer in my ""honey, we got our tax return, let's each get fifty to blow and put the rest in the bank,"" beer. Poured a reddish gold color with a slightly off white fluffy head. Some lacing. Smelled hoppy, imagine that. Cascade mostly if I'm beginning to learn this stuff. Quite tasty. Very hoppy, but not as hoppy as I was expecting. Less of a hops assault more attention to detail. Decent mouthfeel, moderate body with good carbonation. A little oily, but that rarely detracts. Definately drinkable. I can't have more than one in a sitting, but will definately look forward to this each year. My one downside, as it warmed, the alcohol became rather obvious and overpowering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,sulldaddy,3.98,"I am sampling this brew at room temp. I pour the beer into my pint glass and its color is clear orangish amber with some light sediment. This is the 2003 version by the way. I get a soft fluffy off-white head that foams up easily. Aroma is rich piney hops with some light spices. The first sip gives me, an average body and medium carbonation, oh yea and lots of hops! I get a brief sweet caramel hit up front and then hops roll in. SOme pine and some sour grapefruit. A little oily and chewy with a drying finish. This is a nice and smooth brew that is not overwhelmingly hoppy. Very nice to drink!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BuckeyeNation,4.35,"I've had two of these in my beer fridge since November and have somehow managed to resist them. I've been reading about how hoppiness decreases over time, which probably means (since I'm of the 'hoppier the better' school) that I should have had them as fresh as possible. Anyway, I'm about to remedy that oversight tonight.  Medium orange-amber with a moderate haze. The head is very large and is dark cream edging into ecru. Stiff and rocky, then lumpy, it sticks in chunks to the inside of the pint glass. It looks for all the world like a thick, frothy milkshake. Ultimately there are chunky rings of lace on the glass and a thick, lumpy film on top of the beer.  The nose is primarily grapefruit peel-like. Upon tasting, a soft (yet insistent) wave of hops hits the taste buds. Several varieties are probably present and I'm betting that Cascade is among them. The hoppiness is primarily citrusy and floral, with a hint of pine. There is also a background spiciness that becomes more noticeable as the beer warms.  There's a fairly large malt load as well. Alcohol is noted, especially after the initial wave of hops subsides (alcohol is almost undetectable in the 2007 Celebration). The finish is long, decently hoppy and ultimately dry. The body/mouthfeel is creamy and is reasonably full.  There's no question that Celebration Ale is an excellent IPA. It doesn't get extraordinarily high marks from me, however, because the hops aren't quite prominent enough. I know that this isn't a DIPA and that it would undoubtedly have been hoppier if I had drunk it sooner after bottling, but even so...  If you love IPAs that are hoppy with a nod toward balance, then start the Celebration early. Next year I'll crack open my first one on the day I buy it.  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  I never drank 2005 Celebration Ale, thought 2006 Celebration was more maibock-like than IPA-like (woefully underhopped) and just enjoyed the hell out of a bottle 2007 Celebration a few hours ago. (re-reviewed 12/29/07)  When done right, this is clearly an expertly brewed ale. The malt backbone was nice and sturdy (mostly pale with a hint of caramel) and the citric hops were right up front where they belong. I was equally impressed with one of the smoothest, creamiest mouthfeels that I've experienced in a beer of this style in quite some time. So *this* is what Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale is supposed to taste like!  scores for 2004: 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0... ... 4.15 scores for 2007: 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5... ... 4.3",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,FFudnam,4.35,"Sampled at home  I must have left it in the freezer a few minutes too many, as the beer has frozen near the point of the bottle. Nothing adverse is noted as a result, however.  Pours cleanly into my glass, a creamy tan head one finger tall arises from the creation. Excellent looking pale ale. A hazy gold-copper liquid which has presence in the glass. The head fades to a minimum.  Nose of lovely spicy/fruity cascade hops, sweet malt, and light/fruity alcohol notes. Similar to Two-Hearted, but less floral.  Taste is hops in front, for sure. A spicy rendition of the familiar cascade hop is apparent, but ultimately gives way to the expected citrus character. More sweet malt, some light yeast notes, and a clean bitterness that doesn't linger too long. Warms the belly.  All in all, a wonderful brew which should be done year-round, much like Bell's has wisely decided to do. Can't wait to find some more!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,rajendra82,5,"I am blown away. Pours out with a dark amber orange body and an extra tall beige head that is creamy and smooth. One of the loveliest display of carbonation I've ever seen in a beer. There is a near constant stream of tiny bubbles rushing to the top the entire time I drink this beer. The aroma is pure hops with citrus, pine, spruce, and spices in every whiff. Body is medium with an appropriate mouthfeel enhanced by the tiny bubbles that coat your tongue as the beer warms in your mouth. Bitter hoppy taste is a delightful departure from the sweet and syrupy winter fare from others. Malt backbone is solid and creamy, but hops are front, center, and back. Many thanks go to nvsblman for this trade. Hopefully next year this beer will be on the shelves in Georgia. When I see it in the stores, I'm going to be celebrating for sure.   Update:  It is now fall of 2004 and by the grace of God, HB 645 is now the law of the land in the State of Georgia. I just picked up a Sierra Nevada Celebration off the shelf from Green's. When pouring it in the glass I notice something that was missing last year. This year's version is cloudy. The bottle conditioned release is much less bubbly than the force carbonated 2003 version. The mouthfeel also seems more soft this year, and the spiciness has gone down a notch. Still a classic IPA.   Update 2:  Got a 2003 bottle as part of Cellar Meat BIF 18 from pentathlete. After a year and a half, the hops had faded, and the beer could be considered balanced. The taste had taken on shades of an Old Ale at this age, with some chewy sweet malt. The hops lurked in the back as a peppery wispy presence. I much prefer the assertive fresh taste, but still much to like here.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,stewart124,4.83,2003 Celebration I bought this case before Christmas and let this bottle sit a few months until ready posts about how the hops fade. I didn't want that to happen to my precious.  Pours a beautifully rich amber color with a huge fluffy head and even prettier lacing. Smells a very floral aroma and hints of citrus. The taste is even better then I remember with a great big bite of hops and a creamy malt character. Notes of caramel and a slight pine taste. This truley is a taste explosion! One of the reasons I look forward to the holiday season. It doesn't get much better than this.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Also some florals and citrus aroma come through. Taste is very hoppy but not off the wall. Good malt taste upfront and a strong, but pleasing bitterness in the end. Also, slight coffee notes in the aftertaste if you look hard. Im not a big fan of IPA's but this one is pretty good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The snowy cabin on the label gives a feeling that if I was snowed in with this beer, life would be good. Pours a amber/reddish liquid with a great off-white foamy head. The head stayed around for quite some time. Great lace around the glass as time wore on. Smells of citrus, almost spicy. No mistake about it, this is going to be hoppy. The taste is as good as it gets. Hints of a sweet malt surrounded and overtaken by citrusy hops. Plenty of Cascades in this one. This is a hophead's delight. Great medium body. This may not be exactly be a session beer, but since it is a seasonal, make it one!

140,1904,UnionMade,4.8,"The beer is a bright orangey amber, almost a maroonish hue. Excellent clarity. A thick, creamy white head rests atop, keeping a tight foam through the entire pint, barely diminishing at all. Incredible. Rings of belgian lace coat the glass. This is one drop-dead gorgeous brew! The aroma is replete with pacific northwest goodness. Loads of hops, providing an oily, rind-like grapefruity citric aroma. Definite cascade, with some other citric varieties I can't place, maybe columbus or centennial. A bit of herbal mellowness. Plentiful malt hoists the hopping, balancing it on the tip of a finger. Soft toasty crystal malt aroma, with a touch of biscuitiness. Relatively clean, like all their beers. If you love hops, this is it. The flavor starts with a solid toasty maltiness right up front, followed quickly by a rather powerful hop flavor. Very oily, with grapefruit rind citus and floral flavor. Clean, with perhaps a touch of floral esters. The citric hopping continues into the finish, where it picks up a bit of soft herbal quality. A pleasantl snappy bitterness in the finish, with some biscuity malt breaking through. A very clean, raw hoppiness, almost astringent in it's potency. Good hoppy burps, with an oily citric flavor lingering on the back of the tongue for centuries. Full bodied, with easy going carbonation. One of the beers I look forward to all year, and squirrel a few away for spring. Easily one of the best IPAs in the world. A standard for west coast IPA. Great from the bottle, but absolutely stunning on tap. The hops are incredibly fresh.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JackTheRipper,4.25,"When I took my first sip of this, I was expecting a winter seasonal, not an India Pale ale, so I had to redo my numbers with that in mind.  Appearance: Medium amber color, big sticky off white head..  Smell: Grapefruity hop smell. a touch of ginger (?) is also smelled.  Taste: Smooth hoppy goodness. Long finish, nice balance.  Mouthfeel: Nice and sharp but smooth at the same time, alcohol is well masked. CO2 level is spot on.  Drinkability: For an IPA, this is a pretty wonderful brew. Once it has had a chance to warm just a bit, the flavors become more complex, and it smoothes out just a bit. Nicely done.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kwalters,3.82,"2003 Vintage: After reading the glowing reviews, this bottle came highly anticipated. Celebration is a deep amber/orange color with a medium sized head. The smell is obviously hoppy, but also spicy and a bit piney.  Celebration is immediately recognizable as SNPA's big brother. The hop taste is more intense and there is a noticable amount of dry bitterness. In fact, the bitterness and dryness were a bit too much for my tastes. I prefer more citrus notes such as those found in Kalamazoo's Two-Hearted Ale.  There's plenty of flavor and character here to satisfy any American pale ale or IPA fanatic. It's relatively cheap too, for a 6.8% well made IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,malty,4,"Vintage 2003. 12 oz. traditional bottle with the customary cozy winter scene.  Bronze-orange with nice clarity. Fluffy off-white head that has staying power.  Brilliant hop nose with an interesting earthy scent that makes you wonder what's behind those perky hops.  Ahhh, there it is. Refreshing hops are right up-front with a nice backdrop of malt that keeps it held together nicely. Also hints of pine, faint cinnamon and even vanilla, (but very subtle). I enjoyed the many dimensions of this med. bodied seasonal offering. It's definitely got more going on in the taste dept. than one might expect. I even detected a hint of cinnamon in the long and flavorful finish.  Mouthfeel is viscous, with the essential curl of the tongue you get with any well hopped ale. Fine carbonation which keeps things moving along nicely.  One of the more highly drinkable holiday ales you might find. A hop head's delight with something there for the malt maestros as well.  A must have for the holidays. I enjoyed this vintage more than the last couple due to it's slight chewy malt characteristics.

140,1904,Chsyhkr,3.16,"Ah, Celebration Ale, one would think of a nice winter warner, not!  A nice beer for hopheads, but too typical of overdone west coast hopped beers.  Really a nice IPA and not much more. A full gold color and strong hop presence, bordering on insipid. Some malt in the aroma and taste, but you know what we are getting here. HOPS!  A fairly dry beer, not unusual for an IPA with a clean finish, if you consider ripping your tastbuds out with pliers clean.  Hey, it's a good beer but not a ""winter celebration"" type ale.

140,1904,Beastdog75,3.8,"(2003 Edition)  Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale is one of the most anticipated beers of the winter season. While other brewers may offer a holiday brew that contains fruits, spices and whatnot SN gives us quite simply a very hoppy IPA that is bold, interesting, and complex.  Celebration Ale pours a nice reddish amber color with a nice foamy head that retains well and leaves decent lacing. Of course, the predominant aroma in this beer is hops. Aroma contains notes of pine, floralness, herbs, and the slightest hint of sweet caramel malts. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly coating, with a moderate carbonation. The hop flavors jump out immediately in this beer. A strong pine and woody character seem to be the main players in the flavor department. Other notes include herbs, citrus, mintiness, and spiciness. A very slight malt profile was detected under the hops, but to my inexperienced palette it was barely detectable. The beer is quite bitter in the finish. The hop flavors linger well after the beer is finished, and is quite drying as well. There is some alcoholic warmth in the finish, but not nearly as much as you'd expect from a beer that nears 7% abv.  I'm not a card carrying member of the Hophead Society yet, but if I were this beer would probably get an even better score from me. I really didn't find this beer to be all that balanced, but the fact that it is so well-brewed and interesting atones for that. I will eventually acclimate myself to this style, so that when next winter rolls around, I will be ready to accept the onslaught of the Celebration Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,twilight,4.63,"I've had this before, but I now realize the taste of other beers had influenced its flavor. So I'm reviewing it with a neutral palate. 2003 edition, 12 oz. bottle in nonick pint glass.  Beautiful bronze colour, with a ring of head around the outside that leaves beautiful lacing around the glass. The smell is a subtle and beautiful scent of hops, almost as though you were walking through a field of hops, but not overpowering. Taste is heavenly. Major hop taste without being too bitter or acrid. Perfectly balanced with malts. Neither sweet nor sour, but just inbetween. A delicately balanced beer. The other surprise about Celebration is that it goes down super smooth. Aftertaste is pure hops without being overly bitter. Just that nice smooth bitterness. All around an exceptional beer. Too bad I got the last sixer from the beer store. It's a crime to have this beer be only seasonal. But then again I suppose one will appreciate it better.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mrpicklerelish,4.63,"Apperance- This one poured a nice orangish copper color. The head was a nice light tan color that seemed to pretty much stick around the entire time that I drank it. Or maybe I just drank it a little to fast because of how great it tasted.  Smell- I smelt a floral and ctirus smell right off the bat. Along with a hint of herbs and spices.  Taste- A very nice hoppy IPA, one of the best that I have had. While strong on hops, it tasted very smooth and went down even smoother. There was also a glimps of malt which left a nice sweeteness in my mouth.  Mouthfeel- Despite the massive hops in this brew, it seemed to go very smoothly. Not a crisp beer by any means, but not to heavy either, just right.  Drinkability- Not a session beer do to the 6.8% ABV. But I will say, everytime I run into this brew I must pick up at least a six pack.  Comments- Wow, my first time with this beer and it sure made the last part of 2003 and the beginning of 2004 a blast. When I can no longer get this very special seasonal brew it will be a sad day. But it will sure give me something to look forward to next winter.

140,1904,RockyTopHeel,4.46,"2003 Edition.  Now this is a beautiful looking beer. Vibrant, glowing, even sparkling amber-colored with lots of bubbling carbonation and a pocked beige head. I mean, this really glows in the glass. Gorgeous--and I haven't even tasted it yet.  Bright, hoppy aroma fits with the appearance, with light sweetnesses at the corners. The taste starts clean, crisp and hoppy, then flows seamlessly into a softer, slightly malty finish with small explosions of sweeter flavors and fruit notes. On top of all that, this beer is ridiculously drinkable, too. Amazing.  Now I know what all the fuss is about. Wow.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,IceAce,4.23,"APPEARANCE: Medium Copper color with excellent clarity. Arrived with less than 1 finger of foam head but had already decorated the brim of the Libbey straight-side pint glass with an excellent sticky lace.  SMELL: Don't mean to 'dis this ale. but the collar of foam disppointed by dissapating rapidly leaving behind a disappointed taster. Thus, the quality and quantity of the aroma were slightly lacking behind the lofty expectations.  TASTE: First taste of this big brew was dominated by the aggressive hopping. Subsequent tastings provided glimpses into multiple malts...always followed by (very) sticky hops. ~ (Appearance update) Halfway through the pint the lacing on the glass is picture perfect...thus deepening the mystery of the disappearing head. (We'll blame this on the glasswasher)  MOUTHFEEL: Mouthfeel is exceptional as the tongue is simultaneously tangoing with malts, waltzing with hops, and doing the jitterbug with the just-right level of CO².  DRINKABILITY: All winter long, baby!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,KingSlender,3.83,"This is one of those beers that you wish was brewed year round. I always make sure I stock up on Celebration when it arrives each winter. Celebration has a very pleasing nose that reminds me of most holiday brews - a buffet of unique spices, fruits, and hops. The appearance is a deep amber hue with a remarkable light brown head. At first sip your tastebuds jump for joy as the complex, but smooth, structure falls down the back of your tongue. A perfect combination of hops and malt. This is one of Sierra Nevada's jewels and should be enjoyed all winter long.  The King recommends drinking this beer with a slice of Mom's home-made rhubarb pie.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PartyHatjo,4.03,"I've tried this both in the bottle and on tap, but I prefer the draught version. The head didn't last particularly long, but I didn't particularly care as this beer wasn't undelicious. The hop aroma is groin-grabbingly transcendent and being a hophead, I can't get enough of it. The bitterness is present but is balanced nicely with the malts. I love cascades (who doesn't?) and the citrusy characteristic of them is strong, and it helps to mask any alcohol flavor. Definitely the best IPA I've had that I didn't make myself...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MobBarley,4.87,"This brew knocks my socks off. Poured from a nostalgic looking 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Above average, off-white head that persisted through the drink. And the color, oh the color! Beautiful and coppery with a festive reddish hue...quite fetching.  The smell of this sample was fresh bread up front, quickly moving into a crescendo of hoppy citrus notes before a final, mellow note of holiday spice.  Hops dominate here and for me that is usually sufficient. This ale is more complex than most, however. This has a strong, malty foundation that imparts slight (butterscotch?) notes and is a worthy counterpart to a truly delicious hoppy/spicy finish with big notes of yellow grapefruit.  Smooth and perfectly carbonated in the mouth. Teases the tongue all over, and is all at once refreshing and substantial.  The drinkability here is almost worthy of a 5.0, but the high ABV makes it a beer better served with a good, spicy meal. Not a session beer, but a special beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HiroProtagonist,4.25,"Celebration 2003 poured with a small rough light tan head, and left nice fine lacing. The color was a very beautiful molten and glowing copper. The smell was mellow yet quite complex, with a lovely floral hop bouquet and a sublte malty notes. The taste was rich and delicious, with a superb whole grain malt backbone and perfectly matched assertive bitter finish. The beer felt amazingly full and velvety. This beer is quite an accomplishment. It is rich, dimensional, and hoppy, has a mouthfeel of a more expensive big beer, and yet costs the same as the other ""standard"" microbrews. A winner!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Boto,4.35,"12oz. Bottle: This is a winter beer. It pours quite dark, with a tinge of red to it. The aroma is quite good, with aromas of citrus hops, malts, spices, floral notes, and quite possible some others. There is a full, rich taste with quite a nice hop kick to it. A very well balanced beer. Very, very good!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,xgrigorix,4.13,"Twelve ounce brown twist cap bottle - 2003 edition.  Bright copper hue, clear, with slow moving carbonation. Medium sized bubbles. Rocky, beige coloured head retains well, & leaves a thin sheet of lace behind.  Big, robust, hop loaded nose. Scents of pine, orange, & caramel.  A quick hop attack, gives way to a big round caramel powered malt flavour. Some toasted flavours make it a little more interesting. A sharp bitter whack heralds in orange & pine, with the pine flavour really popping after the swallow. Dry finish, medium body, easy carbonation. A winter classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,oelergud,4.23,"-2003... Very nice ruby body with a pure white head, rich carbonation and a cozy christmas like scenery on the label. Smell is clearly dominated by hops and spices along with some subtle bread and grain like aromas. Taste is much like the smell, some faint malt flavors can be detected if you look for them. There is more spice in the flavor than in the nose and a nice lingering hoppy aftertaste. Feels full and sturdy but doesn't leave any slickness in your mouth. Pretty good drinkability.  I've only had a few IPAs but this is by far the hoppiest of them all and doesn't seem consistent with the rest which I assume represent the style. So I guess this brew doesn't live up to the style as much as others, however is does taste pretty good so I'll let style be style and judge based on how I like it anyway.  -Oelergud",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,LuckySevens82,4.25,"Now, I must preface this by saying that I am not a huge fan of IPAs then again here in FL we don't get to see many of the good ones (or at least I have yet to find one), nevertheless, knowing this, I decided to see what all the fuss was about and I picked up a 6 of the 2003 edition of this ale.  I can honestly say that I am quite impressed. From the initial pour, I could tell by the honey color and off-white head that I was in for a treat. The aroma, of citrus, hops and what to me smells like thyme, is very warming and just begs you to drink it.  First taste...Wow, this isn't what I was expecting, it's got the punch that most other IPAs that I've tasted have, but this one is balanced with a smooth texture and the flavor is amazing.  Great Beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Starchild,4.65,"I think the thing that makes this IPA so wonderful is that it doesnt taste like other IPA. No it doesnt have a high hop profile or a strong alcohol percentage, which Im used to. The beauty of this beer lies in the subtle yet complex flavor, a symphony of flavors from hops, herbs, spice to fruit. This beer has intoxicating diction, so that every ingredient complements another ingredient. Dont read this review, rather go and try some (and buy some to age).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GeoffFromSJ,4.3,"Wow. Just had the 2003 vintage. I am not an IPA person, but this was really deserving of its reputation. Let me just say it is hoppy without being overwhelming. And that really boosted its drinkability for me. The taste has more nuance than that, but what can I say? Try it for yourself. I would be completely shocked if you were disappointed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BEERBOY13323,4.33,"The holiday season offers some of the best seasonal beers. However, hands down Sierra Nevada has one of the best seasonal brews.

140,1904,TastyTaste,4.85,"12-21-03 Cranberry red colored, with an off white head. Smells of spice, fruit, and hops. Has a very nice spiced flavor, which peaks with a big shot of hops. This is a very tasty beer, it is up there with two hearted ale as my favorite. I definitely like it served at cellar temperature, a lot more flavor.  Additional Comments 11-13-04: The hops are smoothed over a lot, big initial hop kick, but that flavor does not leave you with a gigantic hop bitter aftertaste. Unique and delicious. I think I appreciate it more after a year apart.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Wildman,4.65,"On tap @Little Brothers: This beer was a reddish brown color and formed a small off white foamy head that left some nice circular lace. There was a medium amount of carbonation present. An aroma of malt, hops and citrus. A flavor of malt and strong presence of hops. A bit of a citrus aspect with a touch of spice. A bit of a bitter finish. A slightly different animal on tap in the 2003 version as compared to 2002, which I did not have the advantage of having on tap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PatandDavid,3.65,"This was the 2003 tap version...while still great, I am thinking that this would have been a bit smoother and the flavors a bit more meshed if I was drinking say a year-old version, but hey, here we go: Medium clear amber. Nice frothy head when served, but it settled down after awhile. Aromo was of a pine forest. Taste was of a meeting between the malt and the hops, with hops making it just slightly rough. Again, while drinking this, I thought, this is pretty good, but oh, it would much more enjoyable if aged! For a tap beer though, not bad, a bit rough and not really as smooth as it could be. pat",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste is a classic mixof malt, hop spiciness and bitterness. Great mouthfeel as this beer slides down your gullet after having a party with your taste buds.  I've been away from Sierra Nevada for too long. I haven't had one for probably 10 years and been way too long. This is truly a great beer. To me its almost an Imperial IPA with all the hop to it. Amazingly quaffable beer and I can only dream and imagine how good this would be on draught.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GCBrewingCo,4.22,The beer poured pale amber with a large lingering white head. The aroma is heavely with American hops and sweet malt. The flavor is bitterness up front then large American hop flavor and a dry slightly bitter finish. The malt is substantial enough to not allow the hops to overpower the brew. The body is medium and the drinkability is very good.  2003 vintage in a stubbie twisty.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Dubblebock,3.41,"I finally managed to get my hands on a sixer of this a couple of weeks ago. This was my first stab at the Celebration Ale, and I dropped $7.99 for the opportunity to try it. Interestingly enough, I had to slowly drink my way through almost the entire six-pack (I have one left) before I could get a handle on this beer. My initial impression was that it was badly out of whack. It seemed extremely unbalanced and overly harsh at first, but I began to understand the beer a little better after I had sampled it a few more times.  It's a confusing holiday brew for those who have never tried it before. It's not your traditional spiced Christmas ale. No, it's an IPA, and a big one to boot. Celebration really throws you when you first try it.  It pours great, with a big, foamy head and a slight citrus nose. It's a dark amber color in the mug, and it just looks fantastic.  The initial taste is mellow, but the hop bitters really kick in on the middle and back of the tongue. Potent, to say the least. I was really taken aback on my first try at this beer. I was not expecting the high level of bitterness at all. No malt character to speak of, this one is all hops. It felt like Santa had come down my chimney and punched me right in the mouth. POW! Merry effin' Christmas, you BA wannabe!! I felt betrayed. Celebration, indeed!  But, I couldn't abandon it. I had to keep after it, had to master it. So I tried it again, this time figuring that I knew a little more about what to expect. Better on the second try. Still bitter, but not so bad. Tried one straight from the bottle. Better yet. Actually began to get a little bit of malty warmth out of it. By the fouth one, I was ok with it and actually started to really enjoy it. I felt like the bruise that Santa had given me had healed a little, and a little bit of the ol' Celebration spirit was beginning to kick in.  Good mouthfeel, fair carbonation. Not something my palate would say is highly drinkable, but one or two at a sitting would be cool. I'll have a go at it again next year now that I know more about the beer. If you're into strong India Pale Ales, this one is for you. Don't expect much more than a hop explosion, but if that's what you like, you're in for a treat.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Realale,3.98,"Rich full copper with a decent blush of red. Very fine 1"" beige head settles slowly to a 1/4"" cap and stays, leaving nice lacing.  Nose is citric stemmy/leafy/resiny hops. Some rich bready malt pokes through as does a touch of caramel.  Medium-bodied in the mouth with some brown bread and toffee. Good hop flavor. Bit thin towards the finish when the bitterness really takes over. The bitterness is significant but very well-mannered.  Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but a higher level of carbonation would accentuate the hops too much. A pleasure to drink.  2003 Edition.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,granger10,4,"This one poured a golden copper color with a frothy white head. The smell was citrusy and hoppy. As was the taste. I noticed lots of grapefruit along with some floral hops. But the malt backbone kept the hops in check, somewhat. This was still quite hoppy but not extremely bitter. Another winner from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,counselor,4.15,"Another great offering from SN. This beer poured the color of the mosquito fossil amber cane the old guy had in Jurrasic Park. At first it smelled crisp and clean like a cold winter morning, but then the super dry hop smell kicked in to let you know what was ahead. Like the SN Pale Ale, this beer is well balanced with smooth malt flavors across the tounge, with cirtus dry hops to balance out the beer. Molasses and tannin flavors that balance out nicely. A really nice beer that carries on SN's west coast brewing tradition",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Globetrotter,4.55,"What a treat to enjoy a bottle of this masterpiece while sitting in Moscow. Thanks to a colleague who had delivered this and several other holiday brews. Now, if only I could get the Russians to copy this sucker!  Pours a nice cloudy rich copper color under an off white two-fingered head with body and staying power. Nice lace rings linger down the glass. There's lots of fresh sweet hops in the nose, almost like a carnation it's so sweet and flowery. The mouth is very prickly and fairly light. The taste is scrumptious - lots of sweetly bitter hops, with what almost seems like a bit of apple juice somewhere in the back to add balance. The finish is all bitter, leaving a marvellously spicy aftertaste. This was the last beer I had before going to bed last night, and the aftertaste was so good I didn't want to brush my teeth and lose it! Yum!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Redrover,4.27,"12oz mid-range brown bottle.  Beer pours a wonderful burnished copper with a massive and thick tan head.  Wow, what an aroma! You can smell the hops from about 2 feet away. Lovely aroma, all citrus, pine and floral.  Taste is rock solid. Plenty of stringent hop bite.. But this not a one trick pony. You get some underlying fruit/bread taste, but it is always backed by that great hop taste. Definite pine taste as well. The taste stays solid as the beer warms.  Soft creamy tasty mouthfeel with perfectly calibrated carbonation. Easy to drink a lot of these big boys.  What a wonderful beer!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dmarch,4.2,"Truely a beer for the hophead, but maybe a let down for anyone expecting a spiced winter ale. This is without a doubt, an IPA. Amber in color with an off-white head that diminishes into a thin lace. Hop character is piney with a bit of grapefruit. A caremel malt flavor is almost completely hidden in the hoppy bitterness. Yes the winter is a miserable time of year, but this makes me look forward to it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ecoboy,4.47,"Here's the perfect example of a numerical-rating-by-style shortcoming. Overall, this is a wonderful, drinkable brew. But I feel it is not going to please someone looking for a traditional winter ale. There should be a more obvious IPA notation on the label (akin to Geary's Winter also being an IPA, while the HSA is the true ""seasonal"") which is more about the snow and hunkering down by the fire.  Even in my notes (where I reviewed Celebration as a Christmas strong ale/winter warmer [6.8% is warm enough for me, thanks]) I wrote the ""winter for IPA lovers.""  Amber hued in the center of the glass with golden edges. Big hop whack in the aroma. Big hop infusion in the flavor. Little malt presence, and a slight touch of sour.  Three of 'em will make you love any Sandra Bullock movie.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BeerResearcher,4.27,"2003 - This deep copper/amber IPA with a solid beige head is a joy to behold. The lace is webby and clumpy in spots. The aroma is outstanding! Fresh floral and citrusy hops dominate. The faint smell of spruce, sweet malt, fruit and alcohol are present. While this is an amply malted brew, with some caramel and herbal qualities, the focus here is on the hops. Sharp-edged grapefruit bitterness and piney esters are in abundance. A light fruity background and a bit of metallic tang, along with some noticeable warming alcohol, make for a very flavorful ale, without resorting to an overwhelming quantity of alcohol. Celebration Ale will be one of the Christmas Eve offerings at my home this year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Beaver13,3.75,"The Celebration poured a copper-amber color with a nice thick, creamy head with fine bubbles that retained to the bitter end. Very nice smelling with a nice hop and spiciness balance with some floral tones. Interesting taste - medium to full bodied with a spicy, slightly sweet, initial taste with some subtle malt and fruitiness. Then come the hops! A very hoppy finish, a little too bitter for me. Overall, the Celebration is a very interesting beer. The hoppy, bitter finish and aftertaste is a little too overwhelming for me and detracts from the taste and drinkability of the beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,stirgy,4.67,"This poured out a very clear and bright orange amber color with a perfect head of dense foam. Wow, this is an intensely flavorful beer.

140,1904,TripelJ,4.78,"Reviewing from notes - 12/6/2003  Now Quaffing: Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale (IPA)  Hand-drawn tap at the Cock and Bull. This will become one of those memorable experiences that I will never forget. Poured an amazing hazy gold with a huge rocky plateau of a head that makes for an eternal wait of at least 5 minutes before the glass is filled. The delicately sweet and floral aroma is enticing. The taste and mouthfeel are what set this beer apart from other IPAs. The thick head looks deceptively solid, but reveals itself to be pure silk making for one of the smoothest mouthfeels I have ever experienced in a beer. The taste is briefly sweet with some citrus but quickly gives way to an assertive floral hop profile that is presented perfectly and lingers long after each sip. This beer is an incredible experience in alchemy. The alcohol is very deceptive in this one and I feel it drinks much stronger than its percentage.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Rastacouere,3.7,"Deep amber robe, hazy, well-laced white head from which a good part never disappears. Rich citrus (grapefruit) aroma with notes reminiscent of the christmas tree (piney, resinous, herbal). Good hop character, finish is moderately bitter, just hoppy enough I found. Medium body, good balance. It's certainly good, but it doesn't impress me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,woemad,4.32,"Bottle purchased at Jim's Homebrew in Spokane for $1.35. 2003 vintage. Poured a copper color with a lot of carbonation. White head as thick as my finger. Had a spicy hoppy scent, with a caramel-sweet maltiness hovering in the background. While the taste is dominated by hoppiness, its not overbearing like many IPAs I've known. While subdued by comparison, the maltiness is definitely not afraid to come out and play, with a nice caramel flavor that complements the spiciness of the hop flavor quite well. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. This is not something that will thrill people with an unhealty hop sensation, but it is a very drinkable IPA that I will remember when I next go for a sixer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Crosling,3.78,"Not the typical holiday time beer. I am definately not used to Holiday beers being IPA's so the pour and then the initial taste was somewhat of a shocker. This wasn't what I was expecting, somewhat of a let down considering I am not a fan of the style but it was still a pretty damn tasty IPA.  Poured a magnificent hazy rich golden copper with a head that lasted throughout the entire session.  The aroma was of citrus hops and a low malt presense.  The flavor was overwhelmingly hoppy with hints of grapefruits and other citrus flavors. Not a lot of malt presense in this beer. As my palate started to adjust towards the bitterness I actually started to enjoy this brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Weissenheimer,3.9,"Clear as crystal, this ale looks precisely like amber. It has a big, lightly tanned, foamy head which quickly dimples and becomes satisfyingly chunky. The combination of spices and hops in the smell brings Rogue Santa's Private Reserve immediately to mind, but here those two elements are more unified. The smooth, sweetly malty, and spicy scent is quite lovely.  The taste is not at all what I expected. Its surprisingly peppery spiciness is not of the sort that the smell would seem to presage. Its hoppiness reminds me again of Santa's Private Reserve, but here the hops are very crisp and not as bitter. It's quite drinkable and the big, steep peaks of lacing left at the end are a bonus, but I'm somewhat turned off by the distinct taste of pepper and the absence of the more jolly winter spices.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Malt is present, but nicely hidden.  Taste: Hops and more hops throughout!! Drying, but quite flavorful. Malt offers a wonderful balance.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and dry, with amazingly complex flavors. Slight malt sweetness adds some weight.  Drinkability: One of my top 3 winter seasonals! Fabulous. Find this one and drink all you can while it is still around.  P.S.

Lots of lacing here. Smells quite faintly of grass and lemon. Not overwhelming. So far so good.  Wow. This is nice. Quite a bit of caramel and pecan up front with just a bit of that hop burn at the end. The hop almost seems to be delayed until about 5 seconds after I swallow. A very mellow IPA with a nice solid mouthfeel. Doesn't try to blow you out, but you still get the intent.  I shall consume again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,rdrummer,4.6,"I look forward to this every year. The 2003 Celebration Ale pours a clear, medium amber with a creamy head that foams nicely and than subsides to thin lacing all the way down. The predominant aroma is the hops in this one. I am a hops addict so this one is great. There is a fruitiness underlying the hops, and there are some spices that I suspect are nutmeg, clove, and maybe cinnamon.  The overwhelming taste is the hoppiness. The carbonation is right for this type of ale. I taste a little citrus in with the hops and a definite spicy taste deep in the beer. It is excellent, and feels great in the mouth. The spicy, hops taste lingers but this is a hop lovers delight in taste and feel.  This is the most drinkable of Sierra's seasonals, and beats its flagship Pale Ale hands down. This is something to look forward to each Christmas season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Foxman,4.42,"It pours a deep, almost lustrous amber, the head swelling nicely, then ebbing to a comfy, off-white coating across the top of the beer. It laces alluringly down the sides of the glass.  The aroma is hops first, and hops last, with the citrusy fruitiness of the IPA standard hoppy characteristics. It hastens you to sip, but not too hastily, of course.  The flavor floods hops across your palate, with citrus at the fore, with perhaps a soft lemon lilt coming through, followed by a very real malt semi-sweetness. The finish is again hops, with the bitterness laying claim to the back of your tongue, leaving you wanting the next taste. As an aside, as the beer warmed, I thought I noted a very fleeting wisp of toffee or butterscotch as the malt gave way to the hops at the finish. She Who Must Be Obeyed smirked when I said this, but I stand by my senses. For better or worse.  It's medium of body, with a nice alcohol glow working its way through your mouth and downward, and a pleasant slick of hops and malt lingering just right before it dwindles.  I cannot imagine anyone not wanting another. In fact, one leads to another, drawing you in like a moth to a flame. The ABV is just such that you likely can afford to indulge in as many as your senses tell you you require to satisfy The Urge. In fact, this beer may qualify as The Gateway beer that turns you on to many others. But whatever it is, its about as good as it gets, with a few exceptions, and henceforth just the view of that festive label will be enough to make me knock off work and imbibe.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,JISurfer,3.24,"Other than the apperance, this was an above average brew for me. I am not really a hop head, so it just didn't do it for me. I will say though, that it was better than most hoppy ales. The smell was hoppy, the taste was hoppy, and that was about it. Never really got anything other than hops.

You can smell the hops when you open the bottle... serious citric/floral/pine aromas and upon closer inspection a touch of sweet malt and spice are detected. Starts off sweet before you get hit with a smack of bitter hop... serious flavor, but not at all overwhelming. A sweet bready malt accompanies the cascades to keep things in control. Finish is dry and pleasantly bitter. Mouthfeel is smooth with nice carbonation. A very warming and comforting brew.  Yep, I could live on this stuff. Always a treat year in and year out.

Great head retention and lacing that clings to my glass as I savor each sip.  The aroma is fruity, malty and hoppy. They blend together nicely to treat my nose to an olfactory delight.  The taste is bold. The hops and malts balance each other and cover my tongue with a mildly dry sensation. Dry, but not too dry. This is what all dry should be.  I could drink this sucker all the time and never apologize for it. While I did not give it a perfect score, it comes as close to perfect as an IPA should.  I wish all brewers could make beer this delightful.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,dpend,4.7,"Drawn from Hand Pump #2 at The Cock n' Bull Pub on 11/25/03  The color and aroma was glorious.An orange and amber hue hid below a pillow of eggshell white froth.Quick dissipation was not on it's list of things to do.Trails of lacing remained.The scent is of distant spice and a wallop of hops and citrus. Taste was immense with great balance and a bold finish of strong hops. Nice,smooth and a bit chewy. In my opinion, one of the best beers made. It's too bad that it's a seasonal.I could drink it all the time and never tire of it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Tballz420,4.72,"2003 edition. The body is a hazy amber/orange color, topped with a well crafted foamy white head. Excellent lacing. The scent is of hops, big hops. The taste of this brew is a excellent mix of a huge dose of hops combined with smooth malts. Very smooth feeling beer. The one problem with this is that its too easy to drink, and before you know it you will have put down ten and receive a nice reminder the next morning.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,steelreign,4.79,"The hop bomb returneth! This is the infamous SN Celebration Ale, what can be described as their Pale Ale on steroids. Sticky, slightly sweet, bitter, and hoppy - this monster will lay waste to your palette and laugh in its' wake. Not for the uninitiated, this one is supremely balanced and chock full of flavor. The only thing wrong with this brew is that it's not made year round.... Excellent! Get it while you can!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kbub6f,4,"2004:276: The small, yellowy-tan head is dense and still. Color is copper, maybe a little darker than its older brother, and no haze. Nose is sweet, but doesn't smell like sugar. It's faintly hoppy with a touch of sour milk. Front is hoppy bitter. Some nice malt in the middle, but it can't compete with the bitter hops, which pile on even stronger in the big finish. Just a smidge metallic. It's more bitter, rougher than the aged 2003 and doesn't have the nice richness of the malt. Still a good beer, of course.  2003:260: 4.0 | 4.5 | 4.5 | 4.0 | 4.0 (= 4.3) A small, tan-whitish, noisy head dies fairly quickly. The clear, deep copper beer is just a touch hazy. Psycho lacing. The nose is sweet, sugar and grapefruit hops. Starts fruity, dark hoppy, with some nice milk. Thick through the middle, dark caramel malt, some butter. Still very hoppy bitter in the finish after a year and a half. The buttery malt is really starting to shine through. Very good (quite a bit nicer than the 2004 right now, for me).  +++ 2003 fresh: 4.0 | 4.5 | 3.5 | 4.0 | 4.0 (= 3.9)  A very light, tan, crusty, sticky head leaves lots of sticky lacing. The beer is clear, reddish/amber. Nice. Huge, mouth-watering Cascade in the nose along with a sweetish maltiness. The front is very bitter but settles to a sweet, malty, somewhat creamy middle. Hoppy bitter in the finish, of course. Grapefruit burps. This is a very tasty Cascades IPA with a full malty middle. I love the hop monsters, but this one really needs to warm up for the malt to take the edge off the hops. For me, the competition in this field wins.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Running4beer,3.53,"Pours out a copper/amber color with a thick frothy off white head very nice and it maintains for quite a while then slowly thins out never fading out completely. Carbonation was moderate and had a medium bodied mouth feel. Aroma was straight up hops, citrus hops, floral hops, spiced hops and a piney/grassy aroma. Flavor was much the same as the aroma straight up hops spicey and floral hops were the strongest flavors noticable a bit and tiny bit of caramel malt. There was a slight bitterness and aftertaste IMO. Good brew but not my favorite SN....",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bditty187,4.52,"Bottle, 2003 Edition  Very lightly hazy coppery-amber hue, the off-white head reached a perfect height of a fat finger. The retention was great, firm and long lasting; it slowly compacts to a small tight cap. Modest lacing. Either this version is much hoppier in the nose that last year or I missed something previously because this is a hoppy treat. The bouquet is largely citrus (heavy on the rinds), piney, floral hops, very deep, complex, each attributes comes to the foreground, then fades, which allows a different quality to shine. Inviting. The palate is raw with hops; SN amazes me with this brew. Upfront is heavy with citrus rinds, bitter as all get out, a quick hint of floral mixes in the middle, an implication of clean malts too. The finish is a grapefruit and pine fest. I love the long lingering hoppy, bitter, raw aftertaste; Michael Jackson must have been drinking a Celebration Ale when he coined the phrase more-ish. This is a very special brew; winter would be pointless without it. At this young age it is not balanced and any mention of malts is ephemeral. Worth cellaring to mellow, if that is your bag. Medium-full in body, sturdy carbonation, very appropriate for a hearty, hoppy, winter warmer. Astonishingly drinkable! Especially if you consider the alcohol content, it is a well-hidden 6.8% abv. Highly Recommended.   Bottle, 2002 Edition (4.5 / 3.5/ 4.5 / 4 / 5) = 4.3  Terrific amber hue with a massively rocky, tan head with fantastic lace. A citrusy grapefruit dominates the nose but a noticeable hops aroma is present as well. Occasionally I could detect a note of pine. Balance was not the objective; the flavors are mainly hops... damn tasty pine (and grapefruit). Faint malt sweetness could be perceived as well. This beer is surprisingly firm, yet smooth, in the mouthfeel department. The 6.8% abv makes this a true winter warmer! This brew is lip-smacking, mouthwatering good! This is a must try! The lack of balance may deter some and the power of the hops may deter others. I think this beer is worthy of the praise, even though it is not as hoppy as I had expected.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bewareOFpenguin,4.3,"I had the good fortune of finding a sixer of this at Kappy's. Ran about $8. Had an deep amber color with a decent head. The twist off makes it way too easy. The taste was hoppy, but not over powering. The label said 2003, but I don't think the taste changes much year to year. Bitter sweet, this is a fantastic beer.

140,1904,Boilermaker88,4.25,"I decided to start my inaugural journey through the winter seasonal brews yesterday. What better way to start than with a Celebration, Sierra Nevada style. Presented in a 12oz brown bottle with a cozy picture of a snow-covered house on the label and a 2003"" on the neck label, this beer had a clear coppery color with a firm whitish head that had nice retention and left some sticky webby lace in its wake. Lots of carbonation noted. I picked up the aroma from nearly a foot away! Wow, that has a seriously hopped aroma. Lots of citrus aroma and spruce pine scents with some toasty malt and caramel intermixed to keep things in check. The taste was a hearty blend of pine- and grapefruit hops juiciness that ruled the glass, allowing the malt aspect to make only brief appearances to balance things out. The hops keep marching on through the finish, leaving a lasting bitterness and making for some lively hops burps later. The feel was medium-bodied, smooth and a bit resiny as the spruce carpets the tongue. Definitely not what I expected for a winter seasonal. Great thing was, I had a desire for a well hopped beer when I got home from work. Celebration was just the ticket. A really well-built IPA. Too bad it isnt around all year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Ellbert,4.74,"This is a wonderful brew. It has a decent apperance. There wasn't much of a head and just a little lace. That took points away from the apperance.  The smell is that of a good IPA, very floral and citrusy with a bit of malt sweetness.  The taste is exceptional with different flavors coming in at different times. There is a nice sweet maltiness to go along with the bitter fruitiness of the hops. Well balanced with the hops upfront.  Mouthfeel is great, it is very smooth with sublte carbonation.  Very drinkable and very buyable for 5.49 a sixer in Toledo Ohio.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ColForbin,5,"SNCA may just be my favorite beer in the world - certainly my favorite American beer. I twist off the cap of a 2003 bottle with much anticipation. It pours an orangey-red with with a thin, fine-bubbled head. The nose is full of piney hops, making me remember that this is the drink to set up a Christmas tree with - forget egg nog. Taste is all hops, but with a firm malty body to back it up. Just the perfect mouthfeel to keep you coming back for more - not too thick, not too thin. A perfect beer, hence the 5's in all categories.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,AbePhroman,4.4,"When I first bought this I didn't know it was an IPA. I was so delighted when I took the first sip out of my glass. IPA's are one of favorite types of brews. Pours a dark red color with a tan head. Smoooth taste!! Tasty, tasty hoppiness, how do I love thee! Very drinkable beer. 6.8% isn't something to laugh at but it leaves room for a good amount. Snatch this up while you can because it will be gone before spring. (Actually, I was at a local liquor store in Jersey the other day and they still had 2002 on the shelf...I passed.)

140,1904,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.15,"2003 was the first year I tasted this, which turns out to be something I should have done earlier. Pours starting out with a nice two-finger head, fluffy in the middle, with a medium bead. After a minute or two, head subsides and remains at about one finger or so. Abundant bubble strings streaming through deep bronze-colored liquid, almost glowing orange around the edges of the glass when held up to light. Nice color! Lace is clingy at first; later slides easily down sides of glass. Aroma is distinctly citric and hoppy; by aroma alone you can recognize this as an IPA. Caramelly hints of malt in the middle of the nose. Taste is of lots of American hop, citrusy juiciness, and another light, caramelly maltiness at the back of the palate. Lemon juice, orange rinds; just a touch of spice, nutmeg? clove? consistent with the season. Mouthfeel is outstanding. Juicy, wet, moreish, with that citric character really cleansing the palate with lemony wetness, not as dry as the majority of IPAs. No alcohol taste to speak of; deeply quenching and moreish. Very drinkable... the first time I encountered this beer was on draft and I wasn't familiar with the alcohol content, so a friend and myself ordered it by the pitcher and treated it like a session beer, which, in retrospect, wasn't the most accurate approach. That won't keep me from enjoying a few more six-packs (at a more appropriate pace) this season. Its chart position is understandable...

140,1904,BierManVA,3.73,"It's difficult for me to review IPA's because they are a bier that I am not particularly agreeable about. But I do recognize this one as pretty good.  Excellent appearance, a massive head and redish amber color. The smell is crisp medicinal hop.  Tastewise, the hops really come through and you better have excellent tastebuds to get anything other than bitter. And I do mean bitter. I guess I don't qualify.  If you like IPA's, this bier's for you.  John",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mschofield,4.92,"2003 bottling Nice orange-red color with a thick off-white head, laces very well. Strong hoppy aroma with some spice, I already know I'll like this one. Hops carry through to the taste, and theres some orange zest in there with spruce. A little bitter but oh so smooth. As for drinkability.. this is a holiday present from Sierra Nevada to beer drinkers, I could buy it by the case.  2004 bottling Pours a rich, clear copper-amber, topped with a two finger creamy khaki head, leaves webs of lacing. Citrus and leafy hop, toasted malt, bread and spruce aroma. Awesome hop flavor, citrus, flowers, pine, toast and caramel. Nice high bitterness, strong but not obnoxious. Dark toffee note. Awesome at cellar (55-60) temperature.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Stingray5,4.82,"Celebration Ale, where have you been all my life? Somehow this ale has flown under my radar, until now. It was worth the wait. Orange hues with a fluffy white head. Very clear and neat. Aromas billow from the glass, with fresh pine hops and malt undertones. Taste is oh so fresh - supreme balance of malt and mega hops. Superb. Fresh hop leaf finish.  Until now, I'd had no idea this brew even existed. I have a lot of catching up to do.  12/27/03 Had it on tap. Even better. Fresher, hoppier, tastier.

Smell: Dry floral hops... lots of 'em... the SN of SN hops. This is exactly what an IPA should smell like. The malt foundation does poke through if you're patient. Superb. Taste: Hop oils and carbonation grab your tongue and give it a good old-fashioned tingling. Toasted malt fills in behind before the hops return with a vengence to finish 'er of with a dry floral flourish. Perfect IPA imbalance. Mouthfeel: Oily hops, decent malt body, carbonation just slightly heavy. Drinkability: Grab a case or two and get ready for snow. Yum.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,OldFrothingSlosh,4.2,"2003 Vintage: Poured a clear, deep amber in color. Lots of bubbles rising up from the bottom. Tight layer of white lace atop the beer. Good quality lacing of the glass. Aromas are floral/citrus, with some delicate sweetness peeking through. Still the same hefty dose of hoppy bitterness that really dominates. A little bit of balancing by the malt. Spicy notes also present. Very bitter at the end, with a mouth-puckering dryness. A touch on the harsh side, I'm hoping some aging will mellow this out. A very good seasonal that gets better with age.  2002 Vintage: When my friend told of this offering, I ran out to my local Total Wine and picked up a few 6-packs. Wow! I was not disappointed. Pouring a lovely copper color with a hoppy blast at the beginning, it offered exquisite mouthfeel and citrusy aroma and also finished with a strong hoppy influence.  Get some if you can.

140,1904,Elemental,4.42,"This is for the 2003 release. pretty much the same as far as appearance, color and head go. But the aromas and taste are definately different. The main noticable difference this year is in the hops. There is a more grassy straw aroma and taste. Its tart and tasty. Not too sweet and not to bitter. Though it definately is a bitter beer. Once again SN comes up with another great seasonal.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BigPapaLager,3.95,"The beer that i've been tying to find up here for a week or so. Poured a medium head, receding slowly.

140,1904,chaduvel,3.65,"2003 edition. Ahh, first holiday beer of the year. Dark amber, sticky head with good retention. Smell is hops, hops, hops, hops, and hops. Piney, sprucy strong hops. Touch of malt at the beginning and then painful Xmas tree hops flood the palate and leave a lasting intense bitterness. Not enough balance here. There seems to be a touch of clove or nutmeg or cinnamon in here. Pretty tasty but I would have liked to have these holiday spices have more presence, and overall this one isn't balanced for my taste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CSimon,4.82,"2003 in a bottle.  Year after year, Celebration nails it.  Beautiful rich amber-brown color. Pours a nice full head for an IPA.  There is grapefruit. Hops. But, unlike lots of great IPAs, this has some malt for balance. I tend to like the big extreme hoppy IPAs. But, I have a real apprecaition for the way that Celebraton has some malt to tame the hops. In fact, my brother, who isn't a huge beer fan, and generally prefers blanced beers, enjoys Celebration. A real oddity in that this beer has appeal to beer-drinkers of all types.  The brewer from Bell's was at The Brickskeller a few weeks ago singing the praises of Sierra Nevada's consistency. He has a point. Celebration never disappoints.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,OatmattStout,4.35,"Real nice color with a substantial tan head. Nose of carmal and hops. Mouthfeel is really smooth with a slick and expanding carbonation around the tounge. Taste is great, real hop bang with pine and grapefruit characteristics and a nice lingering hop head bite, just like you would expect from a West Coast brew. Has some real good sweet, caramel and lightly toasted notes on the malt side. Overall a big delicious IPA.  EDIT: 11-2010 same great IPA, very spicy hop notes and very green grassy fresh hop nose and taste. like throwing in a hop dip straight from the vine, nice and oily",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,rabidawg,4.5,"2003 model  As compared to an aged version of last year's model (reviewed on 07/23/03), the fresh Celebration is much more highly hopped, both in nose and in the taste, with a big, citric hop bite and huge lingering bitterness. Tastes very green, and I definitely prefer the mellowed version. Fresh it's not as balanced, but certainly a great IPA. Slightly downgraded in the flavor department.   2002 model. Just purchased today; unsure of storage conditions.  Rating: 4.5 4.5 5 4.5 4.5  Appearance: Ruby-chestnut body with a big, soft, fluffy, rocky head. Slowly settled into a thin cap, lacing like a beast.  Smell: Wow. Potent hop aroma with a noticeable malt background. Slightly spicy, but in a very natural way. Barely noticeable alcohol presence. Hops definitely take the lead, with soft citrus fruit (orange peel?) dominating.  Taste: Incredibly balanced. Possibly the most balanced ""big"" IPA I've ever had. Reminiscent of an even better version of Ipswich's IPA, with regards to the malt/hops balance. Almost sweet at first, with a spiciness I just can't place. The hops are subdued and balanced, but still leafy and fresh. Finishes nicely, very smooth and round. Creamy mouth, and very full. Very satisfying, but I still want more!  Notes: Excellent, excellent beer. I can't wait to taste this along with next year's version, as I've never had a truly fresh bottle. Highly recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,hotstuff,3.08,2002 On Tap:This beer's appearance was a small sized ivory head that was creamy and smooth and contained fine-small sized bubbles that was mostly lasting.The body was uncarbonated and clear with a reddish hue.The nose was hoppy and malty with a very bitter and hoppy flavor.The mouthfeel was fairly smooth and somewhat tingly and it was medium bodied.There was a fair amount of lacing with this beer.I am not a hop head by any means so this one tasted very hoppy and bitter to me.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,PSUDREW,4.37,"2003 edition:  Poured out that amber hue, some head retention, lots and lots of lace. Once in your mouth, it's lighter body is somewhat deceptive of it's real power.

Seasonals- YAY!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Shiredave,4.55,"2003 Vintage. Just in time for freezing nights in NY. Classic red amber color, comforting floral aroma with pine forest and vanilla notes. Flavor is sugar coated tangerines in a doughy blanket. As usual, great balance of gritty malt and rough edged hop bite. Finish is all about lingering resinous piney hop and a trickle of alcohol burn. Mouth feel is a bit light and dry - medium body is there, but the hops havent mellowed yet. Bottles need a few weeks/ months to reach peak IMHO. IPA, Winter warmer, whatever you want to call it, SNCA is to me, one of the best large production beers available. A valid reason to look forward to Winter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beernbbq,4.5,The 2003 edition and how happy am I. Beautifully constructed (again) with a combination of I assume those biscuity english and caramel malts and a good hit of cascade hops along with a few other varieties for good measure. Just outstanding and will need to go get another sixer soon. Makes winter a lot more tolerable.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,TinusTime,4.3,"Pours a nice reddish brown with a nice long lasting head that laces beautifully down the glass.  Smell is citrusy grapfruity hops with foresty spice and pine thrown in the background  Taste Yumm-- I love this stuff.. Nice assertive hoppyness with enough of a malty backbone to make it interesting and give it a hint of spice. This years might be a bit rough on the hops, but i am hoping that that will mellow and balance a bit more.  Mouthfeel, nice good carbonation, very drying on the finish. It will make someone not used to hops pucker  Drinkability-- Can drink it all night, I never get tired of drinking this beer, the only thing that keeps drinkablity from a 5 is that the ABV is 6.8 so a few to many and the Celebration will end with a fall.

Aroma sported strong hops, with a sweet / sour sensation. The taste is great - strong hops with a nice balance of sweet malt. Some citrus seems to arrive on the tongue with the bitterness after swallowing. The carbonation level is perfect, giving some crispness to the mouthfeel. Alcohol level is barely detectable.

140,1904,Jarod,4.1,"YEAR OF 2002 12 oz bottle  This beer poured a golden/orange/brown color that at first pour was slightly cloudy but as it neared the end on the bottle because &#8220;chunky&#8221;, but that is OK by me. It was well carbonated. It produced a thick off white creamy head that was the consistency of a marshmallow, thick and semi-lasting, but soon fell to a small skim on the surface and a thick ring on the edges. Some lace was present, in sheet form. The aromas that came from the glass were surprisingly subtle, but complex as it warmed. Smells of fresh floral hops, spices, some fruits (plums, a bite from a fresh cut pineapple, and some citrus), rich malts came through in the middle to end of the whiff and finished with a fresh cut pine tree aroma. Well balanced in the aroma department once it sat and warmed. The flavors were more complex then the aromas and again became more pronounced as the temp. rose a few degrees. Floral hops first hit my nose with a fresh piney aroma, then a rich and roasted malt seemed to emerge as well as fresh and dark fruits (plums, apricots), a citrus bite (lemon rinds and pineapples) soon took over as it entered the back of my throat then a dry bark like flavor finished the taste off. The aftertaste was mainly of hops and flowers, with hints of bark, not long lasting but present when I exhaled. The body was medium. A smooth and creamy beer that was well balanced in flavors and aromas, and a pleasure to drink. It was not overly hopped, like I thought it would have been, because I believe the ageing did it well. This beer was fairly decent and refreshing when served cold, but when it warmed it became an incredible beer experience that was well balanced in all aspects. I am currently aging another bottle of 02&#8217; for the next year or so.  And as far as the 6.8% ABV, you would never know it was even there, it was that well hidden with all the flavors.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beergeek279,4,"Served in the 12 oz. bottle. The color was golden, with a thick, creamy head. The smell was very lightly hoppy. The taste wasn't the overwhelming hop boutique I expected. Rather than the citrus taste I'm used to, the hop taste was rather dry...almost like a dry hopping. Mouthfeel was smooth. As for drinkability, could have a few more.  I just wasn't as overwhelmed by this beer as most people seemed to be. It's not bad in any way, it's just not up there with my favorite IPAs (HopDevil, Ruination, etc.).

Head quickly dissipates to a film after a short time and leaves a wonderful bit of IPA-typical lacing.  Smell: Thick and juicy piney hops balanced by robust grapefruit citrus aromas. Malt makes an appearance. Overall, great balance.  Taste: A salty bitter taste initially. Hops give way to some decent malt flavors. Grapefruit notes throughout.  Mouthfeel: Solid medium body, vaguely creamy with a modicum of astringency from all the hoppy goodness.  Drinkability: An excellent offering. SN Celebration is basically SNPA on steroids. A beer worth wishing the onset of winter for.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,nomad,4.5,"Poured a reddish amber, what I would call a beautiful iridiscent color. Had a bubbly pocky foam falling to a thin and sudsy head, and not always much lace. A wonderful color, though.  Smelled of sweet grapefruit with spikes of pine attached to it, like a syrupy hop juice. Great caramel malt in the background. Overall, for me this beer had the presence of when you're cooking a good piece food and it starts releasing its fresh essentials oils - that's what the wonderful hop presence smelled like. Always in front of a setting sun of rosy waves.  Taste was of a delectable bitterness: juicy, tart, cutting, and with abundantly high-grade freshness, it was all propped up on a rosy juice flavor. Had some lemon flavors right before the finish, like biting into a wonderfully balanced hop juice. The beer settled well with opening and my tastebuds adjusting to the bitterness. After getting used to this beer I noticed a masterful amber ale flavored malt, bordering on rosy but made even more spiky that big ol' bitter.  Nice drinkable mouthfeel, I call this the star of Sierra Nevada. I crave having this beer around through the cooler months.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HardTarget,4.18,"2002 vintage, sampled Nov. 2003 Aroma: Citric pine hops swirl from the top Appearance: Red tinged orange with some chill haze frosting the glass, topped with a snow-covered head that slowly melts down the side leaving icicles of lace Flavor: You have been good this year, St. Nick has brought many hops for you to enjoy, backed with just enough hearty malt to keep the fresh pine hop taste, but stave off the bitter cold Mouthfeel: cheerful, bubbly warmth that refreshes and soothes Overall Impression: Even though it&#8217;s 87 degrees outside, this beer summoned the Christmas spirit in me. It warmed me with its potent alcohol level, cheered me with its color and lace, and impressed me with a full hop taste but no impulse to pucker. I&#8217;m a fairly rabid hophead, but the intensity of the taste and the potent alcohol kick (which is felt much more than tasted) cuts back on drinkability. Like Christmas, part of the magic is in the rarity of the experience. Paired it with a smoked Gouda cheese, which complimented it well.

140,1904,budgood1,4.53,"2003  my first celebration!  pours out a hazy bright amber colour...slight and tight off white head and lots of festive lace. looks delicious. huge hop aroma...spruce and pine...followed by a citrus punch. a x-mas tree jammed into every bottle. the taste is all about the bitterness and the hop load that provides every perceiveable angle at hop nirvana. cascade hops run roughshod over my taste buds. a bit harsh for non IPA lovers but just right for me. malt backbone is ample and telling, but seemingly meek and mild in comparison to the sensory overload that is the mighty hop. mouthfeel full and explosively bitter. finish is zesty and hopliciously bitter. i can see why this is a classic beer to age just for the intrigue that surrounds what this ale could morph into.  as it is fresh and full of gusto...it is unbalanced and extremely bitter. delicious nonetheless. because a steady supply of SN has finally reached my area, i will be buying as much of this as i can to drink this holiday season and a bunch more to lay down and age for future reference. wow is this a killer IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,WVbeergeek,4.57,"SNCA 2003  Appearance: Immaculatey forms with deep copper amber tone and a two finger sized cream colored head leaves behind scattered lacing very nice brew. Aroma: This one doesn't take you by the hand, it just wallops you with cascades and a huge layered malt profile, floral and piney with a caramel malt like sweet scent this one is amazing. Taste: Well, I this beer and I met early in my beer journey a few years back when I was first getting into beers I ran into this on tap in Fuel and Fuddle in the Oakland area of Pittsburgh. To this point my brother Dante' and friend Kolby had tried many different beers together, however after ordering the SNCA my bro and friend were totally turned off making statements like ""this tastes like pine sol"" and ""that's overkill on the hops"" well I am proud to say I didn't have that reaction. I absolutely love this beer from the first time I tasted it. Cascades slide upon the palate with an oily resin given them their lubricant capable of being so silky and smooth, while the hops do steal the show I still find this one balanced enough with caramel sweet sticky maltiness so good. Mouthfeel: Perfect carbonation, hop burps come after only three or four sips medium bodied well textured I love it. Drinkability: Definitely need to pick up a case of this beer this coming winter enough hops and malt to keep me happy for a long time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,leeenglewood,4.48,2003 batch kind of weird seeing poinsettias on Halloween but oh well. Dark amber color with a head that is bubbly and coats the glass to the last drop. Smells of sweet version of pine resin very hoppy. Hops come threw full bore in the initial taste but a slight malt sweetness comes threw on the aftertaste. Not being a real hophead I fully appreciate this beer for it gives one of the best tastes of a truly hoppy beers where everything tastes like it is unison.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Dmann,5,"In my opinion, this is the perfect beer. I had this baby on tap for the first time tonight and was blown away. It has a beautiful dark red/amber colour with a nice white head that left great lace down the whole glass. The smell was great;the hops jumped right out at you and did not let go, and the citric bite was prevelant as well. the taste was pure beer goodness with the perfect mixture of hop bitterness and a touch of malty sweetness to balance it out. There were also great citric flavors in there and it was not really dry tasting like a lot of IPA type beers are, but it was very very drinkable. If you can find this brew on tap or in the bottle, you will definantly be hooked!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,edchicma,4.35,"Hopheads paradise brew. Excellent cloudy copper appearance, with a chunky head that laces nicely. Oustanding smell, citrusy with strong hop presence. Taste is pure hops straight forward and delicious. Aftertaste remains nicely in its bitterness. A slight puckery mouthfeel reminds you of the hop presence. Very drinkable for a high abv and hyper hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,alexgash,4.23,"I sure was glad to see a new beer at the Utah State Liquor Store, especially one as delicious as this. 2003 edition. Amber/copper body with a sticky, light tan head. Very good retention. Smells of some maltiness, but mostly hops, hops, and hops. Very resiny and sprucy. Very appetizing as well. Taste reveals more malt than the smell. Not too sweet, but good body to balance the crazy hops. Very resiny, piney, spicy, and medicinal. As the beer warmed, I swear I was tasting some hints of nutmeg as well. A crescendo of Xmas tree bitterness lingers into the finish. Very good, but not my favorite high-octane IPA. Big and oily mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable for its strength and bitterness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,hungryghost,4.3,"I was super surprised to see this on tap last week. In October no less! Celebration is a good amber color, maybe a little darker than the regular Sierra pale ale. Frothy, white head stays around for a bit. Smell is good, hoppiness for sure, some citrus, malt. Hoppy through and through, strongly bittered, but not over the top. I get a hint of sweet as it goes down, nice to round out the taste and mouthfeel. You are not left with a bitter aftertaste. This is a really good one, especially on tap. Since it has the high ABV, I usually have maybe two pints, move on to something else and call it a nite.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jermar,4.5,Had this on tap at Anam Cara. Tasted very similar to last year's offering (of which me and my wife consumed probably 5 cases). Just looking now for a local package store that has the cases in stock for under $30. A wonderful hoppiness with enough malt body to support it. Nice russet/orange color and aromatics.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,rkhaze,4.42,"2003 Edition. Always look forward to this one. A winter classic! Poured an orange/amber color with a rich thick white head that left good sticky lace. Dynamite aroma. BIG hops, fresh, citrusy and spicy. Some sweet malt in the background. The taste is fresh hops upfront with an almost pine/spruce oiliness. Some sweet malt and caramel in the middle, finishing with that spicy, pungent grapefruit aftertaste that I love Sierra for. It's been better balanced in previous years. A hopheads delight  Nice mouthfeel and carbonation. Rich, full and a creamy lemon tanginess. Excellent drinkability. Year after year, a great offering from Sierra. A little less balanced than previous years but if you like your hops to punch first and ask questions later, then this is a beer for you. Highly recommended!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RootedFool,4.77,"2003 edition.  Pours solid amber with a bright white head that receded quickly leaving lace like falling swaths of snow.  Smell is complex. Hops intermingling with spices my novice tongue could not quite identify; lemony, bready, behind the strong hops and alcohol that is warming to the tongue.  Mouthfeel is creamy, hearty, and perfectly carries the intricate taste and smell.  I'm looking forward to drinking more of this while it lasts. It's only October, so I have awhile to go. I think this is the first review of the 2003 edition, and it's also my first ever beer review!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Rumrunner,4.3,12oz. bottle. 2002 Vintage.  An excellent hoppy beer with enough crispness for me to wish it was snowing in southern California right now.  This ale pours a deep burnt amber color. A good white head and okay lacing. The scents are a fight for dominence. At first the hops attack the nose and are quite controlling. Some sweet lemon grass are present with a dry quality on the nose. There is a secondary caramel malt and sweetness that slowly follow this up. There is no real balance. It is just one smell after the other.  The flavors start with a dry burnt hoppy flavor. Some bitter citrus and a medium rind flavor. A bready and sweet malt follow the hops but are no match. The hops are dominant. There is a dry sweet vermouth finish. The alcohol is very present but it does not disrupt the flavors.  This is a very smooth drinker. It has some oily qualities but they do not hinder the enjoyment of this IPA. Very crisp and dry on the palate. Very nicely done.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,soilguy,4.32,2002 vintage - Nice big hoppy aroma is a most noticeable feature. The color is a golden amber - very small head when poured. Has a nice malty sweetness that is immediately offset by a citrusy hop bite. This follows into a pungent aftertaste. The mouthfeel is nice and full. I can hardly wait for the 2003 version!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beerguy101,4.2,"Rating is for 2002 version .Medium gold color, large foamy head. Hoppy spicy aroma. Malty and very aggressively hopped. Malts are slightly sweet and balance the big bold hops well. Think this year's version is better than the 2000 edition. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter, Bid bodied IPA. Really nice. Well age well I think. 2000 vintage- Medium brown color, small head. Medium malts, aggressively hopped ale. Full flavor, full mouthfeel, nearly chewy. Good hop to malt balance. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is bitter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Gueuzedude,5,"Ok, I freely admit it I am extremely biased when it comes to this beer. I used to buy cases of this stuff every year. I finally broke down and started to buy a keg of it instead. The first time I had this it absolutely blew me away. The hops where so intense so fresh the just screamed to break free from the confines of the bottle. This beer is definitely best when fresh, because it is all about the hop flavor and aroma. The hops lend a wonderful spicy citrusy greatness to this beer. And wonderfully the brewers saw fit to outfit this paragon with a solid malt backbone that just carries and delivers the hop celebration to every corner of your mouth. Just a plain awesome beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ellman,4.47,"2001 Cellared  Appearance: Amber in color witha slight hazyness, nise full head that did not fade.

Drinkability: Could drink alot if i had it. but in short supply",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,indiapaleale,4,"2009 - Pour - Light amber almost golden in appearance. Nice clean, clear pour with a big fluffy white head. Looking pretty damn good.  Aroma - Fresh pine along with lots of citrus such as lemons and oranges. Not so much the pineapple or grapefruit like some other West Coast IPAs. Very nice floral hop profile with just a touch of heat from the alcohol percentage involved.  Taste - Tongue and nose tinglingly hoppy. Plenty of piney goodness for which this beer has become known. The bitterness is right there from the start followed by a decent amount of malty sweetness to even things out. Very crisp and dry in the finish.  Overall - Very solid IPA. This is a pretty classic hops forward California IPA that has been around much longer than most other American IPAs. Big hoppy flavor with an ABV that warms the stomach nicely.  Would I buy more of it? - Yes, yes I would. I'll be buying some every year for the rest of my life probably.  Note: This year, 2009, marks the first time Sierra Nevada has released its Celebration Ale in their signature 24 oz. bottles. Perfect for sharing with a good friend on a cold night and also great for storing away for next winter to do a little side by side comparison with a fresh bottle.  Vintage: This bottle rolled of the line on Friday, October 2nd, 2009.  2008 - Pour - Dark amber and slightly hazy. There might be some suspended yeast making this a bit murky. Time has definitely taken the clarity away from the '08. The off-white head however is very thick and quite impressive.  Aroma - Burnt sugar/caramel is the big dominating smell. This is some malty stuff with a very slight hint of citrus. The hops have all but gone away. Reminds me of a Barleywine almost.  Taste - As far as flavor goes, this may smell like a Barleywine but the taste is more like a Scottish Ale. Big malty sweetness with only a tiny bit of bitterness in the finish. It has an apple cider thing going on and all the fresh, piney hop flavors have long been diminished.  Overall - After a year this has become a whole new monster. Malty sweetness has replaced bitter hoppiness and morphed this into something akin to a Scottish Ale or a Barleywine. The hops may be long gone but this is still a very drinkable beer. The past year has really smoothed things out. Definitely a delicious beer but I prefer the fresh stuff.  Would I buy more of it? - Absolutely, although this vintage is no longer available as the 2009 bottles have now hit the shelves. I may have to put away several of the 09s for 3 or 4 years down the road.  Note: Celebration Ale is the second highest selling beer for Sierra Nevada, falling behind only the almighty Pale Ale in volume sold. I can't seem to lock down a date in which Sierra Nevada first released their Celebration Ale but it was sometime back in the early 80s. Anyone know the answer?  Vintage: This bottle rolled off the line on Friday, October 17th, 2008.  2002-Crisp and intensely hoppy. A nice clean light amber color with floral scents and almost a bitter lemon feel. It leaves the tongue beat up with hops, but you need to go in expecting that. I really like this stuff and am glad it changes both every year it is made as well as every year it ages.  1996-Very malty in taste, that hoppiness that is so present in the unaged stuff is gone. It is a darker amber color with many complex flavors. Sample as many years as you can, its a great beer to put aside and let age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cerevisiaephilus,4.45,"One of my all time favorite beers. A beer that screams with hop flavor, like someone squeezed a grapefruit in the bottle. The chinook, centennial and cascade hops stand up proud for sure. This beer also has a very stiff malt backbone that makes the beer very enjoyable overall...and quite drinkable...just don't drink it first in a flight cause it will ruin you.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beerinator,4,"Appearance: Amber, light tan head.  Aroma: Hoppy Aroma, more piney than citrusy, but citrus is present as well.  Taste: Very balanced. The hops follow the malt sweetness and the two merge on the tongue.  Notes: In my opinion this beer gains nothing from aging. It's perfectly balanced now. I've tried one aged 6 years or so lately, and while it was still good, it had lost most of its hoppy characteristics. Find something to celebrate about this year, and buy a case or two!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bierman2000,3.8,"A strong IPA that is almost like a Winter Ale, very smooth yet hoppy in the final taste.

Aroma: Large dollop of cirtus hops may smack your nose, but honey-sweet malt undertones not to be denied.  Taste: Vibrant grapefruit-like hops compliment a delicious caramel malt backbone; floral notes abound; subtle traces of orange lurk in the background.

I still remember my first Celebration Ale several years ago. I thought I had found a close to perfect beer, and still go into ectasy when pouring the first one of the new batch each fall.  This ale pours an incredible bright reddish amber and has a creamy head that carries drapes of lace down the glass. Hoppiness is very pronounced in the nose and flavor, but does not take over the complexity of the malt.  2002 was not the best of the years, but was still one of the greats.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,BittRnessabounds,4.59,"I've had many of these fine beers from the 2002 batch. What a wonderful and warming beer. You don't need to be celebrating something to drink this beer, you should just be celebrating it's existence. I sure celebrated finding this beer (3 actually, shared with Marty and EmoBeerGuy) discarded in a dorm hallway next to a trash-can. I don't know who discarded it, but we were more than happy to give them a home. I finally drank mine, probably the last one I'll find until next year, today on a cool late summer day. It was just as good as I remembered all the others this year being. The wonderful deep amber and thick head with lace that does not quit is only a modest hint of greater things to come. The wonderful hop aroma is likely the most pleasant I've experienced. If you like very hoppy beers that are nearly perfectly balanced with malt and some fruit, you will love this beer. The medium body and near perfect carbonation make this beer a pure joy to drink. The 6.8abv doesn't hurt either, considering there is no hint at all of the strength of this beer. All in all this is just a great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The color is a cloudy brownish red. The smell of spices and hops are very overwhelming, but exceptional! The taste is all spice and hops. There is maybe a little bit of clove or nutmeg in this one, and it has a good bitter finish from the cascade hops. The drinkability is very good for this style.

140,1904,marburg,4.12,"Wow. More hops than a pogo stick, folks.  Fairly big, fluffy, white head. Farmer's market aroma -- fresh flowers and citrus fruits -- that includes the very floral and evergreen hop aromas. Nicely medium-bodied. The hops are definitely the predominant flavor generator in this brew; they creep over the tongue from start to finish. Very subtle -- a wee bit of an unbalanced flavor here -- malt sweetness upfront and through the middle, but this finishes with a clean, big hop presence. I had two, but I don't think I could have any more; it just lies a bit to far over the hoppy line to drink a lot, but the high alcohol content is very deceiving. I really love Sierra Nevada, and this is another great offering from them.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Quite a pleasant surprise, thanks SN.  Color is a golden orange with a off-white head about a finger high, top is lumpy with some big bubbles: settles to a nice even skimming with some nice clingy, patchy light lace. Smell is a nice floral, lightly citrusy sharp hop, super clean and fresh. Taste is very smooth and bright with brightly floral hop thats a little bit spicy and bitter as well. Feel is a lighter-medium body with a very crispy sweet dryness that starts in the middle and settles down through the finish and has a great evenly smoothed out bite with a very subtle but potent alcohol warming, which only now I'm starting to feel.

Not the first time I've had this beer and certainly not the last. Deep golden-amber hue, deeper than most IPA. Nose is straight hops, to warn you of whats about to hit your palate. The flavor is a hop lovers dream. Straight hops all the way, classic over the top American IPA. What I think is so amazing about this beer is the ABV which is totally inconito. I would have never know. This is a beer that, if drank in large quantities, would surely sneak up on you.

Taste: Initial hoppy bitterness. Citrus flavor comes in next followed by a strong malt balance. Aftertaste is bitter and fruity, with some malt sweetness making an appearance every so often.

The taste is primarily floral hops throughout with just a hint of orange peel, banana and very slight roasted malt, but overall powering on the hops.

Hints of citrus peel were detected amongst the intense scent of hops. This is one great full-bodied beer that packs a full arsenal of hops.

140,1904,Darkale,4.48,"I look forward to this beer every year, and the 2002 version did not let me down.  Everyone knows the festive label on this 12 ounce brown bottle: the gold Sierra Nevada logo on unfurled parchment, with a log cabin in the snow below, poinsettias all around.  Inside is one of the best winter ales one is likely to encounter. Cheery orange-red color, and a nice, thick, frothy tan head. Excellent lacing and a slight hop aroma upon opening.  Taste is citrus at first, followed by hops. Then, a slow malty aftertaste, mingled with toasty caramel. Creamy, very creamy mouthfeel, especially as it warms, and this is a beer that you will not want to serve very cold.  Complex, warming, consistent, a great winter ale -- one whose passing I mourn every spring.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Hobbz,4.2,"Waiting on friends and having sampled the run of draft beers that I would order, I asked for an old stand-by Sam Smith's which was not carried any more. What other bottles, then? Celebration (and a host of mass-swill). Stared at the nice label graphics then poured into my waiting glass. Fine all-around look to this one -- deep hazy-brown and few, tiny foam bubbles of white, running for the sides. Bold, hoppy aroma. This beer held captive the Cascade hops that I love, only releasing the chain-gang busters once inside. And the flavors of this seasonal carried over nicely with each sip. De-lish hops, de-lish beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,scottum,4.26,"This is one of the few great beers that is affordable to buy by the case. This is a very hoppy brew. Almost like a Kangaroo on steroids. Pours out dark amber with a nice head. Tastes of hops. If you let it warm up a bit, it becomes a more complex brew, but still a hop monster. You should always have a few of these on hand.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Bruiser81,4.82,"This brew poured a copper color with sort of an amber color when held to the light. The head was off-white and about a quarter of an inch thick. The aroma was complex with hints of citrus, hops, and alcohol. The taste was basically the same as the nose with citrus up front and the spice of the alcohol in the middle. The finish is bittery with a nice bite, the citrus also comes back a little in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was nice with good carbonation and it went down smooth. This is my favorite winter seasonal and in my top three overall, what a great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jeffboo,4.45,"One of the classic strong pale ales out there. I'm a little surprised it's not a year round beer. This is a holiday beer for the hopheads if the sweeter seasonals are not your thing. This one pours a wonderful deep bronze color with a fluffy golden head. Citrus and pine jump out of the glass, most definitely a dry hopped beer. MMM it has a solid malt base to play off the playful hops. It could do with a touch more body to equalize the bitterness but that's just nitpicking.This beer has a slight chewiness to the body that dances with the hops,maybe it is the yeasty fruitiness here with a tiny bit of caramel malt. The hops give a nice citrus flavor that's almost flowery and a nice long bitter finish.Nicely balanced.As it warms a very nice grapefruit flavor stands out. I like it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,greebz,4.7,"This is one of the beers that I actually seek out to buy every year. Unfortunately it's not readily available here on the east coast. Once again this yrs version did not disappoint if you like this type of ale. Nice copper color with decent head that leaves a nice lace on the glass. Slightly bitter, this is not the type of beer that you chug nor do have several at a sitting. Also it help to pair with the right food - spicy work well. I've never seen this on tap but would certainly love to find it, let me know if anyone knows where in the Boston area!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Good appearance pours a nice murky brown with a smallish head that leaves a lace down the glass. The smell is unbelievable..marvelous the last few nights I have had some great smelloing beers this is another!..malt and big hop smell combine, a work of art. very treacly taste bitter aftertaste on back of tongue..strong coffee even..a meal in a bottle. Lovelly over the tongue warming.. Very drinkable for such a strong brew..and none of the stringent alchol taste..great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,paceyourself,4.44,"Very different from most winter seasonals iv'e had. The copper color is hazed with a very fine sediment. The white pillowy head fades and leaves a thin lace as you drink. A strong citric aroma of hops and medicinal alcohol lets you know your in for something special. The taste is spicy and balanced at first then the hoppy bitter flavor asserts itself and lingers. A great choice to have with some spicy food, i enjoyed it with some hot wings.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,vitesse,3.28,"This is a good looking beer. The color is a nice light amber color. The head is has that creamy texture on top that stays around a while. The beer leaves a nice lace around the glass. Their is some haziness too. The smell is another strong point. I detected some citrus, fruit and even flowery notes in the smell. pretty good in this area. For an american IPA, i guess the taste they want above all else is hops, and to that end, they succeed. I was really disappointed with this beer, however. It seemed like the hops were just too up front. I know this is a sierra nevada brew, but even so... If you like hoppy west coast-style beers, this is for you. If not, their are much better winter beers. I just don't think this fits as a winter seasonal when you live somewhere cold and snowy. That's the bottom line for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,feloniousmonk,4.32,"Color is a dark amber,edging into red, with a huge, handsome, off-white head. Aroma explodes with hops, calling forth sensations of citrus, grapefruit, orange, peach, lemon, a beautiful, albeit bitter, fruit bouquet. Texture's tasty, body's light/medium, finish is quite delicious and lasting,. Overall, an exceptional overboard IPA!  My tiny complaint, though this is a brew that I sample and enjoy every year, like all beer lovers, is that it's character doesn't offer much than you'd imagine of a super-hoppy IPA. When I think of seasonal wintertime beers, I expect something darker, with extra flavors, suitable to the chilly days we have have to endure. (At least, those of us who have winter...). It's a pity they don't release this year 'round as an IPA, as that's the only staple missing from their portfolio.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,GreatPondBrewer,3.48,"This is a good beer, but not something that I would necessarily drink lots of on a cold winter night as it is designed for. The look is really good, with a nice deep, golden hue with a creamy, white head. The smell had nice fruity flavors and I was excited to drink it. the first taste was a bit of a let down. It came on much too bitter and the fruit flavors were way too citrusy for me. It did have a nice hop finish, and I must admit the further down the glass I got the better it tasted. I might try this again, this time letting it warm up for another 5-10 minutes, but I have had better IPA's.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Pegasus,4.5,"Appearance: Deep golden orange color with a vast off-white cloud-top head and an abundance of carbonation. Lots of thick and sticky lace coats the glass walls.  Aroma: Aroma of bitter orange, pine sap, very prominent medicinal hops, and lots of spices.  Taste: Tasting yields devastatingly strong hops, riding beneath is a wave of smooth malt. Alcohol is prominent in the taste and quite warming. Towards the finish pine sap flavors appear, providing a counter-play to the hop bitterness. Finish is very smooth with a touch of lingering bitter orange peel.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy.  Drinkability/notes: An absolutely superb beer; one that mere words are hard pressed to justify.  Presentation: Packaged in a stubby twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass.

140,1904,Admiraldinty,3.88,"Amber in appearance with abundant frothy head. Hops are quite evident in nose along with spiciness. Taste has obvious hoppiness and spiciness (somewhat herbal). I could not really detect anything fruity about this, although others have mentioned a subtle fruitiness. In all honesty, I wasn't terribly big on the taste. I like hops, but this was a bit overpowering. Although, it went pretty well with some spiciness food. Very warming - no wonder this is for the winter. Mouthfeel was surprisingly smooth. Drinkable enough, although I wouldn't drink too much of this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,avylover,4.67,"My friend had a keg of this brew for his birthday a few years ago and I've been hooked ever since. I had to wait until I could sit down with one in front of the PC to give an honest review, else bias would have made this an all 5s brew... Pours a nice golden/ruby color with a small head that dies quick. Scent is all malt and hops. If you like hops, you'll love this brew. Right away the hops explode in your mouth, nice & raw, with the sweet malt there to balance it out. Spicy citrousy notes. One thing that makes this one of my favorite christmas brews is the fact it's not too spicy like some other american breweries that seem to go over the top with strange,unidentifiable spices. This brew is great malty taste + tons of hops. Hops linger in the mouth for awhile after a swig. I could drink this all night (and have on occasion). A great brew, one of my favorites regardless of style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,elmocoso,4.42,"I finally scored a sixer of this last night at the whole foods in Thousand Oaks, Ca. Home of Darva Conger from who wants to marry a millionare. That, though, will have no barring on my review - what-so-ever. The slot for the sixers was empty and i had to ask the guy behind the cheese counter to check in back. There were 2 six packs left, and if i wasn't a poor, out-of-work college boy, i would have splerged for both of them.  Now, for the review.  This glorious beer pours a deep carmel color, with a tight off-white head that dissipates into a very thick ring around the glass, and some slightly active surface lace. The head does kick back up when the beer is swurreled to release aroma. aaaahhh, and the aroma...  an excelent, and fully ritch and well ballanced aroma off of this one. Lots and lots of citrus-flowery aroma and a very present malt smell - together these attributes form on of the best aromas of any beer. Nose candy, for sure.  When drunken straight out of the fridge, the hops seem blunt and over powering, but after leaving the beverage on the counter for a 5 or 10, the maltyness peeks its head out and the bitterness forms itself into the perfect sharp acompanyment - resulting in a great sipping nectar.  The mouthfeel is definatly ritch and well rounded, and the overall drinkablity is great.

140,1904,BeerGlassesCollector,3.98,SN Celebration Ale 2002: Slightly different from the other strong hopped character beers i've tried so far. I am not a big fan of hopped beers but i found this one a bit different and more balanced. It pours a cloudy light brown/reddish colour topped by a thick head that settles down rather easily. Flavour and aroma are dominated by hops but this Ale is very well balanced. The taste is not that bitter as i would expect from a strong hopped beer. Quality seasonal brew...,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,UncleJimbo,4,"I sampled a 12 oz amber bottle with 1998 on the neck label. I could find no ""bottled on"" date on this bottle.  This ale poured to give a coppery colored, cloudy beer with very thin white foam that left nice lace on the glass. The aroma was interesting with the dominant aroma from barley and malt, but with some odor of hops and apples. The taste was dominated by hops - sharp and almost acrid with some fruitiness and spicy oakiness. There was a lingering aftertaste of bitter hops. The mouthfeel was smooth with a strong hop bitterness throughout but with a mild sweetness in the finish. The carbonation was moderate. The drinkability was good for this clean and crisp IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,NeroFiddled,4.45,"With so many reviews available it would seem stupid for me to add my standard analysis. I would, however, like to simply note what makes this beer as good as it is. The hazy borderline-copper body is quite welcoming, but it's the magnificent creamy head that holds all the way through the glass that clearly shows how well made it is. The beautiful lace throughout the entire glass also adds to its majestic appearance - it's almost as if it were a nitro-beer! The beautifully fresh nose expresses an herbal, citrusy and spicy character that's as if you'd just stuck your nose into a bag of fresh hop flowers! But it doesn't stop there; a juicy underlying fruitiness from the yeast adds to its vibrancy. The body is light enough to be highly drinkable, but also full enough to combine with the very fine natural carbonation giving it an exceptionally smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The flavor, like the aroma, is dripping with fresh floral and citrusy hop character - but it's not so bold that it's over-powering or minty. Instead, it's delicately balanced against a softly sweet, nutty and bready caramel-soaked maltiness that emphasises the hops. It showcases the soft, and almost sweet character of the Cascade hops! Balance is what this beer is all about, and it's bitterness is no exception. It's not intense (which would ruin the palate and overshadow it's supple maltiness, but it is quite solid and becomes drying in the finish. It pushes and pulls throughout the pint but never becomes the centerpiece. Finesse, not bravado, wins the prize here!!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,kelticblood,3.86,"2002 celebration ale- What an exceptional pour! The head was so huge I had to sip the foam twice so it wouldnt overflow a 20oz glass.The color is a cloudy orange-red color.The aroma is of hops..alot of them.The head dissolved into thick white clumps of foam like an ice cream milkshake.Tons of thick sticky white lace everywhere.The taste presented a creamy full bodied and very hoppy Ale.The mouthfeel tasted a bit flat.Lacked a crisp carbonated texture.Very smooth and silky with a long bitter grapefruit finish.I never tried this before and was expecting something else.Being a winter brew and named ""celebration Ale"" I thought it would be a bit hearty and thick with a higher ABV,but it turned out to be basically an IPA..Which is not my choice to fight off a cold winter's night..I can only rate this on being an IPA and not a true winter brew.  2nd review: After 2 Years of aging a Celebration Ale it has developed great carbonation with tons of bubbles rising up.Very bitter mouthfell and finish.A fine white lace with a swirling haziness.The color is a dark orange to light brown.Mouthfeel is not watery and has some body to it.Bitterness has overshadowed the hop taste.Aging does change a beer alot.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Dantes,4.38,"Package: Stubby ""heritage"" bottle. No date guidelines. Neck label with blurb notes ""2002 Celebration Ale"" and ""2284"" on lower left poinsettia. Nice winter scene. 6.8% ABV.  Cost: $7.99 6-Pack at Shop-Rite  Presentation: Pint glass at 50º  Appearance: Coppery, strong-tea color. A bit cloudy. Loose, moist white head, settling to about ½&#8221;, remaining for most of the glass. Nice strings of small bubbles from the bottom.  Smell: Hops are very evident with strong lemon peel citrus notes. Spices and malt struggle up through the sharper notes. A bit off-putting at first, but evens out as the head settles. Intriguing.  Taste: More balanced than the aroma. I am not normally a fan of &#8220;overly&#8221; hopped beers, but it works here. Nice hops complexity. I&#8217;m not sophisticated enough to differentiate, but this is not a one-note wonder like many hoppy brews. First bite of hops and citrus are quickly moderated by the malt; notes of clove, allspice, ginger; and fainter hints of raisins, plums, and grapefruit. Clean and edgy without being sharp.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is well-matched to the fullness of the brew. Comparable to the Winter Solstice, with more body and viscosity.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. ABV is virtually undetectable and the body and flavors are both light and satisfying. I can see this both for savoring and as a regular quaffer.  In general, I&#8217;m not a big fan of very hopped beers. For me, it is the equivalent of salt or Habanero peppers. I love them, but used injudiciously, they dominate. Here, the Sierra Nevada succeeds. Its elements are well orchestrated, even with a heavy weighting on the hops end of the scale. Like a string quartet where the &#8216;cello dominates, the imbalance works if Yo-Yo Ma is the cellist, but would be a disaster otherwise. This works.  Backwash: This review is a tale of two Winter Seasonals. Compared to Anderson Valley&#8217;s Winter Solstice, this brew wins hands down. My tastes don&#8217;t run to the &#8220;hop-head&#8221; end of the spectrum, but the execution of the Celebration Ale is great. I&#8217;m a big fan of Winter Seasonals and would add this my list of favorites, although less ""wintery"" than many. I still lean to the maltier British offerings, but this is an excellent change of pace. Should be made available year-round. If it mellows with age as noted below, could be perfect.  NB: Had on draught, this WAS mellower and even better.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,SchmichaelJ,4.53,"2002: I've grown a strong liking for hoppy ales lately, and I was very, very satisfied upon drinking the Celebration Ale. From the bottle, it poured a nice, dark orange / brown color. A beautiful full head stood atop the glass, and was very well-retained throughout. Complex and tight lacing was also present, and I'd have to describe its overall appearance as creamy and full on top, sharp and mellow below. A luxurious hop aroma was present, and a nice spiciness added to the wonderful smell. A very pronounced hop bitterness was noticed in the taste, along with a subtle and pleasant maltiness. The higher alcohol presence was noted but not intrusive...most welcome, in fact, on this cold December night. A full, creamy mouthfeel was cut sharply by the prickly carbonation and felt great in the mouth. Overall, the Celebration Ale has been one of the best brews I've tasted since I began seriously reviewing beer. It's a great seasonal brew, and will very likely accompany my holiday celebrations for years to come.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cretemixer,4.08,"Pours the color of fallen leaves, browns, reds and burnt orange hues all mingle together.

140,1904,purplehops,4.18,"Based on 2002 bottling. Celebration poured a sparkling copper red with a rich off-white head that clings to the sides of the pint. The aroma is pure hops with some backgrand odors of malt. The taste starts crisp and clean with malt flavors up front and then fades into citrus and coriander like flavors with hop spiciness and bitterness making their presence known in the finish. The aftertaste is a well balanced blend of carmel malt sweetness and the hop bitterness. The two flavors continue to undulate on your palate. The mouthfeel is pleasantly full with slight carbonation and alcohol tickles. Another fine example of an American IPA. It gives warmth to your body, pleasure to your eyes, and spicy hop aromas for your olfactory.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Mitchster,4.42,"Brewed with Two-row Pale & English Caramel. Hopped with Chinook for bittering, Finished with Cascade and Centennial, and dry hopped with Cascade and Centennial. 6.8% ABV, OG=16.0p, FG=4.0p, 65 IBU's.  A thick, meringue head forms atop a crystal clear deep copper/ruby liquid. The initial aroma is *wham*..grapefruit in bushels! If one concentrates, you can also detect a little alcohol escaping from those tiny bubbles. Head forms a nice brussels lace and stay with the beer until you're done. Bittering hops are well balanced to the sweetness and body of the malt, and finishes with strong hops bitterness and sugar cookies. Excellent mouthfeel...nice and chewy. Comparing the bottled version to draught of the same year, I would say that the draught had a thinner head, a somewhat milder hop profile (i.e.-a little more rounded and smooth), and had less bitter hop finish, which in my opinion made the draught more enjoyable. A great beer, and one I look forward to each year. If you like this, try Bell's Two-Hearted Ale. Get both on tap if you can!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,putnam,4.13,"""2002""... Great brilliant reddish brass color. Freshly whipped head. The aromas are dominated by grapefruit with some cinnamon candy and toasted hazelnuts for background music. On the palate it's solidly hoppy (grapefruit) with slow, silky, rivulets of light caramel syrup raining down afterwards. Cured, dried herb is the theme here though. Feels like I'm working in a hop mine, taking a break to eat ruby red grapefruit...herb smoke afterwards.

140,1904,BitteBier,4.62,"Pours a very attractive, not-quite-clear amber orange. Active carbonation feeds a substantial foamy, light head that dissipates rather quickly but laces quite impressively down the side of the glass. Even when well-chilled, this beer has a strong, wonderful nose--very crisp and hoppy with some sweet fruit notes as well. Hops are omnipresent in the taste, muted at the start by soft fruitiness and by some dryness at the end.

140,1904,mrjimcat,4.42,"The beer when poured exhibited a generous lasting head. The aroma was hoppy with a sweet background. The predominant characteristic is the hop bitterness and flavor.

Major floral hop in the nose and five star general floral and bittering hops in the palate. To say that Sierra Nevada 2002 Celebration Ale is well hoped would be doing it an injustice. The 6.8% alcohol by volume then takes over the mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach, with a plesant after glow. Aftertaste is a persistant plesent bitter, that lasts and lasts.

It comes in a very festively labelled squat 12 fl.oz brown bottle, with a picture of a Dickensian snow covered wooden log cabin, which no doubt never existed, decorating the obverse. It does look good though, it fooled me and Im a Scrooge. F**k you Bob Cratchet. Has a huge off-white cream colored head, massively dominant that leaves a great smattered lace look on the walls of the glass. The beer pours with a deep-orangey brown light chestnut color that is totally clear and lucid, luminescent against an illuminated background, it looks simply resplendent. With the huge rocky foamy off-white head comprised of a myriad of contemporary sized bubbles, this beer really does look like the Dogs Bollocks. Bitterness announces its dominance in a way that the school bully elected to have the best locker at school, unquestioned and unchallenged, until the little petite child favourite stood up and questioned him. When he did, everyone ganged-up on the bully - flavour hence rears his head and challenges this bitter brute to a show down. Just as in life, its not fair, bully boy bitterness wins hands down and bloodies the nose of fair play and integrity. The aromas are of an egalitarian Captain hoppiness, First Mate bitterness lingers in the back of the nasal passage. This beer makes no bones about its intentions. Kick Ass Hops and Bitterness. The freshly mown and harvested hop smells punctuate the two nostrils as the beer enters the aural cavities and politically announces Vote Hops with fascist tendencies. Belligerent bitterness introduces this Ale with militaristic precision. Celebrate the end of year with Hummulus Luppulus, forget the fallacy of that fat bastard Father Christmas, the red nosed white bearded pseudo bringer of joy, I stopped believing in years ago  for only this Ale can do that without any false modesty.

140,1904,Viking,4.57,"Clear red-amber body, with a nice cream-colored head. Head is rather short-lived, but a bit of lace stays atop the brew and clings to the side of the glass. Grapefruit citrus and a solid presence of the deep pine forest dominate the smell. A bit of caramel malt noticeable as well. Rich, wonderfully hoppy and bitter flavor - but not overwhelming, by any means. The citrus flavor dominates most of the way, but the herbal, piney taste takes over in the finish. Nice mellow caramel malt backs up this excellent IPA. Incredibly smooth brew, went very well with a nice rare sirloin.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Riggo,4.47,"Once again, Sierra pulls off another great balancing act, managing to produce a warming, holiday brew while staying true to their signature west coast hoppy style.  This ale pours a beautiful rust, honey, orange color with a creamy off-white head. Scents of pine, spicy hops, and grapefruit dominate. The taste is of spicy, ""gritty"" hops with notes of caramel, apple and citrus, especially grapefruit. A buttery mouthfeel and backnotes of nut, wood, allspice?, nutmeg? The richer, spicier ""holiday"" taste elements are all beautifully tamed and balanced with bitter hops in what is essentially an IPA. Probably the ultimate hophead holiday beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,Bierman9,4.33,"My first celebration in a long time, and first time bottle-wise. A deep, rich, copper colored bier sits beneath a frothy, fine, tan head. Lacing is excellent...looks real good in the glass!! Nose has a robust, citrusy (Cascade?) hop twang. I like it, much more so than some biers that have mild, subdued nose that you really have to search for. Body came in at a medium-grade, as well as the smoothness, also a medium-grade. There is a good combo of malt and hops; about 1/3 malt to 2/3 hops, imo. The malt is underlying and toffee-like, to some extent. The hops are citrusy and gutsy. A good whack, though very pleasurable, to the palate!! Zum Wohl!!  overall: 4.35 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4.5  426",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,cokes,4.52,"Cloudy orange liquid with a hefty, pale yellow froth. Nose is very all about the hops. Piney and citric. Though not as much as past years? Taste is similar. Pine sap, resin, pine twigs and bark and roots all mixed together in a grapefruity punch. The hops here are equally juicy and bitter. Toasted caramel backbone. Nothing truly noteworthy, but definately sufficient. Amidst all the hop carnage, There is an upswelling of cherry near the close as pricks of brandied alcohol dot the finish. Bitterness is deep and lingering. Smooth and creamy in the mouth. Glides across the tongue to slowly assassinate braincells. Literally poundable. One to be careful with. Very good stuff...stands with Sasquatch as my fav SN product.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Zraly,4.32,"A hop head's dream for a winter brew.  A huge head left the bottle, accompanied by a super-strong pine scent. The color was almost a dark, golden-orange.  The flavor of this ale is huge! It does not merely linger along, it asserts itself with full force. There is a raw flavor and smell underlying the hoppiness...a super floral presence. I even pick up a flavor of iron. Interesting and an exciting beer for the senses to experience.  The malt is definately a side note. The main feature is the hops. I highly recommend this warmer for a nice, red meat dinner.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,doerickson,3.65,"Mahogany/deep ruby red appearance with a small fine white head. Big aromas of piney hops with some toasty malts as well. Medium carbonation; fairly big body. Taste of piney, citrusy Cascade hops with some grapefruity character, offset to some extent by a sweet caramel/brown sugar malty profile, particularly as the brew warms. A bit unbalanced towards the hop end for my taste, especially for a winter seasonal, but undoubtedly worth a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Lupe,4.33,"This is a woderful Christmas present for hop lovers.  Pours a hazy amber color with a thick, rocky, off-white head that leaves sticky lace all the way down the glass. Aroma is hops all the way, herbal and citrus with some spice in the backround. Medium to full bodied with an incredible creamy mouthfeel. Taste starts off with lbig with hops, a bit hard to handle at the beginning, but don't give up on it. After the first sip or two, you get used to the barrage of fresh hop flavors, and the chewy malt comes through along with a hint of spice. Very good drinkablility for the amount of hops and the amount of alcohol.  Not balanced at all, but it is damn tastey. At once I was not fond of high hop brews, but this one has changed my mind. And you have to love the scene on the bottle!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,AtrumAnimus,3.5,My expectations were a bit high for this beer. The hop blend is ok. The 2001 was better. This one is lacking in maturity. The initial taste is very good. However the second half as it rolls past the palate is not a clean finish and is rough. Almost a bit of a ugh factor. Reminds me of a more mature version of the Arogant Bastard. Nice Seasonal - but needs more seasoning.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,brakspear,3.9,"A perfect winter holiday beer for the west coast hophead in all of us.  2002 Review  The beer pours a slightly hazy chestnut/amber body with a fantastic rocky head that reduces to a creamy cap on top of the beer below.  The aroma is pure and explosive Centennial/Cascade hops, surrounding and dominating the malt below, but with no harshness.  The taste is scouring from the Chinook hop base, but a full-flavored malt chewiness breaks through at times as well. Not balanced, but who says all beers must be.  I am glad this Celebration Ale makes its way to the Middle West.  5-22-2003  Reviewed again after a comparison to some of the other hophead westcoast beers and it does not hold up as well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,aracauna,4.12,"Deep amber, thick head is pockmarked. Nose is huge. Floral, citic hops over a crip toasty malt. Flavor: Grapefruit and pine sap hops, tingly, Crisp maltiness. Butter and flower nectar. Damn good. Much better than the regular Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HopheadEd,4.4,"I like everything about this ale. Big nose, big head that lasts with ample lacing. Spicy taste followed by a smooth, very drinkable body, not overly carbonated. Of course the traditional big hoppy finish that is the Sierra trademark. One of my favorite seasonals.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,IrishRedRock,4.05,"2003 vintage-- sampled 12-2-03 -- Seems pretty similar to me as the '02, though a bit less carbonated, resulting in less head retention, and the aroma seems to come out a little less than last year's. Same delightful spicy hops. Is the alcohol more pronounced in this bottle? Sure seems like it to me. I've got quite a few aging. This should be interesting, and very tasty, down the road.   2002 vintage -- A fantastic offering from Sierra Nevada. Deep copper color with a rocky head that lasts straight on through til morning. A bit of hops are present in the aroma, and balance nicely with the citrus and mild spice.  This brew is ever so smooth. Hoppiness and maltiness blends well and hits at the same time. Spice is mild, I could have used maybe a little more to give me some additional holiday cheer, but the 6.8% ABV warmed me nicely. An excellent seasonal!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BillyBrew,4.58,"I was eager to try this one out, and it exceeede my expectations.  A sexy, nutty-amberish colour with a rocky/chunky creamy-head that stays thick and leaves heavy rings throughout. The nose was chock-full o' hops; oils, flowers and leaves. Some rindy-citrus and a hardy crystaly-malt sweeten the nose a shade. This brew is more tasey-hop than strikingly bitter. All the strong hop-oils, and to the lesser, hop flowers are vibrant and present upfront. Although not balanced, the grain malts try to carry the hop burden. The malt adds a slight sweetness that cuts the bitterness some. Very solid medium, nearly heavy body that has a soft but present carbonation.  Something like this reminds me why IPA/heavy-hops were my first love. The power and presence of the hops head-off a perfect drinkability score as this brew is not one for easy/lazy drinking. The brew requires your attention. Snatch this brew up before the seasnos change. Enjoy, repeat! Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Jon,4.65,"Exactly like what you would expect for an IPA from Sierra Nevada. An excellent offering each winter, this one pours a glowing copper color with a very frothy head that lasts infinitely. Aroma is mainly of citric, piney hops. Taste is similar, with a huge hoppy profile that's balanced quite well with a thorough malt character. Mouthfeel is pretty good, maybe a little carbonated. For an ale of 6.8% ABV, I find this to be an easy drinker for sure. I, too, am all for this as a year-round offering from SN. There's always something to celebrate, right?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MJR,4.5,"Appearance: Beautiful orange/copper with a nice, off-white head that sticks pretty well.  Smell: Aroma of cascade hops: grapefruit, pine, and a slight floral note. Great nose on this beer!  Taste: Has a good malt background, but this brew's all about the hops! Despite this, there's still of good balance of flavor. This is beer with cascade hops done right. Does a great job of arousing the appetite.  Mouthfeel: Pretty good for the style. Light to light/medium body. Sits more to the dry side. Nice...  Drinkability: Very high if you're a hop-head. If not, stay away because the incredible flavor will only come across as blinding bitterness.  This is my first year trying this brew and I must say that I'm quite impressed. It's like their fantastic Pale Ale, but taken to the next level. I'll look forward to this next year...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jward,4.48,"The label's quaint scene of a snow-covered cabin works well in announcing the themes of winter and Celebration, reflecting feelings of warmth, safety and comfort. The beer pours amber, with a creamy white head. A sharp nose, with strong elements of citrus, suggests an impending hops explosion. Hops, hops and more hops. Even at the finish a bitter hops flavor lingers, as elements of grapefruit and pine recede, but in a way that is inviting, rather than overwhelming. With a full mouthfeel and nice carbonation, this is a big beer, appropriate for a big and festive holiday season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mjohn27603,4.12,"Amber in appearance. The aroma is wonderful smells of citrusy hops with a slight piney smell. Well, I'm not reporting anything different from other reviewers when I describe the taste as hoppy. I would agree that it is more a taste of hops without a ton of bitterness. Not as bitter as other IPA's I've had. I did get a very subtle orange taste on a few sips. I got this one in the store from the refrigerator plus the 2002 on the label so at least it wasn't sitting out for a while. A pretty good brew but I guess I'm a little puzzled by all the fuss. Maybe it is narrow mindedness on my part but it also doesn't match what I was expecting out a winter offering. I don't penalize the beer for that.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,MaineBeerMan,4.8,"Amber orange color with a big head of white foam that leaves a curtain of sticky lace. Big aroma of grapefruit rind with a bit of a piney character from the abundant hops. Flavor comes on all bittersweet and seemingly well balanced, then the malt fades and the hops really take over. Hop flavor is fruity and citrusy more than bitter,with a super long drying finish. This stuff tastes like an Anchor Liberty on steroids. An awesome beer, I can see why it is so highly rated, must get more before it dissapears from the stores.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,astrobrewer,4.17,"It poured yellow-amber and very clear, but seemed to get a little cloudy as it warmed in my glass. The head seemed coarse, with large-ish bubbles rather than a smooth white foam. All of that is secondary to the aroma. Hops. Lots of 'em. Heavy duty pine and citrus aroma slaps you in the face. The hops are also very evident in the flavor, but the the beer is more hop-flavor than just bitter. Not what I expected from a holiday brew, but overall it is an enjoyable beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Winter,3.37,"Poured copper in color with an off-white head. Bubbles seen rising through the semi-cloudy liquid. Aroma consisted of hops and sweet fruit. Good carbonation hits the tongue right away followed by the a strong hopiness of this full-bodied brew. A bit of malt in there too and a very bitter, salty finish . A great beer for those who love hops. It also made me realize that not all winter seasonals have to be heavily spiced and sweet.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jackndan,3.88,"Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale: Very hoppy aroma, very little spice. Fairly surprising for a holiday beer. Reddish brown color, with a slightly off-white head. The aroma and taste is very much, too much, hops. In fact, but for a slight citrus taste at the end, its hardly a holiday beer at all. Very Very nice beer, not much of a holiday beer though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Thrasher,3.69,"Great, and overrated. Hazy reddish gold with huge dense head. Aroma is the weak point; smells like spoiled milk to me. Tart, piney hops are all you need to know here. Like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale except bigger. Malt character is solid but almost beside the point. Good for sitting by the fire on Christmas Eve with friends and family and getting comfortably smashed. A fine beer, flawed, whose esteem has risen largely because of limited availability.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bmills1608,4.1,"Head was slightly off white with hints of green, this beer is heavily hopped and even the color of the head is an indicator. Color was orange-amber. Nose was citrus and lots of it, grapefruit to be specific, and very spicy-zesty.  Taste is the prototypical in your face cascades explosion and there are lots of them for sure. The initial taste is packed with hops and is crunchy hard, very nice indeed. Mid palate and finish contains a smoldering bitterness as the spicy citrus fades slowly. Malt flavors are definitely in the background but are just ample enough to not be totally overwhelmed by the hop muscle. I did not realize this beer was an IPA, I initially thought it was a spiced winter warmer.  Sierra really works the Cascades well with this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,maxpower,4.5,"Pours dark copper color, foamy head, citrus hoppy aroma. Medium-Full bodied and unfilterd, thick head leaves a nice lace in the glass.

140,1904,johnrobe,4.82,"2002 edition. What a marvelous brew!! Admittedly, I'm a hop-head and this beer does not disappoint. Hops, hops and more hops in the aroma (of the signature citric/floral Pacific Northwest varieties). Dark orange amber with a cream colored head that sticks around. Hops dominate the palate with lovely grapefruit and floral flavors which are pleasantly bitter. Delicious sweet bready malt (like Hawaiian sweetbread) comes up for support around mid-palate but quickly gives way to...you guessed it....the hops in the finish. But they are such lovely, complex, well integrated, mouthwatering hops. Mmmm!!  7/4/03: I stocked up on '02 Celebration and it's been a real pleasure to see how it ages. The brash, overt hoppiness of new SN Celebration is still evident but has settled down and is now wonderfully balanced with the malt. I continue to be impressed with this brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Murph,4.7,"Yummy, I've got to make sure that I get some more of this stuff before it is all gone for the year. Beautiful copper beer with a big white sticky head and great acing and ringing down the glass. Nice piney and citrusy/floral hop aromas dominate. Quick hop bite right at the start of the brew before it turns into some nice mellow malt through the middle before the fruity hoppy flavors take over and the beer eventually finishes with a nice lingering hop bitterness. Smooth and tangy with a decently heavy body that is appropriate for the season. I'm tempted to run out and buy more of this right now. I'm definitely going to put some of it away so that I can enjoy it as the year goes by.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,CharlesRiver,4.42,Pours a golden amber with a nice white fluffy head. The smell is hops all the way. Well balanced beer that has that warming affect as you drink more. Lots of little bubbles that dance in your mouth. I can't find one part of this beer that stands out too much or over powers another flavor. My two favorite parts are the smell and the aftertaste. I will have to get more of this.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,HossMcGraw,5,"2001 Vintage Sweet mother of god! This is the ambrosia I have been seeking. Fresh Celebration was always in my top 10, but an aged version... I think I need a change of underwear. Appearance is a deep golden amber with a large white head and perfect lacing. The aroma is sheer bliss. Sierra Nevada should make a cologne that smells like this. The taste: Complex malts, honey, cinnamon, clove, and the best goddamn hop flavor I've ever experienced. This is perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel is smooth enough to bed the queen of England, and the drinkakbility: too good to be true. If you've never had an aged Celebration, I can tell you that's it's a completely different beer. The only way this beer could possibly improve is by aging it another year or so.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Morris729,4.1,"After hearing so many people rave about this beer, I was finally able to get my hands on a 6-pack, and I have to say that if you like hops, you will enjoy this brew. It pours a medium amber color with a massive creamy head. The strong scent of hops struck me as I was pouring the beer. Once in the glass, some fruit scents were notably mixed with the hops. The taste is a bit sweet and spicy with a strong hop blast on the back of the tongue. A very nice beer for the winter season!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,doho95fu,4.2,"2002 Version - Everyone has mentioned the hops in this beer, but to me it was REALLY hoppy. I'm a borderline hophead so I was neither pleased or displeased with my own reaction. The beer was a copper haze with an off white head. There was good lacing. The smell immediately signals hops, but there was a citrus hint as well. The flavor, as I said before, is hoppy with a citrus and spice flavor. I think maybe there was less of the spicyness than in other holiday brews - good for me. I did not notice any real alcohol kick, just the average IPA alcohol. Overall, a good beer.  Something about the bottle with the red cap just reminds me of the holidays.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BeerBuilder,4.23,"2002 Edition  This was the Celebration Ale brewed for the 2002 season. The beer poured to a beautiful amber/copper color with a creamy off-white head that lasts. With each sip a nice lace-work forms on the side of the glass. The nose is one of a floral and spicey bitterness. When sipped you get a blast of spicey, floral hop flavor with a note of maltiness in the background. The finish is dry, with a bit of alcoholic warmth. Overall, this is a very tastey brew with the hop aroma and flavor more than outweighing the malt characteristics. 2003 Edition  Pours to a brilliant copper-orange color with a creamy tan head. The aroma is of fresh, juicy citrus hops, with a nice, soft malt backbone. The flavor is fruity, citrusy and spicy with the malt taking backstage. It is bitter from beginning to end, with the bitterness sticking with you through each sip. It is a full-bodied, bitter brew. A definite yearly favorite.  sampled 11/26/03",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mzwolinski,4.57,"Dark orange, light amber in color with a thin head. The aroma is of delicate spices. Big whiffs of cascade hops, but these are balanced out by a nice orange citrus which makes itself known as the beer warms. Flavor is spicy and once again the hops are very noticeable up front. Mid-palate is dominated by a nutmeggy malt sweetness and a mild alcohol warming, folllowed by a significant hop bitterness. Dry finish with a good spice aftertaste. Very drinkable indeed!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,yen157,4.13,"Poured deep copper in color with a resonable nice fine, sticky, off-white head and a little chill haze. Smelled of malt, yeast, and a nice piney, floral hops. Also, some pineapple in the nose. I was impressed by the complexity of the hops in this one. As far as tastes go, the first flavor was a big, bitter mouthful. This was followed by bread crust, and a tiny bit of salt at the very end. Because of the dominance of hops, there is a lingering bitterness and ""hop burps"".  I finally was able to find this SN beer by me. I've been looking forward to the season and the beer for some time to see if it lived up to the hype. I'm sad to say, IMVHO, that it did not. Don't get me wrong, it was quite a good beer. I am definately seeking this one out in the future. I'm just not going to set up a shrine in its honor. My biggest problem was with the mouthfeel. In terms of style, the mouthfeel was flawless. However, since it is packaged as a winter brew I feel it falls short of the mark. Two things could be done to correct this. The first is give it a finer carbonation. The second is increase the final gravity. IMO, the carbonation is too coarse, or the body a bit too thin, for a ""winter warmer"".",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ADR,3.91,"2002 edition...  Slightly hazy dark orange color, plenty of head that holds rocky shapes and laces well. Bright spicy orange aromas, hops influenced. This baby is hopped like a maniac, the agreeable malt has slight nutmeg qualities but seems overrun early and often by the hops all the way to the aftertaste. Just too unbalanced for my expectations of a winter brew (unless X-mas in California means IPA), lots of similarities to some other up and coming juicy American IPAs. But, a cool addition to your arsenal of winter brews, I can certainly be in the mood for this as there are definite times I crave hops. Much more gutsy than SN Pale...maybe they should run this all year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,freed,4.67,"My mouth started watering when I read the name of this ale. I admit I've got a 'thing' for hops, but this is a wonderful example of a full bodied ale with strong hops. I'm not sure if this is considered a seasonal, but its my favorite of the bunch. Its like having a great winter beer and a great IPA. Great for drinking outside during the winter.  addendum: market found 10 cases hidden, so its on sale. Seems extra good compared to the lagers I've had lately",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,1904,marc77,4.62,"Copper hue w/ good clarity. Persistant ivory white head leaves Belgian lace. An assertive, pungent combination of a citrusy cascade and piney hops hit the nose immediately, then are ceded by medium caramel and hints of rich, pleasant butterscotch. Although the hop bitterness is quite assertive, the rich malt character isn't overshadowed, and toasty malt and well integrated, deep caramel provide a firm malt backbone to support the hops. Hop flavor mirrors the hop nose, and is both citrusy and piney, but when coupled with malt sweetness, could be perceived as sweetly spruce like. Moderately bodied, w/ a dextrinous, full mouthfeel. Fruity esters, although subdued, emerge late and provide additional complexity. Finishes w/ a delectable lingering combination of crisp hop bitterness and mild caramel sweetness. Tongue coating bready grain is perceptible upon exhaling. This years Celebration (2002) retains the hop profile of previous years, but the malt profile seems to possess greater depth and richness. Simply put, it's one of the greatest American IPAs around. Who needs spices in a winter brew, when spicy aromatics can be acheived with hops? It's a beautiful beer, especially when consumed at cellar temps or above.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,hyuga,4.85,"Just picked up the first 2002 six pack of this sold by my local specialty grocery store, and with great anticipation, I cracked one open. Huge frothy head over an amber-brown brew. Head retains very well and leaves lace as the glass empties. Powerful hop aroma, mostly citrus, a bit spicy. Hints of sweet caramel malt. Wonderful! On the palate, bitter and spicy hops take the lead with malt struggling behind in the beginning, but showing itself more as more is consumed. Deeper in, more complex hop character comes through showing the variety used in hopping this beer. Citrus, oil, and fruit are all present. Malt backs all of this up very well with grain and caramel sweetness. Spicy and grain dry finish. This isn't what I would normally expect from a winter brew, but surprisingly, it fits with the season very well. The spicy hop character gives it that winter holiday feel. This is what I want to drink with Thanksgiving dinner. Insanely drinkable for a winter brew as well. This is an exceptional ale that goes beyond even high expectations, the perfect companion all through the winter!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BeerManDan,4,First of all I was not overly impressed with this beer. It poured a golden brown and had no foam. The aroma had a faint floral smell and that was it. The bitterness of this beer over powered my palate and I couldn't detect any outstanding flavor in this beer. Tried it again and raised my rating by .5. I didn't get it so cold this time. Warmer is better!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mickeymac,4.42,"It's here: 2002 edition. It pours a pretty golden-red with a somewhat bubbly off-white head. The trademark Sierra hops are definitely in there, but the smell isn't by any means overwhelming. In fact, the hops seem almost subtle for an SN beer. Notes of citrus abound, with a definite undercurrent of yeasty/bready flavors. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light and almost fizzy on the tongue. Despite its 6.8% abv and a definite warming quality, it doesn't want to go down like a sipping beer. I'm going to have a hard time keeping away from the remainder of the six-pack. Welcome winter!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,aaronh,4.38,"This is a light chestnut colored beer that has a slight reddish hue and amber highlights. It pours with a nice, solid head that really covers the glass with lace and exhibits excellent head retention. The aroma is of malt and floral hops, with a hint of spices. The front end of the taste is sweetness with a strong hop finish. The hops seem to be very much in keeping with Sierrs Nevada's style. It has a very smooth mouthfeel, and drinks quite easily. I feel fortunate to have found and enjoyed this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,allboutbierge,4.65,"Compared this to an Anchor Special Ale at the same time. This won though the Anchor was wonderful as well. Sensational mouthfeel: very silky, smooth, and luxurious tasting (the mouthfeel of this beer is like the ride of a Mercedes). Leaves attractive lace on glass and maintains a slightly foamy top through the whole beer. Alluring color of Mahogany amber and cloudy. Taste is herb and spice filled. Strong hops, bitter but not all that overpowering. Very complex. Can't picture drinking more than two of these though. Very enjoyable beer and will be awaiting this years version.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RBorsato,5,"Deep Copper to Reddish Bronze. Huge Citrusy Aroma and Big Citrus Hop Flavor. High Bitterness but solid malt backing for good balance. Medium Bodied leaning to the Full side and very smooth.  This review was based on the 2001 Version. One of my favorite American Style IPAs - I buy at least 2 cases each year -- DRINK it fresh as it goes downhill after about 9 months. Still not bad but loses a good bit of it's citrusy hoppiness.  I have had the 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 versions.  ===  Update: 03/13/05 Linear Tasting: Tasted 01, 02, 03 and 04 with much the same results - drink fresh!! Older versions did not go bad but hops were subdued to the point of having the Celebration Ale turn into a light English Barleywine... If that's what you like just buy a good BW instead of bothering with aging.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jreitman,4.4,Incredibly great color with an enticing aroma. Malt flavors are quite noticeable dominated mostly by nuts and some caramel. Hops also show themselves through some nice citrus undertones. The alcohol gives the beer a nice warming property and does not detract from the other flavors. Very interesting and complex brew that deserves several sessions.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tang214,3.88,"I picked this up one day instead of the usual SN Pale Ale because I hadn't seen it before. I was a bit confused because the label said it was 1999 Celebration Ale, which seems kinda old to be on the shelf. I got it anyways and it turned out to be alright. It has a deep copperish-brown color with a lot of cloudiness. I love the hops that SN uses because it brings out such great aromas. This one even seemed to have some fruity aromas. This taste was good, hoppy and bitter. The drinkability was less than I had initially expected but defeneitly but would make a great brew to drink for the holiday season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,sinistersteve,4.8,"One of the things that make the long, cold, and wet winters here more enjoyable is Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale. I decided to stash a bottle last winter and thought about comparing the 2001 with the 2002 version. Sadly to say it won't happen this year since I'm drinking the 2001 version tonight. It's amazing how well this beer is made. The amber color invites you to consume it's tasty contents, and once you drink it, you are hooked. It's a full flavored beer that does more than its share to keep you warm, even on the coldest of all nights. Also, at 6.8% ABV, it's not something to be played with. Take your time to enjoy the wonderful, malty taste. You'll even notice how much more the flavors stand out when the beer grows to room temperature. With that said, I suspect I'll see the 2002 version on my store shelves in about 3 months and enjoy winter with the best beer of the season.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,jtw5877,4.5,"Pours a copper/orange color with a steady white head,A multitude of hop flavors, enough malt to hold it together plus various spices, One of the reasons I look forward to winter. This was the first holiday brew I have ever sampled, and it pretty much got be back into drinking quality beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,zerk,4.15,"Pours a slightly hazy copper with a pillowy cream colored head that leaves rings of lace on the glass. Aroma is a mixture of bread dough, pine and citrus. Flavor begins with some toasted maltiness, then becomes piney and bitter... very well balanced. Has a rough mouthfeel and a medium body.  Typical strong offering from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,goindownsouth,4.3,Sierra Nevada has done it again with this brew. I was a little skeptical when it was recomended to me by Shangy's (my beer store listed on this site). It is clean and refreshing with a mild aroma of hops. The head is not all too thick and laces nicely by the end of the glass. This is a nice one if you can get your hands on it.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,tigerpaws,4.15,This is a very good beer....the color is very appealing and it has very good taste. The spices were a little to much for my liking but not enough to give this brew anything but a good rating.............CHEERS,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,StevieW,4.88,"Magic in a glass....A great looking orange/reddish color with a nice fluffy white head, bubbles up to the top. Spicy nose, pine, florals, with whiffs of orange peel also hitting the nose. Spicy, bubbly, sticky resin filled hop bubbles fall over the glass. A very appropriate beer for the season. Nice spicy malty flavor paired with the big hop taste makes this one a winner. Creamy rich mouthfeel. Then a bitter hop filled belly warming finish. One of my all time favorites. The only thing I have tasted that comes close in flavor is the Hop Devil, but that is a little more fiery on the spicy hops side. This beer makes you grin from ear to ear and wish for more. As soon as the last sip is down, your are ready for the next one. Great Beer !  2002 Version sampled 11/22/03 Smoother more mellow flavors. Lots of hops still, but the malt undertone is much more noticable.Oily resin flavors match with a hint of slick chocolate flavors. Slightly oily. Very Smooth, rich and mellow. Not as much fresh hop sticky, resin bitterness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,beerluvr,4.7,"Broke out a sixer tonight to see how a five months in the cellar has had on this classic. It pours into the glass with an off-white head...a bit of yeast haze to boot.The nose is predominately malty with a bit of hop in the background. First sip reveals more malt, with a nice long bitter finish. The time spent in the cellar has mellowed out the ""green"" hop attack it has when initially released, but not to worry...it's still kick-ass bitter. I plan to drink the last of the 2001 when the 2002 is out, so I can compare side by side. A holiday classic that should never be missed.  Notes from 2000: Another winner from S.N. Great fresh hop nose when poured into the glass. Wonderful head on this too. Be prepared for a blast of hops on the palate. A loooooonnnnnggggg hoppy finish on this one makes it a world classic, widely copied, look for it!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Bighuge,4.57,Excellent citric?grapefruit notes in aroma. Great hop nose. Nice frothy white head. Beautiful copper color. Nice bite present in this brew. A very good bitterness present. Huge rind characteristics. Very warming. Excellent IPA . Taste good even on the burp.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,RonfromJersey,5,Red amber body with slight chill haze. A rocky head you can sculpt with. Incredible grapefruity hop aroma. Good malt background supporting marvelous hop smack to taste buds. Drinkability? Had a six pack during a party and wanted more that night.  The first nationally available monster of an IPA. I am glad it is seasonal. Keeps me from taking it for granted.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mophie,4.5,"What a treat. It looks terrific in a glass, with a subtle reddish hue. The taste is piney with hints of grapefruit and a touch of spice, though it's better after it's warmed a bit. I've got one left from this season, so I want to wait until the last possible traces of winter before I pop it open. Alas, this has become one of my favorite holiday traditions.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,ThreePistols,2.96,"Orange-amber color, good head with decent lace. Hops, citrus, pine, alcohol aroma. Bitter, hoppy, citrus, pine flavor. Bitter front, med-full body with a high hops middle and a bitter-sweet dry finish. Lingering grapefruit rind and spice aftertaste. IMHO; more malt for better balance and more spice for more flavor. Better character when allowed to warm. Tried it at ice-cold temp, way too bitter. This is a good beer, but it is too bitter and hoppy for my taste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,bk3nj,4.7,"A very hoppy brew; spice hints abound. Very smooth, and easy to drink. Thank god for Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,garymuchow,4.56,"Very nice beer overall, but especially good for a winter warmer. Good steady head, nice color. There is definitely the flavor of grapefruit in the taste, but I guess I like it. It might be hard to drink more than a couple of these.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,AaronRed,4.7,"Hops all the way. Smooth and tasty, with a creamy taste that makes this beer richer than their ales. Not heavy, but hearty.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,proc,4.35,"A fantastic winter beer. Pours smooth to a nice dark brown, almost ruby color with a decent head. Malt is prevelent on the sip and initial mouthfeel, but quickly gives way to a big dose of hops on the finish. A winter warmer sure to please, but in essence, this is a IPA, not really a specialty beer other than the time of year it is released. The log cabin picture on the label beckons you on a cold, fall or winter day. This brewery, overall, brews some of the best, widely available beer in the U.S.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Jordan,4.7,"Many invading flavors here, a bit fruity, a bit flowery, a bit of tarty citrus, and a good kick of hops. It does have a malt edge, but it's the hops that comes through the strongest. Smells like fresh flowers and berries and leaf hops, but not quite as potent as I would really like(big deal huh?). There is a fine sediment floating throughout the glass(gotta love the sediment). Most importantly, this brew is down right delicious...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,John1985,4.6,"Beautiful orange-amber color, intensely fresh hop aroma, Malt stands it ground but the hops edges it out. The flavor of hops roll across the tongue with a pleasant long lasting bitter aftertaste.Surprisingly drinkable. A classic I look forward to every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Todd,4.45,"Balanced? No way. But who gives a rat's ass? 2001 is something to kick the Winter into gear, with its incredible raw hopped character and warming alcohol. A beer to look forward to, regardless. I do recall previous years being more pronounced in the malt dept. and more balanced. But hey, whatever. Drink a few of these and nothing will really matter.  To give this year's a perfect 5 is a little extreme. Everything was great overall, the drinkability ... like crack. I'm off to the pawn shop ...  Notes from 2000:  Presentation: 12oz short brown twist cap bottle. Lovely little X-mas scene on the label. Bottled on date, on neck of bottle.  Appearance: Rich, deep amber/copper. Excellent slightly off-white head ... very creamy, sticky and retains like its fighting for its life.  Smell: There's an absolutely incredible aroma on this beer! A nose full of big herbal hops and fruity esters. Some yeast aromas are also present, but very minimal.  Taste: Dreamy. So smooth. So rich. So fortified with malt goodness. So hoppy. At first there's a creamy feel on the palate, that then opens up to toasty, sweet malt flavours. A bold herbal hop runs rampid on the palate with a semi-prickly, puckering, lemon-rind quality. After a few more mouthfulls the brew begins to warm the body, and you can really feel the alcohol kick in. Finishes a bit dry with grain/husk flavours, and some breadiness as it warms.  Notes: At 6.8% this is one hell of a Winter seasonal! Warms the body and soul. A brew for hop heads too. One of the best Winter Seasonals that I have ever had, and one of the best Strong Ales. Drink with caution as this brew will kick your ass.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,QXSTER1,4.46,"Orangish, red brew with light tan head that laces down the side of the glass. Hops explodes on the palate followed by toasted malts with a citric dry finish. Perfect beer to drink with a holiday meal. Hopheads will love this monster IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,BKotch,4.27,"It got perfect 5's last year and this year, if anything, it's a little smoother. I wonder how that six-pack from last year that I've kept in the back of my pantry (right next to a six of 2001 Big Foot) is faring?  Notes from 2000: If this is November, then Celebration Ale must be on the shelves. It's like biting into a raw hop leaf. Would I be too out of line to describe Celebration as a world-class IPA to go with SN's world-class pale ale?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,Brent,4.4,"Huge and hoppy. This year's edition seemed even hoppier than '99 or '00. Although a little more IBUs, it didn't seem quite as spicy as in the past. Nonetheless, a great winter brew. Break out the crackling fire.  Notes from 2000: Even 6 months later, I remember this as fruity and hoppy. How long to Christmas?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,John,4.76,Every year when Nov. rolls around one of the things that makes the onset of fall/winter bareable is SN Celebration. This year's is the smoothest and most balanced yet. Consistently one of my top ten beers.  Notes from 2000: This lovely brew is got to be top ten material. Won't be long now for this year's supply!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,pbrian,5,"This is why I drink beer. All year long is merely a warm-up for the day when SN Celebration hits the shelf. Hops, Hops, Hops, accompanied by just the right amount of malt. Onslaught of flavor. Awesome.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,1904,mattmaples,4.4,This is a good winter / Stong ale. Real big fresh hop flavor to it. Enough malt to back it up. Nice hop/spice aroma.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
