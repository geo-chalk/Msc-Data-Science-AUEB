345,14916,brewme,4.5,"Reminded of this beer by the How many Beers of Fame have you reviewed? post. Surprised that I have not reviewed this before, have probably had a case of this. Miss this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,1009,3.96,"A smooth drinking IPA that pours into a gorgeous golden haze with about a 2 inch white frothy head. The head lingers for a while in the glass which is great. The beer gives off wonderful hoppy.earthy aromas with a tropical twist. The taste follows the nose giving pine and floral like notes, but with some tropical fruit notes too. This definitely packs a wallop at 7.5%, but does drinks more like a session. Could definitely have more than one, but I would not advise, as the alcohol could sneak up on you. Enjoy the drinkability and smoothness of this wonderfully crafted IPA!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,GaBeerGarden,4.85,"I’ve been saving this bottle for a few years only to pull it out after a Hop Devil. It is still one of my favorites. Great flavor, color, nose, and flavor. Victory excels again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,PathofChaos,3.47,"Appearance: Liquid gold. Pure, clean, and translucent. Looks like an ale you'd expect to see in the tavern of a great dwarven kingdom, just don't drink too deeply, or too greedily. Puffs up a layer of choppy white foam that disappears after introductions are over, living on only as a pattern of sticky, striated lacing.  Bouquet: Floral, earthy notes but their aroma is dainty and distant, like flowers far away on a mountain. Traces of dried pine occasionally waft in on that far-off mountain breeze. Pleasant, but falls profoundly short of being impressive.  Feel: A cold, babbling brook of bubbles cascade gently on this light-bodied ale. Crisp with a dry, tangy finish that promises to linger but ends up dipping out early.  Taste: Bright, semi-sweet pine, quiet notes of pepper, and a wisp of lemongrass all stand before a crackery malt backbone.  Overall: Meh? It’s pleasing, refreshing, and there's nothing wrong with it but it’s meek and doesn't add anything new to the genre. A serviceable, middle-of-the-road IPA that'll never stand out but sometimes that's just what the menu calls for.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Peach63,4.28,"Pours golden yellow with a 2 inch white head with good retention. Heavy lacing to end.  Strong aroma of pine, grapefruit, earthy, floral.  Taste is resiny, pine, slight spiciness, including pepper.  Medium bodied, light carbonation. Dry, bitter finish.  This is a damn good IPA! One of the best.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Lone_Freighter,3.83,"Had this several times before my dad gave me a 6-er about two weeks ago. I have one of these left but here are my thoughts now. Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a semi-dark yellow branded color with some transparency about it. Some carbonation seem rising at a modest pace. Lace coats in a semi-dusty way but clingy. The aroma had a strong citrusy pithy/bitter rind character strolling in for a balance with some bitter piney hop tones. Malts seem barely there. The flavor leaned towards the bitter side with a touch of sweet pine dry needles arranging underneath. Mild pine tree aftertaste, fairly dry. The mouthfeel was pretty dry running along my tongue. Holding it's own as its scraping like what I remember of old school IPA's/DIPA's. Sturdy carbonation and good for the style. Sure is a sipper. Finishes bitter through dry pine tree notes.dry Overall, not for the faint of heart, this is what old school DIPA's seem to have started out as. This is one I would come back to preferably for me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Fordcoyote15,3.05,Pretty awful. I love a bitter west coast IPA but this is like licking dirt. Theres no redeeming malty balance Its pithy and downright awful imo.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,DavetotheB,3.7,"From a 12oz bottle dated enjoy by 5/6/20. Pours a golden translucent yellow with about two fingers of white fluffy head. Moderate retention, decent lacing. Smells of fresh cut grass. Not picking up much else. Taste is similar to the nose. Grassy and bitter. Mouthfeel is dry with a bitter aftertaste. This a palate wrecker. Overall, not picking up the fruitiness described on the label, but it's not awful. Pretty much a hop bomb. Price point is favorable as well, less than $11 for a 6er.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Danzifer,3.17,"It pours clean, retains a slight head with fine lacing, looks decent, gold with very few particles, it smells nice and naturey but I couldn't taste anything! Nothing except a very slight sour pinch from tropic fruits and tiny bit of bitter. Interesting... For a beer that has ""Hop"" in the name I figured it'd be like most IPA's but this one is extremely unusual. I guess it's ok, goes down easy and has high ABV. Hell, I'd try it again just to see if it really doesn't have any taste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,cjeep,3.67,big fan of the brewery but this one is not fully working for me. i haven't had this one in a few years and i think they made some changes that i don't find L: looks fine S; some citrus and grass T: this is where it goes awry for me. strong lemony taste that is just distracting. all i get beyond it is the bitterness. just not a pleasant combination. F: smooth with medium carbonation O: sorry - i wanted to like it much more but i'm not feeling it.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jkblr,4.06,"12oz bottle enjoy by 06 May 2020 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7.5% ABV. The beer pours bright light amber with abundant off white head. The head slowly settles to thick cap leaving the glass covered in lacing. The aroma dank and earthy predominantly with notes of citrus and pine underneath. The taste is more of the same with citrus and pine given the heavy hitting Simcoe punch over a pleasant light malt body. Heavily bitter throughout (no surprise). The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, very good, but not in my taste preference. I'm not a big Simcoe fan and it dominates this beer IMO. Still very well made and a nice reminder of this beer blowing my mind years ago.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,deleted_user_995920,3.93,"Pours a semi translucent light honey color with a foamy white head , which dissipates quickly. Smell is reminiscent of citrus,mild toffee, (never used that description for an IPA), hay and earth. Taste is some fruitiness and some dank earth flavor.Mildly astringent. Surprised at the large malt bill, hops get washed away too quickly by a malt rush. (Uneven?) Feels well carbonated, medium body,finishes juicy. Overall if it did not have such an edge the malt bill could be reduced in my opinion. Seems the added malt was necessary because of the beer's astringency. Definitely get walloped by the hops. Good beer",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,gcasher,4.39,"12 oz bottle fresh Poured about 20oz in a nice tall ale glass Beautiful classic appearance of clear and golden ale with a big foamy white head that sticks around. The aroma is not overpowering, but very pleasant of citrus and tropical fruit and some biscuit the flavor starts with the biscuit malt and is quickly surpassed by bitter grapefruit from the hops. There is some caramel from the malt and some sweet mango at the end. This is a superb IPA and the price point is fantastic at $10/six.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Alieniloquium,3.88,"12 oz. bottle. A beer I used to drink a long time ago and never reviewed. Pours clear golden. Smells of light orange, biscuit malt, and some grapefruit. Hints of garlic and onion hops. Tastes of grapefruit hops, light malt sweetness, biscuit and cracker malt, and a chewy grapefruit back end. A bit heavier than medium bodied. Drinks just a little slower than most IPAs. A tasty beer and no wonder I used to enjoy this way back in the day.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,nicholas2121,4,"Hop Wallop brewed by Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown, with an ABV of 7.50% The brew pours out of a 12oz glass bottle into a pint beer glass. This American IPA pours out a nice deep golden amber color with a nice thick white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell of Hop Wallop is rich with hop bitterness, mixed with lots of earthy tones. The is a nice amount of earthy grains and malts in the smell mixed with a slight sweetness. So far Hop Wallop has the look an smell of most IPA'S on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. This is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with hop bitterness at first, then it sticks around. You also pick up on nice smooth earthy grains and malts to tie it all together. The body is a medium to heavy, but not to heavy. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.50% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. Hop Wallop IPA would go nice with dinner. The mouth feel is Bold, Hoppy, Rich, Clean Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Hop Wallop a soild 4 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity too. Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown, did a real nice job with this American IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,hman43,4.12,"Look: It pours golden and clear with a white head. Head retention is very good.  Smell: It has aromas of citrus and pine which are quite high. There is also a back ground grainy sweet element.  Taste: There flavors are centered around the citrus with some pine in support. There is a low level of floral and slight spiciness with a little git of grainy sweetness.  Feel: It has a medium body with medium carbonation.  Overall, the hops is this beer are quite intense and work well together.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,jrc1093,4.03,"Best by 5/11/19  Pours a crystal clear dirty gold with a small but persistent off-white head; decent retention yields plenty of speckled lacing holding to the glass alongside a faint collar with solid longevity.  Aromas of deep, almost sweaty notes of dank hops, grapefruit rind, and dense pine balanced only by a stiff, crackery malt backbone.  Taste brings further grapefruit-influenced pine and heavy, sweaty hop tones; finish is balanced by the crackery malt backbone, but remains overarchingly hoppy with an abundance of herbal and dank floral tones.  Mouthfeel is crisp, dry, snappy, and with no shortage of weight to it on the swallow; not bitter, not overly malty, just excellent balance on the palate while maintaining a consistent strength. Light-medium body on the palate is bolstered by medium, excellently balanced carbonation.  The hops here are so aggressive and yet well-tempered, this is at incredible level as far as sessionable, old-school IPAs go; where the hops are aggressive, all other elements are refined for drinkability, resulting in the type of beer I’d take pleasure in drinking frequently.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,Ronl12,3.75,12 oz bottle into IPA glass. No date. Look fairly clear golden orange. Smell is light citrus orange. Taste follows and ends with little dank grapefruit. Feel is fairly light.

345,14916,captaincoffee,3.75,"I'd call this a throwback IPA, as it really reminds me of what I was looking for back in the 90s. Bitter, somewhat hoppy nose, old school flavors. The nose is probably the least interesting part of the beer. Pine and a little citrus along with some earthy and herbal notes. A bit of a mish-mash. Taste has a big malt backbone, which I think is fine (I'm not so sure why so many people hate any malt in their IPAs). But the hops are really bring bitterness as opposed to flavor here. Again, more of an old school pine thing going on. Overall, decent but not interesting or exciting. I didn't rate Dirt Wolf as high as most either, so maybe this brewer's IPAs just aren't for me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,scream,4.04,"Was quite looking forward to this when I heard it was being released. Look-medium copper color Smell-a light resinous smell to it Taste-has a good hop bite to it, little malt detected Feel-aside from the hop bite a bit on the lighter side.

S---Well, it's hoppy, as advertised. Pine & citrus are dominant.  T---Hop dominant. Pine & citrus are up front as in the nose. There's both a sweetness and an astringent bitterness. Nicely balanced.  F---Medium-full mouthfeel. Not particularly well carbonated. Alcohol is present, but it's not boozy.  O---A good IIPA, but not a classic or anything.

345,14916,Caveworm,4.06,"Hop Wallop | Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this brew's sporting a two finger thick off-white head, webbed lacing, and a clear medium-light amber body.  I smell plenty of pine, citrus, and tropical aromas from the hops and a big, sweet honey biscuit malt backbone.  Tastes like a nice heap of the hops mentioned above that. The malt sweetness is somewhat muted by the expected bitterness.  Medium mouthfeel with mild carbonation. Definitely has a lingering hop aftertaste that usually comes with the style of beer.  Hop Wallop | Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown gets a 4 out of me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,tjwarren,2.74,"I am a huge fan of Victory. That being said... what they did to Hop Wallop is a crime. I was ecstatic when I learned of its re-release. I gasped when I found it. But, let’s get serious Victory, this is not Hop Wallop. This a a sweet beer that tastes almost like a rye beer. It should be called Malt Wallop. It is not a horrible beer in and of itself it is just not what is says it is. I have trouble even calling it an IPA. It is a beer, I am just not sure what kind of a beer it is. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I miss the soul crushing, pallet wrecking bitterness of the old Hop Wallop. I feel the people who bought this based on legacy are owed an explanation. Or a refund.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Wexfordbeer,3.94,This is quite hoppy. I like hop but this might be just a bit too hoppy for me. It is a good beer but it's tough for me to taste anything but the hop.

345,14916,thebeers,4.03,"Clear gold with good effervescence and three fingers of creamy off-white head that last a good while and leave heavy lacing.  Skunky pine, forest floor, flowers, apple juice, pineapple and biscuity malt in the nose.  A little residual fruit juice and white wine sweetness in the taste, with strong floral and pine hops in the finish — but not exactly the wallop I remember from twelve years ago. The aftertaste is a really nice mix of pine hop bitterness and that light sweetness.  Sticky, syrupy, medium-bodied feel with moderate carbonation. The beer really coats and sticks to the mouth, letting the flavors linger.  Not quite the palate wrecker I remember, but still a real treat. Would love this as a seasonal release for the Eagles postseason.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,mickey72,4.59,"The closest East Coast beer to Pliny the Elder. One of the greatest Double IPAs to come out of the Northeast. Smooth, refreshing, and the perfect balance of hops.

345,14916,DeaconWhite82,4.36,"Was one of my go to cases of beer. This was before Giant Eagle sold 6 packs. Just a quality IPA. The taste is the same as I like my women, bitter. I was disappointed when they discontinued this beer. The price was right.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,rodbeermunch,3.26,"Both darker and with more haze than average. Mild 1/3"" head. Aroma was not as hoppy as I expected, some residual sweet notes.  Can't figure out why this seems so sweet. Has the bitterness, but not a lot of hop flavor. Interesting hop choice on this one. Never struck me as a hop wallop, struck me more like someone wanted to make a Hopslam, amp up the honey at the expense of the hops, and instead of using tried and true proprietary, went with more noble like hops and experimental stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,cjgiant,4.07,"On tap: Pours clear as day, a splash of orange in a golden lake. A bit of froth around the lake, nothing outrageous but present. Agitate the lakes and the froth bubbles; leave it alone it will stick to the shore.  The nose speaks more to the growth around the lake, vegetal, slightly flowery, maybe a hint of fruit are all growing nearby. I get an oniony note in some sniffs that has me wondering. Definitely more herbal as my nose approaches the shoreline.  Clean opening with a honey and lightly metallic opening which to me indicates something ""noble"" in the depths of this beer. Almost too clean, I though initially. But the evidence of the shore vegetation seeps into the taste, more herbal and grassy than vegetal.  The rolling of the beer is nice, enough rocking to make it an interesting ride, but not enough to toss the boat. The break between the choppy opening and the bitter end is nice. A little drying from resin and alcohol keeps the beer in below its flood stage.  Ok-that was fine trying to keep up the metaphor. But this was a beer that I started out thinking - eh, it's decent but nothing special. I can view this as a more classic east coast DIPA, and a good version of it. Subtle in its nature, especially compared to newer hop bombs, but enough clean malt and sneaky bitterness here to be quite enjoyable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Look: On tap at the Pour House in North Wales. Appearance is that of a Pilsner, slightly deep golden straw with a nice foam and solid lacing.  Aroma: Extremely clean aroma full of grass, pine, and some citrus. It's almost of if you're walking through an evergreen forest in the early morning, really great stuff.  Taste: While the aroma isn't overly hoppy, the taste is where you definitely get ""hop walloped"". Citrus, piney resin, and dank bitterness are all out in full force.

One was pleasant, two began to wear thin. So a case lasted months in my fridge. Recognize that it was a fine beer, but it just had too much attitude. I understand that it was retired in favor of Dirt Wolf. I have to say, I've recently taken a chance and grabbed a case of Dirt Wolf. It has all the best qualities of Hop Wallop without the excess.

Pine and citrus predominate and it's a bit zesty. Love the clean bitter finish. A little zesty, and definitely a sipper.  O: A very strong Imperial IPA from Victory and a shame it was discontinued.

Pretty clear, maybe a little chill haze. Two fingers of head that slowly dissipates. Awesome lacing on the glass. S: For an old bottle the hops are still very present in the aroma. Powerful citrus and pine. There's almost a hoppy sweetness in the nose. T: Yep, awesome beer. It lives up to the hype for me. Strong hop characteristics of pine, citrus, and floral notes. Slightly resinous. There's actually a very slight sourness to it like a strong belgian pale. Perhaps that's from the age. MF: There's a great malt character that keeps this beer pretty balanced for all the hoppyness it provides. Very carbonated, again almost like a belgian strong ale. The alcohol is very present, slightly warming. O: An awesome beer. I wish there were more than one of these at the bottle shop. Great balance of malt sweetness and hop bitterness.

T: Slight hop flavor to this, but I know this beer is past its prime (even though they give it a year due to the bottle conditioning). Decent enough for the age, and quite piney. Even a bit of a spice on the end. Easy drinking and not super bitter.  M: Good level of carbonation, that is subtle and soft. Not crisp or harsh at all.

Appearance is an enticing bright rusty orange and poured a very thin head from a 12oz bottle.  Smell is bright and hoppy, with a little booze, probably from the age.  The taste is a mighty fine hop bomb with very prevalent citrus notes. The citrus flavors seem a bit dull for a brew this hoppy, again I believe due to the age of this beer those flavors have probably faded over time.  Mouthfeel is a delight, slightly too boozy, but again probably only to do with the age.

Hop Wallop poured a hazy and cloudy gold yellow hue with a two finger white soapy head. The lacing sat in rings as I took each sip.  The smell was almost none existent for me. Resinious hops and bready malts were the only faint things I picked up.  The taste was the best part of this beer. It was dominated by the dank piney hops and a layer of toasted malts on the tongue. At the back end, I tasted orange (it was subtle) but the bitterness kept coming.  I think this beer needed a stronger malt backbone to intensify the hops. Overall not my favorite from Victory. DirtWolf is a big improvement.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

T: Taste is much more floral, unfortunately, but still has some citric, though not acidic, notes. Pine and other floral notes are much more harsh.  M: Carbonation is like a typical IPA, not so much like a double IPA, but really, at 8%, it's more of a strong IPA than a DIPA. Medium bodied.

345,14916,Bosoxfan20,2.98,"A- Pours a hazy golden color with a dense white head of about 2 fingers. As the haze settles, it gives way to a clean gold.  S- Straw, some pine, and light floral notes. Not as assertive with the citrus American hops as most of the style. Almost as though it has a pilsner malt.  T- The proclaimed west coast hops begin to have an impact on the taste. Hop forward with sharp, toasted malt (only a slight touch of caramel) begins to even things out. The finish is somewhat disappointing as the lingering bitterness is spicy, yet lackluster in continuity. An unwelcoming bitter char lays on the tongue.  M- Drinkable with a crisp, snappy bite. Alcohol is fairly present, but not hot by any means.  O- Fair. Not in love with the idea that I ordered a 6 pack of this one. But glad I was able to give it a shot before it is impossible to find with production coming to an end. Just doesn't do it for me as the flavor profile attempts to be complex but seems more all over the map to me.

345,14916,Jadjunk,3.92,"""Horace 'Hop' Wallop headed West a broken man. For in the City of Blues a Miss LuLu Belle Lager had left him thirsting for more. Drawn by wild tales of riches to be had in the gold mines, Hop pressed on westward. His last nickel spent on a prospecting pan, Hop's hunger got the best of him. Two fistfuls of barley and three of some wild and wayward hops tossed in a pan with some clear water was to be his meal. But sleep overcame him and he later awoke to a bubbling, cacophonous concoction. Overjoyed with the beautiful ale he had made, Hop realized the secret of the green gold he had discovered in those fresh hops. Celebrated far and wide, Hop Wallop lives on in this vivid ale with his words, 'hoppiness is happiness.' Enjoy!"" Brewed in the style of an Imperial India Ale. Previously a year round 6 pack, Hop Wallop was recently discontinued in lieu of Victory's new 4 pack offering, the Dirtwolf DIPA. Always available as a common find in the local area, this can still be found in a few spots around town, even months after retirement. This is my send off review.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a tulip glass. Served north of 55º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a medium-thick creamy froth head of a golden cream color over a very hazy unfiltered deep amber body. Plenty of sediment lies in suspension and carbonation is modest. Retention is good and lacing is light and spotty. 4  (Smell) Biscuity pale and caramel malts with a soft peppery, grainy edge. The hop profile has faded, but what remains is a blend of floral, lemony and tropical fruit notes with a medium bitterness. A mellow yeast profile provides subtle esters and fruity notes that round out the aroma. Potency is medium. 3.5  (Taste) Based on the aroma, one would expect this drink to be much lighter drinking. Spicy biscuity malts and peppery grains are amplified tremendously in the flavor, up front-and center and provide a robust body without an overbearing sweetness. Hop flavors are subdued in depth and complexity, but do generate a significant bitterness to counter the flavors. Very tasty and aggressively-flavored Imperial India Pale Ale. 4  (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, grainy, mildly chewy with a light syrup drizzle. Carbonation adds some crispness and spritely textures for a charismatic texture collectively. Body is medium/heavy for the style and medium/heavy overall. Alcohol presence is medium. The balance is in favor of bitterness, and the earthy grain notes build it up further. Finishes very mildly dry with a dash of citrus juice. 3.75  (Overall) I love the assertive malt profile in this beer as it really makes this Double IPA a memorable one for me. While it is edgy in places it's not too harsh to enjoy nor is it too light to sip delicately. Bitterness is enthusiastically bold in this beer and the flavors make it very enjoyable and filling. I miss it already. I can only assume that this should return in the near future, even if it were a seasonal, this is a very enjoyable India Pale Ale. 4  Victory Brewing Company's Hop Wallop Very Hoppy Ale 3.93/5.00",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Scrapss,4.12,"Hop Wallop. The brew with the funny old miner on the label. The funny ol' miner is on to something. Too bad he has been downsized.  A: deep yellow, clear. Absolutely no haze whatsoever. Big carbonation. Three finger head that only reduces to a 1 finger head that lasts and lasts. moderately active.  S: Big pine and lemongrass shine. at 3 months until death-by-date, the hop bill has mellowed. Big caramel and other assertive two row malts punch through. Months have put some balance into this huge-when-fresh-hop-blaster. Has some musty grapefruit funk still. Age has made this better IMO.  T: now that it has some months on it, it is fantastic instead of a hoppy, resiny mess. Grapefruit is a bitter citrus and muted nicely. spicy malts start saying ""hey, I was here all along....but those darn hops were so strong I didn't have this chance 3 months ago!""  M: Smooth and creamy due to apparent carbonation. this is smooth on uptake. creamy mid palate. then it has a balanced punch of bitter citrus and sharp, caramel malts at ultimate finish and boozy at outbreath. This brings the heat but it was expected for this DIPA.  O: Insanely good at what I understand to be 9 months old. It must have been well taken care of. Would recommend at this stage. Earlier Hop Wallop was way hop forward and out of balance. Any later would be too malty for a DIPA. This is the Goldilocks of beer now. And it will never be at this state again.

345,14916,falloutsnow,3.76,"From: Binny's, Schaumburg, IL Date: Best by 2013-03-24 Glass: Tulip  Victory's Hop Wallop is definitely hop forward, but in a non-tropical fruit way, making this DIPA differ from many other recipes currently in production. The hops supposedly change each year, and this year there seems to be a C-hop meets Germanic hop pairing, which generally works fairly well. The brewers could reign in the ethanol obviousness a bit, and the hops tend to have a slightly harsh quality to them in the close, but this is still a surprisingy drinkable ale that I was expecting much less from. If this were not going out of production, I could see myself picking up an annual six-pack of this.  Pours a voluminous head of apparently as many centimeters as you'd like, this one being around 3cm. Foam is made up of small-sized bubbles, fairly dense and frothy. Retention is excellent, the foam lasting over two minutes in a decline to a thin cap atop the body of the beer that lasts for the duration of the drink. Lacing is also excllent, with thick, wide rings of foam clinging to all sides of the glass. Bod is a dark golden orange color, with light bringing out much brighter golden orange hues. Carbonation is readily visible through the hazy (50% opacity) body, quite numerous and active.  Aroma is of musty grapefruit and pine, with light dried grass and perfume-like floral characters. Somewhat like a blend of Cascade with some German varieties added in as well.  Front of palate finds modest pale malt sweetness with dried grass and grape-like flavors, also hints of musty grapefruit. Mid-palate picks up strong musty grapefruit, dried grass, perfume-like floral characters, mild pine, modest ethanol, and strong hop bitterness. Back of palate experiences dried grass, herbal, and slightly harsh hop flavors with hints of musty grapefruit and strong bitterness. Aftertaste of slightly harsh herbal hops with continued strong hop bitterness and lesser dried grass and musty grapefruit flavors.  Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a beer that is soft and foamy on the palate (3/4) with some smoothness as well (1/4); definitely a good feel. Ethanol is felt in the nostrils and back of throat, but not terribly so for a 8.5% beer. Closes very dry, with heavy stickiness on the lips and palate.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Very nice aromas with good complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and good strength.

Fair amount of earthy floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, and bread on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly slick, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice DIPA. All around good balance and complexity of hop and light malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on.

345,14916,scotorum,4.3,"ORIGINAL REVIEW, 6/28/13: Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  a: 4.0 Yummy deep clear gold. Finger thick head dissipated to a light even surface foam, a thin ring and heavy lacing which hung on for most of the consummation. s: 3.75 Vaguely citrus. t: 4.25 Intense orange-pine hops.. More on the pine side as it warmed, and more deliciously so. m: 4.0 Medium due to the hop bite. Savory to sip. o: 4.0 Lived up to its name! A wonderful summer sipper which held its own beside the cigar I smoked while drinking it. Delightful.  UPDATE 10/30/13: Found some leftover bottles to try again. Especially wanted to do a side by side with the new DirtWolf which is replacing it. Will have a DirtWolf in a bit and do a comparison review under DirtWolf.  NEW REVIEW: Poured into a Sierra Nevada IPA glass from the 12 oz. bottle. No dates on the bottle or label, but I presume this has a few months on it by now.  a: Clear gold. Brisk pour produced a huge three inch dense white head which almost spilled over the top of the glass but held a wondrous curve a quarter of an inch above the rim. Eventually receded to lumpy surface foam and excellent patterned lacing. A bottle conditioned gem!  s: Moderate citrus and pine,.  t; Pine and citrus flavor without much of the promised hop wallop forward. Its age could be showing. More like a good strong single than a double. Later, the hop presence built. Dryish finish with some hop bite at the sides of the tongue. High ABV was not very evident.  m: Smooth medium. Adding the dregs after the halfway mark boosted the body even more.  o: Reconfirmed my earlier review of this as a great summer sipper. Tasty and refreshing, but now definitely coming up a bit short in the hop wallop dept., at least early on. Still a tasty, very drinkable high ABV DIPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

That said I would love to have had this fresh because it still has tons of hop character. The aroma is more to the fruit with tangerines, grapefruit and orange. The malt was obviously stronger as it gets older but I'm impressed with what I had.  The flavor also retained great hop properties with a strong tangerine flavoring, tinge of grapefruit, earthy floral, and piney resin. The malt is subdued. There is some onions flavor or chive but it's not too bad. I catch a bit of spiciness, maybe an earthy kick of pepper.  The feel is a touch thin and astringent but overall I'm so impressed with this and am sorry I missed this when it was running.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,Zackcavalier,3.25,"East coast imperial IPA...sign me up. My initial excitement was short lived as this beer did not fit together well for me.  A- certainly the best characteristic for me. Poured into a pint glass, the head was about 1.5 fingers, off white/white. Lingered on to of the beer, but not completely covering it.  S- the hops are there, right up front. Might smell a bit wet-doggish and earthy. Subtle citrus, but fairly unremarkable to my nose.  T- some malt gets on my tongue early but is very quickly overwhelmed by hop bitterness. Finish is bitter, but not hop-bitter...almost metallic bitter. Some of the earthiness that was present in he smell is also present here.  M- harsh. When I taste for feel, I will often hold my mouth closed without breathing and let the beer rest on my tongue. I was unable to do so with this beer. The metallic bitterness was so pronounced that it literally overwhelmed THE FEEL. A little bit of carbonation can be felt, and you definitely now you have a mouthful of beer.  O- I found this beer to be out of balance. The hop notes, while expected, were not supported by the other attributes of the beer. This reminds me of some over the top west coast style all hop ipas I had when I was in California. Maybe I had a bad beer, but the enjoy by date was April 2014, and I was drinking it in September of 13.

Smells absolutely fantastic with large amounts of earthy pineapple and grapefruit with those great grass notes. Almost slightly herbal but the pine/forest/tropical fruit notes keep it smelling fresh. From the smell I expect a nice malty/hop balance and some high bitterness to boot.  Taste is initially very nicely balanced with the large cracker like malt backbone and some huge pine/spice/rye/grass and tropical hop flavors. Then the bitter bite kicks in towards the middle of the taste. Leaves you smacking your lips and wanting more. Ends with a strong hop/rye/bitter afernote. Very pleasant taste the entire way through.  Mouthfeel is nicely viscous yet moderately carbonated so it doesn't feel too thick. Has some great body and feels full and round. Nice amount of drinkability considering the high abv.

Tart grapefruit and fresh sliced orange. Sticky with sweetness and pine resin. Finishes dry with a spruce aftertaste and the hop cone itself at the back of the throat.

T - The malt and hops are noticeable in large amounts. A fair amount of grapefruit is present, too. The only drawback is a slightly unpleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. Hop bitterness doesn't bother me at all, but this tasted slightly off. Sort of like a dirt bitterness. Still though, a very good tasting beer.  F - About average for an IPA. Slightly thick and very slightly stickly. Not real dry though, which was nice.  O - A pretty good DIPA. A ton of very good flavor, and they mix well. Only reason the beer isn't rated a bit higher is because of the bitterness. Again, it's a strange bitterness that tastes a bit like dirt, rather than hops. This is the only drawback of the beer.

The caramel malts are a little bit heavier than hops and give the beer a sweeter than usual flavor (could also be that the hops have gone down a bit.).  Mouthfeel: Heavy bodied and a little bit sticky but not too bad. Leaves the mouth wet and not very dry.  Overall: Not the best DIPA but definitely a good one worth buying again.

345,14916,Greywulfken,4.28,"A: in the pint, deep gold body, slight haze, ivory tower head, persistent cap, lace striations  S: semi-sweet malts strain to escape the citrus, pine, and flroal aromas from this beer  T: malts suggest butterscotch caramel beneath the hop barrage of citric, bitter, and crisp impressions  M: smooth, but under a bittering hop-load, medium-full body, slightly slick and slightly coating  O: fairly lush and creamy but powerfully hopped and bitter - the malts do their job supporting the heaving hop ""wallop"" this beer brings. No doubt something any D/IPA fan should try. Not as hyped as some other brewers' D/IPAs, but certainly a strong example of the style.  Revisted on 1/17/19 with new hop formulation of Citra and Simcoe - no idea what it used to be - bottle had a best buy date of May 19, 2019 - beer is still crisp, with piney aromatics, but with subtle, soft, sweeter fruit notes beneath... Still really nice - leaving original review and scores intact...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,nmatros,4.55,"Poured into a pint glass.  Excellent froth head retention.  Smell- some citrus and some funk from the hop  Taste- I picked up some very strong initial caramel from the malt and just when I'm ready to say it's too much like candy the bitterness of the hops comes in and bites it off. I don't get walloped by the hop, but the fresh hop does come through, adding a bit of a floral grassy finish to the candy bar start.  Overall- I just returned to this one after finding it available at the distributor for 3 bucks less than the Fairway price. While it doesn't really sound like its name (there are much more face-puckering hop punches available to smack you around out there), this achieves its wallop more subtly, and therefore provides a complexity that makes me want to keep coming back.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,barczar,3.99,"Pours a clear deep golden color, with a frothy one inch ivory head that slowly dissipates, leaving spotty sheets of lacing.  Grapefruit, dank cannabis, resin, and pine form the initial aroma. There's a toasted caramel malt backbone. Earthy, minerally notes emerge as it warms, along with a hint of floral hops.  Flavor is fairly bitter and very resiny. Minerally, earthy tones dominate, with underpinnings of grapefruit and pine adding complexity. The slightly sweet, toasted malt backbone weaves throughout, providing respite from the bitter hop barrage.  Body is moderate and smooth, with carbonation a touch on the high side, and moderate alcohol warmth.  Very earthy, resiny, and bitter. Definitely not for the faint of hop. Unfortunately, it's not my cup of tea, but it's fairly interesting. Wish the citrus flavor were more pronounced.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

I can smell it already as I pour it; getting some wafts of alcohol and something like wine almost. In the glass it smells a lot more yeasty than I was expecting, with piney hops in the background. Taste is the same, I'd almost think it had Belgian yeast involved somewhere. I think that confusing flavor may be coming from the combination of incredibly bitter hops and less malt presence. Smooth and yeasty?, with hops coming in and finishing very bitter. I appreciate how complex this DIPA is. It's a nice turn from the usual (malt)HOPSHOPSHOPS.

345,14916,dar482,3.88,"This beer comes in a wonderful deep gold, orange color that is very hazy as you cannot see through it.  The aroma is of huge tropical fruits. Pineapple, orange, mango with a bit of a bready note. It’s very juicy. There is just a fantastic aroma on this.  The flavor does not match the aroma. It starts off with some grapefruit and then goes with some piney flavor. It just punches you with a huge hop astringent bitterness that really sticks on the front of your tongue. One of the bitterest beers I have had. The middle has a bit of maltiness to it that carries the beer along before the smack of bitterness.  The mouthfeel is medium.  In the end, I wish it had more grapefruit fruitiness to match the fruits on the nose. The bitterness overpowers the beer. It's also the hop profile that isn't really for my suiting. I prefer a dry finish that has that fresh grapefruit peel flavor. It's more of a piney, resiny, earthy, flora finish on the end. This just is slightly off in a confusing sense that isn't quite right. If it was toned down a bit, I would like it a lot more with its beautiful hazy color and maltiness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Jugs_McGhee,3.35,"1 pint 6 fl oz brown glass bottle with fun label art and blue branded standard pressure cap acquired at the Cap N Cork liquor in Los Feliz for a scant $3.99 USD and served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Acquired earlier tonight. Expectations are through the roof given its current ratings; Victory is growing on me as well. No visible bottled on or best before date.  Served cold, straight from the fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Appears extremely overcarbonated, pouring an eight finger head. White in colour. Good thickness, nice froth and cream. Excellent (~8+ minute) retention for the high ABV. Body colour is a clear translucent yellow; looks more like a pilsner than an IPA. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Pretty appealing for the style, but far from ideal. I'm excited to try it.  Sm: Pale malts. Grassy malts. Some graininess. Floral hop character is shockingly restrained. It smells like a hoppy pilsner, to be honest. No bold hop character here. No yeast character nor any alcohol is detectable. Clean, crisp, fresh, and appealing. Not the aroma I'm used to for the style, but I'm intrigued. Mild in strength. Some straw. Lemon zest. Lemon grass. Surprisingly lemony for an IPA.  T: Prominent floral hop character suits the simple clean pale malt foundation nicely. Lemon grass and lemon zest surface. Pleasant and approachable, if simple. Some straw notes. Crystal malt. Grassy malts. The hop character isn't particularly deep or diverse, but the balance is lovely. It flirts with hop bitterness but none ever really surfaces. A tasty IPA, if a strangely built one. I do like it, but it's not what I expected.  Mf: Smooth and wet. Overcarbonated. Good thickness. Nice body. Suits the flavour profile pretty well. Pretty good presence on the palate. No overt flaws. Quite light on the palate considering the style and ABV.  Dr: A rather drinkable IPA from Victory that hides its ABV impressively well. I'd have it again. Well worth trying, and priced extremely well for its quality. Victory is rising fast in my estimation of quality. Quite tasty stuff. Not a conformist IPA; it does its own thing and I respect that. I'd recommend it to friends. Well worth revisiting.  B-",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Pours a clear amber with a persistent off-white head. Initial impression is a fairly standard IPA - bitter hops, some citrus, a little (but not much) caramel, moderate lingering bitterness, Mouthfeel is medium, as is carbonation. West-coastish.

345,14916,Naters333,3.68,"Poured into my tulip from 12 oz bottle with best by June 2, 2013 on the bottle.  A-Pours a very clear deep golden color. Almost a rich honey color. Very clear. Hardly any carbonation. Very nice 2 inch off white head, that leaves great lacing as I drink.  S- Not very strong with the hops. The smell is not a wallop as far as hops go. Slight hops, sweet, citrus, lemon. Alcohol.  T- Bitter, biscuit, lemon, major biscuit malt on the aftertaste. Crisp. Oranges. Almost nectarines.  M- Very nice. About medium body for the style. Strong. The 8.5 really comes through. I know some people say its smooth, which I agree with, but I can really taste the alcohol.  O- I really enjoyed the 5 others in the six pack. I waited to review this beer on the final one, and I was a bit let down. Overall, a decent representation of the style, but I prefer Victory's ranch DIPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Chickenhawk9932,4.29,"Pours a pale gold with a thick off white head. Very good retention with some real nice lacing.  In the nose is big citrus - lemon, orange, grapefruit and apricot - backed by some nice delicate floral notes.  A biscuity malt hits the back of the mouth as bitter citrus explodes across the mouth tart lemon and grapefruit test the palates limits and end with slight sweet apricot and orange linger that fades into a dry scotch like finish. An excellent DIPA with subtle delicate complexity.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,gr0g,3.66,"Clear and light amber in color, looking very much like the Headwaters Pale Ale I just had prior to this. Some fine particulate matter (""floaties""). A three-finger head with good retention is quite impressive, but it leaves only a smattering of lace behind. Nose is very straightforward with floral and citrus notes from the hops. Pleasant lemon/orange aromas are unfortunately too subdued. According to earlier taste notes, this isn't the first time I've encountered a weak aroma with this beer. It could be that I've never gotten it fresh, but the aroma is quite tame.  Taste features plenty of hop bitterness, as expected, with tropical fruit (orange, mango) coming through. Not as super-bright and grassy as other DIPAs (90 Minute and Burton Baton from Dogfish come to mind). Malt backbone is quite assertive, more so than with any other DIPA I've tried. A big toffee malt profile is held in check, but just barely. Finishes dry with a touch of alcohol. Carbonation is moderately soft, perhaps a bit prickly. At 8.5% ABV this is certainly not a session beer, but the drinkability is quite good for the style.  While not outstanding, Hop Wallop is a well done DIPA that comes across as a higher gravity but otherwise straightforward IPA. The aroma, often an important characteristic of IPAs, is disappointing, though. Worth a try, at least.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,CopperMtnPlowboy,4.85,"Poured a dark golden color with 1/4"" head.  Smells like a real beer, clean, crisp and hoppy. Almost no sweetness detected - a good thing.  Taste is superb. I get the name as a play on words - but it's true. The hops wallop the taste buds. Not too bitter as some hoppy beers, but just right. I get a little pine, and some citrus. Barely a hint of the malt and it's hard to believe its 8.5% ABV.  This is a very smooth beer, goes down crisp and refreshing.  Hard to imagine a beer much better.

Good retention and leaves a good amount of lacing.  S: Aroma is very citrus, almost tart citrus at times. Along with some sweet bready malts. Lots of grapefruit, and some tangerine.  T: A fair amount of bitterness, piney and grapefruit. Not a lot else going on, mostly just a non specific bitterness. A touch herbaceous.  M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation on the heavier side, probably a touch high for my liking. Carbonation combined with the bitterness give it a biting quality. Drinkability is moderate.  O: Overall, not bad, but pretty average.

Noble hop aroma and big German pils/pale malt aroma. A little grapefruit and a little pine. Very nice  T: crisp and clean tasting with a huge bite of bitterness. Awesome malt flavor... That crisp malt that you find in German pilsners helps balance out the big hop character. The hop flavor is big citrus bitterness and a little spicy and piney. Some heat from the high abv comes through after a few sips  M: nice spicy bitterness hangs around. But it's crisp and clean in an awesome way  Overall this is a must try for ipa lovers.

A hazy orange colored brew that boasts a massively thick creamy head that leaves a lot of nice sticky lacing around the glass and plenty of clumps floating on top.  Not surprisingly, the nose is decidedly hoppy with plenty of pine, citrus and a faint malt sweetness.  Tastes deliciously thick with hops...resinous pine, big citrus flavors - grapefruit, orange and some biscuit malt that keeps things in check. Incredible.  Thick and chewy, slick and creamy.  I absolutely love this brew. One of my favorite styles and being a double IPA, it makes it that much bolder and more flavorful.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,--Dom--,4.24,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a hazy orange with a one finger off white head, nice lacing. Smells of sweet caramel and pine as well as citrus.  Taste is not as sweet as it smells. Piney hopiness up front builds to a warm climax of bitter grapefruit, STRONG bitter. The strong bitter grapefruit dominates the back end and stays after the finish. Hop wallop is a pretty accurate name for this one. I get other citrus notes in there as well but predominately grapefruit. Don't over chill this one, I'd recommend it a little on the warmer side than usual. Slight maltiness is present but the hop is so consistent throughout you really have to want to taste it to notice it. Like I said, I definitely like it more as it warms. It's strong to boot, I'm feeling the effects after only drinking a 3rd of so of it.  Mouthfeel is pretty heavy carbonation up front, slightly sticky finish. Overall I really like it. I can't see myself having this more than a few times a year but it is definitely worth grabbing a six pack of. A word of caution: I do not see this being something a novice palate would appreciate, definitely not the beer to introduce someone to DIPA's with. That being said, hop fans, you wouldn't want to miss this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,rangerred,4.52,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a hazy dark orange with a pretty solid one finger white head. Really great head retention and decent lacing.  Aroma is very herbal with a bit of citrus thrown in. There is a very lemon/lime quality about it. A really good bready base with a little bit of biscuit thrown it. A really nice malt/hop balance and a change up from the all-too-typical tropical fruit aroma of IIPA's.  Lots more of the herbal citrus on the taste. It is definitely lemon and lime and also some floral characters. I would best describe it as just ""herby"" and I really think Simcoe hops figure in prominently as they have a very unique aroma and flavor. Assertive bitterness throughout that is wonderful. Lots of bread from the malt with a touch of biscuit. Nearly perfect balance between malt and hop. Mouthfeel is full with a slightly sticky finish. Abv is extremely well hidden and there is no way one would guess this is 8.5%  Overall, another amazing beer from Victory. I have been nothing but impressed by every beer I have had from this brewery. I desperately wish they would distribute to East Tennessee.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,AmitC,4.44,"One of the better double IPAs.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into snifter. Pale yellow to slight golden color. Some haze, but otherwise very clear. Two finger thick off white colored head that stays as a thin layer and persists well. Excellent lacing on the sides with each sip and by head. No bubbles seen. Very calm appearance.  Aroma is full of herbal, ground and earthy hops. A very slight malt backbone gives a tinge of sweetness, which is about to be dispelled. Some minor alcohol. Excellent aroma.  Taste is full of bitterness. Hops have some bitterness, that is more than a lot of other IPAs. Some malt in the middle with hops at the either side. Leaves a very clear dry finish dominated by bitterness. A very good aftertaste that invites for more hops or anything for that matter.  Almost light to medium feel. A little oily towards the end. No apparent astringency, except for hoppy bitterness. Low on carbonation. The carbonation generated tinge is lacking which is good.  Excellent stuff. Buy it.  Style Rate: 4.5 Personal Rate: 4.5",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,GiantMidget,4.55,"Bought at Wegmans in Collegeville PA.  High expectations on this one and it most definitely delivered.  Poured hastily into a tulip glass. The lemon pine evident immediately, heavy on the citrus and very pleasant. Golden haziness in the glass. 1 inch head with lacing that remains throughout, even the headiness stays around for awhile.  And the hops nail my tongue with dryness as soon as I sip. This tremendous hoppiness remains in every swig and stays in the back of the tongue all the while. Bit of bread, malt characteristics and best off all, for a high ABV I find it untraceable.  I could sit and drink this one anytime and I would invest in a case, I'm impressed, Victory, being only about 45 minutes from me, has outdone themselves. I look forward to having this on tap when I visit the brewery next time.  The mouthfeel is a bit heavy on the carbonation but the dry hop slam manages to make that irrelevant.  Hop heads, try this double, it's worth it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ColdWaffles,4.24,"Poured into a standard pint from a 12 oz bottle.  Appearance: Nice light golden color with a substantial white head. Dies after a few minutes, but leaves an excellent lacing.  Smell: Hops, grass, pine. Nothing remarkable, but very evident.  Taste: This tastes last a remarkable session IPA, but it's actually a Double IPA with a higher ABV. If this wouldn't get me trashed very quickly, this would be a favorite session IPA of mine. Regardless, this is excellent and highly recommended. Nice hop flavor with great richness and a good pine flavor. Light citrus notes on the end, and a little alcohol, but not much.  Mouthfeel: Not particularly heavy with appropriate hop levels. Great lightly bitter ""grassy"" aftertaste.

Taste is like the nose- hop focused but not all that intense. Citrus, a soapy flavour, some pine. A bit of caramel malt but very light. Alcohol is well-hidden.  Medium bodied, moderately carbonated, somewhat oily.  Overall, not bad, but despite its strength, this comes across as more of an IPA than a DIPA to me. Close but does not pack the punch that I expected.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,tronester,3.9,"A light golden in color, with a thin off-white head. A mild earthy and citrus aroma. Taste begins with a huge malt blast up front, followed by some resinous hops, then some citrus. Mouthfeel was super rich, but low carbonation.

345,14916,AdamPenna,3.57,"Big melon scent from the first pour's blast. Not much of the piney, citrusy smell I like in an IPA, but eccentric enough to keep me interested. Straw/amber color. Fine, fluffy head. Tastes melony, citrusy, bitter-y, and some pine. Not hoptastic but a very pleasant bitter experience. Some oiliness, dryness, too, in the finish. An admirable mouthfeel. I have to be careful with this because it's 1) delicious and 2) 8.5% ABV. Lacing lasts and rings the glass--a thing I like perhaps more than I should. Served in a Greenport Harbor Brewing pintglass.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,JamesMN,4.26,"Appearance: Clear golden with some visible effervescence slowly ascending towards a finger of bright white foamy head that laces well.  Aroma: Orange citrus and some pine. Not much of a malt presence.  Taste: Piney hops hit the palate first along with a nice moderate bitterness (I'm guessing 75-80 IBUs). Real good barley flavor and a hint of toffee. Finishes with a little citrus and an earthy character. A real nice balance without being too hop forward or a malt bomb. It's expertly done because there is a good amount of bitterness throughout but the malt flavor still comes through. Don't taste any of the 8.5% ABV but get a nice warming in the back of the throat. Comparable to DFH 90 Min.  Mouthfeel: Just above medium in body but never syrupy or sticky like some DIPAs can be. Real easy drinking but more of something you try to savor. Smooth feel despite the bitterness.  Final Thoughts: Pleasantly surprised by this one. A very good (East Coast) IPA. Would I drink it again? Yeah, and since it's a seasonal I'll check it out every year.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,EricLander,3.73,"Good quality beer here. As a general preference, I enjoy piney and bitter hops - and that's precisely why I chose this beer when making my last run.  Based on the date on the bottle, this was bottled up in September - so I'm drinking it a couple months later. Poured, there was a very tall two finger head - not expected.  The aroma was certainly hoppy - but not nearly as strong as I would've thought. Not exactly the wallop I expected. Taste wise though, particularly for a beer of this ABV, it's incredibly smooth. Appearance is decent - but nothing spectacular. A little more golden than I would've expected.  All in all a solid choice for a hoppy ale.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Big bitterness, hop resin, well blended piney earthy and floral hop flavors with a slight citric twang. Bitterness lingers and grows with each sip. Malt body is there just enough to hold hops together for a true hop wallop.

Not a ton of head, but retention on it is excellent. Also, very nice lacing. Lookin' good!  S: Floral hops, sugar, white bread. Nothing too pungent.  T: Hops dominate, some notes of citrus and sweet candy. But the bitterness could be balanced a lot better. Not much malt.  M: Carbonation levels are fine, medium-bodied. Hop oils make this one a little syrupy, but that's to be expected.

345,14916,Mic-Lee,4.66,"A: Nice golden color is mildly cloudy. Decent lacing, medium head.  S: Off the charts amazingly awesome. Smells so good, I had my nose in it for a minute before I even took a sip. Strong hops, fresh herbs plucked straight from the garden. As good as any IPA I've ever smelled.  T: Warm aromatic hops all over the place. Very mild bitterness (my preference). Alcohol is virtually non-present, and at 8.2% that's pretty impressive. Floral, piney, herbal. Terrific hop-forward flavors.  M: Pretty standard, not overly carbonated. I think for brews this well-balanced and flavorful it pays not to carbonate too much. Probably the right amount for the beer, but mouthfeel isn't a standout characteristic for this one.  O: I'm very impressed. Luckily, I found a place nearby that sells this out of the coldbox for $5.99. I will be picking this one up frequently from this point forward. A new favorite.

Not sure what they might be.  S - Floraly hops, some citrus, lemon, some malty/bready notes. However, immediately on sniffing this, there is a soapy note, musty almost. Somewhat off putting.  T - Hmmm... Bitter lead, some malty-ness, theres the hops, lots of lemon rind, But theres that damn soapy overtone again. It just grabs my palate and dominates the flavor...  M - High carb, but not overly so. Good coat, even if its aiding that soapiness mentioned before.  O - I hope I just got a bad bottle (6 pack...). Maybe its just me, however, I had another brew right before this one, which I thought was great. I will certainly give this another chance at some point. Maybe (hopefully) this bottle is an an anomaly and the others in the six pack will be saved. Although my hopes arent high on that. Underneath the soapy weirdness, there seems to be a good beer.

Pure white head that fades to one finger but holds on about half way through  S- I could smell the hops as I poured it. Nice bright grapefruit with spice. Rounded out by some dull pineapple and deep earth wet hop.  T- lives up to the smell, nice rich grapefruit, pineapple, mango, spice and bright green hops. out by a well balanced hop bitterness that hits the back of the pallet just right and doesn't hang around to long. The 8.5% is no where to be found either.  M- Nice and smooth light fluffy body with a low carbonation that floats right over the tongue.  O- overall I think this is one of my favorite American double ipa's. The flavors of the fresh fruits in the hops combined with the way the bitterness goes as fast as it comes but has enough time to really taste the bitterness makes it insanely drinkable.

S: Mostly citrus with some tropical fruit and floral aromas. Grapefruit, sweet mango, a bit of tangerine. A bit of sweet malt in the background.  T: Very nice. The tropical, citrus and floral hop flavors from the aroma mesh together wonderfully. The amount of malt is just about perfect for my preference.

Taste is the same, malt, piney hops a bit stronger perhaps, spices including pepper and a faint whiff of vanilla, I think.

345,14916,JimsArcade,3.62,"A recipe that changed drastically after it's initial release... for the better. Not that the original version didn't have its merits. (I miss the fresh-cut lawn smell and taste of that recipe and its extreme bitterness.) This new version is much more balanced, though ultra-hop-heads may want look elsewhere as Victory has muted the hop profile since its first recipe. If anything, this is a great starter IIPA now.  Surprisingly pale for an IIPA, hops and alcohol dominate the nose. The bitterness is countered by a malt sweetness that makes this beer quite drinkable (DEADLY drinkable on cask as it's so smooth).  (This review is based on my experience of the beer as it comes from a bottle, my most-frequent sampling. On draft, taste and overall would score and extra 0.5 each. On cask, where Hop Wallop truly shines: taste, mouthfeel and overall would get a 1.0 bump each.)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Sheets and huge notches of lacing.  Smell: Some pine. Grapefruit flesh and some oily zest. Slight resin. Malts are big, chewy, and slightly sweet. Some mild roasted malts. Touches of caramel sweetness. Really smells like bread dough dusted with hops. Mildly herbal as it warms. Pithy.  Taste: Pithy floral hops. Like drinking flower petals.

Warms and some of the sweetness drops. Juicy, oily hops. Dry biscuits and crackers.  Mouthfeel: Slick, oily mouthfeel. Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Smmoth and a touch creamy.  Overall: Hippies had a hand in this.  So floral it's crazy. Like a pithy flower perfume. Less than desirable in the long run.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Settles quickly leaving a thick blanket of foam on the surface, and a hefty beer ring. Thick beer ring lacing remains as you drink it down.  S: Pine, lavender, and basil.  T: Sharp biting pine and pecan shells. Just a very slight hint of something sweet for balance.  M: Full and syrupy feel, very sharp bite in the front and throughout. Bitter, dry finish.  D: Sipping pace will be dictated by the harsh bite.  Atmosphere is solid. Nice body, great color, substantial head, and lots of lacing. Nose is simple, but very strong combination of pine, flora, and spice. Flavor, in turn, is simple but full-on.... pine and bitter pecan shells.

Smell: This is a noseful of citrus and tropical hops. Lots of orange, lemon, and grapefruit. It's one to really appreciate the smell.  Taste: Big fruity and citrus hops. The hops completely dominate your taste-buds, but in a way any hop-lover is a big fan of.  Mouthfeel: Sticky and chewy and very full.  Overall: This is one of my favorite Imperial IPAs. It hits everything you're looking for in this style: Big on the nose and even bigger in flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

A latticework of lace forms around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, malt, and alcohol. Taste is pretty sweet and is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, and a malty finish. There is a fairly high level of citrus zest bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Floral hops and fresh cut grass lead on taste. Slight caramel and citric grapefruit and lemon follow. Very smooth finish. Well rounded and hop heavy. Nice job.

A Dogfish Head Fisheye pint glass presents the peppery hops, light funk, and some pine bark while lemon and faint pineapple linger in the background.  On entry, one finds lemon and pepper with grapefruit building in the middle to a strong, bitter finish. Spices, while light at first, become more prominent with warmth as does the sweetness.  A medium to full body with light carbonation. Alcohol is as expected in this ultimately dry IPA.  Hop Wallop is a decent hoppy beer to be enjoyed while relaxing after a day’s work.

Clear gold color with a one finger white head.  S: Smell is a full bouquet of hops. I pick up strong pine, grapefruit, and raw leafy hops.  T: This is a hop-lovers dream. It's all of the hop flavors you would ever want to encounter with the absolute minimum malt holding it back. Additionally, there is a huge lack of bitterness...it's just all hops. Strong pine and grapefruit, with a bit of grass backing it up, and a ghostly trace of malt. It's not sweet, but it's not bitter. Also as others have mentioned, how they got this beer to 8.5% is one of the greatest mysteries known to man.  M: Medium-thin body, crisp, no perception of alcohol. This is the easiest drinking 8.5% beer that I've ever had.  O: One of my favorite DIPAs. As I said, you get all the hops you could ever want without any malt obstruction. Additionally, it's so amazingly balanced that it's not sweet, but it's not intensely bitter.  It's considered year round, but it's still tough to find reliably.

The head remains large for a quite a long time, holding some fine retention.  S - Hops, citrus, hints of alcohol and some light pine. Lots of subtlety here, but all refreshing.  T - Big bitter hops start the beer off and the recede into a piney hop oil. Loads of grapefruit here, most of the sweetness from the nose is vacant.

345,14916,Kromes,4.33,"Clear yellow straw color with a thick white head. Not very often that you see a light colored Double IPA. A very floral and candy-like citrus and pine hop aroma.  Pine, floral and citrus hops dominate the flavor. The sweet malt stays way in the background and provides just enough sweetness. Finish is dry and bitter with lingering pine and citrus peel flavors.  Feel is spicy and peppery from the hops and alcohol. This is my kind of DIPA. It is not overboard on the toasted and caramel malt flavors. Purely hop in the flavor with some fruity esters and alcohol.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

It leaves a ring around the edges with good lacing. Deep gold color. Hazy.  S- First thing I notice is malt followed by some citrus hops.  T- The hops are up front, bitter with a peppery flavor in the finish. The malt sneaks in the middle to balance things out.  M- Smooth but on the thin side for a DIPA.  O- I can't say this is an outstanding DIPA but style points aside, this is a very good beer that goes down way too easy for something with an 8.5 ABV.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Oakenator,4.47,Well balanced double IPA. Golden in color with a slight hint of amber. Smell is terrific with clear hop presence but also smells of a caramel malt.

S: Piny, minty and citric hop nose ... strength in that order and a burst of hints of fruit...  T: Smooth and slick with a medium body... Bitterness is aggressive but not abusive, hop flavor jumps from herbal / tobacco to pine resin to mint to citric...  M: Nothing hot here, alcohol is noticeable for sure but it does not get in the way...malts are somewhat noticable too (but not as much as many DIPAs have been using)... slab of bread, toasted a bit. Finishes with a big hop flavor and lingering bitterness as well as the alcohol warmth.  D: I was suprised this was an imperial IPA/American Double...Reason being, the VERY light color, as well as the lack of body...most 'doubles' tend to have a darker, richer color, with a heavier body...I do appreciate this beer's drinkability...It's pretty smooth and refreshing...I just don't think I'm as big a fan of DIPAs as I was a year (or so) ago...I think I'll stick with standard IPAs...Chasin' Cheers :~)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Real small carbonation bubbles. Thin layer of head the entire glass.  S: Fairly faint, might be an older bottle. Almost as much raisin as there is hop.  T: This one was actually a really nicely balanced double IPA. Of course there is the bitters you would expect, but the sweet malt backbone on this really adds to it. Mostly a citrus/grapefruit hop.  M: Medium to full body for the style. Still has a crisp carbonation though. Slight nectar feel. Alcohol is very well hidden.  Overall an excellent double IPA. Goes down pretty easy then creeps back up to slow you down. Another victory for the brewery.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,paytonpowell,4.25,A: An amazing golden hued straw color with a thick creamy white head that rests open the hazy body. This is what I want all my Imperial IPA's to look like.  S: An initial blast of Clementine fruit followed by a resinous pine smell. unlike other Imperial IPA's the sweetness in the nose isn't followed by a thick caramel scent but is light and brisk and refreshing. Hints of freshly cut grass definitely linger in the background.  T: Wonderfully balanced sweet citric flavors roll across the tongue grassy resinous follow soon there after and the aftertaste smacks of Sauvignon Blanc.  M: Crisply carbonated and very refreshing medium-light body with well balanced acidity and nary a hint of thick caramel feel found in others of this style.  O: I am not a big IPA fan in general and tend to be skeptical of all but a handful of Imperial/Double IPA's so the Hop Wallop really stood out to be because it was so different. I love the fact that most of the caramel notes and feelings found in others are absent from this and that this is also reflected in its amazing coloring. Instead of wickedly bitter and dank like it was so balanced and citrus oriented it totally caught me off guard. I think that this is a great beer and well worth the slightly higher price tag.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Mouthfeel:   Medium bodied beer.  Good carbonation.  Overall:  Very well balanced IPA.  Fairly simple hop profile.  Easy drinking beer for 8.5 percent ABV.

345,14916,JerzDevl2000,3.91,"Picked this up in Totowa yesterday, since I amazingly had not gotten around to this yet. I've had a lot of beers in this and other hoppy styles and wasn't sure what to expect out of this, given that it has so many reviews on here. While this didn't stand out as much as I had hoped, it's a quality beer that represents the style well and is strong enough without feeling or tasting like booze!  The pour was the best aspect to this, with a creamy white head that lingered for a while. Lots of lacing too that left rings around my glass after each sip. The consistency of this was soapy and the hue was nice rich amber, with a bit of cloudiness down the center of the glass. Certainly, I hadn't had anything that looked quite like this when it came to DIPA's! As for the taste, it was nicely balanced with a slightly sugary malt and pine, grapefruit, rind, pineapple, and a bit of mango in the taste. The hops are strong but subtle with the earthy citrus lingering in the aftertaste. This isn't a West Coast beer but it's not that far from it either. The burn is missing but the bitterness is there, and enduring.  Sure enough, this is strong and you'll feel it by the end of the drinking session. The carbonation could have been a bit higher but the mouthfeel was sufficient enough not to need a scrubbing between each sip to help cleanse the palate. This is a solid take on the style and beer worth trying once, even if you're not a hophead. Once again, Victory has another solid offering on their hands!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,tewaris,3.57,"Clear golden with generally good looks. Smells like sweaty socks at times. Tastes good but not as Double IPA-ish as Saison like. Go figure. Not the most bitter I have had but the bitterness lingers and sometimes borders on unpleasant. Also, what's the deal with the solvent character? Good mouthfeel on this one though, they got the FG and the carbonation spot on.

S- Not as strongly hoppy smelling as I was expecting. Theres some pine some pineapple. Very sugary sweet. A sugary grainy malt backbone. Its pleasant but with a name like hop wallop, its underwhelming.  T- The hops are definetely more so in the flavor. This beer hits you with a crisp bitterness and follows up with a piney and citrusy hop profile. It includes lemon, pineapple, pine, peach and works very well with the malts. The malts are grainy, metallic, sugary, clean and work very nice with the hops.  M- Bitter, and the aftertaste is also very bitter. This beer is pretty warming. It has a full feel and a lasting aftertaste. It drinks pretty smoothly for a DIPA.  O- No real complaints about this one. Its a good east coast double.

345,14916,deadonhisfeet,3.75,"Poured from a bottle into a New Belgium snifter. The beer pours out very clear, light amber with low carbonation. The head is thin and dissipates quickly. The nose is quite faint and not as punchy as I thought it would be. I get subtle notes of citrus and pine.  Flavor-wise? This is one bitter beer. There's not much balancing malt sweetness to speak of at all. You get a brief flavor of toast and marmalade on the front of the palate, then a very intense rush of grapefruit bitterness joins in. At mid-palate, the grapefruit is joined by the pine flavors promised by the nose and they both keep drilling your tastebuds all the way through a nice, dry, sustained finish. The mouthfeel is firm and slick.  This IIPA is very bitter and has a nice hop presence, but it's kind of a one-trick pony. The grapefruit flavors are so intense they don't allow many other flavors to develop and this compromises the complexity of the beer. I like IIPAs as much as the next BA, but I can't compare this to something like FFF Dreadnaught with its myriad of flavors (orange, lemon, mango). This is a nice beer, but it's not a top-shelf IIPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

STYLE: Double/Imperial IPA  ABV: 8.5%  LOOK: Musty orange, cloudier than expected. Off-beat peanut. The carbonated but creamy head dissolves nicely with above-average lacing and retention.  NOSE: The gem. Floral, orange peel, sweet tangerine, grapefruit. I’m glad I skipped that afternoon nap in favor of this tasting session. Even if I wanted to, I couldn’t do it now. The sweet, piney, hop-filled aroma has me alive and well.  MOUTH: Candied orange slices with a lemon-pine spritz. The grapefruit comes to the fore as it warms. I recommend letting this one sit for a few minutes before imbibing. The hoppy, floral notes are stronger on the nose than in the mouth. The 8.5% ABV is well masked by a refined, almost idyllic, finish. You don’t want it to linger any longer, and it doesn’t.

The taste is amazing - somewhat sweet, bitter, hoppy with grapefruit, citrus, and pine. With an ABV of 8.5%, it was surprisingly smooth and not overpowering.

345,14916,ThisWangsChung,4.38,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.  A: Pours a healthy golden amber color with moderate yeast haze. The head is a two finger faintly offwhite color with an incredibly thick texture and excellent retention. Very strong lacing in spots.  S: A lot of tropical fruit in the nose, but not an insane amount. Still, mango, grapefruit, and pineapple are incredibly evident on the nose, along with a subtle touch of caramel malt. Subdued but very nice.  T: This isn't like other DIPAs I'm used to. Rather than overloading the palate with ""MOAR HOPS"" and ""MOAR BITTER"" (looking at you Hoptimum, as much as I love you), this has a very subtle tropical fruit note throughout the sip with little finishing bitterness. At times, it reminds me of unsweetened grapefruit juice. I also detect a hint of fruity esters near the finish, too. The biscuity malt backbone keeps the hops in check without coming across as overpowering. This features fantastic balance throughout; it's never exceedingly bitter, yet it isn't sweet at all. Very easy to drink for a DIPA to the point of being dangerous. And this is an older bottle! Imagine how good this will be fresh!  M: It's actually fairly oily on the tongue (leaving some of its resiny texture, and eventually, some piny bitterness on the aftertaste), but it's light and effervescent enough to go down with incredible ease. Only a hint of the alcohol appears after a while.  O: I'd put this up there with Hop Stoopid, easily - or maybe even slightly above it. If there were ever a poster child for the preaching subtlety and balance in a DIPA without being boring, this would be it.

Such a delicious smell that I must admit, my mind and nose were blown. Hops, some flowery notes that reminded me of tea, I think? One of the most mouth-watering beers I've ever smelled.  T: Damn, this is mind-blowing. A very hoppy brew with some strange, exciting sweetness. It reminded me of Deschutes' Hop Henge, but slightly less sugary.  M: Refreshing but strong, the flavor lingers and just makes you want to ... no ... makes you HAVE to keep lifting the glass to your lips. Man, this is a near-perfection brew.  O: I've never really been into IPAs, but this beer is a perfect example of why I keep coming back to them.  Bubbly, the alcohol becomes slightly more apparent",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,JKuras,4.03,"First review on BA!  Appearance: Pours with a nice generous fluffy 2 1/2 finger head that dissipates slowly and still very much present halfway through. Golden orange in color and moderately cloudy. Looks freaking delicious.  Smell: Honeysuckle, apples, pears, fresh cut flowers, perfume, lots of hops obviously present. Smell is not as overpowering as I was expecting (from a Double IPA).  Taste: Sweet caramel malts, quickly followed by a nice fruity, spicy and very bitter pine hop finish. Alcohol is very well hidden behind the stack of hops, but also compromises any more subtle flavors coming through from the malts. The hops bitterness lingers at least a minute or two after drinking.  Mouthfeel: Nice moderate carbonation with a relatively heavy mouthfeel for an IPA.  Overall: B+ Very solid, but there are ones I’ve liked better. Lives up to its name. Not the most complex Double IPA I’ve had but very tasty.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ThePorterSorter,4.05,"Goblet full of a clear amber beer with a thin white head and little lacing. Aromas of pine and citrus break through with a menacingly well hidden ethanol. The taste is a light sweetness with a balanced, lingering hoppiness. Very excellent aftertaste for a DiPA, modest hoppiness and very drinkable. This beer will definitely hit your hop craving spot.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Shrews,4.35,"Served - Bottle poured into a Pint Glass  Appearance Very nice head, about 1/2 inch thick. Overall color of the beer looks consistent and light. Leaves pronounced rings of head around the sides of the glass as you drink it.  Smell Hoppy smell not too strong, not too light, with hints of citrus.  Taste Hoppy, but not sour. After you swallow you can taste the hops on your throat and especially on the back of your tongue. Long after a drink you'll continue to taste the hops on the back of your tongue. This is great. Citrusy, almost grapefruit taste. Taste is very consistent.  Mouthfeel Extremely smooth and consistent in the mouth while tasting. Taste spreads around your mouth perfectly. Very consistent throughout the whole glass.  Overall Consistent and slightly citrus IPA. The citrus taste masks the strong hops taste of the common IPAs. A great Double IPA and a must try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Smells like honey and some of that comes through on the palate in a good way, which is otherwise really clean and refreshing. Drank this in a smoky bar, so not sure what else I may have missed. The bitterness kicks in in the aftertaste in a sort of disjointed or disconnected way. Unharmonius.

345,14916,Darkmagus82,3.88,"I had had this beer long ago in bottle form, and then recently had it on tap. I was quite disappointed with the tap tasting as I was remembering something much better. I have decided to give it another go, this time in the bottle form I remembered liking well.  Poured from bottle into pint glass  Appearance - Pours a medium golden color with a huge white head. This was very different from the tap serving I had which had almost no head at all. The white billowy head sat with persistence for some time before fading to give a fair amount of lacing.  Smell – The nose is a bit on the lighter side with a base of caramel sweetness, buiscuit , and a medium citrus hop aroma. A very light pine is also present.  Taste – Up front there is a biscuit base that is mixed with some citrus hop flavors and a caramel sweetness. These flavors create a base for the brew as they are present throughout. More toward the middle the caramel intensifies and is mixed with a lighter bit of pine hop flavor. The caramel flavor then begins to lose ground and the citrus and pine surge at the end, leaving a pleasant bitter on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body is on the creamier side with a moderate level of carbonation. Pretty good and pleasurable on both fronts with the carbonation exciting and the creaminess soothing the tongue thus allowing the hop flavors to bath the tongue a bit more.  Overall – Now this was what I remembered!! It was vastly better then my previous encounter on tap, which when looking back at the lack of carbonation may have been an end of the keg pour. This time I was much more pleased with my drinking experience as this brew is quite tasty and does have some very nice characteristics.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,cbutova,3.91,"I have definitely had this one before, if not a few times. I suppose I just never got around to reviewing it previously. Best by date is 01/23/2013, hopefully that means it is reasonably fresh.  A- Light yellow ale poured into a pint glass with a white cap. Head forms to a nice two-finger size and retains very well. Creamy thick texture to the head. Big, bold rings of lace spiral down the glass.  S- Not the biggest nose for a Double IPA. I mostly get citrus/orange/lemon zest hops, some bread and a bit of caramel.  T- Hop forward with citrus, pine, orange zest, lemon, floral, herbal, earthy and slight tropical fruit notes. I would have to say that citrus and pine are the big things here. Backing of caramel malt and bread.  MF Big and creamy body with silky moderate level of carbonation. Finishes with a nice, clean bitterness.  Reminds me of the IPA/Doubles before the huge peachy fruit flavor was so popular. It brings a great citrus and pine flavor that satisfies my hop needs.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Aroma is tangerine, pineapple, and other tropical citrus. Nice fresh hoppy aroma, some fusel alcohol.  Taste is pale biscuity malt laced with a honey sweetness, booze, and tropical bitter hops.  Mouthfeel is a little sticky, chewy. Coats the tongue, finishes sharp and bitter.  Overall a pretty solid DIPA. Booze not hidden especially well and just a tad malt-forward for my taste, but still unquestionably an enjoyable, well-crafted beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,hopsolutely,4.2,"Perhaps one of the nicest DIPA's I've enjoyed - bursting with flavour, but still light and refreshing. Highly recommend!  Pours a dark golden colour with an impressive, airy head and resultant lacing. Aroma of citrus ""west-coast"" hops is the mildest sensory element for me - this beer really shines in its taste. Citrus, pine and tropical fruit in the front of the palate followed by a nicely balanced caramelized malt fullness, that transitions into a brilliantly lingering hop bitterness with citrus undertones.  Brilliant!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Lots of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass  S: Get a lot of orange rind upfront with the typical grapefruit kind of smells going on also. Also get a lot of pine and really floral notes  T: Pretty big hop bitterness with lots of citrus and flowers. It then, sort of fades into a nice sweet maltiness with some caramel  M: Really creamy, mid-high carbonation. Get a nice tingly bite from the floral hops  Overall this is a really good one.

S: I'm getting a lot of cut grass in this beer. Some bread and caramel filled malts as well as a little grain. Some citrus, but surprisingly little for a hoppy DIPA.  T: The beer itself has a lot of the notes of the aroma. Surprising lack of bright hop character. That's not to say that they aren't there, I do get some of the piney, resiny notes but nothing floral and really not too much citrus. That being said there is a decent amount of malt in this beer. Grainy and caramel mostly but there is still a bit of bread. Not too bad, but not great.  M: Nice carbonation and a smooth medium body.  O: A surprisingly ordinary beer. For some reason I thought much more of this before. Maybe I got an old or bad bottle? Very ordinary for a DIPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Pours a beautiful golden color with huge aromatics of pineapple, pine, lemon peel, and other citrus. Flavor follows with less punch than a Hopslam, but similar flavor profile and light on the palate. This has a nicely balanced sweetness and is excellent on tap. Bottle was less exciting. Smell is divine. Clear golden color.

O - I like the beer. However, it is definitely not a favorite as far as an IPA goes. Would I get it again? Sure, but not if there is a palate wrecker on the taplist.

I'm loving the hop profile, especially as it warms. Very piney up front, then sweet. The alcohol is present in the finish. I can't get over the lacing...absolutely gorgeous rings down the glass!

It tastes like...plastic? Ozone? Moonshine? It's not pleasant. Fortunately, there are some pleasant, oily hops; full fruit; and a creamy mouthfeel. The aftertaste is void of this noxious intrusion and suggests this might once have been a grand beer.  O: Willing to try again, but, as is, unrecommendable. I wonder what happened to my bottle. 5/20 EDIT: I tried it again, and am willing to bump taste from 2.0 to 2.5.

Good, but not exactly bowling me over. Hops are pleasant but I expected more malt.  T: Pretty chock full of hops... actual bitter hops, which I find rare in beers touted as hop bombs. The actual flavor of the hops is quite lemony, resinous, and fruity/floral (apple, honeysuckle), in that order. Lots of oils stick to the tongue in a long, bitter finish. Malt is quite sweet underneath, tasting like caramel candy. Spiciness, almost like rye, pervades the experience as well.  M: Just a bit on the thin side for the style, but not critically so.

T- Good bitter ""hop wallop"" as advertised both up front and on the finish. There IS some sweetness mixed in there though so it's not too punishing. I detect a little citrus/grapefruit along with some grassy character.  M- Medium body and good mid to high carbonation. Smooth drinking though a little dry on the finish (amplified by the bitterness).  O- A solid easy drinking IPA with a hop bite.

345,14916,Blargimus,4,"12 oz bottle poured into tulip. I'm pretty sure it says ""enjoy by October 19, 2012"" on the label, which seems pretty extreme for an IPA, especially since I bought this at least 2.5 months ago. The last bottle of the six-pack, so I guess I'd better review this one!  Pours a bright orange-straw with 2 fingers of white head. Crystal-clear, lots of carbonation bubbles. Leaves a very pretty, very thick lacing on the glass as it falls.  Smells great, actually. Much better than I was expecting. Perhaps it was the unintentional fridge-aging, but the malts come through pretty strongly. They're still in the back seat, but definitely noticeable, which I like. When I was drinking it fresh, I remember the hops completely dominating everything.  Even though I was worried about the age on this one, trust me, the hops are definitely still there. It hits you right up front with strong bitterness, and then moves into grapefruit and pine. Not subtle, but tasty. It's also extremely malty, which I LOVE.  The high carbonation in this gives it a creaminess that keeps it from being too sweet. Finishes pretty dry for something with this much sugar in it. Bitterness sticks around.  I have a weakness for IPAs with a strong malt background, so I liked this much better with a little age on it. Fours all the way across the board.

Truly a big perfume in taste as well as smell, but it's a fine mellow fog. Countered by the crisp touch of acidity. Bitterness is a nice part of the flavor, but it's very rich and malty in the aftertaste. Long nose of apples and flowers (stocks?).  Would be educational to see exactly what they put in this.

345,14916,BarryMFBurton,3.51,"Working my way through the Victory ranks; so far, so good. I’ve never had this one, but just the name Hop Wallop sounded too good to pass up. Hit it!  Still has a good 9 months before the “Enjoy By” date, so we should be good to go.  A: A mix of straw yellow and rich gold leave the bottle with a noticeable glow, followed by a tumultuous field of bubbles that flies up from the glass’s bottom – they never die down. The head is pretty contained, getting to an eggshell-colored inch or so before moving to a strangely bumpy retention (raised in some parts, lowered in others). Smooth lacing all the way around.  S: Not a citrus bomb: it’s definitely flowery, grassy, and with just a touch of lemon. Pretty juicy, though they leave enough room for the grains. A barley, almost potato chip aroma leaves the most lasting impression on this nose, though it finishes out with an odd funk, almost like old plastic. It really takes over the end of the nose, and not in a good way.  T: First taste is that lame plastic note again, but it’s (thankfully) fleeting: bold hops, piney and grassy, envelop the palate without so much as a transition. Light, bready malts swim around beneath, with leafy, toasted flavors out front. Afterwards there’s a bit of lemon peel, grapefruit, orange rind, and sweet cream. Aftertaste is fruit juiciness and more dry leafiness. Plastic on the end at times, but not incredibly big.  M: Drinkable as hell for a double; watch out. Goes down with the faintest pop and a mild creaminess.  O: Good, but I’d like to have it again to see if I get another plastic flavor.

This tastes like an IPA mixed in a three to one ratio with straight grapefruit juice. It's good and very unique.  Mouthfeel: Nothing amazing nor disappointing. Good carbonation and a nice body.

O: Overal Victory's best attempt at an IPA, the Hop Devil and other one's are ehhhh.. at best.

345,14916,Drinkerofales,4.32,"Pours lightly murky gold with straw highlights. A large white head makes some nice lacing.  Smell is tropical fruit and citrus hops. Big and bold.  Flavor is crisp bitter citrus up front which tails of to the suggestion of malt. A bitter finish rounds out the taste.  Texture is clean with high carbonation that has some sting and tingle.  A great beer, bold in flavor, aroma and texture. I will enjoy this again.  DOA",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,blackcompg,4,"Poured from their 12oz bottle...  Appearance - Poured nearly 3 fingers of fluffy, bumpy off-white eggshell head, color of the beer is a glowing hazy golden lite orange color. Some very nice lacing is left when finished.  Smell - Whoah, orange, mango, papaya, pineapple, grapefruit, and sweet lemon - such phenomenal citrus smells!  Taste - Just like the nose, all of these wonderful citrus and tropical flavors come together with a natural citrus sweetness, along with some big green and floral hop flavors. There is a wonderful malted biscuit backbone in the background, and the finish is slightly bitter and dry with wonderful dried grapefruit peel and a touch of pine.  Mouthfeel - Mouthfeel is medium+, very smooth, and some juiciness. Carb is on the lower side, but adds some tingly edges along the sides of the tongue, but not enough to ""cleanse"" the palate, you're left with some nice lingering citrus flavors between sips, with juicy pockets in the corners of the mouth. The finish is just slightly dry and bitter.  Overall - A really nice citrussy and floral DIPA. The sweetness is all from the citrus, and is not overly sweet at all, and doesn't come across as honey or carmel or hard candy as in other DIPA's. A very nice DIPA, and one that I would try again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

T: Notes of pine, lemon, grapefruit, tangerine, bitter orange, lime, kumquat, papaya, mango, and pineapple are balanced by firm biscuit notes. The finish is resinous and bitter with strong notes of lemon, lime, pine, and grapefruit.  M: Medium-to-full in body and very dry for the style with firm carbonation. Alcohol presence is minimal.  O: This is an excellent DIPA with an abundance of hop flavor. If you consider yourself a hop head and haven't given this one a shot, then I would recommend doing so in the near future.

I got a citrus/pine taste, with a bitter after taste. Pine hops are everywhere. refreshingly pleasant overall  M- Bitter, good carbonation. Hits you sharp on the first sip  O- one of the best DIPA's I have had, although I am still new to the craft brew scene.

Good retention and circular lacing, some sediment at the bottom of the glass.  S: Lush deep sacharine fruits like mango, pineapple, orange juice box.  T: Love the sweet fruit nose going in for the sip followed by a much more bitter taste: citrus zest and serious hop bitterness on the backburner.  M: Props for not being too syrupy like others in the style can get. A little carbonation prickles the tongue just enough. Finishes clean with a lingering bitterness.

Nice retention and lace...a great looking brew.  Nose is bright, floral hops with a fair amount of crackery malt...think Kashi TLC snack crackers. Clean yeast and the alcohol is nowhere to be found.  Hops are sweet, bitter and floral as all hell with more of an emphasis on bitter than flavor. Malt stays light and pretty much gets the hell outta the way, although it contributes a significant sweetness. Whereas this beer was cutting edge 10 years ago, now there are dozens of DIPAs that have surpassed it. Although, I must say, it can still hold its own impressively...Like MJ playing for the Wizards, he was still better than half the players on the floor. Still worth a purchase here and there and is a good value at 10.99 a sixer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Carbonation level was fair. Had noticeable sediment.  Smell: Herbal and fruity hops – very reminiscent of Sierra Nevada Torpedo; A clean and fresh aroma. Some faint cracker notes were in the mix. Hops certainly dominated the nose.  Taste: First was a hoppy grapefruit with some apricot. Then a sweet candy sugar hit. The finish was a very mild hop bitterness mixed with a reoccurring sweetness – like an overly ripened grapefruit. Aftertaste was of a warm herbal hop that slowly faded. The palate was actually way lighter than I was expecting, given the name ‘Hop Wallop'.  This beer was basically a SN Torpedo without the malt bill and a slightly higher ABV. It seemed to lack the complexity and balance that Torpedo has. Hops just completely dominated this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

T: nice taste, hops up front but pair nicely with some sweetness from the malt, finishes refreshingly bitter.  M: nice, between crisp and smooth, pretty dry, good carbonation, no heat.  O: a very good ale, very well balanced. It's not a grapefruity piney hop atomic bomb but does have a strong hop-forward presence with great balance. Definitely approachable for a DIPA.

Lemony citrus delicious nose. Even at 3 months old this is a wallop on your tongue. Big citrus with a little pine, resin, slam the tongue. Malts and alcohol try to resuscitate the taste buds, adding light sweetness. On the lighter end of the DIPA spectrum with good carbonation. An excellent beer. A victory for Victory.

M - Very sharp and prickly mouthfeel. Well carbonated with good texture.  O - Hop Wallop is a very well done east coast DIPA with significant hops and a dry finish.

345,14916,buzzedup,4.55,This is one of those beers that you have to buy when you see it. The color of the beer is deep golden yellow surprisingly lighter than the hop devil The smell is pure hop and flowers reminds me of spring very sweet on the nose. The mouth fill is meduim with a oily feel as it goes down the throat. Thicker in body than the color would lead to believe . The taste is just what you want from a IPA. Very well balanced not to malty at all (they way I prefer my IPA) This is a must try beer for anyone out there that likes a good well crafted IPA . More eastern IPA for sure over a west coast but a must have for for any hop head,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,thecheapies,4.03,"12oz bottle, marked 'ENJOY BY OCT 19, 2012', poured into a wide snifter.  *Side-by-side tasting with Bell's Hopslam*  Huge off-white head fell to flowery tesselating lace all around the glass. Enchanting golden amber body. Looks friggin' delicious.  Blend of spicy, floral, and citric hops. Some pine needle aromatics in there, too. I'm not kidding, there must be a massively diverse hop addition list. I'm going to look this up right now. Bready malt essence buttressing the hop aromas.  Hops are more pine/floral in the taste. Nice marriage of bitter and sweet. The malts are pretty big here. Bready and sweet lightly toasted pale grains. A little caramel in the middle, and the finish is bitter and spicy. The alcohol is hardly a factor. A very 'East Coast' interpretation of an Imperial IPA.  Medium body. Light-medium carbonation. Still kind of fizzy on the tongue. Alcohol is very well-hidden. I could easily drink a heavy pour of this out of an imperial pint glass, no problem.  I enjoy picking this brew up every winter. It's well-crafted, satisfyingly bitter, and (eventually) heady. In a good way.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,scarfield,4.45,"App- The first thing that struck me was the clarity of the beer. This beer is golden in color and holds a thick head of over an inch, which fades down into a film as a moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass.  Smell- Hops, obviously, both piney and citrus, with a bit of sweetness detectable as well.  Taste- The taste of the beer has quite a bit of sweetness to it, recognizable before the hops overwhelm the senses. The taste of the hops follow the smell. Aftertaste is quite bitter, and also grassy.  Mouthfeel- Quite balanced. Carbonation is fairly active, if anything the beer shades toward thin.  Overall- Very enjoyable as not much alcohol is detected at all, and if you enjoy the flavor of a highly hopped beer it could be quite sneaky.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Smells super hoppy, with fresh floral hops, piney hops, citrus hops, flowers, grapefruit, orange peel, caramel, sweet malt and grains; basically this nose is all hops, and very enjoyable like fresh hops were squeezed into this brew.  Tastes like it smells, with floral hops, piney hops, citrus hops, flowers, herbs, grapefruit, orange peel, lemon, caramel, sweet malt, grains, wet bread and biscuit; mostly hops, the malts add just enough balance to let your taste-buds recover before the sizzling bitter finish that leaves a lingering grapefruit taste.  Mouthfeel is oily, crisp and chewy, with a medium body, mild carbonation and an acidic feel and aftertaste that is bitter.  A true American DIPA that attacks your palate and rewards it with fine hoppy flavors that are complex and hide the ABV quite well.

After that you get citrus notes such as orange, lemon, grapefruit, also a bit of the pine notes found in the aroma. There's so much bitterness in this that there really isn't much malt that comes through, but that's not a bad thing.  M - Medium body, fairly sticky, coating your mouth with pure hop resin.

It is a wallop of hops, indeed, but there's a sweetness that finishes you off just perfectly, too, as the hops recede. I guess it's -supposed- to be bitter through and through, but I think the balance here is divine. Bitter, hoppy, sweet, bready... ah. Marvelous.  Perfect carbonation.

T: Wow! What this beer lacks in appearance it makes up for in taste. Big flavorful bursts of citrus, pine, orange peel and grapefruit condition the tongue for superb bitterness that hi-jacks your tastebuds. I would definitely say this brew is more balanced towards hops, which is exactly what I want in a DIPA in the first place.  M: Medium-full bodied. Sticky and slick with moderate, but necessary, carbonation.  O: This superb brew is a hop-head's dream. It's extremely flavorful and just-plain solid.

Malts come in and add some toasted bread with caramel sweetness. Sweetness definitely cuts the bitterness, but does not balance it out.

Smell - A little piney, citrus, and farmhouse. The farmhouse smell is less favorable and represents more of a wet barnyard. Something smells off or unpleasant.  Taste - Refreshing especially in the front! A hoppier Imperial but not so much that it knocks me off my feet like the label indicates it may. Definitely has the pine and citrus (grapefruit) of a typical IPA and would compete well with a hop headed west coast IPA. A strong bitter aftertaste that lingers like a single guy at last call.

345,14916,minterro,4.33,"Sixer mixer from Oades  A & S: foggy straw colored beer. Bright white head that pour about a finger and a half. The head dies a bit but it’s retained pretty well throughout the beer. smell is primarily citrus hops and maltyness (which is odd because the maltyness doesn’t really come through in the taste).  T & M: This is interesting. I like the fact that it’s a double that doesn’t have a whole lot of sweetness. Upfront isn’t pretty bitter and piney. It’s the sweetest in the middle, also has nice citrus (liney) tones here. The finish is great: citrus (oranges and grapefruit) and piney bitternes, it’s a bit dry. In the middle grounds as far as carbonation (pretty sharp), the higher end of a medium bodied beer.

Aroma: A piney, hoppy bouquet with hints of melon, grapefruit and toffy.  Taste: A strong malt backbone from start to finish with a creamy body, topped by some potent bitterness that really get going towards the middle and ends up fairly harsh by the finish, which is lingering and a bit unpleasant. After a few sips the aroma gets a bit katty.  The Rest: A decent beer lacking a bit in the balance department. There's a great, malty base in there that unfortunate gets overwhelmed by some over the top bitterness.

Smells: a lemon hop smell that has a wet hop kind of smell.  Tastes: there is a citrus hop that is bitterly tasteful with sweet notes to it.  Mouthfeel: this is a crisp well carbonated IPA that doesn't taste like it has 8.5%. the carbonation is great and lasts as I enjoyed it.  Overall: I really enjoy this brew.

S: Noble hop aroma with some sweet honey malt undertones. Hearthy, spicy, slightly fruity. Smells straight German, very fresh.  T: Noble, spicy hops up front with a creamy smooth honey taste on the back.  M: Bitter for a quick second from the hops, not so much the carbonation. Malts are light which let the hop presence shine while nothing is too dominant while still being potent.  O: Lacely film residue sticks thick after each sip, full-flavored, extremely well balanced. A nice change up, not your typical American IPA in regard to a heavy German influence.

345,14916,TheAlamoWrocker,4.39,"Reviewed November 9th 2011. Poured a 12 oz bottle, enjoy by June 29th 2012, into a Snifter glass.  A: Poured a one fingered head while being a beautiful amber with carbonation rising. The carbonation is rising throughout the Snifter equally which is rare for carbonation rising and some carbonation even sits at the base of the glass. This also laces beautifully down the glass.  S: Smells beautifully hoppy, but it's not as strong as I thought it was gonna be with this brews name. You could even pick up some nice sweetness in the nose which are the malts. I was hoping for more smell, but what can one do?  T: The hops in this are interesting because at first I was thinking this doesn't even taste that hoppy and then towards the end they just slapped me in the face. I taste the beautiful pine which I love in my drinks and damn is that pine great.  M: The carbonation is nicely evident. The body is difficult for me to identify because the hops come in strong right away. I would best say the body is above medium, but below thick. This even come in nice and creamy because of its great lasting head.  O: I feel as if the pine comes strong in my beers then I am sold. This does a great job at being great.This is a great brew for anyone to pick up and hopefully I will pick this up soon once again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Tastes like citrus hops with a touch of malt. Mouthfeel is medium with decent carbonation and no sign of the alcohol.  I bought this because it is less than a month old, I have had great bottles and horrible bottles of this beer, but I won't have any trouble finishing off this six pack.

345,14916,CrazyDavros,3.78,"Pours amber with a large, lasting head. Nose shows lots of tropical fruit with mango and lychee at the forefront. Underneath is caramel and lots of sweet clean malt. Later on some pine shows. Similarly fruity flavours at first before the hops transform to piny and spicy notes. Very piny! Lasts right through the lengthy finish, accompanying a bold bitterness. The resinous pine is a bit full-on in my opinion, almost seeming industrial. Quite a lot of sweet clean malt shows later. Carbonation could be a little higher, body seems a little thick.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Some piney hops, little else  T - Sour candy flavor, a slight burnt, with a bit of a crisp finish.  M - A creamy slightly malty feel  Tough to find the 8% ABV here. Dangerously drinkable for a DIPA.

I could smell the hoppiness from a few feet away. One of our friends could smell the hops from five feet away.  It smelled strong, but good in its strength. You get lots of citrus in the nose. I was concerned that this would be too strong (and too bitter).  It tasted great. The hops were present, but they were very well balanced.  I recommend picking this up.

Looks like a textbook DIPA.  S - Citrus and piney hops, some rye malt, a hint of some fresh fruits and honey.  T - I would describe this beer as a malty hop-bomb: there are a ton of hops at first but a nice malty backbone follows almost immediately to even out the bitterness.  M - Perfect amount of carbonation. The tastes linger for a while.  O - While this is more malty than many of the DIPA's I have tried, it is not the malt-bomb that (for example) Bittersweet Lennys is. Very good balance; I would say the hop/malt ratio is 70/30. A very good and original DIPA by Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,biboergosum,4,"12oz bottle, procured during a trip last month to, um, interesting, metro Detroit.  This beer pours a slightly hazy, medium golden yellow hue, with one finger of tight foamy off-white head, which leaves a nice array of various forms of webbed lace around the glass in its wake. It smells of bitter citrus, milder pine, soft caramel, and more prominent crackery malt. The taste is bready, crackery malt, bitter citrus peel, a bit of pine resin, and emerging sweet booze. The carbonation is on the low side, the body a wavering medium weight, a tad prickly, but smooth enough. It finishes off-dry, with a decently strong uptick in generic leafy, piney bitterness.  An agreeable DIPA, one which borders on the IPA fringe, in terms of flavour - no big malt/hop showdown here, just a nice hop-forward brew, the extra booze warming well subdued, that is until the temperature effect takes hold.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

T - Bitter hops, spice, lemon zest, malty finish.  M - Full bodied, smooth, creamy, medium carbonation.  O - The most balanced beer I have ever had, but it does not taste like a imperial IPA at all, more like an imperial witbier or something else.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

A nice yellowisg orange color with a decent amount of carbonation coming up through the center of the glass.  Smell: grapefruit, orange, and other citrus aromas come to scent. There are also some hints of pine and a slight malt aroma.  Taste: same as above, but the citrus and piney hops dominate this beer. Where is the malt to fight off the bitterness?  Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium to full bodied, a little chewy, some biscuit, and delicious.  Overall: I have had this beer on draft, singles, and bombers.

T - Intense!!! A big blast of hop bitterness from beginning to end. Has a very piney hop flavor with a sweet caramelly malt flavor.  M - Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation.  O - Now I know why they call this hop wallop. This is a very deceiving beer. The smell is much like a pilsner with the very clean malt aroma & the spicy hop notes. Then you taste it and pow you get a big wallop of hops.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,IPA4LIFE,4.22,"A- A little lighter than I expected, a pale shade of copper with a two finger off-white head with impressive retention.  S- Big, bold aroma. There is a sweet malty characteristic, but the most powerful aroma is clearly the hops. There is a bold citrus hit with some pine. Really typical Imperial IPA smell, with most of the aroma being contributed by the hops.  T- Really good. Really sweet and citrusy with a strong bitter bite that picks up on the mid-palate and continues into a bitter aftertaste. The hops are powerful and the beer does seem to lack complexity, but it is still good. Seriously well-hopped beer that numbs my tongue with bitterness. Pretty awesome.  M- Nice and full-bodied.  O- Really good. A typical Imperial IPA- which happens to be my favorite type of beer, so I can't complain. Not the best IPA I have ever had, but it is up there high on the list and it is a good example of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,bnes09,4.42,"Hazy, tangerine colored ale. Thin head appears smooth and creamy. Sticks to the glass after each sip.  Fresh and lively, floral, pine-sol, grapefruit and baby powder aroma. Bread in there also.  Hops dominate the flavor overall. Piney, grapefruit, soapy and herbal bitterness blend together to form a hop bomb on my tongue and reek havoc. Malt character is pretty solid though with a smooth and mellow rye bread-like character to keep the hops in check. Exceptional balance in this one.  Medium to fuller bodied. Borders on a creamy texture. Finishes dry from the lingering hops. Good carbonation.  I really like this for all the reasons stated above.

Maybe just more than an inch of head when I got it. Light, but good-looking lacing. Film was spread out throughout.  Pretty weak smell, especially for a double IPA. Pretty plain, but eventually got lemon zest.  Grapefruit hops up front on the initial taste. Also some sweet floral hops and maybe some caramel.  Medium to light body, Average carbonation. Smooth finish. Consistent taste throughout.  Wasn’t so high on this early, but the taste and feel really made up for it. Clean, crisp and refreshing, and a good taste overall.

345,14916,JohnnyChicago,2.99,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  A: Pours a beautiful pale blonde with a snow white head. Aho would have thought? A India PALE ale that's actually pale.  S: Smells pretty weak hop-wise. There's a lot of sweetness and thin hints of hop, but there is very little hop aroma.  T: Nothing here either...I would not have guessed this was a DIPA if I hadn't been told. Its plenty of light caramel malt sweetness, but where are the hops??? Only in the aftertaste do I taste that grapefruit flavour I wanted...but even then its thin and metallic.  D: Not something I'd buy again, this is just a below average DIPA that's way too sweet. Without sufficient bittering, the booze is to strong to call this ""drinkable"".  Overall: Man, this tasted like a good DIPA that had been sitting for 3 years. I checked the date though, and its relatively fresh. Weak sauce! This is a depressingly subpar DIPA from a kick-ass brewery. C'mon Victory, what's up with that? I feel like HopDevil has more IBUs than this.

Chill haze keeps me from seeing the clarity...the soapy white head settles in a ring and leaves lacing as well as alcohol legs on the glass.  S: Fruit and flowers, sugary, bitter & hoppy with a biscuity malt character thats dry and bready. Pineapple, pine, a touch of citrus rind, and just a hint of booze. Pretty malty and sweet.  T: Good upfront bitterness as the hops go to work...I get sugary dried pineapple, mango, papaya, pine cones, hop leaves, flowers, and lots of sweet caramel, candi sugar and grain...even some spices and herbs.  MF: Pretty light feel for an 8.5%...good carbonation and dryness.

345,14916,TheBrewo,4.12,"We pour a brew the color of darkened raw honey. The head is minimal, and sits an off-white color, receding into spots of foam across the glass. Lacing is light and sticky but, again, is minimal. Carbonation appears average, and there is a thick murkiness about the glass, despite an absent of visible sediment. The aroma is very fresh. It sings loudly with fruit and hops, and more specifically of peach and nectarine. The smell is “golden”, with light metals and huge, fresh soapy hops. Within the hop dominance there are citric and floral inclusions. Malts are sweeter, but not quite dark or caramel. As we sip, the taste kicks off with sweet and malty introduction. There is apricot and honey sweetness. Hops also begin early, with sweeter citrus, and a quickly bittering hop transition into the middle. Here the hops are bitter, herbal, and earthy. They own the middle, with the end showing a revival of smooth malts that hold a light toast. Here, too, there is a tiny bit of booze and a vegetable metallic flavoring. Monstrous soapy hops swoop in for a clean and balanced finish. The aftertaste breathes of more huge hops and soap. There is also a fruitiness of strawberry and apples, with a hollow booziness. The body is medium and the carbonation is medium. At the start the feel seems thin, but with warmth there brings an improved syrupy quality to the table. There is decent slurp and froth, and a drying from such bittering hops. The mouth is ultimately left cooled and coated. The abv is appropriate and the beer drinks with ease.  Overall, what we found to be best about this brew was how the bittering hops take center stage. This aspect is so unique with the huge bitterness, yet huge soapiness, which we found to be pretty ballsy. While this component was so present it blended well with the rest of the flavors. In the end, this is a wonderfully balanced DIPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,dball,4.11,As I write this I'm thinking about how many IPAs there are and how many are great and how many are really good. There are minor subleties that distinguish the great IPAs and I think this beer deserves that designation. It is a pretty straight forward imperial IPA with a true wallop of hops. It is not too fruity and looks beautiful poured into a pint glass. One particularly distinguishing character of this brew is the appearance. It has a deep and bright golden color that looks as tastey as it is. It has a solid two finger head and laces all the way down to the end. The only shortcoming on this brew is the smell. I found it not to be as bountiful in the nose as I expected. Give it a shot but watch out for the price tag.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Solid bead of fine bubbles.  Initial strong aromas of burnt plastic. Some pineapple, citrus and herbal hops are in the throng somewhere, but no matter how much I agitate the glass, plastic reigns.  Taste is somewhat better, showing impressive pine branch and Fisherman's Friend bitterness, tempered by tangerine and boiled candy sweetness. The chemical plastic character is still around, but much reduced.  Decently full with relatively high carbonation and an enduring bitterness.  Can't look past the plastic unfortunately. Either I'm in a small minority that is hyper-sensitive to a certain chemical compound that most others don't notice, or this is a dodgy bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Aromas are predominantly of freshly peeled orange and floral notes, along with a honey comb sweetness. The flavor intensity is off the charts. You will either love this beer or hate it.

The aroma is a little underwhelming but what I can get smells of orange rind and oily pine mixed. The flavor steps up the game - a symphony of bitter and citrusy sweet hops - oranges, nectarines, and grapefruit battle it out with an oily resinous army of hops. The malt bill doesn't really show through, pretty much a hop bomb. The mouthfeel is nice - the perfect amount of prickly carbonation explodes with flavor on the tongue - leaves my mouth sticky and wanting more. *Note - perhaps a slight numbing alcohol burn towards the back of the mouth.

Nicely fragrant hoppy aroma with a good blend of citrus, pine, and spice.  Taste is big time hop bitterness; faint citrus notes, not a ton of subtler flavors; vaguely oniony...is that simcoe?  Long, lingering bitter finish. Decent carbonation and creaminess in the mouth; pleasingly full.  This is a good DIPA but I personally prefer something where the more flavorsome hop tastes can emerge; the citrusy/piney/herbal notes here are pretty much overwhelmed. Definite hop bomb.

Getting lots of sweet pineapple, orange, apricot. Citric and floral hops are present. Just very aromatic and pleasant.  T - Straight up bitter to start. Still getting the sweet tropical fruits. Mainly oranges. Finish is bitter and lingering. Not a complex taste by any means but damn tasty. Simple and satisfying.  M - Smooth. Medium bodied, fine carbonation.

345,14916,BuxMontBeerLover,3.88,"I've seen this on the shelves many times before but with so many choices, I've never given it a try. Finally picked up a 6pk at Wegmans in Warrington.  Price: $11.99  Enjoyed in a DFH Pint Glass  A - Pours a very light golden color, slightly hazy. A massive 2-3, dense foamy head on the initial pour that lasts several minutes. Moderate lacing left after drinking.  S - Of all the items about this beer that I liked, it was the aroma that was the most disappointing. I really got nothing special on the initial whiff. Maybe a faint hoppiness but not at all what I'd expect from an IPA, let alone a DIPA.  T - The lack of hoppiness in the aroma is made up after the first mouthful. Huge hoppiness that is backed up with a pretty heavy dose of malts. Not as piney or citrusy as some DIPA's but a more drinkable type style of a DIPA. The alcohol is not initially too noticeable but as the beer warms up, the alcohol does come through.  M - A thinner consistancy, especially for a DIPA. A tangy bitterness lingers after each sip.  O - This was a good DIPA but not my favorite. It is just missing the huge citrus-pineyness that I enjoy so much. It's not a bad beer but better examples are available, IMO.  Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Smells super hoppy, that sort of oily aroma that you get with most double IPAs, and citrus as well.  Taste magnifies the smell, very strong hops though not too bitter. Very smooth, going well with the thick mouthfeel. A pleasant citrusy tang remains in the mouth after the swallow.

Wonderful and very clean!  T - Surprisingly spicy, with a good malt that lingers behind the rest. There is a very prominent bitterness that teeters between lemony citrus and piney resin. The finish is crisp and dry with a sweet caramel and toffee flavor. An almost fruity quality, like apples or pears, is also present, complemented by the clean hop character.  M - Great carbonation, clearly high in alcohol but not too sticky, and a really great dry mouthfeel from start to finish.  O - A really crisp and clean ale for such a high ABV.

Pine more so than citrus.  Taste - very hoppy. piney...I think I have it too cold and need to let it warm some.  Mouthfeel - very full bodied  Overall - Definitely improves if you let it warm up some. A tad too hoppy for me but not bad either.  New review 2019:  Appearance looks like a pilsner, not any IPA. Minimal head. Aroma is very muted. Not quite sure what I'm picking up. Kinda smells a little like Prima Pils (Pilsner again?) Taste is where there is a big jump/change since 2011. A nice sweet/malty flavor up front with light/moderate bitterness coming in at the end, and then the only strike against it is the aspirin like lingering of the bitter. Feel is nice full bodied and solid. Overall, I think I like this a better than I did back in 2011.

S-Sweet malt and slightly piney hops. Being from the west coast I prefer a little bit more in the nose. This is just average for me.  T-The bitterness is pungent, which I like. Malt recedes just enough to let the hops shone through. This is actually well balanced despite the lack of nose I initially got.  M-Almost perfect for the style. I can't stand when an IPA (albeit dipa) is syrupy. The carbonation is perfect enough to keep the hop bitterness light on the palate.  O-I like this beer a lot. I'm spoiled with Russian River and Alpine within my distribution area. This beer does a good job of showcasing what a double IPA can be. The one thing that's lacking for me though is a more forward nose. Dryhopping can do wonders for a beer like this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

T: straightforward, heavy-duty hops, citrus, w/ lingering bitterness & medium-dry finish.  M: Rich, medium body, moderate carbonation, w/ alcohol warming after. Feels like it could be sweet, but sufficient bitterness eliminates that possibility.  O: Hoppy and bitter, but still in control for a big ale. The expectations these names suggest -- Hop Wallop, Hop Stoopid, Hop Crisis -- make a good case for blind tastings. Fairly simple and easy to drink, it kept me looking for what I may have overlooked.

345,14916,Rifugium,4,"First had: on tap at Gullifty's, Wayne, PA  Another great choice. I'm beginning to think that Victory might be one of the most consistently good quality breweries around.  A golden yellow beer with a nice white head that typically displays good retention and lacing. Fresh hops in the nose, citrusy, and piney--a quality that distinguishes it from the Hop Devil--with a sweet biscuity malt base. Aroma follows through into the taste, with a sweet malt base generously overlaid with piney hops; lemony, with an alcohol drying finish.

A translucent yellow with not a whole lot going on in the body, but a gorgeous, inch-high, fluffy, white head develops and stays for a considerable amount of time. Smells of an odd black pepper scent at first, but is overtaken quickly by pine, straw, and faint citrus. Tastes of piney hops, sticky grapefruit and orange esters, and a faint caramel malt backbone. Not much else, and a rather watery mouthfeel that goes down nice and smooth.

Lively ale though, easily revived with one swirl. Clean, golden amber color, medium depth.  The smell is a very flowery, distinctly citrus, hop aroma, followed by golden malt and ale yeast. Very refined, classy.  Delicious, crisp, very hop dominated taste, fruity/citrusy hops with a distinct and very pleasurable bitterness, fairly dry, very nice malt, full bodied with great carbonation, wonderfully balanced, fresh, and just flat out delicious. Very fresh tasting, everything lasts the entire pour. The 8.5% ABV is completely hidden by the aggressive hops and the malt  Very long, bitter, hop dominated finish, hop oils coat the mouth and it seems to last forever  This is exceptionally enjoyable ale, perfectly balanced, and a pleasure to drink. Very hop dominated but with just the right amount of sweetness and malt to bring it all together. Seems to really open up at around 55 degrees, yeah to warm you say, but IMO. I originally thought this was overpriced all things considered, but I am starting to think it really is worth it.

M: The hops make their presence known, yet the beer is very smooth. It's medium bodied, has moderate carbonation, and little alcohol presence(for 8.5, probably masked by the hops).

345,14916,wnh,4.48,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Consumed 12.21.2010. (Enjoy by Feb 25, 2011)  Pours a remarkably pale golden straw with a large, long-lasting creamy and frothy white head. I like when an IPA, and even more a double IPA, is this pale, as it tends to indicate a big barely balanced hop presence. Fantastic lacing up and down the glass.  And the nose verifies the hoppiness. Big and brash, pungent, resinous, zesty, pithy, a bit catty. Lightly honeyed, with a toasted bready malt base.  The same on the palate, with perhaps a bit more emphasis on the pungent catty quality. Sweet orange zest up front, bitter and bracing mid-palate, finishing with a tacky and drying pine resin note. There's a kiss of sweet (orange blossom?) honey right before it turns resinous. Complexly hoppy.  Quite light in body but plenty firm. Fruity and faintly sweet but dry. Delicious. Certainly a hop-forward DIPA, barely kept in check by the malt. Though the maltier, more balanced versions have their place, it's nice to indulge my inner hop-head from time to time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,kaseydad,3.93,"Gladly picked this up at my local Whole Foods. Been wanting to consume for some time.  Duvel glass pour and I am met with an apricot colored ale with sticky lacing all over the glass. Starts with a large foam but quickly turns into a light film across the top. The aroma reminds me of a Barleywine. Sweet malt, candy, honey and slight orange. The taste is very subdued at first and all of the flavor comes through at the swallow. Rather sweet for my liking. Very interesting though as a big malty backbone is present and the grapefruit, pine taste stays right at the sides of my tongue. Sweet and bitter in each sip with a slight bite at the end. Long bitter finish. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. 8.5%? Couldn't tell. Overall I was somewhat disappointed in this brew. I was expecting a blast of hops but it was not to be found. It's got the light grapefruit but not what I'd expect from a beer called ""Hop Wallop"". Happy to have shared a session with it, but I feel there are better brews of this style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Pintofbrown,3.33,"Appearance: The beer is a bright lemon meringue color. It is cloudy like a Belgian bottle conditioned offering with an egg white, two finger head. There are plenty of bubble towers in the glass. This looks very nice.  Smell: This smell is wild! Ol’ Wallop goes beyond the normal citrusy hop nose. That is all the nose is. Hops, and then more hops, and then more hops. They are of the floral and citrus variety.  Maybe a little bit grassy, also getting a musty smell that reminds one of apples. The wheat flavor I am picking up may be from the malts.  Taste: The bitterness of the hops really shoots around in the mouth and pervades through the entire drink. There is a little bit of a lager-ish wheat taste in the finish. That is really about it though. It certainly is a Hop Wallop, and maybe I should not have expected more.  No interesting citrus profiles, not really picking up pine or mint. It is just the grassy, bitter hops and some wheat malt. The flavors are just amped. Call me crazy, but I like IPA’s that have a little complexity to them.  While this is certainly something I usually like, big and bold flavors, it is not interesting enough to make me care. And really, I’d be fine without that lager finish too.  Mouth feel: Obviously, the finish is very dry, and the carbonation is really easy to spot on the tongue. I do like that for such a bitter IPA, it is not hard to drink, more medium bodied. The beer is finishable, easily, but it is just not what I like about IPA’s.  Overall: They wanted a strong hop profile that pervades the beer and they certainly got it. I do not know why they needed that wheaty finish, but it is not my thing. I am sure that many IPA drinkers will like this beer, but it really did not fit my tastes.  I love IPA’s, but more so, I love the IPA’s that offer something more than just stuffing my mouth with hops. Some citrus, some pine, something interesting to mull over.

345,14916,MONKandTUCK,2.96,"A- Lovely beer, strikingly semblance to a Helles Bock, though more effervescent: there's lots of lacing and a frothy cloud tops Victory's proprietary .3 ml glass. I like a little more caramel color in my IPA's, but there's nothing wrong with erring on the pale side.  A- Derelict apartment & pineapple juice predominate. With some dryed-out Christmas wreath aroma coming the closest to fresh pine. It's far from the inviting floral, citrus and pine scents that come to mind with cravings of IPA's. It's a bit offensive, actually. God almight, Simcoe is a curse on man.  T- More of the piss-stained carpet smell. Then lots of harsh bitterness. The bitterness ought to be smoother, but it's about my only friend while I try to contend w/ the cat piss aroma/flavor. There's a hint of sweetness in the malt; otherwise it's pretty mundane. Thankfully the malt backbone carries out its part, otherwise this one would be a disaster.  The after taste is of canned pineapple juice with a hint of Pinesol. It's not a harsh finish, but the beer as a whole is an enamel stripper. Alcohol is unrecognizable, but leaves warmth in the gut.  I had a past-prime example of this beer in bottle a few months ago and loved everything about the beer, except that the hops had faded. I felt cheated of what might have been the best beer I would ever have... after having my tongue raped by Simcoe, I'm glad to have had an old bottle!  M- The beer's oily as a can of shoe polish. The prickly bitterness kinda balances that. The 8.5% ABV is beautifully hidden, and the finish dry. At this point the beer is on par w/ the rest of the Victory line-up.  O- This beer reminds me of while I'll never own a cat. Beyond that, it's something I'll prefer to forget. I'm a hop-head... even when I try not to be. Unfortunately, even I found this beer unenjoyable. It was out of whack: the bitterness reached excessive harshness, and the Simcoe up front was all chemical and putrid.  I know there are folks out there who're in love w/ Simcoe, but it's known to be a polarizing hop. It doesn't make sense to elect that as the hallmark flavor of their Double IPA.  I'm a big fan of IPA's. Even more, I want to see East Coast breweries emerge as respected rivals to West Coast exemplars. This Double IPA was up to a tall task, but failed because, I believe, the effort was there without the planning.

Flavor follows suit and on the tale end of the beer I get this fascinating minty flavor from the hops. It's almost like a wintergreen life saver but it is not too strong or over the top.

A: Yellow orange colour and a 4 mm head that fades to good lacing. 4  S: Piney hops and maybe some oxidation. 3  T: Piney hops into delicious floral aftertaste with some hints of citrus. Not particularly dry or sweet. Yum. 4  M: Light body but highly carbonated. 4  O: Very nice. 4,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

S - A sweet candy smell mixed with a citrus and piney hops  T - Hops dominate with a citrus hop flavor, slightly tart and a background of sweet malts.  M - Slick with a moderate carbonation  I like this beer. It hides the alcohol well. Nice hop flavor with some sweetness present as well.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,FreshHawk,4.25,"A - Slightly hazed apricot color with an average to larger than average sized, creamy, thick, sticky, white head. Very nice retention leaving thin lace.  S - Pine and floral hops are strongest. Fairly bitter aroma with hints of citrus. Lemon starts coming out a bit stronger as it warms along with some pineapple. Malt aroma is weak.  T - Bitter citrus and slight fruity hop flavors to start with. A strong bitter flavor to start. Mid sip there comes a bit more of a subtle sweetness with a touch of tropical fruit, mostly pineapple. Some floral aspects come out toward the end. Strong bitter and resinous flavors on the finish.  M - Medium body with average carbonation. Good mouthfeel but nothing special. Fairly refreshing finish.  D - Overall this is a good but not great DIPA. A little too bitter and resinous but it isn't too imbalanced.  Notes: Best by April 11 2012. Pretty good DIPA. Pretty bitter and resinous with just enough balance to make it drinkable. Very hoppy beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

As the beer warms, however, malt seems to fade while alcohol becomes more noticeable on the finish.  M - On the full-side of medium-bodied.  O - I think the appeal here is certainly for hopheads.

345,14916,DeltaGolfSierra,4.69,"Color is golden orange with a big firm head that lasts about halfway through, fading to a bubbly circle. Not much lacing on the glass. The cartoon hillbilly on the label holds me back a bit on the appearance score.  The scent is absolutely sublime - strong grapefruit and pineapple scents raise expectations for an amazing taste. And those expectations are fully met with a huge hops explosion. Citrusy sweet and tangy grapefruit tickles the tongue as it crosses the palate. There's just a touch of pine to keep you from thinking you're drinking grapefruit juice. The bitterness is prominent, but not overwhelming - just perfect. It's not a sudden punch of bitterness, but rather gradually builds to a wonderful crescendo in the finish. Perfect carbonation gives wonderful mouthfeel. There's a slight alcohol warming as it goes down. Wow, what a great beer!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Tons of fresh citrusy hops complemented by lots of piney hops. And so bitter don't be surprised if you pucker! Not much of a malt flavor here at all, but wow does that dry hop bite linger.

Light citrus, some orange and pineapple with some caramel malt.  M: Medium bodied with relatively high carbonation. Rather dry and sticky finish.

A hint of alcohol and some sweet sugary malts.  T - Quite similar to the aroma. Begins pretty balanced with a huge hoppiness and a good sweetness from the malt.

Body is a clear golden color, more yellow than orange. 2 fingers of white head with nice retention and sticky lacing. Lots of citrus and pine in the nose, maybe some sweeter malts as well. Fairly well balanced flavor, big on the grapefruit bitterness but enough of the malt comes through to keep it from being overly dry. Medium in body and carbonation, pretty standard. A nice, readily available selection from Victory.

345,14916,Jwale73,3.85,"12oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in my DT tulip. Enjoy by Dec 16 2011 printed on the label. Pours a translucent, pale, orange-gold with a frothy, one inch, bright white head. Head eventually settles into a quarter inch creamy cap - swaths and slashes of porous lacing are exposed during the tasting. Nose expresses some herbal bitterness initially, but there's a trace of candied citrus fruit and rind that follows. Taste follows nose - earthy bitterness comes out at the forefront, but the sweetness suggested by the nose nicely co-mingles, preventing the brew from being overly bitter. There's also a hint of tangerine in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation and a semi-dry finish; however, the overall mouthfeel feels a bit thin for the style. All and all a decent brew, but a bit subdued for a DIPA - closer to an extra IPA than a double in my opinion. That said, it's still a respectable beer from a solid brewery.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,RickS95,3.58,"Not really a looker. I expected something a bit darker, instead this was a very pale straw color and resembled a nasty American pilsner.  Citrus and flowers dominate in the nose.  Taste is similar to smell as citrus and pine are prevalent.  The mouthfeel is very smooth for the type and very easy to drink, a little too much so. For an IPA, especially an Imperial, it lacks the punch in the gut from the hops.  Better than I expected. High ABV and good lacing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Yagman3000,3.94,Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Appears very lightly orange - basically see-through. With a thin foamy heed remaining.  Smells of citrusy hops. No real maltiness cones through.  Tastes of orange and tangerine. Sweet and tea-like. A tiny bit bready on the way out.  Mouthfeel is pleasant and starts off pretty full... I'm nit quite sure it's a full wallop though! :)  Pretty nice and a decent value. Always wanted to try this but somehow never got around to it.

Usual hop aromsa, more of an orange presence at first blush.

Also, there's some mint thrown in there as well.  MF- Medim bodied with the right amount of carbonation.  O- I've had this many times before and this sample just doesn't seem to fit in with the others. It's usually much more of a hop foward beer than the sweetness shown in this one.

345,14916,IrishEyes32250,4.65,"I've pretty much NEVER been disappointed by a Victory brew and Hop Wallop is no exception. This is a fantastic beer from a fantastic brewery and if you are a hop head, one you need to try NOW. On to the review.  Presentation  12 oz. brown bottle. Per the story on the label: ""Horace 'Hop' Wallop headed West a broken man. For in the City of Blues a Miss LuLu Belle Lager had left him thirsting for more. Drawn by wild tales of riches to be had in the gold mines, Hop pressed on westward. His last nickel spent on a prospecting pan. Hop's hunger got the best of him. Two fistfuls of barley and three of some wild and wayward hops tossed in a pan with some clear water was to be his meal. But sleep overcame him and he later awoke to a bubbling, cacophonous concoction. Overjoyed with the beautiful ale that he had made, Hop realized the secret of the green gold he had discovered in those fresh hops. Celebrated far and wide, Hop Wallop lives on in this vivid ale with his words, ""hoppiness is happiness"". Enjoy!"" A beer with a backstory. Innovation in the craft beer world. That's more back story than most characters in today's Hollywood movies have. This isn't just a beer brewed and put on shelves for the enjoyment of craft beer lovers all over the USA. No, this is a beer with a story, which makes you appreciate and love it that much more. And when it's gone you genuinely grieve, because given the backstory of the mascot Horace ""Hop"" Wallace and the epic story behind the creation of this beer (his jilting via Miss LuLu Bell Lager leading to his adventure West and nearly starving to death) makes you relate to it. It brings a tear to the eye.  I am drinking this from my tulip.  A side note is that Bill Covaleski, co-founder and head brewer, does all the artwork for the beer labels himself. This is awesome. Not only does he brew it, but he's doing the art for the labels, too. Phenomenal. This dude knows what's up.  Appearance  Awesome white head on this. The beer itself is marginally (by marginally I man really) clear colored and it leaves a nice sticky lacing down the glass. It's like the bubbles are little mini Spidermen leaving webbing down the side of the glass as they are chasing Dr. Hoptopus in his attempt to steal the gold that gives this beer it's gorgeous hue.  Smell  Loads of citrus and loads of pine. Orange, grapefruit, and pine. All day. It's like you spent the night in a citrus grove and instead of coffee when you woke up you took some pine cones and fruit from the trees and had this for breakfast. Super aromatic beer.  Taste and Mouth Feel  Medium bodied with a nice crisp mouth feel. Taste is identical to the smell: Citrus including orange peel, a bit of lemon, grapefruit and tons of pine. It's a tongue twister. Citrus pine cone punch to the face. Say that 5 times fast. And do it while drinking this beer. It's like trying to conjure Jesus at a seance. Not gonna happen. There is a nice malt backbone there right up front to keep the hops in check, but the hops are definitely doing work throughout the rest of the experience. Easy drinking at 8.5% ABV. Fantastic balance in this beer. Dangerous  Drinkability  As hell. If you are a hop head, this is a phenomenal beer that is a fantastic example of the DIPA style. A fine example for all DIPA's to follow. Like a Valedictorian for it's school in the DIPA class. And this is an East Coast IPA. The West Coast is known for their IPA's but Victory is putting them on notice. If you haven't had this beer yet and you consider yourself a hop head, go ahead and cry yourself to sleep every night until you get the chance to try because YOU ARE missing out.  Overall  Overall, this beer is the $h!t. Everything about this beer is awesome, from the appearance to the balance in the taste. The name itself accurately identifies what this beer is about. You will get a wallop of awesomeness right in the face. Hope you have a cast iron jaw!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ehammond1,3.08,"Bottle (2011)  Texas Liquor Carlsbad, CA  A clear, almost straw yellow. Not a huge head nor a lot of lacing. Far lighter in color than most any other DIPA I've ever tried.  A relatively faint, bready, malty, and somewhat sweet nose. Not a huge amount of hops. Disappointing.  Quite a bit of hop bitterness but little else. A little cracker malt and some sweetness, but the main component is just a simple, relatively uninteresting bitterness.  Not quite carbonated enough. Has a lot of room for improvement.  An all around, boring, incredibly average DIPA. Where I find most DIPAs go wrong is having too much malt character where the hops are overshadowed or too much biting and hot alcohol presence. This beer doesn't have either of those, it's just so boring. This beer seems to beg it's way in to being average. I've had this beer twice now, wanting to give it a second chance, (and this time I knew it was fresh), and it was incredibly disappointing both times. I won't buy this again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BigDRS,4.89,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Hop Wallop is a very clear light gold with an off-white head. There's very little carbonation visible and the head eventually falls into a film and leaves a bit of lace.  The smell on this beer is amazing. There's a ton of hops. Citrus and pine scents dominate the nose. There's just a touch of a tropical twang ... mango or something close to it.  One sip of this beer and I'm hooked. If you want a hop bomb, this is it, start to finish. The lingering aftertaste is one of the best I've experienced. There's a bit of hop taste that comes up after each sip accompanied by an intense bitterness. It's flat out awesome.  Mouthfeel on this beer is also great. There's a sticky/syrupy character to it that I really love in a DIPA. Carbonation is just right.  Victory hit this one out of the park. Not only is this an awesome beer, but it's available year round AND it's only $10 for a 6 pack. This is going to become a regular in my fridge.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Zaradog,4.05,"Visual: Two finger eggshell white head that lasts forever. Extremely thick lacing on the glass. I wish I could upload a picture of it because it is pretty impressive. Color is light gold.  Aroma: Very malty smell with just the slightest fragrance of citrus hops. I was getting ready to cry “false advertising” but…  Taste: Wowsers! I found the hops! The hop bitterness builds in the front and just washes over your entire mouth. There is no quit. It lingers and you get a jolt to the taste buds every time you breathe in for the next several minutes.  Mouth Feel: This beer takes over your mouth. The bitterness is combined with a tingle… not from carbonation though. I think it is chemical burns from the hops &lt;smiles ear to ear&gt;. Even several minutes after a sip, the center of my tongue feels like I just licked a 9-volt battery. Don’t get me wrong… there is no metallic taste or anything… just tongue damage… but in a good way!  Drink-ability: The bottle says this beer is 8.5% ABV, so if I was trying to stay sober while out on the town my first inclination would be to stay away from this one. However this beer will make you slow down considerably. Take a sip, and then put it down for a minute or two… your mouth will still feel like you just sipped it merely seconds ago. I guess this is the beer that keeps on giving. But at the same time, I can’t imagine drinking more than one of these.  Impressions: Lives up to the hype. They add a ton o hops to this guy during the boil because the bitterness just keeps coming. Reminds me of Spinal Tap, “Yeah, but this one goes to eleven”. If I was the brewer I would be tempted to do a little dry hopping as well though because the aroma on this beer is relatively weak.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Light golden in color, could not ask for more.  S - Sweet maltyness, citrusy hops (lemon, orange, sweet fruits). Some grassy notes  T - Pleasantly bitter, nice grassy/citrusy presence with a great malty sweet balance, alcohol is present but in no way overwhelming. Nice dry finish and great bitter aftertaste  M - Medium body, well carbonated, very drinkable for 8.5%, nice!  O - Excellently balanced, really drinkable. Visually perfect.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,MrKennedy,4.13,"12oz bottle obtained via trade with Knapp85. Am a fan of Hop Devil and was keen to see how the big brother (in essence) stacked up.  Old gold colour appearance with a white head of foam that settles to a level of a quarter of an inch and grips the glass as it empties.  Not a huge smelling DIPA, but still a bit there. Mostly floral, with some pint and light fruit.  Plenty of hop flavour and a solid dose of bitterness hit the mouth. The hop flavour isn't over the top, the bitterness surprises, especially late. Flavours are of pine and some malt to back it up.  You certainly wouldn't pick this to be 8.5% ABV. Well balanced, the late bitterness keeps things in check. Body is in line with the style. Nice coating of the mouth and the bitterness can linger.  A very drinkable DIPA. Not the most hoppy, not the most bitter, not the biggest there is, but one that is sessionable which some seem to forget. I'm liking what these guys do more and more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

T- after about a second the hops do wallop your tongue and the bitterness lingers in your mouth for a while after the sip.  M- it kind of coats your mouth and has a light amount of carbonation.

T: The taste is way better than the smell lets off. It's got a great kick of hops to begin, a good malty flavor, along with a lemony floral hop finish. Has quite a bitter taste at the finish but a good bitter.  M: Smooth, thin mouthfeel. Sits nicely on the tongue.  O: I would defintely get this beer again.

Not expecting this, but the nose is unassertive and simple. Some underlying grain, but nothin much.  T: spicy and tea like. So much more subtle than many U.S. IIPA's I've sampled. Huh. Some base layer alcohol, low bitterness, and warm hay like flavors.  M: medium body and moderate to lo carb. Thin film of slick on the finish.

The smell of the beer is hoppy but I have a feeling that the cask may have muted some of the aromas in this one. The taste of the beer is hoppy also had a nice tasting bitter finish to it. The mouthfeel of this beer was silky smooth from the cask. This beer didn't last me very long, it was in my belly shortly after it was given to me. Overall I am looking forward to trying this from a bottle to see how much it differs, I've got a 6 pack waiting to go in the fridge right now. All in all it's a good IIPA that teams well with the HopDevil.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,matttttYCE,3.08,"12 oz bottle with an enjoy by date of Nov 3, 2011 poured into my nice tulip glass. At 5 months out from the enjoy by date, I can't imagine this is THAT old.  Appearance - Slower side glass pour brings about a finger's worth of white head. Mix between creamy bubbles outside and slightly rockier ones on the inside. Head lasts a decent amount of time. Color is a bit of a cloudy lemon amber. Makes me think of lemon just looking at it, not quite sure why. If anything a lighter color than I expect for a DIPA.  Smell - The nose actually seems a little subdued to me especially for a DIPA. I'm picking up lemon/citrus, floral, and maybe some earthy hops along with sweetness. I feel like I'm getting also a little bit of a Saison-type smell or a Belgian yeast smell (Idk what type of yeast Saisons are brewed with). This does compliment the lemon citric character, but in my mind, just average for a DIPA aroma.  Taste - At first sip I get a mix of bready malt, citrus and floral hops, possibly some pine, but I may be confusing that for some of the bitterness. I feel like I'm getting hints of spice as well (like the Saison hints in the nose suggest). Hops are not as wallop-y as I expected from something named Hop Wallop and described as a ""very hoppy ale"". It's definitely a DIPA. Alcohol is not present at all, hidden very well, but shows its effects pretty quickly. Personally, I feel like the malt is too balancing and the mix of hops just don't do it for me. That said, it's not a bad beer, just not my preference for the style. In my mind really feel like this is just an average DIPA.  Mouthfeel - Mouth is nice and light, almost an airy smooth quality to it. Medium carbonation and a light-medium body. Finish is average, but good length and leaves the mouth pretty wet. Drinkable. Again just about an above average feel for a DIPA.  Overall - Overall, basically just an average DIPA for me. Can't sat this was a bad beer, but can't say I thought it was good either. Worth a try since it gets high grades from many other people. I just didn't really feel it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,birdman200,4.25,"Pours a pale orange color with a 2 finger head, leaving a thin layer behind. Smells of fresh grapefruit. Taste is started with a big hoppy bitterness, and very full bodied. Very crisp with a dry start, that leads to a sticky sweet flavor of hop resin in the mouth. Great DIPA, I'm still trying to get over the full, sweet mouthfeel that accompanies DIPAs, that regular IPAs don't. Very good beer though, right up there with DFH 90 min.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,titosupertramp,4.03,"A: Clear, light golden color. A little lighter than you'd expect for a DIPA, but there's nothing wrong with that. Big, rocky white head with lots of texture. It leaves behind a good bit of film on top of the beer with loads of caked on lacing.  S: It's very sweet. Floral, honey, citrus fruits, bready malt.  T: Follow the nose almost to a tee. Nice balance between the hops and malts...neither bitter or sweet really take control. Floral and lemony citrus, honey, sweet malts. Nice tasting beer. Alcohol doesn't make its presence known despite the relatively high ABV.  M: Creamy body with some tingling effect. Fairly dry finish.  O: Hop Wallop isn't the typical DIPA being produced at the moment. A previous reviewer mentioned this being barleywine like and I'd have to second that. I think this might actually be a pretty good beer with some age on it...I know of shop here in town with two year old Hop Wallop still on their shelves..maybe I'll give it a shot.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Smakawhat,4.18,"Poured into a nonic pint glass from the bottle.  Very large off white head off the pour that is quite soapy looking. An interesting body color of a deep gold, dark yellow that is quite clear. Barely seen rising carbonation coming from the bottom. Some good lacing sticking to the glass in obscure places.  Sugar citrus and honey on the nose, very sweet smelling, sort of honey blossom and floral. Doesn't seem large thought in hop profile. Pleasant none the less.  However, upon taste the beer deserves it's name. Within the mid palate big hop blast of various spices, clove, some hot peppers, some forest like pine, mild lime bitterness. Finish is a very tolerable bitter that builds after the swallow slowly, making for a great feel and brining fresh lime oil. Good simple body to the brew, without the syrupy honey sense on the nose and a good green. Refreshing and not intolerable.  Overall quite a good hoppy beer deserving of its name. Good mix of a hop blasting beer that isn't off putting but also easy drinking and enjoyable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Blanco,3.56,"this is a re-review after having it a few more times and with a fresh bottle. best before 5-3-12.  golden yellow color with a huge white head. sticky lacing throughout. very fruity, citrusy smell, almost like a tropical fruit livesaver with some faint hints of mop water though. typical of Victory brews. Very bitter flavor, grapefruit and citrus bite. almost no malt in the taste and far less than I expected for the style. It's unbalanced toward the hoppy side, but not necessarily in a bad way. there is a slight alcohol burn though. light to medium bodied, very little mouth coating. This is a solid brew. Not my favorite but at $11 a sixpack, it's not a bad choice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,shand,4.29,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a nonic.  Strange appearance to a DIPA, it's a very hazy golden color with a tiny head that doesn't retain for long. Looks more like apple juice than beer. Aroma is a nice amount of citrus and piney hops. The taste is very good. This is a great citrus and hop DIPA that has the classic IPA flavor profile, just doubled. Huge grapefruit, and a restrained but still large amount of hops.. Just a touch of alcohol. Delicious.  The mouthfeel is full and suitably coating, and the drinkability is quite good. Overall, a very good double IPA that makes a great standby.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,tigg924,3.98,"Poured into a pint glass  Appearance: 1/3 inch head, gold in color, hazy, moderate carbonation  Smell: citrus and pine hops with faint malt  Taste: a small bready caramel start followed by a big dose of piney hops that slowly mixes with floral hops  Mouthfeel: medium carbonation, medium-light body,sweet start with a sharp bitter body and bitterness that really lingers.  Overall: I like this beer a lot. That is not something I would have said three years ago when I first had it. This is a hop bomb for those who love hops and can handle the bitterness. While I wish the aftertaste was not so dry, I could see myself picking up a six.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,diddly,4.35,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint.  Aroma is strongly hopped, with not much else noticeable, and more on the floral side.  The beer is a little lighter than one would expect, probably a dark gold.  Hoppy taste, with floral hops, and a bit of the Northern type, piney, in the back. It's well-balanced overall, but as would be expected from a DIPA, the hops overwhelm all else. The hops leave a bitter taste, but this is obviously right for the style.  Mouthfeel is full, past medium, and with a bit of a tingle from the bitterness.  Overall a very nice IPA and something I would definitely like some more of. I'll be on the lookout for another 6-pack.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,machostacos,4.2,"Poured from bomber into my favorite tulip. Best by June 24, 2011, so this one is a tad bit old (I pulled it from the cooler at the store, so hopefully it's kept better than otherwise.)  A: Pours a very bright orangey-amber with a small white head that dissipates quickly, leaving a very thin, spotty film and small ring that hugs the glass. Beautiful color. Nice spotty lacing.  S: This smells more like a hop-forward barleywine to me (which is a good thing!) I'm sure the age has something to do with it, but I'm not complaining. Some hop character shines through - floral and resiny. The malts really shine through however - lots of great toasty caramel and sweet bready malts.  T: More hops here, though still subdued - nice light citrus, floral, slightly oily and dank, resinous hops. Good, sharp bitterness. Malts balance perfectly with a nice caramel and toffee sweetness. Very nice balance.  M: Medium-full. Decent carbonation. Oily - coats the mouth well. Very smooth and clean finish. Very nice.  O: This is a great DIPA, and another winner from Victory. This is nearing the end of its prime, so I'd definitely be interested in trying Hop Wallop fresh. The age seems to have given it a decidedly barleywine-like character, which is great, but I'll hopefully get my hands on this fresh and see how it compares. No complaints here!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,StoneTSR,3.66,"APPEARANCE: The Hop Wallop is a great looking beer. A big, thick and fluffy head rests on top and hangs around for a long time before finally receding. Skimpy lacing, but it is very pretty and arch-like.  SMELL: Orange and grapefruit dominate the aroma. It is not too strong a nose, nor too weak. As I take the first sniff of this beer I can imagine it going either way, sweet and malty with some citrus or it could end up being a complete hop bomb.  TASTE: The latter it is, the Hop Wallop certainly lives up to its name. Grapefruit and a bitter hoppiness dominate the sip throughout. The bitterness slowly eases up throughout the sip, but another Wallop of hops sneaks in just at the tail end.  MOUTHFEEL: This is a palate-scraping beer. Nice and bitter without a whole lot of balance. It has an oddly dry mouthcoating feel, which is fine at first, but becomes a little more difficult to deal with towards the end of the glass.  OVERALL: I enjoyed this beer with a nice, big plate of spicy cajun food. The bitterness is fantastic, but it could have used just a touch of some balancing malt.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,FanofHefe,4.47,"Bottle labeled dated best by Oct 14, 2011. The body is a very light yellow color. Kind of odd in my experience with DIPAs. Large, creamy, two-finger white head, that retains fairly well and leaves nice lacing.  Big hop presence in the aroma. Pine and citrus are dominant and prepare you for a nice bitter flavor. Grapefruit, light orange, and some minor bready malt in the background.  Great hop flavors are the signature of this brew. Grapefruit, pine, light grassy notes, a bit of orange citrus, and just a bit of malt sweetness on the back end, but not much. This is one DIPA that does not overdo the malt. Very hop forward.  Light to medium mouthfeel with an oily hop presence in the mix. A must have for all hop heads.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,futura123,3.83,"Poured from bottle to a tulip.  Appearance - Pale hazy orange in color and very hazy with some visible carbonation. The head came up and showed great retention.  Smell - The complex hops are led off by the huge pine resin and citrus. This aspect of the aroma is extremely strong.  Taste - Great level of carbonation. Yes, this one is the hop monster. The hop flavor bursted. This beer does not have good malt backbone balance to tone down hop like other DIPA. Alcohol is not noticeable at all  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied. The bitter flavor aftertaste lingered on the tongue  Drinkability - Quite drinkable. Not that easy to drink like PtE due to the lack of balance.  Overall: this will be a top on the list for all hopheads. However, if you are looking for great balance, this beer may not for you. Still a distance compared to PtE",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,fox227,3.92,"A: Golden colored with some head, but not much. One thing that stands out to me glaringly is that I'm not getting much retention.  S: Smacks of grapefruit and some sweetness from the malt.  T: Smacks of more grapefruit, some caramel and strong bitter hops. I can also taste a bit of alcohol heat as this is a very fresh bottle. I would have to say that a bit of harshness is present, but overall it's an enjoyable taste.  M: Carbonation is minimal; this seems to go flat rather quickly when poured from a bomber, which is a shame because this beer is definitely a sipper.  O: This is a good DIPA, but it reminds me a bit of a fresh Barley Wine, comparable to fresh Bigfoot. It's a really good beer and all, but I've had better, and will have better in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Smells floral, lavender, a touch of citrus, touch of sweet alcohol. As this warms a bit of tobacco and resinous hops comes through.. Tastes floral, piney, carmel, sweet crystal sugary malts, some resinous tobacco sticky tar notes in a good way. Quite complex and put together quite nice. I think I should have drank this one a bit sooner. The yakima glory I had about a month ago had a much bigger nose of floral hops. This one does not, but does not disappoint overall, but if this is indeed similar in the hop and grain bill with the exception to the dark malts, to the yakima glory, then I'd prefer this one over the yakima.

Kind of some sweetness through all the hops.  Bitter hops emerge after an initial hop spice. Some orange, grapefruit. Bitter, yet smooth hoppy finish. Kind of surprised a sweet orange flavor emerged in the middle as I drank.  Pretty smooth drinking. Light to medium body.  Overall like it says its a very hoppy ale. I like it, but like others more.

Nice lacing on the glass, as I drink I can see the resinous hop oils sliding slowly along the glass - a beautiful sight.  Smell: Very strong hop aromas, a distinct boozy alcohol element to the smell. I'm anticipating quite the walloping of my taste buds.  Taste: Beautiful. Tastes like pure hop ambrosia, a fitting tribute to the immense, seductive powers of the hop. A small malt backbone gives the beer a good base, I am happy to report that the malt is much more toned down than HopDevil. This one is a sipper, and an amazing one at that.  Mouthfeel: Likewise quite grand. The stickiness of the hop oils leaves the mouthfeel full and syrupy. A perfect amount of carbonation, more than appears in the glass.

S: Heavy grassy/floraly notes in the nose. The scent is also very citrusy.  T: The taste is an extremely good blend of herbs, citrus, and flowers. The main hop flavor I get off of this one is like freshly clipped grass. I love hops and this beer delivers the goods. The maltiness is a little overpowered by the hops, but I don't mind.  M: A little on the thin and watery side. Not bad though. The lighter body and mouthfeel make this beer seem extremely quaffable. The alcohol leaves the mouth dry.  O: A delicious beer. It is certainly no Hop Devil, but this is still one I drink often enough. I like the higher alcohol content in this beer and I enjoy the lighter color and hoppiness.

It's great to be in PA where Victory has great prices. Bought at Scooter's pub in Mt. Pleasant, PA. This beer warmed up on a 1.5 hour car ride. I'd say it's at least 55 degrees  Smells of pungent hops and a shitload of them. The proprietary yeast strain Victory uses hits the nose just beneath the hops. Hops are mostly piney and a hint citrusy.  The taste is a hop head's wet dream. First you taste that Victory yeast that's so esential to their flavor profile, but not for long. The hops are the main event. Citrus hop flavor hits the pallet first followed by piney hops (the opposite order in which you smell them). The first time I drank one of these I desribed it as hop flavored sparkling kool-aid.  The finish has piney hop character and a slightly milky mouthfeel that comes from the strong malty sweet background (which is masked by tons of hops in the middle).  This ale is 8.5abv so it will f you up quick. The hops mask the hell out of the booze. NO boozy taste here. This beer is DANGEROUS if you are a lover of hops like me. Don't get to chug happy!  I recently had one that spent 2 years in the bottle and the hops smooth out into a fruity, citrusy flavor and aroma. The beer is sweeter. More alcohol in the nose but less on the palate.

This beer has a wonderful earthy smell to it.  T--Heavy hops that 'wallop' the tongue (see what I did there?). Following the hops there is a rich citrus taste that followed the nose perfectly. It finishes with an excellent bitter aftertaste that is what I want from my DIPAs.  M--Light carbonation, medium body, surprisingly not detecting the syrupy quality that most of the DIPAs I have had recently exhibited.  O--This is probably my favorite DIPA I have ever tasted.

S- Tropical fruit and some pine, smelled good, but pretty faint aroma  T- Strong piney hops, some tropical fruit, this is a bitter beer that packs a punch, but does lack much of a malt backbone or sweetness I expect from many DIPAs.  M- Finishes day, tickles the tongue with very high carbonation.  O- An enjoyable beer, but does not stack up with a lot of the DIPAs I really enjoy.

Almost along the same vein as Ruination but it seems to have a better finish with sweet malts and grains leaving a wet not dry hit to my palate. Good stuff.  M - Seems to be more medium bodied. Hops are strong but not overbearing  Overall I had this before and had no idea it was a DIPA just a strong hop IPA. Even though I know the bottle I had was at least a month old the hop presence is strong. Almost has a soap like west coast quality that lingers on the palate.

It's lighter in color than most DIPAs, and pretty hazy. The smell is so freakin' good! ""Walloped"" with a citrus aroma! The taste doesn't disappoint either.

S: Very herbal smelling with some spicy smells that assault the nostrils. Another whiff to acclimate picks up some pine and grapefruit smells. It's a bit light and the head retention isn't quite there but the smell is spot on. T: Follows the nose pretty well. The flavor stars off pretty herbal and slowly slides to a piney and resinous flavor with just a small hint of what could very well be grapefruit rind. On the swallow there is a lingering piney aftertaste with just a kiss of sweetness to show that there were at least SOME malts used in this beer. On subsequent sips the malts do show themselves M: high carbonation is a tad prickly and the beer feels a bit thick but isn't chewy. It does border on syrupy though but it doesn't quite get there.

Alcohol is pretty detectable, but not in a bad way at all. It only adds to the hop character of the whole experience. Burst of hop flavor in the front, big bitterness in the finish (big perfect bitterness I must add). Taste is up there with the best double IPA's I've tasted.  Victory knows their way around hops. This isn't my favorite DIPA in the world but it's close to the top. I loved every sip.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Taste: Opposite of smell basically. Hops. And it is not a very balanced. Almost a cough syrup like taste, sadly. Not very good imo. Mouthfeel: Mild carbonation that leaves the mouth dry. Overall: Good on all fronts except the one that matters most. This is a very unbalanced beer that I probably will not buy for a while.

Moderate retention, good lacing. Very hazy, and very light in color for a DIPA from my experiences.  Smell: Interesting. Definitely fruity. It smells almost exactly like the 2005 Celebration I just reviewed, just brighter. Tropical fruit gum, canned pineapple and ripe pear. Plenty of citrus. A spicy tinge. Orange peel. Some piney hops are present as well. I saw someone mention straw in another review and I would say I get that here as well.  Taste: Very sweet up front an carries through all the way to he end where the hops finally make an appearance. Citrus and earthy hop bitterness stay on the palate. Fruity flavors, pear mango and grapefruit. I wish this was a little more fresh as it seems the hops are taking a back seat to the malt. As it warms the aftertaste becomes mildly astringent. Almost no sign of the alcohol, which is good.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is medium with a medium to high carbonation.  Drinkability: Medium  Not bad but definitely not my favorite DIPA. It's something different than what I've had before and I'm glad I was able to try it, but I doubt I will ever get it again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Not overly impressive, doesn't stick around too long, and doesn't really leave any lacing.  The aroma isn't very impressive, seems laid back. There are some malty/sweet notes, and a slight citrusy hop smell. Not overly impressed with the nose. The taste is better. There is are good bready malts, and even some caramel. There are some nice citrus flavors, maybe even a little pine. There are some nice spices as well, and the alcohol is hidden nicely.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied, nicely carbonated, and feels great on the tongue. Overall, this is a very good brew. I've had better, but this is something that I enjoyed.

A - Pours a nice deep yellow with little head, but lacing sicks around for a long time.  S - Hops, hops, and more hops. Mostly citrus and pine, little malt, and some alcohol.  T - Damn, the name is no joke! I've had a lot of DIPAs, but this one hits like a ton of bricks. First sip is so bitter it stings the sides of the tongue, followed by some leafy/herbal notes and citrus. Finishes dry but not overdone. Bitterness fades somewhat as it warms, and the malt comes out a little bit along with warming alcohol and more complex hop flavors, especially lemon/orange.  M - Body is medium but very well done. It coats the palate and really lets the hop bitterness dig deep into your soul.  O - Pretty drinkable given its ABV (drinks right about where it should.) I could sip about 2 of these in a night, but certainly not with anything else. Dominates the palate but doesn't destroy it.

345,14916,bobhits,4.08,"Pours a tall white/egg shell head with lacing unlike just about any beer I've ever had. I was starting to think I was insane in expecting insane amounts of lacing from double IPAs, but thankfully Victory has reminded me of what this style should look like.  Sharp citrus hops start and more or less finish the nose here. Lemon seems to stand out more in this than similar IPAs (vs a strong grapefruit that's carried by caramel malts).  Drying alcohol actually opens the flavors, followed by SHARP hops that bite the front of the tongue. The finish is somewhat flat though. They wanted to show case the hops and used a rather light malt flavor. I have a feeling this case I got is a bit old (my friend brought it back from pit a few months ago but we didn't meet to exchange till now). The hops in this one seem to hang around rather well after the beer is long gone. I can't place the malt flavors here. They certainly add something, but they're light and I just can't place it.  There is certainly a decent amount of alcohol in this one. It seems to mix with the hops and frankly it just works. Rather refreshing given the higher abv.  I wish this were a touch fresher, but it's still an excellent IPA and worth the hype. Just wish I were available locally.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Anyways,  Appearance- Black Hills Golden. A warming, inviting hue that procures the ideal idea of ""Beer"". Crystal clear clarity with a wonderful glow. Quickly vanishing head with average lacing.  Smell- Piney, citrus-like, and pungent. Tickles the nostrils with a bitter bite noticeable through the nose. One of the strongest scents I've ever encountered.  Taste- Maltiness tries to break through with no avail. Hops, Hops, Hops. Warning: Unless you like some heavy hops, stay away from this beer. One of those beers that is memorable just because of the kick in the teeth you get. Citrus and pine are incredibly strong. The malty backbone does just enough to mute them into some semblence of a great beer. Very earthy, very floral.  Mouthfeel- Possible perfection. Lingers through the sip just long enough to leave you with an wonderful memory of the taste as the beer quaffs your thirst. Heavy enough to carry its own weight, but light enough not to be filling.  Overall- This a a great beer. I'm thoroughly impressed with this beer. Victory did it right with this one; Thank God its a year-round beer.

345,14916,output01x,3.76,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A vigorous pour yields a weak 1-finger off-white head that quickly recedes to a light film struggling to cover the clear golden straw-colored body. A good amount of bubbles constantly rise toward the diminutive head. Lacing is also quite minimal.  Resiny pine, grassy floral, and slight citrus notes are all apparent in the nose. You can tell this is going to be nice and bitter just by smelling it.  Mandarin oranges and pine cascade over the tongue but fade quickly. Then nothing. No real flavor for a good 10 seconds until a nice bitterness creeps in out of nowhere.  Moderate carbonation and a medium body allow this beer to be felt as it is consumed. Easily drinkable as it is not thick or creamy, but the body definitely has some heft to it.  The bitterness is good and would surely please any hophead but I would have definitely preferred a stronger flavor profile in this beer. The aromas led to expectations that the flavors just didn't quite meet.

S: Whoa! Initially i got a strong lager smell off this beer. After a few minutes that resolved itself to an underdeveloped piney hop smell. Some light citrus in the background with cardboard and solvent.  T: Whoa this is a huge bitter monster. The hops jump right out and slap you in the fact with pure bitterness. I dont get much citrus or pine but pure bitterness with alcohol and solvent again. As the beer warmed it became more friendly but was still all bitterness. Spiciness and the slightest bit of saltine cracker hit me in the middle. It felt like it was going to fall apart in the middle but somehow saved itself and slid home with a smooth finish and warm alcohol burn.  M: A bit less than medium bodied and thinner than I would prefer but solid. Not much carbonation to speak of.  O: A hop bomb in the most bitter sense of the word. Not too layered or sophisticated just paint thinner. I think the name does this one justice. I feel slapped.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

The only other beer I have tried from Victory was Prima Pils, I liked it so I figured I would give this one a try. I was surprised to see this is a DIPA for some reason I figured it was an IPA. No visible bottling date. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a imperial pint glass.  A- The label is pretty cool, I like the cartoon of what looks to be an old miner. This beer poured a hazy golden orange color with two fingers worth of fluffy white head that died down to a thin layer that left some lacing.  S- At first I pick up lots of sweet bready malts along with some honey. There is a nice mix of pine and citrus hops. The aroma seems a little muted.  T- Starts with some sweet caramel malts that makes for a nice backbone for this beer and is not overly sweet. The yeast used in this brew imparts a slight bit of spices. The honey carries over from the aroma, The hops come off more piney then grapefruity and is a little more earthier then I expected. The finish is pretty bitter.  M- Medium bodied, crisp, and good carbonation.  Overall I thought this was a good DIPA. This one was pretty different then some of the other DIPA's I have been drinking lately as this one leaned more towards pine and earthyness when it comes to the hops. It was a little more bitter then I would like, but the sweet caramel malts helped keep it in check. I would buy this again and would recommend it to people who like this style.

Bitterness sticks to the tongue all the way to the finish. Slight alcohol warming, aftertaste of more pine.  D: Far too sweet for my liking. The fruit and honey flavors are not mixed well with the bitterness. Definitely a hoppy ale, to the point of unbalanced and careless.

More bitterness than I care for and I enjoy double IPA's. A very bitter beer.  M - Light and fluffy, well-carbonated. No film or coating, but bitterness does hangs around between sips.

There is a strong bitter slightly sour mouthfeel on the back end. It was medium bodied, but tilted towards the light side. There is a good amount of carbination even though it looks rather flat.

The sweet elements here are spectacular, lots of taffy with hints of sugary fruit and vanilla. Huge, fresh, resinous citrus overwhelms the sweetness at the end.

Piney and grapefruit hops right off the bat with a nice mellow caramel malt background  M: I think that the taste is great, but I think the mouthfeel is where this beer makes its money. Excellent carbonation, the beer fizzes when it first enters your mouth. Great drying hops that coat your entire mouth with a drying aftertaste. The caramel back ground adds just the perfect amount of syrupy goodness. The combination makes it hard to put this beer down.  O: This beer is excellent.

This ones sticking around like the winter of 2010/2011.  Best by date on bottle is unreadable, so it might be a little old. That being said, the nose is actually kind of weak. There is some citrus hop, some bready yeast, and caramel malts, but barely noticeable.  Tastes like maybe a Belgian yeast strain was used, of which I am not very fond. It seems like every beer with Belgian yeast tastes like a sweaty gym sock. There is definitely some hop bittering. Grapefruit rind?not zest. The 8.5 ABV is there late.  It is well carbonated, and full bodied. Dry finish, and bordering on sticky for a ""very hoppy ale.""  Like I said at the start of the smell, I don't think I have a very fresh bottle here.

Update: The trading partner, turfy, that originally sent me this was really upset at my score. He went way out of his way to find more Hop Wallop that he was sure was fresh, and send me another 6pack. The enjoy by date is Nov, 03, 2011. I think that was what the first bottles said. Anyway.. to surmise. I don't think my score can change from the original score. I will explain myself though. I do not like Belgian beers at all. Whenever I taste a Belgian yeast strain I do not like the beer. With this being said, take that taste and smell out of this beer, the score is dramatically higher. There is some good hop tastes that I like and I liked the alcohol warming of this one. But my score stands. Sorry turfy. I do want to commend your efforts though. Above and beyond!! P.s.

Having said that, I purchased a 6'er for $11 and don't regret it, but, would rather have a a 6'er of SN Torpedo for $8.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,pjcors,3.6,"Poured from a 1 pint, 6oz bottle.  A- Pours a dark yellow, almost amber. Very thick with about half a fingers worth of bone white head. The head quickly disappeared after the beer was poured. Carbonation and sediment was also present.  S- Very hoppy. Citrus and pine hops both come to the forefront. There is a slight hint of honey that appears as well. The smell was very pleasing. Relaxing almost. Very enjoyable.  T- This beer is very hoppy. It should be obvious by the name, but hops are one of the most prevalent tastes. A multitude of different hop flavors come to mind, the most noticeable is the citrus. It almost has a grapefruit quality. The hop overload was a little much for me. However, I did enjoy the nice tangy aftertaste.  M- This is a thick beer. The mouthfeel is very syrupy, which in this case I found to be very pleasing. The hoppiness and bitter flavors go well with the thickness of the beer. It all combines to make a beer that is pleasing to the senses.  D- A bit too thick and chewy to want to drink consistently. I did enjoy my bottle. A special occasion beer, not something I'd want to drink consistently.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

The hops in this one comes off citrus-sweet and flowery, and they are supported with a malty bite that comes up strong in the end and you really don't see it coming. My first couple of sips I just sat there completely perplexed not knowing what the hell I had just tasted. It was really great! The other surprise with this one is the ABV... it's 8.5% but the beer is easily drinkable, not thick like you might expect an imperial IPA to be.

Palate is crisp and very thin for for the style. Bitterness is all at the back of the palate, yellow grapefruit here too and bitter citrus peel. Some pale malt grain.

T: Started with a nice citrus taste but the middle and majority of the flavor reminded me of a light American pils, which is surprising with the german barley. Ended with a very good bitter, but lacking a good hops flavor.  M: Very light and carbonated.

What points I deduct for a mediocre head, I reimburse for the beautiful hue. Looks like a nice pilsner.  Smell: Dare I say award winning?! Fantastic smell of citrusy hops - very pungent.  Taste: This beer is awesome. Huge citrus flavor. I'm digging it. I like that I can't taste the alcohol in this 8.5% ABVer.  Mouthfeel: Somehow clean and smooth, yet still manages to coat my entire mouth. I can feel my tonsils pucker.  Drinkability: Based on the ABV, I'd say sessionability is limited, but this beer hides the alcohol very well. I'm on number two... and I'll probably stop here.  Overall: A great DIPA!

Some underlying soapy hints of bitterness but that's all. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Low carbonation. Creamy texture. Definitely not a west coast IPA. The hops are much more subdued than I like but they are still crisp and bright. The palate is grassy with pine, honeydew, and grapefruit flavors. The delicateness of the hops make this a more balanced effort. The finish isn't super resiny but it still packs a good amount of IBUs. Maybe I am just too used to the way we do it out west but I can't decide how much I like this one.

The first thing that got me when I opened it was the smell. It was good, the hops came through and slowly filled the room.  I poured it into a glass, the golden color was just what I would have expected, a bit cloudy and small bubbles streaming up from the bottom.  The taste was very good, usually I stay away from IPA's, just something that doesn't suit me, but this one was different, it was very drinkable, not bitter or overly powerful.

Hoppy, but not quite as flavorful as the aroma might have led me to expect.  Mouthfeel was also good. It's a very hoppy beer, so I could feel the residue on the roof of my mouth.

Some light caramel malt character.  Some fresh earth hops right off the bat balanced bitterness that transitions to some fruity hop characters. A specific hop profile seems to be popping out but I can't put my finger on it. Mellow finish but also bitter. Balances well and doesn't ""wallop"" you like it says.

Good carbonation. The minute I cracked the bottle I could smell the hops. Aroma is hop heavy, with hints of pine and citrus. With time the malts made their presence felt in the aroma. Taste is absolutely fantastic. True to it's name it packs a serious hop wallop. Upfront the taste is all hops, perfect amount of bitterness for my taste. However, it is the finish that does it for me. Hints of sweetness coming through which tease the palate only for the hop bitterness to wallop them. Fantastic mouthfeel.

Very predominantly piney, but also some citrus rind notes. Sticky sap aftertaste. I feel like I might be drinking a pine tree. Dries out totally in the finish. Tastes very fresh. Excellent IPA.

A: Pours a surprisingly pale color for an IPA: a clear straw / pale yellow color that looks more like an APA. Has a sizeable 1.5"" head that remains fluffy for several minutes, receding to a light film on top of the brew and leaving plentiful clumps of lacing down the glass.  S: Grass and citrus hops; it's more lemon than grapefruit, though I do pick up the latter. Slight fruit aromas such as apples and pineapple. Some caramel and biscuit malt underneath it.  T: Grass and citrus (pineapple, lemon) right up front, with the bitterness hitting just a tad later. The mid-taste reveals a slight floral hop character that I never noticed in the smell, with some apple, caramel malt, and biscuit rounding out the flavor. The finish is grapefruit, with lingering bitterness.  M: Medium-to-full bodied with good, nearly crisp carbonation. Has a slightly dry finish and well-masked ABV. I was completely blown away to see that this was 8.5%. Lots of lingering bitterness, for those that like this sort of thing (I don't).  D: I had no trouble finishing a bomber, which incidentally is a good value.

345,14916,FeloniousDrunk,4.22,"Appearance is crystal clear and straw-colored with a nice 2-finger head once poured into a Pint glass. Some lacing and a nice effervescence.  Smell is heavy with hop-bitterness and pine notes. Some barley aromas and maybe crystal malt poke through, but they just give it body for the hop trimmings.  Taste brings the bitter early, with some malted barley middle, and a finish that is tin-dry. This is an IPA that focuses more on tannins and dry bitterness than floral, citrus, or pine flavors. It has a consistent flavor, and the finish really leaves you with a hollow dryness you can feel in your jawbone.  Even-keeled and clear, the mouthfeel is brighter than most IPAs while in the mouth, but leaves an aluminum feel in the mouth that isn't unpleasant, just different.  Drinkability is high for an 8.5 abv beer, provided the bitterness doesn't get to you. The fact is, while drinking the beer is smooth and tasty.

The head left specs of lacing behind.  S - The smells is tons of juicy citrus hops, pine, grapefruit, and it's a bit floral. This beer smells amazing.  T - This packs a big hop punch right off the bat. There is a very nice pink grapefruit taste. It has a big hop bitterness, but is balanced quite well. There is some alcohol presence, but it is hidden quite well. The finish is a lingering hop bitterness.  M - It has a medium body and moderate carbonation. The finish is sticky, bitter, and dry.

The aroma is strong in citrus and pine hops with a sweet malty background. The flavor is hops and more hops! The sweet malts are harder to find in the flavor than they are in the aroma. There's bitterness that remains til the finish. It reminds me of Bell's Hop Slam without the honey. Even with all the hops it's not really out of balance, particularly for a DIPA; it's what you want and expect from a DIPA, or I least I do.  The mouth feel is medium with medium carbonation.

S - Soft pine that is blanketed in a floral, almost perfume like bouquet. A little citrus lingers nicely.  T - Some citrusy floral notes giving way to bitter hops. The hops overpower the German malt completely. Leaves a burnt toast like finish.  M - Medium bodied and carbonated; dry yet crisp.  D - Goes down pretty smooth for 8.5%.

Initial taste is all hops. Some grapefruit rind and big bitterness, followed by a dose of malt and fruit sweetness. This is pushed out by a return of the hop, with a bitter pill lingering flavor. The chemical bitter vs. the true hop flavor are a little off-putting for me, but don't take that much away from the beer. You can sense the alcohol, but not to the point where it gets in the way.  Fuller bodied, chewy, mouth-coating.  A decent drinker.

S: Has a nice citrus aroma to it. I smell grapefruit mainly, not much else. Pretty mild compared to other reviews. T: A nice DIPA. Starts off pretty mild with a light sweetness about it. Then you are hit with the punch of hops. Sharp, acidic hops, a nice taste that is different from any other DIPA I have tried before.

S: Ton of grapefruit, citrus, lemon, pine in the background, smells sweet  T: There's something that just tastes off and soapy. There's almost a cloying sweetness that adds to the off-taste. Citrus flavors are there but seem to fade in and out, there's a good bit of bitterness but I don't really get pine. Finish is bitter soap and medicinal (ibuprofen comes to mind). I'm not sure if it's a combination of the grapefruit and hops, but I just didn't find this pleasant and I generally love grapefruit IPAs (ie, Smuttynose IPA). Perhaps I got a bad bottle.  M: Medium carbonation, medium body, sticky and resiny  D: I did drink this fairly quickly, trying to see if I could get passed the soapiness and make pick something else up, but alas, I couldn't. Just tastes like someone dropped a bar of soap into a rather bland IPA.  I'm not sure if this is a bad bottle or what, but it didn't taste right to me.

Appearance: Light color with a yellowish color, but clear and crisp looking with a head the color of papyrus.  Smell: Strong citrus note, but just like Hop Wallop, I was left searching for more. Unlike the name, my nose was not walloped by the aroma.  Taste: Again, not to be a broken record, but disappointing. Strong malt note with a serious aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Aftertaste is almost overwhelming and very off-putting and there is a dry aspect to the feel.  Drink: It's gone, over, next please.  Conclusion: It went down smooth but the after taste really subtracted from the overall experience.  EDIT: (01/28/2011) Just noticed a thread about this beer concerning a bottling error. The thread described very closely the same experience I had. Just wonder if there's a connection.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

T - Great hop strength with great balance. Not overly malty but good enough to provide significant balance to create a hell of a strong beer.  M - Minimal carbonation. Just enough to keep things moving. Medium to full bodied. Not an overly bitter finish but decent for the style.  D - High. Superb hop shot but could use a tad bit more richness in the malt bill.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Nose doesn't pack the wallop I expected, but can clearly pick out lots of fresh grapefruit, pine, and a sweet tropical fruit undertone, very pleasant. The advertised wallop is delivered in the taste component, with a big hit piney bitterness that seems a bit delayed, but then hits near the finish and lingers and coats the tongue. The fruity notes take a backseat, but are still perceptible throughout, along with a hint of caramel sweetness to help balance out the hops. Medium-bodied and slick, but not syrupy. Nicely balanced DIPA that provides more straightforward bitterness than is suggested by the sweet and fruity aroma.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

White, one finger head leaving a little chunky lacing.  Smell. Sticky citrus hops and some sweet, light malt.  Taste. Pow! Nice hoppy punch with lots of citrus, a little sweetness and enough malt in the middle to prepare you up for that dry, long bitter finish. Not very satisfying as each sip leads to wanting another!!  Mouthfeel. Medium, smooth carbonation with little detectable alcohol.  Drinkability. A great drinker especially considering it's intensity and abv.

345,14916,aerozeppl,4.43,A: One of the best looking IPAs I have ever seen arrive to me via a beer engine. Translucent golden color with just a touch of amber thrown in. Delicate lacing with tons of carbonation. It helps when you have it fresh at the brewery.  S: Wow. Just a blast of fresh hops. Mostly citrus but very fragrant. Quite balanced as well. The more it warmed up the more tropical fruits came out. The malt was crisp. Just a very nice example of the style.  T: Everything you get in a fresh bottle plus one. This is Hop Wallop on 11. Tons of citrus with a touch of tropical fruit. The malt was there and balanced it out quite a bit as well. One of the more balanced DIPAs that I have had recently.  M: Perfect. Delicate carbonation. Smooth and a joy.  D: I forgot about this beer to be honest and I should not have. After I got back from the mini vacation I was on I picked up a six pack of this. Really nice.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Appearance: Pours a hazy light golden color with orange highlights and a 1-2 finger creamy white head.  Smell: Nice mix of sweet and bitter citrus with caramel malt and a hint of pine.  Taste: Sweet citrus up front followed by grapefruit and mild caramel malt in the middle and finishing with resinous pine and lemon peel at the finish. The bitterness is definitely there but not overly so. The aftertaste is lemon peel. The alcohol is very well hidden.  Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Goes down quite smooth.  Drinkability: High drinkability. You could knock back a couple bottles before the alcohol catches up to you.  Overall: Excellent beer overall.

Pours a very clear golden color, decent head with nice lacing, carbonation bubbles evident.  Smells faintly like sticky sweet hops, kind of syrupy, but quite muted.  Taste is smooth and very hoppy. The hops take on a honey-like smoothness, muted citrus flavors and definitely some pine. Finishes prickly and bitter, but the bitterness is otherwise not excessive at all. A very distinct hop profile here, tough to describe in the usual pine/citrus/floral terms. There are no malt flavors here besides some sweetness. The sweet, sticky hop profile becomes a bit much and makes this beer a sipper for me.  Mouthfeel is not too thick, but it leaves a stickiness in the mouth.  This is a good East Coast IPA, for sure. A good find so fresh and I also like that it's in six-packs.

Aroma overall is very unimpressive to me. I love DIPA and this is just lacking in that huge nose I expect. I don't know how old this bottle is, no born on date.  Taste - ok hop flavor, but it tastes more like an imperial pilsner to me. Very little in the way of big west coast hop flavors.

Smell is a bit odd. I get a little bit of wet blanket, which is obviously unexpected. Otherwise, a bit of muted hops come through.  The taste steps it up, though. Great grassy flavor; really earthy. There's a dryness at the back end that's a bit distracting, but it's not horrible. The malts are way secondary, but add some smoothness and very little sweetness. Taste is unique as well- interesting flavor profile that is worth trying.  Mouthfeel is quite nice. Again, the back-end bitterness hangs around due to the stickiness, but the stickiness is a nice compliment to the hop profile.  Drinkability is high...

Good carbonation on the glass. Some cling to the sides of the glass as the beer goes down.  S: First smell I get is tangerine. After that really good overall citrus takes over and great hop presence. The hop nose isnt overpowering or crazy, but certainly enough to let you know what this beer is about.  T/M: Body of this beer is not very thick, and the hops really work well to cleans the mouth. Great hop character up front with that tangerine, orange peel, and lemon taste. Really get the astringent profile all the way through the taste.

345,14916,commis,2.44,"Bottle into a SN tulip.  Very pale. Yellow/orange with just a touch of haze. I enjoy ipa's that look like this, I dig the straw color. Makes it look crisp. Pineapple, peach and plenty of pine. Smells a bit mild and also a bit one dimensional.I want IPA to really hit the nose hard and I can't say that this does that. Kind of harsh in that the alcohol is very present and also the balance between bitter hops and aromatic hop is too far toward the bitter. I'm not getting the lush, fruity and floral flavors to balance the massive bittering additions.And I love huge bittering additions, they just didn't do it right. I would accuse this of not being fresh but the bottle reads: enjoy by aug 2011, so I figure unless they're dating their IPA at a year... Either way, this isn't very good or very bad. The mouthfeel I like. Carbonation is perfect and the body is right where I think it needs to be. Given the spot-on mouthfeel I think this had real potential for higher drinkability in a beer at more than 8%, but it's lack of huge aromas and hop flavors does more to allow the alcohol and bitterness to shine and that makes it less than enjoyable.  Won't give this another chance unless I find out that Victory dates their bottles a year out in which case this bottle is 4 months old. That would be really stupid, though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

An alcoholic bite shows up fairly strong in the middle, and a firm grapefruity bitterness lingers into the aftertaste. The alcohol is pretty hot in this one.

The exotic taste also feels much more present in contrast to the bitterness. The sweetness on the other hand feel a bit artificial.  I really enjoy the mouthfeel of this beer.

Couldn't find a date on the bottle but it was purchased at the brewery so I would hope its fairly fresh, giving it a 3.5 because I've had much better bottles before of the same beer.

T: not the honey as the smell gives away. hops actually wrap under the tongue like a west coast ipa! hops are a nice cross between pine and grapefruit. malt is more of a honey sweetness with the hops giving good bitterness on the back end. M: seems sort of thick due to the honey aroma, yet is very crisp and bitter, with a long lasting hop flavor. carbonation gives a good tingle on the palate.

345,14916,thebrood1987,4.77,Smells like the Hopdevil but this has more of a fresh grapefruit smell from the hops and smells more pungent.The taste is fantastic it hits you with crisp hops a touch of sweet biscuit malt in the middle and a long ending bitter dry finish. You wouldn't pick it up that much in the smell but the high bitterness definitely can pretty much hold up with the West Coast IPA's.This has that same pine resin bitterness which makes the west coast IPA's amazing but also with that classic grapefruit citrus taste of the East Coast IPA's. I'd like to say the perfect way to describe this beer is East Coast IPA meets West Coast IPA meets German malts. If you are in search for that hop bite go for this one. The thing that is unique about this is that its a double IPA. A lot of double IPA's are sweeter and balance the hops out more but not this one. This one still maintains a low malt profile to let those hops really shine through. It really reminds me of an amazing regular IPA with a higher alcohol content that in my opinion is so well masked by the bitterness pine grapefruit taste from the hops. The mouth feel is incredibly smooth and still maintains that fuller mouth feel that a double IPA should have. My favorite beer from Victory. This is better than the Hop Devil because they lower the malt to let those resinous hops shine through a lot more. Yet the malt bill is amazing for the bitter hops. My favorite Victory beers 5.

A bit stronger than standard American IPA's but does not pack the initial bitter tones a lot of other double IPA's do. Thirst quenching with hoppy aftertastes.  D - Very easy for the bomber.

345,14916,TCHopCraver,4,"Hop Wallop pours a golden-yellow straw color into a snifter. A medium pour results in a one-finger head that recedes swiftly and leaves about 75% coverage of nearly pure-white film. I can see some fine sediment throughout the body of the beer, along with small carbonation bubbles that climb at a jogging pace. Lacing left on the glass is quite clingy and leaves big dots and curvy streaks.  I have to be honest, this aroma is really confusing me. My first thought was of a Belgian golden ale as it has a really clean, biscuit-like yeast scent. As it warms a bit, the aroma becomes more freshly floral, with some citrus notes of tangerine and faint grapefruit. Pine, grass, and resin round out the hop profile. Caramel malts nudge their way into the aroma, too, but my main impression is of floral hops and biscuit malt and yeast.  A dry biscuit and pine hop combination debuts on my palate, then a good caramel malt flavor jumps into the equation. All the while, a pairing of resin and really bitter grapefruit nibbles at the the bitter receptors of my palate. Throughout the sip, overtones of flowers, grass, and earth emerge. The flavor is well-balanced for a Double IPA and has the prototypical moisture-sucking finish of bitter hops.  The mouthfeel is essentially about the bitterness of the hops and how they bite at my palate, but the middle of the sip does have a fleeting influence of creamy caramel malt. I would say the carbonation is a little low for the style and the body is on the lighter side of medium.  This is a fairly drinkable Double IPA that has a really huge, bitter hop character. For some reason, though, everything about this beer just seemed a little muted to me, like the aromas and flavors just didn't reach their full potential. I can think of at least a handful of Double IPAs that I would pick over this one, but it is good and I will have it again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,mondegreen,3.68,"12oz into an Allagash Tulip. Enjoy by Oct. 12 2011 stamped in white on the Cartoonish Label.  I'd question how a DIPA can have a freshness date nearly ten months from the day of purchase, but at least this one should be relatively fresh, right?  Pours clear pale gold with a frothy white head that recedes to a thin layer of foam. Leaves moderate lacing.  Aroma is earthy, almost funky hops. Have I gotten a bad 6 pack? When I've had this beer before, I thought I got a bigger citrus element. Now, I get no citrus to speak of. It doesn't smell bad, in fact it is a pretty unique nose.  Taste is bitter. Nowhere near as funky as the nose. A touch spicy, heavy on the pine element, it's a decent DIPA.  Mouth is slightly oily, carbonation is nice.  Drinks very well. I'm questioning if I this beer is a little off, as it doesn't grab me like it has in the past. I had a single from the Jun 2011 batch that had a nice citrus element and big dry hoppy taste. This is almost like a different beer. The unreviewed bottle would have easily been an A-/A.

A nice light straw color with grapefruity hope aromas, this beer definitely packs a hop punch. But it's really well balanced and the bitterness is secondary to the hop aromas and flavors.

Pine and grapefruit and an obvious bitterness, even to the nose, rounded it out.  Very powerfully hoppy with pine and citrus, little sweetness. I thought it was a bit overly bitter and lacked balance, but was still enjoyable.  Feels smooth, more so that expected. Very dry and bitter leaving a lingering bitter aftertaste.

Piney, with hints of grapefruit bitterness in the nose. Fairly floral smelling from a distance.  T - Not as walloped as I had expected from the smell. The bitterness is more subdued than I imagined. It's not an old bottle by any means, so I imagine that's what it's supposed to be like. Still, the pine and grapefruit remain, with little bitterness.  M - Not as bitter, like I said. Therefore the finish is less bitter and the flavor remains on my tongue for less time than I expected.  D - Totally drinkable. Sometimes I have issues with DIPAs due to the bitterness or flavor explosion. This is one of the most well rounded DIPAs I've had in a long time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,infi,3.86,"12 oz. bottle.  Poured into a nonic pint.  Pours a translucent golden-hued, light-orange pour with a nice white foamed head. Great amount of lacing on the glass. On close inspection, there are small amounts of slow moving bubbled streams rising towards the top. Not a lot of carbonated activity on sight alone. Smell carries a huge amount of honey sweetness, but a very minimal amount of hop pine and citrus. Average overall; not bad, but just okay.  Taste has a nice crispness to it with the hops shining through from beginning to end. Great amount of grapefruit pith and flesh, earthy pine needles, along with the dryness and bitterness. The finish is mainly just a short bitterness on the palate. Straight forward DIPA, with everything in line.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with low carbonated activity, but smoothly crisp. Great palate presence of the beer overall. Easy to drink; 8.5% is the only thing that will impede from drinking multiple bottles in a short amount of time. Currently my favorite Northeastern IPA now. Could have used a bit more hop in its walloping, but a solid DIPA still.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Nice looking big bottle. Enjoy by JUN 24 2011. A snifter is the best glass I could find.  A- Clear dark yellow gold. White head with good retention.  S- Smells great. I'm thinking fresh clover honey with mandarin zing. Seems pretty balanced and sweet. Some malted grain in there too. Kind of mouthwatering. Mango came out later. Also some apricot jam.  T- Whoa. A lot more beer in here than I thought! By more beer I mean, more body, deeper flavour than the appearance and smell even, led me to believe. Not as sweet as the smell though. A bit of chamomile. Very strong bitterness which lingers all over the back of my tongue and throat but tastes great. Alcohol is hot and shows up more and more as the brew warms.  M- Medium but very good body. Medium to high carbonation foams up a great deal. Smooth. Finishes with reasonably dry and a little sticky.  D- Tastes great. The bitterness might turn off some though. I think two pints would be a good amount before the bitterness or alcohol get to you.  Great. Want more.

There is a low to average amount of carbonation showing and there is a fair amount of lacing on the sides of the glass. The head stuck around for a few minutes before it was gone.  Smell - caramel, oranges/grapefruit, hops, pine  Taste & Mouth - The beer has an average amount of carbonation and it has a very dry feel. There is a lot of hop taste mixed with caramel, malts, and grapefruit. There is also some notes of pine and the beer has a dry woodiness aspect to it. I can also pick up on a few fruit esters as well. The beer finishes with a dry pine and hoppy aftertaste.

Taste - def hope taste with an added pine to finish. Very ""dry"" tasting beer with a prolonged aftertaste of pine that stays around.

A bit of spent yeast is floating in my glass. That's okay though, as I purposely pour aggressively.  S: My first scent is dank hops. Smells like good marijuana. A bit of pine is there, with a hint of booze mixing with some nutty caramel malts in the background.  T: Interesting. It certainly has a malt backbone to support the ""wallop,"" but it doesn't have the bitter hop bite in the back that I'm used to in aggressive IPAs. It actually goes down quite smooth, given the 8.5%ABV and hop character present. Maybe since I heard they date their ""Enjoy By"" dates a year in advance, some of the hop potency has fallen off.  F: Medium body. The malts lend enough to provide a full and creamy mouthfeel, which I enjoy. The hop profile does a nice job of drying the palate on the finish.  D: There's a slight tinge of alcohol here, so unless I was pounding a sixer at a party, I don't know if I could do too many in a row.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,FosterJM,4.15,80th review on BA Bottle to Tulip  App- Hazy orange sunset with a very minor head on it. Looked very delicious in the glass.  Smell- Hoppy with some very big citrus. It smelled like a Victory. I think almost all of their beers have been similar in smell just different notes to them.  Taste- A spicy IPA with some very big citrus flavors behind it. I liked it. I had heard good things about this and wasn't dissapointed.  Mouth- Somewhat lightly carbonated with flavors that were citrusy as stated but picked up a mild and delicate piny taste.  Drink- A very nicely done DIPA. Would have this one again and tell some friends about it.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Yeasty, with citrus notes. However, the hoppiness was not as intense as I expected ... very subdued.  T: Hmmmm... Hop Devil on acid, with the Victory ""taste profile"" waiting in the wing. Actually, I could have used more grapefruit/orange/lemon taste in general. However, the finish was remarkably smooth.  M: I could definitely taste the alcohol here which was not pleasant. The carbonation here was extreme in the strictest sense of the word. That may have worked well in the Helios, but not here.  D: I try this beer every year and I totally want to route for it because of my affection for Victory.

345,14916,JAXSON,4.05,"2009 rate.  Draft. Pours a clear gold with a white head. For some reason I want this to be a darker shade of orange. Really grassy, hoppy aroma. Fresh and bright. Not much citrus presence, but a fresh, bitter hoppiness that is likened most to grass. Good.  Had this a few times since the original rate and I was more impressed, so I upped the rating. Of course freshness is a huge deal with this one.  December 2011 edit. Tried this next to Ranch S, which is a bit of a mess. I came to appreciate the dryness and balance of this. Really comes across as a handful of freshly boomed hop flowers, a harvest ale more than an imperial pale ale.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

M- Medium to thicker mouthfeel. Nice carbonation sting...might be my favorite part about this beer.  D/O- Very different than the ""usual"" DIPA I was expecting.

345,14916,laituegonflable,3.86,"Pours a gold colour, very shiny and clear with no carbonation. Doesn't need it though, because the head is retaining beautifully. Bubbly, but dense on top and thick. Lace is gorgeous, nice sticky webs. Great look.  Smells tasty. Lots of American hops, but a good malt base with sticky cake dough and some light cereal grain. Hops are floral and citric, nice fruity characters but yeah, nice floral fragrances coming off. Slight musky as well. Yeah, pleasant.  Taste is also pleasant. Malty for the most part, caramel with some rich vanilla bean and some slight vinous notes underlying that then evolve into the hoppiness, which is tasty; nice citric bitterness that finishes well. Yet it's still a bit subdued and could use more robust hopping. Nice citric zest and some woody, resiny notes; finishes with a touch of rosewater and some mild licorice as well. Yeah, not a mind-blowing IPA but a very enjoyable one, nicely brewed.  A bit harsh actually on the feel, just slightly too much bubbliness. A good thick, rich body nonetheless.  An enjoyable drop of beer that could have been more enjoyable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,lacqueredmouse,3.61,"Purchased in California, transported back to Sydney, and cracked open with @LaitueGonflable to celebrate my moving house.  Pours a light but deep golden colour, with a thick and frothy head of white foam, perfectly formed and amazingly rich. Lacing is gorgeous, a sudsy mess of collapsing bubbles. Colour is quite pale, and the body is surprisingly light, but otherwise it's a fine looking brew.  Nose is a little thin, some slightly resiny hop character, a slight medicinal character, but not particularly big or robust. Even a slightly musty grain note, giving a little rankness, and a slight whiff of yeast. It's not a particularly engaging nose, overall.  Taste is more pleasant, a slightly nutty bitterness with a light grain character on the back. Finish has a touch of hop oil to keep it fresh, and a dryness on the back palate which is refreshing. Quite a light feel, with a slight aldehyde character on the back.  It's decent enough, but this beer is a classic example of why the west coast beats the east cost in IPAs every time. It has the astringent hops, but not the flavour and the character. Pleasant enough, and drinkable in its way, but I can probably think of a score of other IPAs I prefer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

On first taste, im hit with an immediate giant grassy/piney hop flavor with a sweet malty backbone, just enough to keep your tongue from drying out from the bitterness. I love the bite on this one!

S - Lemony, malty and a tartness to the hop existence that was rather pleasing.  T - maltier than I would have expected at first sip. The malty characteristics quickly disappear in favor of the full on hop bitterness, followed by a sweet honey finish and a lingering aftertaste similar to celery of all things. Alcohol taste is not even a remote factor. I would not have guessed that this is like 8.5 ABV  M - More syrupy than thin, but not overly so. Dry with medium carbonation.

345,14916,Zimbo,3.55,Cloudy yellow with some foamy of white head. No beading. Similar to the eye to BrewDog Punk IPA. Head diappears over the course of the glass. A reasonable acidic start with a fair degree of bitter citric flavours. Not really a wallop at all but more of a lingering long bitterness. Better mouthfeel though which is full and involving to the taste.But structurally this falls apart fairly quickly leaving a soupy jammy quality without much dimension.

The taste starts with a nice amount of malt which is quickly overpowered by a firm bitter hoppy finish, make no mistake hops dominated the flavor profile of this beer, the finish is long and hoppy. Personally I do not like when the hops linger and destroy the palate; this is one of those kind of beers so it loses points for me. The most memorable thing on the flavor profile is how long the bitteness holds on for after each sip. The mouthfeel is a little syrupy which is kind of expected given the ABV.  Overall this is a good beer, not my favorite because of the lingerin hoppiness. I like the hops to eventually subside, which they do no in this beer.

Three fingers of souffle head that rises another finger above the rim of the glass, light cream color. Good-lookin' brew. Leaving thin strips of sticky lacing.  Bitter orange & grapefruit up front in the nose, tea, some mildly biscuity malt holding it up. Good but nothing out of the ordinary.  Taste is definitely hop-forward, giving me a strong dose of citrus flesh up front, soon followed by a bracingly bitter pith taste. Subtle sweetness follows up, with kind of a dry, cracker malt, & a long aftertaste of dry pine. Whew, this baby is bitter!  Moderately full-bodied, active without being sharp, with a caustic afterfeel.  Good example of the style, but I feel it's pretty standard & doesn't really offer anything above & beyond what's expected.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,nhindian,3.36,"A - Pours a clear, light, straw color that builds a really pleasant 2-finger, creamy head. Sticks around forever too, considering the ABV of this IPA. Minimal lacing to say the least. Can see a steady stream of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass.  S - Actually smells fairly mild for an Imperial IPA. The nose is mostly piney hops, but not much citrus or grapefruit. Not much of a wallop on the bouquet but at least it seems balanced. Floral notes dance around the hops but are clearly crowded away from the dance.  T - I take my first sip and... bam. There's the wallop. Very bitter hop-forwardness with not much citrus to back-up the calvary. Unfortunately this one seems a bit one-sided towards bitterness, which I thought due to the mild nose might be a bit more complex, but not this time. Upon further drinking and warming up, the citrus does make an appearance, but it is a minor role and is quickly drowned out by more hops.  M - Feels medium- to heavied- bodied. Definitely is no weak foe to crush. Strong carbonation which tingles the tongue and helps activate the taste buds. Enjoyable to drink.  D - The drinkability really takes a hit due to this beers bitter-forward taste. Would be hard to pound a few of these within the course of a night.

M - Mouthfeel is bold and medium density.  D - Easy to drink but at 8.5% it'll catch up to you quickly.

There is a nice .5 inch head that is solid white with very little retention and some lace.  S - Intense tropical fruit hints. Grapefruit and peaches with some nice tangerines. The citrus aromas are the most intense part of the nose. Any sweetness that comes through is mostly from a nice tropical fruit aroma. Nice lemon peel as well as some nice spice notes. Great passion fruit notes as well.  T & M - Starts off with an intense hop citrus character as well as some nice tropical fruit hints and sweetness. The hop character and flavor can be compared t some grapefruit and orange with some nice lemon peel in there as well. There are some slight piney notes as well. It has some nice sticky in the mouthfeel that coats the mouth quickly. The beer is pretty bitter but the intensity isn't too overwhelming. Seems like a DIPA that could be used to get people into DIPA's from regular IPA's.  D - Very good for a beer with this much flavor and 8.5 ABV.

345,14916,zoso493,4.12,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams sensory glass.  Appearance: Hop Wallop pours a bright, radiant golden-orange color that is much less hazy than your average DIPA. It's not transparent, but it does have much more of a straw tone to it than a typical IPA. Already I can see there's loads of carbonation contributing to a healthy and thick two-finger head that looks like it's about to unload with lacing on the glass.  Smell: This is a beautifully scented IPA. It's got a big juicy and floral hop character right up front that is exactly what you want in a DIPA. Victory chose to give this one the signature caramel goody malt for this one, which is just fine for my liking. Definitely smells like it deserves a sip.  Taste: This is a bitter beer to be sure, as the hops come right out immediately in the taste. The tastes seem a bit jumbled, though, and it's hard to pick out much besides bitterness. The malts are also far less present in the taste than they should be, which leads to a bit of a soapy taste. I'm a huge advocate of immensely hopped beers, but this one needs some balance to relieve the cloying. Still, a good fix for a hop head.  Mouthfeel: Hop Wallop is certainly adequately thick for a DIPA despite being pretty highly carbonated. This carbonation, though, doesn't serve to wick some of the cloying sensation of the palate, which goes to show how over-hopped this beer really is.  Drinkability: While the alcohol is very tidily masked in this brew, I couldn't have more than a couple. Still, I am enjoying this bottle and would definitely like to try it again.  All in all, Hop Wallop is a very good DIPA. I can't stress enough the need for a little bit more malt balance. It takes a lot for a hop head to say something like that, but it's true. My only other gripe with this beer is that I can't find a bottling date on it for the life of me, which is pretty critical for an IPA. It is, though, a very nice brew and one that I would love to have again, especially if I found it on tap.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,liddytime,2.3,"I had high hopes for the Hop Wallop, perhaps on account of the slobbering, cartoon, 49-er character on the label. That guy is awesome!  The brew poured a straw-yellow with a healthy, cloud-like head around the glass-rim.  The aroma was hoppy - but not the piney-citrusy-fruity hoppy I was expecting. It was more of an earthy-grassy-sour-pungent hop aroma.  The taste was also disappointing. The hop oils coated my mouth and reminded me of the orange-blossom oil they put in your water at middle-eastern restaurants...not in a good way... It also tasted ""soapy"" and acrid, almost bilious, not pleasant at all. I thought I might have gotten a bad bottle so I tried another. Same result. I suppose I could have gotten a bad six-pack. The mouthfeel was thin and I didn't get any of the bready, maltiness I was expecting.  I love IPA's so I was more than disappointed with Victory's Hop Wallop. I may give it another shot at some point because my sixer really didn't taste quite right.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,schoolboy,3.9,"I like this a lot more than my ratings. Gee, how about all 5's. You can't do that. It's not realistic. But here you have a creative brew, but it ain't perfect. Perfect would be boring.  It hits you up side the head like it should. Hops and uniqueness come oozing from every sip. Lots of hoppy bitterness.  The color is light. The malt is almost not present in the taste - it's all hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,salvo,4.09,"Hazy light yellow/brown with red highlights. Head foamed lightly then collapsed quickly leaving lots of streaking on the glass on the way down.  Smell is sweet honey and biscuit malt with fresh hay and brown sugar in the background. Faint graham cracker.  All the smell, all the complexity is gone on the first sip: a biting, cutting astringent hop shot numbs the taste buds along with the higher alcohol which is not well masked. Not a complaint but a description. The astringency and alcohol warmth spreads across the tongue across the back of the throat and up to the upper palate.  Mouthfeel is rich, layered, buttery, and welcome. Drinkability suffers form high alcohol, but this is a wonderful beer.  More than a hop wallop, this beer packs a hop after-wallop. It's welcome, too.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

I compare it to a punch in the face of hops...in a good way.  MF: Light body, but with a tangy feeling on the tongue.  D: Hard to say. This would kill my palate pretty quickly, that and the high ABV, so I would say that hurts the drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,Lldeegan,4.1,"In the glass it is pale orange/golden straw colored with a white fluffy head and moderate retention. Sweet pale malt kicks off the smells and then fruity, citrus hop notes fill out the aroma. Nice creamy sweet malt flavors roll in, followed up by a fruity then bitter hop bite. Biscuity, bready and buttery malt flavors and piney, bitter grapefruit hop flavors combine to make a nice hoppy beer with a strong malt backbone. Very interesting taste, with an intriguing balance of sweet malt and bitter hops. The balance allows for minimal palette fatigue, which makes this a very drinkable beer. The flavors give the devoted hophead what they want but the malt adds dimension to keep you filling up your pint with this delicious brew. A good afternoon beer to have with lunch, especially a hearty meat and cheese sandwich.

Very nice appearance. S: Freshly mowed lawns and corn husks. T: No mysteries here, a clear sharp hop note (actually din) right off. A lot of pine rather than citrus (in fact no citrus), some bread dough in the end but... Not a lot of other textures or tastes, and it finishes a bit weak. M: A little soapy. Does not hold up very well after the first hop hit. Despite the head retention, very little carbonation detected on the tongue. D: Not my cup of tea. I'll pass.

345,14916,ToasterChef,4.1,"I jotted down a few notes on the second day of the NERAX @ Novare cask festival, which is where I sampled this beer. I have previously had this beer in a bottle, but never reviewed it. This time around, on cask, it has a dirty hop flavor. The color is golden with a soapy white head. There is a foresty pine scent. Serving this beer mostly flat and warmer than normal still produces a yummy treat. The alcohol and bitterness add a touch of heat that I like. It retains its medium/full bodied feel. There is still a coat as well that has a little bit of the hop flavor. It's very drinkable and appealing to me right now, but everything else I've had at the fest so far this day has been low-hopped. Having this glass reminds me to get another bottle of this one soon.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,drizzam,4.5,"A - Poured a cloudy light orange. An aggressive pour yielded a very nice two finger eggshell white head. Head retention was excellent and a beautiful lacing was left down the inside of my pint glass.  S - This brew has a very nice hoppy nose to it...grapefruit and pineapple abound. If it tastes half as good as the aroma lets on, this is going to be one fabulous beer!  T & M - Mmmmm...this is a hoplicious brew! That same fruity hop aroma I smelled in the nose is front and center in this dank, hoppy brew. It's not one dimensional though, as it is balanced with a nice amount of sweet malt. A very creamy brew, that finishes with a bit of hop kick in the mouth.  D - If you like hops, you need to get your hands on one of these bad boys! I'm very impressed, especially since it sat in my fridge all Summer and I was afraid it would have mellowed. This is something for the Victory Brewing Company to be proud of.

Just a hint of alcohol warmth. M- Very slightly sticky yet also sort of dry. Nice carbonation level. D- An intense beer and one to be savored. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

A bright, hazy golden color with a 3 finger white head. I'm thinking Saison... The head settles to a frothy cap, leaving some rings and spots of lacing behind.  Hmm... certainly some booze to this beer! Maybe 9 to 10%? Big bitterness in this too-- so Saison seems to be out... Hints of pine and pineapple and grapefruit... So an IPA? DIPA? The fruit notes seem muted and faded... The smell is really weak.  A light faint malt is up front, but not offering big sweetness. This is a good base to build a super hoppy DIPA from-- but those hops seem to be lacking!?  The body is medium. Decent carbonation.  The beer is decent, but not worth picking up again. The hops need to be stepped up in order for this to work-- and this isn't working right now.  Rips open envelope...  Victory Hop Wallop. Hmmm... I hate to say it, but this is the 4th mediocre beer I've had from Victory. I'm glancing at other reviews of this beer right now and I'm thinking this must not have been fresh! I don't know if Victory does any bottle dating (the label was ripped off the bottle as part of the BIF, so I am unsure how old or fresh this one is).

Hoppy on seven different levels, very pleasant.  T - Slick hop oil leads into a firm but not harsh bitterness. There is a substantial malt sweetness holding up the citrus blast of hops flavor. Pine resin, green apples, orange rind, with a touch of honey. Very clean fermentation and finish. Alcohol warmth is noticed in the throat/belly.  M - Medium bodied, lower levels of carbonation than most would expect here, but not under done... Very clean finisher.

Light pine with some sweetness to round everything out. T: Plenty of fruity flavors that follow the nose. Citrus and grapefruit are big. A substantial, but not over done bitterness. A bit more resiny pine with a grainy malty sweetness for balance. M/D: A medium body that is creamy and smooth from the cask. Really easy to drink considering the alcohol.

The beer hits your tongue and give the slightest bit of sweetness before the appropriately named hop wallop is delivered.

T- Quite a bit of a tropical fruit here grapefruit and orange. For sure reminds me of some Great Lakes brews right between CP and Monster.

Poured into a pint glass, Hop Wallop flowed from it's bottle and rolled into my glass, the color was surprisingly yellow, but once the glass was full it glimmered a delicate light gold. Poured very well with a two finger head that just peered over the brim of the glass. The head lasted a few moments and then began to fad, leaving behind a beautiful sticky lace in it's place. The smell is sweet. A very fruity and pleasant smell. It smells of oranges, lemons, and most of all I think cumquat. At first a small sip shows no mercy, a powerful hop profile hits you, complex and strong, hops! Theres a slightly spicy note then it mellows out leaving the citrusy characteristic I smelled, but not sweet this time, a delicious bittery citrus instead, grapefruit. A large sip reveals something else, something a little sweeter at first then bitter. Very little carbonation, the beer feels light but also dense.  I love this beer.

Citrus hops follow. Grassy hops. Hints of tropical fruits, especially pineapple. Strong bitter finish. Puckering. I'm licking my lips. This is very good.  Mouth is oily with an astringent finish.  Drinkability is fantastic. Relatively high ABV is hidden well and this ale has a refreshing and crisp nature. I could drink this all day long were it not for the alcohol content.

345,14916,liamt07,4.1,"Bottle courtesy of 67couple, poured into a tulip with a BBD of March 25, 2011. Cheers dude!  Pours a bright and clear mandarin orange, with a couple of fingers of very slightly offwhite head. Settles to a thin layer, and leaves minimal lace. Aroma is of lemon rind, oranges, a touch of grapefruit, pineapple and other fruits, lingering amongst a sweet and toffee like malt. Truly a citrus explosion here. Taste is initially extremely bitter, on the verge of being cloyingly so. Likely the most bitter thing to hit my lips in recent memory, wow. This effect lessens as the beer warms however. I'm finding it hard to determine the flavours underneath this overwhelming bitterness, but I can dig out the sweet malt which coats the mouth initially and a quick blast of citrus (mostly lemon and pineapple?) which follows it. I love me a bitter beer, and this certainly exceeds any expectations I had of how bitter this would come across. A hint of alcohol is felt at the end of the mouth, but is almost invisible. Bitterness lingers indefinitely on the tongue and is relatively dry as well. Medium-high carbonation, smooth on the mouth as well. Drinkability takes a bit of hit here because of the limited amount of this I could put back without permanent tastebud damage. Recommended, and quite solid for the style.

345,14916,rembrant,4.32,"Nice head on a golden brew with some haziness.Aroma? HOPS....fresh mown grass,some trace of orange peel and floral but mainly big fresh hops. There's a note of alcohol if you look for it, but subtle for this ABV  Flavor...HOPS...very nice whole hops in a rather distinctive blend,slightly buffered by the malt that sweetens the aftertaste a little. There's a hint of Nor Cal Killer Buds from around Humbolt Co.,some juniper and pine,Rosemary,hints of citrus.  The aim was to showcase prized hops more than get balance or a classic IPA. The big plus there is they did it with FLAVOR and not just a bitterness overkill.  Mouthfeel is medium,which is a bit more body than avg for a IIPA. Carbonation is about right, gentle sparkle but not 7-up-ish.  DEFINITE multi-layered hop/bitter/tang that lasts with some hop oils cling to my mustache and lips  Drinkable? Yes Though the hops dominate they avoided an excessive or abrasive bitter slam.

At first it's citrus, then bitter hop oils and a kick of pine. An offering of caramel malt really holds this brew together. This is a very balanced DIPA, without sacrificing the punch of citrus and bitterness from the delicious hops. Good residuals left behind...nice and oily.

Palate is jammed with crisp citrus hop flavor and a healthy bite from the 8.5%. Just enough malt flavor for balance and complexity.

Poured into tulip with a large white head that thins out into lacing. The color is light straw and there is no haze at all. This is much lighter in color than I expected. Very impressive appearance.  Smell is disappointing for a DIPA. Not enough hop aroma for my liking; instead sweet malt and candy.  The taste is very astringent as should be expected. The bitterness dominates and only a hint of hop flavor remains.  Mouthfeel is above average and drinkability is average for the style. A fresher bottle might up the drinkability though.

345,14916,rand,4.22,"From bottle to pint glass  A: Pours a clear, yellow-orange with little carbonation and a small but tightly-formed head. If it wasn't for the somewhat oily texture and lack of head, this could almost pass for macro swill.  S: Fresh pine and citrus but there's an unusual, earthy, slightly sour funk in the backdrop  T: At first this hits like a standard, well-crafted DIPA with strong pine and orangey citrus. The alcohol isn't hidden either and reveals itself right up front. But about half-way through the sip the hops take a strange detour and rise up into this earthy, funky, almost sour-peach flavor, which finishes battling the alcohol and malty sweetness. This is followed by a spicy bitter aftertaste.  M: Much more rich and viscous than it appears. You can pick up a slightly oily texture to this brew when staring at its head, but the association to macro lager will lead your mouth to expect something watery, and this is nicely full-bodied.  Drinkability and notes: I'm not sure typical drinkabilty points apply here. This is an extremely pronounced and bitter brew and not something I would recommend to anyone that hasn't acquired a taste for super-hoppy ales. However, it offers hopheads a new twist on the DIPA hop profile, and does this tasting good. Instead of adding or combining ingrediants, it seems like they used an unsual yeast or process (I'm stabbing in the dark here, I've never home brewed) with your standard IPA recipe. Hop Wallop is a new reference point for 'unique IPA'",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Truly is more lemony than grapefruit which is not that common from my experience. Bitterness is a little more intense than some, but I would still say it's well balanced.  M - Lacks in carbonation.

345,14916,stakem,3.93,Review from notes taken 6/22/10 at Als of Hampden during the intro to the beer engines. $2 nonic glass.  Appears a hazed golden yellow color with a finger of off-white head. Lace clings in spotty patches all about the glassware. The aroma is mostly hop character showcasing an herbal scent with some citrus and grassy notes. Also included in the aroma is a bit of grainy biscuit malt. Taste is along the same character a outlined in the aroma along with an alcohol presence that is a little bitey and warming. The finish accents the spice of the hops tasting herbal with some citrus.  Medium feel with a light level of carbonation. As it warms the flavor of the hops takes on more of a grassy flavor and increased grainy sweetness that balances out the alcohol and hop bitterness nicely. A very good brew all together and impossible to ignore for the price.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,HosP,3.89,"Big thanks to Scottfrie for this bomber or goodness!  A- Poured nice golden, orange color. Slight haze to it with nice finger size white head. Left some lace on the glass as well.  S- Up front lemony citrus hop aroma. Piney hop smell mixed in as well. Hint of malt towards the end, but very subtle.  T- Very nice piney hop flavor up front. More sweet than I was expecting. The citrus, lemony bitterness came in fast and took over. Nice malty backbone at the end rounded out this drink. Higher alcohol was present towards the end of the drink, but nothing bad.  M- Nice medium body. Nice carbonation. Oily presence on the way down, but good bitterness.  D- Very solid DIPA. Very interesting from start to finish. Thought it was going to be overly hoppy, but malt's balanced out more than imagining them to. Still a wonderful beer!  Scottfrie just keeps hooking me up with some great DIPA's! Thanks again!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Pdiddey3d,4.02,"Pours a bright golden color. Much more yellow than most IPAs I've had in the past. About one finger of white head and almost zero lacing as I drink.  Very nice aroma. This is the highlight for me. Very crisp and fresh hop aroma, pine, green apples, pineapple, citrus. A hint of malts as well. just a delicious scent.  Very hoppy. Smack of bitterness up front, orange peel, maybe some peach/apricot fruitiness. Interesting flavors. This is super hoppy but not to sour or acidic as I would have imagined.  Good mouthfeel, smooth to drink but the finish is somewhat bitter and oily. I would say the drink-ability suffers here due to the finish and the strong flavor profile. Very good but a one and done for me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

T-Fruity in the front of the tongue followed by a moderate bitterness. After a few sips the floral character is a hard to detect and the bitterness dominates, but it isn't overwhelming. Some alcohol is noted but mostly well hidden.  M-Medium body and smooth.  D-If you're a hop head who likes floral and fruity hop flavors I think you will be happy with this beer. It goes down easy and with each sip, I look forward to another one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Taste's almost pilsner-ish on the first sip. Pilsner infused with a ridiculous amount of hops. Has a lemon citrus zing on the forefront, a bready body.. and an earthy bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is clean until the aftertaste.. which is somewhat sticky.  High drinkability for me as it's not as overwhelming as most IPA's, but hoppy = happy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,silentjay,3.51,"pours a very clear and bright gold with a decent white head that retains and laces well.  aroma is rather muted with some lemon and herbal hops being most dominant. some white bread and cooked veggies round out a rather unappealing aroma.  taste is much better, but still lemon is most dominant. tropical fruits, pine, and fresh cut grass make an appearance not hinted at in the aroma and it is most welcome. white bread, biscuit, and toast add some malt to the flavors. citrus hops are the story, here though, and they are pretty tasty.  mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a bit too much carbonation and just a touch of oil/resin left in the mouth with a bitter finish.  drinks decently. taste far exceeds what the appearance and aroma promised, but does not quite wow me.

It poured with a small white head that quickly faded away into lacy patterns of bubbles that consistently covered the surface. S: There are moderate aromas of citrus and pine resin hops in the nose. T: The overall taste is dominated by flavors of both citrus and pine resin hops. There is a lot of bitterness (particularly in the finish) but it's not overpowering; the initial taste has some hints of malty sweetness. M: It feels medium-bodied, crisp and smooth on the palate. There is some dryness in the finish.

345,14916,Beerenauslese,4.5,"Pours clear gold with an ample head that dissipates to a fine ring leaving some lacing.  Bready and vegetal/floral green hop aromas.  Malty and bready taste then a green hop wallop, but is not bitter and finishes really smooth, supported by malty sweetness.  Adding to the smoothness is the medium body combining with the carbonation to give this a super creamy mouthfeel.  At 8.5% ABV, the alcohol is well hidden, and this is just a wonderful DIPA that I can drink plenty of.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,MbpBugeye,3.82,"Enjoy by May 3 2011 stamped on the label. This isnt my first time having this beer but it is my first time in an environment in which I can review.  A- Super pale yellow that is barely hazed. I didnt get much of a head, but I didnt pour very hard either. What did foam up was a one finger height of pure white bubbles. They all faded leaving some stuck behind on the glass.  S- Lots of pine, flowers, grass, tangerines. Its pretty much straight forward hoppy. Citrus is pretty strong and very sweet and candied smelling. As it warms Im picking up a weird aroma of corn or rice.  T- Pine and sweet citrus are the two dominant flavors. Resinous pine, sweet tangerine and cracker malts.  M- Lighter and very crisp. Biting, dry finish.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Manoftyr,4.32,"Appearance-Pours a clear light amber yellow into the glass and gives rise to about two fingers of head, substantial lacing is left along the edges as it recedes.  Aroma-I smell citric and fruity hops upfront, a whole overload of them imparting aromas like pineapple, apple, grapefruit, a little bit of orange and a smidgen of spice that almost smells like good aged cheese. There's hardly any aroma imparted by the malt, this is a hop show through and through.  Taste-A sticky-sweet attack of citric fruitiness reminiscent of the aroma comes forward first followed by a resiny piny bitterness. For such a hop bomb this beer really isn't all that bitter, it's more fruity and citric than anything else; still damn tasty.  Mouthfeel-Rich, sappy, resiny; what you'd expect from a class DIPA.  Drinkability-Great, a six pack of this can go pretty quick amongst a couple beer enthusiasts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,SolomonGrundy,3.54,"Trip to the ol' Barn replenished me stock for the weekend, so....Beautiful light amber color that pours with a finger or two of marshmallow-y head. Persistent and leaves decent lace for an IPA. Smells super-hopped, as one might guess from the name, but contains other elements also: maybe some pineapple and something off, like maybe a dirty sock across the room or an aged Manchego cheese. Not sure what to make of it, but the hops is very prevalent. Oh, some neat stuff in the flavor. A lot of the IPA elements are there, obviously, but also a new flavor or two. I'm thinking maybe not-quite-ripe banana and orange zest. Interesting but not astounding. I likey. $4.99/bomber so it's average priced. Worth drinking if you see it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,bobsy,4,"I was convinced that I'd reviewed this one before, but alas, no.  Pours a rich orange with a finger of white head that laced nicely as it dropped to a fine film. Good all-round appearance. Fairly standard aroma for the style has all the right elements in place and nothing out of the ordinary - citrus, pine, caramel, slight hint of alcohol. It may not be groundbreaking, but its a great showcase for hops.  The flavour is a touch unbalanced, as this style often can be, with the hops muscling out the malts almost completely. As expected there's a whole load of citrus, coming through as grapefruit zest and lemon, which is complimented by pine. This packs a nicely bracing bitterness, but the relegation of the malts to only the lightest of caramel notes prevents it from becoming world class. The medium body and carbonation work well with the flavour, and keeps to Victory's high standard.  A very good beer that's just missing that extra element to push it over the top - still, its a hop lover's dream.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,DaveHS,4.42,"Poured into a Hopdevil pint glass. Pours a rusty orange with about half an inch of eggshell white head. Leaves moderate, soapy lacing. Light aromas of citric hops and soft thin malt, not much else. This is a really solid DIPA. Simple and successful in its execution, and very different from IPAs made on the West Coast. There is a light pleasant bitterness up front that gives way to a citric hop profile. Some light pininess underneath. Delicate, thin sweetness plays nicely against the bitterness in the finish. This is a great go-to DIPA, competitively priced with local (San Francisco area) beers. As a former resident of the great state of Pennsylvania, I am happy to see this available in California. I have a feeling I will be buying a lot of it over the next few months.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,mlazzaro,4.12,"Orangy in color. A not quite white creamy looking head.  Immediately I find the smell powerful and delicious. I haven't even put my nose to the glass and I can smell citrousy hoppy goodness.  Very apparent bitterness, delicious hop qualities. Nice alcohol to compliment the bitterness. Powerful hoppy flavors and smells going on. Extremely flavorful while retaining a quality mouthfeel. A very balanced American Double IPA, often not the case with this style.  Lingering flavors. I assumed the A.B.V. was 6-7 and found it to be 8.5. Beer is very well attenuated, tastes great considering ethanol content.  once again, compliments to the chefs. cheers",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Phillyphilms,3.27,From bottle to pint.  Poured a hazy orange gold with a great couple fingers of head. Head hangs out for a bit with significant lacing. The hops aren't really there in the nose as much as you'd think from a DIPA but still some present along with pine. Much more hops on the tongue and more pine and citrus too. Lots hidden in this beer from nose to mouth but all that hangs around on the tongue after the swallow. Alcohol don't hide much with this boozy finish and 8.5 that reminds you of itself post sip. A decent example of a double IPA that provides both a hope and alcohol wallop.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,TMoney2591,3.88,"Served in a shaker pint glass at ChurchKey.  I've been promised wallops of hops before...we'll see. This contender pours a clear pale straw topped by a half-finger (at best) of white foam. The nose comprises earth, florals, and a bit o' toffee. A little simplistic and not very hoppy. The taste holds some heavy floral and citrus hops, backed by a comparatively meek bit o' caramel. Alright, I'll admit the hops' supremacy...but I don't know if I'd go so far as a wallop. They are pretty strong, though... The body is light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Not a bad DIPA overall, but not quite as strong as expected. Its lack of balance keeps it from attaining any measure of real greatness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,MeisterBurger,3.88,"Pours an orangey straw color, cloudy with tons of floaties in it, topped by a healthy white head. It looks the part except the floaties are a mite off-putting, I must confess.  Pine, citrus and a lightly toasty caramel dominate what is, for the style, a fairly muted aroma.  Tastes like...hop juice. Liquid pine needles with a lingering bitterness. It's all just citrusy, lemony, very piney c-hops. Not bad in the least, but kind of one-dimensional -- the hops don't balance the malt so much as obliterate it from existence. Which, considering the name, I'm quite sure was on purpose, so I can't exactly fault the lack of malt presence here.  Medium bodied, nicely carbonated.  A full out hop assault, and an enjoyable one if you like a good palate thrasher. Good for a hop fix and worth getting again at $1.89 a bottle. Mostly, though, it just made me really, really thirsty.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Lolli1315,4.12,"A- An orange yellow color that is slightly hazy. Less than a finger of patchy white head that forms a nice ring around the glass. The little amount of head there is holds decently with moderate lacing.  S- A nose full of lemon and citrus that is followed by a slight piney hops with a slight alcohol finish. The mix of citrus and hop oils mix great.  T- Slight sweet malt before the beer turns to sharp piney bitterness. The citrus that was evident in the smell nowhere nearly as strong in the taste as once the pine hops hit they don't go away. Slight alcohol bite towards the ends out the beer, but just like the rest of the beer bitterness rules the aftertaste as well.  M- Relatively thick mouthfeel with a certain syrupy feel to it. Thin to medium amount of carbonation, seems to be the area where it is lacking.  D- The bitterness hammers the mouth quite a bit, covering up most other flavors taking back from the drinkability somewhat. Still a great beer though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Patchmaster,4.15,"I was craving a good DIPA at the store and didn't want to go with the 22oz bomber. So decided I would go with the pick 6. The hop wallop was part of the mix and thought I would try it out first.  A - Nice cloudy orange color with a thick head. Some decent lacing.  S - Very hoppy, but mostly pines and maybe some citrus.  T - Mostly pines on the taste and a little citrus. Definitely gets your mouth going. Would have preferred the citrus to take over.  M - Pretty boozy after taste. Mostly the pine stuck around.  D - Overall a very good beer. An enjoyable experience and a good summer beer. Has a strong finish with a solid beginning. A great DIPA for the price",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,scottfrie,4.44,"22oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Old, but worth a shot.  A: Pours a deep amber with a thick, slightly oily tan head that slowly faded into a thin film that left a sheet of sticky lacing down the glass. S: Strong scent of citrus hops. Notes of lemon and caramel malt. T: The hops have faded a bit with this one. Notes of caramel malt, alcohol, sweet fruits, orange rind, and lemon zest. This very much tastes like a barleywine. As another reviewer put it, I guess that's what over a year and a half does to this beer. The hops lend a touch of bitterness to the finish. M: Medium syrupy-slick body with a wet finish and tingly carbonation. The alcohol is noticeable in the finish with a touch of warmth. D: I wish I hadn't waited so long to drink this one because now it really does taste like a barleywine.

345,14916,dwilson01,4.05,"poured from a 12 oz bottle into my arrogant bastard pint glass, a clear pale yellow gold body color and a creamy white white head which dissipates very slowly leaving fingers of lace all the way down the glass.  The scent gives my nostrils a refreshing crispness, like a breath of fresh air on a cool breezy morning. Definitely hop forward in scent, mostly that woody pine which comes of intense bitter hopping.  The flavor profile is solidly grounded in some straight up bitter hop tastes. Bitter pine comes in at the beginning and sticks with you throughout the whole intake on into the aftertaste. It's mostly that generic undefined bitterness that I get out of it but there are a couple other aspects. The malt is ever present and always in the background giving a bready herbed sourdough flavor to it and there is a tad of citrus although not much to speak of there. The flavor stands up very well and compliments a quite spicy meal as well, this would be a great thai red curry dinner pairing.  The mouthfeel is quite balanced I think, the hops and carbonation provide a great lightening refreshment factor while the malt is there with a thicker backbone to make this more of a sipping brew than anything else. Very drinkable although the flavor is quite potent which would definitely deter most from attempting to chug on of these.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,frognot,5,"Appearance: Pale gold with a pure white fluffy head.  Smell: Lots and lots of pine with just a wee hint of citrus. An aroma that says ""Prepare to be walloped with hops!""  Taste: Crisp, clean with the strong bitterness is buffered with the perfect touch of malt. It goes great with all kinds of food, especially something spicy (or it's good by itself).  Mouthfeel: A refreshing wake-up of hoppy goodness.  Drinkability: I have to remind myself that the ABV is 8.5%. Very drinkable but packs a punch.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Briken,4.11,Hazy golden color with big foamy off white head. A somewhat light resinous pine aroma. Huge hops upfront of pine and grapefruit with just a touch of barley sweetness. Smooth soft feel with a big bitter linger.  This is just big hoppy DIPA goodness. Not too much complexity although I did love the distinct yet subtle barley flavor that became much more apparent and pleasant as the beer warmed.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,mfunk9786,4.42,"Great hoppy beer that is one of the early-year standards for hop fans.  A: Amber, missing that overwhelmingly orange tint that a lot of DIPAs have. Beautiful though, with a white head that takes a while to dissipate.  S: Pine - sort of like sniffing a Christmas tree that you just brought home. Not my favorite incarnation of fresh hops, but not my least favorite, either. I've begun to deduce hops down to: a) juicy; fruity b) pine-y, like a christmas tree in a blender c) like citrus fruit rind in a blender, bitter and mouth-puckering. This is definitely a B. (and that's certainly not a bad thing!)  T: Tasty, with pine and grapefruit overwhelming the flavor, but it certainly gets tastebuds going. Definately a more satisfyingly hoppy brew than Victory's own Yakima Twilight, which I love as well. I began my relationship with Victory being annoyed by their love of hops, but I'm beginning to understand why they can't resist hopping their beers to an overwhelming extent - they're so good!  M: Slightly warm from booze, but mostly tingly from hop flavors and citrus rind. An overall pleasant experience.  D: Because of the dry grapefruit and lemon flavors, this is a very pleasing summer beer. I realize that it peaks in flavor in the early part of any given calendar year, when the hop harvest is fresh and fertile, but it's worth giving in a try in the May-July area, when the lighter, more lemonade-y qualities of the hops can be appreciated on a very relaxing level.  I love this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Bouleboubier,4.87,"This is what a hoppy beer should be - hops, water, beer flavor.  If you've ever taken the tour of Victory's brewery or read the details of their basic brewing practices on the website, you'll know that Victory uses whole-flower hops. Victory is a grand master at hopping beer.  Exceedingly more than any other beer I've had - this brew exudes the absolute essence of whole-flower hops (or, at least, the variety(ies) they employ in it) in every facet - aroma, flavor, even texture.  Stick your face in a sack of hop flowers and inhale (in the manner of President Skroob from the can of Perri-Air in Spaceballs) - that's the aroma. Hops, not air.  Hop Wallop reflects a sunburnt, light-gold color. The head and lacing are: sticky, cottony, gritty, lip-smacking. The oils are choice.  Tastes like liquid solid hop flowers. Soft bready backbone. Can't detect a heck of a lot of alcohol. Oh, heavens, can you gulp this with wicked fervor. Or you can simply drink it and calmly relish every nanosecond.  You like real hops? You're a fool not to try this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

M - Nicely solid and good carbonation.  D - Not bad, just too piney for me, but could probably do more than one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BlackBearForge,4.35,"Hop Wallop is a pale gold in the glass, much lighter than I would have expected with a big white head that leaves generous amounts of lacing.  The aroma is chock full of tropical fruit type hop scents including pineapple, grapefruit, oranges and lemon.  The flavor is a giant showcase of hops, pungent piney resinous and citrusy hops well supported by pale malts but all about hops nonetheless. Hop bitterness is huge but held in check. Candied grapefruit, orange, pine resin, it's like being walloped in the head with a slice of grapefruit wrapped around a pine cone. The malts keep the hop edges from being too sharp and are bready and a touch biscuity. Alcohol is nearly invisible. Warming alleviates the bitterness and the massive hops blend nicely with the lightly caramel sweet bready malts.  Mouthfeel is medium in body, firm, full and very smooth but with just a hint of roughness in the finish. Remains nicely carbonated throughout.  I was expecting a hoppy ale from Hop Wallop but was unprepared for the hop assault this beer presented. I soon recovered though as this is an excellent beer and great for savoring as the hop flavors change as the beer warms. Delicious and highly recommended, especially if you are a hop head.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

After getting sick of watching me pace around the liquor store trying to find a second choice, she picks out Hop Whallop. I went on to suggest she only picked it for the picture, to which she unabashedly agreed. When I got home and cracked one I was very pleased at how good the beer turned out to be.  The appearance is the worst part of the beer, it is a very clear golden yellow. Little head and mild lacing with above average levels of carbonation.  The beer definitely smells hoppy and not of much else. There is a mild floral sweetness to it though.  The beer is hoppy but I was actually unimpressed with the level of hoppiness given all the descriptors on the bottle. it's still very tasty and at a relatively low 8.5% (compared to most modern DIPAs) it is very drinkable.

T: The initial taste is sweet, as is the center in fact. The hops kick in just behind the center and carry through a beautify bitter finish, then come back on the palate as a hoppy resin aftertaste.  M: Full-bodied, yet balanced by the good carbonation. The alcohol is extremely well integrated.  D: The only barrier to drinking more of these wonderful DIPAs is the abv.

Smell: Piney and earthy hops are balanced by citrus hops perfectly in the nose. There is a really sweet malt backbone that is clearly apparent as well.  Taste: Balanced nicely. The big burst of pine and grapefruit is followed with an earthy goodness that is equaled by a wonderful malt back and a perfect bitter kick. For an east coast beer, this one has its toes in the west coast.  Mouthfeel: Sticky from the hops and bouncy from the carbonation with a medium body.  Drinkability: A lot of breweries tend to make their DIPA a ramped up version of their single IPA, Victory really mixed it up.

345,14916,PintOHops,3.82,"Glass - Snifter  A - Cloudy apricot or yellow/orange color, didn't produce a head at all really, just a thin ring atop the beer. As for lacing, I got a few spots here & there, but that's it.  S - Quite soft actually, I get a bit of raw hop in the way of faint or stale marijuana, or raw tobacco. Following is a really nice mango & apricot aroma, sweet but not overly so. That's really all I'm getting here, not big which is strange to me.  T - Not intense here either, I get raw hop again, but not a barrel of it, it's prominent but not huge. Raw, herbal, earthy, tobacco, following is pineapple, apricot, a bit of peach, and what I like about the fruitiness, is that it's not syrupy & overly sweet! This beer finishes with dry alcohol, not much of a burn though, and a long long lingering burnt like hop bitterness, that's pretty damn bitter.  M - Very soft crispness with a somewhat thin body, not syrupy at all, around medium in body.  D - About as drinkable as the next DIPA, if not a bit more drinkable. I loved the fact that it wasn't to sweet & fruity, and the alcohol seems to be masked well, even when warmed. I didn't think this was a huge hop bomb in the way of sticky/resin/pine like hops, maybe mine was old, but I still really liked this one, far more than the sweeter ones. I'd have another, maybe 2-snifters in a sitting, pretty good. Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,JosiahS,3.9,"Poured from a bottle into a small glass snifter. It didn't produce much head at all, just a very thin white ring and some clusters of bubbles in the middle. The color of this beer looks like a blend of Pineapple, mango and orange juices. Very cloudy as well, giving it a nice glow.  The aroma caught me off guard, it's either an intense earthyness much like a cigar or weed ..or it's some slight skunkyness. Either way, the aroma is pleasant. There are very floral hops up front that give a bit of perceived dryness and a sharp lime rind aroma.  The taste is of earthy and floral hops with some very bitter grapefruit that falls away into soft breadiness or dough that reminds me of masa, which is used for tamales. Lingering bitterness is moderate but not overwhelming. Alcohol is well inigrated.  Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied but has a lightness in the mouth. Carbonation is relatively low.  This is a nice DIPA that has an intense earthyness to it. Because the bottle did not have the printed 'best before' date on it that it was supposed to have, i'm a little confused about how to grade it. Overall it was nice and even if it is old, it's still a great beer!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

The hops have definitely faded a little but it retains its original character. It is still incredibly bitter and flavorful. However as far as taste go, for the style I have had better.

345,14916,boss302,4.42,"Victory hop wallop, draft  A The beer is golden, not crystal clear, but that is to be expected for a high hopped beer. There is a nice head that sticks for the whole glass.  S Fresh crisp smooth flowery aroma with a little sweetness. This is the best smelling beers by Victory that I've had so far. No off flavors, very clean.  T Hops dominate. Beneath the hops you can taste a definite maltiness. Not overly astringent in the aftertaste as you might be led to expect from the hop bite. There is some acidity and piney flavor.  M Highly carbonated and burns on your tongue. I would characterize as a light to medium body. There is no warming from the alcohol, and by taste I would have guessed around 5 to 6ABV instead of the 8.5ABV that Victory says. I think the hops go a long way to hide the alcohol.  O An excellent beer, highly hopped, refreshing, and right on target for the hop lover. The more timid might have a hard time with a second pint.

Head lasted for quite a while, leaving some thick lacing on the glass.  S: Big citrus and floral hops. Smells a touch grassy.  T: More hops follow on the taste. Less citrus, more floral and piney flavors. A moderate malt backbone, although I consider this slightly unbalanced towards the bitter side. Still get a grassy, almost hay like flavor on the taste. Finish is bitter with a very slight warming sensation.  M: Medium body, moderate to high carbonation. Very lively in the mouth. Nice change of pace from a lot of thick, syrupy DIPAs.  D: Very easy beer to consume.

Despite its name, this is one of the most well-balanced DIPA's that I have had.  M- Creamy mouthfeel with some carbonation.  D- Considering it is an 8.5 it is really drinkable mostly due to the creamy mouthfeel/taste and the sweet maltiness that blends well with the bitter hopiness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Hop flavor lingers everywhere it touches, lasts quite a while on the back of the tongue (5+ minutes after a few drinks).  M - Medium body, light carbonation.  D - Very drinkable for an 8.5% beer.

345,14916,cdizinno,4.29,"Presentation: Poured into a tulip glass from a growler purchased at Green's - Piney Grove in Columbia, SC.  A: A healthy white head leaves think rings of lace down the glass. Slightly hazy gold color.  S: Mild citrus and floral hops. Not as aromatic as other reviews, but I may have messed myself up by drinking a spicy Belgian just before this.  T&M: Solid medium body. Mild malty sweetness all the way through, but hops always prevail. Piney and citrus flavors are there but nothing special about the taste. The huge plus is the masking of the 8.5% ABV. Careful drinking up!  Kind of disappointing, but much better than a single bottle I purchased at Total Wine & More that had to be way out of date. It is definitely worth the cost for a DIPA ($9.99/growler!), but after tasting unique DIPA's like GUBNA, Lenny's R.I.P.A., and Boy King Double, this falls way short.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Aguirre,3.33,"Poured a bottle into a pint glass.  First impressions: I was surprised at how light this beer was, it looked like straw! The head looks good but I expected a deeper color for a DIPA.  The smell was another shocker, I didn't get any big citrus or pine hops in the nose. It smelled more like a pilsner than anything else.  I'll probably get some eye rolls for this, but the hop taste reminds me in a way of a beefed-up Sam Adams Noble Pils. I'm not sure what type of hops they used but I got that ""German"" taste, rather than the big tropical fruit/pine bomb I was expecting. It's massively bitter, but the flavor profile isn't overly complex. Again, I wasn't overly impressed with the flavor, but this beer screams with peel the paint off the way bitterness.  Mouthfeel was good for the style. Drinkability was pretty nice too, the 8.5% is well-hidden and really sneaks up on you.  Overall, this was a letdown for me. I like my DIPA's stinky with hops and this one smelled like wet hay. This was most likely a one-time buy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Very bitter but not overwhelming because of a nice sweet malty notes in the background.  M Moderate carbonation, medium bodied, and crisp with a nice bitter finish. The bitterness sticks around after each sip.  D The way it sticks around in my mouth leaves me wanting another but I could probably only have a couple before I needed to change things up.

I get the same nice balance of pine and citrus as in the aroma, but it is mixed in with some tropical fruits as well. There is also a slight malt sweetness in the background that improves it over the aroma. Very nice tasting dipa.  Medium bodied, with a nice level of carbonation.

Also a nice head, that retained very well.  S - Like almost everyone, very piny. A very little citrus hint leaks through as well.  T - Tastes almost just as it smells. Very bitter with hops. Can get a little taste of the alcohol, but this beer incorporates it nicely. Aftertaste isn't too lingering. Extremely hoppy.  M - Very ""awakening"". Extremely crisp. It kind of wakes you up with its hoppiness. Not as heavy as the abv would suggest.  D - Although I love this brew, the 8.5% abv makes it tough to enjoy more than a couple in a sitting. Even with the abv, I find this beer highly drinkable and recommend to anyone in search of a great double ipa.  Since this is my first review, any criticism and/or comments would be welcome.

Its quite good though. I'm also getting some floral hops as well...really quite nice.  M- body is a little thick, though not overwhelmingly syrupy like you can get sometimes. With the high hop character you get from this beer, you want a thick body so you're not beaten over the head with the flavor.  D- this one is a sipper.

I love bitter beer, mind you, but what I love even more is the pure, unadulterated flavor of the hop. (For another good, and not as strong, example of these, check out Sam Adams's Noble Pils.)

Sweet spicy pineapple and tangerine as well. Great combination.  Taste: The sweet malt is there for support, but I get a great sweet and bitter hop presence throughout. Pineapple, apricot, tangerine, and grapefruit together with strong pine hops gives this a great flavor. My taste buds shift from one flavor to the next, enjoying each separately and together. The finish is a little bitter, but very well tied together.  Mouthfeel: A nice creamy feel, with medium carbonation and a medium body. A bit grainy, with a slightly oily residue.

345,14916,mdwalsh,2.86,"A: Pale golden, lots of active carbonation, large slightly yellow head. Big, but good texture.  S: No likey. Too much hops with too little malt leaves this beer overly dank and a little skunky, even with excellent care. It smells like, well, too me, bad weed. It smells like the weed that people who don't smoke weed point to when they're trying to make a point that it smells bad and is yucky. Sorry, I just don't like it.  T: On first sip, it's a little better, a little more of a grapefruit taste, but not really much to make it worth while. I get more of a true hop taste than I do aroma, but still. It's really more of a hop tea than a beer, and what I fear in an IPA. This should never be a person's first craft beer, hate to say. Totally unbalanced. But, 8.5% abv? really? that's actually pretty damn good. Dry, forward, and unattractive as far as I'm concerned. I give it an average because the small part of me that loves a hoppy beer says it's impressive to pack that much into a glass, and that much ABV with so little else.  M: Nothing to remember here, that's for sure. It was there, and then it isn't. Very BMC in this regard. I want a LOT more texture from a beer like this. Hop Tea.  D: Does never again sum it up?

A: Pours a bright golden yellow...goldenrod? Yeah let's go with goldenrod. Anyway, this beer is beautiful. Slightly hazy. Ivory head that clings to the glass with the best of 'em.  S: Grassy, herbal, almost medicinal hop aroma. Noting some bready, biscuit-like aromas as the beer warms.  T: Pale malt followed by glorious hops. Grassiness is present, but more pronounced are the citrus flavors. Lemon zest, juicy mandarin orange and some tart grapefruit. Herbal notes make an apperance. Not a palate wrecker, but there is a heavy dose of bitterness.  M: Nice body. Carbonation is spritzy but never too much. Slighty creamy feel. Solid in this department.  D: Good. 8.5% is pretty big, but aside from that there is nothing about this beer that wouldn't make me want another. It has dissapeared from my glass quickly, so I'll say it was quite drinkable.  Another good one from Victory. This is one of those beers that is so readily available that I don't appreciate it as much as it deserves. As I fall further into Beer Geek-dom I sometimes have to remind myself that there are world class beers right in my back yard...this is one of them. Victory is great across the board, but Hop Wallop and Prima Pils are in rarified air. Grab one of these if you have the chance or trade for some if you have to, but definitely give it a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,GDBEERMAN,3.8,"Poured into a pint glass A: Poured a very light yellow color. A bit light for DIPA. Short head retention and minimal lacing.  S: The aroma is that of a hoppy beer, but I was expecting more. Good none the less.  T:The Taste was the best part of the beer. A rich hop profile. Very impressed with this east coast IPA, I tend to prefer the West Coast. This one is a good sipping beer, but at the same time a good one for a session in the sun.  M: Short and sweet, well bitter. The bitterness is released on the off tastes. You can clearly taste this beer on the palate ten minutes after drinking.  D: The ABV is hidden very well in this beer, I would pick this one up, due to the hidden bit alone. Smooth and refreshing.  Notes: Great Beer, another one that did not disappoint from Victory. Very comparable to other DIPAs and IPAs but a truly unique beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,david18,4.1,"This is one of my favorite east coast double IPA's and I think I like the draft a little better than the bottle.  It has a very good carmel color and intense pine aroma. The flavor is a little ""sticky"" and the alcohol is a bit too present but in general this is one to get, particularly if you haven't tried it before.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Good lacing.  S: Smelled of hops, citrus, and a touch of malt.  T: Taste consisted of citrus (a little grapefruit perhaps, spicy hops in the finish, an earthy quality, and some malt. A solid, lively, fresh taste.  M: A good amount of carbonation with a slightly slick finish. Medium-bodied.  D: While there are more dynamic Imperial IPAs out there, this one is definitely one of the most drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,crossovert,3.49,"12 oz bottle, no freshness date./  It pours a clear deep gold with a rocky white head.  The smell is not up to par for the DIPA, I hope the bottle isn't old. It is tropical and more tropical, not really the best smelling DIPA.  The taste redeems it a bit. It is just a clean unoffensive, fairly bitter DIPA. The taste is more piney, the tropical flavor is left behind. The aftertaste is of grapefruit.  The drinkability is up there, it goes down like nothing.  Overall it is decent but well over hyped.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,IronLover,3.97,"Deep yellow color with a slight haze. Firm head with good retention and light lacings. Very floral, complex aroma. Nice full-body feel with an explosion of hop flavor that tapered into a light finish but strong hop aftertaste. Excellent carbonation that makes this very hoppy ale refreshing and drinkable. The taste is overwhelmed by hops and not as complex as the aromas that you start with.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Kallessin,4.25,"Pours a golden straw color, mostly clear with lazy bubbles floating throughout. Has a foamy cream colored head with very nice lacing on the glass that settles to a persistent thin film.  Has a strong grassy/pine hop aroma with a some grapefruit. There's also some toasted malt with a subtle sweetness underneath. The mix of strong hops and subtle malt give it a little candy like quality.  Much like the aroma, it has a strong woody/pine flavor with some grapefruit and other light citrus flavors - mostly lemon. It's also fairly peppery. Under that are layers of toasted malt. It's very bitter but not harsh and the hop flavor really comes through. The alcohol is hidden very well.  It's medium to full bodied with prickly carbonation, some oiliness. It's very dry, but not harsh.  I really enjoyed this beer. I found the hops very flavorful and not overwhelmed by bitterness. The malt stayed in the background where it should go, but was present in every sip nonetheless.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,lawman834,3.58,"A hazy golden color. Nice head that sticks around. Thick lacing all the way down. Smells mostly of citrus with hoppiness. Taste is citrus and quite floral with a massive hop bite. There is a smooth hint of malt under it all but it is mostly hidden and only on the finish. With that hop bite and the high ABV, this one is a sipper. A little more one sided than I like, but impressive none the less.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,HalfFull,2.96,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a large wine glass, a now preferred vessel for DIPA's. A rigorous pour yields a golden straw color with half an inch of white foam. Moderate retention and light lacing follow. Oddly light in color.  Nose is light with a bit of citrus and grassy hay. Imperial IPA? IPA?? Does expand to offer a richer citrus component with some warming, along with a subtle malt backbone, but remains thin for the style. Rather lemony and sweet with agitation.  Flavor is thin and watery with a citric close. Finish is slightly bitter yet offers little depth and grain texture. Becomes overly sweet in the end, particularly given its lack of depth and texture. Viscous orange oil in feel.  Overall the brew is thin, citrusy and light in body, yet it's fairly drinkable if you can accept the limoncello aspect of it all. Overall to me it's quite hollow and lacking, yet not offensive.  Best by Jan. 2011 on bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,MrSnrub,2.2,"I had high hopes for this beer: it's my favorite style, it's plentiful and relatively inexpensive in my area, it has excellent reviews on BA, and it's got a cool name. I thought this might become a go-to beer for me.  What a disappointment! It sure didn't look like an IPA, its pale yellow color more befitting a pilsner. It didn't smell like an IPA, either - more like straw. Its taste resembled that of a failed IPA: quite bitter, but with hardly any hop flavor or malt presence. Had you told me I was drinking some kind of bitter macro lager I would have believed you.  I'm honestly baffled by other reviews that describe this beer as hoppy, flavorful, etc. Could I have simply gotten a bad bottle? Seems improbable, as there are several other reviews that describe what I encountered. Nonetheless, I hold out hope that I'll be able to edit my review next time I try this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,drtth,4.33,"Poured into Sam Smith imperial pint glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: As poured the beer is a slightly hazed light straw color with a 1"" thick fluffy off-white head that persists for a while but eventually recedes to a ring of foam around the glass with a patch of irregular foam in the middle. Sipping leaves lots of irregular lacing and the foam clings to the sides of the glass in rings and irregular patches with no particular pattern.  Smell: The Aroma is citric hops all the way but they are backed up by some pine and some tropical character and a hint of malt.  Taste: The flavors are much the same as you would expect from the nose. The grapefruit citric bitterness dominates, there is a definitie touch of pine and there are tropical fruits in the background. The balancing effect of the barely detectable malt backbone prevent the tongue rasping that some DIPAS provide. Very hard to pick up any alcohol.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium bodied with a nice prickly feel from the active carbonation. The finish is long and ranges through from the full citric/pine/tropical favor to a hint of sweetness before it tapers off in a long dry bitterness that leaves the mouth wanting more.  Drinkability: I think the drinkability here is very high. Over the course of the beer I kept sipping away and wished there was more in the glass when I finished it. I could easily have had a second and I'm sure I will be having more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Beer is a golden straw color with a decent head to start. After receding, leaves behind minimal spots of lacing. Beer is a bit cloudy with very light activity  S- Despite the fact that it was a winter release and its now mid April, still has a very nice hop aroma  T- Like the smell, the few months sitting seems to not have effected the taste... or else this is an absolutely amazing beer when it's fresh. Has a very subtle maltiness to it with a very nice hoppy bite that really kicks in about mid swig and lingers long after swallowing  M- Lighter in body and carbonation with a great hoppy mouthfeel  D- Very...

A little malt, but primarily hops  T: Grapefruit and sweet floral hop presence at first, followed by pine and lemon zest. Subtle banana and pineapple notes are present as well. A little bit of maltiness, but mostly hops and bitterness. Finishes dry and bitter  M: Medium bodied, well carbonated, and very smooth. Almost no alcohol presence.  D: Incredibly easy to drink for the abv, but very bitter. I could definitely have a few of these, but i know they would start to creep up on me after a second or third  Overall, this is a very good DIPA. Very well balanced, mostly hops but with a little maltiness to keep it from being overwhelming.

345,14916,ScarletLady,3.65,On tap served in a pint glass A - medium gold with lots of active carbonation. Minimal head and thin lacing  S- a little disappointing in the nose. I expected much more. Couldn't detect much of anything but maybe it's just the allergies  T - now we're talkin! soapy and nicely bitter without being too much which lingers between sips. Small amt of citrus  M - light with good carbonation esp for a beer this big  D - good but because the flavor was so bitter I would only drink one in a sitting,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

S: a dusty, earthy hop aroma(pine, grapefruit), bananas, honeyed, white-bread aromas  T: more earthy hoppiness upfront, dusty and fruity. a slight caramel sweetness follows a bitter and dry piney, grapefruit peel flavor.  M: a medium body with a velvety entry and lush carbonation. quickly bittering and finishes resiny and dry.  Overall, this beer has some great fresh hop qualities for an IPA with such a high abv. Most double IPAs increase the alcohol of an IPA, which in turn increases the malt presence. I could hardly notice the 8.5 percent abv due to the earthy hops. However, not as much of a wallop of hoppiness as it was a well-rounded hoppiness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Fades relatively quickly to leave a continuous white lace around the glass.  American hop variertys provide the typical citrusy hop aromas as well as some flowery notes. Trying to detect other notes, maybe a bit from the malt but really the hops are just too strong.  On the palate its the flowery and citrus hop flavors along with a strong bittering hop note. Again, the malt its trying to break through but this really is a hop wallop.  Smoothed and polished feel in the mouth with a decent carbonation. Rather light bodied compared to other D.I.P.A.s",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jmerloni,3.8,"A - The color is a clear golden yellow with huge bubbly light head that condenses and gets pillowy as it recedes. Retention is impressive and the lacing is very extreme.  S - Oh lord, HOPS! Wow! This is a true wallop as the name suggests. Also a lot of pine and citrus in there.  T - A classic imperial IPA with some unique flavors that aren't detectable on the nose. There is citrus and piney hops in addition to a unique pineapple taste and some banana. Things are a bit skunky though...I don't really know what to make of this.  M - Good overall. Not a great finish - the hops are a bit musty - and it is not as crisp as it could be... but it is well carbonated and extraordinarily well hopped.  D - This is a good brew overall and the drinkability is perhaps better than a lot of imperial IPAs because of how well it is hopped. The ABV is still pretty high and you can only drink a couple. Don't know if I would ever buy a whole 6 of this. I like the regular HopDevil IPA from Victory more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Not in a bad way or anything. Mouthfeel is a bit tacky, creamy. Tastes full on pine-a-licous. I didn't look at the hop content, but it seems as though there are no noble hops present. However, on the bittering end, it's a hop-bomb. I'm loving this beer. But I better stop at 2.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Mancer,4.72,"I think the best way to start this review is with a ""WOW!"" I am absolutely blown away by this beer. Poured into a pint glass, a golden amber. The head had decent retention and initially poured 3 fingers high and stuck around for a few minutes before dissipating. There was also a nice amount of lacing that stuck to the glass once the beer was finished off. I'm not 100% sure what it was that was floating in the beer, possibly finely ground rinds? The smell of this beer was exceptional; I could successfully pick off citrus hops and pine. The initial taste of this beer was that of citrus hops and pine. This progressed to a hint of grapefruit and possibly some lemon. The finale was a pleasant bitterness which left me with a need to drink the experience again. This beer has a medium body and for me, any type of IPA is a sipping beer, not something I could down in an instant, nor would I want to.  My final thoughts for this beer is that Victory is spot on with this brew, it is fantastic and in my personal top 3 beers. I will definitely be buying this again , regardless of its price. V for Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Sam21,4.32,"12 oz Bottle into tulip.  Appearance - Healthy head that sticks around. Nice glass stickage.  Smell - Pine, pineapple, grapefruit, and orange. BIG citrus hop character, some grassy leafy goodness, and little else.  Taste - Taste to match. Big citrus kick! Loads of delicious fresh hop flavor. Residual bitterness is not overwhelming at all.  Mouth Feel - Full bodied and sticky, but not overwhelmingly so. Good carbonation, dry finish.  Drinkability - Very easy to drink, alcohol is hidden well so it could definitely sneak up on you. It reminds me a lot of Smuttynose IPA with the huge citrus hop kick, but the lingering bitterness in Hop Wallop is more citrusy than bitter. Fantastically hopped up beer!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,urwithdave,3.5,"Reviewing from notes. Served on tap at World of Beer. Poured into a standard pint glass.  A- Pours golden/bronze in color. Very little, almost no head although this may have been because the pint was not beer clean. A thin ring was all that was present around the inside diameter of my pint.  S- Big piney hops presence with some grapefruit in the distance. Not really getting anything other than this.  T- Very bitter. The bitterness runs the show here and is in charge. A hint of citrus, although, I can not pinpoint what exactly. No malt presence detected. I love hop forward brews, but this is so bitter, I don't even really get much besides the bitterness.  M- Medium bodied with a lingering bitterness.  D- One was enough fo sure! Did I mention this one was bitter?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

S: Citrus hops and pine needles with bold assertions of ruby red grapefruit and orange peel rind.  T: Taste packs a hoppy wallop and parallels the aromatics: big hits of citrus hops and pine resin upfront, followed by blasts of grapefruit pith and orange rind. Finishes with an intense bitterness and a smack of salt that wipes out all previous taste memories. Extreme to be sure, but never overpowering.  M: Creamy mouthfeel with a bit of a prickling quality. Slick hop oil coats the palate.  D: Hoppiness is happiness, but more than two bottles of Wallop is pushing it for this self-proclaimed HopHead.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

It took me a while to begin to really enjoy hoppy beer, and now that i do this is definitely one of my favorites.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,DoreenAndDave,4.42,"A light golden beer with very little head. Aroma is intense, resinous hops with a touch of bread or yeast. Taste is a dense wall of hops. Lots and lots of substantial hops, with some grapefruit and bread. It's pleasantly bitter, but not bracingly dry the way some extreme ipas can be. Mouthfeel is good. The beer is quite drinkable. Big powerful hops. Smooth and assertive, but not edgy. Very impressive.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Very peppery and spicy, with strong grapefruit citrus and some pine. Above average sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a strong hop bite. Little bit of alcohol tinglieness at the back of your throat.  Drinkability: It is quite a ""wallop"" of hops. Very flavorful grapefruit hops, with a strong bite. Not overly harsh, but a little on the syrupy sweet side. A little one dimensional and not that complex, but very good. A good one to try if you like hops.  Buy Again? Yes.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Lerxst,4.35,"Victory is finally available in my area!!! Finally get to try the famed Hop Wallop. Here goes...  A-Pours a cloudy gold with a billowy white head that hangs around a bit and leaves nice lacing.  S-Nose isn't as prominent as I thought it would be, but its nice. Floral & citrus hops are most prominent with faint malt notes in the background.  T-Here is where the hops shine. Bitter, piney, resiny hops hit me first with some floral and citrus hops lingering. Just a trace of malt in there too. This is a beer for hop heads, no doubt. Its really good.  M-Medium bodied, carb level is lower than anticipated and works really well with this beer. The bitterness bites at the tongue nicely. A finish that is somehow both sticky and a bit oily makes it very interesting.  D-This is a DIPA that goes down so easily it can be dangerous.

The bitter flavors are the biggest, followed by a lighter amount of hop and malt flavors.  The body is crisp and light and very lager-like.  This is an interesting double IPA: It's all about the bitterness, with hop and malt flavors coming in far behind.

345,14916,SpeedwayJim,3.96,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle labeled with a 'drink by' date of Nov. 24, 2010, into a tulip.  A: Standard pour yields a steadily rising 2 finger semi-coarse white head excellent retention. Beer is a clear golden orange. Lacing's got great stick and forms a weblike pattern, literally covering the glass like an elaborate, frothy art piece.  S: The hiss of the opening of the bottle produces a nose-full of hoppy citrus notes, but strangely when I pour this into my glass and swirl it around, I can barely detect anything. Slight citrus and sugar cookie if I try real hard but not much else here. Also a bit of plastic in there. As this warms, a bit of cream and sugar cane come through.  T: Citrus, piney, and astringent hops smack me around immediately but the extremely subtle malt backbone quickly tend to my wounds. Bready and doughy in the middle. Astringent hops work their way back though to once again eclipse everything else. Evens out towards the end as the hoppiness ends in a viscious bite, leaving their mark in the huge aftertaste.  M: Medium bodied, coarse and carbonated. Surprisingly smooth in the mouth at the same time. This one is really warming which I appreciate. Finish is messy as hell, leaving a huge trail of hoppiness long after the brew's gone.  D: This one, like most of Victory's brews, this is not for the faint of heart. However, unlike their other beers, I really appreciate this one. Great feel and hop complexity that I don't get from most other IPA's.

345,14916,Jeffo,4.41,"Moms and pops grabbed this the last time they were down in Pennsylvania. Thanks guys.  From a bottle into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a fluffy two finger medium white head with great retention. Higher levels of carbonation evident. Color is a bright golden poppy yellow or amber yellow. A unique and beautiful bright color; much lighter and more yellow than others in the style. Head slowly recedes to a nice foam cap and leaves lots of immediate lacing. A good foam cap stays until the end and leaves lots of fantastic lacing down the glass. Beauty.  SMELL: Lots of hops in the nose. Mango, pineapple, and touches of bitter grapefruit. A very fruity melon-like hop profile. Some pale malts make their way through as well, though it's more about the bursting hops.  TASTE: Very tasty. Some pale malts soon give way to mango and melon hops, including some pineapple as well. Quite fruity again. This is followed by a dose of bitterness; pine notes mostly, which wasn't advertised in the nose. With some spiciness from the alcohol. Aftertaste is strong and long lasting, with lots of bitter hops and touches of spicy alcohol. A touch of malt sweetness at the finish lends some nice balance to this one.  PALATE: Bigger, thicker body with medium carbonation. Much different than I had expected from the look. Very creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly mouth coating with a slight alcohol bite at the end, which was the only thing keeping it from a perfect score here.  OVERALL: I managed to get this down on the last day of the best before date, and it blew me out of the water. Great beer all around. Everything about this beer was fantastic, with only the slightly overdone alcohol presence holding it back a bit. This is one I'll definitely be trying to find fresh the next time I get across the border. Highly recommend this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,NittanyBeerFan,3.65,"A: Bubbles forced into the beer cascade upwards, swirling and dancing as they form a creamy 1/2-finger head. The body is light copper with some amber hues. This is much lighter and less orange than what I envision when I think of a DIPA. The lacing is phenomenal.  S: Grapefruity undertones highlight a big grassy hop presence. Bitterness seems a bit subdued. Not much going on aside from the hoppy flavors mentioned before. Even so, I enjoy the hop-leaning aspect of this aroma.  T: There is a huge presence of grassy and some piney hops, and they are nicely complemented by hints of citrus. Distinctly German malts reign in the hop bitterness and really balance this one out. Maybe a little bit disappointing, since Victory's Hop Devil is such a hop masterpiece. It is just a bit too balanced for a Double IPA. However, I would never believe that this is an 8.5% beer.  M/D: Incredibly smooth and easy drinking, but it lacks a big resinous hop feel. It is dangerously drinkable. The bitterness could be more accentuated, as I said before. Otherwise, very enjoyable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,gthornton,3.78,"There is no born on date, so it may be difficult to tell how accurately I am tasting this beer. There is plenty of hop character here to handle a bit of loss from age though.  Any homebrewers here? Take a hop pellet or two and pop it in your mouth, you practically have a hop wallop. Huge, bitter hop nose and taste. Pretty awesome. Fresh cut grass, citrus, etc...  A typical golden, haystack, translucence that is common with these strongly hopped beers, as to keep a simple malt bill, and allow the hops to shine... a la Pliny the Younger.  As for drinkability this is a tasty and fun brew, but I myself won't go much more than 2-3 of these, and I love the idea of a beer that tastes like hops in my mouth... although I can feel my mouth going numb here!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,EbPhrygian,4.05,"This is my first BeerAdvocate review.  Fresh 12-oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy but rich amber with a one-finger off-white head that dissipates rather quickly. Also, the thick lacing that I've observed with a DIPA such as Dogfish Head 90 minute is only minimally evident.  Smell: Nothing overwhelming here, but distinct floral, pine, and citrus notes that are to be expected from the style.  Taste: The hoppiest beer I've had, I can only liken it to Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA except that it is more complex and full-bodied. Would definitely fall squarely into the ""bitter category"" for a DIPA (as opposed to ""sweeter"" examples).  Mouthfeel: Wow, the bitter hoppy taste really lingers on the tastebuds for quite a while!  Drinkability: Could drink another right away, no problem, although the ABV and Victory's concerted effort to exemplify the most extreme of ""hoppy"" beers limit its sessionability.  Notes: Will be interesting to compare to the [suppsedly] more subdued HopDevil by Victory, and ranks high in my [so far] limited experience with DIPAs.

Color is a nice looking, clear amber/ orange.  S - Not a very strong aroma. Some sweet malts come through, along with some citric hops and a little alcohol toward the back end of the palate.  T - Quick hit of sweet malts, then some heavy citric hops overwhelm the palate, mostly with grapefruit tastes. More sweet/ honey flavored malts get stronger about mid palate.  M - Medium to full bodied, lower in carbonation. Makes a good mouthfeel for me for a DIPA. Prickly across the tongue from the hops, dry finish from the alcohol, but still a bit sticky.

Hints of cat pee while the beer is still cold but these are faint and disappear quickly (and don't seem very out of place to begin with).  T- Hop forward- this is truly a hop lover's beer. More pine in the taste than the smell, but still mostly floral hop flavors. There are touches of graham cracker, but the malt doesn't do a lot to balance the beer.  M- Stingingly bitter, especially on the sides of my mouth. There's also a bit of alcohol burn in the very back recesses of my throat.  O- This certainly lives up to it's name.

A - Pours a cloudy pale yellow color.. a little lighter than a lot of double ipa's.. i poured into a tulip glass quite agressively and only produced a modest head but pretty good lacing.  S - smells pretty good.. like a decent dipa.. not too heavy.. fruity and floral hop smelling.. not a very strong intense smell but the smell is there and is pretty good..  T & M - surprisingly better than i would've thought. i'm glad i tried this one i may give it another shot at some point as it is right near me.. the taste is not over the top i probably prefer a bit more hoppiness but it's not fair i'm thinking of a PTE or hopslam.. i'm glad this is available around here although it's only seasonal.. i want to try the hop devil but i'm afraid that may not be hoppy enough for me.. this is good; however, does feel just a tad thin but i won't complain too much... the hoppy taste almost reminds me of a leatherlips ipa.. the same kind of hoppiness...  D - This is where i would give this higher points. because it is not so intense and a decent abv for a dipa i rate it higher here.. i could drink a couple of these no problem.. i'm glad i tried this.. the more i'm drinking it the more i'm liking it.. maybe as it warms it just gets better...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

S- Floral and earthy hops, grainy but with some citrus and other fruit  T- Bold and bitter, not much in the way of a malt to balance  M- medium body, lots of carbonation  D- Packs a punch of hops and leaves a long bitter aftertaste",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,bosox941827,3.85,"12 oz bottle into imperial pint glass.  A - Quite a light orange, much lighter than expected and quite cloudy due to being unfiltered. If not hazy, but clear instead, might be the color of a dark (quality) pils.... S - Some hops on the nose, especially right off the pour, but malty sweetness takes over after head dissipates. T & M - Very interesting. Victory's website doesn't say what hops are used in this beer, but that pils color I indicate above may be indicative, as to me, this tastes like a very strong European pils (Urquell?), particularly on the finish. There is a substantive amount of malt here of course, but b/c of lack of roasted malts (explaining the lighter color) the malt *flavor* is less prominent than in other Imperial IPAs I've had, and the hops more prominent. Alcohol raises its end only at the very end of the palate, especially after warming up. Dry hoppiness lingers on the tongue for a *long* time. Carbonation is right on for the style - nice and low. D - Very. 'Nuff said.  This is a great effort from Victory, who usually makes a great product.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,QuentinCompson,2.74,"22 oz brown bottle from Village Market in SF Ferry Bldg, chilled in fridge @ home for about an hour.  Before getting to review, would like to say I love hops, love Imperial IPAs, so I was looking forward to trying this one. Split the bottle w/ a friend, and we both were a bit puzzled. I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle or what, but my impression is quite different from the other reviews I'm seeing here. Maybe it has to do w/ the bottles journey to the West Coast, perhaps temperature change over the journey, etc.  A - Nice 2.5 finger head, fairly quick dissipation, into a slight film; crystal clear, golden pilsner look, a bit flat looking, see-through, slight bubbles  S - Skunky, almost like green bottle skunk, not really getting tons of hops in the aroma which I was expecting... Skunky, minimal hop aroma.  T-M - Yowks. Either this has a really strange hop profile or it takes a while to warm to. Not terrible, but a bit like skunk piss, with a bit of a rubber tire burn out @ the finish. Much like the aroma, just skunky. I just was not getting a fresh hop flavor here. There were definitely hops, but the skunk was more pronounced. Freshness date was 2011 also, so it couldnt have been sitting that long? Mouthfeel was fine, slight carb, nothing that stands out that much. I will say the alcohol is well hidden in all of this.  D - Neither of us wanted another. I think it was just a bad bottle from what else I am seeing here. Will try it again at another time, from a different vendor. Will update this if so...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,zoso1967,4.64,"Pours a pale golden color with a bright white frothy head and ridiculous lacing. Nose is heavy on grapefruit with some pine and malt sweetness, bit really the intense grapefruit citrus smells dominate. The taste is once again dominated by huge ruby red grapefruity hop flavor that plays well with the malt sweetness of this 8.5 ABV double. The malt is very carmely and holds up well against a substantial bitterness. Other flavors include pine, pepper and dank herbal notes. On the heavier side of medium bodied with a finish that is both sticky from the sugar, yet dry from the hops. The mouthfeel is not this beers best point, but it is not a detriment either. Drinkability is fairly good for a beer of this size, and for a grapefruity hop lover like me it is all too drinkable. One of my all time favorites and a great, and somewhat different (German malts) take on a style that is everywhere. I had a half barrel of this beer at my wedding. The crazy thing is, as great as this is, it's even better on cask.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ktrillionaire,4.35,"A - It pours a golden hue, very translucent, nice head and lace. The packaging is funny; Victory&#8217;s beer labels almost all resemble the kitschy graphics of the TV show Futurama.  S - The aroma, as with nearly every Victory product, is an aroma colored with something German. A lot of hoppy goodness, mostly in the herbal/dank/resiny palate range.  T - This is very delicious and features a well balanced hop profile. The malt base is very Germanic in flavor, like a pilsener. The hop starts with a cedar-piney crispness, segueing into a general bitterness, and finishing with a decidedly Bavarian hoppiness.  M - The feel is crisp and clean, with a nice bite to it.  D - Probably my favorite Victory offering thus far, and one of the better hop-centric beers I&#8217;ve had in a while.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Wildman,4.15,"This beer not as easy to find here due to the distributor, but always glad on the rare occasion I find it. This beer poured a clear golden color and formed a large foamy off white head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. A large amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, citrus, pine, caramel and pepper. The flavor was of hops, citrus, caramel and pepper. The body was medium light while the finish was slightly astringent yet sweet. A little sweeter than I like my IPAs, but still a very good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,TheSevenDuffs,4.05,A - a cloudy yellow colour with a hint of orange and a small amount of white foamy head.  S - Lots of citrus and earthy hop presence.  T - Very hoppy and obviously somewhat bitter (expected for a DIPA). Grapefruit and pine.  M - Medium body; somewhat chewy.  D - The ABV became more and more apparent as I got closer to the bottom of my glass. Still an enjoyable beer for an 8.5% ABV.  A very good DIPA. I would definitely buy this again.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,goldbot,4.12,"12 oz bottle; best by Nov. 2010.  Pours a straw yellow and slightly hazy with thick, white frothy head which stays consistently thick. Some carbonation, lots of lacing.  Planty and grassy aromas, with an even mix of grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. A nice fresh hop aroma without being overpowering. There is also a small, doughy malt aroma which is just noticeable.  A very bitter taste, but lacking in a lot of the aromatic hoppiness. some floral notes with even less citrus. Malt is there as well but hidden behind the huge hop bitterness.  Big body from the bitterness with a sticky hop feel. The carbonation creates an airy, slightly biting feel on the tongue.  Overall a great DIPA in my opinion. Plenty of bitterness and hop presence. I only would have liked to see more of the hop aromatics carry over to the flavor, which I think would have made this a truly world class beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Two fingers of soft white head which leaves moderate lacing down the glass...  Smells like corn? Unimpressive muted aromas, some yeasty esters...  More bitter than expected, grassy, pine...some sweet bready malt pokes out at the end but the beer is really dominated by the hops...  Medium bodied, a bit chewy, well carbonated...decent mouthfeel...

345,14916,joemeister,4.28,"Pours a darker, golden yellow. Almost like a bronze. Head is about 1 inch, spongy foam with some lacing.  In a word, the smell is hops. Spicy pine and pine sap overtones. This beer seems purpose-built, as the name suggests.  Wow. These hops are not screwing around. No real fruit in the profile; this offers much more of a floral/pine taste. The bitterness is robust, and the finish gives just a subtle hint of sweetness, but if you're not paying attention it easily goes unnoticed. Body is medium-thin weight, with moderate carbonation. The glass now shows substantial lace/head rings.  Overall, this is a very hoppy beer. I would offer this to any hophead and expect them to be well-satisfied, as I am now. If you don't like this, you don't like hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,hopsbreath,3.82,"Big on hops, sweet taste and smell, low on the citrus with more of a piney resin, slightly thin mouthfeel, long lingering bitter finish. Seems a little light to be considered a DIPA. I was not crazy about this one but to be fair I have been drinking a lot of DIPA's lately and this bottle is a few months old.

345,14916,MURF0320,3.4,"Golden and slightly hazy, one finger of pretty white foam, no lacing. Smell is definitely dominated by citrus hops, but a bit weak and also smelled like it had been sitting out for awhile. Taste of bitter citrus, slightly metallic, sweet malt backbone, and noticeable alcohol. Malt begins to overcome hops as it warms. Mouthfeel is nice. Medium bodied, smooth, with a decent amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good. Not too heavy or overpowering. Even though the alcohol is detectable its still not bad for 8.5%.

345,14916,Mistofminn,4,"I can't really read the print on the bottle, but from what I can tell, the best by date is in Oct, but I can't see the year. Could be 09 or 10, but doesn't matter I'm drinking it either way.  Poured into a pint glass, golden in color with a lightish copper tint. Surprisingly clear. About two fingers of off-white head sit atop the beer, with decent retention and leave a little bit of lacing.  The nose is pretty hoppy. I get citrus and floral hops along with some grassy hops as well. A solid malt backbone is fairly assertive, which makes me lean toward thinking this is an 09 bottle.  Tastes much more bitter than the nose would lead on. The citrus and floral hops are gone, replaced by earthy and piney hops, with a resiny bitterness lingering throughout the duration of the brew. Alcohol doesn't come out much, maybe a little as it warms but it's nicely hidden.  Mouthfeel is medium in body, with a light carbonation and little to no alcohol burn. Lingering bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is pretty good on this one.

Decent amount of head, not much lacing. The smell is hops, and a a bitter musty smell that is present a bit in Victory's Prima Pils too. The smell works much better in the pilsner than it does in this IIPA. The distinct bitter mustiness that seems present in Victory beers just doesnt work for me in an IIPA. The hop presence is good, but the skunky musty taste detracts a ton. The mouthfeel is good, not too thick, but has some substance. The taste and strength of taste makes me think the drinkability is pretty poor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ugaterrapin,3.36,Pours a pale slightly hazy golden color and leaves about a finger and a half worth of head. As the foam recedes it leaves some great lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is very pronounced. It has sharp earthy citrus smell that almost burns the nostrils. The taste definitely matches the strength of the aroma. There are strong notes of pine and less citrus then the nose. It is very harsh. It has a rugged raw taste. The hop bitterness is present throughout the sip. There is not much of a malt presence to balance the bitterness of the hops. This isn't my favorite IIPA. It quite different then most of the IIPAs I have had. A slight let down from Victory since I am a big fan of almost all of their beers. Overall a good way to describe it would be raw.

T - wallop is right...big bold bitterness, really bites at the tongue with a sharp piney attack. not much character here. just about zero malt for balance...its been awhile since i've had this beer and i dont remember it, but i have a feeling this bottle might be a bit off? the best by date is ripped but still in 2010. its not awful, but just a bitter bomb without many real flavors and no balance.

345,14916,malty,4.15,"12 oz. long neck with 'Enjoy by: Jul02'10' stamped on front label.  Pours a hazy golden straw color with micro-suspended yeasty goodness visible. A white head sits quiety at 1/4"". Barely an uprising carbonation visible. Dripping rings of smattered lace all the way down my chalice.  Musty & earthy hoppiness permiates the nostrils while the sweet malt backdrop is apparent. It has that 'West Coast' hop scent that reminds me of Pliney and Green Flash, but I'm not very sure of the hop variety used. I guess I could research now, but I'd rather get to drinking it.  Definitely more bitter and rindy, falling in line with the initial scent I percieved. Rustic and bitter, not at all sweet & syrupy. The malts do support the hops showcase, but do it very delicately. A little bit of new leather taste is in there, which is very uncommon for a DIPA. Very bitter and somewhat chalky. The back of my tongue is a bit fuzzy feeling from the hop onslaught.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice oily yet dry feeling. Zippy, dry finish.  Drinkability is very good. I do appreciate the dryness of this ale, but you must appreciate the style or it could be too much for some.  Overall a fine example of the crazed DIPA style. I've seen this around for years but it's the first time I've ever tried it. Coming from Bell's & Founders territory, I hold a high bar for this style. I can say this one does the trick in it's own 'rustic' kinda way.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

I pour it high into pint glass to get an inch head, which settles fairly fast leaving persistent gummy lace. Haze in gold shows fine bubbles rising in hop fog: beauty!  Smell floral hops makes me eager to drink, tho I could sniff this all day. Taste excellent malt hop balance, with resinous hop aftertaste, all about hops. Mouthfeel perfect zingy carbonation sparkle with hop oiling the works. Drinkability is limited only by my budget.

T - A smack to the face of a bold malt backbone with a bit of caramel sweetness overwhelmed by massive pine and grapefruit hops with a dry bitter and resiny finish.  M - Hop Wallop is rather smooth and medium-bodied with a lightly dry but harshly bitter finish. Nice and refreshing.

A finger and a half of thick rich and creamy head that hangs around forever.  Smell, is piney and a touch of floral. A touch of malt sweetness also.  Taste is close to the same as he bottle version but more bitterness is present. Same, piney floral hoppiness and touch of caramel.  Mouthfeel is incredible. Are all cask beers this creamy and rich?  Drinkability is great. I paired this with the Jerk chicken grinder and it went very well.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,SpdKilz,3.95,"Appearance - Pours a relatively clear amber color with two fluffy fingers worth of head that dissipate rather quickly, leaving behind thick, chunky lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell - Citrus and hops are smelled on the forefront, followed by lighter malts and grain. The more I smell it the less citrus I smell.  Taste - Interesting. There is an immediate hit of bitterness which is almost instantly washed away with a sweet malty flavor. The more I sip it I begin to taste hints of pine and bitter grapefruit. Overall I get a heavy taste of bitter hops followed by the sweet malty backbone which then ends with a slight peppery bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, decent carbonation, a bit dry at the end. I would have expected this to be a bit fuller in body.  Drinkability - Relatively so. I have, in the past, often overlooked East Coast D/IPA's because I find many of them too sweet (90 min for example). This one is a bit more balanced - not overly sweet as I might have expected, but also not on par with many of the other West Coast D/IPA's I have available to me right now.

345,14916,FeDUBBELFIST,4.37,"From bottle to pint glass. Did not realize when I poured it that this brew is a DIPA. (Label says 'A Very Hoppy Ale'). After some schooling in the forums, I now have to agree. Next pour will be in a snifter or wine glass to see if there is any noticeable difference. Bottle says 'Enjoy by November 9, 2010. Fun label.  A: Pours with an enormous 3.5/4 finger head, off-white, frothy and filled with air. After lasting a long time, the head collapses leaving chunky patches and matching lace. Clear golden body.  S: Light sweet pale malts, cereal and grain. This is one of the hoppier beers around. The malts are really just ambient noise here and let the strong hop aroma pummel you into submission. The pine character dominates the juicy hop bill, followed by grassy notes, mixed with lemon peel and freshly zested grapefruit rind. The Hop Wallop has a fantasticly intense nose.  T: The follow through is as great as it was to be expected bringing in some additional flavors of pepper, coriander, creamsicle, dust and tangerine. Lingering long, dangerously dry bitter finish. Absolutely no sign of alcohol. The flavors really change/develop as this beer warms.  M: Medium body with slick texture. The carbonation is big and fizzy, plowing your tongue like its a hop oil removal service.  D: Drinkability is good, and should probably be rated higher, given that there really isn't anywhere to go from here. You can't order something different, (you won't be able to taste it!), not much will match the intensity.

Right from the tap you get a lighter golden color with a nice frothy head. When you first taste it, it is like getting punched in the face with hops and it takes their vision to another level.

That's not to say there's no malt character, cause their is; it keeps the hops from being overbearing. But, as with some other DIPAs, this beer boils down to hops in a glass.  Great beer overall. Very enjoyable and refreshing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Seanibus,4.5,"This is one I always looked forward to when it was a seasonal - glad it's now a regular part of the lineup.  Pours sunny golden and clear with a dense vigorous head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is intensely hoppy, with that sharp, spicy citrus power that speaks of the Simcoe hop. Underneath is a little of Victory's characteristically mild, clean malty backbone. The flavor is a hop bomb, again heavy on the simcoe-like citrusy punch and a round, piny bitterness on the finish. While hops dominate, there is a clean, slightly sweet malt in the middle - tastes like a powerful dose of pilsner malt in there. The mouthfeel is slick and satisfying.  The main drawback to the beer is the power of the alcohol - it is so delicious and smooth that you can hurt yourself easily by drinking too much of this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,goblue3509,4.15,"Pours a clear orangish yellow color with a thick creamy two to two and a half finger head with gives way to some nice lacing. The aroma is of a flower shop with big floral hop aroma over a sweet malt backbone. The taste is of floral hops with a nice big hop bite the encompasses the entire sip of the beer. There is also a hint of some citrus fruits as well. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Overall this is a very drinkable double, the ABV is lower than some in this class but it is well hidden. The beer is smooth and stays consisent. You could easily have a sixer of these. Solid double for someone who likes a hop bite.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,wspscott,4.13,"12oz bottle in Duvel tulip (no date)  A: Crystal clear deep gold color, thick fluffy white head, lots of lace. S: Lots and lots of hops, no hint of malt, needs more aroma hops T: Sharp bitterness, piney hops as it warms up, no hint of alcohol, needs more late addition hops. M: Oily hops and lots of carbonation make for a good mouthfeel for the style. D: A hophead's dream, lots of bitterness, but very smooth. I like that it is not overly dominated by caramel malts like some DIPAs. Goes down too easy given the alcohol level, I'm ready for another one, could be dangerous. This would be an amazing beer with more late addition hops or ideally a ton of dry hops. Definitely worth trying.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,DrinkingAleToday,4.42,"A: Pours crystal clear and golden with a medium head that leaves a fair bit of lacing.  S: Hops, hops, and more hops, huge aroma of citrus fruits, grapefruit, orange, some apricot, whiffs of honey and barley, alcohol is also present.  T: A smack in the mouth, initial huge citrus flavor which fades into some piney resins, some sting from the hop bitterness, alcohol warms the palate, some sweet malt is detectible if searched for, finishes dry. Has that burning/resin flavor you get from chewing on a fresh hop flower.  M: Medium body with fair amount of carbonation, hop flavors numb the palate. Warmth from the alcohol and a nice dry finish.  D: This is an easy drinking beer at 8.5%, The dry finish is a nice change from the malty sweetness of many DIPA's. I was going to review something else tonight but I think my palate has been ""ruined"" east coast style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,CharlatanSin,4.01,"A: Pours a clear golden orange, with a smooth one finger white head that dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing. I like my big IPAs to be hazier with a foamier head, so this didn't do much for me.  S: This is where the beer really shines. A big whiff of pine hops dominates. This hoppy heaven is complimented by some citrus hops, sweet white bread, a little honey, and something vaguely peppery.  T: Mainly follows the nose. Pine dominates the hop profile, with a decent supporting turn by grapefruit. The malt is a bit more straight caramel and less bread and honey than the nose suggested. That spicy peppery subtext is still there, though, and it makes the beer more interesting.  M: A bit light and flat for the style. In a different mood I might call it refreshing.  D: A solid dIPA that I could have a couple of, but not one of my East Coast favorites. The taste is interesting enough that I'll probably give it another try before too long, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Intelligentsia,4.33,"Appearance a plae straw through which light readily streams. The head and lacing are much more impressive, with the former fading slowly after building heavily and the latter coating the inside of my glass. Lovely visible carbonation rises.  The nose is led by large notes of citrus and a hint of alcohol. Fruits present.  Taste is bonkers -- a great balance of hop bitterness and biscuity malt that does its best to keep up with the dominant humulus lupulus. It ultimately fails but there is some wonderful interplay here, especially on the tail end of this puppy. Fruit esthers, alcohol, pine, citrus. In writing it sounds a bit like your standard IPA but this one really harmonizes beautifully.  Aggressive carbonation plays with the medium body well. Really enjoyable beer to review, but it does have a a good bit of alcohol. Probably more a sipper than a session, as it does a number on taste buds.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,billzee,4.32,"On-tap at the brewery on 12/29. Pours a golden (pilsner like) yellow with a thick foamy white head (like billowy clouds). Lots of retention during consumption. Ton of citrusy hop and pine notes and fresh cut grass. Nice sweet grapefruit taste, grassy hops, and an herbal quality I can't quite place. Dry refreshing finish. Light body with moderate carbonation. I am a big fan of Victory and I really enjoyed this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,dstc,4.35,"Pours a deep gold, light orange color. Nice foamy off-white head that falls very slow. Nice clinging sticky lace.  Big herbal hop nose. Nice spice to it.  Taste is of hops, of course. Big hops actually.  Herbal and lovely and oily in the mouth. Even a little sweet but with the hop bitter finish.  Slick and oily in the mouth, medium bodied with a little bite.  Awesome bottle of hops. Truly wonderful bottle of beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Durge,4.08,"Was overjoyed to find this on cask at Novare Res in Portland, Maine last month. It was a glowing cloudy straw amber color with a generous big bubble white head and crazy lacing. The aroma is bready citrus pine hop, and a touch of alcohol straw and maple. The taste is right on with mellow piney hops and biscuit with some pleasant honey maple. In a near full bodied liquid that offers tingly carbonation that is well beyond any cask ale I've had. A delightful brew that I highly recommend as a great, drinkable DIPA on cask!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jzeilinger,4.32,"Poured from a growler into a tulip, large, foamy two fingered white head, medium amount of carbonation, is a nice bright gold color, looks very crisp and very clear.  The aroma is a hop heads dream with maximum amounts of citrus in the nose followed with some floral, a little pine hint, and some spicy notes. The taste...ahhh...pucker up! Maximum hop flavoring with relatively few malts to bring the hops into check, the malts here are way off in the distance on the palate to almost non-existant, they are running away in terror from the massive IBU's. The taste starts out as a grapefruit overload, then morphs into a bit of faint spiciness, and finishes semi-dry, massively bitter, and with huge lingering citrus. As I work through the glass, the rich, foamy head sticks to the sides of the tulip glass.  This a medium bodied beer, exhibits medium amounts of prickliness on the tongue. This is far and away one of the most lopsided, unbalanced, and obnoxious beers I've ever had... which is probably why it's one of my favorites!! I really love this brew and it's not for the faint of heart.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,vacax,3.58,"12 oz. brown bottle. Enjoy by dated Feb 9 2010. Pours golden in color and with almost two fingers of thick white head. Low level cloudiness. The light color looks very ""West Coast"" though I probably wouldn't call the brew that. Some nice retention and good laces.  Juicy hops aroma with some pear, papaya, and floral and earthy hops. A little bit of tropical fruit and definite hop presence, but not as much pine or citrus as expected. Tastes of pear, caramel malts, perfumey hops, moderate to full bitterness on midpalate. Cookielike finish. Body is medium, maybe a tad light in ""imperial"" IPA land, but nice, bubbly but not prickly, unsticky. Decent. The last thing I want to taste is hops, not cookielike malts, so this is not quite my thing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,MP72,3.78,A- Poured a hazy amber orange into a bass tulip pint glass with a minimal head.  S-Smell was really malty with a little bit of citrus hops.  Taste- was similar to smell as far as being very Malty and a bit heavier than Hop Devil. The hops is certainly there but it is not overpowering for the most part. I did get an unusual aftertaste that I did not remember with Hop Devil.  M- good body smooth and malty  D- decent but not something I'd put several of away in a night.  Overall not bad but in all honesty I am not a huge fan of DIPA's I much prefer the traditional IPA. Balance and Harmony should not be overrated.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,PittBeerGirl,4.12,"On-tap at Bocktown tonight. I have tasted (1 oz sample) this brew at least 3 times before.  A- This beer looks like the perfect pilsner. Crystal Clear bubbly champagne colored body that is served with a good 2 finger foamy head. Head slowly subsides to a beautiful 1 finger and is retained perfectly from there. Lots and lots of lacing left behind in the glass. Beautiful...I would just expect a medium amber hue and a touch of cloudiness.  S-Wow. Hop Wallop it is. A very sweet pink grapefruit comes through first and most prominently followed by a big pine sting. These are the two most notable aromas. In the background is also wonderful spicy hop and a hint of herbal hop aromas as well.  T- Upfront is sweet...almost too sweet. A big dose of sweet, juicy pink grapefruit with maybe a hint of sugar initially. As the flavor progress one can detect a deep spiciness in the background which is barely present initially but grows for the finish and is immediately overshadowed by a big piny hop refreshing presence which seems to be the dominant character overall and it lingers...but as it lingers a huge citrus rind bitterness overshadows all as hints of piny and spicy hop flavors fade away in the background. Very interesting how this incorporates several hop characters at once and they fight for dominance...all seeming to have an almost extreme character.  M- As the appearance would suggest the body is very light and has medium to high carbonation. A slightly oily carbonation and a refreshing light character.  D- The first few times I tried this beer I did not like it at all-and I really enjoy Victory beers. I'm not sure if I can attribute the positive change toward this batch, the earliness of the hop wallop season, my changing tastes, or a combination thereof...but I am digging this beer this year. Its interesting how just as one flavor starts to get obnoxious it fades just in time to highlight another. This is an interesting well crafted brew that I am looking forward to having again this season. No ABC detected",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Beerandraiderfan,3.5,"Whoa, what's the big deal. This beer is average if it were made 3000 miles to the West.  Pours decent enough. A little darker and hazier than I would have expected. Some will probably say to balance the hop bill, but it really tastes sweet, like an imperial ESB or something. Mouthfeel lacks depth. Some different ipa hops, its just sweet. Drinkable, if you're in the mood for sweet. Perchance, this stuff wasn't ""fresh"" since it was bought in Orange County and it was a long trip, but I really don't know what is the big deal about this. Not bad, check it out, but I wouldn't expect anything like the word round here.  They should probably bottle date.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BDLbrewster,3.83,"Pours a rich golden amber color with bright highlights. Small, quickly dissipating bright white head that leaves a coating sheet of lacing.  The nose is great, fresh green, fruity hops that remind me of the smell that fresh juicy fruit gum throws off. There is a small contingent of bitter citrus pith and distant pine, but they are quite minimal in the scope of things.  The taste is laden with slightly bitter orange, pineapple and grapefruit up front. Sweet caramel comes through in the middle, and the substantially bitter finish is primarily composed of pine and and grapefruit pith with just enough alcohol bite to let you know that it's there.  Mouthfeel is dead center medium bodied in my eyes, plenty of non-overwhelming carbonation is also present.  Overall this is a good brew, one of those that you know you can always rely on. Generous bitterness with an equally substantial alcohol content. Solid Brew VICTORY!!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,generalnotsew,4.52,"A: Beautiful white fluffy head that takes up half my Duvel tulip and color is bright yellow and amber.  S: Sweet, tart, tangy. Very much grapefruit but a lot sweeter. Hops aren't really that prominent to me in the nose.  T: Nice little hop kick upfront with lots of fruity and tangy notes. Has a very clean finish.  M: Has a nice thickness to it almost in a thick stout category to me. Lays nicely on the tongue.  D: Very easy drinking. Hard to not gulp. One night I got through number 4 and felt fine. Halfway thru number 5 and I could barely see straight. Be careful with this one.  Is it the best DIPA out there? No. But is it easily a nice, clean, refreshing, tangy, hoppy and easy to get go to beer? You bet. May seem a bit pricey to some but I have to not forget it is a 6 pack. I am used to getting DIPA's in a 4 pack.  Victory was well worth the wait in TN. One of the more unique DIPA's out there.  EDIT 03/06/10 I just had it again last night and decided I needed to bump up the smell and taste factor as I believe the time of my review it really wasn't fresh. This one had a enjoy by date of 11/15/10 so it was pretty fresh and my how deliciously hoppy it was. I have now decided to make Victory my go to brewery for many different styles.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Aroma is full of floral, grassy hops with a strong citrus, especially grapefruit underpinning present.  Taste is full of floral, grassy hops that coat the mouth and leave a decent amount of hop ecstasy as a result. Only a slight hint of bready malt is present.  Mouthfeel is full of lingering floral, grassy hops and bready malt. Subtle, yet delicious. Correct for the style.  A very nice, drinkable version of the style. Better than Hop Devil because it uses more hops. That logic sometimes bothers people but not me. I enjoy an explosion of hops every now and then.

Truely powerful aroma.  Taste- I normally am a stout guy, but this is truely a great Imperial IPA, this is what defines the standard. A really powerful hop preseance, while i'm not really a fan of the malt in this beer, as it takes a back seat, it is a great DIPA. One can note the different hop variety's.

345,14916,Ek0nomik,4.42,"Poured In: Snifter Glass Purchased At: The Coffee Grounds (Eau Claire, WI)  Appearance: Pours a crystal clear golden tangerine and amber color with a finger of head. The head dissipates quickly, leaving behind a thin layer of white foam that gets thicker towards the center where the bubbles are climbing up. Speaking of the bubbles, the beer has a medium amount of effervescence, typical for an IIPA. After a few swirls in my snifter I await the lace. The lace is quite thin; the thick sheets just don't want to come out and play.  Smell: Ooh, more hops than I was expecting. A really nice earthy, tropical and citrus nose. It's a blend of pine and grass, mango and peach, grapefruit and orange. The hops are all blowing off of a nice sweet malt backbone. Smells like a damn good beer.  Taste: The first splash of beer reveals pale malt with just a touch of sweetness to uphold the hops. After the malt comes the wave of hops, including the same notes listed above: pine (very prominent), grass, orange peel and mango are the top flavors. It's a tad bitter, a little more sweet caramel malt might have hit the spot. It's hard to complain though, this is a great beer with a great hop profile. Now that the beer left the mouth, I'm left with a nice grapefruit flavor coating my teeth.  Mouthfeel: A medium bodied beer with an ever so slightly above medium amount of carbonation. A dash of hop oils coat the teeth and tongue after each sip.  Drinkability: Twelve ounces makes this an easy beer to drink on a weeknight. The hop profile in the nose and on the palate is wonderful. I wasn't expecting this to be as good of a beer as it was. A top notch IIPA for sure.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Smell: unctuous hop aroma; earthy, funky, even a bit metallic. This beer smells like it means business.  Taste: a bit more dynamic than the aroma. Flavor starts off with all brassy, metallic hops which fade into a more malt-based flavor. There is a grapefruit flavor toward the middle, but then flavor falls off pretty quickly. This is a big, intensely flavored DIPA, but it lacks finesse (if that makes any sense).  Mouthfeel: nice medium body with a good level of carbonation. Solid.  Drinkability: this is darn drinkable for 8.5%, but it's more of a slow sipper than a session brew. This is for its flavor as much as its alcohol.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,TexIndy,3.6,"Been a few years since I first tried this one (was surprised to see that I hadn't reviewed it) so thought I'd try it again. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. There is a place on the front label where they tried to print the bottling/best by info but something must have happened to their machine as it's jagged and smeared. Was a cloudy lemon yellow color with a bunch of floating bits. Massive amount of carb streams as well especially considering no etching in the glass. Looks way over-carbed. Had large two finger white head that settled into a thick foam fed by the carb. Good lacing.  The aroma was hop bomb with pine resin and floral hops dominating. Some muted grapefruit and no real malt presence. The taste was very bitter hops from start to finish with no malt or c-hop to counter it. Overly bitter for my taste. Mouthfeel was full. Very over-carbonated so filled me full of gas and really distracted from enjoying it. Very bitter and dry finish which is within style so no hit for it but I prefer the less overly bitter finishes.  Overall, a good but not great ADIPA. Lacked some countering balance to the very bitter hop bill. Rotation - available here in TX. Got a six pack and that's enough for me - overly bitter and unbalanced.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,feelmefoam,4.53,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a Dogfish Specialty glass.  Pours a bright yet hazy pale golden color. Bright and murky at the same time, it looks a bit like a liquid lemon drop with some lively carbonation coming out of the haziness. Put up about a finger of egg-white foam that leaves a solid ring of lace around the outside of the glass. A very inviting looking beer.  This thing is overflowing with hops. The extremely fragrant nose is absolutely chock-full of them. Citrusy lemon and grapefruit leap from the glass, assaulting the nose with sour hop goodness. Can't wait to taste this.  Yummm... pure hoppiness. The lemon and grapefruit citrus hops that were running rampant in the aroma are back with friends; there is also a piney, sappy aspect to the beer's flavor assault on the tongue. Though big in flavor and hoppiness, the hops are fairly smooth all the way through the finish, probably balanced a bit by some pale malts, but fight back towards the end of each swig.  A long, lingering flavor and a medium mouthfeel provides a lasting but smooth finish to the beer. A moderate amount of carbonation and the cornucopia of hops provide a mask for the alcohol that's present; you'd have no idea it was 8.5% if you didn't read the label.  In all, a very drinkable DIPA that is overflowing with hops. For the intensity of the flavors, the beer is suprisingly smooth and drinkable. My first DIPA, and it was not a disappointment.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Pretty clean, clear and innocent looking with a decent amount of foam on top.  Aroma - some syrupy sweetness, a bit grainy and some suppressed hop citrus smells. Where are all the big grapefruity and piney smells? I feel like something is missing from the aroma, mainly the big, bold smell of hops! *Sigh*  Taste - bitter and slightly acidic. Leaves my mouth feeling like I've been drinking some seriously hoppy stuff but the taste is not there as it wasn't there in the aroma. I am not sure what has happened to my beloved Hop Wallop. As it warms some of those flavors come out so maybe it was too cold? I don't know...  Overall - not the Hop Wallop I used to know and love. I don't know what has happened over the years but it certainly isn't the intensely hoppy insane hop bomb I remember. Oh well, still a decent brew and a bomber makes a good vessel for trying it out and not having to buy a whole sixer. I still love the label.

There is also a sweet malt backbone backing up these dank hops. It's hard to pick out exactly what aroma the malt is, but what I can say is that it is similar to what the malt in St. Boisterous smells like.  T: Very similar to the nose. The only difference Is that I am getting a massive amount of white grape and lemon-grass flavor in addition to the spicy, earthy, dank hops. Decent amount of bitterness. Also, the malt backbone is just as the nose suggests.  M: Light bodied, some hop resin, and good carbonation.

Mouthfeel is hop fwd bitterness on palate with a solid but tolerable bitter finish. Medium+ carbonation. Light-medium/thin body.  Drinkability is a 3.5 IMHO. This is a fine IIPA to showcase the bold powers of hoppy-ness. It's a bit more pine dominant than I prefer, and I prefer a bit more malt backbone to support the hops - even on a IIPA.

Tons of pine flavor with huge hop bitterness with a touch of sourness and just enough malty sweetness to add a touch of balance. Really crisp and dry finish.

T- Grapefruit and orange bitterness upfront with a caramel malt background to keep things kind of balanced. Finishes with a bitter aftertaste.  M- Really smooth. Light to medium body and carbonation.  D- Really easy drinking for the ABV. The caramel malt helps to keep this beer from becoming less drinkable from the considerable amount of hops.

About 1/4 inch of head with nice lacing. Flavor was packed full of HOPs that would be expected by it's title. To me it seemed that it was missing someting to balance it out.

A A little surprised to find a lager look a like in my glass with a nice head and good lacing. The body is very, very clear. 3.5  S Again, a slight surprise in that the smell was not very strong. After a few sniffs I picked up some sweet grapefruit bitterness but it was not obvious like I thought it might be. I liked the smell, though. 4.0  T Sweet malt actually hit me first and then the promised hops kick in and, well, I got walloped with them and they were so bitter that they were to the point of being acidic. This turns me off very frankly as it drives down the drinkability quite a bit. It is difficult for me to enjoy this level of bitterness. It felt as if the surface of my throat was deteriorating with this bitterness that lingered well into the aftertaste. I had to take several sips of water while trying to drink this. 2.0  M Well, huge with the bitterness, elevated ABV and even the sweet malt beginning. This time, though, I did not like the feel due to the spike of bitterness that lingered far too long. 2.5  D Again, driven down by the acid soak of hops bitterness. 2.0  Notes: I realize that the point was to have a very hoppy beer but this is too much for me.

Smell: This beer has a strong citrus fruit scent to it. There is also floral and sweet smells present.  Taste: Very pleasant tastes here. It starts off smooth with some mild hop flavors, and then transitions into a sweet grapefruit/orange sweetness. It seems to finish off with a prominent bitter hops taste. This is much more sweet than I expected, and not as hoppy as I would have thought. It is still a very pleasant beer.  Mouthfeel: The beer feels nice. Carbonation is fairly low, but not too low.

The hops provide a overwhelmingly power blast of resiny bitterness after the initial sweet fruits, which lasts to the finish and continues in a prolonged aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Fresh and lively in the palete. Quite heavy towards the end, and a slightly oily texture.

The smell was pink grapefruit, lemon, pine, maltiness, grass, and floral herbs. The flavor yielded all of the above in generous amounts, dissolving mid-palate to a more grassy/herbal/woodiness, and then finishing a pleasant dry bitter, with bitter/grapefruit/pine aftertaste hints. The body was medium, with subtle carbonation, even from the cask (must've been a fresh tapping). Despite the strength, the flavor beckons you for more, and before you know, it's a session.

345,14916,stevenseg,4.08,"Let me first just say that I have recently indulged in the Dark Horse Crooked Tree IPA and I was out to find an IPA that just is going overboard on hops. I am going to try to keep this as unbiased as possible given my current taste.  this beer poured a hazy pale golden color with a sticky one-finger head that is still sticking around (no pun intended) though I have let this beer sit. All is typical of a hoppy beer.  The aroma is very fruity. Sweet. That indicates a heavy malt content and less hops, which is typically indicated by a floral smell.  Though not called an IPA by Victory Brewing, this beer is very hoppy, and dry-hopped at that, which pretty much indicates an IPA. The beer is very sweet with a hoppy bitter finish. Like I said, it's more of an IPA than an ale that goes overboard with fresh hops.  I am a huge fan of creamy beers. Hop Wallop is creamy enough to have mild carbonation and prevent that crispness that I feel takes from the overall mouthfeel.  Overall, this beer is rich and heavy on the IPA characteristics, which is great for IPA lovers, just not what I was looking for today.

Nice looking deep golden appearance with a generous ivory creamy head with the tiny bubbles letting some bigger bubbles make way to the top before they explode as the head fizzles down. Head offers the jello quiver when the glass is gently jiggled.  As far as the smell goes I immediately appreciate the pineapple. Big ripe pineapple with tangerine and hop resin. Powerful right after the pour but fizzles a little quick as the head dissipates.  Big pineapple in the taste with piney, floral flavors and ruby red grapefruit.  Mouthfeel is great but not perfect. A little too much bubbles that could have been better balanced with a heavier feel. Still moderately medium-heavy with a nice texture.  Very drinkable. A bold IPA but not a hop bomb like the ruination. Much better balanced even thought the bitterness from the hops still makes quite an appearance. Highly recommended.

Malt is present and biscuity, but this smells mostly of hops. Grapefruit is also noticeable.  T - Very hoppy and citrusy up front and rides out to a nice bitter, bready finish. Packs a punch, flowing from over the top in your face hops to a nice malty finish. Very nice. Starts out sweet and fruity and becomes earthy and bitter towards the end. Seem to notice more flavors in each sip too!  M - Lighter bodied than most DIPAs and not as oily or slick feeling. Looks overcarbonated but it feels just right.  D - This is dangerously drinkable and does not taste very much of alcohol. Just delicious hop juice! Really packs a punch so I can usually spread out a six pack over a week. It is very sneaky indeed.  Overall, not like other DIPAs as it is not as dark or heavy. Solid, over the top hoppy beer that you just have to try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,blackie,4.4,"a: golden in color, with carbonation cascading from the bottom to the surface to settle into a thick, frothy white head, cask-typical great retention and lace  s: rich citrus rind hop presence, mostly grapefruit, atop a clean but full flavored honeyed pale malt presence, candied citrus rinds, wonderfully aromatic with all components complimentary to each other  m: lusciously smooth body with a delicate carbonation - far from flat, though, as is common with cask ales  t: initial flavors of pungent citrus rinds are beautifully tempered by the cask serving, smoothing any harsh acidity and leaving a candied pulpy presence atop a honeyed pale malt body, bitterness builds into the finish with a grapefruit bite, absurdly smooth blend of assertive flavors  d: limited only by the abv, a superb dipa  0.4 litre glass at the brewpub",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ditch,4.39,"It poured a beautiful hazy golden with a thick white head that lingers for a bit before fading to a ring. lacing hangs on nicely.  The aroma of this beer is amazing! Hops Hops and more Hops! You name an aroma from hops and you'll find it here. It's pungent. It burns and makes you go back for more. Very deep and complex. Citrus, spice, pine... but not much of the barley makes it through.  The barley finds your tongue but for a split second before the piney bitterness of the hops takes over. Followed by a citrus, and spiciness. The bitterness hangs around well after you have swallowed it down. WOW this is hoppy!  The mouthfeel is great. Wouldn't make much of a session beer I don't think because of the intense flavor. Definitely going to ruin my taste buds for anything else that's hoppy tonight.  An awesome ale! Definitely a must try. I'm going to buy another to age and try again in a year or so!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,mikel52588,4.5,"Appearance: Pours a walloping 3 finger length head, with the nice soapy lacing that slides down the glass, and has a straight up golden hue.  Smell: Hop wallop for sure, its all up in your nostrils oh so pungent; herby, citrusy sweet  Taste: Oh yes this packs a punch, for all you hopheads out there, this is oh so delightful. The hops flow and are followed by a malty sweetness and citrus.  Mouthfeel: The aftertaste is actually good. Carbonation is a nice touch; goes down smooth.  Drinkability: Very drinkable, this beer is awesome. Not too heavy, not too light, it gives it too ya just right. Its smooth and its hoppy and its bitterness is not over powering.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,craftaholic,4.57,"Appearance: Pours a crystal clear golden hue that has a nice healthy head that leaves behind some legs and blotching.  Smell: Delicate yet delicious. Very citrusy with waves of both lemon and orange scented hops coming out to play. There is also a bit of piney herbaceous pinecone hop oil that dances in your nostrils. Surprisingly there is even a hint of mango and nectarine that is in there once you get past the prevalent hops.  Taste: Wallop indeed, has a big sticky bouquet of citrus hops on top of more hops that ranges from almost a creamy lemonade to an orangepeel that mixes nicely with the woody hops that taste like that of the forest with their herbaceous character. No malt in sight this one gives you straight bitter and I thank it for that.  Mouthfeel: A zesty light bodied brew they had just a right amount of carb in this brew.  Drinkability: A double IPA with this kind of drink-ability should be illegal. Hides the abv well in flavor and drinks like a nice satisfying fizzy lifting drink that is so tempting to devour but truly is a sipper.  Overall: The guys at victory have managed to steal my heart a second time, first time with the devil next with a wallop.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,chicagobeerriot,4.06,"Thanks to mikeyv35 for the tasty extra... Pours a heavily veiled amber with a thick pillow of head that coats as it relieves.  The smell is a bit different for the style: I get a lot of the peach / mango hop scents, but almost no pine and just a bit of malty raisin in the background.  Mouthfeel is about where it should be: medium bodied, but with enough carbonation to complement some of the hop crispness that appears toward the end.  The taste is really complex; every sip can lead to a new flavor. Things actually start out on the sweet side, with a veritable fruit salad (mango, pineapple and fresh apricot). That combines with a bit of sweet cream from the malt, providing a very interesting opening for a DIPA. But the bitterness will not be denied... The sweetness segues gradually into a low earthy bitterness and, towards the end, a crisp hop snap at the back of your throat. If you like your DIPAs complex and well-balanced, this should be on your list.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,tr4nc3d,3.94,"12fl oz bottle poured into my tumbler  This has a very interesting color which is hard to define. Kind of like a bright golden color or a very light orange color. As I poured this into my cup it produced a big 4 inch white dense head. Great head retention that last througout the beer and leaves soapy lacing sticking to the sides of my glass  Smell is of ripe citrus flavors that I rarely ever encounter an any other IPA/DIPA that is not coming straight from the tap. Pineapple dominates the smell, with grapefruit, and tangerines. Damn this beer smells wonderful and full of sweet nectar waiting for it to be consumed.  I do not get the dominating citrus smell as I hoped to get in the taste. This starts off with a very slight to minimal citrus flavor that holds on until the bittering hops come into play. I did not get any taste of malts and the hops dominated.  Mouthfeel is full bodied with high carbonation. Bitter taste on the finish and aftertaste.  I do not mind hops and have grown accustomed to them, but like I mention in some of my reviews, if your looking for more of that citrus taste in your IPAs/DIPAS then I would pass this up.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Mit,4.32,Pours a nice dark amber with a short lived head. Minimal lacing on glass.  Smell-Citrus notes and grapefruity hops dominate with some mild malty notes at end...they almost get lost.  Taste-Nice spicey grapefruit hops. Some smokey notes with a nice smooth malt aftertaste. I deliberatly waited to review this until I had had it a few times as it's super hoppy and it was hard to pick out tastes other than hops the first time out.  Mouthfeel was in keeping with a beer of 8.5% abv.  Drinkability is that it's very dangerously drinkable. I do think that if I had several of these in a night I would wake with a brutal hangover.  One of my favourite Double IPAs.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,augustgarage,4.1,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish Head snifter. Enjoy by date reads ""April 16, 2010.""  Orange peel body with amber highlights, topped by a slender finger of ivory foam that recedes to a thin island fenced in by sticky lacing. Decent legs, brilliant clarity.  Nice ""East Coast"" hop profile with an emphasis on esters and fruit over pine and pungency. Orange, nectarine, dandelion greens, along with some ""air freshener"" scents (reminds me a little of clay-based cat litter actually). Slight background of toast.  Flavor is very well balanced between clean malt (brings to mind a young, sherried single malt in fact) and fruity/bitter hops. Very long finish, dry and bitter - like grapefruit marmalade on toast. A little lacking in complexity or intensity compared to some Double IPAs I've tried.  Medium-light bodied, with sufficient carbonation. Slightly warming, but alcohol is well hidden.  A very good, very drinkable Double IPA, though it could get lost in the crowd of this very popular style as it isn't as superlative as the very best examples.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Thur123,4.39,"Ok, one of my first DIPAs. The color is a hazy orange with half a centimeter of white head after the inch I got died down. Little lacing so far but it seems like it might, the retention is nice. And for the smell...Holy shite...Grapefruit, cherries and something else that's smells strong but I can't quite put my finger on it, Kind of like orangeade or orange juice. By far one of the most unique and sweetest smelling beers I've had the pleasure to whiff. Very little floral aroma for this style it seems, but I love that.  Glug glug glug  Taste contains a sticky sweetness that first reminds me of a kind of tart grapefruit juice with notes of floral hops that didn't come through in the smell as much. The presence of citrus flavors in this is amazing to me. The presence of cherries and orange juice make the initial hit of flavor so good. The taste of grapefruit and floral hops make up the aftertaste, meaning (to me at least) that the sweetness avoids the after taste somewhat, which is hardly unsetting. The malt profile is buried beneath all the flavorful hops. The mouth feel is a little sticky but good at delivering the flavor. This is my favorite DIPA so far and makes me quite excited to try other varieties.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Beergeeknut,4.6,Appearance: Poured into a snifter is a slightly hazy orange copper color. On top of it all is a light white foamy head about two fingers thick.  Aroma: Very big aroma from sweet fruits like passion fruit and cherries. Oh and did I mention the incredible the hops give off. Wonderful grapefruit notes with piney notes swirling around so very happily.  Taste: This one is not called Hop Wallop for nothing wow what a beast. Hops on top of more hops that has a very nice bready texture on the pallate. A little light on the carbonation but that does not take anything away from the flavor. Great hints of grapefruit and piney notes.  Notes: This is a stunning double i.p.a nicely done. Cheers.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,nanertak,4.47,"Appearance: 1 finger head, light golden amber. Good amount of carbonation.  Nose: Floral hops. Pure and simple. Hints of honey and pale malts.  Taste: Sour grapefruit, fading into mild pale malts, and into a flowery pine hop finish. Long and lingering. ABV is well masked.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, medium carbonation. Coats the mouth like a double, but no alcohol heat or stickiness.  Drinkability: Love it. Crisp, refreshing, very satisfying.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

The taste begins with some warning shots by alcohol diacetyls ... ooooweee, this is gonna' be some fun! What follows is a complex mixture of citrus hop tang balanced by the previously mentioned sweet malty alcohol notes.  The mouthfeel is medium/heavy with some tingly, lively carbonation. I'm into effervescent brews, so, me likely.  The drinkability for this big double ipa (8.5% abv) is very good ... a sipper, but it's so tempting to sip really frequently ... hehe.

The nose is quite sweet and a bit hoppy with some citrus notes as well.  Taste is very citrus with a whole lotta hops. Quite interesting and very sharp. Leaves a kind of odd off flavor in my mouth, maybe it's a little musty. For an IIPA it's super drinkable and there's no hint of the higher abv. Very solid.

345,14916,beerwolf77,4.42,Poured into a pint glass this beer is bright golden yellow that shines in the light. The head is bone white and two inches high. After settling a moderate amount of lace is left around my glass. The aroma is super sour fruit.Pine sap and juicy grapefruit is dominant. It's a hop boquet for sure. The flavor is super hoppy. Grassy pine and bitter fruit. A hint of buttered bread comes in at the finish. Medium body with a rather dry finish. Moderate carbonation. For a hop bomb this is extremly drinkable.

345,14916,jera1350,4.22,"First had a Hop Wallop a couple of years ago when I was more beer uneducated. I wasn't real impressed then, but upon further review, I have to say I was wrong.  Pineapple juice yellow with a thin layer of foam that reduces to a ring. Sticky looking foam. A few specks of lace, but the ring remains throughout the whole beer.  Smells like pineapple juice with fresh citrus hops behind. Grassy and picked up a hint of what I can only say reminds me of Pepto Bismal.  Much like the nose minus the PB. Crisp and juicy. The hops have a nice bite, but are kept in check by a nice light malt. The pineapple sweetness is excellent. Not the most complexity for a DIPA, but what it does have is working wonderfully. This would be even better fresh.  Creamy mouthfeel. Mostly soft on the tongue, but has a slight sharp edge to it. Feels a little thinner than many top DIPA's.  This drinks really easy. It drinks as easy as a single IPA, but with a ton more flavor and mouthfeel. A great take on a DIPA. Pretty easy to find to, which helps its cause further.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,woosterbill,3.67,"12oz bottle, best by 3/9/10, into a Duvel tulip.  A: Slightly hazy and very pale straw colored body topped with a half-inch white foam head that quickly dissipates into a ring around the glass. Surprisingly good lacing for so little head, though. Overall, considerably paler than I would expect in a DIPA.  S: Nothing but hops, and mostly of the pine/floral variety. Just the slightest bit of citrus on the tail end.  T: All hop bitterness, with pine and floral hop flavors dominant. Exceedingly dry on the finish, with next to no malt body of any kind to balance out the hops. Pretty one-dimensional.  M: Medium bodied with a nice touch of hoppy oiliness, light but noticeable carbonation.  D: Nothing remarkable here either way. A bit too dry and bitter to be something I'd want to drink all night, but the sheer hoppiness does have certain allure.  Notes: While by no means a bad DIPA, this let me down in the end. It just doesn't have the malt/hops balance that I've become used to finding in my favorite examples of the style (e.g. 90min and ST Unearthly), but neither does it have the delicious citrus hop profile of a hop-bomb like Ruination. Worth a shot, I suppose, but not something I'll seek out in the future.  Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

The smell is a bit more muted than I remember. Also I remember this as being super piney. While the pine is still present, I am actually picking up more grapefruit.  Nice bitterness. Earthy pine hops are balanced with a small dose of malty sweetness. Fortunately, the sweetness is not overdone. The bitterness has a nice lasting effect.  Medium bodied. Carbonation is not abundant, but enough to give it some drinkability.

M: Full bodied and creamy.  D: This is a well balanced DIPA, and not the hop bomb I was expecting. Easy to drink, but not overly impressive either.

There's big bitter flavor that's actually pretty complex. Notes of citrus and pine throughout with just a bit of funkiness. It finishes with a long lasting prevalent hop character.

345,14916,alleykatking,4.2,Had at Max's in Baltimore  A- Poured a little hazy with a beautiful golden yellow almost slight orange color. It was given to me with almost no head to it which was fine by me because I was thirsty. No real lacing on the sides of the glass...just soapy looking and that slid down the glass into the beer.  S- Nice bitter piney hop smell to this right off the get go. There is a sweet malty undertone with this as well that mixes with a tail end of citrus-y hops. Nothing to over the top but then again I wasn't expecting this to smell so bitter. This was a welcome sight to me.  T- Nice crisp dry bitter hop taste upfront. A semi-sweet malt backbone comes in for a small second while a citrus hop ending balances this beer back out to a DIPA. Nothing over the top once again which was nice but only because at the time I didn't want a tounge crusher.  M- Medium-light mouthfeel. Carbonation not all there but still made a nice sipping beer. Oily resin left on the tounge made you want another sip almost right away. Good clean feeling left on the palate while the beer was in the mouth.  D- This was a very drinkable beer on cask. I am a fan of the bottle but almost prefer this on cask rather than bottle.

Not a good looking beer, I was expecting alot more out of the appearance.  Smells like citrusy hops with some sweet malt in the back of it. You can almost smell a syrupy sweetness, I'm assuming due to the malts.  My first sip is taken and it reveals a pretty powerful hop bitterness and it wasn't as citrusy as the smell. Now I know why this is called Hop Wallop. The taste primarily is a focus of bitterness rather than a balanced bouquet of citrusy hops that I look for. Overall though, the taste isn't bad but not what I look for in an IPA that I will drink regularly.  It's pretty light feeling in your mouth. Almost like a lager but not bubbly.

Aggressive pour evokes a 1/4 inch of bright white head that falls fairly quickly and leaves an impressive lace. Color is a pale cloudy amber.  Nose- a hop bounty assaults my nasal passages, pine resin and the essence of grapefruit rind. Mild caramels.  Palate- First off after smelling this brew I feel like Horace, the guy on the label according to the legend. i.e bright eyed and foaming at the mouth, and I am not disappointed. Bitter grapefruit rind, a fair amount of sweetness, followed by a orange, and a very long drawn out bitter finish. Alcohol is totally hidden.  Mouthfeel- Active carbonation, slick and dry.

Golden hues support a fine, persistent head (right down to the end of the glass) with lots of bubbles, smelling a little sweet, a little fruity and hoppily floral.  Now, admittedly I will first reach for almost anything over an IPA (90 min being a notable exception), but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate my hops in due course! The very first taste surprises me with malt, how sweet and light it is, followed immediately by that heavy bitterness that body slams your tongue and lies there for a long time after. It deserves its name, for sure. Some light citrus eases through all the hop, but after the first few sips my tongue is too walloped to remember the malty sweetness. Otherwise, the beer is crisp, decently smooth and overall quite drinkable.

The flavor is a nice mixture of hops, grapefruit, citrus notes and a sweet maltiness that adds some thickness to the mouthfeel, but not too much, which is nice.  Overall, I am fairly impressed with this beer.

Of course the hops are there 1st and foremost! Also some light twang of lemon. finishes a bit acidic with carbonation and more hops attacking your tounge.  Mouth feel is a bit on the medium side. Not as ""creamy"" as some other IPAS I've had.  Can't see myself savoring this beer as I would like it to be..its damn good! Definitely fixed my hop craving. I do feel like its not as balanced as, say Hop Devil, but I dont feel that too many of this type are too balanced. Not a bad thing at all...Another awesome beer from one of my favorite local breweries!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BigAl723,4.32,"I purchased this as a single bottle at my local market.  A: A nice crisp golden color. A little hazy but I was still able to see right through it. A little head that dissipated quite fast.  S: Pine, grapefruits, and citrus. I get a hint of cherry but it procrastinates to come through until the very end. This smell is very inviting, I definitely want to taste it...now!  T: Not as heavy as most DIPA's but still very tasty. As I drank this I started to notice a lemon taste. It reminded me of being a kid sipping lemonade on a hot summer day.  M: Light mouthfeel, nothing too wild going on here. Just right...  D: Like I mentioned earlier, not as heavy as some DIPA's. Example, Stone Ruination and Bell's Hopslam but it goes down oh so smooth. I could take out four or five of these but then I probably wouldn't be able to walk. That can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the situation.  Overall I love Hop Wallop. A beer that I used to drink a lot. This is my first HW in probably almost two years. It used to be on tap in Ann Arbor but it some how made its way off the tap list.

A - poured a hazy yet still lightly golden colored delight w/ a sizable 2 finger head whcih proved to have some decent retention and fairly nice lacing as the beer worked its way down my snifter.  S - citrus(lemoney) and piney hops smack your nose first thing. what a bountiful bouquet of hops, with a touch of what i beleive may be honey in the backround. smells like heaven(a hophead heaven if you will)  T - just as good as it smells. a total hop bomb w/ some notes of lemon and honey and a breif sweet malt makes itself known, but as i said VERY briefly. this is one tastey-ass bitter beer.  Mf - medium bodies, and medium carbonation. I didn't experience much sticky or oilyness, just a decent sized beer sliding down smoothly.  D - pretty damn easy to kick this one back because of the exceptional flavor and lighter body than onther DIPAs, but one must respect the abv, cause a couple of these will give you a hop wallop to the teeth for sure.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,schmitter,3.73,"This was my first hand pump cask beer.  Appearance was light orange/gold with a thin head.  Smelled bitter and spicy with some citrus.  Taste was definetely creamy due to the lack of carbonation. Hops, bitter grapefruit, and slightly malty.  It went down less-than smooth and was kind of chewy.  A pretty good offering from Victory, but I think I enjoy it from the bottle more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Buschyfor3,4.29,"10oz drafts at Rich O's/Sportstime Pizza in New Albany, IN.  A: Golden amber body, quite vibrant with stunning highlights throughout. A good, rocky white, foamy head leaves thick lacing down the inside of the glass.  S: What a sweet nose! I'm getting grassy hops and smooth clover honey in large doses. There's not much hop bitterness in the nose - really just sweet, grassy aromas, a touch of citrus in there too, and then sweetness from honey and the malt backbone.  T: Like the nose, there is a nice, mellow, grassy hop sweetness that hits at the start along with flashes of citrus (tangerine, pineapple, lemon) and sweet clover honey. Some tart, rind-like flavors and a touch of hoppy bitterness does break through after the intial sweetness - afterall, this is a DIPA - but it stays suprisingly sweet throughout. Finish reintroduces that sweet honey flavor mingling with malty, bready notes and a drying grapefruit and tangerine kick that lingers long on the tongue. Probably one of the sweetest DIPAs I've tasted (mind you, I still haven't cracked my bottle of DFH 120). Really enjoyed the flavors here.  M: Seems to have a lighter body for a double IPA - the carbonation is crisp and really cuts down on the slickness on the palate.  D: An perfect summer beer if you ask me. Quite refreshing, sweet and relatively easy to drink - the 8.5% ABV is completely hidden. My review took twice as long to write as it did for me to finish one glass and order a second.  Really enjoyed the flavors in this beer. I'm not a huge hophead, but this is the kind of IPA that I enjoy. For some reason, I expected this to just wallop me over the head with bitter, earthy, piney hops like many other DIPAs I've tried. But this is an East Coast DIPA and it is quite different and I really enjoyed the blending of citrusy flavors with honey-like sweetness and the malts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Unfortunately, that completely threw off the taste, and I couldnt give it a fair review. Now, I'm here to give her another shot. Here we go!  Appearance- Poured a clear golden color, capped with a frothy, white head that left a nice lacing.  Smell- Hops are present, but backed with a little sweetness...like honey.  Taste- A nice, subtle hoppy bite. Real crisp. Notes of sweetness. Again, i'm tasting a little honey or SOMETHING in there. Can't exactly put my finger on it. Good as hell, nonetheless.  Mouthfeel- Light-medium body, with a bit of carbonation. Went down easily.  Drinkability- I'll definitely buy this again.

The smell of this bad boy is exceptional. One of the best smelling DIPA's I have come across. Very hoppy aroma with a slight scent of alcohol. The taste is initially pure hop with somewhat of a bitter after taste. There is a small amount of caramel malt detectable as well. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous but in a good way. You can really detect the hop acidity. I could drink a few of these, but it is in no way sessionable. However no good DIPA is.

T: Hoppy bitterness makes it difficult to pick out anything else. Sweet malt becomes slightly more prominent as it warms up, but it still doesn't stand much of a chance against the hops. Honeyish-grassy aftertaste.  M: Nice and sticky.  T: One of the harsher DIPAs I've had. I prefer a bit more balanced, but if you like to drink your hops straight without much of a malt chaser, you'll probably dig this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,popery,3.85,"A solid DIPA with good hop flavor. The beer pours a medium amber gold color with a creamy white head and good lacing. The aroma is floral and piney, full of hops. There's a hint of a strong, simple malt flavor in there, as well. The flavor is similar, lots of bitter hops and a good, sugary malt backbone. The hops don't come through quite as fully as with the top DIPAs, but it's still an excellent beer. It's on the bitter side of the style, but it's not quite a palate stripper. I can't say that this is my favorite DIPA or even favorite Midwest DIPA, but it's still a very good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

I definitely get honey in the nose. Some maltyness as well, but lemony citrus and hops prevail.  T: Wow, hit by the hops immediately. Citrusy and piney. So bitter! Leaves an aftertaste that does not let up, I'm truly walloped by the hops, HA!. The sheer bitter aftertaste, which is the most interesting part of this beer, tastes of lemon zest.  M/D: Great carbonation, nice body for an IIPA. However, the aftertaste doesn't exactly persuade me to come back to this one. I don't think I could drink more than one of these in a sitting.

Drinkability: this i have heard is too hardcore to drink but i think it is decent, i could drink it often but at nearly 12/6er, fuggettaboudit  Overall this brew is not as hardcore on the hops as i've heard, not to what im used to, but I am glad i tried it and would recommend you do the same as it might be your new favorite.!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Drinkability-a sipper for sure, complex, maybe a little harsh.  Overall- a nice example of the Double IPA, lives up to the hype, I love hops but this did veer towards the VERY hoppy end of the spectrum.

345,14916,deanhead,3.97,"Billed as an American Double IIPA. No shit eh? I first had this on tap at Victory in Downington. Terrrific beer. this very well could have been my first experience with the American Double IIPA when I enjoyed it back in 2007. Since then I have enjoyed countless beers brewed in this style.  This review is from a bottle that my lovely wife recently picked up for me.  Appearance is Amber almost tawny in color. Not quite orange, not quite amber, but the hue is somewhere in between.  Aroma is honey like with slight hints of pine cones and evergreen tree's. Some alcohol in the nose.  Taste is sweet, with hints of honey and some light spiciness, with a bit of a malty biscuity taste.  Rich full bodied beer that improves at is warms up. Brilliant dank goodness in a glass. Finishes remarkably dry, crisp and clean despite the initial sweetness at first sip.  Yet another fabulously drinkable beer from the folks at Victory. They keep me coming back for more. They really know their stuff and are usually spot on for hitting the style they set out to brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,elniko,4.32,"Poured from bottle into Stella glass.  A: Fairly light golden amber with huge pillowy head which stuck around and left very nice lacing.  S: Hops and pepper present in the nose, I almost get some Belgian yeastiness too which I found peculiar.  T & M: As the name implies hops are very apparent but this definitely is one of the most balanced DIPAs that I've encountered. Mouthfeel does not have high carbonation. The malt is apparent throughout along with the hops. No citrus or grapefruit tones, not really piney either. The finish does have somewhat silky flowery tones. This is definitely a unique brew.  D: For an DIPA, quite drinkable although the high ABV would limit me to a few at a time. I'm pleased that this will now be a year round brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,daledeee,4.13,"This beer poured a nice yellow/orange clear color and a very nice head with lace to match. The nose is quite fresh, mostly floral.  Taste is quite delicate. Good hops up front which diminishes almost immediately to a citrus and more gentle hop approach and then ends with a little oily finish.  This is one of the more enjoyable balanced IPA style beers I have had in quite some time. AS the head went away a quick swirl of the glass gave a renewal of the wonderful head and a nice foamy flavorful treat.

The taste was more malty as well, with a kick in the face of hops immediately after. to dry with big gulps, but was perfect with sips and some food. was medium with good carbonation. i honestly expected a bit more hops, but in retrospect, i think the hops were more there, but i was thrown off by the early malt flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

It is definitely not one of my favorites, but it is better than I remembered.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,soulgrowl,4.07,"Sunny, clear yellow, no darker than a Helles, witha thin beer-stained ivory head. Fruity and piney hops leap from the glass - very, very Christmasy with orange, lemon, evergreen, rummed-up raisins, and malts that smell of caramel, toffee, and cake. It is redolent of fruitcake, booze included - there is a surge of alcohol if you sniff too hard, but still, this is not too aggressive. Predominantly biscuity and more malty than expected, but the hops do indeed deliver a wallop, though it comes on a bit delayed, like a counterattack to the malts' first strike. Moscatel and orange rind make this quite fruity, but there are earthier things afoot as well - brown bread, pine, carnations, and warm, grainy alcohol, a bit medicinal and reminiscent of a gin and tonic. Soft cask mouthfeel works well here; it is a bit syrupy, but higher carbonation isn't necessary as the hops do a fine job keeping this clean and balanced (though not exactly dry). Intense yet drinkable - very good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,NODAK,2.6,"The aroma is very, very hoppy. All hops. Mostly citric it seems, maybe a little piney. But very hoppy.  And the taste?? Well...it's about as guessed. Somewhat floral hops upfront, but not as heavy as anticipated. From there though, they really become powerful, with strong citric hop bitterness lasting throughout the finish and seemingly only increasing in power through the aftertaste. The aftertaste is remarkable in its staying power of the bitterness...the grapefruit bitterness lasts a very long time. If there's malt presence here, I just don't get it.  This is a seriously hoppy beer, as advertised and expected, and packs a ""wallop"" with the ABV. I understand that this isn't the most bitter beer on the market, but for a non-hophead like myself, it's definitely plenty bitter...especially in the aftertaste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

A pretty good alcohol kick, but not hot, thought I wouldn't try to do more than one.. Pretty nice balance. No 'wallop' to speak of, certainly not in the league of the hop bitchslap you get from Ruination, etc. Glad I tried it once, cant' be too parochial towards Left Coast IPAs, but frankly dear, I'd rather drink Pliny.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

The scent was a very subdued pine with maybe a hint of vanilla. The taste was more of a ""hop tap on the shoulder"" than a wallop to the palate.

There's hardly any hop presence.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Taste is heavy on grapefruit rind and pith with some hints of pine - very sticky, but not overly bitter. Slight toasted malt balances taste.

Moderate carbonation is noticed and no sediment.  The aroma is primarily that of hops with more citrus notes, than pine. There is also a strong component of sweetness.  The taste includes another healthy dose of hops, primarily citrus again, with grapfruit components. Just a brief glimpse of sweet malts present at the beginning and a nice bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Carbonation is good for the flavor. A pleasant dryness is present at the finish, all combined to make a smooth beverage.  Overall, this is a very good beer. There are areas for improvement but this can hold its own and compete with some of the better IPAs.

345,14916,bamadog,3.68,"Review is from notes - beer drank on 5/27/09 at Fries Cafe in Cincinnati, from the tap into a pint glass.  Appearance: Comes with a 1 finger head that afdes to a thin film on top; color is light coppery-yellow (a little paler than what I've seen in others DIPAs) and seems a little cloudy, but not overly so; thin ring of lacing at the top clings loosely to the sides of the glass; decent carbonation.  Smell: Not an overpowering nose at all; smells more malty than hoppy -- very sweet -- not to say that the hops aren't present, but they're a little subdued by the malts and come across a little citrusy.  Taste: Much like the smell, really dominated by the malts as it's a little toasty and very sweet on the palate (I think I even made the joke that it should be called Malt Wallop as opposed to Hop Wallop - makes me wonder how old the keg may have been that was tapped?) yet it is still fairly balanced by the muted bittering effect from the hops; the bitterness doesn't seem to have a flavor that goes along with it (no pine, no citrus - at least I could pick it up in the nose a little bit); finish is a little metallic.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, a little creamy and fairly smooth; slightly prickly from the carbonation and this gives it a bit of liveliness; thin coating is left behind.  Drinkablity: I would say surprisingly high, but not one of the more impressive DIPAs that I've had. I could have sat through a couple more of these over the course of the evening (yes, it was a slightly long night out) but there were other options on tap that were much more enticing, so I wish I could give this score an asterisk.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

T - Initial sweetness of pale malts and honey, immediately overrun by hops. Delicious grapefruity hops. A touch of earthy hops. All in lovely balance with a final touch of alcohol spice in the finish.  M - Crisp and light but full flavored. Very good carbonation levels, fits the beer quite well. Smooth.  D - Very drinkable, but the alcohol in the finish impedes a bit. Still delicious though.  Thoughts - A very good DIPA. My only complaint was that the nose was rather weak.

As the head settles it leaves behind a nice lacing on the sides of the glass.  The smell is pretty faint. A little piny hop note but also some boring bread smells come through.  The taste is nothing like the smell. Bitter hops hit the tongue right off the bat, followed by a piney taste that doesn't last long. After the pine there is a citrusy, floral hop character that leads to the bitter finish. The Citrus is very bold, but also very quick, an interesting flavor.  The beer is very well carbonated and feels great. It has a nice crispness to it that accompanies the bitterness well, something I could easily drink 6-8 of in a night.

This IPA tastes like citrus (more like orange) and finishes with plenty of hops, but not overwhelmingly.  M: The beer starts out with the orange flavor and then the hops slowly overtake the citrus in the end, leaving a bitter aftertaste (which is expected).  D: I like this, to be straightforward.

Bread-malty with a huge amount of hop bitterness on the finish. Orangey sweet hops complement the malt nicely. Bitterness lingers on your tongue forever. Slightly boozy as this warms. A tad off balance in that the hop bitterness is a bit much, but its not off by much.  Light-to-medium body on this one with great effervescent carbonation.

Its warm out and I'm refreshed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,rmaste6282,4.12,"Nice and clear honey color Double IPA from Victory, the head is small less than one finger. Smell has a piney/tar hop aroma, kind of earthy smelling. The taste is heavy on the bitter hops with that pine/woody flavor, seems pretty highly carbonated even though it didn't have a huge head, steady malt backbone. Mouthfeel is carbonated, pretty bitter, with some other nuances of flavor that I haven't experienced in a double IPA. Drinkability is good, decent double IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,aubuc1,4.12,"22 oz bomber dated best before march 4, 2010 poured in to a shaker pint.  Pours a clear dark yellow/light amber with a thick sticky white head.  Big piney sweet smell and strong grapefruit.  Taste of smooth hop. bitter pine, but not as strong as the taste. Very nice.  Full mouthfeel and the good taste (not too bitter) keeps it easy drinking.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,carlborch,4.5,"Poured a rich gold with the slightest haze. The head set to a beautiful 2-inches of off-white persistent foam. As it settled and as I sipped,the lace was well developed. Wonderful nose of flavor hops, excellent mouth feel and a ""wallop"" of bittering hops. Walloping, but not overpowering! Sweet malty, caramel notes fill your mouth followed by the bitter cleansing and a very pleasant malty-hoppy lingering. This would be excellent with food but is perfect on its own for my older deteriorating palate. In other words, I like bitter brews.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Kadonny,4.17,"Poured from the new 22 ounce bomber bottle into my Sam Adams glass.  A: A clear golden color with a minimal one finger white head. Very light and clear for a DIPA.  S: Hops and hops. Earthy floral nose with a very sweet caramel smell.  T: Very hoppy ale? Yup. The taste on this beer is oh so unique I would love to know what blend of hops they use. Hops start with a massive herbal floral hop flavor mixed in with some citrus like grapefruit and orange. A bit of earth, but the flavors here are mostly light and fruity. I think I even pick up a hint of vanilla. A nice bready caramel sugary sweetness holds the beer together and a super bitter hoppy finish comes at the end. Bitterness really stays.  M: Prickly, hoppy, bitter with no alcohol. Even a bit dry.  D: High, uber high for a DIPA.  Overall I can't believe I never reviewed this from bottle, so I figured the new 22 ounce bottles was a great time to do it. A very solid DIPA that ranks just below the top notch DIPAs. Still, a great beer that I'm glad Victory is now making year round.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,IMincedTheKing,3.97,"Pours yellow-orange with a huge head. The color is a little lighter than I'd expect.  Pineapple and tangerine hops on the nose. Some maltiness in the background.  The flavor is spicy, piney, and hoppy with weak, but sweet, malts. It's a little thin and a bit oily with a touch of astringency in the finish.  Overall, a tasty, highly drinkable Imperial IPA, but definitely not my favorite.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,farrago,3.48,"Delicate cream white foam, under a finger and of mixed bubble sizes, above average stickiness to the lacing. A luminescent glow fattens the orange bronze color, lightens to a metallic yellow around the rims, gauzy transparency throughout. Doughy to lightly cooked bread infused nose, sour lemon and orange rinds, pine and straw, not many fruit scents nor malt sweetness, hence has a blunt sort of aggressiveness to it, forces itself into your nostrils rather than settle into them. Full-bodied, dry and covers the tongue like a straightjacket. Sourdough, rye and even more sour lemon takes the stage first, the lowish carbonation doesn't relieve much of the bitter bite. Pine needles, rusted metal, minerals and general leafy qualities aren't giving you a moment to relax. Touch of pineapple to guava fruit. The malts cower in the shadows. Homogenous enough that the second half of the bomber becomes sort of a chore to throw back.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Brenden,4.23,"The color is a very gently hazy golden amber. The head is nice and compact, leaving some thick rings of lacing down the glass. The aroma is extremely citrusy, primarily grapefruit, orange peel and perhaps a lemon bite. Following is the suggestion of pine and an extremely subtle underlying hint of something sweet. Mostly, though, fresh citrus, leaf and earth is on the nose. This is what I expect from an IIPA. A great bitterness up front with fresh grapefruit is complimented by a nice complexity of citrus flavors and a great malt backing. Pine is also present and there's a very subtle toasty/biscuity layer there as well. This one lingers on the palate and keeps hitting with more and more complexity after the swallow. The carbonation is a little light so this one's creamier, but I also got a nice crispness to mine and of the bottles a couple of my friends tried seemed the same to them. I suppose a little more crispness and just a bit more carbonation bite would have pushed this up even higher. Everyone who loves IIPAs must try this, and those who want to know what it should be need to have this as one of their first.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,bryanbrick,4.43,"Dated with a ""Drink by Feb. 9th, 2010  Great head which persists all the way through the life of beer before I eagerly drink it. Always willing to kick back up with a little swirling agitation. Plus a bunch of rings of lacing all way down glass. This dosen't have the hugely appealing pine needle/tropical fruit smell I expected from it. It is way more subdued and subtle with a nice vanilla bean note and some freshly split pine logs. Mild but likeable. Wish this was a bit more forward and aggressive in this department.  But that is really the only flaw I can see in this beer. The flavors are perfectly balanced and delicious. Mildly bitter, earthy underbrush, sage and bitter greens (rapini?). This is long and lasting and full of flavor without being a palate buster.  This is a bit creamy for my like of the style but that makes it a bit more interesting and drinkable. I'd like to see a bit more carbonation to give this a bite that it lacks.  But overall this is wildly drinkable and completley delicious.

Looks hazy, either from being chilled or maybe the level of filtering  Wonderful smell of pineapple and watermelon or honeydew. Promising. Seems more like a cloudy pilsner but maybe taste will tell.  Big round bitterness. Medicinal. Tastes like someone over pelleted something at first but the smoothness withe the malt gives it support. Very long bitter finish, it's been a while since I've had one that has this length to it. Has a subtle bread flavor, seemingly Belgian. A bit chewy.  The bitterness is just too long for me to enjoy as is stand alone. It's like I'm drinking a double expresso.  It's pretty good but I really need a spicy treat with this one. Or maybe something sweet, like a fruit tart.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,alcstradamus,4,"A--Awesome glowing orange/amber color with a fluffy one finger head in my Dogfish Head signature glass (snifter). The head camps for a bit and leaves a nice wall of lacing.  S--Big citrus hop nose...pineapple, orange, watermelon?? Perfect scent but not quite as strong as I would hope for a DIPA  T--Malts come at first and for a brief moment it appears that the hops are going to take a backseat, but as it washes down there is a stinging bitterness that creeps back up. Bit of a pine resin aftertaste, the citrus quality is still present but not at the forefront. Solid tasting brew, not really a stand out but enjoyable for sure.  M--On the thin side of medium bodied, stinging carbonation. Washes down clean except for the lingering bitterness.  D--This beer was interesting.

Big, wet hops come roaring back at the finish, leaving a pleasant, lingering bitterness that begs for another sip. And ""sip"" you should because this is a very drinkable beer for the strength(8.5ABV).I had to consciously slow down as I was grilling some burgers while having a couple of these tasty brews.

345,14916,chaz410,3.76,Got this on Tap from Flying Saucer in Charlotte NC. Appearance was very light orangish yellowed body. Has a great foamy thick white head with lots of good steady carbonation. Smell was a little tart and full of floral hops. Grassy notes and not much malt profile. Taste is intense. One sip goes a long way with this beer. Initially the taste is fruity and slightly malty with zests of lemon almost like a typical summer ale. The lemon essence pusches into the fruity hop overload and pulls in grassy hops and some grapefruit as well. Finishes bitter and little piney and tart. Even the afterbreath brings a different set of bittering and warming hop and alcohol flavor. Mouthfeel is very sharp after the initial smooth character. Drinkability on this beer is selective to hop heads.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Also what I would describe as a cat piss smell.  Taste was grassy, wheat and some citrus with what another reviewer said best ""farmhouse, horse funk"". Good bitter hops.  Not terrible but that ""farmhouse, horse funk"" is something I could do without. Really took away from this brew for me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Nose is eathy, grassy, malty and note quite as pungent as a garden variety IPA. Flavor is decidedly on the bitter side with some hints of pineapple and malt. Finishes a bit dry and with certain notes that suggest a higher IBU than the nose would suggest.

Lemon, orange, grapefruit, dominate the aroma. Orange, grapefruit with some lemon on the finish, virtually no malt backbone to speak of. Moderate in both mouthfeel and carbonation. Fairly drinkable considering the bitterness and ABV. Definitely hop-forward, as expected, but with virtually no malt flavor to speak of.

345,14916,Gosox8787,4.62,"Picked up a six pack at my local store. This is the first product by Victory I have had or reviewed, although I have had many beers of this style.  Poured from the bottle into my friends Sam Adams Sensory Glass. The beer was golden to light amber with a two finger, cloudy white head and good retention. The aroma was filled with citrus notes from the hops. A little pine was also present. The taste was similiar to the smell, citrus and pine hops anchored the brew. The hops were not overly bitter as there was a nice sweetness to the brew. The mouthfeel was dry and sticky, with a little carbonation to offer a nice bite. Drinkability is pretty good considering the style. I can have a couple of these and be completely satisfied.  Overall, a great DIPA that I would certainly recommend. Offers great flavor, is affordable and is a solid all around brew. Positively recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Almost dirty straw color. Very clear. Looks more BMCish than expected.  Smell - Very nice hops up front. Some good grapefruit and citrus. Touch of candied malt behind it. Mostly those sweet hops with a touch of the pine. Smells good.  Taste - Yum. Nice sharp grapefruit hops. Some real bread yeastiness as well. Almost sweet, but then the hoppy citrus bitterness on the follow. Pretty tasty, but seems to be lacking that extra layer the great ones have.  Mouthfeel - A touch thin, although the beer lingers nicely. Maybe a hint more carbonation would do the trick.  Drinkability - Pretty nice. A hoppy beer that isn't a palate destroyer. I'd have another.  This is a very nice, solid beer. Reminds me of Torpedo in the ""a real solid strong IPA/DIPA that I'd happily keep on hand"" range. Certainly up there with the biggies, but a good beverage to have around. Also won't break the bank. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a hoppy one.

The farmhouse, horse funk is in there, and it's not a bad thing.  M - Perfect! Nice and thick, with low to moderate carbonation. The sip begins with a lucious, hop flavor and ends with a nice drying alcohol bitterness. There is a touch of malt that hits the back on the tongue, but for the most part, this is a full on hop bomb.  D - Easy cowboy. Even though this beer is easy drinking, it packs a serious punch.

Leaves lacing down the glass.  S - Extreme citrus hops. Almost no malt character present. No alcohol either despite the ABV.  T - This is all about the hops. The malt sweetness tastes like simple and inoffensive malt syrup in the background. The rest is pure hop character. Each sip starts off sweet, and is followed up by huge citrus hops with some pine/resin notes. Fades to a lingering bitterness in the aftertaste.

To me it was not overly bitter, but the hop presence is very strong. A lot of citrus is evident in this brew, more orange than grapefruit. There is some malty flavor. Although this was somewhat mellow, it was very abundant with flavor.  Mouthfeel is interesting. Very tingly, and smooth. Crisp and refreshing. Nice carbonation.

It had a drink by date on the front and it poured a light tan/orange color with a 3 finger foam head with some solid lacing.  It had citrusy and piney smells to it. The taste was heavily malty base with a flavor extension that leads it to the end. It was moderately carbonated with an odd flavor to begin with. Since it is 8.5 it warms the belly pretty quickly.

It has excellent balance D - Can't give it too high of a score here as it isn't very sessionable due to the ABV and the bitter factor which is large and in charge for this one.

The color was a rich, gold, such as Croesus might have had between his fingers. The clarity was phenomenal - well beyond NE-quality, allowing me to peer across the room and nearly through the wall, x-ray spex style. The nose was of freshly-squeezed Florida grapefruit on a huge scale. The mouthfeel was silky smooth, running down my gullet slick as a whistle. The hops were more muted than the in-your-face, mofo! taste that I have experienced in its CO2 draft version. I really liked the citrusy play on my tongue. It tickled! No, really, it scrubbed my palate clean and opened my heretofore stuffy sinuses. The finish was muted, compared to the CO2 version, but it had a pleasant citrusy aftertaste. Yum!  Wow! My original review was clearly from a Cask. I now have a Bottle (!) that I would like to drink, review & rate. Today is Sa, 25 April 2020 & I am still in quarantine.  From the Bottle: ""A Victory for Your Taste""; ""Citra and Simcoe Hops impart Fruity and Earthy Notes for a new twist on a flavorful friend. This IPA packs a hoppy wallop.""; ""Brewmasters' Approval: [undersigned] Bill & Ron"".  I Pop!ped the cap & started a slow, gentle C-Line pour into the awaiting glass. I then wool-gathered for a moment, reflecting on my firs meeting with those guys & how far all of us have come. While I did so, it pulled a Sneaky Pete on me & formed two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head with better retention than I deserved for taking my eye off of the ball. I suddenly snapped back to reality in time to see the trail of sticky lacing that it had left for me. Color was a gorgeous Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality & so I was joined by The Gelt Gang of Midas, Mammon & Croesus, all clamoring for a taste! OMFG. How did a simple re-review escalate like this?!? Nose had little Simcoe, the naughty kitten's catty business sprayed all over it! 8=O Oh, she's a wicked little devil. Mouthfeel was medium, about on par for the AIPA style. The taste had a grapefruit citrusiness along with an earthy tang. Very nice. Finish was dry with Simcoe's cattiness returning & in no small way!

345,14916,Vonerichs,3.95,"Clear pale orange with a decent head. There's a pretty heavy lacing from top to bottom which is the most impressive part, visually.  Obviously with a name like Hop Wallop the hops are the most noticable, and are of the floral/grassy variety. There is also a citrus present, but not the bitter citrus I'd expect. It's more of a sweet and tropical smell almost like pineapple and a little bit of mango. It is faint and took me a minute to pinpoint, but after I did it became much more present every sniff.  I really enjoy the taste, it's a fun beer. It has a great hop presence that is followed by the sweet citrus flavors that are present in the smell. The bitterness stands out more in the nose but fades within seconds. There is also a slight yeast presence in the middle. Overall, this has a variety of very different flavors present that creates a unique flavor for IIPA.  The mouthfeel is the only ""knock"" I have on Hop Wallop. I've had this beer a few times now, each time purchasing a sixer and being cognizant of the freshness date so it's not a consistancy issue or a matter of an old batch. It always seems a little flat to me. The carbonation is light and it feels sticky in the mouth. Not bad, but it's not as crisp as I'd like it to be nor is the finish as dry as I prefer.  Very tastey and the abv is masked extremely well. It's an enjoyable beer and now that this is available all year round I'd definitely say this is a ""go to"" when I'm in the mood for a double and the seasonals aren't around.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

A lot of my enjoyment of a beer is from visual appeal and this looks like a lager. Yuck. Beautiful head, however, and great rings of lace with every sip.  The smell and taste are phenomenal. The best of more than 40 beers I've had, so far, this year. As the glass approaches the mouth, there is a wave of freshly cut grass that hits the nose. The flavor begins like fresh grass, and as the beer warms, a more citrusy flavor dominates. A fabulous bitterness stays on the tongue, making sure that it, and I, know that we are alive.  Hop Wallop transcends the simple pleasures of drinking. It invoked, in me, the feeling of sitting on a perfectly manicured lawn overlooking the ocean on a glorious day.  The smell and flavor of this beer are an experience akin to seizing the day. I highly recommend Hop Wallop.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BirdFlu,4.02,"A very fruity hop character overall for this.. The smell is quite fruity, while hoppy. Not just grapefruit, but apple and pineapple as well, though not as strong of an aroma as many DIPAs. Pours a copper orange with foamy white head, typical of the style. Flavor has a lot of deep tones, with an obviously prominent hop character. The hop character isnt too assertive or astringently bitter, though. Mouth is full-feeling, well rounded. A bit heavier than many IPA's (it is a double, I guess). Has the taste of an IPA, but the feel of a DIPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BeerMark,3.35,"Purchased at Green's(Atlanta) Buford Hyw. Pale yellow in color. Leaves lacing on the glass. Smells very hoppy but that's what I expect. The taste is... very hoppy and there is no surprise here. I kinda feel like I've been walloped on the noggin. I like hops as well as the next guy, but hops are the only thing this beer offers. I like a balanced beer with malt and hops sharing the stage. If you are looking only for hops then you may have found your beer. If you desire something a little more complex, then look elsewhere.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,mjw06,3.88,"very faint, transparent, golden rose color with a one finger size head that dissipates slowly and leaves a great lacing.  smell was sweet and florally. good, but not that impressive.  the hops are of great taste. no funny finish or aftertaste here, something that you often find in other beers trying to ""wallop"" you with hops. bitterness is consistent, smooth, and cooperative with the feel. it hits as soon as it touches your tongue and mildly increases as it reaches the back until it finishes off smooth. very florally with a hint of citrus and sweetness. the taste packs much more character that what the smell represents.  great light body with minimal carbonation that doesnt really make itself felt until it hits the back of the mouth.  a good beer, though i have been matched with others in this style that were much more complex, interesting, and pleasing. would def have another however, drinkable with mild imperfections.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Shumista,3.82,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A- Looks like beer. Really not much to say here, it pours a light golden color with an off white head. S- Smells pretty good. Grassy hops and biscuity malt. T- Grassy and biscuity. Not as flavorful as I expect for a DIPA. M- Medium bodied. D- Very high for a DIPA, I could drink a few of these without any trouble.  my bottom line: As DIPAs go Hop wallop is no Hopslam. Barely a DIPA in my opinion, more of an extra IPA like SN describes their Torpedo IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Martin2D,4.06,"A - Golden yellow with a large white head  S - Weak aroma, can't perceive much  T - Rich malts on forefront followed by a strong hop flavor. Balance of hope bitterness with a slight citrus flavor.  M - Medium carbonation and body  D - Very drinkable. The malt and hop balance is spot on. The appearance is misleading, as it is very light even for a IIPA.

345,14916,Docer,3.85,"Grabbed a single 12oz. bottle at the 55th Burnside QFC here in Portland.. Best by Dec. 09..  - Lighter color than the Hop Devil I just had before this.. more yellow, more clear.. great head.. very white, frothy.. and creamy.. excellent lacing. From this and the devil.. I am impressed by the head from this brewer.  - At opening time over the bottle... a skunk hop aroma.. which I actually really like. Up close is a very skunky hop scent which I can also almost pick out a roasted caramel malt scent as well... smells like an A+ Rainier Ale.. lol..  - Very different from anything else I have had... and much like Rainier Ale in flavor... almost like a malt liquor/hop bomb combo pack... rather creamy, skunky.. bit bitter, but almost balanced but not by a unique malt presence.. just too different to describe well.  - Bit bitter and dry.. chewy and resiny.. oily too... but it should be for what it is!  - Quite drinkable... but only a few.. this is a strong one, hides the alcohol very well... and will get you twisted like a malt liquor if you are not careful.  Overall I am dumbfounded by this brew... it is great quality, and strong... and reminds me of my younger days drinking 40's of Rainier Ale. A skunky hop bomb it is.. and rather creamy.

345,14916,markskar,4.95,"Yee-haw!!! Gold!!! Eureka!!! No wonder the label features a old prospector-looking fellow. Alas, it seems that I tend to review mostly beers I love, so my ratings are often high, but this one gets a near-perfect rating in my book.  A: 24K, Luminescent Gold. Crystal clear. Nice two finger head with amazing lacing for something with such a high level of clarity. No chill haze whatsoever.  S: Wonderful citrusy. Outstanding display of west coast hop aroma. Can't detect any indication of the high abv (8.5%) due to the overwhelmingly pleasant bouquet of glorious American hops (wtf did they use, Cascade? Chinook?? Yakima??? Poster below says Centennial, but there must be more to it...I need to know damn it!!!).  T: Delicious light malts and a boatload of hops. This wonderful ale is not ""over-hopped"", however, as it is well balanced with a high abv% that is barely detectable behind the stunning hop flavor.  M: Heady and dry, with a nice, lingering hop tingle. The FG must be quite low, as it could certainly be a little bit smoother on the palate, but I really can't complain about the end result here. Doesn't burn the tongue, but stings just enough to make sure you remember it.  D: See above. I've always had trouble with this category unless dealing with a thick brew (like a porter or stout), or a brew that's total crap. I love this stuff, could drink it 'til I pass out, but that is not the goal here. It's as drinkable as possible, unless you over-do it and end up in a blacked out drunken stupor. That's personal choice, however, so I have to give it a perfect 5 for drinkability as a Strong Ale (or DIPA, or American Barleywine, or whatever they want to call it--doesn't matter to me so long as they keep making it).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,1fastz28,4.7,"This beer is kinda unique for an IPA, atleast i think so. For one the color is somewhat pale and not hazy at all. It has a light golden color and a nice big white head and a decent lacing. Smell is good but not overly strong, many Ipas, especially DIPA's have an aroma that will slap you in the face. The taste, mouthfeel and drinkability are all incredible, its a wonderful blend of hops and just a slight maltiness. mouthfeel is full and rich, not watery. a very good DIPA. dont know why i waited so long to try it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

A wonderful sticky ring of foam formed at the top displaying an inverted city skyline as my sips continued  S: a basketful of stinky hops! Spicy pine, grapefruit, oranges, lemons, and pineapples. This one is intense! Need I say anymore...  T: the hop flavor is wonderfully overpowering. My glass holds a beer thats very existence is a contradiction. The hops have an amazing balance, they are given plenty of room to shine (a bunch) and yet are harnessed without being a overly bitter-hop-snap-bomb. The amalgamation of hop flavors range from tropical, piney, citrus, and a few twists of fresh ground peppercorns! A wicked bad beer...my goodness  M: another huge asset is the beer has a great sweetness that makes it delicately sticky, smooth, and creamy in the mouth and finish  D: this brew gave my tounge a worthwhile beating and worked over time.

345,14916,lordofthewiens,4.03,"This well-reviewed beer was eagerly anticipated. I've enjoyed all of the Victory beers that I can get here in Maine. In a tulip glass, the beer was a clear golden color with a thick white head that left plenty of lacing. Strong floral/pine aroma. I could only taste pine, with a little bit of sweetness. Nice lingering bitterness. This was a fine beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,JonMich13,4.2,"Bottle from Total Wine poured into pint glass. After my experience with HopDevil and Storm King, am highly anticipating anything I get from Victory.  A = Nice golden amber with two fingers of frothy white head. Webbie lacing all the way down.  S = Very uplifting floral and citrus smell.  T = An ever fleeting sweet malt tries to show itself up front, but the hop army comes along quick and hard and dominates any feeble attempt by the malt. The floral and citrus hops however do not cross the line into insanity. The bitter is present but palatable, only lingering mildly. Alcohol stays hidden. It's hard for a double to be balanced in the Webster's sense. So balance for me is just enough malt to keep the hops from taking control of my brain. This one has it.  M = Excellent sticky hop mouthfeel, medium body. Mild to moderate carbonation.  D = Well hidden ABV and restrained bitterness makes this a fairly easy drinker.  IMO, Victory is one of the most underrated brewers out there. These are some true artisans of beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

S - Lots of floral hoppyness with a slightly dirty backing. Piney and fresh with little malt on the nose.  T - Actually tasted a bit more bitter than other DIPAs like Hopslam, with a less powerful hop punch. Still quite hoppy and florally aromatic with a sweet & bitter grapefruit taste as well. (Thanks to my cousin for picking out the grapefruit)  M - An interesting light yet slightly syrupy feel. The hop resin was fairly biting, but the carbonation and the light body held it together well.  D - I shared the bottle with my cousin, but I could have easily had a whole one myself, though I don't know if I'd want to have more than one.  overall - If my IPA-averse cousin liked it, it's gotta be doing something right, no?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,sprucetip,4.01,"Bottle into goblet. Pours golden, clear with fluffy white frothy head, thick lacing and good retention. SMELL is pleasant but not strong. Hay, straw, floral and earthy hops gently, grainy and malty. Some sweetness. Tea like. Just not all that potent. Even with swirling, the nose remained enjoyable but hard to find. TASTE is rich malty sweetness blending and battling with deep but tempered hop bitterness, with some light citrus notes sneaking in later. Some bready graininess in the body. Imld drying and lingering bitterness. Slight hint of booze. Nice. Smooth and balanced overall, but the hoppy bite seems to have a cumulative effect and be much stronger by the end. FEEL medium carb, thick, rich, full body and texture. Dryness in the bitter finish that lingers. OVERALL too good not to savor, and big bold body encourages moderation. Yes this is so tasty that multiples cannot be ruled out.

345,14916,iamntbatman,4.3,"Appearance: Light yellow to gold with a short, but thick head. This is a very hazy beer, even for an IPA, with very good lacing all the way down the glass.  Smell: Hops, hops hops. Every aspect of that typical American hops flavor is well represented here. The malt is very subtle. The alcohol isn't anywhere to be found.  Taste: Absolutely great! It's like the IPA equivalent of hearing a very loud metal band from another room and through a wall: you pick up every bit of the aggressive florals, citrus, pine and bitterness but all are muted a bit by the cask. They're definitely present here though, and make up the vast majority of the flavor profile. The malt is discernible but doesn't play a major part.  Mouthfeel: Quite creamy due to the cask. Very low carbonation but also has minimal typical IPA stickiness. Different, but I like it.  Drinkability: The cask makes this *very* drinkable for a DIPA. This one could definitely sneak up on you with its quite well-hidden 8.5% ABV.  In case I didn't make it clear enough, this beer is a whole different animal on cask than in the bottle or on tap. However good this was, it definitely takes away from the ""wallop"" this beer usually has. I can't recommend it enough, but in a ""desert island"" scenario I would stick with the stronger flavor of the standard bottled Hop Wallop.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Sweet malt and some light caramel. Pepper and slight clove from the yeast.  T - Sweet malt with lots of toast and biscuit character. Floral hops in the middle with pineapple notes. Spicy hop bitterness in the finish with some tobacco and slight astringency.  M - Thick, creamy body, moderate carbonation, and a slightly sweet, astringent finish.  D - Great hop character in the aroma, though the flavor is somewhat weaker and the balance is a little off in the finish.

345,14916,ThatWineGuy,4.17,"Hazy gold with orange hilights, half finger off white head faded out but was easily regenerated with a swirl. Solid ring, wispy centre persisted as did the evidence of carbonation that lazily but continually drifted upwards. Nose was sweet with fuzzy peach and passionfruit. Taste is very much grapefruit and a sour hoppiness predominates. The 8.5 per cent ABV is cleverly hidden, finish is earthy, and extremely dry. So hoppy sour at times and so bitter dry that it seems to parch the throat, just a bit rough around the edges. But if you love wild hops, lasso some of this stuff and you'll get your fix. I just wish I could get this fix more often here in Ontario.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

This is a bitter one, but there's a lot of good hop flavor to back it up. Not nearly as malty or dark as some imperial IPAs, but there is some sweetness there, kind of honey-like. Medicinal and piney hops dominate the palate. Really bitter aftertaste. Very good, slippery mouthfeel, with low carbonation. Extremely drinkable for 8.5%.

345,14916,erikm25,4.1,A: Pours a hazy golden orange. Head is a medium off white dense cap of bubble. Retention is very good. Pointy lacing clings to the glass like a Seurat painting. A sludgy honey as it finally rests in the glass.  S: Emerald hops. Massive juiced lemons and saccharine tipped flowers. Orange and apple juices mixed together with a gaggle of grapefruit and grass. Pineapple and pine trees. Berried spices.  T: This is a blast of hops. Big orange tang and tangerine bite. Mango spiced rye and burnt pined grapefruits. As to be expected there is no real balance or complexity here just blistering hops. Medicinal and herbal zests.  M: Decent medium mouth feel. Moderate carbonation.  D: There are two types of green gold and hoppy beer is one. I have not tried a lot from this brewery but this impressed me. We all know that the Miller Lite beer from the constant ads during the 2009 NCAA Tournament would lay neutered and slain from this mighty hops sword.

Than came the surprise: No real aroma whatsoever. I was expecting floral hops and got nothing. No hops, not even really any malt. Very strange.  Taste is all hops bitterness. Not that that's a bad thing, but it's definitely not for everyone. They must put all the hops in at the beginning of the boil. Not much hops flavor and, once again, no aroma.  Did I mention that this was bitter? The bitterness sticks to the back of your tongue for a long time. It will affect your perception of other food and drink for a while. Had one as a before-dinner beer and then the first glass of the zinfandel that my wife and I had with our steak actually tasted a lot sweeter than it really was.  I enjoyed it, but at this ABV and bitterness, it's not a beer that you'll drink more than two.

Lacing is left on the inside of the glass with each sip. Smells and tastes of skunky, sticky, piney resinous hops. Should I drink it or smoke it? I'll drink it, cuz it drinks pretty good for an 8.5% beer. Alcohol is barely noticeable. Bitterness is never overpowering, for me at least. DD - dangerously drinkable.

A strong lasting taste of hops with a slightly oily mouth feel. This is a sipping beer and a after having a couple of these the ABV could probably sneak up on you. A good beer to have on a cool day.  Definitely one of my favorites.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Taste is bitter citrus hops with a bit more depth than most. The malts are clean and lend just enough support to make this very drinkable. Watch out for the alcohol though as it is well hidden. I am nearing the finish of this tasty 12 ounce beer and am feeling no pain. Not a session beer due to the overall effects. Nice beer though. Dry bitter finish.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,chiefydawg,4.28,"Rather clear light golden color with mild fizz sustaining a nice dense white head. Great lacing grips the glass.  Citrus rind and pine needles fill the nose, barely tempered by some dry biscuit, cracker scent.  Oh my it is hoppy! In flavor and bitterness, but never harsh. Rindy yet juicy, this makes your mouth water and your tongue tingle. There is a faint fresh bagel and husky grain character that tries in vain to keep the hops at bay. It is a nice addition and a valiant effort, but not a match whatsoever. The Wallop of hops just pummels all who attempt to intervene. These hops however, do aid in ushering in the clinical, warm and sterile cleansing of grain alcohol. Almost numbing for 8.5%, it tandems with the hops to dominate all other tastes. But wait - there's this guerrilla warfare rebellion uprising of grain...  Overall, this beer did what it is supposed to IMO for a DIPA. Not as heavy and cumbersome as many, I think it could be mistaken at first for a strong IPA. But like the heavyweight boxer it is, it starts off light-footed and soon begins laying its weight on you.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ColForbinBC,4.4,"On cask at the brewery  Appears a hazy, staw color with amber highlights. The creamy paper white cap sits like cool whip on top of the body. Beautiful.  Aroma is of pine needles, grapefruits, tangerines, lemons, biscuit, and a tad bit of caramel. I think the cask brings more out on the aroma side of things.  Flavor mimics the nose only a honey like sweetness emerges to counteract the citrus rind and pine needle flavor. Finish is bitter and dry. Just the way I like it.  Full, rich and creamy, almost too creamy.  Drinkability is good. Not great. It is a rich and creamy beer and really knocks you over the head with the bitterness. A nice, slow interaction is necessary to fully enjoy it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,BeardedBoffin,3.6,"The beer emerged from the bottle a hazy dirty golden color with a big head that left decent lacing down the glass. The aroma was a little lighter than I expected for the style, but it was pleasant nonetheless with pine and floral hops and just a little bit of biscuit malt. Medium bodied and almost a little oily as it raced across the palate. There is a fleeting maltiness just as the beer kisses the palate, but it is quickly steamrolled by a wallop of hops. Bitter, floral, and pine are all wrapped into this hoppy assault, leaving a lasting bitterness on the tongue. A mild warmness in the chest heralds the alcohol in this beer.

Appearance: Pours a clear, light golden body with a thin, short-lived, white head.  Smell: Meager maltiness dressed with hop scents of lemon, grilled pineapple rings, and pine.  Taste: Solid, sweet maltiness (though not exactly overabundant) initially. Sweetish blend of pine resin, lemon juice, and pineapple hop flavors. Medium-high bitterness. Chunks of white peach emerge upon warming. Flourishing, lasting spiciness. Finishes dry and bittersweet with just a bit of alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel: Just a smidge above medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Very light stickiness on the mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Dagnabbit, now I'm curious to know if I snatched up an old bottle or not as it just didn't deliver the wallop I was hoping and waiting for. Personally, I'd prefer a HopSlam. In fact... that's not a bad idea.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Explosion of hops. all citrus in the front with an incredible bitterness in the finish. Way hoppy and intense with no balance at all. Mouthfeel has a good chewiness to it, but is somewhat flat for that amount of hops. Drinkability suffers from the amount of hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

A different piney hoppy smell,also hints of orange and a nice sweet malt smell. A nice sweet malty taste much like the smell.With a dry grapefruit aftertaste.With the ABV being 8.5 this is a very drinkable beer.

345,14916,BrewerB,3.46,"Cheers to AdamB84 for the hookup on this beer! According to the bottle, this is about a month past its prime.  A - Poured into my Firestone Walker Nonic pint glass. Light golden amber color, great headstand and lacing. Slightly hazy. Off-white head.  S - Initial grass notes faded a bit and gave way to a citrusy hop kick. Not as intense as it should be. Perhaps a factor of age. Clean malt bill. Slight alcohol spice.  T - Having trouble picking up on specific hop flavors. Slight grassiness. Initially sweet, the moderate level of bitterness seems an afterthought, noticeable more in the finish and aftertaste. Alcohol noticed after belching. The flavor just doesn't seem like a DIPA. Lacking the intensity and complexity that it needs.  M - Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Smooth.  D - If I had a 12 pack of this, I could probably make it halfway though. But the true test of drinkability would pit this beer against others in my cabinets, fridge, or at the bar I'm drinking at. Truthfully, if I had other beers to choose, I'd not have a second of this.

An aggressive pour produces a little more than one finger of eggshell white head that retains well and leaves tons of thick lacing.  A: Lemon, orange peel, citrus hops, and wheat. The initial wiff gives me an almost wheat beer smell, I swear this smells almost like Oberon with a little more aggressive hop profile.  T: Very nice citrus hops, some pine, and caramel. The sweet malts are nice, but the hops shine through.  M: Medium body, but a bit more thin than what I was expecting. I get a little more of a tingle from the carbonation than a traditional DIPA.  D: Very drinkable considering the 8.5% abv. The alcohol is almost completly hidden. All and all, I was a little dissapointed with this brew.

A nice floral bouquet, along with some caramel and some citrus.  Some piney bitterness upfront, some orange peel, and some sweetness as it progresses along the tongue. The underlying sweetness is very noticeable if you search for it. I'm getting tastes of caramel, plums, and cherries. The malt backbone creates a nice balance with the hops. A bit dry and grassy in the finish  Nice creamy mouthfeel and a bit prickly on the tongue. Right amount of carbonation. Slightly watery upfront.  Absolutely delicious.

S: Strong, piney hop aroma with subtler grass notes. Some booze. A resiny soapy character. Some sweet malt in the background - but not pronounced.  T: Piney and grapefruit. This beer doesn't pop like I was expecting. Nice rounded bitterness that pulls through the entire sip. Grapefruit character starts popping as beer warms up . Good malt flavors add needed balance.  MF: Smooth medium body. Lightly carbonated. Soapy. Some alcohol warming but this one is on the lower end of the ABV spectrum for a double IPA.

There are some subtle aromatic notes that flucuate between raisin and cocoanut. Upon initial sip, there is an intense blast of hoppy grapefruit upon the palate. Interesting.  One other interesting aspect is how well balanced and smooth it is; this makes for a truly wonderful mouthfeel - hence the above rating. Victory Hop Wallop is a monumental hop bomb to be savored.

345,14916,pokesbeerdude,4.07,"From notes, 2/2009  Picked up a 12 oz single at Wilburs in Ft. Collins, about 2.30 a piece.  A: Poured a light pale gold color with a stark white head about half an inch thick. Crystal clear, not a lot of lacing. Pretty light in color for a DIPA. Head receded to a film.  S: Spicy/grassy hops, and a faint hint at a pale malt, hops dominate this one, as the name would suggest, slightly earthy, strong hop aroma. Smells pretty tasty. Somewhat offsetting mold/rotten gym bag smell that I've noticed in other Victory beers. Not terribly strong, but definitely noticeable.  T: Initally malt hit, pale malts, somewhat sweet, bitterness is way in the back, hops are subdued, but piney and earthy, slight bit of citrus rind too. Grassy, grapefruit peel. Really not as impressive as I had hoped. Still tasty. But somewhat disappointing.  M: Nice maltiness which leads to a somewhat thick beer, nice carbonation and nice alcohol, with enough hop bite to start a little bit of a pucker.  D: The most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. Somewhat, dare I say, chuggable? I honestly don't see what all the hype is, its a good DIPA, but there are a lot more better DIPA's. The beer would be a good stepping off point for anybody looking to move on beyond an IPA. But really it lacks a lot. Pretty overrated in my opinion. Not a bad beer, but a little on the weak side.

There was a nice spiciness to the hop them in the taste that made this beer stand out a little. I liked that part of it very much. This was pretty drinkable and all and all a pretty darn good effort. Probably gets unfairly knocked for being tasted on the same night that I had a HopSlam from Bells and Double Trouble from Founders. This beer is perfectly adequate, even better then that.

Body is quite light for even an IPA, never mind a IIPA - a translucent orange, brass. 1/2 finger white head, with okay retention. Lacing however, is quite radical - really sticking to the sides of the glass quite nicely. On account that this is so different, I give it a serious nod of approval. Nose at first is all about the hops, but very clean. Hops favor the piney earthy side. With some effort, sweet bready malts do emerge in the nose.  I suggest you let this brew sit and aerate a bit, as up front is very strong bitter hops. Flavor thus balances a bit, starting with notes of sweetness, but really quickly becoming predominantly bitter. Flavors are quite dense and resiny - like munching on thick grass. The beer really envelopes the mouth, tingly, and sticky.  I appreciate, but don't dig this beer too much.

Finish has a yeasty twinge and slight alcohol. I wonder what kind of hops they use in this beer because to me it comes off more like a Belgian IPA than an American IIPA.  Mouthfeel: Nice, not overwhelming.  Drinkability: This is where I think this beer shines. 8.5% ABV isn't that high consider what most other IIPA's weigh in at, and it still has very full flavor.

Bitter hops up-front with caramel and orange notes that lingered on my palet. Each sip made me rush to take another.  The mouthfeel seemed very rich and velvety for a beer that had a short lasting head and was relatively benign in color, but it coated the tongue and gave the impression of a beer much thicker than was the case.

Smells of citrus. Tastes moderately of citrus, not quite like a west coast hop bomb, but respectable nonetheless. Carbonation might be a tad less than I prefer, but like I said, I poured this one pretty aggressively, so it might be my fault. A solid middle-of-the-road DIPA, not a hop bomb, but a fine beer.

Not that I am complaining. I had a HopSlam earlier in the evening and they are very different. The front is sweet malt influenced grapefruit and the back is more of a floral with a strong piney bite that lasts well into the aftertaste. There's a hint of soapiness but not in a bad way. It's a ""no messin' around"" type beer. I think it is meant to be explicit in it's delivery of hopness. Pretty darned good in my book! The alcohol is pretty well masked. It sneaks in here and there.  M: The light side of medium bodied. The bite and medium carbonation deliver a nice thirst quenching dry crispness. D: I like this beer a great deal.

The taste starts off with a super duper hop bang and a dose of alcohol. Malts,grapefruit and citrus hints.  There is a lingering feel of mild bitterness that hangs around for a bit and what I liked most was that this beer was well balanced with good medium carbonation and body. Semi dry finish.  Notes: A wallop I am willing to take as this was well received and easy enough to drink.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,markaberrant,3.61,"A - deep golden with a hint of orange, brilliant clarity, delicate white head, lots of carbonation leisurely moving along, excellent lacing left behind.  S - fresh citrus and herbs, smells like they used some noble hops (website says 100% American whole hops, so probably some sort of hybrid like Mt Hood or Liberty) along with american c-types,, lemony, light malt sweetness, not a huge bouquet  T - more of that herbal, lemon rind flavour (sorta dirt-like too), turns rather sharp in the finish, soft malt sweetness for balance, lots of bitterness to match, very clean flavours  M - creamy smooth, light enough to not way things down, but still firm, med carbonation, noticable alcohol warmth does not offend, dry finish.  D - this is ok, and certainly a different approach to an IPA, but the combo of hops just doesn't work for me.  I've tasted IPAs that blend in noble hops, and it can work very well, but this one results in that dirt taste. It's not a drain pour, but it's not really a beer I would seek out in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,dqderrick,4.27,"A It looks like a lighter IPA. The color is a lighter orange/brown. Head is light, but I poured easy. Lacing is strong.  S Stinky sweek hops. Oh my. Great smell. I am a sucker for IPA's that have a bitter sweet smell. It makes me think of Blind Pig. But this smell adds a little spice... I'm not sure what.  T Very easy to drink. I poured at cellar temp... so about 53°F. I picked up the hops and a subtle but obvious sweet taste. What is that? Almost tastes of some sort of roasted malt. Mmmm. Good.  MF Very smooth. I do have a heavy bitter tinge in the back of my pallete/throat. But the overall MF is very subtle up front and leaves a great kick at the end.  D Very, very drinkable. It is very bitter but it leaves you with the sweet flavor at the end. The sweet brings you back for more and more.  I saw this beer at my local Bevmo but kept bypassing it. I must admit that I finally looked it up here and realized that people were reviewing it through the rough. I now see why.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,u2carew,4.22,"(A) Bronze color. Pours with a decent head with good carbonation. (S) Peach and grapefruit aroma with a light hint of malty sweetness. (T) Grapefruit bitterness paired with malty sweetness (M) Crisp, medium bodied brew. Not an over bearing amount of carbonation. (D) A delicious Imperial IPA. Great fruity notes complimented with hop bitterness, but not too much.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,bonkers,4.08,"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours a golden yello with a moderate head. Nice lacing follows it down the glass. The smell is grapefruit and pine, but IMO a bit weak for a DIPA. The flavor is heavy on grapefruit with moderate bitterness. The finish lingers with a pleasant amount of piney bitterness. A medium bodied beer that has a piney resin feel to it. A very drinkable beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,whoneeds8,3.76,"Pours out a transparent golden yellow with a nice thick head. Very good lacing. Smell is very faint, but I'm not known for having a good nose.  Taste is very hop bitter, however it's just not what I'd expect for an Imperial IPA. It's good, really good. But just not strong enough to be a ""wallop"".",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,PerzentRizen,3.83,I took my first sip and I actually shivered it had so much hop bite. This one was extremely fresh. I got it straight off the truck at Green's in Atlanta on Buford. This is one excellent DIPA.  I poured mine into a Fuller's ESB Imperial Pint. The head was really rich and billowy. The lacing is actually really thick.  The aroma is faint but still present with great maltiness and juicy hop smells.  The first taste is like a punch in the mouth. I really did shiver. This beer is much hoppier than Ruination but in a different way. There isn't a burn but a bitterness that rescends back to a fruity sweetness then back to bitter after a minute. This is one long IPA.  The mouthfeel is light yet creamy in a way. The malt really does hold up the hop in this case. I won't say there is any real balance because this beer does deliver what it promises - a HOP WALLOP!  Quick question...if you are actually scared to take a second sip does that mean a beer is not drinkable? I did take another sip and I loved it! Go grab six of these and enjoy!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,fishtownhxc,3.75,"it's kind of hard for me to be down on this beer because overall it's a really solid brew. i was sort of expecting more considering hop devil is one of the more solid IPA's brewed on the east coast.  pours a nice golden yellow to amber color with a brilliant citrus and floral hop nose. not to bitter up front which makes this one pretty easy to drink. finishes pretty clean and crisp, and a bit more balanced than i expected but liked. for the ABV it's a pretty easy drinking beer and you have to be careful because they will catch up to you.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BeanBone,4.82,"Appearance: Hazy golden-orange body with a couple of fingers of bubbly off-white head. Good lacing.  Aroma: Aptly named, this beer smacks you right in the face with citrusy and piney hops. Underneath, good malt and lots of booze. This is terrific.  Taste: Flowery, juicy, and citrusy hops explode right off the bat. Towards the end, a solid malt backbone takes command. Assertively bitter, yet balanced and smooth - everything just meshes right. Some booze towards the end, but the bulk remains hidden well. The aftertaste is of fresh hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation and a long, dry finish.  Drinkability: Considering the style (and alcohol content), this has superb drinkability.  Verdict: If you're a hophead, Hop Wallop is simply a terrific experience. While it's no doubt a hop-bomb, I find it relatively balanced and quaffable. I've only had two Victory brews, this and HopDevil, and I must say I'm already quite enamored with this brewery.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,JordanChabot,4.65,"Poured this into an over sized snifter. Has rich golden color with a nice thick finger of head. The lacing is a thorough, full proof record if where the beer has touched.  The smell is full of citrus and spice. Grapefruit and lemon pepper fill the nose with a sweet floral finish.  The mouth feel is resinous, semi-sticky, and full bodied for an I.P.A.... nice and chewy. Carbonation is soft and light. Again, grapefruit shows itself alone with peppery spice and lemon peel. There is a nice honey-suckle floral sweetness prominent throughout. The finish is surprisingly clean for such a packed ale.  One of my favorite ales for sure. This bad boy is PACKED with aromatic and complex hops. Always my go to with some extra spicy buffalo wings with extra chunky bleu cheese!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,schellsbeer,4.23,"I love Bitter. Plain and simple. This is what makes this beer stand apart from others.  Dry. Bitter. Hoppy. Excellent.  If you love hops and you love pine needles, than look no further. Fantastic beer. Victory has an impressive line-up. That being said, don't really care for the Golden Monkey because of how sweet it is but all of the others....great.  High Alcohol so don't plan on having too many of these. Also, straw color with pine and hop smell that you can detect a mile away. SMACKS you from across the room.  Pick some up. Great with a good Saturday afternoon sandwich.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,adamks,3.98,"a: pours pale orange with a one-finger head.  s: HOPS, pine, citrus.  t: nice and hoppy upfront, citrus and tart bitterness follow.  m: it's got a lip-puckering sour feel to it, that's how hoppy this thing is.  d: this is a mighty hop bomb for sure. if that's what you like, i think it's a good one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,smanders,4.38,"Purchased at Whole Foods (Fair Lakes) - Enjoy by Oct 20, 2009  Appearance - thick, white head that lingers. Nice lacing. The beer itself is corn-yellow and clear as a bell.  Smell - believe it or not I couldn't smell too much. Maybe it's because it's 19 degrees here today and the beer's too cold.  Taste - what I couldn't smell is intensely present in the taste! Hop-heads should line up for this bitter onslaught. Spicy pine is predominant throughout followed by a mellow warming from the 8.5% ABV.  Mouthfeel - smooth with a dry finish. I think I need another...  Drinkability - very high. Thanks Horace Wallop for sharing your recipe. If you like HopDevil, you will LOVE Hop Wallop. I will definitely be making this a ""regular"" purchase.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BuffaloTapHugger,4.3,"Poured 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. Garage cellared with single digits outdoors made for little head. Smells of grapefruit, pine, orange are noticed among the garfield orange haze color exterior. Gulp. Big hit of the hops are only to be expected in this IIPA and come through in an amazing way. A bitter aftertaste of loose pine tar. Little thick in texture, best enjoyed while sipping. Overall, a stellar example of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ncstateplaya,4.5,"Go out and get whallopped!!! May very well be my favorite Victory Brew!!!  Appearance: There is an abundant creamy off-white head which receeded to about 1/2"" before taking my first sip. It pours a golden straw color with nice clarity. Frothy lacing coats the glass all the way to the bottom.  Smell: Citrusy hops are about all I can smell. Granted I am a little stopped up (damn this weather), but there is definitely an abundance of hops causing my mouth to water.  Taste: Intense...a bitterness like grapefruit rind. The bitterness attacks the tastebuds from the very instant it touches the tongue and completely through the finish. This may be my ideal beer, from a hoppy perspective, I love it.  Mouthfeel: I love the bitterness, it turns your palate, leaving you thirsting for more. It definitely has a drying finish. I found it to be medium bodied and exceptionally smooth.  Drinkability: Exceptional!!! The drinkability far exceeds my ability or willingness to continuously pay for it. A great craft brew that I will continue to enjoy and recommend.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Onenote81,4,"I've been so excited to try this beer! I thought I needed to trade for it, but alas, it was in my local store all along.  Pours a dark gold with a nice 2-finger white head on top. Great retention mixed with some decent lacing, makes this a fine-looking brew. Scent is an overpowering citrus, mixed with a touch of alcohol-esque astringency. Gives a nice burn in the nose. Mouthfeel is a nice crisp, slightly watery drink. Makes this go down smooth. Wow! This is a nicely done DIPA! Great hop presence that is crisp and bitter. A definitive higher bitter aftertaste, but it is a ""double."" Small amount of peppery spiciness present as well. I dig this. Recommend.  [EDIT]  Vintage 2008 sampled on 2/23/10.  Poured into a pint glass. Pours a cloudy dark gold with a massive white head on top. Excellent retention; left some decent lace. Lots of bubbles rising up. Scents of faded flowers, light citrus, toffee and honey. The mouth is crisp and bubbly still. Plenty of carbonation. The high bitter presence has long left the premises. In its place is a dark, sweet, toffee-like flavor. Some light honey on the finish as well. This beer still packs some bitter punch, but the sweetness has evolved for sure. Not bad. Much better fresh, but a treat aged. Glad I put this one away back then.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,kbeals,3.65,"This beer is a hazy golden color. About three fingers of white, slightly creamy head. Pretty good lacing. Smells are mostly of hops of course, a bit of a citrus background. Taste is very hoppy, citrusy, a bit bready. Has a dry, floral bitter finish. Very smooth, well carbonated, light-medium body, overall a pleasing mouthfeel. I don't think I could drink another one of these though. The hops were a bit too much for me unfortunately.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,fitzy84,4.56,"Bought a six-pack recently. Appearance is a clear copper color with some patchy lacing and a thin head. Aromas are indeed a wallop: spiced, fruity hops, hops and more hops. Excellent, grassy smell; very strong and awesome. Taste follows the aromas, but it is surprisingly well-balanced with a bittersweet aftertaste mixed in with the supreme amount of hops. Good mouthfeel, crisp and carbonated but supplemented by a smooth body, almost lightly creamy. Probably one of the strongest but most balanced IPA I have had in awhile. Excellent.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,superdedooperboy,3.88,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Freshness date of November 6, 2009 clearly printed on the label.  Pours a bright gold, displaying excellent clarity and raising a nice finger of off-white foam that shows decent retention and leaves some webs of lace along the sides of the glass.  Pretty much just citrus hop aromas in the nose, without much else detected.  Fairly full-bodied with nice carbonation. A bit of sweet malt flavor is barely detectable amongst the mass of bitter, herbaceous, and citrus hop flavors that dominate the palate. Finishes very dry and bitter.  Basically the name says it all: This one is a wallop of hops. While not as bitter as some other examples of the style, the scales in this brew fall heavily toward the hop side, without much else to balance it out. Still, worthy, though one must watch out for the 8.5% ABV, which can be sneaky in this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,dancinwillie,4.09,"Pours clear and yellow, topped by a tight, white head. With the exception of the head, looks suspiciously like a fizzy macro. Really, surprisingly clear.  It smells more promising than it looks. Citrus, and tropical fruits dominate. Must be a lot of hops here, because it somehow smells sticky.  Walloped indeed! Burnt my tongue a bit there, but in a very good way! Strong hop flavors include orange and grapefruit, mango, pineapple, damn, lit my tongue up again. Hard to tell what's under all that fruit hop flavor, but I'm not complaining. Good sticky lacing is left on the glass as I consume, which compels me to add a half point back to the appearance rating. Some really good flavor. Although, a little lacking in the malt department.  Slightly thin mouthfeel, I'm thinking if this was a little more malt forward, it would also be fuller. Good bitter finish, slightly dry, ruby red grapefruit.  Pretty drinkable, despite the unbalance. Although with a beer like this, I guess that's really the point anyway. Tasty, fruity, and super bitter, in the best way possible. And, amazingly quaffable for 8.5% ABV. A keeper for sure. Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Clydesdale,4.13,"A: A glowing, hazy yellow-orange color with a relatively large, creamy off-white head with great retention. Lacing is impressive.  S: Thick, vibrant orange/tangerine citrus aromas up front. Some piney notes also evident. A sweet, vaguely bready nose as well.  T: A big, big smorgasbord of hop flavor up front. Grapefruit and bitter orange, resiny pine, and some bitter earthiness is all present. There is a nice underlying sweetness up front, somewhat bready/biscuity, but it is quickly swallowed by the layers of hops. A lengthy hop bitterness lasts and lasts. Some alcohol is also detectable, but it's masked well for 8.5%.  M: Oily hops, with a smooth mouthfeel overall. Carbonation somewhat subdued. A riding dry bite, as expected.  D: This is well done. Balanced? Not really, but they managed to pack a lot of flavor in without relying only on overwhelming bitterness. It's certainly a big beer, but it drinks pretty well all things considered.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,DoubleJ,4.26,"I'm craving a serious hop fix, so it's time to feed it. I'm betting Hop Wallop will do the trick. On to the beer:  This is a thick headed beer here, and I'm not sure it's coming down. Oktoberfest orange in color, somewhat transculent body. Aroma...I smell hops and resin, though the overall aroma is muted to some extent. Now to end my hop craving....that is good. Good hop flavor here. Balanced...sweet citrus and grapefruit. Bits of bready malt. And it still manages to be drinkable. Lush oily texture, just about perfect there.  After opening a dud bottle six months ago, I have been waiting to try this one fresh. This gets a big thumbs up from a West Coast beer drinker.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,swizzlenuts,3.95,"The beer pours a pale orange, that almost makes a straw yellow; a bit in between both. There is a nice small white head on it. The nose is filled with a huge earthy, piny, resiny smell. There is also a bit of sweetness as well. The flavour of the double IPA is almost all piny or resiny hops, but a nice sweetness comes through. The sweetness has a touch of citrus or grapefruit. The more you drink the ale, the more the sweetness comes out and the less amount of earthiness comes out; however, about 90 percent of the time you drink this you can only taste the resiny/piny hops. If you want an absurd amount, then have at it. The most unique IIPA I've ever had for sure. The mouth feel is creamy, but could be a bit more full bodied. I can only really have one of these a night because of the absurd amount of resiny hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Piney hops and a large malty, sweet, brown sugar cookie character underlying in the nose, dont really know what all thats about. Resinous, oily hops invade without any true distinction, i cant get over cake-like malty sweetness going on here, the dreaded gym sock smell picks up later in the glass, the quaff ends very bitter and with a slight breath of alcohol.

First smell is of some sweet malts, pine trees , grapefruit and lots of hops  Taste is similar. Some grapefruit, piny, and lots of hops. Bitter aftertaste with some alcohol at the end but not as much as expected. Almost no malt flavors though  Nice balance of carbonation, thick, smooth, body.

Smell is as expected a hoppy mother. Citrus and pine strike, though more may be present under the radar. Lemon strikes upon the second smell.  Taste is not nearly the wallop I was expecting. Hops are actually mellow and balanced to the point where well, yes this is a hoppy beer, but maybe even a good into to the world of hops for those afraid of an IPA. Alcohol is well hidden. Very impressive.  Mouthfeel is good, light to medium bodied, medium carbonation. Right for this taste.  Drinkability.

345,14916,epk,3.74,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass (tulip style)  At first site this brew is fairly pale and golden. The head pours thick and though it dissipates soon it also retains a nice wet lace. It's aroma is summed up in one word, ""Hops"" and you can smell it as soon as you pour. Defiantly earthy.  At first sip the hops are evident yet not too over powering which is fairly pleasing. Towards the aftertaste and with a proper mouthful the hops shine, giving you the taste you expect from a beer called ""hop wallop"". The higher abv is fairly covered by this wallop.  I would rate drinkability high. My wife, not a fan of the more hopsy beers, took a sip and still said she liked it which I can only attribute to that initial easy sipping smooth taste.

The head dissipated after one or two sips, but left a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma: Grassy, earthy, and hoppy. Hints of citrus as well.  Taste: Hoppy bitterness dominates, with a nice hint of citrus in the background. There wasn't that initial sharp hop bite that I've come to expect from IPAs, so despite the bitterness, it was surprisingly smooth (if that makes sense). A slight citrus note in the background, that helped smooth out the aftertaste. The hops lingered for awhile in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Thicker than I expected for an IPA, but in a good way. Nicely carbonated.  Drinkability: I'd definitely get this one again. Despite the bitterness, there was something smooth about it that made it very easy to drink.

A better smelling bottled hop I have not found and at a reasonable price, I'll be getting more of this.  Its fresh hops from start to finish, but it does get a little syrupy as it warms. There is a sweetness to the malt that makes it a little less bitter. You wouldn't know it from the nose. This might be the first beer I actually took more sniffs than sips.

Aroma is pretty good, all hops. There is a quite strong grassy aroma with resinous and citrus notes as well. Taste is pretty good, very hop forward but with a nice malt backbone. The grassy notes that are present in the aroma and missing from the flavor. Resiny/piney hops dominate the flavor with hints of citrus. Hop flavor and bitterness both build throughout and reach a crescendo then segue into a long hoppy, bitter finish.

Lush pine, deep grapefruit, a touch of lemon. Baked bread malts at the edge of the hops huddle saying ""Hey, I'm here, too!"" -- but, the varsity hops don't pay him any real attention.

T: More hops, with just enough malt to rein it in. This is the first time I've had it fresh; when I'd had it before, I thought it almost like a double ESB, with a very pronounced bready character. This time it's just hops, with a slight quinine-like flavor.  M: Mildly syrupy, but not terribly so. Fairly crisp.  D: I can't decide: on the one hand, it should be a sipping beer. But I can't stop drinking it. I'm normally a Ruination type of guy, but this is a damn good alternative for a few bucks less. Fresh, it's pretty drinkable.

Smells like I stuck my face in a resiny pine bow. Can pick up some orange citrusy notes as well.  The taste is similar to if I stuck a hop cone directly into my mouth and munched on it, then squirted some orange juice on a pine cone and took a big bite of that. This leaves a crazy bitter hop after taste on the palate. I was burping up hops all night long.  The mouthfeel is quite light, the carbonation was lacking, however, IMO with the amount of hops in this you really do need more of a sparkling carb factor. For those of you who have seen the movie ""Me, Myself and Irene,"" picture the scene where Jim Carey walks into the police station with horrible cotton mouth: the white, chalky lips drawn tight over his teeth with that ridiculous sneer...that's how my mouth felt after this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,youngblood,4.18,"Holy smokes! This one does pack a wallop! I poured it out of the bottle into a tulip glass. Beautiful two finger head that remained for five minutes. Color is the most wonderful caramel color. Simply lovely. The smell is comparable to smelling a pine tree. Strong hops presence. Citrus and pine mostly. The taste takes a person a bit off guard if not prepared for it. Strong hops presence as indicated by the smell. Almost no malt detected. Very refreshing, but at 8.5% this one would do ya in quickly.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,CHSLBrew,3.95,"Poured into a pint glass.  A-Clear golden beer topped with a pale white head. Attractive, rather extensive lacing.  S-Some citrusy notes quickly turn to heavier piney character with hints of light grapefruit. Little to no malt character is evident.  T-Bitter and earthy hop character which is quickly overwhelmed by thick piney/resiny hops. The aggressive bitterness retains its strength as some bready and almost sweet malts come through. Finishes dry, very bitter.  M-Medium-full body, thick with hop bitterness and flavor. This beer is slow-moving and sticky through my mouth.  D-Good beer, very bitter, as it should be. Pretty complex, as well, with a hop-centric flavor backed by enjoyable malts. Get this one when you can.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Smells fruity; mainly pears and green grapes.  This beer has just about every hop flavor I can think of. There's some piney hops that lead into bitter, leafy, and herbal hops. Then the bitterness fades and some of the abovementioned fruits step in. Hop Wollop is hop exhaustive. Thick and chewy mouthfeel. Only negative I can say about this beer is the alcoholic dryness after swallow.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,dmamiano,4.26,"This one poured a hazy, straw color. Nice white head, lacing and carbonation. Smell was great, grapefruit hoppiness, malts intermingling and tickled the nostrils.

Very nice, big mouthfeel as well.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Citrus notes with some pine as well but what confused me most was some butterscotch in the nose. Not unpleasant but interesting T= pine and citrus of course lots of grapefruit. There is also some of that delicious butterscotch. M= smooth and bitter. A little heavy but still nice. Great carbonation D= very high I can feel the alcohol in my belly though which could prove to be trouble later. Very delicious though.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

S- Extremely hoppy scent as one would expect based on the name of this beer. You can definitely smell the alcohol in this as well.  T- It's definitely a hoppy beer, but it is not as overpowering as I thought it would be. The high alcohol content is fairly well hidden. There is also a hint of sweetness as well.  M- Surprisingly smooth going down. Sort of a dry finish, but not as dry as you would expect from this beer.  D- Much more drinkable than I originally thought it would be. It's definitely a hoppy beer, but very drinkable.  Overall an excellent beer. Hoppy, without being too hoppy.

All finishing hops.  T-The initial hit of the hops is softened by a great malt sweetness that gives way to an awesome spicy grapefruit bitterness. This has Yakima hops written all over it, spicy, citrusy somehow sweetly bitter.  M-Great, thick but still washes over the tounge like concentrated hop oil.  D- Very high. I have to limit my hop wallop intake, very sessionable despite the ABV%  If you like the west coast take on IIPA (Green Flash, Moylan's, Pliny) this is your brew.

345,14916,mdalston17,3.39,"12 oz Bottle Poured into Ice-Cold NC STATE WOLFPACK pint glass from the freezer. 12/23/08. Last night before headed home for Christmas. Girlfriend gone home. Roommates gone home. Work on the 24th? Feeling lonely? Have an 8.5% beer to settle the woes! Here goes.  Listening to Howlin' Rain's self-titled debut, staring at my pet turtle chasing minnows. He gets dinner, I get a cold glass of beer. Merry Christmas.  Appearance: Well, the freezer left a tiny ice chunk in the bottom of the glass. Noticed on pour but not before. Pours a 1/4-inch think white head that settles but won't disappear completely. Nice. Beer is clear but not as clear (which is to say crystal) as I'd remembered from dropping a couple of these between eggnog sessioning last weekend. (Note: this beer goes GREAT with rum!) Tiny bubbles keep rising to the top of the glass. Nice, twice. Clearer and lighter and more straw-colored than other DIPAs I've had. Hey! The bubbles just shot my ice chunk to the top of the glass. This beer is earning high marks already.  As I drink this, I don't quite get a sip-o-meter, but lacing is nice.  Smell: The first thing that pops in my head is, strangely, Delerium Tremens. This is not that, though. I smell orange/grapefruit and under what is certainly a lot of hop-oil aroma I can make out the smell of our culprit, the 8.5% of booze hiding in there. Not overwhelmed/excited by any of this. Smells unbalanced.  Taste: The alcohol is in there, and I can taste it. All bittering and no finishing, I'd say as an extremely amateur reviewer. Overly sweet, and I taste all citrus but very little flower or pine. OK, a little pine. This tastes ... less American in influence than other DIPAs I've had. Hop bitterness and malt sweetness both appear and feel disparate and independently large rather than complementary.  Mouthfeel: Marks for this, though. I like the level of carbonation and while I was harsh on taste, this is a highly-sessionable beer as far as weight is concerned. It just has to be your mug 'o beer, so-to-say.  Drinkability: See mouthfeel. I am pounding this beer, middling as I may find certain aspects of it..  Consensus: There are better DIPAs, and there are better high-gravity offerings from Victory. Will try again, though. Very easy-drinking despite its aroma and flavor. Before I joined beeradvocate, I didn't think that sentence could exist and make sense.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,RickSawyer,4.54,"Pours a clear, lively golden amber with a very pleasant white capped head constructed of tightly wound bubbles. Smells wonderfully hoppy! Big juicy citrus (grapefruit, orange zest and juice), spearmint, nice and chewy! Taste is just as wonderful. A slight biscuitty malt struggles to keep the grapefruit dominating hops in check! Finishes dry and clean. Just a wonderful double IPA... the drinkability is masked so well. Have to watch myself on these as they will catch up on me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,roscoehnj,3.88,"I like Victory a lot but this one misses the mark a bit.  Looks fine, but thats not a tall order for a ipa or dipa. Not quite big enough in the nose and not enough of the hop smell I like so much. Tastes similarly lacking in the fruity hop department. I mean the hops are there but mostly for weight and bitterness - not enough citrusy tastes. More noticeable malt precence than typical for the style. This grows on me a bit as I finish the glass so I have to give it better marks than I would have thought for drinkability. All in all not a bad beer - I'll drink it again, but I think Victory can do better.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,slatetupelo,4.37,A - Pours a very light transparent copper with very little white head and just as much carbonation.  S - My nose is f'd up and I can't smell shit but I do smell something slightly fruity.  T- It actually tastes light for a DIPA. The presence of hops of citrus dominate with a great fruity aftertaste. Goes down smooth and the alcohol in hidden well. It's not that bitter compared to other IPAs an DIPAs.  D - I really enjoyed this. For a high alcohol beer I could drink quite a few of these. I could drink these as though they were just an IPA.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,GilGarp,4.32,"Pours from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass with copper orange color, good clarity, and very little head. What does form on top is gone quickly.  Aroma is hops, hops, and more hops. Nice spicy/piney hop smell.  Flavor is super hoppy as well. Nice and fresh, loads of pine. Plenty bitter and the malts don't go very far towards balancing it out. Pretty much a hop bomb.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and well carbonated.  Drinkability is good but with something so hoppy and high in alcohol, it's unlikely anyone would have several of these in a sitting.  A good double IPA but I think the hop profile seems one dimentional. It's huge and bitter, that's for sure.

345,14916,katan,3.83,"12 oz bottle, dated 11/13/2008 (a little late). Just cleaned my palette with a little Maytag blue cheese.  A - A light golden color. Light head that is white in color. Just a small hair of hazing on the inside. Beer is filtered.  S - A combination of floral, fruity, and piney hops with a fair amount of sweet maltyness. Lots of citrus sensation to the scent.  T - Starts off with a very balanced combination of hops fruitiness and malty sweetness. Some bitterness forms mid-stream. Finishes with a light malt note. Aftertaste is pleasantly non-existent. There is some alcohol warmth. Surprisingly light in flavor for a DIPA.  M - Moderate in body - not watery and not heavy. I would have to say that this beer is light in comparison with other DIPAs. Carbonation bite is light.  D - This beer is sneaking up on me in terms of alcohol. On a positive note, the beer is not filling nor is the flavor so potent that it prevents this beer being drank more than once in a session.  It seems more malt forward than other DIPAs I've had. A solid offering, but I'd probably lead towards Hop Slam, 90min, of Ruination instead.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,yesyouam,4.1,"Victory Hop Wallop is a crystal-clear golden ale with a fluffy, waxy off-white head. It has excellent lacing and retention. The aroma is very fresh and hoppy-- mostly pine needles and tangerine peel. There is a slight wave of sweetish malt. It has a smooth, medium body. It's a little foamy and the finish is dry. It tastes pretty much like the aroma-- all hops, as advertised.There is a wooden element to it, but mostly it's just nice and bitter. Good stuff!

Smell is a extremely deep hop smell. There is a slight malt smell in the background to level off just slightly, the hoppieness of this brew.  Taste is so full of hops it is almost blocking out the other flavors but there is also a slight pine taste. A hint of malt is in there with the wall of flavor.  Very tasty and a good beer overall. It will take an unexpected pallet to really get into the flavor. I am a big fan of hops and it was still a shock to the system.

Smell is a big blast of resinous, earthy hops. Dank!  Taste is also heavy on the hops of course, with light bready malt back bone, very bitter, lingering finish. Heavy on the pine resin, a hint of citrus, bittersweet, with a fresh mint hop flavor coming though as it warms up a bit. This one's an enamel stripper for sure, love it, one of the only things I miss about PA!  Mouthfeel is very oily, full carbonation with crisp, dry finish.  Drinkability is pretty high if a hophead like myself. I could use a little less bitterness tough, it's a palate buster and not a good session beer unless you're a real glutton for punishment.

345,14916,jkendrick,3.19,"Appearance: Very clear golden-orange color with a pillowy white creamy head. The head recedes moderately fast and leaves chunky lacing in its wake.  Aroma: Not as powerful an aroma as I expected. What's there is, of course, hoppy. There is pine and some citrus. It almost reminds me of the aroma of marijuana, although not as strong.  Mouthfeel: Nice smooth carbonation with a medium body. There is an oiliness that coats the mouth, but its not as sticky as many DIPAs.  Taste: Very hoppy and not as balanced as I'd hoped. It's still good, but it has bit too much of a bite and the bitterness is palette-numbing. It's difficult to pick out the flavors over the pure bitterness, but in the finish I detect grapefruit and pine. The finish is more of the same: very bitter with a not-too-pleasant aftertaste.  Overall impression: Well there's truth in advertising. It is a hop wallop. Unfortunately, for me it is just more bitter than balanced and what complexity may be there is lost due to the overwhelming bitterness. DIPAs are my favorite style, but this one just doesn't have it for me.

Anyway there is also a bready/wheat taste on the finish. The 8.5% is absolutely no where to be seen, awesome job in hiding that.  M - A spice tang is left on the back of the palate, but its an overall clean feeling.

It's enough to make the hops from knocking you out. The alcohol is a detectable but not bad at all. It helps to balance out all those tasty hops.  Mouthfeel is ok, kinda what is expected.

Pale malt and of honey, just a touch of maraschino cherries.  Large sweetness upfront caramel/honey flavor really difficult to pinpoint because the hop flavor and bitterness take hold aggressively. Hops are a bit herbal and grassy in flavor that swiftly moves to an earthy/piny/citrus bitterness that envelopes the entire palate. I am left with a severely dry palate as if I just took a massive chomp out of a grapefruit, peel and all! I need to take another sip.

345,14916,sweetbrew82,3.95,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass; ""best by"" date clearly marked Oct. 03, 2009  P: Hop Wallop pours out of the bottle deep-straw to light gold in color and creates a nice cascading effect. Looks good in the glass as it sits an orangish-amber colored liquid, topped off by a pearly-white 2 fingered head that's densely packed with tiny bubbles. Displays okay retention and leaves nice patches of webby lace upon retreat.  A: Needless to say, the hops bombard the nostrils with scents of citrus; slightly reminscent of orange rinds and huge doses of lemon zest. Beneath the huge waves of citrusy hops there is a toasted bready malt presence that rounds out the nice, but not very complex, aroma.  T: Whew! This is the definition of a palate-smacking hops flavor. While they do rule the palate with an iron fist, the toasted malts produce a bready flavor that attempts to lead an uprising, but resistance is futile. The sweet/lemony hops-heavy profile continues to lay the law. Even though it gets a little unbalanced at times, being the hops-head that I am, I love it. Bittering hops just sandblast the palate on the finish to leave a pleasantly-sour aftertaste that lingers for a while.  M: Has a nice medium-bodied feel to it. Aggressively carbonated with a carbonic ""bite"" that really pops on the tongue. Really clean and smooth.  D: Personally, I could make this one a session beer, even though it's packing an 8.5% ABV. Really good taste, but the huge wall of hops would probably begin to overwhelm the palate after awhile.  Notes: It really lives up to its name. This one is purely for hop-heads only! All others should probably steer clear of the Hop Wallop. The flavor profile is tight & clean, and leaves you feeling refreshed. If you'd like nothing more than a huge dose of hops in your beer (and believe that ""hoppiness is happiness"") then I recommend you try this one! A solid DIPA for sure.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

M: Good amount of carbonation, not watery or creamy...pretty normal.  D: Drinkability is pretty good, but the rye/pine I pick up in here makes it less enjoyable for me personally.

Strangely, I never got around to reviewing it. This review is based on a sample from the bottle.  Very light copper-colored body with numerous, fast-moving strands of carbonation bubbles. About a finger and a half of white head. Some decent retention, a layer of head stays on top of the drink for the entire duration. Great lacing; sticky rings that cover most the glass as you drink.  Huge hop aroma. Bitter, citrus, piney, floral. Basically all hops in the aroma, and I love it.  This is a hop bomb for sure. Layers of different hop flavors come through in the taste. Underneath all the hops is a very slight, sweet malt bill, but you have to look for it. The first flavor is an intense citrus hop flavor, followed by some more hops that have a piney flavor. It tastes like what I would expect pine tar to taste like, but I mean that in a positive way. Finishes with a big hop bitterness. The hops linger in the aftertaste, especially the citrusy flavors.

T - First taste has similar flavors that I smelled, sweet at first, with a bitter ending. M - Smooth, yet a nice coarse finish. Not too heavy, but something you can chew on. D - This is a great beer. For a 8.5% ABV there are no signs of it. A nice firm hop to it, but not overwhelming. Just enough to get into the other flavors of the beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,corby112,3.52,"Pours an amber golden color with a thin white head. Aroma of hops, grapefruit and other citrus fruits. Lots of hops up front balanced out with a slight lemony citrus flavor.

Appearance: Deep copper color; head is small, but retains for a long time with lacing  Smell: citrus smell followed by a strong hoppy scent  Taste: Tastes like a bitter orange juice and grapefruit juice mixed together; very pleasant taste and the flavor is steady  Drinkability: I find myself wishing I had drank this throughout the night instead of picking up only enough of this beer for special occasions.  Great beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Lace was rough with lareger bubbles in the ivory/tan foam and clung to the glass pretty thickly. S - Very fresh hops and spices on the nose - love it! T - hops tasted fresh picked and though bitter had a soft edge to them and lasted through the finish. Couldn't taste much malt to balance, but this is so good that their presence was not missed. Hops ere very piney tasting with floral oils (i know this sounds like a smell, but I swear I tasted it!) M - Pretty viscous but refreshing. D - Great, though the bitter finish does stay with you for a while.

345,14916,JRed,4,"Pours a cloudy gold with little white head. Amiable aroma of hops, sweet citrus notes and a little honey. Aggressive hop bitterness in taste that gives way to the driest finish around. This brew erases previous tastes from the palate with invading hop armies. Mild carbonation allows the tongue to embrace the hops and become an avid vegetarian for while. A dangerously smooth brew creates a great drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,shivtim,4.02,"Deep gold/amber beer, ever so slightly hazy, with a sticky off-white head. Nose is heavy on citrus hops, as expected. Nice and fruity.

345,14916,jhu1995,4.06,Pours an orange color with a nice head and lacing. Smell is citrusy with lemon aroma dominating throughout. Pineapple flavor shines through along with lemon and some creamy malt flavors. Mouthfeel is creamy with good carbonation. Drinkability is good for a double IPA.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,itcomesnpints,3.16,"A crisp amber pour with a billowing ivory head. Minimal lacing.  Smell was the first disappointment. Underwhelming spicy and earthy hop character. Caramel malt blows in stronger.  The hops are also absent from the palate. Not the hop bomb I was expecting. Malty. Boring.  No complaints with the mouthfeel. Carbonation fits nicely with the thicker body.  I'm being very lenient when I give this a 3 for drinkability. The first beer was a drain pour for me. A drinkable beer if you think of it as an Imperial Pale Ale.  Overall, this beer was a tremendous disappointment. The six-pack was supposed to be fresh, yet it tasted like a DIPA that had been sitting out for months, losing all the hop character I enjoy. It did not fit the citrusy/floral/piney American Double IPA profile (certainly not of the West). Hopdevil was also disappointing. Victory brewing makes an incredible pilsner and RIS, but I am not impressed with their ""hoppy"" beers. Too malty. Not hoppy enough. Poor representations of their styles.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,InsolublePancake,4.27,"A- Quite light for a DIPA. Light straw with orange highlights and about a half inch of head that sticks around for a minute or two. A nice lacing is left on the glass as the beer recedes.  S- Big, pungent hop aroma with lots of leafy, herbal goodness. Also a touch of sweet, tropical fruit.  T- More raw, unadulterated hops. The hop character here is quite different to most DIPAs that I've had. The taste is less about pine and citrus and more about spicy, leafy, and almost earthy flavors. There is no balance to this beer at all; the hops dominate from start to finish with barely a hint of malt. A hint of sweetness actually does come through from time to time, but it's gone before I can pin it down. The bitterness is very high, but it fits the beer so well that it isn't in the way.  M- Nice medium body with a good, strong carbonation level.  D- Actually very high. The alcohol isn't noticeable at all and the bitterness actually helps the drinkability. It makes me want to keep drinking. I wouldn't mind having a couple more of these... only if I wasn't going anywhere, of course.  This wasn't my first time trying this beer. I'd had it a couple times before and been very unimpressed, but I'm pretty sure that I had an old bottle on both occasions. I picked this one up knowing that it was fresh and it didn't disappoint. This isn't one of those sweet, malty, barleywine-like DIPAs. This beer is hop-forward and in-your-face. If you want balance, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a palate-wrecker, this is the beer for you. Recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,CrellMoset,4.05,"On cask at Brickstore Pub, Decatur, GA. Served in a fitted pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a clear orange amber beer with a swiss-cheese like head. Retention is average to above-average, and as it fades it leaves sticky, thick, bubbly lacing. A very nice-looking beer, though it's hard to tell which parts of that are due to the cask and which to the beer itself.  Aroma: Whew. Tons of hop notes - pine needles, sappy, syrupy, resinousy, grapefruit and orange zest, a healthy dose of mint looming large. This one's big and bold in the hop department, though at cask temperature it comes off as slightly harsh. Still very nice though.  Taste: Doughy and sweet with a nice roasted edge. Tons of citrus and pine add a nice dimension to the proceedings, coupled with tons of herbal notes. Oh, and, how about some bitterness? This one's got it, though it's not overbearing or rough.  Mouthfeel: Wonderfully smooth and even with a nice level of carbonation given the thickness. Casking seems to work well for this beer, given its body.  Drinkability: I've had Storm King on cask and Hop Devil on cask, but Hop Wallop on cask seems to work equally well. The body and flavors are such that they seem to come through nicely at this temperature and with this level of carbonation. Give it a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Ruslanchik,4.27,"12oz bottle with clearly marked ""best before"" date. This date is over a year away so clearly they are being a little generous here. No telling when it was brewed, but hoppy beers are, of course, best enjoyed fresh. Hopefully this one was straight from the brewery to my glass.  This beer pours a dark golden color. The head is snowy white and starts off big--over two fingers after the pour--and died down slowly leaving good lacing all around the glass. The beer is pretty clear. I would have liked to see a little haziness in such a hoppy brew.  The aroma is complex and interesting. It is, of course dominated by hops. The most evident hop aroma is of fresh pine needles. But this trails a very clear smell of tomato-based pasta sauce. As the beer warms a bit jasmine flowers appear in the smell, taking back to my days in Taiwan...they say smell is the sense closest linked to memory.  Drinking this beer is like experiencing 50 megaton nuclear explosion at about 2 miles: At first you taste some lovely floral notes that seem distant but beautiful, then there is a rising bitterness that hints at something terrible and ferocious. After a few moments you are struck by a powerful blast of bitterness that puckers your mouth and leaves your taste buds running for cover. All is not safe when this is past, though, because the bitterness hangs around to slowly kill off any parts of your tongue that haven't taken refuge in government approved bomb shelters. Sensible people would stop once they have experienced the horror (nuclear weapons or hops, take you pick) but Americans can't get enough. Sign me up for a sixer of this stuff!  The mouthful is surprisingly light for such a strong beer. Carbonation is light, which is perfect for the style. The beer clears off the palette nicely, which is good because the bitter flavor definitely hangs around for a few minutes.  This is not something that you'll want to drink all night long. The bitter flavors would leave your tongue battered and bruised. But I would definitely enjoy another, which, for such a strong beer, is really saying something.  Overall, I'm left with two strong impressions: Jasmine flowers and bitterness. I have a special place in my heart reserved for jasmine green tea, so this beer gets bonus points for pulling my heart strings. I'm definitely a hop head so bitter is beautiful in my book. This will definitely earn another purchase.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,SeanRedd,4.12,"Beautiful balance of hop strength. Firm, spicy malt background to support loads of floral hops. Sits light copper, stunning foamy head, an aroma to die for.

Why doesn't everybody brew an American Double/Imperial IPA, it seems like everybody likes them. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. I am not a huge fan of the appearance of this beer, looks like your average ale with clingy head which dissipates. The nose is where this brew starts to com alive, hops, hops, and more hops. There are some slight citrus notes, almost no malt, but yet the nose in not out of balance. The taste and mouthfeel follows the nose in that really too much hops, yet seems balanced. As far as the drinkability, I have had 4 early on a Friday, I don't think I will be going out this evening that 8.5 will catch you, doesn't seem as strong as it is.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

The smell also rocks, with all kinds of juicy, candy hop aroma with some underlying caramel and just a hint of grassyness.  Lots of hop flavors show up on the palate. There is some alcohol flavor. The bitternes shows up around mid-swallow. Some spicyness also shows up. Though strong, the bitterness does not linger like most IIPA's I've had. The finish is fairly quick. The mouthfeel is nice and full with a fairly low amount of carbonation.  Overall, I think this is the best IIPA I've had. The fact that the bitterness does not linger too long makes it much more drinkable than most.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

M: Medium body with a foamy carbonation.  D: Very smooth drinkable beer.  Had to try this after being a fan of the Hop Devil from Victory. I like this brew much better.

Taste is almost all hops with a very thin biscuity malt presence struggling to come through down the middle. A little sweetness from the alcohol is noticed on the very front but is quickly overcome. Lingering bitterness begs another drink. Unbalanced, just as advertised. Mouthfeel is good. Not too much heat for an 8.5. I had high expectations for this one, and it didn't disappoint me.

The aroma is dominated by floral pine hops and some citrus notes as well. There is a bready malt presence as well.  The flavor has more citrus hops than the pine that I got in the aroma. There is certainly grapefruit, oranges, and a hint of resin. The malt body is evident as well.  The mouthfeel is crazy smooth due to the cash with less carbonation than I remember in the bottle version. Still has a prickly hop bitterness in the finish though.  This is a good DIPA and I enjoyed the smooth cash version. Not one of my favorites but still very drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,glid02,4.4,"Got this on cask at the Brick Store in Atlanta.  Pours a hazy light copper color with a rocky one-finger head. The head dissipates into a bunch of big bubbles on top and a thick ring around the glass. Lacing is interesting - this beer leaves larger than average bubbles clinging to the side of the glass.  Smells of juicy grapefruit and robust sweet malt. I'm excited about taking a sip of this.  Tastes great. Smooth grapefruit and sweet malt flavors followed almost instantaneously by a good amount of bitterness. Unlike the bottle version I'd had previously the bitterness isn't overpowering. It's a bit more mild now, leaving the door open for the citrus flavors to shine through.  Mouthfeel is great. Very smooth with subdued carbonation, this glides down my gullet.  Drinkability is great. I had to make a conscious effort not to gulp this one down, and I wish MARTA ended up closer to my house so I could've had a few more.  Overall this is the best IPA I've had on cask.

Poured a nice light amber color with about 2 inches of head that laced the entire glass throughout.  S- Citrusy hops! Not much malt in the scent, but plenty of hoppy goodness.  T- Delicious. Fresh grapefruit citrus was the initial taste I got from this beer followed by a huge hop punch. Upon swallowing this beer the hop taste was even more outstanding.  M- A bit oily and left a nice aftertaste in the mouth.  D- Probably a bit too high on the alcohol side to be a session beer, although is a wonderful beer for a relaxing night and having one or two.

It pours a hazy caramel color with an easy two finger of white head. There is amazing lacing that lasts the beer.  The aroma is of a delicious hoppy nature with hints of citrus to it. As for the taste, hello hops. Not that bitter with a slight hint of citrus as an aftertaste.  I love this beer, it is everything that i could have ever dreamed for in a beer. Excelent drinkability and an incredible mouthfeel.  You just have to try this one.

345,14916,Gambrinus1184,3.98,"Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into a Brew Thru pint glass.  A: Poured a nice, golden amber color with a bit of light orange tint and great clarity. Some lazy carbonation can be seen flitting towards the sticky one-finger head of white foam.  S: Smells of resinous and herbal hop aromas, a bit of spice and musty citrus fruits.  T: Tastes of sweet citrus begin at the front of the palate where a toasted malt and grain flavor is quickly washed over by a rush of pine and grapefruit hoppiness. The finish is slightly bittersweet with a residual pine and lemon flavor. Hops are quite fresh tasting.  M: Mouthfeel is medium bodied but with a nice snap of hops to smack the sense out of your taste buds.  D: A pretty easy-drinking DIPA and one of a good enough balance to mask any phenol alcohol flavors. A good, sturdy pine and quite apparent citrus flavor combine well to make this a sessionable DIPA.  Beware of the ""sessionable DIPA"" tag; it'd be tough to go to other beers after a few of these. In fact, it'd probably be tough to do a lot of things after a few Hop Wallops.

Piney resinous cones, paired with overripe citrus fruit. Soft oranges and lemon grass. Pine needle hop flavor.  M. Lightly carbonated and medium bodied. Semi dry finish.  D.

Aroma is filled with citrusy hops, mostly grapefruit and tangerine. Some piney notes are definitely in there too. Even some sweet caramel malt manages to make it through.  Taste is absolutely delicious. Some sweet caramel flavors at the start blend with some fruitiness then the hop wallop starts and we're handed a big dose of citrusy and piney hop flavors. The bitterness here is very smooth and not at all harsh like some DIPAs tend to get. Huge hop flavor though it seems to taper off a bit at the finish which stops me from scoring it perfect.

The beer was an orange/amber color that was a bit like honey. Hazy/clear with some tiny carbonation bubbles visible. Lacing was aggressive.  Aroma was nice and a good combination of sweet ripe fruits and floral notes with pine. There was also a spicy nature to the aroma.  Taste is real nice. The alcohol is there but rather well hidden . Ripe fruits start with some ripe pineapple or papaya. Then some sweetness pops in before giving way to the hop bitterness and the pine/grapefruit flavors. You can sense the hop oils on your tongue. Near the end you are left with a spicy, white pepper sensation and the lingering hop bitterness. Quite nice.  Not a session brew, you should savor this baby. The mouth feel is medium bodied and a both syrupy. There is a nice tingle from the carbonation.

This beer pours an amber, hazy straw with a nice 2 finger white head that left amble lacing. The smell is piney hops with a nice sweet malt backbone. As a side note, there is a musty sent to it, almost cheesy hoppy scent. If the hop presence weren't so upfront, I would think this would have been an old bottle but with its hops I'm fairly positive that it's pretty fresh. The taste is piney all the way through. There is a very bitter aftertaste and not in a good way. It seems almost to have a medicinal taste to it. Like sucking on an uncoated aspirin.

This would be a dangerous session beer, as it is highly drinkable, but the mellow hops hide the 8.5% alcohol!  Appearance was a nice & hazy golden yellow, and it left behind quite a bit of lacing as the beer magically disappeared.  I thought it had a strong hops scent, but the taste was quite a different story. The bite I was expecting was replaced by a mellowness, and a smoothness, that really allowed me to hhold the beer in my mouth to really savor and enjoy the fine taste.  Overall an execellent beer.

Not the wallop I was expecting. After quickly looking for a best of date, I notice none and now start to wonder the freshness of this beer. There is also a malt scent but its not as full as I hoped.  Taste is slightly above average. There is a nice toasty malt flavor with a strong astringency. The bitterness is up there but there is no great hop flavor. A little oily pine taste is there but not a citrus hop wallop. Lame.  I'm kind of disappointed in this beer. It has a big ABV but not a great flavor. This one I thought was fresh but maybe its a little old, other reviews has this one in high regards.

345,14916,ThreeWiseMen,4.69,"Thank you Aprilluvsbeer. This one was superb!  Appearance: Pours a clear, pale gold, with no apparent carbonation. Weird looking, especially for a double IPA. Head is loose and soapy, and drags extremely clumpy lacing behind it.  Smell: Honey and sweet, toasty malts. Floral hops (pretty light though). Caramel, molasses, citrus, melon? Green apple. Chocolate and nuts? The smell is quite sweet - very tantalizing. Really complex; I just can't seem to put my finger on what's in there, but I LOVE IT!  Taste: Caramel, toasted malts, alcohol, woody molasses, and a grassy hop finish. Now normally I love big, bold, I2PAs, and while this one is more on the mild side (especially in terms of hops), I fucking love it! Great job Victory!  Mouthfeel: This is so creamy. Man! This is awesomely good! Anyhoo, this pup is pretty slick, with low carbonation, medium body, and a fantastic caramel malt and hop aftertaste.  Drinkability: I would drink this beer all day. Not as powerful (in terms of hoppiness) as I would normally expect for an I2PA, but this shit is delicious. Really smooth too. Drink up my brethren!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,benmiliron,4.87,"Love the bearded old guy on the bottle. Pours a beautiful white head, chunky, good lacing. Smell is incredible - perfect floral aroma. Taste is exquisite - good malt with very strong hops but well done - not overly acidic or bitter. It's like liquid hop aroma with all malt in the taste. I don't know how they did this. Gravity, small & soft bubble, & stickiness all come together on this one for the mouthfeel. Just beautiful.  This one's a classic. I should drink more of it. One of the best IPAs in existence.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,oriolesfan4,4.34,My go to package store finally got this in stock so I was pretty psyched.  As expected it was a very hoppy beer in both aroma and taste. It's well balanced and smooth and for such a high ABV the alcohol is hidden well. I felt there was a lack in appearance but the beer was well above average in just about every other category.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Mauerhan,3.83,"stopped by hollingshead's in orange to grab a sandwich and they had this on tap so i had to try. before i tried it kenny tells me that its a east coast double ipa. so it wasnt going to be as hoppy as some of the stuff out here but still ""an excellent beer""  poured a nice orange color with a nice creamy white head that retained quite well and left a decent amount of diamond like lacing.  i smell a bit of hops on the smell. but i get a bit of citrus, strangely the majority of the scent seems to come from the malts. i can smell rich maltyness.  taste is nice. kenny was right when i should not expect alot of hops, i wouldnt say that i was walloped by hops but they were there. and i guess it was alot for an east coast ipa. i get alot of citrus and the sweetness off the malts. overall a nice tasting beer. the finish is dry but leaves you with a pleasant aftertaste.  pretty nice mouthfeel. a little syrupy. but not to bad. i think that is in part of the malty sweet of the beer. decent amount of carbonation.  im pretty satisfied with this brew. i would like to continue to drink it. so if you see it give it a shot. you shouldnt be disappointed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,spointon,4.3,"I poured this ale from a 12oz brown bottle into an imperial pint glass.  A= This ale poured a very slightly hazy, pale orange-gold color with a beautiful 1.5"" snow white head. The head slowly dropped to a 1/4"" and there was a lot of active carbonation release throughout. Nice web-like lacing down the glass.  S= This was a very biscuity and citrusy smelling ale. I found bitter and tart aromas of oranges, grapefruits, and lemons alongside piney scents and bakery malt sweetness. The constant carbonation release made this a very aromatic experience.  T= Believe it or not, the sweet biscuit maltiness actually shared the front of the stage with the citrus and pine hop bitterness. I found this to be way more balanced than I expected from the reviews! The middle was almost all hop flavor and bitterness, and the finish was dry, estery, and full of alcohol warmth. Sort of an unpleasantly dry and bitter aftertaste made me want to keep drinking to get more of the ""front end"" of this ale.  MF= Medium bodied and not too syrupy like some other DIPAs can get. Despite the nearly constant and huge carbonation release, this ale was soft on the tongue and lacked the crispness I was hoping for (dead on for the style however).  D= I think Victory does hoppy beers extremely well, and this one did not disappoint. Outstanding - I recommend it highly!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,largadeer,3.73,"12 oz bottle from Dyan, as usual. Best by May 05, 2009.  Appearance: Light amber, brilliantly clear, with a frothy three finger head that rises above the glass for a moment before slowly settling, leaving a ton of lace behind as it falls.  Smell: Caramel wafers, primarily. Very candy-like and sweet. There's a bit of aromatic hops in there as well, faintly citrusy, but it takes a backseat to the big malt body.  Taste & mouthfeel: Sweet candied grapefruit, ripe nectarine, caramel malt. Very sweet and malt-forward for the style, but thankfully not too heavy or boozy. Bitterness is ample, but not over the top. Despite that, this one's a lot heavier on the bittering hops than the flavor and aromatic hops. This is good, but it's not my favorite style of DIPA. Give me a dry, aromatic IPA any day over these East Coast malt bombs.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,hellomcfly,4.03,"Thanks to chefnash for this one.  Poured from bottle into a victory pint glass  A - Light golden orange in color. A fluffy off white 2 finger head. Really great lacing.  S - Summery citrus smell. A little earthy and bready.  T - Piney hops that give way to fruitiness and alcohol taste and ends with a grapefruity hop bite.  M - Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, very smooth.  D - Drinkability is pretty good for a DIPA. I could go for two but I don't know if I would want more than that.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,cameraman,4.17,"A golden amber color, with a inch white colord head, that laces slowly along the glass. A strong grassy fragrance hits the nose at first. That is followed by a light citrusy aroma, then the sweet scent of some malt, with a touch fruitiness comes through. The malt makes a cameo appearance at first taste, that is soon overtaken by strong hop flavors. Grapefruit citrus, grass, and earthy flavors take over for the malt and stay there till the very end. A medium bodied feel, that stays very balanced till it reaches thr back of the palate. That is where it seems to gain some weight and feels a little like a light oil. A very complex beer, with an invitng aroma, incredible taste, plus it is not an alchol bomb. It brings alot of extreme elements to the table, but alchol is not one of them, and that makes this very drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,changeup45,4,"Picked this one up at Brawley's Beverage in Charlotte, NC. Golden colored with a hint of amber in it. Nice head and some retention for lacing. Aroma is pine needles and grapefruit hops, nice, but not potent. Citrus and piney hoppy flavors are strong up front. Nice crisp bitterness with just a little malt backing. Not one of those in your face IIPAs and seemed a touch light for the style. Nevertheless this is quite good and enjoyable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BamaBeerBuff,4.62,"A: A beautifully light golden color with a touch of amber. A thick, sticky head leaves wondrously thick walls of lace on my glass.  S: Bursting with sweet citrus--light lemon, grapefruit, and orange. There isn't really any pine aroma in this one, it's all about the fruit. Big time nose for a big time beer.  T&M: Yummy. Piney citrus flavors abound with a slight underlying maltiness that holds everything together well. Body is full enough with a sticky, chewy, and savory feel. The finish is long and mouth-watering. This is a top quality beer for sure.  D: It's easy to get down, that's for sure. Too bad the ABV is so high--it would be so nice to drink this beer all day.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ClavinCliff,4.69,"Wow. Name says it all. Pours very clear, mostly golden in color with a hint of copper hue. Smell is hops, with a dash of hops and a slight hint of hops. Head pours out very well, sticky and hangs around for a bit. Taste, hmmm hops maybe? Hops up front, in the middle and at the end. You can feel the beer on your teeth. Slight hint of some malty sweetness towards the end but not much. A true hop head beer. An excellent selection.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,pmcadamis,4.44,"A - A huge four finger head builds up over this clear apricot-amber brew. Lots of really nice arcs of lace stick diligently to the glass. This stuff looks sticky!  S - Big time zesty and zingy fruit on top of massive hops. Apricot, lime, canned mandarin oranges, and blossoming flowers. This has a really lively and summery aroma that reminds me of what melting Skittles smell like. Remember those fruit shaped candies that require you to pump a quarter in a gum ball type machine to get like five little pieces? This smells like those little colorful hard candies. This could almost be marketed as a summery fresh laundry detergent scent. I'd buy it.  T - Zesty lime spritz is the first thing I taste. This is followed by massively citric hops that retain some semblance of pine, while being made up almost entirely of lime and orange rind flavors. I like this, but while it made the nose lively and exciting it makes the flavor a little bit awkward. I'm nitpicking here, because this is a damn tasty brew.  M - Extremely viscous and full bodied. This feel is nice, but almost seems to contradict the summer fruity flavors...even if those summery flavors are riding a wave of serious hop muscle. After the initial tart-sweet citrus, the mid palate is a very bitter ""chewing on orange rind"" flavor, while the finish is more traditionally hoppy and dank.  D - Not in the top tier of DIPAs, but IMO most DIPA's are top tier beers in their own right as this is one of my favorite styles. I wouldn't choose this as a session tool, but I'd buy this again for sure. I find DIPAs ...including this one...to be very nice sipping beers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,peabody,4.35,Pours out yellow to abmer/ornage with just a hint of white suds. Good lacing. Smell is hops and more hops. Very sweet hops as opposed to the Three Floyds Dreadnaught. These hops aren't as grapefruity but more mellow. Taste is very mellow for this good smelling of an IPA. Sweet maltyness followed by a bitter hop slam and finally the alcohol feel in the back of the throat. Very good. Mouthfeel is just a little oily and not really enough pine for my taste. Great beer but a little strong to be sessioning a bunch at a time.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,PatrickJR,4.7,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into nonic pint glass.  A - Somewhere between clear yellow and amber, with a nice 2-3 finger head. Decent retention before falling to a thick white cap and great lacing.  S - Very unique. Familiar leafy/slightly piney hops, but there's also a blast of fruit in here as well. Stone fruits stand out, particularly apples with some pineapple or perhaps banana coming through. A nice mild butter/caramel aroma from the malt provides a backbone for the hops.  T - Completely not what I expected, nothing like what I'm used to, which is probably what makes this absolutely amazing and hands down one of the best five brews I've ever tasted. Big pine flavor starts things off, and veers to a mild earthy note. Suddenly, all the fruit from the nose kicks in and there's a definite tropical presence, lychees and pineapples stand out, mingling with a vanilla-like biscuit flavor from the malt. Arguably the most beautiful part of this beer. Very slight but noticable alcohol component and a quick grapefruity bitterness which all too often dominates hoppy beers is only present for a moment near the finish, and a slight bitterness carries over to the aftertaste just as a reminder of what this brew really is.  M - Moderate to high carbonation with a nice medium body. Excellent.  D - I'm used to DIPAs being a little thicker and darker, but this is in a whole different league. It doesn't taste like any other DIPA I've had. This is one of my new favorite beers. It's fairly mild for an ""extreme style"" yet does things in the realm of taste that I could only imagine. An exceptional beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

A trace of malts present-caramel taste noted. Taste: Hops kick ass immediately, though not overly bitter. Piney/citrus taste noted in the hops. Malts keep this brew very smooth and help balance out the hops nicely. Mouthfeel: Ultra-smooth feel. Drinkability: Great especially for the hop fans, though the ABV and nature of the beer may limit the drinker to only a couple per session.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Great aroma.  Piny hops flavor and surprisingly enough some malt up front. It's nice to taste the malt as the rest of the flavor is dominated by the hoppiness. Biscuit malt flavor, slightly sweet but does not over do it.  Medium mouth feel, not rather crisp but none the less enjoyable.  A drinkable as a DIPA comes. Very nice brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

S- There is a nice sweet hoppy aroma. I really can't smell much other then that.  T- The hop taste is nice and sweet. I can taste a sort of bread taste for the maltyness.  M- This is a bit chewy and it definitely allows you to spit good loogies when you are done.

Plenty of lacing though.  S - Pine for the most part, with a touch of sweetness.  T - The strong malt backbone makes its presence known up front with plenty of hops coming through in the finish. Flavors include pine, grapefruit, and maybe a touch of lemon. The alcohol hides itself very well.  M - Medium-bodied, wet finish, the hops leave a bitter citrus aftertaste. Again, the alcohol remains hidden.  D - An incredibly well-balanced beer, probably one of the most balanced double IPAs I've had.

T- Tastes of Grapefruit, oranges and pine hops, finishes hop heavy.  M- Somewhat heavy in the mouth due to high amount of very fine carbonation.  D- Great beer especially for the price. It runs directly in line with the label which describes "" A Very Hoppy Ale."" For those who enjoy a slightly more hop centric DIPA without it being overwhelming this would be ideal.

345,14916,Radar,3.89,"Wow, isn't that an experience?  The color is a nice mild amber for an IPA, with a good head and a pantload of lacing. Seriously, I can't remember a beer that coats the glass like this. The smell... wow. Strong hoppy pines, and a bit of citrus, plus a lot of malt that smells like... I can only call it raw dough. Not in a good way. Look at the label. It's the dough that guy would make without access to the things you'd need to make dough. Damn near put me off the beer altogether. Good thing I tasted it.  The hop hits beautifully, nice piny flavor, moves to citrus, then back to the pine. It finishes with a twinge of that dough flavor, but... it works perfectly, somehow. I don't think I've ever hated the way a beer smells and then loved the way it tastes like this before. It's almost better because it smells so bad.  It's got an oily feel, even for an IPA, but again, somehow it works. I wouldn't call it a session beer, I'd go with Hop Devil for that, but it's a damn nice beer and conversation piece. I feel like I'm rating it low for as much as I enjoy it, but everyone should be warned that there may be parts of this brew that you'll have to fight your way through to get to the good stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

S: Smell is of fresh hops, grapefruit, other citrus, sweet bready malt. Very nice. I want to drink it.  T: And I did! It tastes of citrus and earthy hops, bready malts, grapefruit, orange rind and maybe a touch of honey. When the beer finishes, all you taste is crisp clean water. Friggin Amazing.  M: Medium bodied brew that is very creamy. The brew really lets you know the hops are there by letting them mingle in your mouth throughout the brew. Even when it finishes of clean water, the brew leaves a nice hop aftertaste. There is some alcohol burn though, watch out.  D: Very good brew all in all. Tastes great, smells great. It is a bit heavy in ABV, so you probably don't want to kill a sixer in a night.

Color looks really light for a double IPA, at least the double IPAs I'm used to. Something tells me this really is going to be a hop wallop.  S - Hoppy, but not ridiculously so. Some minor notes of sweetbread.  T - Juicy hop noticeable - but this is not really anywhere near as unbalanced as I thought it might be. There's a definite slug of malty sweetness. In fact it's quite sweet. No worries, though, the bitterness doesn't waver.  F - I like the feel. Ample but very soft carbonation, and little to no hop astringency.

Smell is hoppy-- piney, citrusy, and clean. Thin pale malt caramel sweetness lurks behind the hoppy bouquet, but never attempts to break their stronghold on the nose.  Taste is rich with caramelly pale malt up front, blown out of existence by hoppy orange, dried tangerine, sticky-green, pine-sappy oily hop flavors.

Pours about the same as on draft, golden with a decent head, but the cask head is a bit rockier. The smell and taste are about the same as well, with delicious citrusy hops and enough malty sweetness to underline the hops and contribute its own juicy fruitiness to the equation. The smoothness imparted by the cask, however, is out of this world! I wanted to gulp this stuff and drink glasss after glass. I definitely had a bit more than I was planning to, its just that good. The creaminess and lower carbonation of the cask really allow the juicy flavors to shine. What a beautiful experience.

345,14916,biegaman,3.98,"A toxic toned complexion misted in gentle orange haze; something like an orange juice with the pulp. What looks like a vibrant colour trying to shine through is stuck in overcast. The head just can't support itself and collapses instantly after swirling. All considered, the beer seems dismayed.  The aroma smells more like a German pilsner; my nose is most certainly not walloped with hops. Sugary, caramel laced malts yes; but tangy, fruity zesty hops, no. This might be welcome to a lager, but a DIPA? Ouch, my feelings are hurt, I've been terribly mislead.  The body has a lot of sticky, residual feeling from both the hops and malts. A vinous, plant type astringency leaves a zesty imprint from the hops while the heavily toasted malt carries a burnt toffee like texture. This being said, the one aspect that is still, strongly, working in the beer's favour is drinkability. It keeps the alcohol hidden and disappears fast.  While drinking the beer is no problem, finding much flavour can be a hard task. Foremost is a biscuit, cookie like malt bill, more common in English Pale ales. The hops are faint and have none of the tangy, piney, citrus fruity element that I remember so well.  Hop Wallop was originally one of my favourite DIPA's. While it has been some time since I first tried it, I don't think my expectations could have changed this much! I could do nothing but praise this beer, now I can do nothing but scratch my head...  Perhaps this is a case of a new brewer and the 'newer batches aren't as good the older batches' grievance; or more likely this bottle is simply out of date. Maybe still, newer bolder brewers have since last raised the bar and augmented expectations for the style...  Whatever the case - this is most definitely not how I remembered it.

A thick foamy head coats the top of the glass and laces in strata as I consume it.  S: The aroma is peppery with lots and lots of citrus. The cask has softened up the hops but they are still the focal point of the ale.  T: The ale is quite piquant, spicy and delicious with an intense hop presence. The cask has softened up the initial bite without detracting from the overall hop profile. The hops are citrusy with a lasting flavor that can't be avoided. The caramel malts nicely support the hops without getting in the way.  M: Mmmm, hops. This is by far Victory's hoppiest ale and what a great taste it has.

Has a decaying sweet smell I believe is the combination of the malt and citric hop aroma. Not something that really tells me to drink this.  It is a hoppy ale but it isn't an all or nothing hop bomb. It does have a solid malt background but overall it is a very sweet flavor. I think my sample is past peak in terms of freshness so it may have lost some of the special hop bite that is important to hop bombs.  Has a very robust body that I would say is on the heavier side of medium. Carbonation is good and not harsh.  Not a beer that I would drink more than one a night.

Solid offering, a little weak though compared to other DIPA's.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,kevinglin,4.08,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a straight-sided glass. No date on bottle.  Very clear, golden in color, with a tight-knit off white head that laced the glass and stayed around for quite a while.  Spicy, floral pronounced hop aroma - what did you expect from a ""Hop Wallop""?  Taste - a bit of toasty/breadiness in the malt that is strong enough to stand up to the strong hop presence. Hops dominate, but nicely balanced by the malt backbone.  Medium-bodied with lively carbonation. Smooth moutfeel that belies the 8.5% ABV.  I'd definitely reach for another Hop Wallop - recommend.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,albern,4.25,"This was an eminently drinkable and enjoyable IPA. The beer has a nice creamy consistency, medium bodied, loads of hop, and a nice pungent and mouth puckering tartness. The hop is resinous, oily, piney, and tart. There is some florals and grapefruity pungency that made the experience all the better. I appreciate the bready, biscuity malty creaminess in the rear. The lacing, appearance, aroma, finish, and aftertaste are all worthy of a fine IPA. The went down very smoothly on a hot summer day and the high ABV was well masked.

345,14916,RJLarse,3.31,"Purchased in a specialty shop. $2.65 a bottle. Poured in to a pint tumbler.  Pours a deep copper/gold color and is hazy. Foamy off-white head is fairly resilient, and laeves some lacing on the sides of the glass.  The smell is very faint, and not what I expected. Some faint pine scents, and that is about it.  Taste is predictably hoppy. There is a little sweet malt presence, but you have to feel for it. Taste is a bit one-dimensional.  Mouthfeel is smooth, a bit syrupy, with an absence of carbonation. A little heat in the aftertaste.  Not the most drinkable brew, but double IPAs rarely are. The ABV is too high to be sessionable, and the taste is not particularly interesting beyond the ""pucker factor."" If you are a hop head you'll love it, if you are not in to extremes you might prefer something else.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,rodcom,4.82,"This is one of my favorite beers! I drank it first right at the Victory Brewing Company several months ago (before they close for renovations), so I bought a case. This beer is just so full of hops and it can't be compared with anything else.  Go buy this beer right away you will love it.  Just tried it on cask at Victory and I liked it even more then out of a bottle as a result raised my scores.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jeonseh,4.15,"from a bottle and poured into a Tulip glass  A - golden yellow that is rather clear and clean looking. Can see a never ceasing trail of bubbles floating upwards. One finger clean and bright white head that pours to a finger and settles there for most of the beer.  S - The nose at first smells rather floral to me. However, it does seem to have big hints of tropical fruits as well as I noted pineapple and mango in there. There is also a small hint of pine that I notice that makes the beer smell a bit like a tropical Christmas tree.  T - At first, I got a bitter punch of pine hops that hit the tongue.That first note of hops is the main time the hops and bitter flavors of the beer come in. Also notice the sweet taste of fresh mango that comes in to calm the taste of the pine. I should note though that this beer definitely is not sweet though despite the sweet taste of the mango as it has a nice balance between the two flavors. I thought that the beer has a nice balance; however it seemed a bit muted for the ABV  MF - I would say that on the whole this was the best aspect of the beer IMHO. The body was full without being overly heavy. There was not stickiness at all but instead the beer was rather creamy and smooth. It just comes in rolls over the tongue before leaving you with a hop resin residue that remains lingering on your taste buds.  D - Overall a nice beer that I can't believe is 8.5% as you really get no hint of the alcohol anywhere .The flavors is nice and balanced and the mouthfeel is perfect. If it were not for the ABV, I could easily see myself sucking down a few of these in a night. Yet, no matter how much I might want to do that, the ABV would make it one hellish night if I did.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Smells of pine, grapefruit, oranges, lemon, caramel, and slight biscuit notes. Tastes of sweet honey and thick caramel with lots of grapefruit along with some citrus rinds like orange and lemon with a pine dry finish and some alcohol. Medium in body with perfect carbonation for a cask. Really sweet and bitter with a nice dry finish and some alcohol presence, but not too strong or commanding. A great IPA almost always tastes better on cask and this one is no exception. Lots of great hop flavors but not nothing but hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,tayner,4.23,"12 oz bottle  poured golden color with a big, white sticky head that laced nicely.  Smell was an earthy and floral hop profile with some sweet malts.  Taste was mostly earthy hop, but well balanced with some mild maltiness. THere was a finish that was a bit more citrusy hop. It seems to be one of the most mild double ipas i have had.  This had plenty of carbonation and was light to medium body without being watery. very nice hot weather beer  I could drink these all day long, but the 8.5% would catch up to me. It is one i need to get more of soon though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,WYVYRN527,3.97,"Victory has always produced good beer. This one is great, but it still has it's flaws. The beer pours a clear golden color, with good carbonation at first. However after dissipation of the head, tiny champagne-like bubbles are all that remain. On the nose is white cedar and pine nuts, followed by a hint of citrus. While not nearly as hoppy as other double IPAs I have sampled, it definitely shows some potential. Upon contact with the tongue, there is a slightly bitter floral flavor finished by a light hint of lemon peel. Most of the double IPAs I have tasted are very intense while young, and benefit with age. The Hop Wallop is one I would suggest drinking right away. It is mellow, yet intense enough to please those who love hops. It's at its peak upon release. Bill and Ron produce some great brews, and this one is amongst the best they have done to this day. However, It has not yet been perfected. The best thing about this beer is the fact that since it's first release they have not changed much about it. Unlike other double IPAs that have been ""Honeyed up"". For those who want to try something new and very good right off the bat, I definitely reccommend trying this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,allergictomacros,4.61,"A - Maybe an ever-so-slight haze on a gold liquid. Head is dense and copious. Laces well as well.  S - Slight funk in this, with a sweet malt underneath. Surprisingly, hop aroma is muted and a strong alcohol comes through.  T - Wallop indeed. Ridiculous hoppiness, raw but not coarse. Pine and citrus by the bucketload. Also here is spades is alcoholic complexity and just enough malt to balance out the two.  M - Slick, substantial mouthfeel. Low carbonation.  D - Way too drinkable for such a big brew. One of the best DIPAs I've had. Victory is definitely becoming my favorite brewer. My only complaint would be the lack of hoppiness in the nose.

A nice golden color with a two finger head that dissipates fairly quickly, leaving a thing ring of foam. Aroma of resiny hops, grapefruit, and some alcohol. Taste hits with you resiny hops, citrus hops, and a little malt sweetness underneath. Mouthfeel is right in the middle and coats my mouth nicely. This goes down quite easy for a DIPA, making it pretty drinkable. Overall this a beer that starts off hoppy, but ends up being quite balanced. I'm into it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,Hokies,3.73,Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a nonic glass. Pours a deep gold color and appears darker than other Doubles with a one inch head that leaves some lacing on the glass.  S: Awesome floral aroma of citrus hops with a hint of grapefruit and pine.  T: Very intense at first as the hops wack the pallet. The pine and the citrus hops hit you right away but the taste becomes a little less intense as the malt kicks in. Finishes nice with a decent bitter after taste.  M: Nice carbonation with an oily feeling.  D: One of these is nice but I think it would be tough for me to drink more than one.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,demcorhip,3.88,"Thanks to chonyr for bringing this north. Slightly paler than most IIPAs with its brilliantly clear golden body. Capped by a nice two and a half finger off white head that wants to stick around and leave sticky gobs of lace, which it gladly does as i enjoy my brew.  Aroma is a bit of a let down, then again was probably fresher and hoppier in the fall versus now. Biscuit and caramel, hints of grapefruit, pine and a touch of a slightly rank musky smell.  Some toasty malts also make their way into the biscuity malts along with the touch of caramel. Despite the pale colour the malts are solid in this brew, but are overpowered by the hops. Will be keeping my eyes open to try a fresher sample next fall. Still a fairly hoppy brew, almost resinous, with a decent amount of white grapefruit and pine.  Medium bodied, decent tea like astringency, and a decent amount of hops, with a nice balance of flavour and bitterness despite being a few months away from a fresh sample. Difficult to read the enjoy by date, but this bottle is still within the time frame.  Goes down very easily, only a hint of alcohol warmth betrays its 8.5% abv. A solid IIPA that reminds the drinker that beer is made form malted barley too, but certainly focuses on the the hops. A solid IIPA that is well worth trying, i dont mind the cat pissy skunkiness that comes along with the wallop.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,ZimZamZoom,4.2,"This beer is a nice deep gold color, clear with a huge white head that does not relent. Nice looking beer for sure.  Big citrus blast in the nose, with some mildly sweet malt hiding behind but not totally lost. A stroll through the grapefruit orchard after an electrical storm, the air is alive with citrus making the nose hairs tingle with joy.  Big citrusy hop flavor as well...pick up a fallen fruit from the above mentioned orchard. Bite through it rind and all. Mmmmm. All the while the citrus is hitting me the malty good smoothness is standing behind me poking me, saying ""I'm still here too"". Easy to lose it but when you look for it it's there. Hard to call this balanced considered the name, but it is by no means hop juice either. The hops are bold and in your face, but this is not a one horse show. good long bitter hop finish. You can feel the hairs on your chest growing. Each and every one.  Nice body and feel in this beer, smooth despite the bitterness. Drinkable? Of course, I drank this one.

It's not as bold as some, and although there's a hop wallop, some quality malt does come through.  M: Moderate body is well-attenuated & smooth, with plenty of hop acidity.  D: Very drinkable for its strength.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,hustlesworth,4.15,"A- surprisingly clear and light in color, a shiny brass or light honey, similar to an imperial pilsener. head is off-white and dense and is already leaving creamy waves of lace just from the pour. a few bubbles rise here and there and the foam falls fast to a very thick ring of melted ice cream. one thing i like is the fractal patterns of lace that slide down as i tilt the glass to drink. it's a surreal little ring of constantly morphing bubbles that ultimately meet their demise in the sea of hoppy insanity.  S- seriously fruity and herbal, red grapefruit, tangerine, rosemary, passionfruit, unripe melon, guava, and fresh pineapple. there's a lightness to the malt aroma with a lack of caramel, possibly due to the german malts used. doesn't bother me at all, because the hops are clearly showcased here. there is a toasted bread/biscuit quality with notes of earthy dried wood.  T- and what a wallop it is. it really fells as if i just drank straight hop juice. a nice cracked grain/cereal taste comes on in the beginning but is soon overtaken by some alcohol and a big slam of herbal resinous hops, possibly of the columbus variety? you only get a quick taste of the fruity aroma before the bitterness shuts down the whole system leaving only a faint graininess behind. the finish is long and progressive moving from insanely bitter to malty to woodsy to pine, and some of the citrus flavors finally make their way back out.  MF- astringent, dry, and warm in the mouth, but a little lighter than i expected. i typically think of imperials as being thick and murky, but this is a nice change from the ordinary, and gives the beer a more refined feeling. medium carbonation is light and prickly and dissipates fast, and is perceivably the vehicle that carries the malt flavors, because as the bubbles fade on the tongue, they do too. finish is dry and alcoholic and a little oily, and anyone who loves the world's tastiest vine will appreciate it.  D- dangerous D. with all the tropical fruitiness goin on, the rest of the flavor profile has a clean crisp lager character to it, and if one is not overwhelmed by bitterness, he might find himself treating old horace as a gulper, not a sipper.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ckeegan04,4.1,A - Clear orange color with thin white foamy head. Moderate lacing.  S - Fruity hops. Almost tropical smelling more so than the normal citrus smell you get from so many IPA's.  T - Very well balanced malts and hops. Fruity sweetness up front quickly overwhelmed by some nice hops bitterness. Wasnt very impressed with the taste at first but as it warmed it quickly got better.  M/D - Full mouthfeel and very well balanced between the hops and malts. Makes for a drinkable beer.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,KeefD,3.97,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a chilled pint glass. Slightly hazy almost macro in color, but with enough amber tones to make it look more appealing. Nice two-finger head and sticky lacing make me want to dive right in.  Nose is BIG and hoppy with tons of floral and citrus notes pounding the nostrils.  Taste up front is strong and bitter with piney hops, citrus flavors and very mild sweet malts to round it out, only to have the bitter hop flavor cling to the back of your throat.  There's good carbonation in this beer, full bodied and powerful. Drinkability is lower because the ABV is so high and the hop presence is overwhelming to say the least. The name isn't misleading; It packs a punch. This one is good to sip on.... one at a time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,beavers,3.85,"A: Pours a clear deep golden body with a big two fingered creamy head. Looks more like an imperial pilsner. Sticky,noticeable lacing down the sides  S: Huge citusry, floral hop aroma. Smells of lemon zest, sweet hop resin, and a strong grainy backbone. Has an aroma that almost like a sharp cheddar cheese.  T: Taste of sweet (honey) malts and citrusy hops in the front and then a long pine-needle hop bitterness. Missing some of the hop complexity I've grown to love in big IIPAs.  M: Creamy medium-to-full bodied with a big carbonation that feels right.  D: The alcohol is definitely kept in check, but the strong hop bitterness would keep me from enjoying more than maybe two of these.  A very good brew without a doubt. I enjoyed this fresh several months back and I remember the hops having a bit more juicy flavor before the bitterness takes over. Still a noteworthy and impressive beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Visible carbonation was very light.  S: The nose was strong and grassy with fresh cereal grains and a light citrus.  T: The initial flavor was sweet malt, grains followed quickly by a big grassy hopping. Dry grassiness definitely dominants the flavor with a light lemon twist is detected on the fade as well some fresh grains.  M: light, slick, with a sour citrus and big grassy lacing.

345,14916,brewdoc75,3.4,"I found this a little later on in the year, so I can't be sure about the freshness. For 8.99 a 6 pack it was worth it though.  Pours a nice light orangish yellow color w/ a soft white creamy head. The aromas are quite pleasant w/ some sweet scents present first, followed by some piney, citrusy hops. Very vibrant and exciting. Unfortunately the flavor of this beer does not follow suit. The hops are denitely there in bitterness, but not so much in flavor. Don't get me wrong they are there, just not as much as I'd like in a DIPA. The thing that knocks the score down in this beer for me is the presence of buttery diacetyl. Maybe this is a bad batch or its been sitting too long, but this is definitely a flavor I didn't expect or want in this beer. The mouthfeel is good. A bit syrupy, but crisp.  Overall a slightly above average DIPA. I'm only saying that because I feel I got an old batch. THis batch definitely not as good as this beer could have been. I had it on tap earlier this year but was too drunk to remember what it was like. From what I remember it was much better than this.

345,14916,paigertx,4.35,Great bottle design and poured a respectable head with pale color. Aroma not overbearing but makes your mouth water. Flavor has an ideal hop flavor for a 8.5% ABV which does not taste like it has that strength. Wish I could try this one from cask. Victory has done well.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,madmanjf,4.17,"I had this on cask, gravity pour, day two of being opened.  The beer was surprisingly clear with a lot of carbonation; approximatley one inch head with a lot of volitility immediately after being poured. The head drops down quickly but about a quarter inch of head remains with some nice lacing throughout the life of the pint.  There wasn't a specific aroma that stuck out easily, which I found surprising for a double IPA. Aside from the basic citrus and pine smell, there really wasn't much else coming through to the nose.  I had a very difficult time distinguishing tastes as well; in fact, combined with my difficulty in picking up aromas, I'd probably flag this for a second review on my part in case I was off that night. Nonetheless, this beer tasted great. Light, sweet hoppiness with some light malt and a bitter but quick finish.  The hops left a sweet stickness in the mouth, which was very interesting and welcomed. Despite the high carbonation, the beer was quite smooth and not acidic in feeling.  Overall, it went down quite easily, was very smooth, enjoyable and packed a wallop :)  I had two 20oz imperial pints.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jmalex,3.76,"Whoops, this was one of those beers that just got lost in the boxes and boxes I have. Better drink this quick before it gets older.  APPEARANCE: Pours a slightly darker than gold into a Victory shaker pint. It's only slightly hazy and is topped by a tight-bubbled eggshell-colored head that holds at almost a finger's height. This is what beer should look like.  SMELL: There's still some big time hop aroma on this. Citrusy and floral, the slightly resinous hops stand out quite a bit, but still allow some clean malty sweetness to come through.  TASTE: The hops resins come out way more in the taste and are a tad overwhelming. But Hop Wallop has balance on it's side, featuring a very solid sweet malt base on which the hops really show themselves. Alcohol is slightly detectable toward the finish.  MOUTHFEEL: Big bodied and a bit syrupy and slick. Carbonation is at average appropriate levels.  DRINKABILITY: The balance helps here a lot, but it's brought down by the alcohol and slickness of the body. One bottle is just the right amount for me.  Not bad at all. I've had it before but never got the opportunity to sit down with one. There's so many great DIPA's out there, I don't know if I'd buy more of this, but since they're one of my local breweries, I'm sure I'll be drinking more Hop Wallop sometime in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,tiger88,3.88,Poured 12 oz bottle into an imperial pint. Good looking hazy orange color. Bright white head hung around for quite some time. The nose was not overwhelming as one would imagine for a DIPA. Subtle notes of hops nevertheless. Tasted great for a DIPA even though my wife claimed to taste soap. Good earthy taste and the alcohol and hops don't overwhelm. Went down smooth and would be easy to drink a few on a hot summer day. I'll get it again when I travel out of Alabama!!!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,dnichols,4.1,Thanks to abankovich for a great trade. I poured a capped 12 ounce bottle into a tulip.  A: It poured a hazy and orangeish golden body with a carbonation fed modest white head that retained well and left clumps of lacing that fell back into the liquid.  S: It had a powerful hop profile that was rich with pine and citrus. There was a recessive aroma toasted malts and white fruit and spices.  T: It hit with a hop bomb composed of pine and grapefruit. There is no doubt this is an Imperial IPA. After the hops receded there was a undercurrent of tasted malts and tart white fruits (white grapes and pears).  M: It was a medium bodied beer that despite its hop dominance was smooth and refreshing. It had a nice clean finish with just hints of sour aftertaste.  D: I'm not a hop head but this goes down pretty good. Decent management of hops but perhaps a bit over the top. A bit more balance would have improved the experience.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Proteus93,4.35,"A: A clean golden/amber pour sporting a decent creamy white head.  S: A surprisingly gentle aroma, primarily all hops... floral, citrus, a little piney.  T + M: Not as gentle as the aroma, but I would hope not! Nonetheless, it carries a very delicate grouping of flavours... oily pine, grapefruit peel citrus, and a bit of a malty roast manages to sneak in there. The big flavours leave their signature along the sides and back of the tongue on the finish, all along bringing a sensation as though the papillae are standing on end. The lightest zip of carbonation adds to the sensation for quite a pleasing mouthfeel.  D: I'll have another, without a doubt. While perhaps it's not an absolute favourite, it's an excellent brew. With all the other flavours going on, the alcohol is hidden fairly well, so one could potentially over do it on this one. Keep it slow, enjoy it as it really opens up... it might have some attitude, but can be a great 'companion beer' if you respect it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,becktone,4.45,"Eye: Poured into a pint glass this beer is orange in color with golden yellow highlights. Head retention and size are great. Given the abv, I'm surprised that it can hold a head this size for such a great amount of time. In color it is off white and creamy textured.  Nose: Vinous, citrus, floral and grapefruit aromas fill my nose. Aroma reminds me quite a bit like white sparkling grape juice. Underneath these aromas there is a good strong malt backbone. Very appealing to the olfactory senses.  Tongue: Nice hop bite right off the bat. Bitterness is intense but not in the face. Big floral and citrus notes from hops mingle along with vinous/grapefruit/sparkling grape juice flavors-I'm assuming these are from hops too-to create a great hop profile here...Maybe some of that sparkling grape juice comes from alcohol on the other hand, not sure. Also some spiciness. The flavor of alcohol is detectable. Not too much malt flavor here, either that or my palate is too desensitized to taste it by now-perhaps a bit of a coarse graininess.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The brew is medium bodied with nice levels of carbonation that give it some real life. The finish is dry, leaving the palate filled with hop flavors. This beer is great, I'll definitely be buying it again, however it didn't really ""wow"" me like Maharaja did, but it is right up there with it... it is a damn good beer.

345,14916,Dalem,4.4,"A dark clear orange in color with a one fingered head that fades pretty quickly but leaves almost a blowing and drifting snow looking lace on the glass. The hop scent wasn't as stong as I expected it to be but it is there along with earthy and grapefruit aromas. Though the hop scent isn't that detectable in the smells they sure do in the taste. Tart and sweet like a grapefruit is what you taste in the front end of the flavor. The grapefruitness of it is one more of the ruby red kind than say, your standard white or pink varieties. In some ways it also reminds me a bit of a pilsner with a huge hop profile. Some pine notes though bring you back though to remind that this is an IPA. A slight herbal bitterness follows it up giving it a dry kick in the back end but still not a burn that one would likely expect from something bordering the 9% abv mark.  The dude on the label sure looks like he knows how to party too.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,mountdew1,4.2,"Poured into a standard pint glass. Color was a golden amber hue with a fluffy 1 finger white head. Head clung to the sides of the glass with a ring around the edge. Aroma was piney with a touch of citrus. Taste was sprucey and tangey with a bit of orange. Felt good in the mouth, a little bit of bitter carbonation but clung very well. Easy to drink but the alcohol did appear to hit faster than I would have thought.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Pencible,4.67,"This poured a mostly clear golden color with noticeable sediment and a fluffy white head. It smelled like a mix of pine and floral hops. Its flavor was bitter but not over the top, using a mix of pine and orange hops balanced with some malt. It was thick and oily with some slight carbonation, and it had a smooth and bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very tasty beer, and surprisingly drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,travloh,2.89,"With the cartoon guy on the label and the hokey catchphrases(contents: hops, hops, and more hops!) I was skeptical.  poured into standard pub glass at about 53 F.  Wow. surprisingly light in color. Straw colored. Clear. little carbonation. Good head forms immediately.  I don't know if it is just me, but i don't get much of a smell from this stuff. Very faint hops....  I taste the bitter hops on the back of my tongue, but it just seems like this needs some balance. The 8.5 abv seems pretty well masked. I can taste the alcohol but not like you would think. To be completely fair I let it warm up to 60 F or so and taste some more....not much difference.  Overall this stuff is decent. I would gladly drink another, but not sure I will go out of my way to get it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,IgotsHops,4.18,"Saw this at Whole Foods in Seattle and have been dying to try it. Poured VERY clear into my pilsner flute. Impressive clarity. Head was average and white.  Strong hop aroma with citrus and floral being forward. Some clean pine as well. Wished there was more malt to balance the hops on this one, was disappointed with the body, but it led to a really light DIPA. I thought I was just drinking a standard IPA.  Overall I could drink a couple bottles of these, which I don't think is what should happen with a DIPA in my opinion. It just didn't fight back enough. Well crafted beer and worth a try, I might buy it again, but I still have other DIPA's I prefer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Very light citrusy hops & malt.  T- Fermented hop tea. Very bitter finish. Given all the hype, I kinda expected something a bit better balanced. This was pretty average.  M- Moderately carbonated with very strong, lingering bitter taste at the finish.  D- I'm not a huge fan of the over-hopped beers, but I thought it was reasonably drinkable. The 8.5% is well hidden.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Pours a bit more hazing than I would expect but a nice orange copper with a small white head that leaves a small ring at the top of the glass.  Strong, but pleasant, hops hits your nose with the pour. Some citrus, maybe grapefruit, tones come from the aroma too.  Nice bitter hops comes through as it hits your mouth upon tasting. Some floral hints and the citrus comes through too.  Finishes in a nice bitter manner-dry and smooth and wanting more on your tongue.  Nicely balanced for a double IPA and not too overpowering really. I'd have another one of these for sure, but I think that I'd only be able to have two or so in a session because of the ABV and also the effect of the hops on my tongue!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Phillyduke,4.02,"** NOTE: This review is of an ""aged"" bottle from the Fall '06 release. Label indicates ""Enjoy by Oct 24 07."" Ooops... **  Appearance: A cloudy and pale straw orange color with a one-finger head that quickly dissipates leaving a fine layer on the surface of the beer. Moderate lacing.  Smell: Honey, pine, malt.  Taste: Most dominant is the sweetness of honey followed by malty undertones. The hops have been relegated to supporting cast members, with hints of pine and citrus. Finish is lengthy and bitter on this medium-bodied brew.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy. Coats the mouth well and lingers after each sip.  Drinkability/Overall Impression: Age has certainly taken the edge off this beer, and from what I can remember, that's a good thing. When I bought this case in the Fall of '06, I found it to be nearly undrinkable due to the extremely mouth-puckering bitter characteristics. I like hoppy beers, but I found it to be all strength and no balance. I actually like what time has done, although I realize this was not the brewer's intention. I find that it has become more drinkable now (though not in large quantities due to the high ABV %) then it was when fresh, though I look forward to revisiting it again this coming autumn to see if my tastes have changed over the years.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Thanks SAS.  1"" head above a slightly hazy honey gold... pretty good lacing.. looks very promising.  Aroma is fruity and bready .. definitely more malts than hops... only slightly hoppy. Could this be old?  Flavor is better.. but only marginally. Descent bitterness.. subdued hop flavors with solid palate and carbonation. More fruity than hoppy across the board. Bitter backbone is present... but the hop flavor is WALLOPED by the yeasty fruitiness. There are remnants of citrus/grapefruit and pine.. but they are fleeting... Minerally finish. No Doubt.. nothing special.  This may be an aged bottle.. I will gladly delete this review if I score another bottle.. but for now, my previous (3) notepad reviews say the same thing, ""I want to be walloped with the hops. Hop Wallop does not do the job.""

S: Strong oily pine and citrus with a slight medicinal twang to it, if you want to imagine it mellon and mango are hiding within this beer with only the slightest hint of malt sweetness, but really I'm not looking for malts here.  T/MF: Quite juicy, strong citrus and mellon mango, deep sweet fruits and not that oily pine that was hinted at in the aroma, though bit of an alchol and pine peppery spice kick near the end, bitter and tasty, not a bad offering at all, certainly better than good. Mouthfeel is quite sticky and wish there was a bit more carbonation to round this beer out more fully, but damn if it does not want you to take another sip.

Taste fair amount of sweet initially masked by the bitter, piney and soapy hops. Leaves a bit of an oily hoppy bitterness coating over the entire tongue, and hops fade leaving the bitterness and the creamy sweetness reappears. Although quite bitter, it doesn't have a huge hop flavor, I thought, and comes with a bigger than average, but nice maltiness as well. Pretty good IIPA, I thought.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Aroma is of 'fresh squeezed hops', as I've put it before. Bright grapefruit and fresh citrus.  Strong pine. Reminds me of hiking through the Cascades and finding a campside hidden away in some valley. grapefruit, citrus, cannabis, and florals mixed in there too. Wonderful.  Crisp and medium body. Strong alcohol, but it's hidden nicely. Drinkability is there. This is a sipper though, at 8.5%, it's definitly not a session beer by any account. It'll wallop you!  One of my top 5 beers!

Aroma is grapefruity and floral hops. Mouthfeel a little thicker than water. Flavor is all hop all the time, though not as overwhelming and bitter a brew as might be feared. Woody, piney flavors dominate the citrus that's present. The battle leaves a long-lasting and agreeable bitter aftertaste. No malt character to speak of.

The nose is packed full of citrus hops scent. There is a subtle earthiness mixed, but I cannot pickup any malt background. I almost smell a bit of candied fruit as well. The flavor profile is heavy on the hops with flavors of ripe pink grapefruit and resinous pine dominate without much of a malt base to round things out.

Smells of citrus hops with subtle earthy qualities. Very creamy mouthfeel, not quite full bodied but a great silky feeling. Despite a bitter aftertaste, not many alcohol flavors despite the high content. Taste like it smells -- lots of citrus, and a good deal of hops I wouldn't necessarily call it a ""wallop"" but still a good amount. Drinkability is alright -- the transition from first palate taste to aftertaste is fast and doesn't allow for the citrus or hop flavors to linger very long.

The aroma is spicy, earthy and minty hops, with a sweet malt backbone with citrus and pineapple smells mixing in.  The flavor is minty and citrus hops rushing in with a sweep of malt and understated alcohol pushing away the first touch of hops followed by a smooth bitterness and lingering fresh hop flavor.  The beer is clean and has the perfect blend of malt and hops to make it a keeper. Medium mouthfeel, with a carbonation level that works to propel the hop bitterness just right.

Appearance: Poured this into my Duvel glass. The color was a golden orange/yellow hue with a thick 2 finger head that lasted for several minutes before dissipating into the glass.  Nose: Flowery hops and alcohol, a bitter citrus scent I would describe as grapefruit accompanied by big tropical fruit aromas, possibly mango. There is a minty Belgian yeast-like aroma that seems a bit out of place.  Taste: Hop Wallop is right, the hops hit you square in the face with the first sip. The finish lingers but unfortunately overall the taste is a bit one sided and I would prefer to see a bit more balance with the presence of a malt backbone.  Mouthfeel: Very rich, smooth consistent mouthfeel that if full of carbonation.

Complex hops mix - mostly grapfruit and pine. Very dry bitter finish that lingers for awhile. Very slight hint of sweet malt. Hops stomp out any chance of the formidable ABV that might try to come through.  Carbonation and body is moderate. A bit too bitter for me to really consider this drinkable.

Also: alcohol, though mild and grainy.  Taste is spicy, citrus, and grassy hops. Also I'm GUESSING some sort of English bitter and/or bready hops like Perle and Fuggle or something like that. Malts are also present, bready, light, and balanced well with the spicier hops. ALcohol isn't too bad.  Feels like a good IIPA. Thick, frothy, though not syrupy like darker brews.  As one drinks this brew, it gets better as the palate warms up. Very nice.

There's a respectable bitterness, but it's balanced by a sweet finish that keeps this from being a monster. Same citrus in the mouth that the nose picked up.

T: Initial taste on the tongue is light of pale malt and then - WHAM! There is a sudden burst of sharp and pleasantly bitter hops that just keeps rolling well past the finish. As the bitterness fades in the finish that pale malt hint of sweetness resurfaces.  M&D: Light to moderate mouthfeel with moderate carbonation that goes great with the sharp hop bite.

Smell is firstly hops.. the grassy, green, flowery hops. So wonderful. Caramel, molasses sweetness comes through at the end.  It tastes like a double ipa should, and is definitely a hop wallop. I was honestly expecting it to finish a little more bitter than it does, and for that I'm slightly let down. Piney hop profile as opposed to incredibly citric. Slight malty sweetness as you swallow, but tastebud-numbing hop oils remain.  It's a little thin, and quite carbonated, but the drinkability is through the roof for it being so ""light"".

Full force hop bitterness that makes the taste buds on the back of your tongue rise and applaud. High acidity and slight sour tinge slide across the front of the tongue.

S-Aroma is suprisingly mild but what is there is realy nice. grapefruit hops jump out and piney ols fill the middle, the finish is of sweet caramel malts and simple syrup.  T&M-Caramel and biscuit malt hit up front but are quickly pushed back by a brash hop bitterness. When I say brash un mean unabashed baby these things hit hard. Not harsh but brash. A big dose of grapefruit is the 1st punch, this is followed by a big left hook of bitter greens, the final blow is the pine. This one is the best leaving a really nice oily mouth coating. The body is medium and carries the flavor well. The carbonation is fizzy which reaks havoc on the pallet as the bitterness and popping bubbles interplay.

345,14916,DrinkinBuddy,4.47,Pours a nice golden orange with a 1 finger white head. Leaves ample lacing throughout. Smell is a total bouquet of floral and citrus hops. Taste is very piney and citrusy. A very nice hop bitterness stays on the palate long after you finish. Carbonation is very suttle and soothing. Very well done and a refreshing. Probably could be considered an IPA instead of a DIPA. But it's a very good brew anyway.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,MmmIPA,4.84,"2007 vintage.  Orange body with a small white head.It looks like its gonna leave some nice lacing.  Grapfruity,piney notes.  Nice and grapfruity with some nice bittering at the end.

345,14916,Homerbag,4.2,"Pours a light yellow, gold with big pillow head.  Smells citrusy, piney and very good. Tastes like pine, grapefruit, some light malt for balance. No detectable alcohol. Almost refreshing. Nice carbonation and pleasant aftertaste.  A nice beer. A little weak for a IIPA, but very very good and worth buying more than a couple times.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Tilley4,4.2,"Bottle courtesy of joeybeerbelly.  Pours a hazy orangish-yellow with a very fluffy white head. Looks fairly hazy.  Smells extremely hoppy and sweet. Nice mixture of citrus and pine hops blast the sense of smell.  Wonderfully hoppy sweet taste that is present in the true elite IIPAs. This is one tasty beer. I think it belongs with the true heavyweights in the style.  Got one more bottle left and I'm stoked. Thanks, Joe!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Atron67,4.42,"A- poured a huge fluffy white head and a crystal clear bottom. huge lacing throughout  S- huge citrusy sticky piney hops quite delicious,  T- piles of hops layered on top, awesome sticks with you throughout. clingy  M- medium carbonation, solid body  D- awesome, i shoulda picked up alot more",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Lothar666,4.08,"A- Light golden amber body, very cloudy with a tinge of orange. Head was foamy, creamy and three full fingers thick. This one displayed excellent head retention, leaving a thick sticky lacing around the edges of the glass.  S- Strong Citrus and floral accents; grapefruit, a bit of orange and lemon, and a strong presence of the hops that give this one its name.  T- Grapefruit and uber-strong hop bitterness right up front- so much so that the first sip almost numbs the pallet, making it neccessary to really search for those complex malt notes hidden in the background. These become apparent as the beer warms and can be best appreciated by holding a sip in ones mouth for about 3 seconds and then giving a gentle swish. Delicious!!  M- Somewhat dry and very refreshing- the abundant hop presence gives the mouth a pleasant tingle like a good IPA should.  D- Very drinkable for those conditioned to love the ""Hop Wallop"" that this brew is named for. Those new to IPA's or who don't enjoy what I call the ""Kick you in the teeth with hops"" effect that comes with super hoppy american style IPA's would do better to start with something a bit more tame and work their way up.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Gmann,3.83,"Pours a clear golden color with a decent pure white head that left a nice curtain of lacing on the glass. The smell is disappointing. Some nice grapefruit hop aroma but it is not as strong as I would expect a DIPA to smell. A nice piney and grapefruit hop blast to start things off. Which is followed by a light honey like malt. Definitely not a huge sweet malty presence like most DIPAs, which in my book is good as you get to taste the hops. The taste profile is more online with Stone Ruination, but not quite as hoppy. The feel is moderate with lively carbonation and finishes slightly sweet and quite bitter. I appreciate the 'not over the head malty sweetness' in this brew. It lets the hops be hops. This seems to me to be more of a serious IPA then a malty sweet DIPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,d0ggnate,3.78,"A greap IIPA for all the hopheads out there.  A:Yellow/golden to light with close to no head. S: Bitter hops... that's all I got.

IPA lovers rejoice!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,m1ked,3.88,"A- Light golden with a fine white foam. Notice alot of tiny bubbles streamers.  S- Grains. I smell wet barley, biscuity. Light alcohol.

This would be a multiple offender in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,dgallina,4.44,"12 ounce standard bottle without obvious dating.  Pours into the nonic pint a clear filtered gold color. Little head evident, but decent sticky lace hangs around. The beer smells crisp and fruity; bursting with complex mixed peach, grapefruit, pear, and pine hop notes. The flavor is equally refreshing for something so relatively strong. Initial earth and pine tastes turn into a peachy fullness in the center. Finishes medium-dry with alternating touches of hop bitterness and ongoing fruitiness. Some light alcohol vapors sneak in at the end. Coats the mouth with medium slipperiness and tickles the tongue all the way through. Surprisingly quaffable and quenching!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ffejherb,4.7,"12oz. bottle into DFH specialty pint glass on 1/28/08. My 100th beer review. Thanks to BA Deuane for this one!  A - Poured a clear, pale golden/amber colored body with mammoth two-finger rocky white head. Bubbles vigorously swirled to the top of the glass. Solid head retention and some very thick, ornate lacing.  S - Very pleasant bready malt aroma with some biscuity quality, sweet caramel and fruity citrus hops reminiscent of pineapple, grapefruit and orange. Some piney hops in the back, but overshadowed by the juicy fruit aroma and sweetness.  T - What a wonderful explosion of flavors! There is a brief sweet caramel and fruity aspect that quickly segues into a powerful citrus hop presence that is extremely well-balanced by a sturdy malt backbone that is sweet, bready and biscuity. Amazing!  M - Medium to full body with a warm, creamy texture with a bit of oily slickness to the mouthfeel. Sharp, bitter finish bites the tongue, but in a good way. Bitterness sticks to the tastebuds and is with you for the long haul.  D - I had this on tap at the Victory brewpub over a year ago, and didn't really care for it. What was I thinking? This beer is up there with Nugget Nectar... not quite as earth shattering, but certainly a worthy competitor. This is one tasty hop bomb!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,MMAJYK,4.35,"A- Bright yellow and golden color with light orange hues. Head is 2 fingers of rocky white head after an agressive pour. While drinking down, it leaves very sheety/sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.  S- Piney and Citrusy hops are the strongest smell. A little deeper and you pick up some butter like smells that smooth it all out.  T- Buttery caramel taste with bittering hops. The hops are citrusy and floral and leave the mouth dry and bitter.  M- Relativiely high carbonation and a sticky/oily mouthfeel.  D- Better take it easy on this one because it is very drinkable for a high ABV beer. Alcohol is well hidden.  Overall- One of my favorite of this style. Very hoppy, but refreshing at the same time. Complex tastes, but is very well rounded. This will continue to be a regular in my fridge.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jdubjacket,4.47,"As the name implies, there are some serious hops in this beer.  The first thing I noticed about this beer was the citrusy smell that emanates out of the bottle when it's opened. Tastes much like it smells. It's a bready, floral, citrus senstation that covers all bases of the DIPA. Absolutely outstanding. On a Friday or Saturday night, I can see myself polishing off a few of these.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,mnstorm99,3.88,"Nice light copper with a very white head that sticks to the glass all the way. Very good aromas of pine and floral hops, strong and inviting. Tastes are of Floral and spicey hops, not my favorites, but this was a good combonation none the less, nice malt backbone, but not as sweet or balanced as a typical DIPA. Great mouthfeel, perfectly carbonated with a nice chewy, creamy coating, I could sit and have a few of these, in fact I had three last night. Very good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,TheLiterati,4.58,"Warning: If you don't like the smell - or taste - of grapefruit, then I'd suggest you back away from this monster.  To be honest, I was a bit put off by the mostly golden color of this ale as I poured this baby into my glass. I guess I was expecting something with a bit more of an amber hue. Still the ivory head and nice lacing was encouraging so I went on to take a sniff.  Wow.  Pine and grapefruit - and a lot of it too, along with some spice.  The taste absolutely doesn't disappoint. Along with the citrus and pine, there's a peppery finish that has something of an after burn to it.  But beware - if you are not a serious hophead, or you're just beginning to appreciate the beautiful bitterness this flower has to offer, get ready to be absolutely pounded by a wave of flavors.  Sip to fully appreciate, allowing the complex flavors to slowly wash over your palate.  Definitely drinkable  again slowly and in moderation - as this ale packs a serious wallop!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

No alcohol in the nose.  T: More malty than I expected at first, but then the citrus and pine hops flavors take over. For a Double IPA, the balance is amazing yet it still retains the severe hoppiness you'd expect in a double IPA. The alcohol is evident but not at all prominent or overwhelming.  M: Very slick, medium-bodied, low-carbonation, and delicious, long hops aftertaste.  D: One or two is appropriate, but more than that and you could be in trouble at this ABV. Yet another exceptional creation by Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ziggy13,3.96,"Decided to finally review this one after sitting down to a nice bottle on a very boring Tuesday. Always a great seasonal from Victory. Here we go.  A - Light, golden orange in color. Very transparent with small fizzy bubbles of effervescence throughout. A very good looking brew.  S - Not as potent as I might like. I expected an almost overwhelming bouquet, but all I got was some light hop notes. It doesn't really give the proper idea as to what is coming next.  T - An abundant of hops dances on the palate. They didn't skimp on anything here. Very piney notes but the finish is a little grating. The pine notes linger a little longer than I would like. It really tastes like I'm biting into a hop flower. Very interesting indeed.  M - Medium bodied. Not too thick, not too thin. With each sip a little of the beer stays on your tongue giving you an intense experience.  D - Like most Double IPAs, i can really only have a few in a sitting. This one stands up well though and I think the second is always better than the first after your palate adjusts to the hopification. Really a great beer for its style but not my #1!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

As a big fan of almost all Victory brews, had high hopes from this one and heard a lot of good things... didn't disappoint... I would consider this the bigger, badder, older brother of Victory's Hop Devil... this one picks up where it left off, with a super-size serving of fresh hops that are immediately noticeable upon popping the top... rich, thick, pure hop flavor abounds with a candied-like bitterness that lingers on the palate... appearance is light bronze with visible carbonation... Aroma, as expected, is bursting with hops... good mouthfeel and didn't encounter the bitterness that I had expected... sweet finish with a pleasing after-taste... surprisingly easy drinkability for an 8.5% ABV, and as an Imperial IPA, this is certainly one of the better ones out there...

Tight head. I would like/expect a darker color for an IPA. S: Bready maltiness with a pungent hop aroma. A little alcohol comes through upon closer sniffing. T: Hops bite at first, then the malty sweetness erases all bitterness. Hops jump back in the ring to remind me that this is an IPA, then a balanced flavor of bread and grassy hops. At 8.5%, where is the alcohol? As a DIPA, where are the hops? This tastes more like a single AIPA, but a great one at that! However, when I drank it from the bottle, I tasted much more hops and much less malt. I enjoy it better from a glass as a more balanced flavor. M: Drying from hops, but maltiness moistens. An interesting dichotomy. D: Dangerously drinkable!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

S- Floral hops... piny notes... very earthy... citrus  T- Incredible taste... very complex... very well balanced hops. The malt catches your attention, yet doesn't pull you away from the delicious hops. Not quite as hoppy as say Dogfish Head...but for a double IPA I think that this is much more tasty than other doubles. The 8.5% ABV is NOT noticeable at all!  M-light/medium body... low carbonation that works because it interferes less with te taste.  D- Need I say more? The 8.5 will knock you on your butt before you ever taste it.... GREAT drinkability.

Plenty of bubbles rising quickly to the top, producing a full and bubbly white head that actually retains for awhile. Very slippery lacing that slides into the beer. S: Piney hops with a tangy citrus sweetness. Dry roasted sugars. Grassy, almost like straw. Nice hops, but not much to back it up. T: Calm pine and citrus up front. Middle is a continuation of that with a hint of sweetness. Finish actually lets out a tiny bit of malt that I hadnt noticed before, but the lingering taste is the same hops from the beginning. M: Dryish and hoppy/tingly but not biting. D: Okay. I suppose its easy to drink for a DIPA, but theres some alcohol tingle to it. Overall, an okay IPA, and it doesnt even feel like a double except for the afterfeel in the throat of the 8.5% ABV.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Its taste is immediately hoppy with citrus and piney flavors at the forefront. However, after the first hop-shock the flavor mellows quite nicely with a buttery smooth finish leaving little bitterness on the tongue.  As DIPAs go this is a pretty good one. I think I would take Great Divide's Hercules over this one, but this brew is pretty damn good. Hoppy, not harsh, and exceedingly drinkable for an 8.5 ABV.

345,14916,Morey,4.4,"I'd like to state up front that this review is from back when this was still a seasonal November release. Since Victory has gone year round with this beer, I've noticed a significant drop in freshness, and therefore the overall quality of the beer.  This beer produces a very nice 2 finger head when poured with a medium-agressive pour. Very pale, almost yellow Double Ipa with a slight haze to it. The head on this beer leaves nice circular rings around the inside of the glass as you drink it...very impressive!  Smells of pine and citrus fruits fill the nose.  The hops greet you at the door and never leave your palate. Very little in the way of a malt backbone or sweetness here. I love this beer!  Morey's Bottom Line: There is something refreshingly unique about this beer, without a doubt one of my favorite DIPA's on the market. A must buy every year. Highly recommended to hopheads!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,dickieb,4.38,"Pours an interesting amber color, with 3 fingers head. Lacing is off the charts. The smell is riddled with grapefruit and hop bite, and a hint of malt. Pine and citrus hops rule the flavor with grapefruit again being prominent. Some malt backbone, but this is still pretty much a hop bomb. The mouthfeel is right where it should be, as is drinkability. One of the better Dipa's i have had.

345,14916,illidurit,4.5,"Pours a nice goldenrod color with a perfect 2.5 finger head. The foam is very sticky on the glass and the retention is spectacular.  Aroma is of pungent tart grapefruit, some lemon tanginess, and a hint of malt sweetness.  A sip reveals the inevitable: this is a hop bomb. The citrus hops come out first, with faint toasty malt sweetness in the middle, and a wonderfully bitter finish.  Smooth, crisp, dry finish.

It's sweet and delicious hops tingle the senses. Great cohesiveness and continuity throughout the bottle. Great aftertaste. 4.5  Mouthfeel: Could be better, pretty light and watery, not much carbonation, no malt feeling. 4.0  Drinkability: I can drink these while I cover Knicks games!

Not much lacing but a very thin fine layer stays on top all the way down.  Smell: Deep herbal pungent hops, with malt in the back  Taste: Malty backbone comes up first but is quickly overtaken by a strong hop bitterness, fading out with more hops, borderline piney, herbal tasting hops. The bitterness does not leave the tongue quickly.  Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation blending into a full, creamy body. Well done.  Drinkability: Fabulous beer, but I probably wouldn't have more than one in a night, due to the assertive bitterness. Strange cause I tolerate many other high IBU beers better.

Nice balance between hops and malt. While this is a big hoppy beer is does not seem too  extreme. Grapefruit, lemon hop flavors predominate, and the sweetness from the malt does  come through especially when the beer is allowed to warm up a bit.  Missing some of the complexities such as caramel malts and an intense bitter hop foundation  of other double IPAs. Body and mouthfeel is on the light side.

345,14916,RoBotGod,4.47,The name says it all on this beer. It has the typical citrus lemon and green hop flavors but a few other characteristics come out as well. It almost has a sour apple tartness to it. This beer kind of reminds me of sour patch kids the candy. The alcohol is put just right at 8.5% and is not over powering. This beer is hard on the palate. Dont plan on tasting a whole lot after this. The overwhelming amount of hops in this beer is great for all hop heads. I find it odd this being a winter release.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ttu94,4.37,Well this is a fine brew! Clear yellow with a decent head and it leaves a plethora of lace all down the glass. The smell is absolutly wonderful. Full of hops. This beer may be the reason for the hop shortage it is so loaded with them. The hop flavor is very pine forest like (amarillo I guess). Leaves a little higher than normal bitterness but all in all a very highly drikable beer for a Double IPA.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Strong notes of piney, citrusy, and grassy hops abound. Taste took things to the next level.The hops are there and strong, but not overly bitter. The malt seems stronger than in the bottled version, and blends with the hops perfectly. The hops are more tasty than bitter and present a nice ending to this beer.

345,14916,marcpal,3.42,"After only having this beer from bottle, thought be a good time to review after having it on tap at Old Bay in NB. The hops are a bit overpowering in this form, may just be my imagination.  A: Light golden color with a cloud white head.  S: Citrus and flower hops. Not much else and not much else really expected.  T: Citrus hops and more flowery hops. This is just mind blowing hop flavor with the oily texture to match. The hopdevil on HGH.  M: Mild carbonation, fairly high for the style but insanely oily to the mouth.  D: Barely negligible alcohol level but the hop intensity does become burdensome.  This was not as good as previous experiences with this beer, just overdoing a bit on the hops with not as much balance as I was accustomed to.

345,14916,bluejacket74,3.43,"12 ounce bottle, says enjoy by 11/13/08. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a gold/orange color with about an inch white head. Head retention is low, lacing is very good. Aroma is pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops along with some lemon peel. Taste is similar to the aroma with the addition of a grainy taste to the beer. But the hops are in charge of this brew, and it doesn't seem to have much malt at all to balance things out. Finishes with a lingering hoppy bitter aftertaste. Seems a bit harsh at times, it could use aging or mellowing a bit. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with slightly above average carbonation. Drinkability is average.

S: A decent hoppy smell, but nothing of great significance. Most likely was not dry-hopped, so this might be solely from the hops within the beer.  T: A nice, earthy, hoppy taste that was well-balanced by a malty aftertaste. A very, well-rounded beer.  M: A nice, full-bodied, crisp mouthfeel that was fairly smooth.

Hop Wallop is a slap upside the head DIPA, an incredible beer. Trying this for the first time at the outstanding Pizza Plant on Transit, I was totally impressed with it. It pours a medium amber-golden body, with two finger of white froth capping the 10 oz. glass, while amply lacing the glass as it proceeds. The smell and taste are a full-frontal hopped-up assault on the olfactory, with the taste also bringing subtle but present fruit--some grapefruit, orange, and lemon. The hops coat the tongue afterward, making this a highly drinkable DIPA.  Just dynamite!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,AKBelgianBeast,4.19,Thanks to JCB for this extra.  Pours a clear orange/yellow with good fluffy head. the nose is of english hops with some barnyard funk. Really tastes like english hops in this brew to me. reminds me of meantime but better. Good piney american flavors toward the end though. A good solid IPA and a unique offering from victory. Very drinkable. especially for the 8.5% would never have guessed it was this heavy.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Hoppington,4.39,"Yeah! A fine double IPA offering from Victory. Citrusy yuzu notes with a medium bitter floral. Wayyyy better than HopDevil! Forget HopDevil. This is the the beer you should go for. I wouldn't say this is a hop ""wallop"" per se, but I did feel it on the jaw! Nice, crisp and bitter. Good stuff!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Tdizzle,4.29,"A- Poured into my New Belgium globe glass, this beer pours a clear golden straw color with a slightly off-white head that leaves some thick, sticky lacing.  S- This is a really unique aroma for a DIPA. This beer smells mostly of pine with a very musty and earthy hop bitterness. There are grassy and floral aromas along with faint citrus notes.  T- The intense and earthy hop bitterness dominates but with a slight grainy malt character to back it up. There is a lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue and the alcohol is slighty noticeable. Not much else going on here, but I like it.  M- The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a DIPA, with little carbonation.  D- The ABV is too high to have a few of these in one sitting, but I found this to be light and refreshing for the style.  I really enjoyed this beer. This seems like it could be a great summertime Double IPA because of the grassy aroma and the light mouthfeel. This beer sometimes gets a bad rap for being unbalanced, but I think it's delicious. Highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jamie2dope,3.96,"After a long and dreadful night of work on New Years Eve, I decided to crack open a few of these beers from Victory. Poured in to my Samuel Adams pint glass a somewhat boring clear orange, but the heading is fantastic in that it is white, thick, creamy and holds on to the sides of the glass. Aroma leaves something to be desired, however the fact that mine has been sitting on the back porch all night might have something to do with it. Either way, what I picked up on was a weak citrusy/piney hop smell. Taste is a totally different story in that it has a nice bitter, resiny hoppyness that sort of makes me feel like I am really tasting something that is really meant to resemble hop liquid. The malt is there, but only in the background, as those bitter hops roll around the palate. A middle of the ground beer as far as body, which adds to the drinkability. Alcohol is also a factor that makes it quite drinkable in that it is practically undetectable. Even for a beer this size in ABV, i still might say it would make a good session beer if you spanned it out a bit. As with Hop Devil, Harvest Pilsner, and Prima Pils, Victory shows an almost poetic approach to how they hop this brew. Probably my second favorite from this brewery, with Moonglow Weizenbock coming in at first. Cheers, and Happy New Years.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Stoneman78,4.08,"A- Pours a clear light orange hue, frothy white head that dissipates to a thin layer, sticky lacing S- Dominant pine resin, filled out with earth and grass tones, hints of sweet citrus and toasty malts T- A unique blend of bitter pine resin hops and toasty bread malts, the malt presence is surprising for this genre but not unpleasant, citrus flavors, finishes very bitter and dry M- Medium-bodied, oily texture coats the mouth, mild carbonation D- Smooth DIPA with a surprising amount of malts, it is always an experience to taste East Coast hop beers and I try to rate them separate from West Coast beers, overall this stands up as an interesting malty DIPA with good flavor and balance",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,letsgopens,4.2,"Enjoyed on-tap at Victory Brewing Company, this Double IPA pours a mostly translucent pale sunny gold. The frothy eggshell white head retains pretty well and leaves some sizable walls of lace.  Primarily big hops and citrus in the nose. Sharp and bitter with pine and grapefruit. Juicy sweet and bitter. Slightly yeasty and malty as well. Clean and crisp.  Bright and clean in flavor with lots of bitter/dry hops. Sweet honey and caramel malt provide a nice backbone but definitely plays second fiddle to the sizable hops. Some more fruit comes out in the finish, mostly citrus and a hint of pine. Some dim spice comes through as well.  Bright, effervescent and medium bodied with a semidry finish and lingering hops. All together different but on-par overall with the Hop Devil (that's a compliment). A really underrated brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,seaoflament,3.68,"Pours a golden and copper color with about a half inch of foam.  The initial smell is of citrus peel and pine. Toasted malts and a few bread notes. Not as floral as other hop bombs. Some hints of caramel, orange, mango and apricot make their way as the beer begins to settle. I also get an odd sweet/wet grain aroma which will hurt this one in points.  That odd aroma is also present in the taste, grainy and bitter. Some lemon and orange, toasted malts are also in the flavor.  There are some flavors that seem a bit off, a bit of a mess in my opinion. Still, its easy to finish a 12oz bottle but there are much better DIPAs out there.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,allboutbierge,4.85,"Enjoyed on cask at Fatheads in Pittsburgh.  Lots of lace is left behind as this brew quickly disappears into my belly. Scents are citrus heavy and hit the front of the nose heavily, but not with the brutal smack of many other offerings.  Taste is exceptional. Theres malt there but subdued. Theres much more depth to the hoppy flavors of this offering compared to many other DIPAs.  Cask = natural carbonation & appropriate temperature.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,csmiley,4.14,"A - Poured a cloudy golden yellow with very little head. Lacing was average.  S - The biggest part of the smell was an earthy hop aroma. There might have been some sweeter notes in the background but they were eclipsed by the hops.  T - Hops are #1 in this brew. Seems to stick with an earthy hop in the flavor. Alcohol makes a mark in the flavor as well. There is a hint of sweet malt that balances the overall flavor nicely.  M - This is medium to full bodied with average carbonation. Packs a nice hop ""punch"" and finishes dry.  D - This is a good beer that comes across as pretty smooth considering the style. It deserves a thumbs up from me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,RblWthACoz,3.87,"Pours a clouded gold with little head. Nose is strong with a floral hoppy tone and almost a yeasty presence as well. Flavor is salty. Almost like I am taking a sip of the ocean. Noticable hop presence, but like the nose, it is more of a gentle type of hop. Not the overpowering mouth kicker that so many go for. Feel is low on bubble and carries a decent liquid feel. Drinkable, yes. But I wouldnt consider it a top DIPA. Seem to be better examples out there.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jeffmonarch,4.08,"12 oz. bottle in a snifter.  A - Nice golden amber color with descent white head that stays for a while.  S - Piney hops is the biggest smell but there is also a very cirtusy scent.  T - Great hops flavor, duh. But there is a good citrus flavor to add more character to the beer than just hops.  M - medium bodied with good carbonation.  D - Great beer. If you like ipa's than this a the beer for you.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,pittvkyle7,3.48,"A- Nice clear amber, not much head, little lacing.  S- Smell dominated by piney hops  T- A wallop of hops (as expected) tasted both piney and floral to me. Very nice blend of hops. The malts were understated. This making the beer seem one dimensional to me.  M- Light, with good carbonation  D- High in alcohol, making it not very drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

S: Lots of citrus with a bit of pine mixed in as well.  T: A very good DIPA. Nice blend of citrusy flavors with a solid malt backbone. The piney flavors come through at the end with a very pleasant bitter hoppy finish.  M: Medium bodied, carbonation a little on the low side.  D: A very good DIPA, easy to put down a few of these.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Slynger,4.4,"Pours a clear gold with a slight orange tinge and a creamy white head that disappears slowly leaving some fine-assed lacing around my glass. The nose is nice and big. Piney and citrusy hops. Lemon, grapefruit, and pine needs upfront with an earthy malt backbone. Mmm, tasty, chewy, and solidly full in the mouth. This one tastes of lightly sugared grapefruit and orange backed up by a piney bitterness and slight alcohol warming. The massive hop presence of this one makes it deceptively refreshing and drinkable for its ABV. Very good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,GPHarris,4.35,"thanks to stuartcarter  a - poured a two-fingers thick, white fluffy head into a snifter. this really coated the glass and left nice sheeting and lace throughout. the body was a bright amber color, nice contrast to this brew. s - strong aromas of sticky hops and grapefruit with an underlying malt sweetness that really balances this out well. t - well-balanced again. nice maltiness with hints of citrus and pine. m - very creamy and smooth, this is top notch. d - goes down so easily, really enjoyed this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jdoncbus,4.33,"12 oz. bottle poured into tulip glass. Bright gold appearance with plenty of carbonation. Poured a fluffy, two-finger head that stuck to the glass.  Like the name of the beer, the nose is a tower of sweet hops: orange, lemon, and notes of what can only be described as a sour cream cake-icing type of aroma.  When drank at a cooler temperature (40-45') the beer is more crisp and with an assault of hops which accompanies far more bitterness. When the beer warms it becomes more earthy and presents more toasted malt and softening the hoppy bitterness. Slick mouth feel initially that leaves the staple dryness of a DIPA.  Outstanding beer and a must have for the lover of hops. I am looking forward to sharing these with visiting family tonight & buying a lot more. Nice work Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,bboven,4.32,"Deep gold clear body with a thin but lasting head and lots of lacing.  Big piney hop aroma that hides the alcohol well. Pinch of malt, but this one is all about the hops.  Big complex hops in the front, even some sweetness. Turns ridiculously bitter really quickly, though. Great stuff.  Slick mouthfeel, highly carbonated. A little sticky at the end, but then, there are a lot of hop oils in here.  Great beer. I hope this kind of stuff doesn't disappear over the next couple of years with the shortage and all.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,drseamus,3.82,"Crystal clear light amber body. It is topped with a nice white head with tons of visible carbonation. The aroma is filled with a bunch of grapefruit; just like I like it. It is also nice and crisp. The flavor is a wallop all right. Nice bitterness up front fading into a bitter grapefruit with some hints of pine. It's a great taste but ultimately lacking any malt profile. I would have liked some caramel or any malt really. Decently heavy body but great for what it is. The bitterness is a bit much to drink a bunch, but it's good for a glass.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Tolann,4.27,"A - Lighter in color and a small dense head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Color is not quite copper, but definitely not blond. Somewhat amber in color  S - Hops, hops, and more hops. Kinda piny. A little citrus sweet with maybe grapefruit. Mostly tho piny and grassy hops and a lot of them!  T - Wow great hop taste! Not harsh, but BIG. Grassy hops and sweetness. This is yummy! Little bit of orange and grapefruit citrus taste, maybe a little bit of lemon, but lots and lots of hops! Its a good balance and very enjoyable.  M - Drinks smooth, isn't too fizzy, and the hops lay on your pallet after every sip. It's awesome.  D - For the amount of hops, I find this very easy drinking. This would be a good session beer if it hadn't cost me over $10 for a 6pack!

345,14916,rxdrewthejew,3.8,"Don't get too many easy coast crafts out here, so when I saw this had to get it. Let's see how it compares to my beloved west coast DIPA's.  A: Hazy yellow with some orange streaks. Pretty typical color, maybe ligher than I'm used to. Lots of sediment but probably my fault from the pour. Not much head at all here.  S: Very bitter scent, lots of hops, smells a bit like really hoppy iced tea. Seems mostly pine, but I can detect some citrus. Or not. I have a cold, at any rate.  T: Really interesting flavor. Very very bitter obviously, but a big sweet base surrounds it. Seems like sweet citrus or maybe passion fruit. Not really malty sweet. Finishes with a big hop blast, but the hop flavor gets a bit drowned out by the sweetness.  MF: Very smooth and syrupy. Much less carbonated than other DIPAs I've had. Alcohol is very masked.  D: Mixed feelings about this one. The flavor is good overall, but I don't like the fact that the sweetness masks the hop character. Just kinda ruins it a bit for me. But that being said, this is very hoppy and very good. For me, with DIPAs, I like a little less balance than this has.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,redmagik99,2.41,"OK i dont know if this is a bad bottle or what but this beer has gone horribly awry. DIPAs are normally my favorite style but this beer just doesnt make sense to me. i knew immediately from the smell that it was gonna be funky. its not oxidation. its kind of like some weird hard candy. Or the taste of advil when u let it stay in your mouth too long? Definite medicinal qualities. The alcohol is not hidden at all. The taste is just alcohol and some hops with cough medicine. Its bitter as fuck and not in a good way. im not gonna denounce victory because i know first hand that they are a more than respectable brewing company, and it may just be that i got a bad bottle, but this hop wallop was just not up to par.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,dbatch,3.43,"2007 edition, twelve ounce bottle poured into a snifter.  A: Pours a fine copper color, very clear, with a good white head, not a ton, and the head is a fine.  S: Strong malt aroma up front, but balanced by the hops. The hops show a nice blend of pine and citrus aromas. A bit soapy as well. Not overwhelming, but the hops let you know they are there.  T: It bites you right up front with the hops, very strong citrus flavor, grapefruit especially, followed by a soapy flavor that leads you to a pretty strong alcohol taste. This beer shows you its good side up front, and gives you a kick in the mouth as it finishes.  M: Strong bite at first taste, very carbonated, leaves very dry like many DIPA's. Also leaves a bit of a soapy aftertaste.  D: I gotta say I'm one and done with this one in one sitting. Its good, but I think earlier editions of this beer were better.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,TheTrevor,3.24,"This beer poured a dark straw color with a two and a half-finger fluffy head. The smell reminds me of citrus and maybe even a little pineapple. The taste begins hard with some very piney tasting hops that give away to a little bit of lemony citrus and a rather strong hop bite that doesn't linger in the mouth. The beer has a lot of presence and I couldn't imagine drinking more than one bottle at a time, but it's definitely something worth trying for the hops lovers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,MrHungryMonkey,4.32,"Strong citric hops float happily into my nose. Deeper I discover some flower and a little pine. Minimal malt aromas  whoeee! Not balanced I guess, but I like it.  Medium straw / pale gold with good clarity and a head to die for  creamy and large and off-white and large  looks kind of like meringue. I wish meringue smelled like this though.  Rich dense roasted malty malt in all its thick viscosity hits me first. Then the flavor spout give way to hops with unexpectedly equal magnitudes of bitterness and flavor. The flavor is centered around flowers, plants, and perfume/herbs. So nice. The bitterness comes and goes, but at its peak its almost, not quite, numbing. So nice. All the meanwhile I still have all that thick malt, a good deal of sickly sticky sweetness, and a nice little soft carbonation. Finishes dry with plenty of hop bitterness.  Ah yes, this is a beer. Thank you Victory. This brews head is still there and its left nasty trails all over the glass. How nice; and how rare to have a beer whose head stays for the entirety of the consumption process. Also, and maybe more impressively, what a wonderful balance Hop Wallop exhibits  the hop and malt flavor magnitudes are huge and wonderful each, yet they remain in a grand harmony. Yes, how rare indeed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Persistent small carbonation bubbles rising to the top. It looks amazing IMO. S: Very rich, hoppy with background malt, also a piney smell that I associate with Christmas trees and always makes me skeptical of beers, but in this case not strong enough to bother me T: A very forward hop taste, but not as bitter as expected and finishes with piney/grapefruity taste. M: Very smooth and highly carbonated, finishes with a dry, grapefruit taste (and some hops naturally). A little to harsh in the finish to be rated higher D: I really like this, more so than Hop Devil, disagreeing with most of my friends.

Very hoppy with slight citrus notes but dominated by a unique spiciness which only after tasting did I realize resembled a pine flavor. Feels full and smooth on the mouth. The taste sets in late but kicks you with a STRONG hop flavor that is very bitter, yet still smooth.

Smooth except for the hop bite. Not surprisingly, hops dominate the lasting finish as well.  D: You must get this while it's fresh. I consumed an old one a while back & couldn't finish it.

The color is an amber jewel tone, with a few lazy upward-moving bubbles.  Aroma is heavenly...fruity and juicy like Amarillo, clean and grassy like Saaz. The aroma doesn't hang around long enough, but that initial blast is really something. Malt is in there too to back it up.  Light mouthfeel, but bigger than your average IPA or pale ale. Mild astringency/bitterness at first, pink grapefruit pith, descending into more pale malt flavors, before a bracing finish. Very long, and bitter end. Reminds me of the aftertaste after tasting a fresh hop cone, that bitterness that just never fades. Light suggestion of honey a few minutes after the swallow, once the bitterness subsides.

The color is a light orange with some bubbles after a hard pour in a pint glass. No real head is formed and just a hint of foam remains for the tasting. The scent is so faint that I wondered if the beer was bad. Hardly any scent of hops that I have smelled in other hoppy beers. With first taste, I find the beer is very bitter. After making sure the mouthfull touches my whole mouth, I get a faint citrus/herbal taste. But before I can identify the flavors, an incredible aftertaste comes from the back of my mouth and seems to reach to my throat. An almost medicine taste that makes me forget about the first sensations. It coats my mouth and seems to want to not want to go away. I take some time for the taste to leave. I take another taste. and another. With each one the bitterness seems to deminish a bit each time but just a little of the medicine flavor of an aftertaste remains on the very back of my tongue. I have tried most of the Victory's beers and I think I will have to stick to their other fine creations.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,kosmoraios,3.87,"Pours a very clear, light golden color. Looks almost like a lager. Head is white, 1/4 finger, but leaves good lacing and never quite dissipates.  Aroma is of sweet citrus with a hint of pine sap. Taste is indescribably ""light"" for what it is, with the orange/grapefruit/pine sap dominating the sweet malt backing. As the ale warms, the peppery-sweetness of the malt becomes more evident. I'm totally baffled as to what type of malt it is.  Mouthfeel is light and carbonated, with no hint of the oily phenols that I expect in a double IPA. Very drinkable, even sessionable, if one disregards the 8.5% ABV :)  I must say that I really like Victory. This one is different... sweeter and ""lighter"", if you will, then a DIPA. I can't quite decide whether I love it or dislike it. I'll have to try it again in a few weeks.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,OWSLEY069,4.2,"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a malty grapefruity/ citrus hop presence. In the taste, a huge grapefruity hop profile, with a nice peppery malt backing. A malty/ bigger body mouthfeel, with a grapefruity hop and dry malt aftertaste. Nice big hops, balanced well with a big malt presence.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Lothore,3.93,"A- Pours a golden orange hue with a small but sticky white head which leaves a little bit of lacing. Very few carbonation bubbles are present.  S- Smell is very sweet and malty with hints of piney hops in the background. This reminds me of Titan DIPA which I wasn't a fan of.  T- Taste is very hop forward, with a candy sweet maltiness hiding in the background. The finish is fairly dry and bitter.  M- Very carbonated and a lot thinner than I was expecting from the nose.  D- This beer attempts to be a very hop forward DIPA and certainly suceeds at that. What keeps it from being up there with Pliny, Dreadnaught, Double simcoe etc. is the fact that it just doesn't balance enough. Very close to being a great DIPA with a few minor setbacks.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,sopclod,4.25,"Is that one of the seven dwarves on the bottle? Drinky? Hoppy? No, it's Horace ""Hop"" Wallop, and he has a story to tell!  In general I like Victory brews, and I like hops, so when I saw Hop Wallop at my local Binny's, I jumped at the chance. I picked up a 6 pack for a very reasonable price.  This beer sits somewhere between IPA and DIPA; it's definitely ""bigger"", if you will, than your sierra nevada pale ale and such, but it's not in the same category as say, Maharaja or 120 minute.  I don't know what this beer looks like since I poured it directly from the bottle to my mouth. This beer is all hops. There's a lot of citrus, with the more earthy, bitter flavors in the background a bit. The alcohol is very well masked.  Overall a top notch IPA, especially considering the price.  EDIT: I should mention that the bottles I had had no date on them. I know some people have had issues with old beer, but I don't know when mine were brewed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,brantadid,2.66,"Poured a clear golden color with a thin white head. No lacing.  Smelled like a mass produced beer. Faint hops. Not very pungent at all.  Taste is totally different than the smell. Tons of bitter hops. Slight sweetness on the front palate followed by bitter citrus rind, and even more bitterness on the back palate. Tasted a little unbalanced.  High carbonation with a creamy mouthfeel.  I really like Victory but I wasn't impressed with this offering.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Jmamay22,4.37,"I picked up a single bottle because I have too many hop bombs on hand. First time enjoying this one despite living fairly close to the brewery. Maybe I'll search out for more if this turns out as great as advertised.  Pours out a clear gold with a hint of amber. The beer is only a few shades darker than a pils and features a somewhat unique color, that seems somewhat bland in my opinion. The head is about one finger deep with an ecru coloring. Very little amount of carbonation rises slowly to the top.  Smells of piney citric hops. All grape fruit and pine needles here. Maybe some hints of caramel to balance things out a bit. Solid, but I've sniffed better.  In a word, nice. Taste is the best feature of this beer aside from drinkability. Grape fruit and resinous hops are all there with a sweet malt background that keeps things together. All hops, but not in a disdainfully bitter sense. Well down Double IPA.  Mouthfeel is dead center medium with prickly carbonation that enhances the hop flavors. Drinkability is way to easy and this brew is dangerously deceiving. A great hop head dream that grew on me until the glass emptied.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ajr24,4.7,"The brewers of victory really know what they're doing here. This imperial IPA satisfies everything I look for in an exceptional beer.  Love the bottle design and the story of Horace ""Hop"" Wallop on the side, even though it hurt my eyes big time to read it... Pours an ambery, goldenish copper with awesome off-white head with tons of lacing.  The smell is Hoptacular hoppiness (so is the taste), piny and citrusy.  It's true that hoppiness is happiness, tasted hops intertwined with grapefruit and other citrus flavors.  The mouthfeel is pure bliss- ""it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited!""  For an imperial IPA I could sure session this beer if I wanted to- tis a crying shame this beer is seasonal.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,kwakwhore,4.35,"I've reviewed this beer before, but the newest version(drink by Nov. 08) is just out and it deserves updating. Hops are still what this beer is about, floral citrus in the aroma which dominates everything else. The flavor is hoppy as well. The first thing on the tongue is bitter grapefruit, which is followed with just enough malt undertone to provide some balance. The finish is like the start, dominated by bittering hops. If you don't like hops you won't like this beer, but for me the longer I drink beer, the more I like hops, so this beer has grown on me in a big way. I do think that this is one of the better releases of this beer, one more example of a high quality beer by a high quality brewer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Kegatron,4.1,"On cask at the VBC.  Pours a cloudy, golden caramel color with a big creamy, vanilla white head that left some excellent lacing down the glass. Aroma is prominent floral hops and citrus with a slight undertone of sweetness and heat.  Taste is a bitter hop bomb throughout highlighted by a very strong floral citrus character. Underlying sweet maltiness is present but gets overpowered way too easily and seems to be there just for the hops to ride along on. Bitterness and alcohol just coats your palette in the finish, in an ending that you wont soon forget until the next sip. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, silky smooth, and delicous.  Wow, this was my first experience with this beer on cask and it was quite a memorable one. Not for the hoppy faint of hearted but ectasy for serious hop heads. Unfortunately that combo of hops and alcohol make it a serious sipper and I seriously doubt that I could (or would) want more than one in a sitting, so it takes a hit in the drinkability department. If your able to find this guy on cask outside of the brewery, do yourself a favor, batten down the hatches, and set sail for one hoppy ride.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Traquairlover,2.71,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  A = Slightly murky orange-ish amber. Forms a head of medium to small bubbles which dissipates pretty quickly leaving good lacing on the glass and a nice film on the surface. Light amount of carbonation bubbles of medium size. Would grade it higher if not for the hazy clarity.  S = Strong alcohol presence with an almost anti-septic smell, once you get past that it has pine with hints of citrus, not a lot of malt.  T = Lots of hops taste, mostly pine but also some lemon, maybe even a hint of lime and flowers. Lots of bitterness throughout the drink and with a long dry, bitter finish. The alcohol kick is a little too much. If you like straight bitter hops, this definitely does fits the bill. There is not nearly enough balance though, I barely even detect malt flavors. Final view is it is unbalanced and the alcohol was almost antiseptic.  M = Medium bodied, great amount of carbonation giving it a frothy silky mouthfeel. Good mouthcoating.  D = This beer is good but has limited appeal for serious hopheads who can also accept the high ABV.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,MiguelMandingo,4,"I meant to review this brew last season, and I ended up just drinking my last bottle and couldn't review it. I have had to wait about seven months for this to be released again. It was worth the wait - I really enjoy this beer. It isn't the best DIPA out there, but it is pretty tasty.  Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a DFH snifter.  Appearance - It is a light honey gold color. Pours completely transparent. It produces a 1 finger head that slowly dissipates to a paper-thin crown. It leaves behind a decent amount of lacing.  Smell - The scent is primarily hops. There is a lot of pine, citrus grapefruit, pineapple, honey and caramel scents. The honey and caramel smells are very subdued. The scent is very floral in nature.  Taste - Hops, and not much else. I get flavors of pine, grapefruit, and lemon zest. There is a slight hint of caramel malt, but you have to dig deep for it. It is definitely a bitter hop bomb. It tastes really good, but this is far from balanced. It lives up to its namesake, to be sure.  Mouthfeel - This is medium bodied, but on the lighter side of medium. The carbonation level helps to cut through the bitterness. It has a slightly dry finish.  Drinkability - Good. This is a pretty easy drinking DIPA. The bitterness keeps making me go back to take another sip, and it pairs excellently with a spicey meal. I have had two this evening, and that is my limit.  This is one of my favorite offerings from Victory. Tasty stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,uberkane,4.2,"This is my first review!! How exiting. I've been into craft beer for over a year now, so I believe it is time! Why not start with a wallop??  Appearance: Comes in a brown, 12 oz. bottle. According to the bottle it is a ""Very Hoppy Ale"" and clocks in at 8.5% ABV. There is a comical picture of an old man prospector, foaming at the mouth and seeming quite happy. A story accompanies this man, whose name is Horace ""Hop"" Wallop. A heartwarming tale of a prospector down on his luck, who gets out of the gutter when he discovers this hoppy brew.  Beer pours a light golden yellow with a hint of orange. There is a small white head, but this is from a pour on the gentle side. The head dissipates, and leaves a small faint, bubbly ring of lacing.  Smell: Hops! Piney and citrus hops. Sweet and sticky, yet spicy. Grapefruit. After agitation, there are some soft breadey notes from the malts. What a smell!  Taste: Grapefruit and piney hops immediately upon hitting mouth. Spicy and herbal as well. Malt enters the scene while swallowing, felt on the back of the palate. A soft bready, cereal note balances your ballet a little, but Hops is the predominate flavor. It persists in the after taste, leaving a leafy taste, with some grapefruit and herbalness. Not sure when (or if!?) the aftertaste goes away. A constant reminder ""Hey! You're drinking a beer! And don't you forget it!"" As the beer warms, the malt backbone becomes more present, and the hops a bit spicier.  Mouthfeel: Light body, but has some smooth creaminess to it. Carbonation is present, but not dominating.  Drinkability: Surprisingly very drinkable, considering the hops and an above average ABV (not for an IIPA, just in general). Not sure about this being a session beer for me. I'd probably only have one or two at a time. However, that depends on my mood. If i get into hoppy moods, i could definitely see this as a session beer, kinda like when i get into spicy moods and eat non-stop spicy foods for a week.  The main thing here is, as it suggests, Hops. So in that regard, it does well. You get exactly what you see, and if you're a hophead, or just looking for a hop fix, it's great!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,PhageLab,4.05,"Single bottle poured into a standard pint glass.  A - Bronze mixture with orange highlights and a good inch of froth that hung out for a while. Laced very well, impressive presentation.  S - Aroma here of course is big on hop tinge, but there is a bit of balance displayed with the citrus, lemons and grapefruit, and even some pine. Makes the mouth water.  T - Mild bitterness, slight sweetness from the citrus notes, but, most noteably, huge pine hop blast. Almost minty in a way, but together it tastes great and masks the abv completely.  M - Medium to full bodied, great carbonation level, left a piney residue in the mouth that made me want another sip.  D - Pretty good, this was a godsend after trying Stoudt's double. Single-handedly renewed my faith in double IPA's. I'd take another any day, recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Taste mimmicks the smell with a hint of vanilla but on the finish is definitely overpowered by the bitter hop finish mixing with the small malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is average to medium, leaves a nice coating on the palate and lips. For me the drinkability is exceptional for the style ,DIPA. Most DIPA's i've had lately are pretty heavy handed by the citrus bitterness but this one is pretty well balanced. Again, for the style i feel this could be sessionable, but , proceed with caution! One or the top 2 of this style to date for me, will be heading out for more soon. YUM!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

The flavor is more complex....again more grapefruit-pine....last years tasted more like a Saaz to me. It's just as bitter as before , but there is more of a sweet malt backdrop....not too much though. Alcohol is more evident in this version and compliments the hop ""wallop"". Pretty drinkable even @ 8.5%...I'm looking for more than one with this. Very good.

345,14916,pwoods,4.14,"Thanks a ton to NJpadreFan for this bottle. Been looking forward to this.  12oz. brown bottle poured into a pint. No dating but it was released within a week.  A: Pours a very, very pale orange. Completely transparent. 1 finger pearl white rocky head that remains a thick skim on the brew. 1 ring of fluffy lacing at the top and a pebble here and there on the way down.  S: Pretty straight forward. Pine-y and citrus hops. A mixture of grapefruit with a tiny zap of lemon. Just a hint of some phenols as it warms a tad.  T/M: Ah, very nice. Not overly bitter but a nice strong wallop, har har. Very citrus-y and tangy. The hops hold strong all the way through to the dry finish and then last and last. Malts show up a little more as the brew warms but hops are definitely the highlight. The body is pretty thin, inviting me back before I know it.

Smell: Hops are strong and piney. Nicely blended with a sweet citrus scent (grapefruit and maybe some mango). Pretty straight forward.  Taste: Clearly hops are the dominant feature here. They are piney and very bitter. A solid plus for this beer. Some secondary citrus flavors add a sweet factor and a little more bitterness. A hint of malt is noticeable, but it's far from balanced.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It leans medium bodied. Carbonation is excellent. At 8.5%, it's a strong beer. But, very smooth drinkable for an IPA of its stature. I'd probably limit myself due to its strength. Overall, it's a very good brew and highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,John_M,3.98,"Nice to see the new Hop Wallop out. Had this on tap at both Mahaffey's and Max's this past weekend.  The beer pours a solid orange copper color, with an enticing creamy white head. The beer has very good head retention and lacing.  The nose on this beer is not very complex, but has what you would expect; quite a bit of soft, citrusy grapefruit. The beer is just lovely on the palate, with the flavors replicating the nose. The beer has some very nice bitterness, but is quite well balanced, with an impressive soft, light mouthfeel. The malt is not overdone on this DIPA, and it finishes fairly dry. The only thing that mars this beauty is a somewhat hard finish, which detracts from its drinkability IMO. I'm thinking that the cask version of this beer might have a better finish, making it more drinkable, but will have to wait for the opportunity.  This is a very well made DIPA, with an abv. that is well disguised. Can't wait to try the cask version!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

T: Grapefruit hits you immediately, you can feel the malts more than taste them but keeps the hops very balanced. I am surprised the alcohol is so nicely woven into the flavor.  M: There is a hoppy stickiness but there is a sweetness that keeps the tartness from overpowering. The carbination is on target. Not much alcohol feel for the strength.

Cool label with a cute story about Horace ""hop"" Wallop and his invention of the beer that now beers his name. Medium pour into a stubby tulip glass, about two fingers of head that leaves some lacing, beer is a rich amber color, nice but perhaps a bit dark, but then that might be from the width of my glass.  The smell is mostly hops with some caramel malt in there too. It is very enjoyable, the hops don't overpower and the sweetness just peaks through. The taste is similar, a nice sweet hoppy brew. Mouthfeel is good, goes down smooth--not too watery, overcarbonated or syrupy--a good balance here.

Aroma alludes to its age: lots of citrusy hops, but it's equally balanced with some nice esters and crystal malts. On the tongue it is also quite balanced. While hops remain the dominant feature, a really rounded malt bill keeps it interesting. Alcohol warming in the finish, and dry but with some sweetness to keep it drinkable. All around a solid DIPA, but the dynamic of the hop flavor and aroma was certainly lacking.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,CortexBomb,3.68,"Pour is golden with a slight head on top. Though the head left town, generous lacing was left behind. The nose, as expected, pure hops, tending toward the citrus end of the spectrum.  The flavour on this is along the same lines, a huge hop profile with both citrus and pine notes present, though not completely out of control either, as the malts rein it in a bit. A bitey, sweet finish.  The mouth is fairly thick, which I like for the style. Drinkability is about dead-on average, few DIPA beers are quaffers, and this isn't one of the few. Not difficult to drink though by any means.  The bottom line: A tasty take on the DIPA style by the folks at Victory.

Could bathe in this one.  T- Amazing dry, citrus hops tingles my mouth. It's like munching on a handful of piney/citrus hops. A hophead's dream. Awesome.  M- Pretty carbonated and very dry from the hops. Nice tingling effect.  D- The bottle state's ""Hoppiness is Happiness"". How true.

Subtle aroma of stone fruit  Taste: BITTER, this truly is a wallop of hops, a little bit more mild than bottles ive had that were fresher but still real strong.

Soap, orange, cherry, pine sap and some mint in the nose.  As I take my first sip I notice the smooth malt flavors immediately-toffee and light caramel malt. These flavors quickly take a back seat to the fruity and then the coniferous flavors that soon dominate. I can pick out some strawberry, orange, grapefruit rind, and pineapple. Big pine in the finish. Some copper flavors in the finish as well. Very aggressive bitterness, think Stone IPAs.  Very well executed DIPA.

345,14916,SPLITGRIN,4.1,"Pours with almost a layered look untill it settles into a two finger light tan head that sits on top of a straw colored body. Leaves a slight scatty lace on the glass. Fragrent zesty hop character on the nose includes grassey sweet citrus notes. Sharp bitter bite attacks the tongue as soon as it hits the mouth. Mellows a bit on the palate and turns almost syrupy long with a hint of sweetness. Bitter comes back to highlight the mouthfeel, but not harsh. Welcomed hop-head style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ButchAleman,3.8,"Had it for the first time in years and it was a little different than I remembered but still a good beer. The beer seemed more malty than hoppy. The first time I tried it, nearly three years ago, all I remembered was the hops. I don't know what changed me or the beer. I still enjoyed it and would drink it again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Monkeyknife,4.15,"Poured from a bottle slightly hazy yellow with a two finger white head and some sticky lacing.  Beautiful aroma of citrusy hops, especially grapefruit and lemon.  A buttload of hoppy goodness with grapefruit, floral notes and some pine. There is also the presence of malt in the mix and some lingering bitterness is noted at the end.  Medium bodied with a nice zing of carbonation to it.  This is a very nice DIPA. Not really sessionable IMO but not many DIPAs are.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,soupyman10,4.11,"Golden color with a fairly small head that leaves surprisingly solid lacing. Nose is fairly mild, some light fruity hops and a touch of caramel malt. Flavor is a little bit more impressive: crazy hops. They're straight bitter, drying and floral. The light sweet malt of the nose shows up again, but again it's very mild in the face of the extremely hoppy flavor. Strong and lingering aftertaste. Body is medium and perfectly carbonated. Overally, this is a very good beer, and although it's extremely bitter, it doesn't really seem too much more hoppy than the Hop Devil. Probably a good introduction to DIPAs.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,aforbes10,4.47,"Single bottle...dont remember where i picked it up. Pours with a tightly packed head on an orange bosy with lots of little bits of sediment floating around (always a good thing in a big IPA, imo). Grasyy, citrusy hop odor. Very grape-fruit like. Reminds me of hopslam/dreadnaught. Taste is mmmm-mmm good. bitter, grapefruity hops surrounding a sticky sweet malt body. waming alcohol. Citrus smack sticks around in my mouth for an age. delicious. extremely smooth. a thick IPA, but as big as it is, its a good one and very drinkable. I'm almost ashamed that i haven't had this before, having lived in PA for so long (albeit when i was still underage).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Duster72,4.1,"Pours a murky golden color with a half finger white head that has good retention. Aroma is pleasant citrusy hops and sweet malts.

Very drinkable DIPA and one I would buy regularly if available in my area.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,macster,4.02,"Hop Wallop indeed. Like having a bale of hops dumped in your face! If youre not a big hop head this is treacherous territory to be explorin.  Pours a slightly hazy deep gold color with a 1/2"" white head. Nice retention and thick lacing throughout the glass.  The aroma is simply just an onslaught of hops. Lay one grapefruit and one orange and crush both over a bed of warm sun-drenched pine needles and take a big whiff. There ya have it.  Mouthfeel medium bodied, smooth and creamy with a laid back carbonation.  Taste is surprisingly farily well balanced here. Of course the hops prevail with tons of citrus and pine, but backed admirably by a welcome intrusion of light caramel and some malty toffee notes. Finish quickly reverts back to a LOOOONG hoppy firm bitterness.  Had 3 of these one night on a recent visit to NJ and by the 3rd the hops got to be a bit overwhelming, but the first 1 or 2 are a delicious treat for sure!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,blakesell,4.18,"Poured from the bottle into a pilsner style glass.  Appearance- Clear straw golden with tiny rising bubbles of carbonation. Huge frothy head that takes forever to dissapate. Major lacing leftover on the glass. Eventually dissapates into a rocky head about 10 minutes later.  Smell- There are some major spicy hops in this baby. It's like sniffing a hop cone. My fears were that it would be identical to the HopDevil, but my fears were unnecessary.  Taste- Malt upfront with the hops coming in well after the swallow. It is a hop wallop, but not near as overpowering as I was expecting from the smell. A pretty smooth double IPA and I wish I had sampled it earlier in the season.  Mouthfeel- Smooth and refreshing. Exactly what is needed on this 97 degree day. The hops are strong, but the alcohol isn't too warming for it to be a good warm weather drinker.  Drinkability- Pretty great. I could go to town on these babies. I suppose the 8.5% could catch up after time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

S: Hops, hops, hops, full of pine and citrus, very fragrant.  T: Very hoppy, as in the name, pine is the dominant flavor here, with some citrus backing it up, there is some malty, biscuity flavor in this beer as well, but it is not as abundant, this thing is a true hop bomb.  M: Smooth, creamy, and crisp, a bit warming from the alcohol presence, but this is hidden well.  D: Another great Double IPA to drink, this one is kind of hard to find for me, but very enjoyable when I can, I also love the label, very entertaining.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Lacing is moderate and clingy at times.  S - Scent is much like grapefruit bubblegum, if there is such a thing. Okay, maybe not exactly but both flavors are plainly evident amongst the hoppy flavors. Slight hint of a grainy malt bill. Smell becomes more grainy and less hoppy as it warms.  T - Starts slightly sweet and crisp then immediately jumps to the bitterness. Hops are not overly fruity yet exhibit a good deal of piney taste. Nice flavor, but not impressive.  M - Crisp and dry and bitter with a very dry aftertaste. Sounds like a DIPA to me.  D - Alcohol at 8.5% is slightly evident in reaction, but thankfully not so much in the taste.

345,14916,FenwaySquid,4.12,"Presentation: 12 oz brown bottle, BBD of 10/25/2007 printed on the label, poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours a hazy/cloudy light gold color, completely opaque. The Head formed about 1-2 fingers thick and faded quickly into a thin layer, along with some lacing that stuck to the sides of the glass.  Aroma: Citrus and pine hops, quite strong, almost overpowering.  Taste: Wow is this stuff good. The hop bitterness never lets anything from the malts come through at all. Piney at first, more citrus towards the end. The finish, predictably, is bitter and hoppy, and lingers for quite a while.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth for such a strong beer, medium body. The carbonation was in good balance as well.  Overall: An excellent version of the American Double IPA, very little hint of the high alcohol percentage. If you, like Hop Wallop, think that hoppiness is happiness, grab one of these as quickly as possible.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,tpd975,4.13,"This beer arrived in a trade with BeerTruth, Thanks.  A: Nice honey yellow color with a billowing head at the pour. The head fades to a nice ring circling the brew as it is continually fed by a steady rush of bubbles to the top. Sticky lacing is left behind as the contents disappear. A nice looking DIPA.  S: Has a nice citrus aroma to it. I smell grapefruit mainly, not much else. Pretty mild compared to other reviews.  T: A nice DIPA. Starts off pretty mild with a light sweetness about it. Then you are hit with the punch of hops. Sharp, acidic hops, a nice taste that is different from any other DIPA I have tried before.  M: This one is pretty full bodied. It has a syrupy quality to it.  D: Very drinkable for a DIPA. There is no hint of the high ABV and it goes down smooth and refreshing.  Overall: A good DIPA. This is the first beer I have ever enjoyed from Victory and would like to try some more. Not sure if this one is fresh or not, I have the feeling its not. The aroma is mild and I think the hoppiness may have been muted in this one due to age. I think it tastes a little milder than a fresh one would, but its a great tasting DIPA nonetheless. I finished off the bottle rather quickly and wish I had another one to follow. I will seek out another in the future to see how this one compares to one fresh from the brewery.  The bottle notes hoppiness is happiness... I have to agree!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,CarolinaCardinals,4.42,Received in late May as part of the May MicroBeerClub shipment.  Beer poured a golden orange with a nice fluffy white head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is dominated by strong citrusy hops but is also heavy on malts. Taste is a nice blend of malts and citrusy hops. It seems that the malts are starting to come out more as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied than most DIPA's but is very smooth. Drinkability is very good. The abv is well hidden in this lighter easy to sip brew.

An incredible citrus and hop scent.  A taste--strong citrus...grapefruit..loads of perfect bitterness from the hops...then a smile. This one is really good.  A great aroma and taste along with a solid feel. Very nice kick at the swallow.  Definitely one of the better beers I've had. Enjoyed the hop devil, and others, from Victory, but this one is choice.

A. Gorgeous dark amber with a 1 finger head that leaves wonderful lacing.  S. Pine? Citrus? This is a very complicated brew.  T. Wow! I like that the hops are well balanced with the malt. The hops are definitely dominant but when they start to overwhelm the malt evens it out.  M. Again great. The carbonation is mild. The higher abv is well hidden.  D. I could have many of these. However, the 8.5% abv would make it hard to function!  Again, a great product from Victory.

Lacing coats the glass all the way to the bottom.  It has a nice aroma full of citrus hops with some pine notes. The nose isn't quite as strong as I'd expect.  Taste is very hoppy as expected. There is a definite citrus character. It seems like there is much more going on with the hops than this alone but it seems a bit muddled to me. The flavor is much more balanced than I expected. The hops are definitely in the forefront but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is full and creamy. The alcohol is noticeable yet pleasent.  I have to say that this is a solid offering. I could not see drinking this all of the time, but it is a nice ""sipper.""

A subsequent pour on a later date results in a cloudy gold. Aroma is not as strong as I was expecting, but pleasant. First taste is very full and makes an immediate impact on my palate. Lots of grapefruity hops. However, I'm not a massive fan of the grapefruity variety - I'm more a floral hop type myself. This one almost feels like sucking on a grapefruit.

I did think it's that my pallet has become more accustomed to the West Coast hop bombs, but some Midwest IPAs (Furious and 2 Hearted, most notably) have blown me away. It looks good. The smell is not as sweet or fragrant as a DIPA should be. Same could be said of the taste. A certain alcohol tinge lets you know you're drinking something with a slightly higher ABV.  It's not that there's really anything wrong with this beer, but it just doesn't take it to the upper hop echelon.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

The aroma is quite hoppy, but it has some grassy notes rising over the typical IPA hop aromas of citrus and pine. The flavor is of lightly toasted malts with some fruitiness followed by a long bitterness in the finish. The 8.5 % ABV is well hidden. Not bad, but I was expecting a little more from a beer that costs 10 bucks a six.

345,14916,Contra,4.17,"Hop Wallop, seems to me, to be a lighter-bodied, but full flavored Double IPA. It pours a light, hazy gold hue with lacy head. Nice, but nothing outstanding as far as appearance is concerned. The aroma has a floral bouquet, not too strong, but it is there. The taste is where this beer shines - slightly tame at first, followed by the ""wallop"". Crisp bitterness, and all hops. Compared to other Double IPAs, I've found this is a lot easier on the palate, and therefore more ""drinkable"" than average. But I also enjoy the heavy, creaminess of Double Simcoe & Hercules. This really just comes down to personal preference.  Overall, Hop Wallop seems to be a nice balance between flavor and drinkability. An excellent choice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,EVLguy,3.82,"2007 Hop Wallop poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Cloudy after the pour but began to clear up after about 20 minutes. Deep gold in color.  Smell: Light grass, herb, and hay[very interesting] aromas. Very pleasant, but deceiving when the intense flavor of this beer is considered.  Taste: This beer must be nothing but hops. All got from it was citrusy hops, pine tar like flavors and some more grassy spices at the finish. An easy winner for hopheads.  Mouthfeel: The lack of malt did leave this beer a bit too dry and light for my personal tastes. Still that's not too hard to get past after enjoying the flavors from the first few sips.  Drinkibilty: Not meant to be had one after the other unless you are a hophead supreme.  This is the best example I've ever come across of a beer only released once a year that definitely should only be released once a year.

The taste was definitely pine upfront followed by a nice malt/sweet flavor. In the mouth it felt slightly thick, not in a bad way, and full bodied.

345,14916,khiasmus,4.03,"Poured a bit too cold, had to let this one warm while I enjoyed the forum a bit...  A- Golden, slightly hazy, had a finger of head when I poured it, which has now been long gone. There's a tad of lacing where it was, as a tribute to its memory...  S- Grass and grapefruit, with caramel balancing a bit... and oddly, an almost witbier tinge, faint back there... What kind of yeast is in this? Smells good, though. The yeast does not overpower, it's mostly the dense piney hops, a slight metallic tinge, and just a hint of alcohol.  T- Initially caramel-malty, but not overtly so. Retains the metallic hint I got in the nose, and the hops come in quite strongly as it begins to go down. Aftertaste is grapefruit acid and a hint of grass. Quite pleasant, though not as intense as many a double IPA. Not deserving of the name, I didn't think.  M- Excellent mouthfeel. Smooth and full-bodied, but with high carbonation. The finish is smooth in the middle and astringent on the sides, if you know what I mean. The body is quite balanced with the amount of carbonation, and the lingering dryness and hint of warming do what they're supposed to... make you want another sip.  D- Simply a tad bit too grassy and grapefruity in the finish for the really high score it almost merited. Even though i love hops, the finishing flavor is not one that makes you want several of these. A great beer, But as double IPA's go, there are several better. I recommend you try it, though... it's one I'll pick up from time to time, to be sure.  Had again on tap 12/10/2008. Raised the drinkability score. This beer is not overly complex, has a lot of hop flavor but surprisingly little hop bitterness. However, the drinkability for ABV is ridiculous.

I initially mistakenly thought I smelled a sulfury, lager-like scent... but after smelling a bit longer, I realized that it was a heavy floral scent with a little citrus in the background.  The taste was all-about bitterness. It is strong enough to drown out most of the other flavors. It is a strong, probably noble hop bitterness. There is also a crisp, bready malt flavor.  The mouthfeel is full with a medium, and highly carbonated finish. The drinkability is very good.

Up front, I mostly taste the grapefruit. It seems like the hops dance around the grapefruit. Throughout each sip, different bits of hops enter, but always back to juicy, citrusy goodness. Wonderfully bitter in the finish, there's a pine-like taste buried in as well. Very well-balanced! Even a bready yeast bit thrown in there.  The dry finish keeps you going back for more, lots more.

This isn't neccessarily my style, but for what it is and the hop fanatics toward whom it's targeted, I think it is a really nice example of the style. It poured a cloudy yellow orange colour with a snow white foamy head. It actually looked a bit like orange juice with white foam on top. Nice sticky white lacing coats the sides of my pint glass. The smell is very citrusy, which is a bit amusing since this looks a little like Sunny Delight. Actually, the hops are just about all I can smell in this one. Taste is pretty much juicy, bitter, citrusy hops all the way through. Not much else. This is certainly aptly named. Mouthfeel is right on target for the style. I could certainly see having a few of these later on in the summer when it's hot out.

Pilsner-like in it's presentation.  Taste was not as bitter as expected. Juicy citrus sweetness and only enough bitterness to counter. There was enormous hops flavor, but without the scorching bitterness. Mineral traces (?). Almost like a pilsner on hop steroids. A very unique DIPA.

Smell is orange and grapefruit, some pine...smells somewhat sweet but also bitter. The citrusy hops smell delicious, however, and for me the nose is the real strength of this beer. Taste starts off very citrusy, orange and grapefruit but mostly orange, but bittering hops soon take over and overpower everything else. There's a subdued malt sweetness but the malt backbone really doesn't stand a chance against the hops...making it pretty unbalanced. Moutfeel is slick and somewhat creamy.  I like this beer but I can't session it...the bitter hop bite lingers too long and is just too strong to have more than 1 or 2. In fact, 1 is pretty much enough.  I am a hophead so I enjoyed this brew, but I poured half a bottle for my brother in law who I am nursing into better beer and it ripped his palate to shreds.

345,14916,Damian,3.65,"Drank on-tap at Eli Cannon's Tap Room, Middletown, CT  Poured a clear, straw yellow with a tight, foamy, white head that slowly faded to a thick ring of lace. Large drips of lacing fell all along the glass.  Aroma was sweet, fruity and quite fragrant with some leafy hoppiness hiding in the background. Notes of granny smith apples, tropical fruits and cotton candy came through strong.  The taste however was drastically different than the nose. Biting, citrusy hops attacked the palate from the start and never let up. A soft malty base was present, but it seemed to do far more in terms of mouthfeel than flavor. As for the flavor, it changed little as the beer moved along the palate. The hops turned more puckering, dry and bitter and a slight alcohol kick was apparent in the back of the mouth. The long-lasting finish was incredibly dry, hoppy and almost astringent at times. I cannot remember the last time I had a beer that made me so thirsty.  Body was medium for the style with a rich, creamy and frothy mouthfeel.  While this beer excelled in many aspects, its lack of balance and complexity made it rather unappealing.

D: would be higher, if as i stated at least twice now this beer could stand alone better. i think this beer would be great with burgers or pizza, or similar fair, but as a beer to just sit back and enjoy, its a bit too unbalanced and dry for me. still a very good beer though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Dukeofearl,3.68,"$11.99 (?) or more for a 6 pack at Lone Hill Liquor in Glendora, CA. in March 2006. Reviewed the last bottle of the bunch.  Pours a pretty, clear golden amber with a nice very white fluffy head that drops to a nice cover that hangs around a bit. Stickage all over the walls of the Imperial pint glass.  Aroma is hoppy- but what hoppy? Very aromatic, grassy, weedy- a field of overgrown grass and lots of weeds in bloom on a warm spring day after the dew lifts. I am both drawn to it and repelled simultaneously. Slight oiliness.  Flavor follows through with lots of sharp oily hops. Slightly sweet maltiness hidden underneath- honey and whole grain bread, maybe even molassas. I like it and don't like it at the same time.... what a concept. Rich and full mouth, astringent at the end.  I'll admit, I have really mixed feelings of this after a six pack (not all at once, of course). In some ways, I do like it, in others it is really not the hops bill that I like. So what to do? I guess the answer is that is interesting, I am glad to try it, good show Victory, thanks for the chance, but now I'll move on to something I know I like.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Atlas1,4.17,"Ah, the Hop Wallop, how you continue to impress...  Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass. The Wallop appears an opaque golden color with a fat, bubbley two-finger head on top. Kinda looks like a Belgian white due to the cloudy nature of it. The head eventually settles, leaving a thick ring of intricate lace all around the glass. Very cool. The bouquet is hoppy and strong. I don't know what kind of hops are used in this beer, but it honestly smells like marijuna. Not joking. It has that sticky cannibas scent to it. But it's hoppier, with some citrus and some pine. What a great aroma. I should've poured this into a snifter to really capture everything. Taste is sweet up front, with malty notes of lemon, pineapple, and pear. The middle begins to shift into a tangy bitterness. And the finish is stong, hoppy, and bitter. Leaves a heavy bitter aftertaste. Man, I really like this beer. Very drinkable for such a potent IPA. You can tell that there's some alcohol here, but it's not overwhelming at all. It's more subdued by the strong bitter finish. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Another very nice beer by the folks at Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,kajerm,3.75,"Bottled marked ""enjoy by Nov 06 2007,"" a gift from a very good friend. Pours blush-orange into a giant wine glass. The head is a film of big soapy bubbles; terrific lacing, as I'd expect for the style.  The aroma is eye-stinging pine resin and grapefruit. Hoppy, hoppier, hoppiest.  There is fleeting evidence of a bicuity malt backbone in the opening, but the taste quickly turns into mouth-scarring hops that rape and pillage your mouth. A mouthful of this beer stimulates the bitter tastebuds on the back of my tongue to an almost unbearable extent.  Holy living fuck, this is a hoppy beer.  The mouthfeel is creamy but a bit thin, and the carbonation isn't as brisk as I'd like for a DIPA.  All told, the most single-mindedly hoppy DIPA I've ever tasted in my life. There's an element of this beer that I really like-- it's completely dedicated to pure, unbalanced hoppiness for its own sake, and I respect the goal. Victory has followed West Coast brewing to its logical conclusion on the East Coast. It's not complex, and it's not particularly imaginative, but it's most definitely an extreme beer and an honest one. This is a tunnel-vision beer, and if I'm ever in the mood for hops without any other flavors or smells to get in the way, I'll know exactly where to look.  Not a session beer, but it could be if you ripped your tongue out, I guess.  RERATE: Consumed cold on my friend's advice. Primary hop aroma becomes less dominant, and I notice a faint orangey smell. I noticed this in the previous bottle as well, but it was so slight that I thought I might be hallucinating it to meet the word count. Flavor is the same as before, but the bitterness becomes a bit less edgy-- more drinkable but less interesting.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Smell is of pine with the faintest of grapefruit. Taste is just the right amount of grapefruit with the faintest hint of pine. Hmm. Mouthfeel is nice and full bodied, just the right amount of thickness. Very little bitter aftertaste. One of the easiest drinking DIPA's i've ever had the pleasure of trying. Sure, you can find one with more bitterness, or less balance, but why would you want to?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,cueball52,4.08,"It pours a yellow gold with a frothy white head. The head has some staying power too. It starts about 1"" thick and slowly settles to about 1/4"" then stops leaving a frothy rim about the glass. The appearance is a little cloudy but clean (no floating particles). The aroma is a citrus, orange, grassy smell. The first taste bursts out with hops and is followed with the warmth of alcohol. It leaves a nice sharp bitter after taste. After the second drink there is still a small head and heavy lacing around the glass. It also has a nice full bodied mouth feel.

Taste is nice, really thick grapefruit, caramel, floral/citrus, bit of a bitter astringency, almost plasticy, nice full bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is nice, full bodied, medium carbonation.

345,14916,kdmorse,4.62,"Mmm...  Now that I live in SoCal, I'm in the land of IPAs. I recently visited San Diego and was impressed by every IPA that I laid lips upon, but Victory has shown that PA knows a thing or two about IPA.  All-around grapefruity and sweet. Hops for all the right reasons. Malt is there, but who cares. This is a wallop of hops, just as promised. Sweet, fruity, floral, fresh.  Drawbacks: A little paler than expected and the head didn't hang around. A little light in the mouth, but that makes it all the more drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BeerZack,4.3,"First off, I dunno if I would call this a double IPA... this beer is deceptively smooth and light bodied. It shows less malt character than most IPAs. With that said, I love this beer! Pours a golden straw and fairly clear with nice white head that sticks. Not too much smell for me, but faint citrus. The taste in here is grapefruity hops all the way home. Feels nice and smooth in the mouth and leaves a bitter grip on your tongue and cheek for a few seconds after you swallow. The best thing about this beer to me is its drinkability. The lack of a sweetish malt character to balance the hops is what makes this beer so great. I can drink my hops without filling up on syrupy brew. The high drinkability I rate this beer is when served pretty cold... a sweet and slightly alcohol taste comes up when it heats up... so drink it cold and fast! 8.5% alcohol by volume, its like a 40oz... but its 12oz; and it tastes good, and it cost 3X's as much...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,kpantz,3.4,"Executive Summary: This is not your mother's Imperial IPA. It departs from the textbook style in several ways. The flavor profile leaves almost no room for malt attributes. The mouthfeel is a little thin. I would prefer to see this classified as an IPA.  Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy straw/golden color. Head is more than a finger thick and hangs fairly tight. Very good lacing. A few floaters in here.  2006 Edition - ""Enjoy by Oct 19 06""  Smell: Citrus and pine hops are about all I get. No malt detectable here.  Taste: Similar in profile to the smell - fairly one-dimensional in that you get little to no malt character and a full-blown hop blast. Hop flavors mix nicely, and the bitterness is something to be reckoned with. Malt is only present enough to keep the hops from ripping holes in your tastebuds.  Mouthfeel: Not nearly as thick or sticky as most other Imperial IPAs I've had. In fact, this one feels more like an aggressive IPA. Light to moderate carbonation doesn't get in the way of the hops.  Drinkability: While an exercise in hop domination, this one isn't perfectly balanced, and I'd be hard-pressed to put more than two of these away in a session. My taste buds are already asking for something different after one bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,dickroop,4.45,"This ale pours a hazy honey-straw color, remarkably light color for a DIPA. I compared and it is only a shade darker than a Miller High-Life (but nowhere near as clear, for the haziness). There wasn't much head, but, oddly enough, a little lacing hung around. The small was citrus, specifically grapefruit.  The taste was grapefruit and slightly grassy. This taste is so grapefruit, it makes me think of the little glass bottles you once could buy in the convenience stores, about 7 oz bottles of Tropicana Grapefruit Juice, containing bitter gray juice. Well, this beer reminds me of that but it's better. In the mid-palate there was the *faintest* momentary hint of sweetness, banished in a millisecond by everlasting bitterness. The finish is a little grainy and bitter.  Mouthfeel was clean and astringent. It has a pretty light body, well carbonated, and little to no apparent heat from the alcohol. A little chewey.  Drinkability is great for a DIPA, very easy drinking. There's no doubt this could sneak up on you, but many of the downsides of DIPAs are not here, the oversweetness, the readily apparent contribution of alcohol to the taste. For the unrepentent hophead, this is remarkable stuff, highly recommended.  Addendum: I enjoyed this ale on cask at the Barcade in Brooklyn, NY, May '09. What great stuff. There was minimal head or lacing, but the aroma had lemony and apricot elements. Quaffing yielded lingering bitterness, with alcohol evident. Mouthfeel was slightly oily. Could drink it all night.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Absumaster,4.1,"Thanks to jasonm for this!  A golden, yellow beer with a thin, bubbly head.  Smell is citric hoppy (oranges) with blackberries, some fruit and hard candy. Light grapefruit and in the back some moist basement smell. I didn't know how to descirbe this in a better way.  Taste is bitterrrr, like raw hops resulting in a resinous, piney and oily hoppiness. There is very little malt to be tasted, this beer is 99% about hops. The remaining 1% is slightly biscuity and bready. I like it to be a little more malty. Some blackberry and red fruit add a nice touch to an otherwise somewhat one-dimensional beer. Mouthfeel is mild. Drinkability is very good, once my mouth got used to the bitterness (numbed), it went down easily.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Boppar,3.65,"Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into my trusty pint glass.  A first glance revealed a golden-orange color and about 1.5 fingers of head, which diminished to some sturdy lacing after about 30 seconds. A fairly attractive beer.  The smell is what intrigued me, however. Zesty, citrus scents are immediately present, most noticeably sweet orange marmalade. A subdued lemon rind smell lingers in the backgorund.  The first sip is a pleasant surprise. Not only is the orange marmalade readily apparent, but there are also some sweet malty notes, and here's the kicker: the faintest hint of white pepper. This beer has a lot going on in the flavor department, yet everything meshes together to make for an enjoyable drinking experience.  The mouthfeel is nothing spectacular, but it seemed to work really well for this style of beer. It is thick enough to help you from getting into trouble with the 8.5% ABV, but thin enough for an IPA.  All in all, a delightful offering, but between the high-ish ABV and the massive hop presence, I wouldn't want to have more than one at a time. But I will certainly enjoy the rest of this six-pack, one wallop at a time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Would gladly have some over the Hop Devil on their other tap given the chance to since this DIPA is more rare to find. which I did. Poured yellowish with perhaps a bit of a red blush to it. (bar lighting made it hard to see with much certainty) Head disappeared rapidly. Packed an aroma full of sharp resiny hop. flavor agrees -- the name is no lie, it does pack a hop wallop. But not as refined a hop flavor as in say Three Floyds' or Legacy's DIPAs, but plentiful resiny/floral. Do find myself wishing for just a bit more malt to support the hops and a bit more in the mouthfeel department. It does come across as just a little thin in mouthfeel and lean in malty sweetness with a strange sharpness to the overall impression coming out of the very direcy assault of piney hops. Worth a try if you can find it. but definitely no session beer because of the high ABV it also carries.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ArrogantB,3.9,"I bought a case of this based upon reviews and online chatter. I was slightly disappointed in that I ended up with way too much Hop Wallop. The color was yellow, bright yellow with a stark white head. The smell was a little ammonia and hoppy. The taste was ""catty"" and hoppy.

The first taste was a full on hops rush. I could get a little citrus and lemon zest at the end, but the hops pretty much ran this show. After the initial assault on my tastebuds, the next few sips seemed to calm down, more of the citrusy notes came through and it actually became quite smooth and drinkable.

No strong aftertaste and the hops are aparent without being overbearing.  MF: Well carbonated, very smooth and creamy.  D: Watch out, cause one could drink quite a few of these in one sitting.

The aroma here is weak - faint sweetness and big hop bitterness coming through in aroma with some citrus notes present. Tastes as it is named - massive hop bitterness comes through immediately. Not very sweet for a DIPA, the malt has only a small place before the big hops come through. The individual flavors are nice but this is very lacking in the way of balance because of the massive hops. This is a very deceptive 8.5% ABV as well.

The aroma I get here is like a metallic earthiness, it's real subtle though. It might be like a certain english hop type aroma. It's actually reminding me of a pilsner type aroma.

Quite citrusy in the nose and translates perfectly to the flavor profile. Resiny and citrus make up the jist of this brew. The brew while flavorfull ends up being very dry wich to my palate is a perfect fit. Hop oils don't linger at all as this cleans up nicely. 12oz bottles for a specialty offering is always a nice touch.  Notes: DIPA's that take this approach will get my money time and time again.

345,14916,NolateM,4.37,"*NOTE: The following review is my OLD review of Hop Wallop. The 2007 version of this beer changed drastically, into a more sweet, more typical DIPA. This is what it used to be like:  Appearance: Golden-yellow. Slightly hazy. Almost makes me wonder if I accidentally picked up a Prima Pils instead.  Smell: Fresh, hoppy, a little bit lemony.  Taste: Like a monsoon of lemon juice flooded a gigantic pine forest. But in a good way, somehow. It's absolutely bursting with lemon-zesty hoptacular awesomisity. Just a touch of malty sweetness, outweighed by a tangy golden-grapefruit (and lemon) bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Well-carbonated, easy-going down, and leaves no dry-mouth feeling.  Drinkability: Extremely easy to drink.. Yet it's a double IPA. How is this 8.5%???  It's like Prima Pils decided to turn into an ale and eat some Flintstones chewable lemon flavored steroids. And I absolutely love it. This beer is truly excellent. If you don't like it... well, frankly I don't think we can be friends.

Smell: Fruity hop profile, juicy hops are complimented with pineapple and pine trees. Unlike other DIPAs, there is no trace of brown sugar/molasses. Also some notes of hay.  Taste: The beer slides on to the palate with a citrus sweetness, pineapple, orange rind, light malt on the tip of the tongue, hop profile then takes over. Hops are tangy and big, they linger, dry, citrus. Alcohol is not noticeable.  Mouthfeel: Medium smooth body, juicy, solid medium carbonation, prickly, clean and crisp.

Smell is very citrusy, piney, fruity, hoppy...everything you can ask for in a DIPA. Hardly any malt which is fine by me, hops dominate this brew and give an outstanding bitterness that makes you ask for more. Very little carbonation with very little head but a consistent lace.

Pours dark golden with a small white head, leaving a dense white lace in its path. Although I was careful on the pour, my beer wound up with a lot of particles floating around in it.  The smell is predominantly pine hop mixed with light citrus esters. Alcohol is nowhere to be found considering the 8.5 % abv.  The taste is overwhelming bitterness with only a touch of spice leading to a dry but lasting bitter finish.

345,14916,PBRstreetgang,4.47,"Pours a dirty straw hue, with a dull clarity. A thick and creamy two finger head forms and holds a firm cap producing sticky whisps of lace. Pilsener and lightly toasted pale malt aromas serve as a backdrop for floral/spicy noble hops and a myriad of fresh American hop cone aromas like spruce tips, grass clippings and a more subtle Cascade/Chinook fruity scent. The first sip is sweet with Two-row and Pilsener sharpness. Bursting with resinous flavors of citrus, grapefruit rind, pine sap, and deep earthy tones. A slight fruitness and eventual dryness come in the deliciously bitter aftertaste. Medium-full bodied with a very fine and light carbonation is not so crisp as to demean the pleasently oily mouthfeel, but does prevent cloying. Despite the ferocious hop character, it never becomes abrasive, and a true hop-head will find this beer both satisfying and quaffable. A hop bomb in rare form.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Hops are piney and citrusy. nothing too much else going on there but those 2 aromas.  Taste. Citrus flavor dominates with a sharp hop citrusness that is not that bitter. Natural pine flavors come out as well, just like in the aroma. Aftertaste is nice with a malty taste that accompanies the hops. Then the hop bitterness really jumps back in.  Mouthfeel. Nice mouthfeel, but not as fulll as other 2ipas are. But it does fill my mouth up well.  Overall, i like this one. Compared to 2ipas i am used to, it is rather different. It's a lighter 2ipa, but it's nice to have something like this on the market. It's one i wish i could get often where i want a hoppy beer, but without the flavors ripping out my tongue.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,rayjay,4.42,"Thanks, zrrbrrt, for the nice surprise! BB Oct 23 07.  Great 2xIPA that has a nice pale grain bill and has way more hops than necessary....my kind of brew! Something I'd expect out of San Diego. The nose is full of hoppy white grapefruit and biscuits. Pucker up, the hops pack a hell of a bitter punch. Bitterness that lingers for quite a spell. Malts are out of the picture...I guess they gave up many hops ago. They certainly served their purpose; those yeast didn't quit till they got her to 8.5%. Now the alcohol...I knew it was there, but I honestly don't know if I'd guess it was that potent if I hadn't known the strength, especially from the very modest pale ale mouthfeel; akin to Homo Erectus, which pulled the same trick on me. Very well done, Victory, this beer can hang with the finest 2xIPAs...from any coast! Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jscottku21,3.97,"Tasty DIPA that truly packs a hop-wallop, this is yet another fantastic offering from Victory that does not disappoint. Those who are not into hoppy beers will not like this, however, as a huge fan of bold beers of this ilk, I was not at all disappointed.

345,14916,Kendo,3.58,"A: Cloudy light golden with a small white head. No head retention whatsoever despite some slow-rising bubbles refortifying it. It did leave lots of nice looking clumps of lacing on the way down.  S: Over-the-top bittering hops seem to be responsible for the scents: lemony bitterness, wet hay and grassy hops. Also something not altogether pleasant that reminded me faintly of cat pee.  T: All hops once again -- and mainly the bittering hops at that. Dry grassy and lemony bitterness dominate -- at times this feels like chewing a lemon peel; I wrote ""tongue-curling bitterness."" Hard to find much else, though there is a hint of other hoppy flavors as well, mainly pine and then a minerally bitterness that lingers well into the aftertaste. Hop wallop indeed. I discern no malt at all, though I do feel the alcohol warmth on the way down.  M: Pretty light in body, especially for a beer that's categorized as a DIPA.  D: OK. Better if you're a hophead just looking for a hop assault.  Notes: I understand the DIPA style is relatively new and arguably there's still a lot of wiggle room in what a DIPA should be. IMHO, this isn't it -- it's too light in appearance and feel and WAY too unbalanced. I felt this was like taking a half-pound of fresh hops, putting them into a cheese cloth and wringing out every bit of hop juice -- then diluting it with about 6 ounces of water and garnishing with a wedge of lemon. At least there's truth in advertising: this is definitely a hop wallop.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Citrusy grapefruit hops that is.Taste started off as slighty sweet grapefruit and ended bitterly with hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. The ale was nicely carbonated.

345,14916,Jwaks,2.67,"Serving 12oz bottle freshness date best before Oct 07  With the ignoble and unbecoming looks of a translucent pale yellow macro lager this brew pours with a very quickly dissipating dismal white head that leaves nearly no lace behind. Respectable columns of find to course bubbles welling up through the sickly yellow body is this beer's only saving grace on appearance.  Sharp aromas of acidic lemon, astringent citrus, yeast, dry grass and minerals with a metallic edge come through on the nose.  This brew comes closer to an english bitter style, or an esb such as Rogue's brutal bitter, than a DIPA. Leafy hop bitters and tons of bitter lemon zest are brutal on the palate providing a firm grip from start to finish. A bit of metallic minerals, pale malt and bitter yeast poke through on the mid palate with bitter yeast and hops taking hold on the clean finish. Grassy hops stick around to provide a fine aftertaste. Clearly, this beer lives up to it's name, but the hop flavors don't have the pulpy and juicy citrus character I crave, instead the hops come through as grassy and bitter with lots of citrus zest. Further, the hops and yeast try to pull off a solo performance without relying on malts for proper support, this leaves a nagging absence of flavor and depth.  Mouthfeel is thicker and fuller than a normal ipa with a good slick feel. This is incredibly straightforward and simple, it forfeits enough of my interest on the first to keep me from having a second.  I'm a big fan of Victory's brews but I can think of many other DIPAs that are far superior to this one including Stone Ruination, DFH 90 minute, Hercules Double IPA, Maharaja and Unearthly.  Victory?

This sucker is 8.5% and drink relatively easy (for the bitternes) and without any interferenece of balance (pick one) from malts. This is all bawdy hops flavors. Nothing nice and finished tasting like so many DIPAs.  The smell is nothing special, just sweet and bitter spice like found in Victory&#8217;s Prima Pils, a hoppy European-style lager. The flavor is an intense, wild mess of fresh hop flavors with a bitter punch.

345,14916,AltBock,3.86,"12 oz. bottle with a cartoon picture of good ol' Horace ""Hop"" Wallop. Horace Wallop is just a fictional Victory character that was made just for this beer. Horace is an old 49er who obviously loves to make hoppy beers while panning for gold. Hoppy beers to Horace is what an energy drink/coffee is to a normal American. The picture of Horace on the label is a bit odd. He has this look on his face while he is licking his lips like he sees a huge gold nugget, good food, a woman (it gets lonely out there in river while he's panning for gold), or just a hoppy beer. I don't know which, but I would have to guess he's looking at a woman. But watch out for this 49er because good ol' Horace is rabid. He has foam around the mouth like he's got rabies. He probably contracted rabies while he was panning for gold in the river and when he's back was turned to a forest, a rabid squirrel or raccoon came up from behind and bit him on the leg. Ouch! Somebody needs to put old Horace down! To the left of old Horace on the label is a nice paragraph about the legend of Hop Wallop, and ABV%. To the right of the paragraph and just under the brim of Horace's hat is a clearly marked best before date. Mine is best before Oct. 25th, 2007. To the right of Horace is just the Government warning and barcode. It's just another great Victory label that I enjoyed.  Appearance: I decided to pour Hop Wallop into my small Great Lakes Christmas Ale Snifter. What came out was a beer that was a bright yellow gold color. It's the color that is most favored by Horace himself because to a 49er like him (and to everybody else in the world) gold means big $$$. The head of foam (no pun intended because Horace has rabies) was a pearl white color and about half an inch in height. It had OK retention that left behind a trace of white rings and white lace around the glass.  Smell: When I first popped the cap off good ol' Hop Wallop, a strong aroma of bitter sweet grapefruits came out. When poured into the glass, the bitter sweet grapefruit was still there as well as piney hops, a touch of German malts, and some non-citrus fruits in the background. The non-citrus fruits aroma will get stronger if you swirl the beer around. When I first took a whiff of this beer, I got a miniature whiff of what I thought a 49er would smell like after he hasn't taken a bath in over a week. Somehow Horace got into the bottle.  Taste: On the label they say it's a VERY hoppy ale. It is true that it is a hoppy ale, but I've had beers that are much hoppier than this beer. To me, it's somewhere below very hoppy and more near extra hoppy. The initial taste is that bitter citrus hops that give way into bitter piney hops. After the hop wallop comes the citrus fruits, a pinch of grass and then that leads the flavor to a short burst of dry German malts at the end. I believe that the taste of the beer is something ol' Horace would enjoy while he's panning for gold and running away from rabid animals.  Mouthfeel: Hop Wallop is a medium bodied robust ale with an aftertaste of bitter citrus hops and dry roasted malts. Victory says the alcohol content is 8.5%, but I couldn't taste it or even feel it for that matter.  Drinkability: Was I walloped by hops? Not really, but I did however enjoy whatever the hop content was in this beer. Is it another victory for Victory Brewing? I would say so and they don't call it Victory Brewing for nothing. Would I buy it again when it's back in season? Hell yeah! It's the best beer money can buy with a rabid miner on the label!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ncvbc,4.1,"I guess it's a good thing when a beer tastes better than it looks...at least better than a good looking beer tasting bad, right? Well that's one this one is to me. Slightly above average smell because the alcohol is nearly absent although it's 8.5 here. The taste is great, though. Boom! At this point I completely understood the story on the label. For a second you think too much happiness might not be good after reading ""Happiness is hoppiness"". The taste disproves this possibility quickly. Great beer though again at 8.5 although it may seem smooth you might not be smooth.

345,14916,DGryger,3.38,"Appearance: Slightly carbonated apple juice. Extremely clear, little head formation (1/4 max) that quickly dissipated to form a ring around the glass. Little to no lacing. I would expect slightly better head formation/retention if it were warmer.  Smell: Piney hop aromas slight citrus, upon warming slightly, bitter grapefruit notes become more apparent. You can smell flowers too.  Taste: Bitter. I think that the bitterness/hops overwhelms the malt. Tastes more like an APA. I think a little more of the malt to balance the brew would help. Leaves a bitter aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. Overall the alcohol (8.5 ABV) is pretty well hidden  only a slight tingle in the aftertaste. Malt comes out and becomes more noticable with warming.  Mouthfeel: About what I would expect for this beer type. It is dry and thin, pretty light mouthfeel. Maybe a little too much carbonation.  Drinkability: If you want hoppy and bitter, this is your beer. If you want more balance, look elsewhere. I have to admit that Victory did a fine job of brewing an 8.5% ABV beer that hides the alcohol well and still maintained a decent level of drinkability (i.e., not too sweet or thick). I probably wouldnt buy this again, as I feel I can get a similar taste experience elsewhere in a more sessionable beer for less money.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

This beer has a mild piney aroma. It smells a little more malty than I was expecting. It has a slightly spicy aroma as well. It is unique for a DIPA. After sitting for a few minutes, the alcohol become noticable.  This beer has a floral hop flavor. Some pine flavor mixes in. As with the aroma, there is some spicy flavors. Odd. Also, this beer has a slightly malty sweet taste.  This beer is highly carbonated. Maybe just a little too carbonated for the style. It goes doem smooth, leaving a floral hop aftertaste.  This beer might not be the best session beer because it is mighty agressive tasting. Also, at 8.5%, it might be hard to drink this beer all night.  Overall: I was so excited to finally be able to try this beer. I was having trouble finding it. I finally found a few bottles, and jumped at the chance. I think I was expecting more than I got.

Hops, hops and more hops. Very warm alcohol. Pine needles and HUGE citrus peel hops dominate this beer in every sip. There's an initial malt presence and an overall malt backbone but in the end it's nothing but hops. Very bitter and tastes like you're chewing on a combination of aspirin and salt.

I love hoppiness in a beer so it's not a problem for me, but others might be turned off by its dependence on the hoppy flavor. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation, and a strong, lasting bite is saved for the back of the tongue. Lacks complexity, though.

Smell - Really nice citrus with a note of spice. Smell could've been a bit more powerful thugh.  Taste - The strong citrus flavors come first and do a good job of balancing the hops.

345,14916,Beertracker,3.62,"Victory Hop Wallop is best served at cool, cellar temperatures (40-50°F) and enjoyed from a traditional pounder or from your favorite drinking vessel. This fall seasonal from Victory pours up very nicely with ample carbonation that creates a short-lived white head that sits atop a slightly hazy, straw-golden body. The hugely fruity aroma is decidely grainy and not-surprisingly very hop oriented with plenty of grapefruity, citrusy tones with just a light dusty note that detracts some from the overall impression. The flavor starts off with some light graininess from the continental malts, but is eventually totally subdued by the consuming bitterness from all those whole flower hops. The marked bitter finish is surprisingly dry and slightly harsh with some alcoholic warmth. This medium bodied hand-crafted India Pale Ale may be well suited for hop heads, but lacks some finesse, depth & complexity compared to the best Double IPA's. Try pairing this one with some of the restaraunt's Drunken Mussels which are freshly beer steamed Blue Mussels served in a spicy, garlic-sunrise broth with a side-order of toasted garlic bread.

Sturdy malt base to carry the hops, which were bluntly bitter, without particular floral or citrus notes, and married well with the touch of caramel in the malt. The abv was well interlaced in the flavor.  Thanks to far333 for sharing this beauty.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Teke0611,3.93,"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Looked (and smelled, at first) very similar to a Stella Artois, but a bit more yellow in color. Very clear. Not much head. Seems like this beer, ignoring its title, is a barely-over-the-top hop head beer. While I didn't dislike it, I'm not entirely convinced that I would seek it out next season. The hops are quite bitter, and there seems to be a bit too much alcohol present in the smell and taste. Nothing like 120min or Utopia, but none the less it could be toned down just a hair for better drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,bashiba,4.25,"Poured a dark cloudy yellow with a thin fizzy head quickly turning into a small soapy ring. No lacing at all.  Smell had a slight bit of spicy pepper and butter with a strong bit of grapefruit.  The taste did have some nice semi sweet malt flavors, although they were quickly overpowered by the strong grapefruity hops that left a strong mintyness in the finish.  Mouthfeel was full and oily and gave my tongue a good coating.  I enjoyed this quite a bit, a nice treat for a hophead.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,terrabyte,2.9,"Pours a crystal clear yellow, with a large white head. Surprising to see something this light.  Smells slightly musty, otherwise muted grapefruit.  Flavor is based on unripened grapefruit and their rinds. It lives up to its name of wallop as it assaults your senses with everything hops. I found little to no supporting flavors to help balance this out. It also irritated the back of my throat - which usually means I could be getting sick, but more likely because I haven't had any sleep all week. The aftertaste was quite strong of hops and reminded me of a copper penny.  Mouthful was decent. Well carbonated, medium-light heaviness. A real mouth pucker, though.  Drinkability is a mixed bag for me. Grapefruit and piny hop fad isn't really for me, but I have found over-hopped beers that are enjoyable. In every case it was because it was balanced with other pleasing flavors. This didn't have any, and it irritated my throat. All the burning I felt might not be attributed to the hops though, I was quite surprised to see the high ABV. I never would have guessed. I was too busy being walloped. Solid, but unbalanced beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Ieatlambfries,4.1,"2006 brewing. Served in a tulip.  This double poured a very hazy light orange. Medium fluffy white head comprised of very fine, tight bubbles. The head leaves a scant coating of thin spotty lacing.  The smell is dominated by citrus overtones. Resiny hops with a faint smell of salt water.  The initial flavor is grapefruit rinds. Very bitter piney hop resins followed some suggestions of canned pineapple. Some slight sweet malts in the background with the barest hint of alcohol in the finish.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied. It leaves a bit of an oily feel on the tongue.  Above average drinkability considering the higher abv. Excellent flavor, yet the high ibu's can be some what numbing to the tongue and palate.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,maundythirsty,3.9,"Hazy golden beer with some random bubbling and a quarter-inch white head that loads up the glass with sticky lacing. Smell is sweet and thick with hops of the pine and citrus variety. An inviting little whiff of the alcohol, too.  Taste is pretty straightforward. It's bigtime hops -- syrupy pineapple and sour grapefruit with a pretty serious aspirin bitterness that carries along for some time n the aftertaste. Spicy alcohol bite. Thick and smooth moutfeel with light carbonation.  I'm torn. I don't know that I would sit down with more than one or two of these. There is not much malt presence in this beer, making it more of a hophead's delight and less my kind of more balanced DIPA. But I like it all the same.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,joeskirkie,4.22,"Hop Wallop was my first ever beer review, and was my highest rated beer for quite some time. I thought I owed it to myself to re-review it now that I have a good handle on the reviewing process.  So anyways, I finally found this year's release and picked it up.  In the snifter It is golden with thin white head.  The nose is MUCH more defined than what I picked up the first time, citrusy, limey, basically intense hops.  On the tonuge once again it's the bitterness that comes through the most at first. A subtle hint of the citrus from the nose, but the bitterness finishes and lingers.  It's a fairly light, smooth body. And of course I'd gladly have another.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Abita45,4.29,"I've been keeping an eye out for this and picked up a six pack from Capone's, a resturant/outstanding beer take-out place on Germantown Pike near Norristown (learned of this place from BA's calander).  Pours to a very nice cloudy straw color. Rather than the straw color most associate with macro-lights, this is a more dense straw, though not deep enough to be called gold. It has a nice head, that reduces relatively quickly but there is foamy lacing on the glass and a thin head endures for most of the beer. The aroma is immediate and, as one would expect, sweetly hoppy and citric.  The taste mirrors the aroma as it is a strongly hopped beer with a prominent floral flavor and a more subtle citric tone. While it is a heavily hopped beer, it also has a very clean taste without the astringency or dryness usually found in some IPA's or double IPA's.  Victory makes some good beers, and I am very much a fan of this one. It has a nice biting taste to it, but it is not overwhelming. The hops are loaded up just for the sake of bitterness, but really add to the beer and make it flavorful. An excellent double IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,FtownThrowDown,4,"Wow! I think I'm slowly becoming a hop-head. I was fighting it, not wanting to join the darkside. This beer pours a golden amber with only a slight head forming on the glass. Very good lacing throughout the entire glass. The smell is, would you guess it, hops. Plenty of hops and all kinds of hops. I'm getting some citrus smells as well as some resiny floral hops. The taste is very close to the smell. An all out attack on the taste buds with some overly bitter hops controlling all senses of taste. The bitterness is only during the sip though. No lip puckering or squinting coming as a result of this beer. Quite enjoyable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Melchizedek,3.58,"Pours with a nice two-finger head, a lovely light bronze, crystal-clear and with steady, light carbonation supporting the durable, sticky lace.  Nose shows off what's to come - hop, hop, hop. Plenty of citric and resin textures in there, some grapefruit all the way to pine bark, with a bit of a hop ""musk,"" if that makes sense. In the mouth, very slick and oily, a bit lighter than expected, with all the hops you could hope for. Lots of bitterness, a little bit of that citrus character, an almost minty herbal note somewhere in there. It's hard to concentrate on the flavors through the assault. Kind of puckering in the finish, and the alcohol doesn't hide too craftily.  Intense, and should be reserved for a serious hop jones. Wouldn't want to tackle more than one in a sitting, but it's worth trying for the novelty of unadulterated hop juice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,CAMRAhardliner,4.8,"If you like hops, welcome to the party!  Pours a gold color with a bubbly white head that quickly recedes to a foamy ring. Stratified lacing is plentiful on the glass. The aroma is redolent with sweet fresh pineapple juice with some grapefruit and pine bitterness on the edges.  The taste is very different to the nose, less pineapple, sweet hops and more brash grapefruit. There are some piney notions are in the background but this beer is a grapefruit bomb. Malt flavors are very subdued under the barrage of hops. Alcohol is impeccably well hidden, revealing just a bit of warmth on the swallow. The mouthfeel is light and very puckering from the hop oils. The finish is extremely bitter.  This beer is heavenly. So much hop flavor, so much bitterness. What more could you want?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

I am normally a fan of Victory Brewing (Storm King is one of my favorite beers) and I am normally a fan of really hoppy beers (Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA comes to mind, even Hop Devil from Victory)... So I expected that I would really like this... So much so, I bought a whole keg... Oops. Bottom line? The things that I think of when I drink this beer are grapefruits (citrus), multi-vitamins (herbs) and alcohol. I know this is supposed to be hoppy, but to me, the beer is out of balance...

345,14916,malcontent,4.04,"Beautiful clear, golden amber body with a generous two fingers of head.  Hops are undeniably at the forefront of this brew (the piny variety) but it's the sophisticated malt profile that impresses; buttered bread, cloves and amber malt carry the aroma. Nice.  Hops once again lead, although this time it's all spice and grapefruit. A rich rye flavor prevails post-hops and a lovely bready quality lingers on the long finish. Excellent.  Although the body is appropriately balanced there is an unmistakable oiliness to the finish. I love drinking this brew although the palate-busting nature of the oily hop residue somewhat diminishes the drinkablity.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BlindPig,4.8,"A- 1/4"" white head on a pretty clear golden body. S- Grapefruit and a bit of orange citrus hops. A good helping of piney hops too. T- Citrus and piney hops balance them selfs out with each other. Hops just fill the mouth with a very little pale malt back ground. Grapefruit just blends with the pine flavor very well. Alcohol also comes in and tingles the tongue a little and then warms up the back of the throat. Hints of a few other fruits like oranges and lemons. Has a great complex hop aroma and flavor. M- Medium to full body with low to medium carbonation. D- This is a really good DIPA. It really does make its self stand out amount all the other DIPAs that are good just kind of blend together in memory. I think it really takes DIPAs to a new level.

Poured aggresively into a pint glass - not much head at all and it goes away fast leaving some sturdy lacing both on the surface and on the sides of the glass. Cloudy pale yellow/orange in color, this is one pretty looking beer. Smells like apricot, spruce, and citrus - very crisp. Hoppy bitterness throughout the taste (big surprise) with some citrus undertones and a dry, clean finish. There's a little too much carbonation here, but it's necessary in order convey these flavors. Still, a bit too dry on the finish. Regardless, this is an all night beer if you ask - very refreshing.

Left small amount of lacing on my glass. Smelled nicely of bitter hops , grapefruit juice, pine and maybe some lemon zest. Had a very malty, hoppy , citrus like taste with little carbonation. The hops pretty much dominate this beer from front to back and disquise any alcohol totally. The hops are a little on the overwhelming side and aren't balanced well with the rest of the flavors, but was rather smooth. Bit of a sipper in my opinion.

Aromas are really faint, and what I notice is bitter and citrus like.  Flavors are interesting. Beer has a nice bitter citrus hop finish, but it lacks a bit up front except for a dry character. Also noted a bit of a metallic and an asprin like character.  Mouthfeel is a bit above average... but nothing special. This beer tends to be a bit weak up front.  This is an odd DIPA. It seems to be out of balance. Not much malt flavor... hops are there, but not quite right either. (and I really like hoppy beers...) This is drinkable, but it strikes me as being an average DIPA.

345,14916,Chaz,4,"Pours pale golden in color, head is a frothy off-white finger. Hop Wallop appears rather clear, but is actually slightly hazy, and shimmers lazily amid the bar's diaphonous phosophorescent murk, much like iron pyrite in a muddy riverbed, and it's an apt (if overly poetic) description given this beer in its humble surroundings here in a familiar-yet-unnamed drinking emporium. The nose is perfumey from half a meter, even despite the trademark funk of the place, a familiar melange of spent yeast, live bacteria, and bleach. Kudos to the folks at Victory for producing a beer that outperforms this epic funk! The head settles unhurriedly, with notable retention and lacing. The nose is piney -citric and quite bitter. Malt? Sure, it's in there somewhere, but it is completely sublimated on the nose by way of the hop profile. In fact, for many unfamiliar with the style the nose may come of as slightly harsh, but I find it to be on-style as such. Yikes! Pineapple/grapefruit with equal parts sweet/tangy/sharp hop overload, hell of a first sip, and should scare off the timid and unfamiliar. Second sip proves this to be juicy, dry and cleansing . . . if I said slightly abrasive / palate-scrubbing would you hold it against me? Didn't think so, but it' all there, and as I type this review some 135 minutes after drinking my first sip I know there's some serious alpha acid action going on here in Hop Wallop '06. Seems a bit too thin, a bit too light in body, and that makes it a bit too drinkable for it's own good - definitely ""dangerously drinkable"". Highly astringent, but all from the hop - there's no trace of lactic-sour contribution here. Slightly one-dimensional until it warms up a bit, at which point the malt backbone begins to appear from behind the woodshed ready for the final pigpile/melee at the end. Fruity qualities to the malt? Sure, but only after it warms about ten or fifteen minutes . . . think Hi-C fruit punch cut with some fresh-squeezed ruby red grapefruit, but in a dialed-down from 10 to 3 sort of proportion.

The most bittering hop flavors I've ever tasted in a beer. The finish of the beer is quite bitter and drying. Impressively long and drawn out. Could last an hour if you don't eat or drinkn anything else. Not incredibly complex.  Mouthfeel: Cloyingly dry. Alcohol is present and presents some warmth.  Drinkability: Wow.

I was surprised when I poured the beer into a pint glass-- it was much lighter in color than I thought it would be. When I put my nose into the glass the aroma made me want to taste the beer-- nice and hoppy!  I love the fact that this is not as citrusy as other strong IPAs. It goes down VERY easily for an 8.5%ABV brew. The mouthfeel is actually lighter than I would expect for an IPA.  This beer is all about hops.

Poured into an oversized wine glass, my stand-in for a goblet. The beer is a golden color with a bit of a haze to it, foamy white head that fades almost instantly to a peninsula of bubbles floating off of western side of the glass. Only slight lacing, that disappears for good when I swirl my glass, though the swirl brings back a nice layer of foam each time.  Smell is huge with hops. Floral, fruity as well as hints of sweetness, almost like pineapple. Delicious to my nose.  Wow, this is STILL a bitter beer, but fresh it tastes like I'm drinking distilled grapefruit juice. The high ABV is apparent, but its masked nicely by the bitterness here. The sip goes from a touch of sweetness, to that grapefruit flavor to the taste of raw hops in the finish. This seems like what hop juice would taste like. Intense. As it warms, the bitterness seems to mellow out, bring out a lot more fruitiness.  Mouthfeel is crisp and definitely drying. Pretty light in body and not sticky or cloying at all.  This beer's a sipper, both due to flavor and high ABV.

No malt profile to speak of. The lack of malt balancing leaves this beer tasting thin, one-dimensional and heavy handed.

Surprisingly strong bitterness that lingers throughout the finish. Definite warming alcohol. Very dry and clean.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Sticky and resinous.  A must try for a hop head. But for me this DIPA was too one dimentional. Massive hops are great, but I would have enjoyed something to balance it.

This beer pours a bit paler than other DIPAs I've had, but has abundant head which started to form really sticky lacing before my first sip. The smell is a piney hop, and wonderful. This beer is extremely hoppy but definitely has a different quality than many other very hoppy APAs and DIPAs. I didn't find this beer to be extremely citrusy, but rather had pine flavor notes that I found to be extremely crisp and delicious. This piney-nous makes the beer very drinkable while still being very bitter. Mouthfeel is not as sticky as some of the super-citrusy pale ales I've previously tasted. I really enjoyed this beer and thought it highly drinkable.  Another a great product by Victory.

When tasting, there is a hint of alcohol characteristics near the front of the tongue, followed by a brief jaunt into sweetness. The mouth is then walloped by the grapefruit flavors of the hops. The beer mellows a little as it comes up to room temperature, and sweetens a little as well. After it leaves the mouth, there is a hint of bitterness mixed with some tartness on the tongue.

Nose: This is an extremely aromatic herbal, earthy with cloves type hop scent. Mldly sweet malt scent way down.  Taste: A hearty herbal, earthy, hop flavor that is rather bold and complex. The hop flavor is a diverse array of earthy, bitter and leafy flavors. It never really becomes fruity or citrusy, there is no tangy edge to this hop just a robust heartyness with a wheaty and herbal overall effect. There is a mildly sweet malt tinge but certainly dominated by the hops.  MF: Light, crisp and clean with a medium body for the style.

Slight chill haze, head is a decent half-inch of fine bubbles that holds up well enough. Bright citrus hops in the aroma, mostly orange and grapefruit. The nose is very tangy with a floral pungence also, not much here from the malt.  The taste is very much the same blend of citrus hop flavor, except it carries a slight sour astringence accompanying the bitterness at the end. It's unfortunately a bit unpleasant and overpowers the other flavors to a degree. Also, there isn't much to experience as the taste is relatively the same from the start to finish. The body is somewhat light, with a fairly strong carbonation.  I was expecting alot more from this beer but it let me down some. The bitterness rides high on the tongue, and isn't the same lasting pleasant sensation you get from many great IPA's. I might try this beer again.

The head has great retention. Thick rings of lacing remain on my glass.  Smell: Piney hops and sweetned grapefruit and citrus zest.  Taste: The beer delivers a pine oily hop intially. This gives way to grapefruit and grassy hops. The hop flavor spans the entire flavor of the beer. In the middle of the taste is a malty sweetness backing up the hops.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer has a buttery hop oily mouthfeel. The body of the beer is medium plus. This is a very smooth beer.

Nice lacing too. ;^)  The smell is hugely hoppy. Lot's of grapefruit in the nose that is very nice.  The taste is very big on the hops at first sip, grapefruit and a bit of grass, but after a few more sips, there is a definite malt presense that somewhat balances out the flavour. This is yummy. I really like the fact that the DIPAs I've tried can be so different in their interpretation and *still* all be pleasing to my palate. The finish, for me, is where the malt hit its crescendo. Damn. A very nice example of the style and one that I'd be glad to buy again.  Bottom line: I've been eyeing this brew for a long time. I'm glad I finally got to try it.

345,14916,jwc215,4.11,"Pours gold with a thin white head that hangs on for the duration.  The smell is of strong citrus. Musty, a flash of alcohol.  The taste is of chewy, citrusy hops all over the place - grapefruit and orange. Some floral notes. Malt is subdued, but enough to tie the hops together. Sharp alcohol comes through, which often detracts, but in this case adds a zesty spiciness  Hops and alcohol in the raw. The flavor lingers. Long, dry finish.  A slow sipping brew. Hopheads rejoice, others beware.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,kirok1999,3.87,"Pours a clear light golden with a nice white head and sticky lacing. Smells at first of hops, not sure what kind, but tons of them. Taste is bittering hops, very little sweetness, long aftertaste of bitter hops. This is a hop monster, exactly what the label says it is. Slight citrus, moderate pine and grass. Sticky on the lips. Drinkable only if you love bitter hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,MVassar,3.96,"Beautiful. A clear, light gold color, and an impressive, bright, barely off-white head. Lacing lasts and lasts.  Moderate nose is dominated by hops, with some pine, and a hint grapefruit peel.  Taste is extremely hoppy, with huge pine and citrus peel flavors. Only a hint of sweetness which is quickly overtaken by the hops. (The label does say Very Hoppy Ale, after all.)  A touch of alcohol heat, and a crisp bite on the tongue, balanced by an oily, creamy texture. Long, delightfully bitter finish.  The intense hops might be a bit much for some palates, but this beer is right up my alley.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,sinistermadman,4.32,"Pours a somewhat hazy gold color with a fine head. Nice lacing after each drink. The aroma is amazing. Clearly loaded with hops with citrus, pine and even floral notes making their way in.  First sip immediately bombards you with all hop sensations. Suffice it to say you get all variants of hop flavors, but a hefty malt background provides a solid backing. Medium-full in body with a smooth presence on the palate. Alcohol peeks in as it warms, but it is not overly oppressive as some double IPAs can be. Truly a beautiful creation.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,JohnnyM2002,4.2,"Sampled from a 12 oz bottle, poured into a white wine glass at 50 degrees.  A - Pours a bubbly, clear, golden color with a quickly-dissipating white head. Sticky lacing follows the whole way down.  S - Strong scent of piney grapefruit and lingering hops. Grassy hints follow.  T - As powerful as the hops are, they are equally balanced by pine and fruit. Sweet orange and tart grapefruit pack quite the punch. Not overly bitter, but the extra-hoppy punch does follow the fruity flavors. Finishes very grassy with a slight alcohol presence. Complex to say the least, but has several very good combinations working together.  M - Medium, bubbly body that finishes with a crisp bitterness.  D - A very good example for a DIPA, but not in my top 3. Still, I love it and look forward to another in the very near future. Definitely worth picking up.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,hckyfn9999,3.96,"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a two figer white head and some very good lacing.  Smell is of spicy and floral hops. Note a very strong aroma here.  Taste biscuity malt up front. Then comes the hops. Lots of citrus here with a strong grapefruit flavor a little spicy too. Pretty tasty.  Mouthfeel is medium body with a nice level of carbonation.  A pretty drinkable beer. While not the best Double IPA I have had, this is still a very solid beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,dfried,4.27,"Very light golden in color, thin off white head mainly formed a ring and film. The aroma is filled with an array of hops, fresh floral, juicy citrus with tons of grapefruit and orange, but I felt this differed from some American DIPA's in that the aroma was dominated by skunky (in a good way) resinous hops. You definitely get walloped by hops in the taste too, tons and tons of hops, skunky, musty, and resinous are most noticeable, but packed with grapefruity citrus as well. Typical malt body for lighter colored American DIPAs, quite sweet. Tangy, taste bud stripping mouthfeel.  Verdict: one of the best of the style. This one is definitely not for the light of hop-heart though, it leans more to the very not balanced side, hop bitterness can get to be too much after a couple. I would love to try it aged or especially on cask with the bitter aspect mellowed a bit.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,treehugger02010,4.14,"I got this from Kunda Bev, in King of Prussia, Pa. I poured into a pint glass and really enjoyed. It didn't pour much head at all, and the retention of what was there was weak. The was a fair amount of lacing, but most of it left fast. The color was a very pale yellow. The smell was oh so hoppy. The taste was even better. The mouthfeel was a bit ridged, but still worked well this the wonderfully hoppy character. This is a super brew. Don't drink and review.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,tcfishler,4.42,"Bright, glowing golden orange. Sizeable white head leaving a sticky lace.  Expressive, sweet but bright, citrus-dominated aromas, with floral notes adding a bit of complexity.  Fruity sweetness on the hits the palate first, then slowly dries out into a persistent and powerfully bitter finish. Hop profile is mainly grapefruit. Alcohol is almost entirely hidden. Body is medium, while carbonation is a little low.  Delicious and dangerously drinkable DIPA, distinctive for its fruity sweetness and intense grapefruit character.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,SacoDeToro,2.47,"Poured a pale straw yellow with a small white head.  The aroma didn't really have any hops in it. I was surprised that it smelled mostly of pilsner malt with some light grainy notes.  The flavor of the beer was pretty hoppy. Mostly floral hops - not the typical citrusy/resiny Pacific NW flavors. The maltiness was light and biscuity. There didn't seem to be any fruity flavors that are typical of ales.  The mouthfeel was light and the carbonation was good. This beer was remarkably dry for being 8.5 percent.  But overall this beer didn't taste like a double IPA. In fact, it had few characteristics of any American-style ale. If this were a blind taste test, I'd peg this beer for an imperial pilsner, and not a good one at that. In fact, this beer sucked. What a disappointment from the brewery that makes my favorite pilsner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,briscott99,3.85,"Appearance: Pours a clear bright yellowish hue, no yeast floaties, short head, leaving lacings along glass.  Nose: Citrus, hops, faint sweet malt in there too. I smell green things in there, but can't narrow it down... pine, sharp smelling grass, or something along those lines.  Taste: Very bitter, wonderful grapefruit taste. The wallop has arrived and it's good. Bittering hops close in fast and hang on into a long finish. Not too much malt in there.  Mouthfeel: somewhat light bodied, low carbonation. For me it goes down easy despite the high ABV.  Overall: A good beer for hop lovers. As the title suggests, hops are the main attraction here, and I think they overwhelm the malt character of the beer a bit. But, oh well, I think it's a really good beer nonetheless. Will definitely give this one another go-round or two or three....",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,GbVDave,3.58,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a DT tulip.  A: Clear honey colored. Two finger head that quickly disappears. Mild carbonation. Lace stuck all over the glass.  S: Hoppy nose that smells of grapefruit, lemon, and something sweet like apples.  T: Lots of hops and grapefruit with a slight piney quality. Grainy malt profile. Finish is bitter, tart, and slightly medicinal. Bitterness barely cloaks the alcohol flavor.  M: Sort of thin but the hop flavors coat everything in my mouth. Astringent quality of the hops gives the impression that it strips the tongue making my mouth feel dry.  D: This one seems a little unbalanced (towards the hop side of things) and one dimentional. Drinking one always leaves me with a feeling of minor heartburn (!). Definately needs more balance. Not bad, but I've had many better DIPA's.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,srrn,4.27,"Continung through my six variety of beers. This is my first review at the computer while drinking the beer. I love Victory beers and this is my first Hop Wallop.  Minimal lacing on the pour into tulip glass fading to a ring. Clear amber color.  Smell of Pine, grass then citrus.  Taste of pine fading to a nice bitterness and citrus. Not too much grapefruit. Hop bombs can scare me a bit as the pine can become like pine sol, or on the flip side taste like grapefruit soda to my palate. This is perfectly balanced for me, like Hop Devil, which I believe this to be similar to.  Nice long finish.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BeerSox,3.42,"12oz bottle into snifter  Bright and clear colored golden hue. Decent sized head, which settles to a thin rim along the glass. Spotty lacing.  Husky grain and super high citrus smell from the hops.  Bitter alpha acids bludgeon the palate with a little bit of maltiness in the background. The alcohol is well hidden, but be careful as this beer is 8%ABV. The finish follows with the same bittering hops.  Not a horrible IPA, but I still have tried better. The bitterness was there but the flavor seemed a little off. It's at least worth a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,scooter231,4.18,"A lovely straw-colored brew, clear, with a poofy big head that leaves tons of lacing. Smells absurdly hoppy, earthy and lemony. Sour lemony. Some spices in there too, though I can't really pick out what. Taste isn't as attackingly hoppy, it's rather well-balanced actually. More lemon, more citrus, some sweetness. Quite earthy and grassy. The first time I had this I thought hop juice, but this batch is much smoother- I'm actually enjoying this one.  Mouthfeel is sudsy and not too heavy, kind of slick. Overall a really drinkable DIPA for the hop lovers. I have enjoyed other DIPAs more than this one, but this is a solid brew. And at eight and a half percent, very sneaky.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,HoustonTX,4.77,"Hop Wallop, I have so long awaited to try you. The zest, caress. Fading, right beside you.  At last, the Wallop. Poured into the glass carefully. A golden body, with shades of orange. Shining above, and gleaming. Vested, and tall, the heavens above. Frothy clouds of 1 inch or above.  Delicate smells of great amounts of citrus and rind. Grapefruit is pleasant, effervescent unlike wine. My mind in a haze, with the pleasant aroma. Smell this too long and you'll end up in a coma.  Taste is unreal, and exactly the style. A pleasant surprise, and beat the hype by a mile. A large amount of hoppiness, with the backing of malt to follow. Unexperienced palates might experience something hollow. Victory scored on this DIPA, as this is the best raw hop character to date. Unforgettable, and always worth a date.

345,14916,LongBeachHopHead,4.32,"Victory Brewing Co. Hop Wallop - Double IPA 8.5% A.B.V.  Found this beer at Wine Country in Long Beach. They just got it in and I grabbed the last six pack. I was in there couple days earlier and they didn't have it. The beer sold pretty fast if they started with four sixers...  Appearance: A golden straw color. Very clear and obviously filtered. A thick, pretty dense head is very persistant and has incredible stickiness.  Smell: Huge hops with citrus grapefruit. Lots of grapefruit. There are a lot of hops in this beer. Its not a very malty beer, just pounds of hops in all stages. Yeah, all I know is the word hops....hahaha.  Taste: On first sip, I get a lot of bitterness and piney grapefruit flavors. Its a very fresh taste which I like. Its not straight from the tit but its good.  Mouthfeel: there are tons of bittering units that grab the back of your throat. The 8.5% ABV is very complimentary to the huge hop flavor. The bitterness is amazing. How long did they boil this stuff?  Drinkabililty: Well I'm on my third one in two days so I really like it. The price out here was $10.75 a six pack which is pretty reasonable for the quality. You'd have to go to a brewery for a better DIPA. I'll be proud to pour this for a friend.  Cheers to Victory for putting out a great 12oz DIPA. Currently in my area there are no rivals in this size. Keep it flowing out to SoCal. I'm buying it!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Budlum,3.95,"Pouring this beer produces three fingers of rich, white head that slowly leaves lacing on the glass as it recedes. The body is a very clear amber with a few particles held in suspension.  As the name suggests, the nose is all about hops. The hop aroma is wonderfully fresh with strong pine and black pepper. Only a faint malt sweetness is present.  Again, the whole story of flavor is a delicious hop flavor through each sip. Hops flavors are fresh and strong with citrus oil tastes. The hop finish is quite long with only a lingering sweetness. As it warms, flavors of dandelion and romaine lettuce continue to add spice to the hop flavors.  The mouth presence lacks carbonation but it does have many creamy characteristics. The finish is quite dry.  Drinkabiliy is quite good considering the huge hop presence of this beer. Quite sippable overall but more than two of these would be tough.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Beaver13,4.32,"12 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy golden with a large creamy white head that retains well and laces the glass.  The aroma is sweet doughy malts and pungent resinous piney peppery hops.  The flavor is sweet bready malts and a little citrus followed quickly by a huge hop burst - spicy, piney and resinous with a huge lingering bitterness, but just restrained enough to not be unpleasant. The sweetness helps balance the bitterness just enough. The alcohol is well-hidden and sneaks up on you. The mouthfeel is medium, lightly carbonated and slightly watery.  Overall, an excellent DIPA! A good bang for the buck as well at $11 per 6 pack.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,abcsofbeer,3.84,"Poured from the bottle with a drink by date of Oct '07. The color is a very pale orange that is very clear. The head is a rocky, white color but pretty thin. However, there is a good amount of sticky lacing.  The aroma is a very strong, hoppy smell with a strong citrus backing. I also detect some pine notes in the aroma that is soaked in citrus oil.  The taste is a bitter leafy one, that is of extreme hoppiness. This may be the hoppiest beer that I have tasted. The mouthfeel is very tart that has a backbite of extreme strength and tanginess.  Overall, this is a good example of the style, but, is at times difficult to swallow.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ngandhi,3.54,Did they run out of all that deliciously rich malt at the brewery or were they just trying to prove something? I feel like I ate a jar of Vicks. Vicks blended with raw hops wrapped in the pith of a grapefruit marinated in a new liquid form of velcro.  Ow.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,wedge,3.92,"I've attempted to review this before and have found it a strangely difficult beer to wrap my head around. I can seem like simplistic hop juice one minute, and be a multi-layered treat another.  Luminescent, hazed peach color with a loosely creamy white head - retains as a sticky sheet. Aromas of sweet, juicy citrus, fruits, flowers, humid herbal and spruce...all things hops. Flavor follows up on the smell - big citrus oil acidity, tropical fruit, and pine sap. Sweetness fights with a deeply resinous quality and lemon rind. Bitterness is big and long lasting.  Not for the weak-tongued. This is a good, powerful DIPA, but something keeps it from being truly great and memorable for me. Something doesn't quite sit right. Its raw, pungent hop style needs a substantial malt profile to balance and this is lacking. Up the malt, and this would be a tough one to beat. And yet, I still have a hard time giving the taste anything below a 4. Peculiar. Right on the brink of greatness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Bobikel,4.67,"(served in a resteraunt - took notes on a napkin)  Appearance - Light golden, good head - nice lacing  Smell - Spicy pine and citrus notes behind a slight sweet malt  Taste - Earthy, spicy, grapefruit, extra dry and bitter. Gave me chills.  Mouthfeel - Thick & effervescently pleasent. A bit to thick for an IPA, though.  Drinkability - I could drink this all night.  Overall - I love bitter. I love beer. I LOVE bitter beer!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,pvsob,4.42,"Appearance - Pours a crystal clear gold color with a two-finger head that disappears slowly and leaves outstanding lacing.  Smell - Yowza!! Big-time floral and grapefruit hop aroma. There are some hints of fruit (orange, tangerine, etc...) as well.  Taste - A slight malt sweetness at the beginning, but don't blink because you will miss it. After this hint of malt the rest of the flavor is straight up hops baby. The hops stick around long after the last swallow too. There was little to no alcohol taste noticeable in this brew.  Mouthfeel - Medium and sticky with good carbonation.  Overall - If you're used to a DIPA with more of a malt backbone, I'd look elsewhere. Hop Wallop is a full on assault on your taste buds and it shows no mercy. Beware, because this brew grows on you very quickly and the alcohol may catch up to you. The drinkablilty is only limited by how much hop and alcohol tolerance you have. Well done Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BelgianAleSlut,3.92,"Poured into a Goose Island IPA glass. Pours golden with a slight foam head. Nice looking although I was expecting a darker color based on alcohol content.  Smells of hops, of course, with a slight grapefruit juice note.  Bitterness hits the tongue immediately and hop flavor changes a bit from sip to swallow. Pushes the limit of acrid. Not much malt flavor here.  I am a hophead and love the smell of hops, the more dry-hopped the better. This beer is for hop addicts - those that eschew malt for feeling giddy from the chemicals in the hop flowers. I would not consider myself a hop addict and prefer a more balanced beer. Victory does make Hop Devil which is more to my liking.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,assurbanipaul,4.44,"Pours a brilliant clear gold with an inch-thick white head. Aroma is bright, juicy, sweet hops: a ton of grapefruit, white grape, mandarin orange. A sheet of lacing follows down the glass.  Taste is very close to the nose but with a light toasty malt base. Citrus of many varieties, floral notes, light resiny pine, even cantaloupe? Light lemony flavor amid a light bready pale malt. There's no trace of alcohol flavors or presence but you feel the warmth by the end of the glass. Finish is very bitter with some caramel sweetness hidden on the back of the throat.  Mouthfeel is light to medium, not quite thin but with a lager-like body. Drinkability is high, nearly quaffable if not for the hop bitterness. This is a fantastic showcase for the hops -- it is bright and exhuberant. It makes me happy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Blybloke,2.45,"Did you ever have to chew an aspirin as a kid? Just wondering...  Pours a pale yellow with less than a finger of white head. Disappointing to say the least. The clarity is nice, but most of the other DIPAs I've tried have a more amber tone to them.  The smell is a somewhat acrid mix of alcohol and citrus - some earthy scents in there too (dirt?). This too was disappointing as I LOVE the nose on most IPAs and DIPAs. Avery's Maharaja, Bell's HopSlam, Tyranena's Hop Whore, DFH 90 Minute and Arcadia's HopMouth all have much more inviting aromas imo.  This stuff tasted like pure aspirin with a thin coating of pineapple. Bitter with little to no balance. Bitter for bitterness sake. I'm a hop lover at heart but this was too much.  Mouthfeel was too thin for the style. Again the pinch of bitterness rears it's head. The carbonation was good though but the overall texture left a lot to be desired.  As far as drinkability, I couldn't have more than one of these at a sitting. It's not a drain pour as there are hints of what makes the style great, but at least for this drinker, there is way too much bitterness to fight through to get to the goods.  Overall a disappointing beer - to each his own I guess. I'll stick to the Hop Devil and Storm King. Victory will still get my business, but I doubt I'll be purchasing this one again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BadBadger,4.3,"Victory's Hop Wallop is a mighty fine and tasty brew. It pours a cloudy golden color. There is a moderate head which does not last very long at all (I assure you that this will not impinge on your enjoyment). The smell is floral-hoppy, as is the taste: there is a nice bitter twang on the tongue with floral side notes. The mouthfeel is smooth and pleasant. This is a very nice IPA which I highly recommend searching out and enjoying!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Westsidethreat,4.03,"A: Vibrant golden rod color. Frankly, looks like a hefe...or perhaps the yolk of an egg. Head is slightly off white and fallen to a small ring.  S: Over the top grapefruit. Huge amounts of lemon rind and hints of white peach.  T: Like the smell lead you to believe, this beer is dominated by the taste of grapefruit; sour, pungent and bitter. Not a lot of malt to use as a backbone, but there is enough so the beer isn't totally off kilt. As the grapefruit subsides, sugary lemondrops develop. Finishes tangy and bitter.  M: Medium body with a hard consistency. I think its fitting though for a beer of this nature.  D: Not the most complex DIPA I've had, but holds enough individuality so that I will actually remember this one. This was an overall nice beer to drink.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,AaronHomoya,4.02,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a very clear, golden-amber color with lots of tiny bubbles rising up the glass. The head is fairly small, though, and white.  Smell is a great, complex mix of sweet, citrus, grapefruit hoppiness, then a touch of malt, then an almost pine smell with what hit me as a kiwi aroma.  The taste follows with a malt and hop sweetness followed by a bit of pine and then a piney, hoppy bitter finish in the back of the mouth. Also a hint of alcohol flavor.  Mouthfeel was very smooth feeling and seemed fairly thin and light for the ABV.  In the end I really enjoyed this beer, but there was something in the combination of bitter mouth finish and maybe the relatively high ABV that made me feel 12 oz was enough.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,goochpunch,3.9,"Updated 11/15/07  Pours out an orange Otter Pop orange with a wealth of bubbles making their way to the creamy but thinnish head. Leaves lot of lace of tiny bubbles. Big time pine and grass in the nose with a modest citrus. Malt is so far in the background that I'm having trouble making any of it out. Malt comes out a bit more in the taste with some sweet apple flavors and a little bit of a jelly-like flavor as well. Hops are a little on the burnt rubber side, which kind of rubs me the wrong way just a tad, but are overall extremely piney and grassy. Tastes like a fresh-cut lawn. Bitterness hits hard in the finish, and leaves an aspirin flavor lingering. Mouthfeel is a bit viscous, but not really all that heavy. Carbonation massages the tongue vigorously, but I wouldn't exactly call it fizzy. Tasty and impressive beer, but I couldn't session this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,allengarvin,4.37,"Pours out a rather limpid pale gold color with a slight head. Nice lacing though. Very nice aroma: all hops, pine-needle-grapefruit smell. Wow, taste is dominated by hop flavor, very spicy (floral, fresh pine... if even makes me think of cumin). Plenty bitter, too. Not very complex: the malt is barely detectable, but boy this is a great beer for the hops. Light bodied, creamy mouthfeel.  Very nice. It doesn't feel like an 8% beer. I could easily put back a few pints of these based on the taste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Head is bright white.  Smell: Lots of resiny hop aroma - dominated by pine with a bit of grapefuit as well.  Taste: Completely hop dominated. The hops blow away any malt flavor in this one. Starts off bitter, but then the hop flavors come in and take over. Again, lots of sticky pine-like flavors, and a bit of citrus. Finishes just as bitter as it started.  Overall impression: Definitely hop dominated - this one is over the top, and in no way balanced. In other words, fantastic if you are hop head!

Flavor is remarkable if you like hops in your face. Plenty of features and true to Victory style...even though it delivers a hefty 8.5 ABV it has a nice drinkability that dosn't stick to your tongue.

And let met add, that I almost always love Victory's products. But this one is a major disappointment. The best thing about this brew is the bottle appearance (the cute little label) and the slightly cloudy golden appearance as it is poured. It's fizzy, but virtually no head retention. This is all hops. While I didn't expect balance, I did not expect a total lack of malt.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Very bitter with the piney bitterness coming through the strongest. Unlike most extremely hoppy beers there didn't seem to be a great deal of aftertaste.

Only poured a half finger head that faded to a cap. The color makes up for the lack of head.  The smell is filled with layer upon layer of hoppiness. There is a vague sweet maltiness in the background but the hops are all over the place. Theres a bubblegum scent I love followed by honeydew, floral and herbal hops. This is one of the most complex hop aromas I've smelled. I really dig the smell of this stuff. I had to drink 4 of them before I could figure out what it was.  The taste starts off with the same flavors as in the nose. Theres honeydew, a smll amount of bubblegum, and this is all followed by a very solid herbal bitterness in the finish. There's a malt backbone that keeps the hops from running wild but it stays where it should, in the back. This is artfully layered in hoppy bitterness.  It has a solid medium body, which is a nice change of pace from a lot of IIPAs that are syrupy. Moderate carbonation. Does give the tongue a stomping on. Very nicely done.  Drinkability is good. This goes down smooth and easy. Could definately drink these till I couldn't drink anymore if that makes sense.  Hop Wallop really impresses me from the cool little origin on the bottle to the last tongue kicking drop. I like the fact they sell these in 6-packs too considering a lot of IIPAs only come in bombers now a days.

The body is a musty yellow, orange with blonde highlights. The sent is familiar, yet odd, lots of fresh citrus( grapefruit, lemon, orange peal, lots or rinds) and hop funk a little more sharp and thin then Id prefer, but still pleasing. The malt is present and helpful, but something seems a shade unbalanced or off to me, its possible the hop choice is not quite what Id want. As it worms up it even has wine like smells or Welchs grape juice. The taste is fresh with definite hop bitterness a shade too unbalanced for me, but still very refreshing and tasty. It could also possibly be that the malt is not up too the same task that I look for in my Imp. IPA. Im even thinking they might have used some pilsner malt, Im not sure but something is very different from my other experiences with Imp. IPA. The mouth feel like I said is refreshing and bitter. Honestly for me this is an a-typical Imp. IPA, for me this is more a summer drink. Its worth a try, but be warned.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,MaltyGoodness,4.4,"12oz. bottle - 2006 Edition  Pours a clear golden color with a thick white head that thins. Thick lacing on the glass.  Aroma is an olfactory delight full of citrusy hops. Smells like layers upon layers of a fantastic citrus hop blend, with just the slightest hint of malt in the background.  Rich citrus hop flavor, with a variety of hops that are well blended with a nice bitter bite. There is a tiny bit of malt flavor present, just enough to hold back the bitterness and add a slight amount of balance. Finishes dry with a lingering hoppiness.  Full body, solid carbonation.  Another good year for the Wallop. The ABV is the only thing that holds this one back from drinking more than one or 2 at a time. This year seems to be just a bit better than last, and can hold it's own with any DIPA in the country.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Gasp100,3.98,"Forgive me, i'm writing this on my handheld. A - incredibly clear pale golden color. Looks no darker than Miller or Bud but we all know there is a universe of difference once we taste this... still, as a new all grain homebrewer I'm amazed at the clarity. S - sharp and distinct piney, resinous, citrus, lemony hop scents abound. T - lip smacking tart hop bitterness slowly glides across the palette. This is very bitter with grapefruit, orange peel rinds, lemon, lime and little if any malt body or caramel sweetness to coincide. But, i like it - definitely not as cloying as say Stone 10th IPA but I wish this had just a little more body to it. M - highly carbed assault with tight, strict, even lacing with makes this brew really pop. D - The alcohol is well hidden, but the sharpness and heavy twang from the hops keep this from ever being sessionable... which is good because it's a DIPA afterall. Someone posted they had Wallop every year including 03 - I think they stuck one extra year in there, but needless to say this is not close to the very first release. But, it's pretty damn good and well worth the money for a seasonal. Maybe I'll cellar some this year.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Wren,4.15,"12 oz bottle that is probably about 3 weeks old - served in a standard pint glass  Appearance was pale and bight golden/straw yellow, not the orange amber I was expecting for an 8.5 beer Fantastic head of course, foamed up two inches, bright white, lasted 3/4 of the glass and contibuters the most to this beer having a great appearance, carbonation slightly heavy which works well with the hops and ABV  The smell was complex - some grapefruit, piney/lemon aromas, but also notes of spicey noble hop character difficult to pin down hop variety from the nose, but the smell alone invites you to take a long slow sip  Taste started out as a nice balance between citrius hop and light malt character wtih a note of alcholo tying them together thin mouthfeel then gives way to growing hop flavour and big bitter bite that lasts long after your last sip  It took me 1 hour to drain my glass - the big bitter character in the finish of this beer had me taking small sip and enjoying bitter aftertaste, definetly not a session beer for me, but certainly worth a try",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,strangefate,4.4,"(Almost brand new bottle, Oct 06, dated ""Enjoy by Oct 23 07"")  Hop explosion. Wow. I was surprised how light the color of this beer was when I poured it. It's a very transparent golden blonde that doesn't look like any other IPA I've seen. Looking at it from the top down after drinking a bit of it, it kind of looks something like a Witbier. I do wish the head retention was a little better, and that the head was a little thicker, but it does leave a nice lacing. There's no question upon smelling this that it's a Double IPA, and the plethora of hops make this a very strong fruity smell.  When this first hit my tongue, I was surprised. Yeah, the name is Hop Wallop, but wow is it a wallop. It's a great surprise though, and it's something that you want to keep drinking because of it -- kind of a ""wow is that hoppy, let me taste it again"" kind of thing. And before you know it half the beer is gone. It has citrusy undertones with a seriously bitter, piney bite. You can feel this hoppiness all over your tongue, and it's great.  It's kind of a high alcohol content, but you're easy to get lost in the complexity of the taste without realizing it. You can probably put away a few of these.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,nicefix,3.79,Pours a super clear straw color with a nice white head. Good head retension with wicked sticky lace. Smells of very fragrant hops. Pineapple fruit with some malt. Taste is very strong in the hops. I get some malt but it's just beat down by the hops. The bitterness is huge. Your palate will be hurting for some time.  I wouldn't say it's entirely drinkable but certainly a unique beer. This is a strong brew in flavor and in ABV. I would like to try it on tap as well.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,akahn,3.62,"Pours a surprisingly pale golden color, slightly hazed. Head recedes to a sticky skim.  Inviting aroma, bristly, assertive hops on the piney side. No malt sweetness or boozy alcohol here.  Flavor is complexly bitter. Initially a piney sharp sensation, giving way to almost a sour flavor. I'm glad this isn't a very sweet DIPA, I appreciate its dryness, but I feel this lacks a backbone to hold it together.  Medium body, but the strictness of the hops leaves a 'thin' impression. If you like your DIPAs straight up hoppy, this is for you. I like mine with more balance, but I appreciate the creativity of this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,DrJay,4.08,"Crystal clear gold with a thin cap of fine, white head. Fairly solid lacing with decent retention, even after settling to a thin skim of bubbles. Pungent grapefruit aroma, pine resin, juicy, and kind of catty. Mild maltiness peeks through, but is basically overwhelmed by the hops. Sharp bitterness to start, but this fades quickly to let biscuity malt sweetness to come forward. Hop flavour is still grapefruit, but not as catty as in the aroma. There's a hint of alcohol warmth in the finish that accompanies an intense, lingering, piney bitterness. Medium bodied, well attenuated, moderate carbonation. Solid texture overall, with a little dryness. Pretty good. I really liked the flavour, but the aroma put me off a bit at first. I warmed up to it by the end of the glass though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Doomcifer,3.23,"Liquor store was just unloading their first shipment of the year of fresh Hop Wallop. I have been waiting for it since I enjoyed last year's offering a lot.  Pours a crystal-clear pale golden color with a decent creamy head that sticks around and leaves great, chunky lacing behind on the glass.  Aroma is HUGE on piney hops! Some citrusy notes are picked up as well, other than that not much, maybe a tad bit of malt peaking through. Hops completely dominate.  Taste is just...Holy Frickin' HOPS! Immense piney, aspirin-y, resiny hops all over the place. Total domination of the hops here. Very crisp. Ridiculously unbalanced. Reminds me of Ruination how it is completely offensive and cripples the palate. The malt really doesn't stick up for itself in this beer match. It has a short showing immediately up front but then is totally crushed by the hops. I guess that's why it's called Hop Wallop.  Mouthfeel is a bit watery but seems to round out a bit when it warms a tad, well carbonated.  Drinkable? Not really. It's just too unbalanced in my opinion. It is a really offensive beer. I am a huge hophead and even this is a bit much. A good beer to embelish in the hops once in a while and most certainly should be your last drink of the night due to it's absolute palate crushing capabilities. I probably wont be tasting right for the next 48 hours. I tend to wonder how this beer would be after sitting for a few months, as I had enjoyed last years. Or maybe this years recipe is tweaked with even MORE hops? Or maybe I just have amnesia and don't remember it being this unbalanced and offensive.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,AzAleC,3.98,"A: A lovely golden color, honey like in a tulip. Moderate carbonation, approx. 1/2"" head which quickly diminished without lacing.  S: A bold hop aroma, very full, crisp and bright with fruity and floral tones.  T: A strong hop nature, with earthy tones. Very well balanced to the malt, significantly impressive based on the alcohol content of the brew.  M: Creamy, the fresh hop oils cling to the mouth and leave wonderful flavors behind.  D: Extremely refreshing for a beer of a higher ABV, definitely something to try again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,yelterdow,4,"12 oz. bottle, been in the fridge for over a year. Best by May 22 '05, this baby right here is going on seventeen months past due, like a really bad library fine... let's see what this beer has to offer.  Appearance- Pours a rugged, burnished orange supporting a soap-sudsy ivory crown... at two fingers, the head pops and hisses its way gently downward, leaving behind massive translucent drapery. Millions of tiny, pin-head sized particles hover in suspension.  Smell- Sweet, sticky, resinous hops forge ahead... even after being straitjacketed in the bottle for a year and a half. A mature, deep malt backbone rides alongside the hops and imparts a very nice balance.  Taste- An inordinate amount of hops are bequeathed and mingle deliciously with a gigantic malt profile... the two sides behaving like siblings at a church picnic. While one is constantly saying, ""I can be louder! I can be bigger!"", they somehow complement each other's egos and work towards being cooperative. The swallow commands full attention... it absolutely wrecks the palate (a.k.a. Stone Ruination) and creates some of the most aggressive hop burps I can remember.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Watery initially, the beer quickly stabilizes and swells very gently into a slick, medium bodied brew. It remains that way in the mouth and it finishes easily, with finesse. This cellared well for the relatively long haul, but I will be at this again while the hops are still green next time...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ByTor2112,3.78,"This beer was given to me by Stu in Bensalem, PA so cheers to Stu.Spicy hop aroma almost Pilsner-esque, don't be fooled! A fluffy golden hued foam slowly fades to some clumps in a nice white film. Great lacing like a thin soapy film all the way down the glass. First sip was WHOA! A small tease of malt is immediately obiterated by an explosion of hop flavor characterisitcs. Asrtingent, floral, piney and a hint of citrus at first. A good froth elicits a nice buttery sweetness, caramel maybe? As this ale warmed up the citurs flavors emerged and it sweetened up a bit. When colder it packs a true zesty wallop. Very intense and I am always impressed with Victory's offerings.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Is that grapefruit?  T: Holy crap. Very powerful pine/hop flavor. The name for this concoction is perfect. Reminds me of cannibas resin.  M: Not overly thick but does leave a powerful tasting coat on the tongue  D: Not my favorite style but it can grow on me. I could easily drink about 3 in one sitting. Pretty drinkable after the initial shock. (I've never had a beer like this before DIPA)  Overall, a unique beer, for me, that intrigues me enough to seek out other DIPA's and compare the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Pronounced but not super strong. Certainly pleasant.  T - I didn't love it. Somewhat hoppy but not particularly interesting. Was not ""walloped"" with hops. Tastes almost like a hoppier wheat beer. All the flavor is on the back of the tongue, with a somewhat bitter aftertaste.  M - Somewhat heavy on the tongue, but thin within the mouth. Not particularly good or bad.  D - One is no problem, but wouldn't want more than that. Overall a slightly above average offering from Victory. Probably worth a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,Pegasus,4.03,"Appearance: Quite hazy medium golden color, similar to egg yolk, with a huge white head, which retains superbly, and thick glass-ringing broken lace.  Aroma: Dense notes of pine tar and grapefruit overwhelm the malt, the aroma is quite similar to grapefruit juice, no malt presence could be found.  Taste: Opens with lightly sweet malt, soon followed by a hop onslaught of pine tar, grapefruit, and orange. Finishes with a lingering metallic and medicinal bitterness.  Mouth feel: Smooth, rich, and remarkably full, with sharp champagne-like carbonation.  Drinkability/notes: A very well made double IPA, perhaps excessive for any but the most devoted hop enthusiast, but manifest in its quality.  Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck, served in a standard pint tap glass.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BillyB,4,"Victory always hides there alcohol brilliantly. This 8.5% hopmonster is so smooth and drinkable.  Pours a Deep golden hue with ruby highlights when held to the light.  Aromas of pine, citrus, grass and all around floral hops. Absolutely no hint of alcohol in the aroma.  Taste is smooth, malt/hop balance(definitely leaning toward the hops but still a balance when the style is a double ipa).  Excellent IPA from what I beleive is the best brewery in America.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Schooly,3.8,"Pours a clear golden with an inch of head in my Victory pilsner glass. Lacing coats the sides as I slurp this one down.  Smells of piney hops with a bit of sweet floral essence.  A nice hoppy beginning with bit of bitterness toward the end and finishes rather bitter with a slight metallic taste and something I can't quite put my finger on, but is present in many of Victory's brews.  Hops coat the mouth and remain there a to tingle and burn the hops into my palate. Not too oily and slick, a rather clean finish.  Drinkability is decent given the relatively clean finish and alcohol presence is scarcely detected. Good stuff",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Domingo,4,"I can only grab the east coast brews a few times a year, so I went for one for this one after trying and loving Hop Devil. Pours a relatively light golden color, and is a little cloudy, due to what I'd guess is a ton of hop oil. The head laces the glass like few I've seen. Reminds me a of a ton of whipped cream. Smell is predicatbaly hoppy, but with a sweeter veriety than I expected. There's some malty grain in there to keep it from being overkill, though. Flavor is initially sweet, but then the hops hit you. It stars out a little piney, the moves to tropical, and then finishes a little floral. The aftertaste is a bitter bite that lets you know this is a DOUBLE IPA and not just a normal one. For an 8+% brew this goes down easy. You know it's got some kick, but it wouldn't prevent you from having another. In a lot of ways this is kind of like Hop Devil's more powerful, but slightly ""simpler"" older brother. It's a wonderful beer, the balance from HopDevil isn't quite completely there. On the other hand the hop power from this beer is up there with huge beers like Ruination and Devil Dancer. It's a great DIPA, which isn't necessarily my favorite style, but an occasional indulgence. This is one of the better ones' I've had, too. Hopefully once Victory finally makes it to Colorado I can get more of it!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,brewcrew76,4.2,A - Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thin white head and tight little bubbles clinging to the glass. This is definitely different from the hazy orange DIPA's I am used to.  S - This one is pure grapefruit. Maybe hints of bubblegum and citrus with a tocuh of sweetness.  T - Grapefruit with more grapefruit on top. Some sweetness in there to balance it but definitely strong on the grapefruity hops.  M - Oily and well carbonated which makes it feel medium bodied. Dry/bittering finish making me crave another sip.  D - This is definitely a hop lovers dream for those that prefer the grapefruity hops. A very nice DIPA.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

T- Oranges and dry hops dominate. Oh yeah, and hops, piney hops. M- Very tart dry finish. A little oily. Quite heavy and full, acceptable for the style.

Definitely worth checking out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,IntriqKen,4.55,"A very different DIPA. Pours a cloudy orange/yellow with a nice full finger white head that melts slowly to thick lacing. Aroma is slightly citrus...lemony....slightly piney....with green hops and light alcohol. Taste is a brilliant balance of sweet malt and citrus ...almost lemon meringue type of hop bitterness. Sweet, yet balanced. Every time the malt sweetness starts to kick in, the lemon hops bury it. Amazing. Mouthfeel is full...alcohol doesn't seem present yet I know it is. Aftertaste is drying...nothing sticky or cloying at all. Hey...wonderful...what can I say? I'd almost given up on DIPA's due to the excessive sweetness they seem to possess...this one is just balanced.

345,14916,JayQue,4.2,"Good beer for a hop head! Pours a cloudy golden color, like a hefeweizen but without the big head. The head is white, medium size and lasts a long time. Smell is of hops and some citrus. Taste is great, bitter hops and smooth with some grapefruit. The mouthfeel is nice and rich. Citrus and hops flavor consistent throughout. Drinkability is good. This is a sipping beer and the abv limits it as a session beer. Two of these would be sufficient (you would definitely take the second one if offered).

345,14916,Toddv29424,4.12,"This beer pours a hazy yellow color with a tiny head, but has little clusters of bubbles that often happens with hoppy beers. The smell is sweet, the hops aren't too over powering and there is a hint of spice to it. The taste is big. A little cluttered in the first sip, with alcohol being the most potent taste. Much more carbonation than I expected, especially to a big fan of Victory's Hop Devil. Its hard to get a handle on the hops, as they balance out nicely with the spice. The absence of any one substantial taste makes this a very drinkable beer, and makes the mouthfeel pleasant.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Fragrantly intoxicating aroma of liberal hops. The abundant pine, fruit, and full sweet malts all blend together perfectly to create seamless awesome. Tastes very balanced yet very hoppy with perfect bitterness. Taste equals the aroma in its wonderful hoppiness with added benfit of a great mouthfeel.

Low carbonation. Floral and grass scents. Harsh and musty hops, earthy notes with faint mushroom. The taste is surprisingly well balanced. Sweet almost apricot and orange flavors alongside harsh and powerful hops. Aftertaste is a long lingering pure hop experience that just wont quit.

This is my first Victory beer, which I guess is tardy for someone within a two hundred mile radius of the brewery. I like the story and the bearded dude on the label.  Color is a bright neon golden yellow with almost no headand a cloudy, opaque body. Nose blasts with hops and a fruity, refreshing tint.  A bitter hop grenade in your mouth that explodes a few seconds after the sip commences. Clean finish but slightly overcarbonated mouthfeel. Dry and refreshing on a summer day. Also hides the alcohol very well. A bit strong for constant consumption but a few will do ya..",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Vancer,4.25,"Welp, I knew that since I luved HopDevil, the Hop Wallop would also be a good one. I wasnt disappointed  an apricot/melon/yellow pour greeted me, along with a sexy lacey white head.  Just enticing strong hops in the aroma, then notes of hops, lemon, citrus in the quaff. Very earthy and leathery. Nice.  A very oily brew, sharp and crisp. A very good sipper brew, even in the STL summer heat. People in the N.E. coast area are lucky bastards, indeed.  thanks to beerbeing!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,RedChrome,3.9,"Poured very nice, very light gold color with a slightly murky appearance. Large cream colored thick head with a long retention. Plenty of carbonation bubbles can be noted through the entire beer.  Aroma packed the very hops punch promised by the label. Despite the amount of hops noted in the odor, I also could detect a vague light citrus aroma that was a nice balance.  Wow. The first sip was a fantastic blend of hops with a nice flavor that mixed the bitterness with the citrus flavors that I noted in the aroma. If you like hops, this is defintly a winner.  I didn't like the overall feel in my mouth as much as I thought I would. It felt a little watery to me, as well as not having as much carbonation as I thought I would note based upon the appearance.  Overall, am exceptionally well crafted beer if you are looking for something with a little bit more hops bite. The other notes of citrus are a perfect balance. I could see myself enjoying this with a nice plate of pasta with garden vegtables. A good compliment to a light fare dinner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Zorro,4.2,"Pours a cloudy gold color with a fine tall white head.  Smell is sweet and malt and even a bit like candy. All that sweetness does not hide the hop load in this beer. Strong and a bit raw hop aroma here, strong pine and grapefruit scents with a harsh hint of eucalyptus. Bit of pineapple and mint in the scent too.  Taste is sweet but that is quickly stamped out by the hops in this brew. Grapefruit and Pineapple are the first major flavors mostly tropical fruit with a bit of mango/peach flavor. Tasty with lots of finer flavors the malt here is just to heavy to let them come out to the same extent that Pliny The Younger and Dreadnaught do. Having said that no way that I am not finishing this beer!  Mouthfeel is good, lighter than it tastes.  A great attempt at the Mega IPA and if Russian River and Three Floyds didn't exist it might be among the best, but this is 2006 and they do. A good DIPA and a great deal cheaper than Dreadnaught, I suggest you buy some of this for the weekends and splurge on Russian River or Three Floyds for Holidays.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,VoodooBrew,4,"Pours light gold with lots of lacings... real clear. Sweet hops and evergreen feature on the nose, with hints of marijuana even. Aromas lie somewhere between lush and rustic. On the palate, an instant sweetness appears but then a big, palate-gripping bitterness takes up residence through a long bitter finish. This is a fairly single-minded beer, not terribly complex, and it's not the crispest, sharpest DIPA out there. It's certainly solid, but -- and maybe I'm spoiled -- there are plenty better ones out there (see Hercules, 90 Minute, Ruination).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,plaid75,4.12,"Poured a light and hazy copper hue with a one finger foamy head. Suprisingly light in color for a DIPA. There was good retention and excellent sticky lacing.  The smell was very much dominated by a grapefruit hop aroma and a bit of a cannabis scent. Suprisingly there was a noticable malt presence.  The taste was very dry and very citrusy grapefruit. Again some malt body detected, but the hops really overwhelmed the flavor.  The mouthfeel was full and dry. The high hop profile left a nice tingling sensation.  Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable DIPA. The ABV was nicely hidden by the abundant hop flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BeerRun13,3.24,"Pours a slightly cloudy pale golden color. A thick white head fizzles out, but still leaves GREAT lace. Kind of a sweet earthy aroma. I don't know quite what it is but something smells a little akward. A malty backbone and an ambush of different hops. Somehow it balances itself out. It's kind of a strange but, ok flavor. I'd love to know the hop profile on this beer. Light to medium bodied. Moderately carbonated. A creamy mouthfeel balances nicely with the hops on the palate. Is an okay brew that I'd sure like to try again, but in the meantime there was just something akward about the taste and aroma that I couldn't quite pinpoint.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,edskirk3,4.48,"I love the label on this bottle. The jolly old prospector looks like a Popeye character. And ""wallop"" is one of my favorite words to use....  Freshness? ""Enjoy by Nov 09 06""  Pours a cloudy shade of peach, with a sticky, thick head of white. I don't even have to tell you what it smells like, do I?  The taste is what surprises me most: I don't just taste hops. It's an almost perfect balance of hoppiness and maltiness. I noticed it was especially viscous during the pour. There's an iota of sticky sweetness in there, which I appreciate. And it's not too carbonated, which adds to the drinkability.  I do not consider myself a hophead, and I am very pleased to say the least. Good show, Victory!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,TurdFurgison,4.13,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Stone IPA glass. Hazy golden yellow appearance with sticky 1-finger foam.  I have a hard time comparing some of the IPAs or DIPAs because most of the smell and taste is hops. This one is world class, very similar to Stone IPA or Alesmith IPA in aroma, flavor, and texture.  It's very good but Stone is cheaper. So Stone's my pick.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,copasetic,4.76,"An aggressive pour of this crystal clear golden beer yielded an inch tall frothy head that quickly diminished. The smell is rich, resiny, and very raw and hoppy. It's almost like I imagine a beer would smell if I dry hopped it right before I drank it. The taste is amazing! Very bitter, but balanced between the maltiness and the sweet piney flavors and aromas of hops. It's a tongue-coater for sure --heavy, oily, and chewy.  A keeper. Those who aren't overly enthusiastic about hops need not apply. And yes, despite its strong flavors, I could drink several of these on a warm spring evening, at least until my tongue went numb.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jhammerly,4.08,"Thanks to bkett01 for the trade.  Poured into an Imperial Pint. Has the appearance of a hefeweizen - light, golden, and somewhat hazy. An off-white head sits on top at about 1 1/2 inches. Keeps its composure for awhile. A gentle citrusy hop aroma. The taste of grapefruit comes to mind first - bitter, but rounded out by the malt. Very drinkable despite the high ABV and rather thin - not in a bad way though. I would definitely try this one again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Nice tight head.  Smells like sour hops, with some citrus and pine mixed in.  Taste - extremely bitter hops, with green grassy notes. Some floral and citrus as well, and it feels pretty light for a IIPA. I think tangy is a good word here, but it has some malt behind it - not much, but juuuust enough to take the edge off the hops. Goes down really easy - almost TOO easy. ABV is well hidden.  Feels a bit thin in mouthfeel, but this is a pretty good beer. I wouldnt put it in the same class as Dreadnaught, 90minute, etc, but its a good, lighter DIPA that doesnt get too sweet or sticky once it warms up.  A good DIPA, but not world class.

S: Heavy hops smell with some citrus & malt sweetness and bit of alcohol.  T: Strong, bitter hops bite hits you right away (hence the name) and certainly doesn’t taste as sweet as it smells. It leaves a bitter hops after-taste, but it’s not as strong as you would think.  M: Very crisp and smooth as well, with a medium body, medium carbonation and a clean finish.  D: This is a drinkable beer, especially if you’re into the hops bitterness. The alcohol is hidden pretty well without using sweetness to do it and it's not very filling. It’s just not quite as balanced as I would prefer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Has about an inch of bright white head that leaves nice lacing all the way down my glass. Nose full of hops. Pine with some grapefruit also. Taste just like it smells. Hops hit you in the mouth. Piney for the most part with a bitter citrusy finish. Very smooth and almost full bodied for such a light colored brew.

345,14916,ghostwalker,3.65,"12 oz bottle serving. Enjoy by Oct 11 06.  Color is light for a DIPA, straw yellow to light amber. Solid 2 fingers of intensely foamed head. Monster lace.  Nose is spicy citrus. I'm not sure what it is, but there is a very unusual and distinct dominant trait here. I can't identify it.  Flavor is hops and more hops. What has me scratching my head is what KIND of hops. It's certainly not the usual citrus or piney suspects. Unusual and unique, that is for sure. Malt is present in a good way, but not quite enough to balance out the hops. What else can you expect from a brew called Hop Wallop?  Mouthfeel is slightly thick and even a little syrupy. Moderate to high carbonation.  Drinkability is OK. I bought a sixer of these last fall at release. This is the last one, if that means anything to you.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,santanas95,4.9,"The first time I had this, I didn't really care for it... and I still drank the full sixer. That should tell you a bit (either about the beer, or my unwillingness to give away beer I don't like). That being said, I decided to be a bit more objective. I love this style, and wanted to give this beer a fair shake. After all, how many bad beers have you ever heard of coming from Victory? Poured a nice clear honey color into my pint glass. Nice 1 inch head that quickly disappeared, but left a good sticky lacing down the side of my glass. The six-pak holder claims this to be ""A very hoppy beer"" with contents of ""hops, hops, and more hops"". One sniff into my glass, and the miner guy was smacking my in the face saying ""I told you sonny!"" Very hoppy beer... no shite. I got nothing but hops from the aroma. Let's try tasting this again... high puckering bitterness and hop flavor. Almost like drinking diluted grapefruit juice. Slightly piney (actually more like spruce). The first time I tried this was like drinking spruce sap (and I have). Luckily, this time that taste was not present so much. I enjoy a good hop-alicious beer every now and then. I wish this were a year round offering. I wondered if they used any malts at all, then midglass, the hops settled down, and I got a little malt and pseudo honey backdrop to the hop craziness. Does the label really say 8.5% ABV?, because I can't taste it at all. Carbonation was perhaps a bit understated. I found no alcohol in either the flavor or mouthfeel. That's dangerous for this beer, especially if you enjoy an in your face hop bomb such as this. Must... force... myself... not... to... drink... entire... six... pack...at... once. The only thing I could recommend to a hophead that would be close it to actually chew on an ounce of hops... like Chinook .",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Oxymoron,3.85,Old miner guy = wallop? I don't get it. Pours out a sandy blond. Hazy with good foam at the pour but quickly hides to the side of the glass. Good lacing.  The smell is grainy with stronger notes of pilsner and basic malt notes. A very sweet grain feeling. Good piney and citrus aromas that are well present. A nice non-phenolic smell or big beer essence.  The taste is sweet and high bitterness. The malt to is sweet with a grainy taste and play second to the hops. The malt overall doesn't really support the hop flavor too much. The hops are big up front with a tart and piney hop flavor. A tangerine with more of a bite. There isn't much of a finish per the hops side.  Overall this isn't a big flavor for a IIPA but still easy to drink. A smooth and somewhat dry finish. Decent carbonation and very easy on the palate. I suppose that even old miners need something to drink.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,kkipple,3.98,"I love Victory's beers and I love hops, so when I saw their ""Hop Wallop"" sitting at my favorite beer shop (Brawley's in Charlotte) it was pretty much an assured purchase.  Hop Wallop is beautiful bubbly golden nectar with a fluffy cream head. The head lingers a long while, and leaves some mad lacing down the sides of my glass. Awesome.  Put your nose to the glass and you're assaulted with hops. Hops hops hoppity hop hops. Fresh, piney, sweet, grapefruit smelling hops! Did you expect anything else? The Victory website says Wallop is made with ""American whole flower"" hops which isn't very enlightening. Pity, I'm curious to know what's in here.  Taste is what you'd expect - hops and lots of 'em! In fact there's very little else discernible in this beer APART from hops. Perhaps some yeast and honey flavor... but mostly the piney, bitter, oily hop goodness. The 8.5% is quite hidden behind the cascade of hop flavor. This is a rather bitter beer, so be warned. Put simply, ""Wallop"" is a most appropriate name  Hop Wallop warms the tongue and stomach and leaves behind a fine dry hop bitterness as it slides down your gullet. Just really tasty stuff -- if you like hops.  I personally enjoyed this beer, but it's almost too much. Not the type of thing I'd drink on a regular basis, and certainly not a session beer for me. If you, like I, have times when you get a craving for hops, this certainly satisfies.

No hint of malt , but then, none was really expected from this. Taste- a big, big, wonderfully bitter hop bite of pine and citrus (grapefruit) !!

Leaves a wonderfully symetrical lacing in the glass The attn. is brilliant, pouring a deep golden straw which seemed a bit light for the style, but the lighting here is a too flourescent. The nose on this brew is incredible. The hops give off a perfumey aroma of apricot, pear, spiced apple, and some herbal tone as well. All this is backed by hints of buscuity and sweet malts. The mouth is highly supportive. A moderate carbonation structure carries the bitters over every segment of the mouth. At first a swett light honey and malty tast then BIG bitters from teh hops.

Almost a little citrusy also. Some sweet candy smelling maltiness in the back. The smell is not over the top but borederline. I could really smell the hops in it.  T - Funny thing is I thought this was an APA before I started drinking. As I drank it knew it was an IPA, especially after I looked at the ABV. As I made it 1/2 way through the glass I was thinking this was on ultra hopped IPA. Not over the top hops as Stone Ruination but it's got a good kick. I had IPA in my head the entire time so it didn't seem to overly bitter for my tastes as DIPA's generally are. But don't get me wrong - it's bitter. I was just thinking this must be on the high end of an IPA.  M - Smooth up front with moderate carbonation. A slightly tart and very crisp finish from all the hops. Dry at the end but still good.  D - Not bad for a DIPA. May not satisfy the ultra hop heads out there (I've never considered myself a HOP head) but it's got enough bite to satisfy most everyone else looking to try a DIPA.

Oh man, the malt isn't even on the radar with this baby. Truly an unbalanced beer, but I was looking for crazy hops and boy did it deliver.

Noble hops if I had to guess. Grassy/earthy/and a bit like a pilsner. Tastes very hoppy over the top. Somehow I pick up spearmint above everything else. Weird. The earthy hop smell comes across as an initial taste that is overcome by the minty/menthol like flavor. The hops aren't so bitter to kill me, but I do like bitter beer. Just a one trick pony with this weird mint thing going on. A very thick beer. If it wasn't for this minty thing driving me crazy it might be better, but not terribly impressed here.  *note: the minty flavor decreases as the beer warms up.

Clears as it warms. Bright, bright white head stays around around the whole way, a full pillow of little bubbles. Excellent lacing. Looks a lot more like a wheat beer or wit than an IPA. Pilsner malt?  S - assertive hop aroma of pine, citrus, orange peel. Some malt in there as well, though. Toasty, sweet malt. Alcohol in the nose as well.

One of these just totally wrecked my palate. No more reviewing tonight; but it was an enjoyable wreckage. I just don't need another one. Well, heres the breakdown:  I let this one warm up fro a while before opening to maximize the smoothness. Then served it in my snifter glass.  Appearance: A golden orange color this beer is translucent but not transparent. Active carbonation at the beginning but it died mid way through the beer. It had a creamy white head with decent retention and an adequate amount of lacing. the frothy cap did last the duration of the beer. Very nice appearance.  Smell: This beer is very hoppy but it is not cloyingly pine in the smell or taste. I am not a fan of the eating Christmas tree pine flavor. Not to fear this hop character is more citrusy with a bit of grass than it is pine. The aroma to me was like lemon and grapefruit. Very full poignant aroma. Good!  Taste: Again the taste does get a bit green but not overwhelmingly so. It is more of a citrus grapefruit and granny smith apples type of tart. There is a malt backbone that give the beer some more depth but the malt base does get a bit thin approaching the finish the hop character takes over. A lingering tartness makes this a lip-smacking aftertaste. The aftertaste does come back around though to drop off some more sweet. It is evident there was plenty of sugar in this lemonade :) so to speak.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. Mildly carbonated, mostly it was prickly due to the sharp hops the felt like active needles on my tastebuds.  Drinkability: How can I comment. I did finish one. And it was good, but I sure as hell don't want another one. It is a double IPA and you hop heads will love it. There is no way you want to drink it all night (at least not me). I am glad to have had one and one is enough, so I'll give it a 3.0 and hope this explanation makes sense.  Hope this is helpful.

Taste is much like the smell a powerful hop blast with a grapefruit like bite. The 8.5% can not be seen anywhere in the brew even after I let it warm up a bit.  Mouthfeel is rather oily with a even carbonation feel.  Drinkability is well all right. The oily feel is not my thing and the 8.5% snuck up on me like a panhandler asking for change.

Smell - Strong grapefruit/citrus aroma with floral notes, and a slight sweetness for balance.  Mouthfeel - Body is surprisingly thick, with the hop oils making their presence felt.  Taste - Wow! Not surprisingly, the hops dominate the flavor early on. There is a strong and acidic grapefruit flavor, followed by a hit of malt sweetness. The malts play a more prominent role as the beer warms, but never enough to overpower the hop profile. If balanced and DIPA can be said in the same sentence, I would say it for this beer.  Drinkability - Only the bottle label and the glazed look in my eyes reveal the 8.5% ABV. The bold taste dictates this to be a sipping beer even though there is hardly a trace of alcohol flavor even when the beer warms.  Overall - Kudos to Victory!

Screw the malt, no chance with that hop aroma dominance. Taste is also hop dominant. Very citrusy with grapefruit dominant. Some grassy notes come in here and there. There's a bit of a yeasty bready sensation and some sweetness from the malts but its very little. The hops just beat them down, along with my palate. Finish is assertively bitter and quite acidic, or maybe it's just really resiny and spicy, I can't tell. I knew what I was getting into here and I am better for it.

Stoudt's used to be available in LA until recently, and most of the Victory lineup still is, although Hop Wallop isn't. Thanks to BRoss242 for sending me a bottle of this stuff as a part of the Boxing Day BIF.  This is a fairly light color for a 2IPA. Its white head starts out small, but it sticks around until the end of the glass. I smell German malts and spicy hops much like Hop Devil. If my memory serves my correctly, this tastes like a double Hop Devil, which makes sense. It's quite different from the citrusy, piney flavor in West Coast IPA's and the Stoudt's- imagine brewing an Imperial Pilsner as an ale. This is a nice change of pace from the C's.

Malt character seems to be lacking, as it is very pale and completely taken over by the hop flavor and bitterness. Flowery, slightly spicy hop flavor. Finishes sweet. Hop Wallop certainly delivered what it promised on the label, ""A very hoppy ale"". I really would have liked more malt character and a bit more balanced, as this is completely one-sided.

Has a dry hoppy aftertaste that lingers around for a while. Loved every minute of this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,SethB2,3.92,"Served in a Deschutes pint glass out of a bottle  A - not what I would expect from a DIPA. Look like a pale ale. A light golden brown color.  S - some sweet malts, but mostly hops. Pretty much what I would expect  T - For a DIPA, this is just about right. Hoppiness dominates from beginning to end. Floral hops to be sure, but still unique, which is a difficult task. Kudos to Victory on that one.  M - Close to perfect. Very nice. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. Very nice.  D - Takes a hit as many DIPAs do for me. So strong tasting that it would be difficult to hammer back more than a couple at a sitting.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Jacobier10,3.48,"The label for the beer is probably my favorite of any beer. I love the color scheme and the cartoonish picture of Horace ""Hop"" Wallop with his tongue sticking out. Ok enough of that, let's get to the beer...  Pours a bright straw yellow color with a small white head. Small amount of lacing but the beer needs a little swirl to bring back the head. The aroma is all citrus hops. No balance whatsoever, just hops. Same for the flavor. The malt backbone that I crave for a IIPA is missing dearly. The palate is left dry and bitter. The alcohol strength is noticable but not overpowering.  Not a bad beer, just way too one-dimensional and is lacking depth. In my opinion, skip this beer and just enjoy the HopDevil, but it is worth a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,crwills,4.57,"I am not a hophead. I am not a hophead. I am not a hophead, but damn... did this double IPA make me hoppy... err... I mean happy. This is the one I've been looking for, and I'm kicking myself for only buying one when I had the chance.  Pours a cloudy dark golden colour that reminds me of some hefeweizens I've had, with a biiig fluffy head.  Smell is bitter, dry grapefruit, pine, sour berries, and some mint or other herbs that really clear out the sinuses.  Taste is actually almost sweet right up front and then... hop wallop! Extremely dry and bitter, with an equally mouth-puckering aftertaste. A bit fruitier than some other super-hoppy beers I've had, which I find gives it more depth and makes it more enjoyable. Mainly citrus, but some sour cherry flavour in there too. Also, a hint of the piney-ness from the smell, plus some soap. I tend to get soapy impressions from most hoppy beers, though, so read nothing into it.  Dropped the drinkability a bit just because it's SO bitter, but it's an awesome beer, and great by itself to refresh your palette or with spicy or greasy food.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Metalmonk,4.29,"Super-soapy head looks unusual atop a regular pilsner-ish pale gold/yellow color. Carbonation is extremely low-key.  I almost got high from just smelling this one. It's a rush. Like drowning to death in a sea of liquidfied hops. (I could think of worse ways to go...) The aroma is transcendent. The grapefruit element is strong and welcome. It's almost nothing but hops, hops and more hops, but this is supposed to be a seriously hoppy beer, so why not? Unfortunately the build-up from the smell doesn't totally carry through with the taste. There is indeed all kinds of hoppiness in the flavor, but there's really nothing else going on. It could be any number of other super-hopped ales. It's got nothing on Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA, for example. But still, there's no doubting its great qualities, and since I tend to like extreme hops anyway, I can't help but savor it. The bitterness remains intense and satisfying, and it might impair its drinkability for some, but me? I'll have another.  Mouthfeel gives a nice creaminess for such a sharply-flavored beer, feels great in and all the way down. I would definitely love a few of these on a hot summer day, but at 8.5 percent it could be a wipeout.  I don't feel like Victory is the ultimate U.S. microbrewer, as a couple of my friends might, but they're always consistently good and different in some way. This is no exception, but I would've liked some extra depth in the flavor to put it into the league of legends.  [Note: Had a couple years later on tap, and the flavor profile was greatly expanded. An excellent beer.]",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,rodrot,3.97,"This beer poured a slightly hazy, golden color with a tiny white head. The appearance was totally unexpected, being that every other DIPA I'd tried was quite a bit darker. The aroma was hop heaven for me- very herbal, perfumy and citrusy. It reminded me of cutting up a grapefruit. The taste was incredibly unusual, with a mouth puckering blast of hops assaulting my taste buds along with a touch of alcoholic warmth. As the beer warmed, I was able to detect a good malt presence. Despite the strength, I found this brew to be a great thirstquencher and it would probably make a great Summer beer. This beer is hard to categorize. Is it really a DIPA or is it just a strong, hoppy Golden ale? Whatever, I love it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ALESwhatCURESya,3.19,"A-Bright hazy golden color with a decently impressive foamy head. The color is very brilliant, much like Golden Monkey.  S-Now don't get me wrong, I love hops to death, but this one was so pungent that it reminded me of a barnyard. The heavy, resinous, piney, and citrusy hop profile was just a punch in the face (normally something I love).  T&M-The Full-bodied flavor is decently balanced between the huge hop presence and maltiness. A citrus kick (i.e. Grapefruit) is a welcoming flavor. The bitterness clings to the tongue with a vengence. If you want ultra-fresh hoppiness, this should cover your cravings.  D-Although not my favorite double IPA, it is still very nicely crafted. At 8.5% this one hits pretty hard so if I went more than two pints, I could find myself in drunken hell with gasoline boots on!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Mitchster,3.87,"Paid $2.40 for a 12oz bottle. 8.5% ABV.  Pours out to a very clear medium golden with orange accents, forming a modest off-white soapy head with very good retention and lacing. Carbonation is moderate. The aroma is pungent and spicy with hops in the boatload....pine, resinous skunkweed, flowers, grapefruit, lemon...it's all there. Reminds me of Stone IPA in a way. The mouthfeel is pungent, sharp and crisp with a dry finish and medium-light body. In no way does this feel like a beer with 8.5% ABV. The taste is much the same with a pungent bitterness, like sucking on grapefruit rind and pinesap. Lightly grassy with very astringent alcohol presence. There is a little bit of grain and chalk in the finish.  This is a good IPA, but it's too bitter for my tastes. I'll stick with Founder's Centennial, Stone IPA, and Bell's Two-Hearted. IMO, Hop Devil is much more drinkable than this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,kelticblood,2.61,Poured out a hazy straw yellow color almost like a wheat beer. Has nice thin bands of lacing with each sip. Other than that no real head is present. Aroma has almost a cheap skunk Budweiser type smell. First sip is pure bitterness! Overpowering bitterness that I doubt few will like unless your really into heavily hopped and real bitter beers. The bitterness hides any kind of malt or hop flavor. It is too much for me to enjoy this beer. Crisp mouthfeel and a medium body. Not highly drinkable. The high ABV is well hidden however.

345,14916,HardTarget,3.72,"Bottle Inspection: 8.5% abv., enjoy by 09 06 (sampled 02 06)  Aroma: WOW! Thats hoppy. Thats a big load of grapefruit rind, orange pith, passion fruit, with a lemon twist. Deep in there is a hint of grassy, but no malt to be found.  Appearance: Very hazy peach/yellow glass sports a respectable white cover that laced in thick curtains.  Flavor: Someone dumped a pine basket of pineapple, grapefruit, and alpha acid in my mouth. Bitterness grows to the point of pain but backs off last second to just sit there and leave chemical burns. Finish should last until next Tuesday. Just silly hoppy  Mouthfeel: A bit caustic, oily, medium body with high, almost fizzy carbonation level that seems to help spread the oil around.  Overall Impression: Wow, thats a kick in the head; I guess thats a wallop. I think they put about 2 truck loads of hops too much in the boil, but the result is definitely interesting. Im thinking this would age out very nicely, as it is, it seems a bit hot. If that comes from the alcohol or the hops, Im not sure. You like hops?

345,14916,ShamasUVA,1.76,"Imperial IPAs are one of my favorite styles... and Victory is an excellent brewery, so when I saw the Hop Wallop for sale I was extremely excited. Unfortunately, this is the worst IIPA I have ever had!  The entire problem with the beer lies in the total lack of any malt flavor. The beer is yellow and fizzy, like a german lager. I don't know how they got 8.5% ABV in this thing, because malt-wise, this tastes like a strong pilsener. Even in very blonde IIPA's I've had (The Blonde Hop Monster from Paper City comes to mind), there was a very solid, if simple, sweetness to it, to balance out the hops. This beer had nothing of the sort.  On the bittering front, yes this is very bitter, but lacks the serious hop complexity of the better IIPAs such as the 90 minute IPA and the Ruination.  Incredibly dissapointing. I'll stick with the Storm King and the Hop Devil when I am choosing Victory brews.  (UPDATE: I have had this beer since this very old review, and I find it to simply to be inconsistent. I have had awesome examples on draft. Had fresh bottles from the brewery which were good, not great. But I also encounter bad bottles from time to time.)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,timtheenchanta,4.02,Golden with tons of lacing all the way down the glass. I didn't expect to see all of this lacing.  Spicy hops and some citrus fruit dominate the nose.  The hops overpower any other tastes that might be hidden in the beer. There's some citrus in the back that's very faint.  Fuller that I expected for something so hoppy. Also a bit creamy feeling. Great beer but not one I want to have all night... especially at 8.5%.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,hero27,3.62,"12 oz bottle.  Pristine clear gold color..surprisingly clear for a double ipa.  Grassy hop aroma and a hefty hop profile all-around. Some citrus with an orange peel kick.. The taste is quite bitter and somewhat complex, but you can taste the 8.5% alcohol without much effort. Toasted malts lie in the background, resting upon the somewhat surprisingly thin mouthfeel and texture. The carbonation is alright and drinkability is pretty good...but overall, the word ""overhyped' comes to mind.  I've heard this beer has gone downhill lately, and maybe that's why I just wasn't too impressed with this one. I mean, alright for a hop fix, but not the wonderful creation I was hoping for.  Big thanks to Jetsbeer for letting me try this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,joedon,2.82,A lot of chill haze to the point of almost being murky in a yellow-amber brew. Nice rocky head with serious lace.  The smell has very intense hops and almost herbal background.  The taste was too bitter for me. Hoppy to the extreme but very little malt for balance. The aftertaste really makes your mouth pucker from the bitterness. Mouthfeel is appropriate for the style but still can't offset the boatload of hops. Also very rough-edged; not at all a smooth beer.  Not too drinkable for my money. I do like hops in my beer but this effort is just one-dimensioned hop insanity.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,marcobrau,3.94,"Oh, dear God, much to late in the evening on a Sunday for a review. (I'll try and make this legible.) This is one of those double IPAs that is all about the hop. There's not much color (the beer is blonde) so we know we've got 90 percent two-row pale malt in this baby; maybe a little light caramel. The carbonation is good, the head has a pretty good amount of volume. The foam sticks to the sides of the glass as the head falls; it's quite sticky. The aroma isn't as huge as one might suspect, it's kind of fruity and herbal. It's a gentle hop aroma, that's a bit insipid and almost sedating. I pick up a little lemon verbena perhaps? The mouthfeel is nice and smooth, but the body almost light; this beer seems quite attenuated. There's a good amount of alcohol, too. The strength of this beer is more noticeable in the brain than the palate. The finish is extremely hoppy and bitter. The hops are more present in the finish than anywhere else in this beer.

In this case, I am reviewing a fresh bottle (dated 11/10/05)--which to be truthful, ain't bad.  A - I love the look of this beer in a glass. It looks robust, formidable, and serious. The color is a complex yellow, tinged with the slightest greenish hue. Lovely.  S - On tap, this beer is a golden god. The smell is amazingly fertile and earthy. In the bottle, it loses some of that aromatic muscle.  T - Same issue. On tap, it is fresher than fresh--just bursting with newly sown hops. In the bottle, it loses a little...life.  M - Hard to complain about the mouthfeel. This is a man's beer, with a mouthfeel that makes me want to go sleep in the woods. Don't ask.  D - OK, so it's not on tap.

Smells really gently of woody hops. Not much else. Tastes piney, yet also like bark. Bark dust from those vines that string themselves into tree branches. Dry beer. Pine and oranges. Orange flavored wood? It has a rough character like grass on the tongue. Orange oil. Mouthfeel is liquid grass. Leaves a grassy weedy character in your mouth. Interesting.

Taste - A real nice grassy hoppy taste with on a real mellow malt backbone. The balance is very nice. Of course, this is way too hoppy for some, but I am used to it since I usually drink one of these every other night. I wish I knew what kind of hops are involved here because there are alot of DIPAs that I'm not fond of because of the pine sap taste.

Had to go back and check other's reviews to make sure it was supposed to be this light. Pours a straw color. Crystal clear. Thick white cap floated on top for a while then reduced leaving a thick ring of lace. Besides the color this beer looks like it is hitting the mark. I still can't get over the color...  Aroma doesn't do anything for me. I hardly get anything out of it. Has a grassy, herbalness to it. A bit of biscuit sweetness. A little floral essence.  Geez...what a difference in the flavor. Initially coats the mouth with a thick layer and a spicy burn takes over the back of the throat. Definately a new interpretation of the style for me. I like how this one isn't just another west coast wannabe DIPA. Lots of resin bitterness. Not much malt to balance really, but does come through with some sweet biscuit again. I agree with the notion of others that this is a kicked up Prima Pils. Lots of the same profile.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but coats the mouth well initially. Finishes a little dry. Nice and crisp overall. Ridiculously drinkable. No hint of alcohol, one-off flavor, plenty of resin bitterness, light on the stomach are all qualities making this beer super drinkable. Its just too easy to put down.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Litterbean,4.47,"Straw yellow in color, with a good head that leaves a lot of lace. Probably one of the palest beers I've seen, let alone a double IPA. How'd they do that?  The smell is something else. I would literally write home about it. From the moment the cap comes off, your nose is bombarded with piney, citrusy, grassy, herbal, floral, earthy hop aromas. The amount of hops in this beer is staggering. Never, ever, have I smelled something so wonderful.  The taste, oh LORD, the taste. Imagine all the hop qualities I listed above, then multiply them by four. This is an intense, hoppy beer. However, it is also pleasant and surprisingly smooth. Obviously, these are some noble-ass hops. The underlying malt current serves for a nice last minute burst of sugary sweetness. If not for the fruity, sweet esters of the malt, I would probably think this was a huge, hopped up version of Prima Pils.  What can I say? It's everything a DIPA (and a beer) should be, and more. Absolutely delicious.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Maybe a very slight hint of sweet malt underneath, but the hop aroma is massive.  Taste: Big resinous hop flavor across the entire taste, with a nice solid bitterness as well. Not much malt flavor, but that is to be expected for this style. Hoppy, but not quite up to the DIPA hoppiness that I am used to. Finishes dry and spicy, very thirst quenching. Mouthfeel is light, as is to be expected for a pale ale.  Drinkability is higher than I would have expected for an 8.5% beer. Goes down very easy.  I have been hearing grumblings that this year's version is not as good as in years past.

The citrusy-blossom and grassy smells like a healthy alcoholic treat. The flavor is not as bitter up front as the name would suggest; their is a bit of buttery smooth quality and a great amount of fruitiness. There is a lot of juicy hop flavor that hits you in the aftertaste. The sticky hop oil stays in your mouth for a while. The fact of aftertaste brings the drinkability down just a touch.

Appearance is a medium darkness golden hue. Tons of little tiny bubbles rise to the top to keep the head in full formation. Tons of lacing is left behind. Great appearance. Downhill from there on; as if I were skiing the Super G down a slope in Switzerland downhill.  Smells just like freshly sliced South Carolina peaches. I can see the red inards of the peach as I slice it in half and nibble on the pit for a bit. Of course I am assuming this is the hops. There is a bit of a burnt tire rubber smell as well that is a turn-off. The aroma then morphs into another citrua fruit; definitely grapfruit. But I love that peach smell.  At first sample, the beer is extremely bitter. Too bitter. The beer is not balanced and the hop bitterness is too much for my buds to take. I typically like DIPA but I havent had one with this big of a hop profile yet. Not my cup of tea. I really cant taste much besides the hops. As I drink the beer more, the mouth puckering effect diminishes a bit I guess due to my body getting used to the high hop rate.  Body is a bit emaciated as well. Puckering mouthfeel that is reminiscent of lemon rinds or fresh lemon juice sucked right from an underipe lemon one receives in ones sweet tea. Not really enjoyable. I will cellar two and revisit this bad boy in one year and two years. ...  3/9/07 Well, after a year of cellaring, I thought I would give this one another go. The ratings numbers above are based on my original review and will not change with subsequent reviews.  Appearance is nearly identical with one exception: No head retention or lacing. Carbonation seems to have ceased quite a bit. A- 2.5  Aromas are mostly orange rind and grapefruit. Some slight hay characteristics but mostly citrus fruits. S- 3.5  Bitterness has certainly decreased and has become quite enjoyable. Nice hop flavor with some malt body to back. That year certainly helped tone down the hop wallop that I so despised the last go round. T- 4.0  Mouthfeel is quite perfect indeed. Nice carbonation even though the appearance seems to dictate otherwise. Medium to full bodied and very well rounded. M- 4.5  Overall impression is that this is a nice beer with a year on her. Certainly some would like that hop power as it is fresh but for me, I like it a bit older. This was certainly worth the wait. One more in the fridge for next year; lets hope she lasts.

Strong hop aroma; smells like boiling wort after the last hop addition.  Pine hits upper palate first. A little astringent. Alcohol warming, some maltiness to balance the strong hop character. I've had this on tap and prefer it that way, unlike the Storm King which I actually prefer from a bottle.  Mouthfeel: hop astringency mars the drinkability of this one. Almost a chalky feel.

I tried the stout glass since I was not impressed with the overall taste in the bottle. The glass seemed to help open up the beer. In the bottle the beer carried a flatter and sour or tart taste to me (if that makes sense). In the glass the bubbles (still rising) seem to really release the hoppy aroma and make this one more complex and with a cleaner taste than right from the bottle.  Bottom line. I really like Victory's hop devil. However there's something with the hop wallop that I am not sure of.

345,14916,brentk56,4.03,"Appearance: Pours a surprisingly clear golden body color with just a hint of amber; the fluffy head retains well and leaves very good lacing  Smell: Primarily spruce and pine, but a bit of grapefruit citrus and floral qualities as well  Taste: From the start, there is a brief neutral holding pattern of pale malt flavor while the hops rev their engine and take over the taste buds; very piney and bitter/lemony on the finish, there is a tingling sweetness on the tip of the tongue; a bit of alcoholic warming on the finish  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  Drinkability: Unlike Hop Devil, which is assertively malty and hoppy, this beer is all about the hops",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,delicious,4.59,"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle.  Pours a white head that leaves rings of lace down the glass as the clear yellow body is consumed. Smells strongly of apricot and tangerine. Very fruity hop taste of mandarin oranges and grapefruit followed by a bitter feeling after the swallow  like chewing on a grapefruit rind. Both the smell and the taste assume more ruby red grapefruit qualities as it warms. The hops conceal the 8.5%ABV and induce a kind of infatuation that really boosts the drinkability. Everything after that first sniff was hop-heaven, and the end bitterness got me securely hooked and wanting more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,rhoadsrage,4.32,"(Served in an American pint glass)  A- This beer pours a pale yellow crystal clear body with a gentle carbonation of tiny bubbles. The smooth creamy pure white head turns to a thin film.  S- The smell of green floral hops have an earthy, pine and pineapple qualities. There is a hint of fresh pale male in there also.  T- This beer has a nice juicy hop taste with notes of pineapple and floral green hops. There is a soft pale malt flavor that really compliments the hops. The finish is a nice hop bitterness with a hint of alcohol and white pepper.  M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with a faint alcohol warmth after the finish.  D- Nice juicy hops are supported by alcohol and some malt flavors to really boost the hops even more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,orfeu,4.1,"Amber peach juice with a thin foamy cap and kick-ass sticky lacing. The nose is a big ol' smack of piney hops witha juicy tangerines and grapefruits lingering underneath. Biting and bitter grapefruit flavor with little malt sweetness. Kind of like if SN Celebration got kicked up stylistically to a DIPA, but without raising the malt level of the original. Unexpected metallic twang at the finish. Not a trace of alcohol. Smooth, juicy mouthfeel. Crushing drinkability as the 8.5% abv is nowhere to be found. I'd prefer less metal and more malt balance, but this is certainly a fine-ass brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,RedHaze,4.42,"Pours a pale, hazy orange with a one finger head that settles quickly to a thin cap with retty nice lacing.  Smell; wow, lots of grapefruit, a little orange peel and just a hint of pine trees.  Taste; the grapsfruit really stands out in this, with a pretty nice malt backbone, followed by some orange zest and piney flavors. There's less bitterness than I was expecting for a double IPA, and I get absolutley no alcohol as I drink this. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit oily. This goes down way to easy for such a high abv.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,IceAce,4.29,Twelve ounce bottle with 'Enjoy by Oct 18 06'  Pours a hazy yellow / gold with a full finger of dense off-white foam. Aroma is bright with citrus and syrupy with alpha acid promise. This is without a doubt the most unique and hardest nose to describe that I have ever come across.  Entry is anything but subtle as perfect carbonation caresses the tongue as the alpha-attach begins. First victim of the unceasing thrust / parry is the roof of the mouth and it simply collapses under the weight of the hops. Midtaste sees the tongue quite literally crushed within the vice-like Humulus Lupulus.  The finish begins with a fleeting glimpse of the sturdy malt before the enamel is stripped from the front teeth. Mouthfeel is superb for this truly one of a kind brews.  Many thanks to Secret Santa froggyfrog for this gem!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ejquin,4.18,"A: Burnt orange with fluffy white head  S: Hoppy and citrusy with orange peel and lemon zest. Smell's like a mix between an IPA and a Belgian  T: Nicely hoppy but not too extreme. Malt in the background wants to push through but never does completely. Heavy citrus. Very little alcohol perception and nicely balanced for a DIPA.  M: Maybe a tad lighter than I'd like but perfect carbonation.  D: Very good.  Ovr: Definitley a very nice beer. Not massive enough to crak into my top IPA's, but something I'd definitely drink again when I have the chance.

In one corner we have Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA and in the other we have Victory Hop Wallop, truly a battle to close to call. This is the first IPA that I've had that can be mentioned in the same breath as 90 Minute. Hops gallore and just the right amount of alcohol make this one of the most drinkable IPA's around. Plus the label is one of my favorites!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,quasimoto,3.37,"A - Poured a light cloudy golden yellow with a nice head that laced nicley.  S - Strong hops, (duh!) But they were sweet, I liked it. Very pleasant  T - Strong hop flavors, followed by very minimal malt flavors. Almost a let down.  M - There is no bitterness at all. Well very minimal.  D - It a very drinkable beer, but a little lacking in flavors.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,bjohnson,4.2,"A: Pours a golden color with an orange hint, small almost non existent head.  S: Aromas of citrusy hops. you can smell that there are hops in there. Hint of pine also!  T: Very PINEY but also some citrus in there. nice piney aftertaste--I feel I like I just ate pine needles. Definately hop hop hoppy! Tastes much different than the smell.  M & D: Mouthfeel is very good--love the taste of this one, especially the piney taste. Not as bitter as I thought it was going to be--smooth with a nice consistency and well balanced. Emma didn't appreciate it as much as I did.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,SwillBilly,4.32,"12 oz bottle  Appearance: Pours a golden hue with a nice 1"" densely foamed white head. Decent head retention and ample lacing line the pint glass.  Smell: Loads of citrusy hops and pine like scents. Hints of fresh cut grass, herbacious.  Taste: Hops, Hops and more Hops. Begins somewhat mellow, sweet and herbal then transitions to a big time, grapefruity hop bomb. Very long, bitter, dry finish. No hints of alcohol but I feel its warmth.  Mouthfeel: Somewhat slick and oily, plenty of carbonation.  Drinkability: This is one of the seasonals that I can't wait for from Victory. If big, juicy, citrusy hops are your thing then Hop Wallop is a must try. I could definitely drink a few of these, but its not a session beer by any means and if you plan on having anothe style of beer after a few Hop Wallops, think twice. A few of these could wreak havoc on some taste buds. Overall, a fantastic, big, hoppy DIPA that is a must try. Glad that its readily available in my area. Seek and enjoy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Enola,3.73,This beer poured with a decent sized head. The color is a cloudy orangish yellow. The smell is a bitter hoppy smell. The taste is very fruity. The mouthfeel is a bitter-sweet texture. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. Victory's Hopdevil tastes more potent than this. I *could* drink these one after the other but I'm not sure I could make that many trips to the fridge before my legs got unusable. This is a beer that has the potential to sneak up on you.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,HugoGrim,4.15,"Served on tap at the Victory brewery.  Thick head, with lace down the entire glass. The body is crystal clear and golden in color.  Scent is mostly citrus with a strong piney hop oil kick.  As almost everything from Victory, you can't go wrong if you love hops. Nothing else really comes through, but nothing else needs to. The hop flavor stood up against a spicy/sweet barbecue pork sandwich, which is saying something. Sports a dry finish.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,AaronRed,4.23,"I had to try this one. With increasing availability of easily drinkable high alcohol beers, I was exicited. Very nice straw looking brew, with good head, but not too much to take away the flavor. You can smell that is an extreme IPA a foot from the glass. It has a distinct flowerly aroma. Flavor is not something to worry about here- loads of it in the hops. The bitterness hits hard, but is easy to adapt to. This beer cuts through everthing. I have a feeling you could be eating chocolate, and this beer would still come through. Overall an very enjoyable brew that also happends to pack a punch.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BEERchitect,4.12,"A terriffic IPA! It has all of the hop bittering, flavor, and aroma that I'll ever want. Very spicy, floral, and earthy. Not vegetable or overly sweet. Has a solid barley malt character, but there is no conflict with the hops. The hops are pronounced in the nose and dominates through to the finish. Body weakens a bit in the finish, providing a easy drinker and allowing the hops to dominate one last time before the next sip. The hops are way out of balance from the malt--and it should! Thanks kmpitz2!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,SwillinBrew,3.55,"Being a hop head i really looked forward to finally having this one.  A - a golden honey color with a rather thin white head. Lots of bubbles coming up the glass which was very nice. S - Definitely hops here of pine and green vegetation ending on some bready notes. T - Bitter pine resin hits the palate. Somewhat raw and herbaceous then it seemed to stop there. I love hops but it seems this brew was in need of more malt backbone to bring out and carry the hops. Kind of like a cake needs some salt to enhance the sugar. Well, this one was like hops were just discovered so bunches were tossed in. A bit astringent. M&Dr - Bordered on the dry side and good carbonation. I dont care for this one enough to continually drink it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,silenius,4.5,"Very slightly hazed gold with a nice creamy head that lasts a long time. Pinpoint carbonation continually floats to the top.  Smell is nicely floral and malty with a load of grapefruity pith hops. Well balanced.  Taste begins on the bready and sweet side and quickly shifts gears into full on grapefruit hops. Again, well-balanced for such a hoppy beer.  Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with scrubbing bubbles.  Highly drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,brewdlyhooked13,3.78,"Appearance - light lemon/straw color with some light haze. Soapy half-finger of head retains and laces well and does a good job of holding the aroma.  Aroma - all business. Minimal florals, the Wallop concentrates on the piny aspect of the hops to the point of having a slight skunk/metal trace. This beer is wound tightly around the performance of the hops and will live or die by it.  Taste - true to the nose, the taste is the bitter side of the hop, no citrus or florals to be found. Loads of pine and grapefruit rind smother the palate. This is indeed a 'very hoppy ale' as the label dictates and should please hopheads more often than not. Considering the brewer, they obviously hit their mark. Ends dry and bitter, no other flavor stands a chance.  Mouthfeel - very lively and gassy, keeps the hops 'dry and tight' as intended.  Drinkability - worth the price of the sixer but not my everyday beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,OldFrothingSlosh,4.6,"From the beer engine at Capital Ale House.  Cloudy bright apricot in color. Thick, sudsy white-colored head. Astounding amounts of lace on the glass....big, thick globs of lace. Aromas, though somewhat softened from what I recall, still resonate with esters of citrus fruit and raw pine oils. Flavor is ever so slightly smoothed around the edges vs. the bottled version. Copious backbone of malt pairs nicely with the inevitable onrush of hops. I didn't perceive the ABV as much with this serving type. Smooth fininsh of lingering juicy-bitterness. Amazing how the first (and second) pints disappeared. Awesome stuff, now easily available in the RIC. Giddyup.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Cascade hops on the nose...quality cascade. Clean, refreshing. Pours an awsome clean amber with not much of a head. Upon pouring, the nose really opens up, but the taste is what ""wallops"" you...but not in a bad way. Alcohol is covered nicely, and there's still balance with the malts. I love all Victory's offerings, but this one makes me wanna dry-hump the old dude on the bottle it's that good. Love, love, love this stuff!!! Way to go Victory!!! Job well done with this 2005 batch.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

It has a nice balance of sweet hop and bitter hop aromas. Citrusy and a little floral as well. Everything I could expect, and a nice job of it.  T: Holy hop-wallop is right. I think I got one stuck in my teeth. Very Hearty. Probably one of the hoppiest beers that has ever graced my lips. Citrusy, sour, and bitter throughout. Pine. They didnt over-do the bitter or sourness, but definitly enough to keep me pleased. Nice kick in the finish. The alcohol is warming also.  M: The mouthfeel is full, maybe not as heavy as the taste that comes along with it, but still quite nice.  D: A very drinkable beer. I'm not sure I could handle them after 3 or 4 or so, but I'm damn pleased with the first few.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,macpapi,4.2,"As a Hop Head have been anxious to review this beer for quite a while. Hop Wallop pours a light orange color with a pretty full white head and good lacing. Smells of hops, citrus and pine aromas. Very nice, full and crisp in the nose. Tastes strong and bitter. Citrus is also present--dominated by grapefruit. High alcohol per volume is also obvious. Floral hops stringency is also noted. In the mouth H.W. is biting. It is full on the back of the swallow and its overall bitterness has a very strong feel on the tongue. Overall, this beer is too drinkable for one of such a high amount alcohol. Yet, the hop bitterness would probably slow down even the most avid hophead after two or three. On the whole most impressive and more than worth a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,CJfromPhilly,3.23,"Pours a surprisingly light golden yellow color that is a little on the hazy side. Develops a short-lived half finger head that dissipates into a modest lacing. Low to medium carbonation. Aroma is nothing but hops, intensely piney and super strong. If you jammed raw hop cones into each nostril I don't think the aroma would be any more intense! Taste is just what the aroma advertises, all hops, all the time. Hops on the front of the tongue, hops on the sides, hops in the middle, hops in the back, with a thick, lingering coating of hops on the swallow. If you let a mouthful linger a little while the bitterness does seem to give way (either that or the tastebuds just go numb) to something resembling a hint of...malt? There's not even an attempt at balance, this is raw hop juice, plain & simple. We've all had malt liquor, this may be the world's first Hop Liquor!! Just a little too overpowering, i'm not a real fan of the 10 megaton hop bomb. Gimme a HopDevil instead!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Pours out to a slightly hazy yellow orange color with a nice head that calms to a thin layer of foam over the beer. Lacing is present and abundant. Medium low level of carbonation. Aromas of hops are dominant, along with hints of yeast and bread. Taste is similar; flavors of hops and zesty malts, with bread dough and fresh green earth. Nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety. Good drinkability. The more Victory brews I sample, the more I like them. Recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,LPorter33,3.54,"Purchased single bottle from Martignetti's  Appearance = Odd color for a DIPA. Golden clear straw colored, more reminescent of a pilsner. Pretty pathetic head with average lacing.  Smell = Weird smell for a DIPA also. Hopped up but smells more like a lager injected with hops- mostly citrus fruits, apricots and peaches dominate. It's just an odd mixing although pleasant.  Taste = The peach and apricot flavors dominates which are fueled by some coarse hops. There's an interesting smokey aftertaste that tastes strangly like the smell of a darn good pipe tobacco. It's extremely unique but gets a bit tiresome after awhile. Alcohol is present and the 8.5% isn't hidden well. This is a very unique and bizarre DIPA. Not as balanced as some of the better ones I've tried. Still the overall flavor is good, I'd just rate the drinkability much lower.  Overall = Good tasting, very unique beer. I can't say the drinkability is too high though as I wouldn't want more than one of these. I'm glad I tried it and recommend any fans of this style give it a shot. It just can't stack up to the better DIPAs out there (90 minute, Ruination) though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,sopor,3.8,"Brilliant, clear, light amber with a finger of dimpled sheeps wool head. Just a hint of stink buried in a nose otherwise dominated by crisp hops.  The flavor is almost all hops, a light malt to match the color is almost totally hidden under the abrasive and tar-like hops, with a very strong medicine-like aftertaste. Hops taste like a noble variety, making this like a Imperial India Pilsner or something. Either way, it works pretty good, but I am a hophead. If youre not a big hop-fan, this is not for you.  Fuzzy (as opposed to stinging) carbonation adds to an already pleasant, middle of the ground body. Not a tosser due to the abv, and slightly the hop, but well worth starting the night out with!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,MainSpark,4.3,"Poured into a snifter, the beer presented itsel clear, bright, and golden. The head, though not large, was an off-white cream. As the head dissipated, the lace ringed the glass, unbroken. Carbonation was slight, languid.  Hoppy? You bet. Citrusy, with resinous overtones. Although the beer's temperature was within the recommended drinking range, the ability to pick up minor nuances might have to wait until the next, warmer, beer.  Yes, the citrus is hard to miss. For my palate, it was grapefruity, and pleasantly so. The malt's in there but never made a grand entrance nor made a prolonged stay. Oh, yeah...Hop Wallop. The grapefruit reasserted itself and stayed 'til the end, lingering, gently fading.  The mouthfeel was right there - not too thin, never thick. It was flat dog, just right!  Higher marks for drinkability, the 8.5% never really making a nuisance of itself. But beware.  This is one brew that I'll stock. I think that I can make a case last for two years....hopefully.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ElGordo,3.6,"Pours a bright golden color with a creamy, stark white head that has good staying power. Aroma of spicy floral hops, a bit of light malt, and notes of pine and grapefruit. Palate is dominated by spicy floral hops, only slightly balanced by the lightly sweet malt. Pine, grapefruit, and a light biscuit character can be detected. Finish is pure lupulin, yet more bitter than other strong IPAs (90 Minute, for example). Body is smooth and full, yet still easy enough to drink. Maybe it's the choice of hop varietals, but this doesn't seem like an exceptional beer to me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,scruffwhor,2.81,"Poured a hazy golden starw color with a hint of amber and a two-finger head. Smelled very earthy, not as much hops as I expected. Taste started out overwhelmingly grassy, but finally finshed with the hops bitterness and alcohol. The alcohol helped the palate warm up and relax after it was put through the odd splash of earthy flavors. Not counting what I tasted, the beer would go done pretty easy even with an 8.5% abv.  Was very surprised by the flavors that assaulted my senses. I like Like IPAs of all kinds, but this one just didn't taste right.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,bahumutx,4.22,Served from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  Appearance: Pours a hazy gold with about nice head that is dissipating slowly.  Smell: As soon as I poured this beer my nose was assaulted with the smell of hops. I am picking out citrus and pine smells along with a slight malt sweetness.  Taste: Just like the name indicates my tongue is assaulted with hops. There are hints of orange and pine from the hops. The beer finishes with malt sweetness that balances that hop flavor out great. There is also a slight alcohol warming and some graininess.  Mouthfeel: Smooth Mouthfeel with a bit of carbonation.  Drinkability: I could probably have one or two of these due to the insane amount of hops and the higher ABV.  Yet another great beer from Victory brewing. This is a great double IPA with a lot of hop flavor but it is still balanced with malt sweetness. Great Job!!!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,rousee,4.25,Pours a nice gold color with a 3 finger head. Most of the foam diminishes immediately but there is still a nice amount that remains. Very nice carbonation amd beautiful lace.  Smell is fairly gentle for a IIPA. The taste is excellent and more balanced than many other IIPAs I have tried. It still delivers a real hop punch or wallop as the name suggests. The hoppiness has a certain sour character to it but it is still quite nice. An excellent beer. This might be my favorite offering so far from Victory.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,MarineHokie,4.08,"A - Clear golden color, with orangish tint, two finger white head, fades slowly to a thick island with varying bubble sizes, thick sticky lacing.  S - Aroma adverstises immense hop flavor to come, hints of grainy sweetness fight through.  T - Crisp, grainy, bitterness with a solid light malt backbone, finishes bitter with notes of pine/grapefruit. Slightly sweet malt fights through at the end, leaving a nice balance on the palate.  M - Medium body, crisp but full mouthfeel.  D - Very drinkable, but maltiness through the hops gives away the relatively high alcohol content.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jslot38,3.85,"Appearance: Slightly hazed, orange copperish golden colour. Head is a bit frothy, with some bubbles, pours to two inches, quickly disappates to half an inch.  Smell: Yeah... you can smell the hops. A bit of a citrus, orange peel, background to it.  Taste: ""Holy hops"" where the first two words that I muttered outloud after my first sip. And it holds true, I wasn't wrong. Hops are quite simply all over the place. But to disect the hops for a moment: slight pine grass, sappy hops, with detectable oils. But thats not all, there are a few lingering citrusy notes to it as well. A beautiful blend of hops, thats for sure. Malt backbone is virtually non-existance but slowly helps in revealing a nice lingering aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Certainly a bit harsh on your tounge, but with the hops it also allows for a slick oily down going.  Drinkability: Couldn't take more than two of these, too much hops for me. Certainly the hops add to the beer, and make it uniquely good, but more than two and I'd be down for the count with hops.

345,14916,clabaugh,4.12,"Appearance: A hazy yellow, with lime-like hints. Pours a foamy head with a pristine whiteness. The lacing is bubbly, and remains steadily throughout the beer.  Smell: Floral hops invade one's nostrils. The hops do pack a wallop as the name implies, but it's an inviting wallop. I'm reminded of a porch full of chrysanthemums during fall. Despite the intense hop presence, sweet malts also reveal themselves. A bready flavor, even a pastry flavor, fight through the power of the hops.  Taste: The hops are the dominant flavor, with a bitter floral sensation taking precedence. A nice spiciness reveals itself as one partakes. The malts provide a welcome sweetness that balances the hops to produce a fine flavor. A bitterness that is pleasing to the tastebuds exudes itself.  Mouthfeel: Fairly light in body with some formidable carbonation. A lingering aftertaste stays with one, allowing one to savor the beer.  Drinkability: The bitterness accumulates after a period of time with the beer. But as well-balanced as it is, this beer is certainly drinkable to a great extent. Intensely hoppy in character, while presenting adequate sweetness, Hop Wallop is another victory for Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

S: Hops, grapefruit, cotton candy maybe?  T: I had heard so much about how hoppy this brew was, but I really didn't get that from it. I actually thought the hops were very nicely balanced with a strong malt backbone and some sweet citrus.  M: Light, almost like a hefe. I feel like most double IPA's are good winter beers - this might break the mold and be a helluva beer to sip out on the beach, or on a lazy river ride.  D: Soooo drinkable - almost evil. At 8.5% this thing goes down so easy. I am having to restrain myself from finishing these bad boys off in one night.  All in all, its a good DIPA, however I think the sweetness overbears the hops. I might even classify it is a Double Pale Ale - if that makes any sense.

T: The hops dominate the taste, but it has a nice complexity. Sour citrus fruits, grapefruit is noticable. Has a nice bananna like aftertaste that lingers for quite some time. M: Feels a bit thin, but has that nice bitter hop bite. Burns a little in a good way. D: This is a very tasty beer but one or two of them would be enough for me. Mainly because of the 8.5% and hoppiness. I would recommend this to anyone that likes hoppy beers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,orsulacp,4.34,"This beer poured a clear golden color with a small white head. The smell is awesome, piney, some citrus, and a bit of biscut in the background. The piney nose is amazing. The hops are all over this one. Resin sitting on the tongue leaving a piney bitter taste, the malt is trying to wash the taste away but it can't. Good medium body, a bit too much carbonation. It drinks real easy, the aftertaste is almost as good as the real taste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,nortmand,4.85,"Pours light amber with an inch of white foam. Minimal lace.  Nice huge hoppy smell, but typical cascade citrus. Some ""rarer"" hops would have been perfect. Rich malty backbone and some alcohol in the nose.  The flavor of this beer way outdoes the smell. Wow! The citrus hops are there, but also some smooth raisiny caramel. Very good. Slight alcohol burn. Leaves a spicy burn long after the swallow.  Smooth, round and full mouthfeel. Very dangerously and expensively drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BrinkyBeerBoy,5,"12 oz. bottle with great label for the season, and the story of Horace ""Hop"" Wallop ending with ""Hoppiness is Happiness"" Oh so true.  Pours a wonderful creamy thick off-white 1"" head. Colour is beautiful in a balloon glass. Clear amber/golden hue. Held this up in front of a fire in my fireplace on the first snow fall here in Harrisburg, PA. Perfect day for this perfect Hoppy Ale.  Sweet grapefruit, bitter grapefruit rind, touch of mango, and spicy pine on the nose. I must of had my nose in the glass for a good 15 minutes before taking a sip. Such a great thick aroma!!  Perfect smooth, creamy mouthfeel then unleashes the slick grapefruit rind hop oil that is intense yet tame. Just right, in fact in my opinion ""PERFECT."" Hops win over, but in the end a very slight caramelly sweet malt with the warming alcohol going down to the maw. The 8.5% is well masked, and creepy.  On the 3rd one I paired with my Wife's pork bbq that she made with 85 IPA from LBC. These are very drinkable, and after the 5th one I was sawin' logs on the couch in front of the fire.  Victory is just Awesome!!!!  I tried this for the first time with great food, football, on a snowy day in front of the fire. ""It doesn't get any better than this."" Great day with a Perfect Brew!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,beermanbrian,3.94,"Golden yellow in color with a small white head that dissapears quickly. Medium level of carbonation bubbles. The piney hops smell just blows you away. It almost smells sticky with hops juices and oils. The taste dosen't dissapoint, this is definately a hop wallop. I just can't get paste the piney hops flavor to get much of anything else. Bitter aftertaste that is not too harsh but sticks around for a while. The hops hides the alcohol and everything else. Something nice as a once a year kind of thing but not a beer i would want to drink all the time.  Kind of reminds me of what Weyerbacher is trying to do with hops infusion only much better. As my friend burd man put it; ""hops infusion is a punch in the face by a huge drunken lineman at a bar; hop wallop is a slap in the face by a hot chick!

345,14916,sacfly,4.62,"Best by Oct 11 06  Pours a crystal clear, light yellow/straw color. Almost looks like your average BMC. Thick, ivory white head. Aroma is an intense but well rounded citrus and pine hops.  First taste is awesome. Pine and orange peal dominate. A little sweetness just enough to let you know there is something other than hops in there. Better mouth feel and body than expected from looking at it. Lingering, but not harsh, bitterness in the aftertaste.  Much better than I remember last years version. Highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,RedwoodGeorge,3.42,"Pours a medium yellow with a thin white head. Not much crown to speak of (the high ABV probably breaks it down) and not much lacing. On first glance it looks like you're drinking a craft lager.  All hops in the nose - rather floral and herbal. The flavor is pretty similar, lots of floral hops here with only a hint of citrus peel. Not terribly bitter for a DIPA. Disappointingly, not much in the way of malt to balance out the beer. Some underlying sweetness but no grain notes that really stand out. Mild 'hot' note from the alcohol that doesn't compliment the rest of the flavors.  Mouthfeel is disappointing - not enough carbonation to liven up the palate, not enough bittering to sharpen up each sip and the alcohol burn detracts from the experience.  If I'm drinking a DIPA and I'm paying a (physical) price for the extra alcohol I expect something in return like a bold hop profile and a rich balanced malt base. The hops are quite nice but the lack of malt is a disappointment - I can think of more flavorful single IPAs with less burn.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,chOAKbarrell,4.05,"Thick bone-white head with super-pale body. Impressive how Victory got such a potent beer to be so light colored. The little story on the bottle label gives the impression that they used 3 different types of hops for this beer. Lovely floral hop smell. The taste is a powerful blast. Super bitter aftertaste, actually kind of harsh, with noticeable alcohol flavor. Thick & meaty mouthfeel. I enjoyed drinking this one bottle, but I think any more than that at one time would be pushing it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,kmpitz2,3.8,"Best by Oct 11 06. I'd say this one is fresh. Cellar temperature.  Pours a modest coppery orange color, vivid clarity, and a foamy 2 finger white head that is maintained by a huge cascade of bubbles from below. Nose is a little difficult to get at under the head. I get resinous hop...sweet citrusy with piney over a chunky caramel base, with an almost spun sugar sweetness. Flavor is okay. Hops are giving me a soapyness and a touch of metallic flavor. Hop flavors are piney for the most. Caramel is moderate. Bitterness is a bit rough and lingers pretty long...too long and too harsh. After some of the IIPA's I've had recently, this one really isn't stacking up for me. Mouthfeel is thick with a moderate carbonation. Drinkability is minimized by the harsh hop. I'm looking for some balance and not finding it. For the ABV, its downable, so that equalizes things a bit. I'll be sure to cool one down and see what that does to the beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ronhocker,3.39,"Lighter than I expected for a 8.5% brew. First smells indicated reminders of american macrobrews, but a deeper whiff revealed the intense hops, as well as barnyard hints and vegetables.  First tastes were also quite shocked by the shear amount of hops, but after a few drinks and letting the beer warm up a bit, it became suprisingly drinkable. Nice mouthfeel and carbonation. At the first drink I was ready to pour it out but by the fourth I was ready to order a case.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Wasatch,4.35,"This was given to me by warriorsoul, thanks again buddy. Pours a clear golden color, some carbonation, very small head, some lacing throughout the drink. Scents of hops, citrusy, pine (?). I really like the taste of this brew, the taste and smell is very different than other IPAs or DIPAs I've had. Nice bitter aftertaste. Medium body. Very drinkable, the color surprised the shit out of me, but I guess that's Victory's different slant, I would by this stuff every time if I could get ahold of some, highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Citadel82,4.13,"This rare treat pours a very pale orange color, the utter clarity of this beer is impressive. On top it is crowned with a thick frothy head that is tightly bubbled and goes nowhere for quite some time. Leaves plenty of thick, clumpy lace in rings around the glass, as the lace is thick wide and slow to fall. This beer is a feast for the eyes and a real treat to gaze at.  Smells of crystal and pale malt with strong fruity and floral notes surrounding, well nigh attempt to obliterate any vestige of malt almost choking it with extreme hoppiness - scents of grapefruit, tangerine peel, and sharp floral accents. Earthy aromas and herbal notes come to the fore eventually yielding to the aromas of malt come through in due course. A very hoppy nose indeed.  Tastes of straight hop flavors: grapefruit, orange pith with attendant citrusy bitterness, an flowery hop presence, and yet more citric spikes and floral notes. A small dried apricot presence comes to the fore here and there, and there is some but not much as far as balancing sweetness. Way in the background you can taste pale malt holding court but is vastly overwhelmed by the agressive hoppines. I could feel the warmth of alcohol down to my stomach. The medium/heavy mouthfeel is slick llike kool-aid and not quenching at all in the traditional sense.  The finish, which is only moderately bitter in the far back of the mouth, lingering for some time but with much reduced strength.  I am not a hop head but needless to say, I found this to be an immensely drinkable beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,deBeers,4.59,"Enjoy by 11/9/06.  Clear, light, golden ale with good head retention till the last drop. Perfect amount of carbonation, small bubbles when swirled, but oh my the smell!  Beautiful floral hop smell. Tastes delish. The hop/berries/herb smell is balanced so well for a IIPA. Crisp, citrusy, some sort of pine or spuce. This is superbly mellow and very drinkable. Definately not walloped by hops...more in the way of subtle beauty. Not what I was expecting but oh so pleasantly surpised.  I'm taking my time to enjoy this beer in its entirety. Also note that this was taken out of my pantry on a warm evening. Served relatively warm at just below the room temperature of our house (pantry is a few degrees colder).  Serve this one relatively WARM imho. Savor the flavor, the smells, the beauty and suttleness of a great IIPA. I believe this beer could help pave the way for world peace.  Thanks Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,SupaCelt,4.32,"Looks: Golden and clean. I am quite surprised at the colour after pouring this. A smallish white cap props itself atop the uncharacteristically coloured beer and holds for a few seconds before dissolving into surface froth. Random scattershot lacing and a few rather developed peninsulas form as I reduce the level of liquid by degrees. Sparse carbonation activity carries on within the liquid as confused looking little bubbles pop up and wander aimlessly upward.  Smell: Heavy grass and chlorophyll green outdoor scents ooze off the top of this brew. Smells of fresh cut spruce tops with sap and resin drizzle. A unique and intriguing hop boquet.  Taste: Somewhat funky. Not as bitter as I was expecting. Definite vegetable impressions from the abundance of hop matter that produced this flavour. Chlorophyll and grassy greenery. Pine and acidic fruitiness lie burried within the hefty green monster taste. The bitterness is actually quite subdued and the subsequent dry character of the finish seems overly mild. There really is not any true walloping going on here, but it does have a very nice, fresh flavour.  Mouthfeel: A bit light. The colour alone is enough to tip one off that this is not a very heavy beer from a malt body standpoint. Sure it has plenty of hops, but these don't lend any heft. It comes off crisp and fresh again but could be a bit more beefy.  Drinkability: Alright, this one really grew on me. I found this beer to be uninteresting and lackluster for the first few tries, then out of nowhere it just seemed to transform into a delicious brew. Very drinkable. Crisp. Fresh. One of the most unique beers I have ever had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Onceeven,4.07,"Follow up to the 2004 version:  I'd cellared the 2004 for a little over a year, to do a side-by-side comparison with the 2005 version. There's no comparison, drink this beer fresh! The hops dramatically faded with age, and had a mild stale flavor.  Anyway's, the 2005:  Pours the same clear amber, reminiscent of a pilsener, minus the bubbles. Hops smell different, apparently they changed back to the original hop varieties. Definitely more funk in this nose. There's a very distinct smell, but it's eluding me right now. A byproduct of Tettnang hops (new to me), if that is in fact what was used. Either way, incredibly fresh. Not overly bitter, in fact, rather smooth. The aftertaste seems rather.. I don't know how to describe it except for it's like chewing cardboard. I've had the same flavor come through in my home-brews, maybe it's the hops.... Slightly irritating, but I'm glad it doesn't just happen to me! I'll give this beer kudos for being a bit funkier than other DIPA's I've tried. I'm growing tired of the clean Cascade flavor.

345,14916,ColForbin,4.32,"Victory Hop Wallop is exactly what it sounds like - a beer that slaps you across the face with hops and leaves you begging for more. Pours a hazy light golden color with a fairly thin white head. Aroma is full of spicy and piney hops, so much that they almost burn the nose. Taste is a complete hop bomb, but with a firm body and a slight bit of toastiness to back it up. Slightly hot going down, but otherwise a great DIPA. I would buy this a lot if I could.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,baldmasterflex,3.92,"Picked up just after thanksgiving from the brewery in one of their growlers (conveniently located just 15 minutes from where i reside). Upon first pour i was disappointed, not from its appearance, but because i could have sworn i was served victory's pilsner or golden monkey due to its clear golden-orange-amber color. I was expecting a deep amber red. But, after getting a whif, there was no mistaking its identity. Smells like a mellowed grapefruit aroma. It has about a half inch head rising from a very slow pour. Its taste possesses that same mellow grapefruit-hoppy flavor that the smell does but with some citrus mixed in. The body and drinkability are so uncharacteristic of other beers Ive had of this style (Stoudts DIPA). It is very light and finely carbonated, just like the prima pils i almost mistook it foor. If any DIPA could be a session beer, id say it would be Hop Wallop (if any 8.5% abv beer could be a session beer). Although im not necessarily crazy about the style, Id definitly recommend this over and over again to someone who wants something with more of a kick when it comes to flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Smells like a big liquid hop. Very grassy, like I'm rolling around in a pile of hops. Tasty is fresh and bitter, aggressively hopped. It's actually kind of pointless to review this beer, cause the name tells you everything you need to know. It's hoppy and delicious, and is probably too smooth drinking for an 8.5% beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,doho95fu,4.08,"Another solid offering from one of the most consistent brewers in my opinion. I love hops, so i was excited to try this beer. It pours thick cloudy orange and to be honest I did not get much in the way of aroma. Bits of citrus and of course ... the hops. Soon as the glass hits your lips, you know the hops are coming and they do. Solid, not over the top with a strong finish. The beer is exceedingly smooth for such a strong sided brew. Sorry to hear this one won't be around all year.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,cubedbee,4.33,"Pours a light golden straw with two fingers of off-white head, good retenention, nice lacing. Hop aroma is strong, nice and fresh and grassy to begin with, a little citrus, and as it warms it becomes more piney. Taste is more of the big hops, citrusy and grapefruit primarily, although there is a biscuitlike malt lurking just in the background. Finishes with a nice long resinous hop aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, somewhat oily because of all the hops, with a nice crisp carbonation. This is definitely a nice hopbomb for those who like them, but after hearing this talked up so much, I'm slightly disappointed with my first try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

So sad to see this is a seasonal, but will buy as much of it as I can fit in my fridge. Smells fresh, with citrus and coriander; pours clear and ""mildly amber"". Tastes even fresher than it smells with floral blossoms from start to finish. The finish, by the way lingers just a little...could be more. All in all, one of my new favorite IPA's. Not as overly hoppy as some other double IPA's out there. Also, doesn't feel like 8.5% so watch out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Grassy and outdoorsy. Nice, but subtle... not as 'in your face' as alot of DIPAs I've had the pleasure of tasting.  Huge citrus flavour is beaten back by the hops. Very grassy... very nice. Once again, doesn't seem quite as pungent as many DIPAs, which I'm not sure I like... then again, it certainly enhances the drinkability.  Crisp and lively on the tongue. Moderate mouthfeel in terms of thickness... quite nice.... just right.  The overall drinkability of this brew is superb... in-line with that of DFH 90min, which I think is a stupendous brew. That being said, given my choice, I would take the 90min over this brew any day (something that pains me to say considering my love for Victory and their brews).

Taste is powerful hops- very bitter and citrusy. Quite delicious but there could be a litte more hop complexity here- the bitterness hits really hard and fast here and is obscuring some other flavors I think. There is some malt here but not enough to keep the hops in check which is perfectly fine for a double IPA. Mouthfeel is a very nice medium body feels quite nice in the mouth. Pretty drinkable for the style. A very nice beer overall.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,twelvsies,4.58,"2005 batch. A year later, after many more beers drank, I think I ""get"" this beer. It's definately a different approach to hopping than a lot of the double monster IPAs have, and I like that and can appreciate it now. It's more of a resiny, juicy, oliy soaked hop, with a lot of bitterness in the finish but not right up front. So much hop that it actually starts to take on a fruity characteristic like apples, or oranges, and that more usual grapefruit bite. Dry though at the same time. One thing I can't get over though is the color. It's amazingly light! You'd think a beer like this would have a much more robust amber color, but this one is straight up straw and crystal clear. Excellent lacing as I noted in last year's review. Snow-flakey. Smoothest mouthfeel of an IPA I've come across. Way too drinkable. I think I may try to stash a few of these away for the summer, as I think it'd be excellent in warm weather due to it's light body and refreshing taste. At the same time, it's robust and hoppy enough to be a winter seasonal, which it is. Awesome brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Clear gold with a small head of white that after a few minutes settles to a thin layer of foam with wispy lace. Almost looks...macro.  The smell is all sweetend grapefruit. The little extra sweetness might be from the malts, but my nose is telling me to get ready for a hop assault!  The taste follows along the same lines, but the hop profile is not overbearing. It all but conceals the biscuit like malts. Again, juicy, sweetend grapefruit is what's going on. This is a real DIPA and not some poorly disguised BW. Lingering fruity hop goodness in the after taste.  For style, the mouth is a bit light. More carbonation might help this out.

I didn't realize it was a DIPA until I started this review. Notes of tremendous pine and citrus emanate, there is a grainy smell as well. Hops abound in this one. Not so overpowering as some DIPA's can be, more like extremely hoppy Pale Ale.  I bought this at a pretty high volume package store and this was not there a week ago, so I am imagining it as being fresh.

All of these apply. Big hoppyness going on here. Hopheads, belly up to the bar. Pretty thick on the palate, unbalanced maybe, but definately has an appeal. Nearly palate ruining. If tasting among other brews, save this one for towards the end. Everything else will taste like water in comparison.

The mouthfeel is almost silky smooth, punctuated by a resinous hop finish. This is a hop monster and quite drinkable.

Such amazing pungent, fresh hops aromas with just enough malt presence to round it out but let the hops hog up the limelight. Resin, pine, citrus, light bread, a little caramel and hints of nuts and grass. The taste is good, but not nearly as impressive as the aroma led me to believe it would be. Quite bitter and out of balance. But a nice finish, long with lasting flavors of lemon rind and resin. It has a medium body, dry texture and soft carbonation. I guess Ive grown to expect a lot from Victory, and I dont think this one quite lived to my expectations. But then again I expect the best from them.

I thought I'd give this one another chance since the only other encounter was with an expired bottle.  It was so offensive to my taste buds that I didn't even finish it. Even in light of the fact that the beer came with the purchase of a pint glass & t-shirt. I found it was eating my stomach up. I do not have a weak gut.  It was all hops and nothing else. It didn't even pour a nice head. Wallops your senses so that all you can detect are hops. It is so harsh I could not even tell what type of hops. It was simply caustic!  I'll take a Alpha King or Tuppers anyday over this loser from Victory.  These guys are much more capable than this!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Not much of a white cap sits on top, but it lingers there for most of the drink, with decent lacing.  Aroma is really fruity and hoppy, with notes of tropical fruits like mangos and papaya, grapefruit and lemons. Thick, sweet, bready malts, great smells.  The first flavor is unmistakeably mangos, very fruity and estery, followed by juicy citrus hop flavors like grapefruit and lemons, and a bit of pine in the back. There is a good deal of residual sweetness, but there's plenty of hop bitterness to balance. The malt character is big and chewy, and the ABV is very well hidden. Aftertaste is long and bitter and sweet. Fantastic!  Mouthfeel is full bodied, with a soft to medium carbonation. Lips stick together from sweetness. Great burps. Finish is sweet, with a big grab at your throat from bitterness.  This is a very nice DIPA. Really fruity, hoppy, malty, and just scrumptious. Alcohol is almost undetectable. Deceptively strong, and addictingly delicious.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,veggiemafia,4.59,"Bottle with very clear best by date.  Fairly pale straw kind of gold. A little more pale than I had imagined it would be on the first pour. Moderate head, not very fluffy, but many different sized bubbles, and little islands have hung around through the first half of the glass pretty well.  Smell is WONDERFUL, enchanting hop hit backed very well by yeasty notes, and also a very very nice fruity thing, like raspberries or blackberries. All in all a really nice, really enticing smell.  There's not so much a whole separate malt taste to this one, but it's kind of always there behind the hops keeping them in line. Really bitter, but really fresh tasting and alive. All in all, if you dig hops, this beer is totally refreshing. Also, the alcohol never gets out of hand, and it really doesn't make itself known until the beer is pretty warm, but then in a very dry way accenting the spiciness of the hops. Really great hoppy, bready, yeasty bitter finish.  Very well carbonated, very refreshing feeling that only contributes to how good this beer is.  By far the most drinkable DIPA I've ever had, and my new favorite over 90 Minute. Too bad it's only available every now and again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jaluria,3.29,"A very pale straw color with white colored head that leaves behind nice lacing. The color was not at all what I was expecting for this style...looked rather watered down. The smell contained alcohol and hops but not much else. The taste is above average, but not grand or intense like most other DIPAs. The malt character in this brew is really suppressed and that prevents the beer from being as complex and rich as it would otherwise with more malt character. The hops are right there in the very first sip, but I'm expecting something more in the aftertaste, but it's just not there. The sourness in my throat is alright, but it is a bit astringent and unpleasant over time. The one redeeming feature of this beer is that it masks the high ABV (&gt;8%) very well. But, overall this beer is not all that it can be or that it should be, especially since it's a product of Victory Brewing Co...an excellent brewery.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,mrasskicktastic,2.93,"The new batch. Enjoyed it from a pint glass.  A - Pours a golden bronze with a one finger head which dissipates in about two minutes. Visible carbonation thoughout the drink.  S - Hops. Pine Hops mostly, though citrus is decernable. On every brewery tour, they pass around a bowl of some aromatic hops and invite you to smell them. That is basically what this smell is - pure, raw hops. The abv is absolutely undetectable.  T - Hops. Not too surprising. It is not very bitter even, just that crisp clean hoppy taste. I get no malt, no alcohol, nothing through the hops. I guess that is kind of the point.  M - A little drying. Thin. Nothing much to it.  D - Not too bad. It is strong, so too many will do you in, and the hops ravage your taste buds. After about half the bottle, I really didn't want anymore hops. For me, this beer raises a metaphysical question: What is the point in drinking hop juice? I guess I hoped for some depth to this brew. It is obvious that victory succeeded at what they wanted to do - make a ridiculously hoppy beer. But if a brewery set out to make the most disgusting stout in existence and succeed, should they get a five? No. Pliney the Elder is another hop motivated beer, but somehow that succeeds were Hop Wallop fails.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Terp96,4.3,"2005 Edition from Wine World, Abingdon, MD $10.25 for a six.  This is an amazing and perplexing beer. It pours a clean golden yellow with a solid head. It is indistinguishable from the Prima Pils which I also had on this occasion.  The nose is amazing. At first, burnt rubber came to mind. Weird but enticing. The citrus, pine aroma is very strong and very nice.  Taste may be the only weak point. The hops are good but somewhat overpowering. This isn't a bad thing but it takes away from the malt balance that you would expect. The alcohol taste is well masked until the end as the beer warms up a little. Obvious dry finish.  Mouthfeel was suprisingly good given the lack of malt presence. The beer stays on your palate for quite a while allowing you to enjoy the complexity of the hop flavor.  This is a very drinkable brew, provided you have an ample supply of water to cure the inevitable dry mouth. All in all, wonderful stuff. I will be stockpiling this as long as it lasts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,silver0rlead,4.05,"Pours an intense golden yellow with a thick white head, lighter than expected but looks menacing nonetheless. Aroma has huge citrus character (grapefruit, lemon, tangerine and lime), some pine resin, grass, big straw and bread dough malt profile and some funky esters. The flavor is fairly bitter, with some big citrusy, grassy and piney hop notes, along with some toasted biscuit, unbaked bread dough, fruity ale esters and mild phenols. Honestly this tastes more like a prima pils on steroids rather than hopdevil on steroids. Mouthfeel is a big light for the style (i expect a big, chewy malt profile on DIPAs) but drinkabilty is excellent for the style. I have to say im somewhat confused by this beer, it didnt really have the malt profile to back up the hops. Regardless, this is a tasty and complex beer regardless of style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,EStreet20,4.5,I love Victory beers and I love double IPAs. Glad I finally got my hands on this one.  12 ounce bottle poured into a Brooklyn snifter.  A - This stuff is golden. That's the only way I can describe it. A pure gold color with a nice two finger white head. Leaves rings of lace on the glass with every sip.  S - An extreme citrusy hop blast. It comes at me smelling like a mix of grapefruits and some piney hops. A hop blast to be reckoned with.  T - A nice malty taste on the beginnning of the sip and then a gigantic hop punch hits you hard. Extreme bitterness through the middle of the drink. A tiny alcohol bite but not much. Excellent taste overall.  M - Feels good on the tongue. Right amount of carbonation as it rolls around in the mouth.  D - I'm loving it. This is a beer that will keep me coming back for more. I'll have to stock up while the stores still have this year's in stock.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

345,14916,GClarkage,3.91,"08/19/05- Received via trade with Santoslhalper.  Presentation- 12oz bottle with a best by date printed on the label. Poured into my Englander pint glass.  Appearance- More golden than orange pour. Limited head as well. Maybe 1/4 inch at best when finished pouring. Leaves a nice creamy 1/8th of an inch ring throughout though. Excellent lace clings to the sides.  Smell- Not much emminates from the glass. When I smelled the bottle after popping the cap, it seemed much stronger than after being poured...weird. Slight scents of citrus and pine hops at best. What I can smell does smell good though.  Taste- Bready malt background...more than I was expecting. Nice citrus hop twang as well. More citrus than pine, but some of that as well. Not as overpowering as I was expecting.  Mouthfeel- Very much lacking in carbonation. This is a good thing and a not so good thing. Most beers I like to have lower carbonation levels, but in my IPA's I like a bit more. There is some, but not as much as I would seek in a perfect DIPA. It is however velvety smooth and creamy because of that.  Drinkability- I was expected to be ""walloped"" by hops, and sadly I wasn't. However, it is a perfectly acceptable DIPA. In fact it's pretty good. Different from most of them I have had in that the hops are smoother and more laid back, with a nice malt background and also a bit less carbonated for a smoother consumption. All in all a good beer that I would buy again for a nice change of pace.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Missouri  Enjoy by April 28 '05 Pours a slighlty orange gold with white head with persistent ring offering lace on the sides of the 0.4L Rastal sniffer. Distinct aroma of pink grapefruit pith and toasted malts. Flavors of sweet caramel. Shows off the hop juicy flavors of lemon and sugar sprinkled grapefruit. Medium to full body with a dextrinous mouthfeel. A great DIPA that is very drinkable.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,woemad,4.32,"Big thank you to Lostbearbrew for sending this my way. Hopefully those Poseidons will have reached you by now.  12oz bottle featuring a gentleman that appears to be a cross between Santa Claus and Snuffy Smith. Freshness date of ""May 11 05."" Oops. That unplanned trip out of town robbed me of a couple of weeks of freshness! Doh!  Poured a hazy shade of gold, with a modest white head. Light sheets of lace drip down the insides of my glass.  Smell is pleasingly hoppy, with a subordinate maltiness in the background. The hoppiness is more piney than citrusy, though both can be detected. Its actually more sedate smelling than I had imagined it would be. Dont misunderstand me. Im not disapointed with it at all. I guess I was expecting something a little more over the top.  For something called Hop Wallop, this is surprisingly drinkable. The taste starts out with a caramel sweetness, but this is then elbowed aside by a complex hoppiness. The most dominant note is one of pinyness, but there is a more mild, citrusy hoppiness present as well. The fadeaway is pleasingly dry, but not to an extreme degree. While the hops are definitely dominant, it's not a tastebud-scalding, beat-you-over-the-head hoppiness. This one is about hop flavor rather than a ""hop wallop."" While this might not live up to it's name, it's a damn flavorful hoppy brew.  This is thicker than the average IPA, with a more creamy mouthfeel. I suppose that's a by-product of the higher alcohol. I need to start homebrewing to find this stuff out for myself, I guess!  This would be an outstanding session IPA, if not for the fact that the abv would kick my ass after a while. I personally don't rank this quite as high as DFH's 90 Min, but I'd love to match them up against each other to find out for sure! Sadly, neither one is normally encountered in my neck of the woods.  Thanks again to Lostbearbrew for this tasty treat!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,charlatan,4.02,"This is remarkably easily to down for a beer of such strength (and thus easy to be downed by). Alcohol is apparent in the taste, but not overwhelmingly so. The feel is rather syrupy with relatively little carbonation, but pleasantly creamy. This helps the beer slide down deceptively easily.  It doesn't have quite the hop kick that its name suggests it might, but the hops become apparent after a sweet caramel and citrus combination gives way and before the creaminess really kicks in.  Backtracking somewhat, it has a fairly light golden colour with a considerable head which leaves plenty of lacing and offers a piney, slightly citrus nose.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,mynie,4.45,"(Thanks to beerislove for the trade)  Ever since I read the Mr. Natural strip where the little bastard blamed all of the country's problems on that sonnofabitch FDR--who should have rightfully been named, Natural insisted, Franklyn Delano Rosenfeld--I knew that the little R. Crumb prophet was, deep down, a drunken redneck. I'm glad to say I have a beer bottle that confirms this.  Pours nice--not like a regular IPA. It's much more yellow than red and not very hazy but it has an absolutely fantastic head.  Smells of harsh hops and caramel, very yeasty. Just strong enough, just complex enough.  Tastes like hops and caramel yeast with a strange lingering flavor of chemicals and pine in the back. The pine is nice, the chemicals are okay. Still, the hop and malt mix is very nice and the sour finish is easily ignored and soon your palate is burnt enough by the hops to where you can't even taste it.  The body is remarkable--creamy and very smooth, it hits your teeth like powdery snow, only not so cold. It goes down quite smooth, too. If this were a 6.0% abv it would only get a 4.0 but since I honestly cannot believe that this beer is above 5.0% (let alone 8.5!), it's getting a five.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,neonbrown82,3.99,"After being completely blown away by the Prima Pils, I was expecting more from the Hop Wallop. It wasn't bad, but it is not one of my favorite I2PAs.  The appearance is a bit light golden, only slightl rusty colored. It is slightly hazed, has an active carbonation, yet no head except for half-finger that settles to a tiny film.  The smell is very flowery and citrusy hoppy. Has a bit of a malty sweetness to it as well.  The taste is as the bottle says, ""Very Hoppy Ale."" Starts off with an up front caramel sweetness but eventually dominated by a surge of alpha acids, bringing forth a massive hoppy bitterness. The citrusy notes of the aroma are lost by bitterness in the taste, though they still exist in the aftertaste which is still dominated by a residual bitterness. The tongue begins to warm up to the bitterness by the end of the glass, but this ale seems not to be too well balanced in sweetness/bitterness. The finish is quite dry and bitter, and drinkability suffers due to this and high alcohol content.

Smell is hops, hops, and more citrusy, piny hops. The hop smell was very smooth, with almost lemony, and maybe a bit or orange peel as well.  Taste is amazing. Just an endless barrage of hops. A bit of sweet malt is present, and a little alcohol spiciness, but this is definitely ""hop juice"" at its best. Medium bodied, it finishes dry as a bone and bitter.  This is a little different than other Double IPA's, but if this is the direction that this style is going, no complaints here. This is incredibly drinkable for it's strength and size.

Pours a nice orangey/amber with a slight haze and some sediment that settles on the bottom of the glass. It has a 2 finger off-white head that makes nice pits and lingers nicely and contributes nice lacing. Lots of hops in the aroma - pine, citrus, tropical fruits, perfume, and a gentle floral aroma. The predominant hop flavors are grapefruit and pine along with a good amount of malt breadiness and sweetness behind it. The bitterness is strong but not as strong as when it was fresh, but it lingers forever and the alcohol warms the body nicely. Very smooth and thick and makes your mouth tingly.

Smooth with expected IPA bitterness. Some oil in the mouth.  app: Nice thick, puffy head, but suprisingly yellow. Thick ragged lace. Cloudy.  nose: a good, piney hop scent, but evidently nothing remarkable, according to my notes, that now seem rather sparse.  tastebuds: not nearly as hoppy as expected, or as I would have liked. A good beer, but not a 'hop wallop'.  mouth: pleasingly full bodied, very very smooth. Thick, oily mouthfeel.  drinka: Smoothness and taste=easy sipper.  Overall, a disappointment.

345,14916,Foxman,4.02,"It poured a deep gold, a shade short of orange, hazy with floaties. A dense finger of stiff white head lingered long before fizzling to pockets of froth. Smiles of lacing clung to the glass.  Pine and citrus and flowers came blasting into the air, with tendrils of alcohol darting hither and yon. A veritable malt sweetnes, with hints of berry, backed up the measure of the aroma.  The first sip washed a wave of toasted malt sweetness across the palate, complete with a lightly grassy series of berry fruit notes. The malt was quickly laid waste by the over-the-top resinous slick of hops bitterness carrying flotsam of pine and zesty citrus. Alcohol dares pop its head up throughout, when the hops let it. The finish is dominated by a mouth-numbing bitterness held steadfastly in place by the hop oils, and lingering especially long.  Medium bodied, the thick hops presence renders any sweetness a non-entity and clings tenaciously to the entire inside of the mouth. To say the palate glows would be an understatement.  The malt takes a stab, but the hops quickly lay claim to most of what this beer is, and the IBU's come off as damned close to overbearing. The ABV is very real and present, but it is the lesser culprit in limiting the drinkability. In fact, it is the cumulative, enamel-eating bitterness lingering dense in the mouth that makes many more of these a rather daunting task. And I love hops, but the bitterness ends up obliterating the taste buds, rendering them useless for a time. A more inimicable lupulophile than myself might drink these willy-nilly, but I just don't measure up.

There is a full, round bitterness that lingers for a while, but it's not really overpowering. Hop flavors of grapefruit and pine dominate. Some alcohol warmth is apparent on the swallow.

It was the only beer I had all night (apart from Heavyweight's Hoppy Saison) that held a head and left lacing about the glass. The hop aroma didn't seem any fuller than usual, but it really didn't have to be. The hop flavors seemed to sink into the maltiness a bit more, and it was much rounder and incredibly drinkable!

Not a huge head for so much hops and isn't lacing this glass which seems to always happen when I use the dishwasher so it's not the beer. Smells like citrus, pineapple, and some other weird fruits. Smell is also a bit like grain alcohol. Tastes a lot like what I remember DFH 90 minute IPA was like. Hops have mellowed a bit with age but they are still there in spades. I can now taste a bit of the pale malts in the the middle. They are actually quite good. Mouthfeel is heavy for such an innocent looking beer. Hmm. I don't find this beer to be highly drinkable.

A creamy white head an inch plus thick that leaves nice lacing until your beer is done. A really unique orange citrus colour.  a light fruity, floral aroma. Citrus is predominant.  Initial taste is hoppiness and fruit juice even a little lemon as it washes over the tounge. An acidic zing in the aftertaste, kind of like a bitter lemonade.  incredible drinkablity.

Smell is that of faint malt, caramel sweetness. Hops figure (obviously) promanently in the aroma as well. A very strong grassy, earthy, citrusy hop aroma. This smells pretty darn good. Wow, for the smell, I was expecting this to be a lot more bitter than it actually is. Oh, don't get me wrong, it's definitely hoppy as all get out, but it's not really ""BITTER."" Fruity (citrus, sorty of white winey), caramel, toasty malt, and hop flavor dominate. There is also a very slight warming sensation as this one makes it's way down. Overall, a wonderful example of a DIPA. I would say my only qualm with this one is the mouthfeel, it's a little slick for my tastes, but still a damn fine beer.

The alcohol really doesnt let the hops shine through like they should in the style. Taste is very similar with citric and earthy hops being big up front. The alcohol unfortunately is a big part of the taste, and not in a good way. Mouthfeel is about average with ok drinkability. I was expecting a lot more of this when it came out after the rave reviews last years version had. This one fell short and I regret buying a case before I tried it. When it was fresh the same problems stood out so I gave it some time and it still seems to have an overpowering alcohol presence.

The taste is citric hop bitterness up front, some piney notes ( not as prominent as some other IPAs), and a spiciness that I normally associate with pilseners and Saaz hops. Very nice. The finish is relatively dry with a light but lingering bitterness and a soft alcohol warmth. This is a very good session beer, but not the enormous hop bomb that typically defines the style.

This is one of the few beers that I have ever poured out for any reason other than being too drunk to finish it. The sticky-sweet canned pineapple taste is overwhelming, and nearly made me retch right there, but then the hops came rumbling in. Normally when I think of hoppy beer, I think of Sam Adams or Goose Island or Sierra Nev PA - a little harsh and painful on the jaw after drinking several, but overall well-balanced and non-offensive - they taste good. Hop Wallop doesn't have that kind of hop flavor. The hops are bitter, aggressive, and overall very nasty.

First swigs: Liquid hop lurking in the front with a malt back peeking out. 8.5% ABV is detectable. Sweet grassy pine notes. Bone dry aftertaste and tea leaf hop oil sizzle.  Feel is medium with sticky sweet hop oil but not quite a hop magnet. Plenty of sizzle.  Last swigs: Barely a double IPA. Forgo the ""last year"" hooey. This year is grass hops like 90 minute w/out the malt back. Kicked in $5 a pint at local Union Jacks.  Beer is good. Happy beering.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,AndIWantYou,4.52,"Smelled very crisp from the moment I opened the bottle. High-hop beers always seem to have a ""clean"" scent cutting right through any flavors I may have had in my mouth recently. The beer was a deep gold with a just-barely-offwhite head that lasted quite a while and laced firmly to the glass. On my lips I can taste the plant-like sweetness that I dislike in a beer like Dogfish's 120 Minute, but it immediately gives way to the biting, fresh taste of hops (wish I knew my hop varietals a little better). I can taste a citrusy flavor at the top of my mouth (but it's not oranges... maybe grapefruit? I don't know--I don't eat grapefruits). The beer fills my mouth without being too heavy or cloying, and the alcohol warms the palate quite a bit. Aftertaste reminds me of white grape juice with some of the sugar removed.  I really enjoyed this beer and will definitely buy it again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,budsboy,3.85,"Pours a cloudy light amber with a sticky white head.  Citrussy hop nose with fruity hints. Not nearly as hoppified as I expected.  Starts out hoppy enough, with a healthy dose of malty sweetness, then comes a hard-nosed, full-on grapefruit hop pounding. Ah, that's the wallop apparently. Cool.  Crisp on the tongue and oily at the finish. This beer seems to have two stages of everything.  Pretty easy to drink, but I wouldn't try pounding these down all day long.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,TheGipper,3.3,"Tasted a glass at the Victory event in NYC. I was looking forward to getting my hands on this ale, and I ended up somewhat disappointed. There was a lack of body, a thinness, which made the hoppiness evaporate after the first moments of sipping. Nice aroma, but the flavor just did not follow through. I'd call this more drinkable if it wasn't so high in alcohol. Not bad, but not what I expected.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,sprackops,4.75,"Presentation: 12oz brown bottle poured into a nonic imperial pint glass.  Appearance: Hazy bright orange with numerous bubbles floating up the sides to a moderately sized white head. Like carbonated apricot juice, as strange as that would be.  Smell: Mainly pine and sweet citric aromas. Yes, there are a lot of hops in this stuff. Despite the ABV, there is no scent of alcohol.  Taste: As advertised, hops are clearly in the driver's seat. Unlike other beers of the style, however, the malt content isn't relegated to the role of a mere hop juice delivery system. While I'd hesitate to call this balanced, the Wallop is the closest I've tasted in a double IPA. As to specifics, I was immediately hit by a huge grapefruit and pine needle flavor, no doubt courtesy of Pacific Northwest hops. There is an undercurrent of honey-like malt character, gently leading the imbiber to a bitter end.  Mouthfeel: Fuller bodied and creamier than the appearance suggests, as if it were an IPA crossed with a Belgian tripel.  Drinkability/comments: While I wasn't lucky enough to taste last year's version, which many claim was much better, I'd have to say this is the best double IPA I've had thus far. Over time I've had quite a few, and through intensive scientific analysis have concluded that it is very quaffable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Grassy and herbal, piney and unrelentingly hoppy. What a surprise. I swear I can almost see resins beginning to crystalize on the lip of the glass. The first sip is overpoweringly medicinal. Actually unpleasant. For me this wallop is way over the top, all out of balance. Although I love a good IPA, I suppose I'm not a hophead.

345,14916,Hop2it,4.65,"I'll put it this way, after checking this site for the last few months, Hop Wallop is the beer I decided to write my first review about. I like my IPAs the way I like my action movies. Big explosion in the very beginning, followed by an introduction of the individual characters and their qualities.  Beers like this I enjoy in a congac glass... maybe I just like the way it looks, but I swear it brings the smell to a point that I taste each drink before it reaches my lips.  The initial taste is so citrusy and bitter it 'hops' to the back of my tounge and lets those slow malty flavors catch up with the rest a second later.  Though Hop Wallop's head is rather thin, the lace of sip-rings around my glass reminds me of how each sip gets longer and deeper and more appreciated.  There's a lot of complexity here and I don't know where to start. I'm reminded of Weyerbacher's Hops Infusion, though I feel like this has more punch. I give it high marks for mouthfeel because it really tingles every part of my mouth from my lips to the back of my throat, like those tiny carbonated bubbles can't stop popping with hidden flavors.  Drinkability? Gosh there's very few beers I'd rather spend a night drinking, though one night this week after only 4 Wallops I decided to go to a bar to find something with a lower alcohol content. Sure, I can handel a 8.5% beer, but killing a 6pack would be a chore.  Blame it on my sense for immediate satisfication or on years of hot sauce abuse, but I get real excited about the spicy richness that IPAs offer. Victory really did a great job here... this is the big brother of Hop Devil and its name is fitting.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Appearance: medium fluffly white head that rests gently on top of the beer like a cloud. Good retention and massive lacing. Clear golden orange with a little chill haze.  Smell: Very citrusy hop smell, mild piney notes, with the malt in the background. Kinda spicy, but it could just be the 8.5% ABV that lurks within.  Taste: Starts with a very brief flash of sweet malt, and then the hops take over. Bitterness gradually gets stronger and stronger and stronger. Lots of citrus and piney hop flavor with an oily and resiny kind of quality. The flavor fades in the end just leaving you with an intense bitterness all over your tongue, comprable what you get after eating a high alpha acid hop pellet.  Mouthfeel: Light carbonation, but it has a full body. Leaves a drying and a very faint astringency.  Notes: Alcohol is barely detectable in the taste and combined with the light carbonation very drinkable. Definitely warms you up on a cold and rainy day like today. Extremely well balanced with the hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

Sweetish cookie malt backbone, with a very flowery, citric hop component. Taste starts with solid malt; cookie batter, and light toffee/butterscotch. Hops come on strong, with nice piney flavors at first, followed by a sharp acidic citrus bite. Wow. Finishes like grapefruit juice with some lingering malt and a warming alcohol groove. Medium-bodied, with a creamy feel. Good carbonation and a dry finish. Nice, but not the best DIPA I've had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

After reading here i might aggree to say grapefruit which probably comes from the Cascade? Very powerful though with some more citrus and huge citric hoppiness. Some prinkling carbonation in there. Huge hop oils together with powerful lemon and lime peel.  Taste comes on thick and bitter. Rich, somewhat prickly due to carbonation and citric. Lingers sweet on palatte to burst away a cascade of bitter traces and different malty feels like those of citrus, pine and grassy hay ;) Finishes soothing bitter and quite long lasting as well.  Extremely potent brew with lot of flavours. The smell came on quite funky in the beginning though, not to my liking.

Looked almost like an adjunct lager, but the yellow was a little more intense.  Smell was perhaps the strangest I've ever come across. I know it sounds bizarre but the smell reminded me more of canned pineapple than anything else. Not particularly pleasant.  Taste was strange, harsh and unforgiving. If that was hops, they were like no other hops I've ever had before.

Looks much lighter than most other IPA's. Floral aroma with some spice, cocoa, some grassiness, but something odd too - kinda like leather or horse stable? wierd. Taste is all hops of course. Lip smacking flavor but missing that piney oily taste. Its just citrus and clean hop bitterness. I was looking for something more complex. Alcohol hidden well. Mouthfeel is very smooth with stickiness in the finish. Yeah, I can drink this one all day, but I can drink a lot of beers all day. This double IPA is definitely good, but it's not amazing so dont get your hopes up that much.  Additional note: watch out this beer kicks your ass at 8.5% ABV.

On the tongue this ""very hoppy ale"" was full-figured, moist, and slightly dense, just like a good homemade bread. As the finish nears, a crushed aspirin takes over with hints of cough syrup alcohol. This tastes like cactus juice. It also tastes like one of the magic healing elixers I used to buy at the circus back in the 1870s. Overall funky, long-lasting, and pretty good.

Aroma if hops herbal, earthy, grassy type mixed with hints of floral undertones on top of a sweet malt backdrop make for a diffrent and intersting for a I2PA. Overall smell is little subuded compared to others but might have to due with the type of hops used. Taste is sweet and biscuit like malt before the hops take over. Grassy earthy flavors with some fruity pear like flavors also in the mix. Finishes with a herbal bitterness almost medicine like not bad. Overall tastey and diffrent not what I was expecting at all, doesn't live up to the hype but still is a good beer. Mouthfeel is creamy like but not as heavy feeling as others kind of strange to be creamy and little light at the same time.

They're like bonging a shitload of pine sap, grapefruit, then chasing with maple and/or brown sugar. Resiny, but sweet, mouth-raping little suckers, and we all love them.  Ok, so what the fuck is this then?  A maltiness that teeters between shortbread and graham crackers, then dries further to simply saltines. Yeasty breadiness kicks up in the middle. Fleeting anjou pear notions. Hops strike with a searing herbal bitterness that is far more German-seated than I was prepared for. Blisteringly peppery. Notions of lime rinds. Lightly tart. Rose petals and lilacs on the swallow. Just an obligatory wave towards pine. This has bitterness to spare, despite its lack of typical American Double IPA goo and resin.  Medium of build, with light but steady carbonation. It harkens closely to Rogue's Imperial Pils.  It's biggest assest is its downability.  I'm fond of it....but not in love.

If the writing on the bottle doesn't tell you what this is about, the smell certainly will. Aside from the overall sheer hoppiness of this, there is a clash of peppery and sweet flavors that pop up from time to time. The onslaught of hops seems to intensify from one sip to the next. This has quite the carbonated zip in the mouth, making for a surprisingly light refreshing beer, and frightening ease of consumption. If a person was jonesing for hops and got into a sixer of this, I could see knocking back the whole thing, in blissful overindulgence.

A little darker color would have pushed this up to a 5.  Didn't really smell hoppy, although it is the only real aroma present.  Super tasty in every aspect. No trace of Alcohol and the hops are under control but still dominate the palate and don't throttle you with bitterness.  Goes down smooth and creamy with a slight twinge that becomes a bit astringent toward the end.

The hops dominated the aroma but left some room for the malt to sneak in at the edges. Nice clean nose.  Again the hops came to the fore but those malts brought along enough sweetness to offset the edginess of the hops. The flavor was hops only the sweetness with a bitter hop finish that never blew the malts away.  This beer had a surprisingly medium to medium light mouthfeel.

Pours a opaque, straw orange, with moderate, lacy white head. Smells crisp, bitter, and appealing. Taste is just outstanding. Obviously, very well hopped, but still the taste is very well blended with he powerful malt to make this beer surprisingly sweet.

Nose is mellow and super-thick, with caramel and hops combining to a very sweet overall effect.  Taste, also, is very sweet and full of alcohol, but not syrupy like the nose. Sharp alcohol gives the brew a sweet and salty strength. Spicy in intensity. But the main characteristic of the taste, which was not foretold by the restrained fumes, is the choking floral hop mouthful, that has to be the ""wallop"". The mouth fills up and doesn't want to move, grating and grinding unprocessed hops.

Even giving it a major swirling you maybe get a teensy bit of white dusting that appears. Barely any carbination in the mouthfeel, which I love. Just can feel it when you let it sit on your tongue for a moment, but barely feel it for a quick sip. Nice. Can't really smell anything from it -may be because the location seemed a bit smokey, or because we just climbed a wall of a hill to sit down to this pint and there was still some frostbite going on.... Just some hoppiness floating out, but not extreme. Maybe this batch was getting towards it's end, seemed to be getting more mellow than the last I had... the hoppiness is there, but not bitey or intense, just mellow. Nice and smooth feeling, not really creamy, but it feels good and flowing. This is a good, easy drinker with such pleasant tastes and feeling to it. Excellent session beer for anytime of the year, easy one to kill a huge volume of!  Had this one during our mini pub crawl in Manyunk on one of the colder nights... First beer in the Ugly Moose.

Enjoy by April 28 '05  Pours out bright, light gold and sits foggy golden amber in the glass with a good sized, creamy white head. Fades to a light skim and provides a few lacings around the glass.  Smells of ripe tangerines, oranges and nectarines. Beneath the inticingly fruity hop aroma lies a rich bed of malts that provides hints of caramel and light doughy aromas. All is good.  Tastes lightly sweet up front with intruding bitterness from the get-go. Smoothed out bitterness holds out and brings up sharp hoppy flavors of orange, grapefruit and tingling pine needles. Apples sweeten the deal and pear skins mellow it all out. Red grapes bounce all around. Finishes well bittered with extra pine needles prickling the sides of the tounge and some lingering flavors of apple and grape.  Amazingly smooth and creamy in the mouth, smoothing out even more as the beer warms and is swirled. Carbonation is light and soft, a perfect match. Medium-full body, absolutely fantastic.  Very mellow flavors, especially for a DIPA, but simply well-built.

A nice, bone white head rolls up and clings stickily to the sides of the glass on the way down leaving sheets of lace. The body of this beer is perfectly clear, and truly pale, being a light straw-shaded hue of amber. The nose is nowhere near as hoppy as I wouldve expected. The hops that are there tend to be of the grassy variety rather than the typically citrus/pine aromas I was expecting. Picking up some doughy yeast on the nose as well as a somewhat annoying vegetal aroma. Once I taste the beer it does become a bit more interesting though. Nice sweet malt up front, the bitterness here is dense, but again out of something called HOP WALLOP Im expecting more. I do pick up on some of the citrus/pine PacNW hops in here but interestingly enough it does seem like some Euro hops are in here lending a spicy/grassy flavor. The alcohol only plays a tiny sweet note at the back of my throat, barely noticeable. Nice bitter and slightly dry after-taste. This is an interesting beer, with a nice hop complexity.

Very citrus-like in flavorings, with an absolute on-slaught of hops. Extreme on all ends, and the sweet department is no exception; has a candy like sweetness and the malt neighbor is there as it should be. Piney and citrus flavorings; grapefruit juice, orange and lemon notes are buried and burnt onto the palate; a massive hop based body that is too welcoming; a warming at 8.5% that can slap you from your stool.

345,14916,clvand0,4.3,This beer pours a golden color with a small head that doesn't stick around long and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is much more subdued than I expected. Lots of hops - floral and pine mostly. The flavor has a spicy tone and lots of hop flavors. Very nice. This is one of the nicest double IPA's I've ever had. Drinkability is great.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,oggg,4.43,"Thanks to IrishRedRock for this super IIPA  This beer pours a beautiful golden orange with a creamy white head of foam that sits pretty and leaves a clingy Belgian lace. There is a small haziness which I think could be chill haze. The aroma is refined. Not the huge hop aroma that most IIPAs have. This could be due to the bottle serving, as Alpine's Pure Hoppiness also has a relatively subdued aroma compared to the tap version. The aroma is sweet caramel, then some citrus rind. Good carbonation level. The hop bitterness is very smooth. It really sneaks up on you with its bitterness. In fact, this is probably the mellowest bitterness I've encountered in an IIPA -- on the opposite side of the spectrum would be Pliny and Ruination. It really doesn't torture the hop buds on the tongue enough. Columbus I would guess. More grapefruit and citrus. A little spiciness. Rich caramel and then intense biscuit add tremendous balance and complexity. Alcohol is noticeable but does not detract. Very very smooth. Full bodied. I need to get more of this brew!  Overall: Mellow bitterness, great complexity.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,nogoodreason,3.9,"Golden, completely clear with a bubbly, rocky head and steady champagne-like streams of carbonation.  Nose is grapefruit pith followed with fresh-cut grass and pine sap.  Body is grassy and piney with turbinado sugar sweetness and a finish of grapefruit. Some degree of malt evident, perhaps a pilsner malt backing? Ligering malts and a slightly citrusey bitterness round out the beverage.  This is almost one-dimensional. It's a nice dimension, and I'd be glad to have this around more often but it's lacking the malt back-bone and the body I'd expect from a DIPA or even from a IPA. The lable says it's a ""Very Hoppy Ale"". That's more acurate. It is damned easy drinking for a 8.5% beer.  Far from the exceptional ale it's made out to be, but still rather nice. I'm glad to have had it and I wish it was available more often.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,lackenhauser,4.52,Not too amber not too golden color. Little head to speak of but a good carbonation level. Nice big hop aroma-a great malty sweetness comes thru as well-very nicely balanced. This is one of those beers where the aroma is perfectly carried over into the flavor. A great big hop flavor but excellently balanced with the malt. Really a great pairing of the two. Wonderful body-velvety smooth. None of the pucker of some of the other American Doubles. A very drinkable beer. Take this over the Hop Devil any day.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,FranklinPCombs,4.27,"Although this beer has a rather lackluster appearance (alot less than I would expect from a beer with such a full flavor) other things make up for its defficiency in that department. The smell is strong with honey sweet pines and hops. Small hints of malt linger behind but are subservient to the hops. The taste is very sweet, and full, with a nice bitter back with hints of burn malts. The beer goest down very smoothly, totally fooling me into thinking it was your averate 6% ABV IPA type. I was surprised to see that it was as high as 8.5%. That boosts the drinkability points for this beer definately. Quite a beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,NEhophead,4.55,"12 oz brown bottle.  Foamy white head with very good retention. Thin and ringed lacing with great strength. Hazy golden0light orange in color with noticeable carbonation.  Pine, hop oils, and light bubblegum. Very pronounced and tempting hop aromatics.  Pine and bubblegum at first; vinous and very oily. The hop profile is huge but not as grainy and brash as other double hop monsters. A big bitterness that's followed by a citrus, pine, and oily aftertaste.  Medium bodied; smooth and mellow yet quite a mouthful of hops. For the style, this is a crisp and unbelievable well balanced ale.  Great flavor, well balanced, and at 8.5% abv this one packs a punch! For a double IPA this would make a great session beer if you're really into hops. Another great beer from Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,NJpadreFan,3.95,Hop Wallop  enjoy by may 4th 2005  Appearance- hazy orange with a decent frothy head. Smell- Very strong citrus hops. Grapefruit/ lemon/ orange rind citrus. Taste- strong grapefruit citrus hop flavor. Mouthfeel- very clean and smooth. An initial bitterness but your palatte will quickly adjust. Goes down well.  Overall- a very good ale that rivals Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Hop Wallop is a little stronger though.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,goodbyeohio,3.1,"I agree very much with the review two below this one.. Good if you're a hophead, danger if you're not. I'm not. Still, I'd like to say some positive things as well. The taste has been beaten to death, so let me take a crack at a new approach:  Advantages: More flavor and aroma than last year's batch. More fruity aromas and complexities to a rather overpowering taste. With a whole lot of imagination, you can pull different flavors out of this brew like orange and bread that were not as present last year.  Disadvantages: After you drink this, your palate is shot for the night. It is the hot sauce of beers. The lingering bitterness is a hophead's dream but the belgian man's nightmare.  It looks good, it smells damn refreshing, but the taste is a polarizing killer.  Victory rarely disappoints, and this is a novelty, extreme-specialty beer. I'm sure those for whom it was made will love it.. it's not my cup of tea.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Sammy,3.82,"Yes, bold. Pine. Some high alcohol. Sweet and citrussy lemon and grapefruit. A lemon and a white head. Dry bitter aftertaste.I've of course had it since, including 8 years later. A nice drinkability, despite the IBU. Not much retaned head. A classic.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Shiredave,3.7,"Pours a pale gold with a creamy white head and absolutely no carbonation. Head subides quickly with faint traces of lace spatterings.  Aroma is unique ; herbal and pungant but not the citrus and pine Ive come to expect from these hop exstravaganzas. Hop varieties to me smell German- a definate departure from the norm these days.  Flavor is obviously hop dominated and while this beer was only slightly below room temp., it was difficult for any malt to make its presence known. Faint and unimpressive sugary sweetness for a split second up front, but then husky grain flavor is the only evidence of barley I could find . More grassy and herbal hop flavors grab the tongue but then dissapear abruptly leaving a surprisingly mild bitter finish. This beer really lacks balance and screams for more malt and a higher ending gravity IMHO.  The most interesting thing about this beer is the lack of overwhelming hop bittering at the finish. Most of the hop character is found in the flavoring and sharp bite before the swallow. I would be interested in the hop varieties used as this beer is quite different from the plethora of Double IPA's available lately.  A nice beer and a different twist on a "" new"" style, but I dont get all the hype. Give me a Hop Devil anyday over this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,xforce,3.7,"good beer, although a bit strong to drink a lot. golden straw like in color with a nice white head, about 3 fingers from a fairly aggressive pour. hops are good in the aroma: piney, grapefruit. high bitterness levels, with a strong sweetness from adjuncts (seemingly lots of them, like corn sugar or something). good beer, but i think i liked it better last year.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,beveragecaptain,4.23,"Pours a clear golden hue with a terrific looking large, white head and lots of lacing. Grapefruit aroma along with loads of hops. The taste is sweet and hoppy. Little malt flavor, but plenty of hops. Bitter finish. Medium to full mouthfeel. Oily feeling in the mouth. High level of carbonation. At 8.5%, the alcohol is very noticable. Flavorful, but not complex. A good choice if you love hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,necoadam,4.28,"Poured out an orange/dark gold color with a decent size head that left a good about of lacing around the glass. Wasn't cloudy at all, I could see through the glass.  Smell was all hops. Lots of pine aromas along with a good dose of citrus aromas. It's a bit on the sweet side, but nothing to complain about. A hint of grapefruit and orange hangs around in the background.  Taste was good. Lots of flavors, but oh so subtle and soft. My kind of Double IPA. Floral, citrusy, juicy hops attack the palate, but again, it's soft, but very flavorful. Malts come in the middle and balance it out pretty good. Finished with some piney flavors.  Mouthfeel was very good in this beer. It was very soft and gentle on the palate, and quite smooth and creamy. Carbonation is controlled.  One of the better double IPA. Everyone should try this beer once.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,maltedmilk,3.92,"The beer pours clear and golden with a beautiful white head. The first smells are interesting , a little fruity.

Citrusy, fresh cut grassy hoppiness with hints of lemon, orange and grapefruit.  First sip is a nice shot of citrusy, grassy/piney hops. A swirling blend of orange and graperfruit notes dance across my palate before the biterness hits on the back. A nice caramel biscuity malt attempts to break out through the hops. Yummy.  Mouthfeel is nice with a creamy texture...but a little thin for me. I look for a bit more body in my double ipa's. Drinkability is excellent...a tasty brew that I could easily make a session out of.

Where to start? First of all, I cracked this beauty at about 57 degrees. And damn, the oiliness leaps onto the tongue and just hangs there with the viscosity of warm tupelo honeyis there any other? Grapefruit rind hoppiness is big and bold. There may be a hint of malt here, but I think it is just a fuckin hop in disguise.

345,14916,ZAP,3.88,"The first bottle I had was after a few Bitter Woman's and Celebration's and I thought the hop load was disappointing..I opted to not review that night for fear of a blasted palate and that was probably wise...this has plenty of hop goodness to it...not the most amazing creation on earth but enjoyable...bottle says best by April 05...  Pours a very clear, light yellow..nose is pungent...leafy...tobacco..canibus...flavor begins sweet and floral..backed by almost a candy like sweetness..the long finish has a good hit of piney tight hops...body is medium..perhaps on the lighter side of medium..for a DIPA this is not particularly hefty (which is OK by me)...

345,14916,skybluewater,3.52,"Pours an utterly standard gold color. Fair amount of lacing. Smells hoppy, natch, mostly pine and grapefruit. Taste is the same, very hoppy, with mostly bitter grapefruit flavors dominating. Alcohol is quite present.  I hate to say it, but I'm not impressed with this beer. It's just too bitter, but not in a lipsmackingly good way. I won't be buying this one again.  I love the label though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,HogHill,4.17,"Bought a case of this as I didn't want to miss out on this seasonal brew, and it appeared that it was quite limited last year. Label says enjoy by April '05.  From the bottle it pours a light golden body topped by a thin white head. Side by side comparison shows it lighter in color to its Hop Devil sibling which is more amber.  This brew smells like a what it might be like to be lost in a hop forest. From the first whiff I can tell this is a double IPA.  Taste: Malt, not so much, hops -&gt; ummmhmmm. Considering the high ABV of this beer it doesn't taste like that, and that's a good thing. I am a big fan of Victory's Hop Devil and this is like Hop Devil that's been brewed at BALCO. JUICY!  Overall, it is a very enjoyable beer and I would order this first if I saw it on tap 4 out of 5 times, but I don't think I would want to drink more than 2 pints of this brew as far as drinkability goes.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,WesWes,4.67,The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a pale malt scent along side of a kick ass hop aroma. It has an intense citrus hop aroma. The taste is perfect. It has a rich pale malt flavor with a very bitter hop aftertaste. It goes down easy and finishes smooth. The mouthfeel is excellent also. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. It has awesome flavor and aroma; a good drinker.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Stimack,3.9,"Had this on tap the other night while at Mahars. The brew poured to a cloudy golden color with a nice thick head that left light lacing through out the brew. The aroma is over the top with Hop! Holy cow, the people with me could smell the hops and they where across the table! The aromas are of pine, grapefruit and lemon with a light alcohol smell. Not a bad smelling brew but probably has the most hop smell that I have come across yet. The taste is similar to the aromas, the hop flavors knock you for a loop and I cant say that I picked up much of a malt flavor, but did notice a alcohol type after taste. All I can say is that I am glad that this was my last offering of the night because for the next few hours all I could taste was hop residue! A good brew, but not completely what I am looking for.

345,14916,TagoMago,4.6,"Presentation: 12 oz. bottle, poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance: A beautifully clear and clean looking beer with a radiant golden hue. Pours with a very healthy, lasting head, producing a fine lacing on the glass.  Smell: Citrusy hops dominate the beer's aroma, with notes of pine, lemon and some clove.  Taste: Moderate carbonation with a medium but clean mouthfeel. Up front, the taste buds are nicely assaulted with an intense hop blast of piney, citrus overtones. This is balanced out with a biscuity backbone and finish.  Overall: This is an amazing double IPA -- one of the best American double IPA's available. Drink with care -- 8.5% ABV.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,counselor,3.5,"Hop bomb baby - pours a blend of straw and copper, decent white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is pine, grapefruit, hop resin. The mouthfeel is a little this for a beer this high in alcohol and there is not nearly enough malt to create a balanced beer that i could drink more than oen or two of. Any malts present are totally drowned out by the stinging hop flavor. The hops linger way after the beer goes down and almost presents a heartburn aftertaste. I had last years edition in a trade and the beer semed less ""green"". Never the less, this beer is as advertised and is a definite hop wallop",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Stingray5,4.72,"Enjoy by Apr 28 05. Nice and fresh. Pours an incredibly clear amber-orange with a white head on the fizzy side. Serious raw flowery hop aroma. Wow on the hops here. I'm trying to judge the mouthful but hell, the massive hops are too distracting. Citrus hops - orange, lemon, with a sweet malt backbone. I read all about the hype on this so I made it a point to stay objective, and I gotta say, this is very tasty. Don't drink it too fast though. Savor this one a little. Nice alcohol kick livens things up even more. Hop burps galore. A palate killer if I've ever had one. I'm going back and buying a case.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,krberg,3.14,"Slight copper tinge with a huge white head. It could be mistaken for a german pilsner.  Citrus hop smell. Smells good but not really the over-the-top hop aroma I had been expecting.  The first sip is weird. Citrus acidity with bitterness, no real malt character. The second sip reveals the backbone, but with a very apparent bitterness. By the third sip I can find more malt sweetness, but the hop never fades. Very unbalanced and one dimensional. The alcohol is well hidden though.  A bit thin for a regular IPA, nevermind a double.  I think I would get burned out on this beer after a couple (or maybe this one).  I LOVE hops, but I also love character. Ultimately, hop wallop is a boring hop-bomb. Worth the experience, considering the hype, but I wish I had bought a single.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Dithyramb,4.53,"Presentation: 12 oz brown bottle with the interesting cartoon. Purchased with a few other seasonal brews while on a recent trip up to Wells Discount Liquors. Currently on sale for $8 a six pack.  Appearance: Pours a slightly tarnished golden color with a healthy off tan head. Creamy, sticky lacing was evident throughout.  Smell: Smells super hop oily, with green hops and pinecones.  Taste: Dont be fooled by the name, this is an intense, but wonderfully complex, beer. It isnt one-sided and extremely hoppy, but has a sturdy malty body that exists as a firm biscuit undertone to the hops. And the wallop is there too. Pine, citrus, and alcohol esters mix with the bready malts to sooth over your mouth.  Had a medium body with a finish like a fine extra virgin olive oil. Not bitter and astringent, but smooth and creamy, without any acidic after thoughts.  Notes: Yet another amazing beer from Victory. Even more amazing is that it lived up to all the hype Ive seen on the site. I almost didnt buy it, thinking that it was an overwhelming hop explosion that would burn my taste buds dry for days, leaving me a beer-drinking shell. This is a wonderfully crafted beer and would go extremely well with food (had mine with pierogies and with nachos), with other beers, and as a session. I will be pained to save any in the cellar without drinking them all.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,GCBrewingCo,4.25,"The beer poured crystal clear pale golden with an off-white head which was frothy and moussy and both coated and laced the glass.  The aroma was grassy, citrusy and floral hops. Dry hop aroma was most prevalent. As the beer warmed and the head fell the malt presence was noticeable behind the hop presence.  The flavor was hops. The hop flavor was well balanced with malt and the bittering was well accomplished. The hop presence was citrusy and grassy with that same floral component in the background for good measure. The hops and malt could not hide the alcohol which is the only detractant in the flavor.  The finish was just dry with lasting hop bittering, grassy and citrusy long into the aftertaste. The body was medium full and well done, the alcohol was a bit on the hot side and left more than a warming impression, almost a burning sensation in the throat. The alcohol does detract a smidge from the flavor, but not from the drinkability. Burn baby burn...  12 ounce bottle. Enjoy by May 04 05 on label. Nice to see a beer made with mainly malt, a bit of crystal, and a ton of hops. It is not the most complex beer I have had, but a clear beer with higher alcohol, and nice hop presence deserves a decent rating.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,asabreed,4.49,"Considering the limited availability and the notice from Victory about the importance of aging, I figured I should finally get a case since I missed out last year.  Appearance - I was expecting more, honestly. From what I've seen in the past the appearance doesn't rank as high as I wanted. Not as hazy as I was expecting, and the head was fairly thin and white. Still pretty good, though.  Smell - Beautiful. Fragrant hops and mild bitterness. A field of flowers.  Taste - Extremely delicious. Smell carries over into the taste, and the bitterness is the perfect compliment to how flavorful the hops infusion is in the beer. Everything is better as it warms, and I'm curious to crack one open at cellar temperature next time. Alcohol is also not evidenced very well; it's hidden in the beautiful balance.  Mouthfeel - Definitely nothing wrong with it. Coats the mouth in flavor. Not too carbonated. Great overall.  Drinkability - I gave the drinkability a 4 for some good reasons. At 8.5%, clearly you don't want to make it a session beer. It's also so good that it needs to be sipped and had very slowly to really enjoy the flavors as it warms. Then again, it's so tasty that it's hard to only have just one.  I paid about $32 for a case. I recommend a purchase for sure if you're a fan of hoppy beers or IPA. I can't wait to see what happens over the next few years as I keep it in the cellar.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,cracker,3.91,"Ok so I finally got my hands one of these after missing out last winter in its debut (and all the hype). Not sure how it compares to last year's version. But here it goes.  Pours a golden yellow-brown. Nice head. The smell is of the bittering hops and not so much aroma/flavoring hops in my opinion. I think this beer is bittered with chinook and/or maybe columbus hops. I don't really appreciate any cascades in this one. I feel the beer's hop presence is slightly overwhelming. Very little malt backbone if any at all. Taste is a bit stringent for my liking.  However, I felt the beer's drinkablity markedly improved as it sat in the glass for 10-15 mins. I suggest not drinking this ice cold but perhaps closer to 50F or so.

345,14916,tomthumbsblues,4.1,"This beer pours a nice bronze or honey hue, and from an aggressive pour I was able to get a 2-finger thick frothy head. There was good lacing as it went down the glass. The smell was sort of spicy, and a sort of apple-like hop aroma. The taste again, reminded me of apples, but was mostly a bittery hop citrus flavor. I think I also detected the slightest hint of malt too, but maybe I'm wrong. The mouthfeel was very well-balanced and had a definite hop aftertaste. My verdict: even though I'm not a hophead I still thought this was a pretty good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,WilliamPhilaPa,4.5,"Pours and looks much like HopDevil although I did not do a side-by-side comparision. Gentle fruity aroma of spruce, pine, and citric peels.

Great brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Lafe,4.53,"This beer pours a beautiful amber color, which completely belies the complexity behind it. From appearance alone, I expected something much simpler. The aroma of hops wafts from the pint glass as I pour this beer, but again, it only hints at what I'll find within. The aroma actually falls short of predicting the hop flavor I'll find here.  Upon tasting, this beer makes itself known. The hop flavor is astounding. You wouldn't expect this much hop flavor after seeing the clarity of this brew, nor sniffing its aroma from a pint glass. Bitterness is high to medium, and the malt support is adequate... meaning that hops dominate from start to finish, without being so over the top that I couldn't drink it at all.  Being a hophead, I could actually drink these all day. Wow, what a beer! Drinkability scores high here, simply because the bitterness behind this one is one to crave. I would compare it to what I find in Tupper's Hop Pocket, with a slight advantage in taste, but a major disadvantage in price.  You'd never know the alcohol content of this beer from the taste. The hops mask the alcohol nearly completely.  The price on the six pack is a bit high for the budget conscious, but I'd be way disappointed if I passed it up on that reason alone...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,smcolw,3.85,"This is a very powerful beer--high in alcohol and VERY high in hop. The on-tap version pours slightly cloudy, golden with a nice head.  The aroma is largely flowery hop. My daughter thought it smelled like oatmeal...hmmm, I don't think so.  Flavor wise, you better like bitter, bitter beer. The hop is overwhelming. The only way I knew there was malt was from the alcohol and the color. The beer is surprisingly rich given the flavor. The carbonation is expectedly high as a balance to the richness. I would not categorize this beer as ""drinkable"" simply because it lies on the outer extreme of an extreme category.

345,14916,freed,4.01,"I tried this the other day in the midst of a cold and didn't think it was that strong despite other's insistence. Now I'm cleared up and ready to review.  Pours a bright golden that has a color gradient to a deeper almost bronze in the core. It shows amazing clarity and a mild fizz of foam that stays for the entire beer. Excellent lacing though, and a rather attractive drink.  The aroma is unique, I'll give it that. While some Imperial IPAs have heavily refined hop aromas that combine only the best, this seems short on the good hop aroma and leaves only a fermenting grass smell.  The taste starts as being a bit brash in its hop load, though a second, third, and even fourth sip are needed to acclimate the palette of this hophead to the bitterness of the wallop. The hop combination dominates the taste, though there is some sweet maltiness once my saliva has returned my mouth to a hospitable environment. It seems that refinement of hops that hurt the aroma does have some downsides in the taste, but the bitterness profile is unique enough and interesting in its own way that I'm curious how each sip is going to taste.  I'm really torn about how to rate the drinkability because this isn't a beer I'd want a second of unless I was planning on getting blotto and I didn't plan on consuming anything else for taste. But assuming that the serving is just 1 bottle, its right on.

Poured into the glass, this is a slightly lighter orange than the typical IPA, a tiny pure white head lasts for a minute then is gone ,leaving minimal laceing. A most pleasant aroma from this one, very aromatic and hoppy.Quite fresh or so it seems.  Taste? 100% hop juice!!,very bitter aftertaste, though now and again flashes of sweetness and malt show through, despite thehigh alcohol volume, it really is not noticed.

345,14916,Hibernator,4.74,"I had this out of a 12 oz brown bottle and served in a British imperial pint glass. Enjoy by date clearly marked for April 26 2005. This beer is a freshy.  The aroma on this beer is phenomenal. Strong whiffs of citrus fruit (grapefruits, oranges, and limes) and balsam fur pine.  Clearish yellow, light orange color. Nice sticky lacings cling and stay all over the glass.  Medium bodied with a really smooth mouthful. Again, pine and citrus are blending together to create a sweet and bitter combo. Sweet and crisp with a major hop bite.  Incredibly drinkable at 8.5% ABV. This beer is a treat and one of the best double IPA's I've had.  Recommended. I'm so glad this beer just began working its way into Boston. This is one masterpiece of an IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Gavage,4.45,"Crystal clear orange yellow in color with a nice 1.5"" fluffly head. Numerous slow rising tiny bubbles make this look over carbonated, but it isn't at all. The aroma is of piney hops, grass, and mild malt. The flavor is strong on the piney dry hop tones, but the malt is just right to balance this out. Some grapefruit and alcohol are also noticeable.  The mouthfeel is crisp at the start. The finish is crisp and dry with the strong bitterness lasting long on the tongue. Medium bodied which makes this an exceptional beer to drink. Very easy to have a few in one session.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,sideshowrob,4.57,"It's hard to provide an unbiased review of a beer that has been so massively hyped, but here it goes:...  Wallop poured out of the bottle a shockingly pale, unassuming golden yellow-amber color, not entirely unlike the hue of the mass-market stuff. Hops note was present in the smell, but was also very reserved - nothing to indicate this was more than a run-of-the-mill pale ale.  The taste was magnificent. Such a purity in mission and flavor is rarely seen. Brew appears to get all of it's flavor from wet-hopping, and all of that wonderful brewed-in bitterness. Not a hint of the hoppy-sweet flavors the massively dry-hopped beers tend to get (DFH 120...). This brew appears to have been brewed from the pure essence of a massive IPA. Only brew that can compare in wet-hopped bitterness would be Stone's excellent ruination.  Mouthfeel was again good, but nothing to write home about. Cabonation was correct for this brew. Wallop was extremely drinkable, and the high ABV was totally hidden in the flavor. Not sure if the malt-heads would agree, but this is a brew that should be savored, but can be quaffed like a session brew. Very, Very nice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,brewnut11,4.42,"Hop Wallop pours out of the bottle in a clear pale light orange color, much like your average IPA with a nice white head. The aroma is of a pine tree (a good pine tree on a cold evening). It has a strong bitterness, piney/alchol....very tasty for hop lovers. Hop flavor is good but the bitterness is what hits you and sticks with you. Carbonated on the high side for an IPA which adds a nice touch to the high hop bitterness. A great tasting beer to start off with or enjoy one or two an evening. Living in the northeast (about 50 miles from Victory Brewing) I was never able to get my hands on this beer untill now. It lived up to it billing. This beer only comes out in the fall and I would get a case every fall.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Erix,4.22,"Appearance: Definitely not what I expected from a double IPA. Looks more like a pale ale. Pale gold in color, with a somewhat rocky head. Quite clear, with no sediment at all. Smell: A lot of piney alcohol, somewhat gin like, but not in a bad way. Malt comes through rather subdued. Taste: Pure hops at first, but in a rather clean if piney and peppery way. Still not as much malt body there as I would expect, but more substantial than the color would have led me to believe. Alcohol is also there, but more as a lingering heat. Better on tap of course, but still good. Mouthfeel: A more substantial body would have served this beer well, but it still caused me to reconsider how I conider a light colored beer. Drinkiability: The farther into my glass I get, the higher I want to rate drinkability. This is most likey due to the strenght of the beer, but I've gotta give it some points for that.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jvajda,4.32,"Appearance: Good golden orange color and modest head. Smell: It smelled of bug fruity, cascade hops. I was very impressed. Taste: Big and mighty hop explosion of fruity sourness and deep bitterness. Although not as intense as DHF 90 Minute IPA, it still a monster beer. What most impressed me was the finish was far less salty than other DIPA's. Very good. Mouthfeel: Not as creamy as I'd like, but good. Drinkability: It's great to finally try it, and I'll definitely be trying more of it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,99bottles,4.16,"Appearance: Clear golden peach body. Moderate carbonation. A loose foamy head of 2 inches with minimal agitation in the pour. Nice overall look.  Smell: Not really strong, this has subtle smells of fresh hops, dried flowers, freshly cut grass, some light tropical fruit.  Taste: This is a delicate ale, not a hop soup like Ruination or Dreadnaught. This has a real dry malt base, with little residual flavors from the sugars. The 8.5% abv is very well concealed, and this drinks very lightly. The hops impart little in expressive flavor; rather, they only contribute their own real taste. This tastes like fresh hops, raw and green, fresh from the plant. These don't even taste cured, they don't give the multitude of flavors that hops can create. Fresh cut grass, perhaps some pineapple and orange, not quite as much ascerbic grapefruit of others but some. This finishes with a marked bitterness; it's obvious that some high alphas were used. Overall, I like this very much. It's much more approachable than most DIPAs, and I could actually drink a few of these.  Mouthfeel: Light for such a big beer. Really delicate, nicely put together. Not cloying at all.  Drinkability: This is the most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. This isn't so noisy that it can only be had in a single serving. I really enjoy this, and even though it may not be last year's groundbreaking version, it's still very good and a great departure from the sloppy ""let's throw everything in except the kitchen sink "" DIPAs that have recently come into fashion. A nice accomplishment.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BeerBuilder,3.53,"Light copper in color with a creamy white head, that leaves good lacing. The aroma is...well, hops. Citric, slightly fruity...maybe a hint of grapefruit. There is malt, but it is so overpowered by the hops you can barely detect it. The flavor is light in malt, then it hits you with the hop bitterness. I really can't even taste the hops, it is just a burning hop bitterness in the finish...it burns your throat going down. It has an alcohol warmth toward the end, but it is a drying bitterness in the finish. It is an ok beer, a little one sided, could use some malts to balance it out....but I suppose they were just trying to shock you with the hop bitterness.  It is overrated in my opinion. If you like just hops then this is your brew, but if you like a bit more complexity...then pass.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,kegerator,4.87,another great Victory Brew. Poured a slightly copper yellow with a half inch head that fizzled down quickly. Smell was all hops nice grapfruit citrus smell. taste was smooth and citrusy up front with a nice dry hoppy finish excellent brew and dangerously drinkable as far as the alcohol being masked. its very hoppy and hard to drink more then two of thesee in one sitting though,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ADR,3.54,"Clear as a bell, pale amber color at best, lighter than I expected (it also seems to look different than what I've heard about last year's batches). One half inch of fluffy white head of good duration. Spidery crystalline laces. Prickly aroma, hops give a mixed fruit impression -- almost like Juicy Fruit gum. Carbonation is more or less subdued, mouthfeel on the lighter side of medium. The briefest of malt hinted at by the aroma is quickly beaten into submission by an ongoing hoppiness that expands in impact, quickly moving from rind of cantelope to a burnt candle wick by the time the aftertaste kicks in. The 8.5% ABV seems moderately hidden but is noticeable. The overall statement seems clear, unidimensional, not that interesting, and a little overhyped. Yeah, its a blast of hops. What a SHOCK in American brewing...NOT...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,santoslhalper,4.48,"Pours a clear, champagne looking beer. The head monstrous in its size, and it doesn't go away. Smells very piney and hoppy with a mostly an alcohol back. Tastes much less bitter than expected. Very hoppy with a nice dry back. Aftertaste doesn't stop. This another great offering from Victory. They are quickly becoming my favorite American brewery. This is another gem in the Victory line-up.

345,14916,marburg,3.73,"Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a hoppy beer. That started with these Vic'try guys and finished with me here. The hops were a piney, mighty force, the look was crystal clear. My palate suffered bitterness shock, on this super hoppy beer, this super hoppy beer.  The drinking started getting rough, with no little to no malt. My frail little tongue was spent, and ruined my next alt, ruined my next alt.  The aftertaste took refuge in every corner of my mouth -- the piney hops, grapefruit too, the herbalness, with head so white, the bitterness! the fragrence and dryness here on my ruined palate!

Nose is very pungent and fresh hop aroma. I'm sure I smelled some malt in background there too. The taste is a blast of floral yet very very bitter hoppiness, with some malt sweetness popping in briefly, then some walloping alcohol flavor takes the stage. Light biscuity malt notes appear quickly as well. Finishes...well let's just say if you love hop bitterness, you're gonna love the finish on this ale...just long, long, long! A bit of fruitiness is sensed before being whisked away by the dominating bitterness. Very good!

345,14916,Suds,4.23,"After reading a lot about this beer, I was excited to finally get a six-pack and try some. It pours an extraordinarily clear, light-orange color with a notably thick, foamy, white head. Great lace. The aroma is not exactly what I expected, but an intense citrus, orange-like, fruity, peppery smell. The citrus-like character is present in the flavor as well, with serious grapefruit and lemon. Its also very well balanced with a nice maltiness. Its bitter from the first sip, and the finish is amazingly long and lingering. Its moderately carbonated, and has a solid, full mouthfeel. Hops are certainly the centerpiece, but I was impressed with how well they are balanced. Overall, I thought that the beer was solid and very drinkable, but probably not quite up to the hype.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

On tap at the Moan and Dove in Amherst, MA...thanks guys? This brew is just plain hoppy and dry, dry, dry....it dried my upper palate like a shot of whiskey and did the same down my throat. The only thing less than spectacular was the smell, which was still superb. It poured a medium gold with great lacing. Citrus hops were evident in the smell. The taste of the hops were there from start to finish...great!!! Mouthfeel is dry, dry, dry...I loved it!

The appearance is OK, but it is a little muddy, and the head did not last as long as I remembered. The aromas of this years batch were very subdued and even a bit malty. Where are all the fresh citrusy/piney hops!? They have been replaced with the aroma of ""hot"" alcohol! The taste is also not as I remember it....where are the hops!? This brew is not very hoppy at all, in fact it is very boozy and quite malty on the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but a bit sharp and hard to handle. ""prickly"" one could say.

The beer pours an extremely clear straw yellow color with a frothy white head on top. A strong aroma of grapefruit citrus with notes of alcohol hovers over the beer.  Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is smooth and creamy on the palate. The flavor is mostly grapefruit citrus, but notes of pepper and bubblegum come through. There seems to be a dry malt in the background holding everything together. A citrus hop flavor lingers after each sip.  This is one smooth great tasting beer, however the strong hop flavor and higher alcohol flavor takes something away from the drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,heidelbeerg,3.7,Poured a pale color with a thick white head that retains well. Smell is sweet malts and grapefruit.

345,14916,oxmasterscream,4.85,"Appearance: Pours a very clear, golden copper with a thick, creamy white head that coats the glass on the way down.  Smell: Huge grapefruit aromas combined with some spicy and light floral hop aromas. After a while, a very subtle and gentle malt aroma began to show through; think pink grapefruit drizzled with honey. Exactly what something called ""Hop Wallop"" should smell like.  Taste: Right off, you're punched in the mouth by spicy, almost peppery hops and a bag of juicy pink grapefruits. That's followed by a beautifully subtle honey-sweet malt flavor, that combined with the pink grapefruit flavors is a knock-out. From there, you're left with a seriously solid bitter finish that coats the back of your mouth and throat and just begs you to take another drink. Near the end of the glass, the spicy part of the profile really stars to burn the crap out of your tongue and throat. Wicked stuff. So far, it's best in the bottle.  Mouth: The immediate feel is bright and crisp but within seconds of it touching your tongue, it becomes creamy, velvety and smooth. Perfect mouthfeel. If you take the time to enjoy this as you should, the high ABV isn't really detected until three quarters of the way through the glass, when a slight warming can be felt at the finish. If you drink it fast, you'd never realize the high ABV until you were finished.  Drinkability: This stuff is so good that you want one after another, even if it's a bad idea. I've been drinking it since it's been released and I can't seem to get enough of it. Seek it out while it's here (should be easier this time around).  Sidenote: I reviewed Hop Wallop on tap and gave it a lesser score; looking back, environmental interference was probably the reason - it's still amazing even with lots of sensory interference. To taste it's subtleties, it's probably best enjoyed in a quiet, peaceful, smoke-free environment.

On election night, a local pub who thoroughly cleans their beer lines weekly served this amazing beer quickly after it's arrival. I personally had a crew from work on hand to demonstrate and taste how awesome this beer is. They all agreed - very comparable to Stone RIPA or Doggie 90. I then tried it from a yellow beer bar (PJ's for those PA/NJ peeps) who could care less about the taste and you could taste the difference. May be a sucky beer line cleaning sanitation job...

Let me adapt a beermail I exchanged with a few BAs for my review. There were some things I liked about it: Apearance wise: I liked the deep golden ginger ale color. I enjoyed the carbonation I could see clearly rising up in the glass. Came topped with a thin white head. I found it very drinkable/high drinkability. Seriously. I wanted another one, but decided to wait for the launch to get another one, and then that never happened. Also, it hid the alcohol well.  There were some things that weren't awesome. One was the aroma. I took the glass in hand, went sniff, and thought: what is that smell? Not whoa, that's hoppy, or mmm, rich malt, but: what is that? Low aroma for sure. Some acidity it seemed. So I racked my brain, and thought: what acids do I like? Balsamic, cider, lemon. Well it wasn't any of those, and then it hit me: it smelled very faintly of barf covered up by sawdust. Sorry, I know that sounds horrible, but that's what I thought.  The second thing that didn't stand out was the body ...medium to thin. I guess I expected a bit more substantialness in the mouthfeel. And also, even though I could see some good carbonation, I didn't experience it while drinking.  But I'll be damned if it wasn't drinkable. The hops to me weren't overwhelming, they were more of that distilled hop essence that you get with these higher abv brews...sorta making up the whole beer. The malt was there, but the over-all essence of hops was the beer. There was some citrus and pine in the finish.

The first thing that struck me about this was the raw, herbaceous aroma. VERY herbaceous. Some of my BA colleagues on hand called my crazy, but I'll be damned if I didn't get a big dose of marijuana in the aroma. The taste is soooo hop bitter. Having recently been turned on to some of the West coast hop monsters, I really thought I would like this, but for me, it was all bitterness with no flavor. Listen, I like spicy foods, too, but I like the FLAVOR of a jalapeno, not just the capsacin. I felt the same way about this beer. The hops were raw, grassy, herbaceous, and aggressive. Strangely, I also detected a flavor that I could only classify as ""extra-sharp cheddar cheese,"" but I suspect that's the grassy-herbaceous thing. I also detected next to no malt, something that I want in my ""Double IPA."" The finish was long and lingering. Mouthfeel was fine, but drinkability suffers due to the bitter pill that this is.

A light hop profile to nose with some parallel notes of orange essence, clover honey, and a core of malt, though extremely subtle. On the mouth, sweet hop crank to start with other light notes really pulling through and making this double IPA a not-hop-bomb consisting of corriander, lemon grass, and light maple syrup.

Burst of pink grapefruit and lemon oil upfront in aroma yields to a melange of minty ethanol and toasted malt. Softens as it breathes, with tangerine and light toffee hints surfacing agreeably. Welcoming aromawise. In flavor, incipient is a brief snap of light caramel sweetness. This is readily overrun by a surge, then lingering plateau of quinine and citrus pith bitterness. Hop flavor is of juicy, ripe lemon and sugar sprinkled grapefruit. Marmalade impressions abound. Surprisingly bereft of evergreen notes, save a trace pine needle hint. Full bodied and nearly perfectly dextrinous without any syrupy qualities in mouthfeel. Finishes surprisingly soft, with butterscotch sweetened biscuit and candied orange hints lingering. A delicious DIPA heavy handed in citrus character, shy in pine, and functional in malt character. Superlatively drinkable and approaching balanced, even.

What can I say about one of the best brews ever brewed by one of the best breweries?  After looking cloesly at this 8 month old brew that was stored in a cooler I did notice a touch of chill haze. The physical stability of the beer was just on the edge. The color was still great. That's why I didn't give it a 5 for appearance.  The nose however was strong, bold, and was just like I remembered it when it came out the first time. This batch was defintely frist batch. Ron Barchet confirmed this by reminding me no second batch (the dry hopped version) was bottled exclusively.  The nose has hints of pine, grapefruit, and wonderful blended hops.  The taste was wonderful. It's mellowed NOT! It's still as bold, smack ya upside the head as ever. For those who love the turly hopped up brews, this one 's for you! Wow!  The mouthfeel was most pleasant and it is extremelty deceptive in terms of the ABV. No noticable alcohol burn on the way down.  3.5 for drinklability because of the ABV - this ain't no session beer!

The bottle had the legend of Hop Wallop printed in nearly unreadable font, but who buys bottles for light reading anyway, so I moved on to the main attraction. The body of the beer was apricot orange in color with a lot of cloudiness as a result of my preference of pouring the yeast in an IPA into the glass. The head on the beer was tall and crowning, and made it look a bit over carbonated. The head died down in a little while and left a lot of sticky lace on the sides of the goblet. The aroma was powerful green spicy hops with a solid caramel malt backbone. The taste was sweeter than I anticipated, with a lot of orange, peach, candied apples, and apricot fruitiness. The hop bitterness was quite subdued (which may have been the result of aging). The mouthfeel was soft and chewy and a lot wetter than most other beers in the style. There was some peppery spiciness in the aftertaste, but under the sweet coating that the beer put on my throat, it too was also quite secondary.

This is not a bad beer at all, but it is not an exceptional beer either.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,wyllder,4.17,"First off: Big thanks to BuckeyeNation for the chance to sample this brew.  Pours a murky golden amber with little to no head. Leaves plenty of sticky white lacing as you go.  Nose is fairly strong with grapefruit hops mingled with some damp-hay style muskiness.  First hit on the palate is more of the citrus bitterness from the nose. The bitterness backs off a bit on the midsip and that muskiness comes up center stage. Aftertaste is a jump back to the citrus bitterness again.  Overall, a solid offering from Victory. I think I still prefer Dreadnaught as far as DIPAs go, but then I haven't tried this fresh. I'll re-review when I do.  Wyll-",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.1,"Pours nicely; an initally well-bolstered eggshell-white head evaporates dissapointingly quickly to about a quarter inch of foam, although with significant clumping and tenacious crusting in the process. A handful of streamers mosey up through a dull, matte bronze-colored liquid; when held to light, copper highlights strain to shine around the edges of a glass murky with floating sediments. Served cool, the aroma starts by rolling up sharp and fruity (citrus: orange more than grapefruit), lingers with a body full enough to be called ""fleshy"" and nectarine-ish, and tapers off tartly. Too much body in the nosefeel to be called ""floral,"" but with warmth, suggestions of pollen and pine (minus the ""snap"" of pine) emerge. Flavor is deeply balanced, with sourish hops dominating over a rugged maltiness suggestive of brown or raw sugars. With time, hops get harsher, with a poignant, punchy bitterness high and at the roof of the mouth pushing maltiness first to the sides of the palate and eventually off the edge. A hint of clover, even? Mouthfeel is well-rounded, with hop flavor sticking smoothly, solidly to palate after each sip; lacks the ""shellacky"" quality of some of the other boundary-pushing IPAs. I'm ready for another, but I think more than two bottles in one sitting would be too much (in terms of both palate fatigue and alcohol content). This sample was six months old; I think that after aging, the beer's remarkable balance may have been achieved at the sacrifice of the initial flavors' intensities. I greatly look forward to tasting a fresh sample. Good stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,egajdzis,3.83,"Poured a dark golden color with a nice white head and beautiful lacing. Sweet, hoppy, citrusy aroma. Citrusy, grapefruit, sharp fresh hop taste with a smooth malty sweet background. Very full/coating mouthfeel. I enjoy this as much as I would Dreadnaught or Ruination. The 03 vintage rocks, the 04 however, sucks :(",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,JackTheRipper,5,"I had this one in the cellar waiting for a special occasion, and seeing 20,000 BeerAdvocate.com members seems like a special occasion indeed. A: Hazy golden amber in color. Head was initially about a fingers worth of a light tan suds, it's now about a quarter inch of a creamy looking foam. Some sediment is noted in the glass.  S: From this day forward, this is what will come to mind when I think of a Double IPA. Smells are a sweet grapefruity hop aroma at first. Not bitter in smell at all, but a solid hoppy aroma (I wish I knew what sort of hops they use). Nice malty bread smell underneath the hops. Brilliant.  T: Taste is a smart hop flavor that is surprisingly mellow at first, letting me get a nice feel for the malts used. There's a quick flash of a sweet flavor, but that gives way to a hoppy acidic twang that doesn't punch you, it seems to build on itself and grow into it's full hoppy glory. Finish is a long lingering sharp citrus flavor.  M: Super smooth, it's from a bottle but feels more like a cask conditioned. Full bodied, carbonation can't get any better, and the alcohol is nicely warming but very well masked.  D&N: As near to perfection in an IPA as I can imagine. I realize that five's should be rare, and this one got fives across the board, but I think that letting this beer age for a few months really let the flavors and aromas mature into a pretty perfect IPA. I've had many in bottles fresh from the brewery and they just didn't have the depth and character that this one does.  Edit to add: when this one comes out again, I'm thinking that putting a case or two in storage rather than two bottles would be a good idea. This beer rocks.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,jackndan,2.82,"Victory Hop Wallop: A twelve-ounce bottle, of a very hoppy ale. Its got a cute little spiel down the side about the origins of Hop Wallop. Pours a hazy color, with an extraordinary amount of suspended sediment (despite the fact that this brew has been sitting in the fridge without moving for a good month). Fairly nice head, leaves some diffuse Belgian lace down the side of the glass. Curious aroma, very strong aroma of hops, but there is a wee bit off smell here as well, almost ammonia.  Very hoppy beer, that is true, extremely strong hop flavors, but almost absent is any malt base. As bitter as an IIPA as Ive seen. Unfortunately, this beer is missing those floral/citrus hop flavors that really would have taken this brew to the next level. Leaves a slick feeling on the tongue, as it dries out the palate.  As it stands, it is a true hop bomb, and not a whole lot more. In addition, I am perplexed by the high level of sediment in this brew, I do not believe that Ive seen it in other examples of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,garymuchow,4.52,"Many thanks to goindownsouth for this sample.  I love the hop complexity to the aroma. Citrus (with a nice combination of sweet and sour), fresh, grass, with just a hint of malt base. None excessive, dominating or overpowering. Orange-yellow-gold amber. Half-inch steady head, fragmented lacing. Cloudy. Good looking. The first thing I notice upon drinking is how smooth it feels with a strong creaminess, but once past the lips the hops bit kicks in big time. It's a great contrasts of sensory experiences. Hops flavor is very reminiscent of the aroma, but isn't quite as complex. The citrus is more dominating and pushes overpowering. Nonetheless the grassy quality remains. Drink also begins with a short shot of malt sweetness that is really pleasing, but a little too short lived. Wonderfully smooth with really interesting and enjoyable creaminess. Carbonation adds a bit to the bite, yet somehow remains subtle. This is really very good. It deserves all the credit it's getting. Highly recommended for hop lovers. How does it hide the ABV so well?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,UnionMade,4.37,"The beer pours into the willibecker glass a hazy, autumnal gold, a gargantuan froth erupting with a rather gentle pour. The soapy heap slowly settles, bubbles of every size forming a rocky, craggy heap until finally resting in a thick, even bubbled coating atop the brew. A couple sluggish carbonation bubbles drift up languidly. Thick chunks of lace cling to where the head once was, spattered clumps clinging all the way down. A bit less lace than I was expecting, but it's possible that it could be my glass. Great head retention, never wavering, even through a grilled cheese sandwich with pickles and tomatoes towards the end. A small clump of head remains at the bottom of the drained glass, looking forlorn, yet sturdy and proud. The aroma is massively hoppy, as was expected. Pungent citrus conveys serious grapefruit juice, the kind you squeeze yourself, with a hint of biting orange and lime. Softer floral notes, suggestive of noble hops, create a gentler undertone. The vaguest touch of woodiness, perhaps oak chips? The malt lies buried within, struggling to bring my nose a toasty, slightly biscuity scent. Excellent esters blend with the hops, very fruity, with hints of pear, apricot and perfumey floral notes. An ever so slight touch of yeast fills the cracks. Vague fusel alcohol hides between the leaves of the hop colony that was sacrificed to fill my glass. The flavor starts with a surprisingly mild toasty malt, quickly overtaken by the monstrous juggernaut of hops. A bit of yeast is immediately apparent, lending body and a softening, slightly doughy flavor that softens the hops some. The esters readily apparent in the nose are more or less roadkill in the wake of this grapefruit monster. A hint of pear and flowers are easily detectable, some searching produces the scattered remains of some apricot. (Upon letting a warmish sip sit on my tongue, the fruitiness blooms, extolling ripe red apple and juicy peach) The citrus intensifies into the finish, becoming very pleasantly rindy and bitter, a bit of floral, noble hops adding complexity, serving to teach the strongarmed, crewcut citric hops something about charm, diplomacy and etiquette. Some vague woodiness appears in the finish with warmth, undetectable when the beer is below cellar temperature. Very pleasant, but I'm not sure if it's hops, the yeast, or actual oak conditioning. A bit of a pine needle bite right in the end, along with a dash of alcohol, warming the belly. The aftertaste is mostly piney, citric hops, simplifying into a sharp, nearly metallic bitterness, sticking to the tongue almost as long as it takes me to get around to doing the dishes. The body is surprisingly light, somewhere in the grey area between medium and full. A surprisingly smooth mouthfeel, undoubtedly assisted by the yeast, strolling along the palate with an urbane, gentle carbonation. A great double IPA from a great brewery. Perhaps my expectations were high, I assumed that the hype was at least partially unmerited, but it wasn't the best I2PA of all time. It is very distinct in it's hopping, and very, very enjoyable. The hops are excellent in the fruity, floral bitterness, but I could stand for a bit more body to back them up. The soft carbonation is awesome, though. They felt a hair too naked, kind of like a beautiful woman in revealing clothing. It's a fine line between seductive and trashy, and I feel like this brew's teetering on the edge, not sure where it wants to step. I did enjoy the lingering, nearly metallic aftertaste, but I can definitely feel the alcohol, particularly when this is the third beer in a session. Definitely make this the last one of the night, because you can't taste normal beer after a glass of the stuff. I'll certainly buy a six pack (or two) of this if it ever gets released again, but it'll probably take me a while to finish. I really do hope to see this again, preferably in larger quantities and maybe even outside of PA.

Apricot and citrus aroma, full of juicy pink grapefruit, spruce tree, floral. Very hoppy taste, hitting just about all the notes, citrus, floral, earthy, caramel and nutty notes as well. A bit peppery from the alcohol. Medium feel, a bit oily. Goes down smooth and quickly, I could probably go through a sixer if I had one. The bitter fruit-pit aftertaste sticks with you.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Gueuzedude,4.12,"Pours a slightly hazy, light copper color. The aroma is grassy, citrusy, with notes of bergamot. The taste is lightly sweet with an underlying toasted biscuit malt flavor. Of course this beer is hop dominated, but I like that I was able to get some maltiness up front. There is an astringent grassy note to the bitterness, as well as a resinous citrus/ pine hop note. This finishes with a solid slightly mouth-puckering bitterness. The key to to this beer is to drink it on the warm side of cool, so that the malt notes come out. Overall this is quite good, I just wish it was slightly more integrated, it needs a bit of smoothing out of the astringent notes. Still this is definitely a hop monster, and is a must try for hop heads.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

Waves of ample carbonation. Plenty of grapefruit in the nose. I also smell some sugar. The grapefruit persists throught the perfumey front. A sweet, juicy middle is full, giving up a little bit of rich malt with temperature. Finish is a puckeringly bitter hopsohol. This is one hoppy, bitter beer. The alcohol is warming, but really quite well hidden given the slightness of the malt. The beer sweetens nicely with temperature, but remains hugely bitter. When the occasion calls for hops...

345,14916,Boilermaker88,4.22,"Hop Wallop was one of the protagonists at my blind tasting of six imperial IPA's last night. Poured from a 12oz bottle, it had a hazy light amber color, lighter than expected, topped with a rather large and fluffy white head. Some very fine sediment remained in suspension. The nose was fruity-sweet, of dried apples and pineapples, with a hint of bubblegum and followed by a heady citrusy floral hops aroma. The taste had an initial grainy malt flavor that gave way to a candied fruit sweetness. This all didn't last very long before a rush of grapefruit juice and pine needles washed over my tongue and stayed there, refusing to move out. The alcohol content was very well concealed. The feel was medium-bodied leaning toward the lighter side, crisp and dry. Hop Wallop was a real departure from most of the other I2PA's at the tasting. It had a lighter, drier feel than all but Ruination yet maintained a greater balance of malt to hops. Yes, Hop Wallop has plenty of hoppy goodness but it isn't overboard or skewed to the detriment of the malt character. Hopefully, it can be seen out here come fall.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

The aroma of hops greets you first, then nice malt sweetness with a citrus like crispness to end it all. Start is sweet with a brilliant malt profile and the top is middling in its feel with the finish iron-willed in its acidity.

Sure to be a repeat offender. Not as fresh tasting as I was anticipating. Must be incredible on tap or cask. Thanks,Frank!  Edit 12/04/05: on tap at Sunset this beer is all about the freshness.

Flavor has some pale malt in there but it is hiding from the attack by the hop monsters, wow ! Flowery, perfumey, grassy and sweet hops lead a coordinated attack. Pure hop juice delight. Mouthfeel actually starts somewhat smooth and sweet but then the escalator of bitterness begins and doesn't stop until the penthouse. So bitter it made my teeth hurt.

Mouthfeel is full and creamy and envelopes the whole mouth leaving an orange peel tingle all around. Rings and webs of oily lace blanket the inside of the glass.

It persists for a very long time, eventually falls to a thick disk and leaves chunky lace in no discernible pattern.  Hop Wallop smells incredible! It's chock full of wall-to-wall citrusy hops that are more tropical than is usual for the style. This beer has one of the best noses (top 3 at least) of any of my 125 reviews. Candied lemon peel, grapefruit and passion fruit burst out of the glass and bowl me over with their magnificence. I just know that the flavor is going to be out of this world as well...  ...and it is. This is the closest--along with Ruination--to pure hop juice in a glass that I've ever had. Make no mistake, that's a good thing. This baby is one big, bold, intensely hopped DIPA, yet the bitterness is well supported. The IBUs must be off the charts, yet there's not a sharp edge in sight; nothing but pure, clean, intense hoppy goodness.  The hops are of the pungeant, piney, citrus fruity (grapefruit and orange) variety. Right up my alley in other words. The body/mouthfeel is impressively big as well. It's full, chewy, sticky, sappy and sweet; the better to hold the beer in close contact with my tastebuds all the way to and through a long, lingering, seemingly never-ending finish.  This is a beer to savor. It just begs to be drunk though and the bottom of the glass is fast approaching despite my best efforts to make it last. The hype surrounding HW was greater than anything that I've ever seen in my (still somewhat limited) time on this site. I bought into that hype since I love IPAs and I've spent a lot of time and effort trying to acquire this beer. Believe me, it was worth it. If you love hops, you must get ahold of Hop Wallop.  I owe a special debt of gratitude to gueuzegeek who provided me with this (my original) bottle. I also want to thank Dantes who made it possible for three more to find their way into my possession.

I had no idea this was an 8.5% beer until looking here. Drinkability was quite high, especially for a Double IPA. It definitely gives Two Hearted, Alpha King, and Celebration some competition, but all are excellent in their own way.

It is a beautiful hazy golden color with a large creamy white head with the usual IPA lacing. As a hops lover the aroma is ambrosia to me. The smell of hops is overwhelming. The taste is very small, however, with the hops bitterness as the first taste, but a real sweetness that balances the taste at the end. It is full bodied on the tongue with that great bit of hops oilyness. This is one Imperial IPA that I could become addicted to.

So I made contact with a couple of BA's offered some goodies I had and traded for the wallop(thanks francisweizen and beergeek for hooking me up). So I finish up with work today and a much much needed beer is what I had to have. So I go for the the smack in the face brew that's in my fridge Hop Wallop!!!

Appearance: amber-gold, nice modest layer of yellowish foam which slowly compacts, good clarity (if you handle the bottle VERY carefully... lots of loose sediment), really appetizing looking, nice lacing on the glass  Aroma: pine needles, grapefruit rind, grass, malt sweetness and a touch of strawberry fruitiness  Flavor: initial passion-fruit fruitiness then an oncoming grapefruit bitterness followed by rich malty relief, an acerbic bitterness dries it out to leave a pleasant hop-resinous aftertaste, slightly grassy, very well-balanced  Mouthfeel: medium-full body, low carbonation, quite astringent  Overall Impression: This bottle was courtesy of frank4sail, who brought it (amongst many others) to Belgium for me. Since I'm not a hop-head, I was a bit ""intimidated"" by this one. I thought it was going to peel the tastebuds off of my tongue like some of the other hop monsters in the US. It's actually a really nice beer. Super well-balanced and oodles of delectable flavor.

Close inspection reveals a colloidal suspension of fine brown particles. This is meant to be the &#8220;dry hopped&#8221; version of HW, so perhaps these are the artifacts of that process. A strong pour generated a sturdy, dryish white head that didn&#8217;t last quite as long as expected, resolving down to a modest skim with moderate lacing. Overall, a fairly rich, rustic appearance.  Smell: Very floral and surprisingly nuanced. I expected a bit of a giant-killer, but as this falls somewhere between some IPA&#8217;s and some monster Imperials, I guess this is to be expected. The expected mentholated pine and citrus elements predominate, but are leavened by some pineapple and lichee fruitiness and a touch of malt background. Vibrant but not harsh.  Taste: Confirms much of what the nose promised. The fruitiness is complex, balancing the heavy hop oil elements of pine and grapefruit. Definitely bitter enough to earn its classification, but not in a one-note way. The alcohol is well-integrated into the whole. Warming but not oppressive. The finish is full, but not quite as long as I expected.  Mouthfeel: Not quite as full-bodied as Dreadnaught or 90 Minute IPA. The carbonation is more lively and the texture lighter. I never had the opportunity to have this on draught, but I expect it might be flatter, thinner, and more bitter tasting without the hop percolation provided by the strong carbonation.  Drinkability: A very drinkable beer, almost achieving &#8220;session Imperial&#8221; status. Great value too.  Backwash: I&#8217;m writing this review after a lot of samples, because I wanted to have a complete picture. My first bottle (after much travail) was inevitably a bit of a let-down (how could it not be?). Drinking through many bottles over the last couple of months has allowed me to be more objective about it. So, let me say, this an excellent beer, bordering on great. First, this particular brew falls somewhere between the bigger Imperials like Dreadnaught and 90-minute and bigger IPA&#8217;s like Alpha King and Stone. I felt it was a bit less balanced than my favorites to date, Dreadnaught and 90 Minute. This probably edges those out in aroma, but is less flavorful and not quite as hefty in malts. That said, especially at $32/case, this SCREAMS to be added to the regular lineup (but begs the question as to why some other Victory brews are more expensive). I would buy this regularly if it were available.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,CBFanWish,4.17,"I often go to MacGergor's in Hennrietta to enjoy the atmoshere, the people and to try new beers. Yesterday was a great day for that. It was cold, rainy, and just plain gross. In other words, a great day to try a new beer or two. Vicitory Hop Wallop was the first beer I sampled. A hazy orange/yellow colour with a small, quickly disapating head, I was unsure what to think. But I know that a book can't be judged by its colour. The aroma was heavy on the pine and fruit side. A strong scent of citrus hit me as soon as the beer was handed to me. It was much like eating an orange in a pine forest. The taste was not as hoppy as I had expected, but it was wonderful. It followed the scent perfectly with a small, yet nice bitter kick in the end. It went down smooth for a very good all around experience. I will drink this again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ManekiNeko,3.65,"12 oz bottle served lightly chilled in a pint glass. Bottled on December 30, 2003.  Appearance: Slightly hazy dark yellow topped by a healthy offwhite head. Recedes to a healthy layer after a minute or so and left an adequate amount of lacing, but I've seen much much better from IIPA's before.  Smell: Lightly floral and sprucy hops. Whiffs of orange and grapefruit citrus. Not as fragrant or as dense as I've come to expect from an exemplar of this style, though.  Taste: Initial pale malt sweetness, hearty enough to handle the melange of hop flavors that follow. Bitter pine sap followed by mild grapefruit tartness. Not as mind-boggingly great as Dreadnaught.  Mouthfeel: Chewy medium bodied ale with some long-lasting aftertastes. Hop burps aplenty. Quite a palate cleanser.  Drinkability: A textbook, and well-made, IIPA. I'd definitely have more if I had it. However, I kinda think this sucker got overhyped, IMHO. This is not Dreadnaught, and not even DFH 90 minute. Still, it's a damn fine beer. Should Victory make this a regular seasonal, I would probably pick it up.  thanks for francisweisen for the trade.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Crosling,4.6,"This is probably the most overhyped brew I have ever encountered in my young life. Nonetheless, I am extreamly excited to try this right now and see what the big deal is. Bottled on December 30th, 2003. I believe this is the dry hopped version but I could be wrong.  Pours a light peach. Pretty light in color but still quite enchanting. The head is white in color and is initially frothy and well developed but then subdues into a creamy top layer that laces very well.  Very pungent aroma. Smells very juicy and fresh. Grapefruit, spicy alcohol, pine needles and lemon in the nose. This smells delightful.  Pleasantly hoppy (not as hoppy as I would have liked). The hops are very juicy and showcase lots of tangerines, pineapple and grapefruit. This beer is starting to grow on me. Solid malt body but mainly just hops. Vanilla Cake sneaks in. Very resiny, juicy, piney and lingering on the finish. The beer has disappeared.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,RonfromJersey,4.82,"A chill hazy gold-orange body, topped by frothy off white head, which leaves excellent lacing.  The aroma is like breathing through a grapefruit in the middle of a pine forest. Fresh, juicy, moist, assertive without being overpowering/off-putting. They should make those little ""trees"" for your car with this scent. Hell the bottle smells great empty.  The taste is not exactly what you might except. It is not ""two-by-four in the face"", nothing but bitterness. There's a malt base, surrounded on all sides by floral and fruity hops, resiney and juicey. There is actually a semi-sweet note bursting out of all the hoppiness. There is an overall impression of freshness.  The mouthfeel has a wonderful lively and oily texture, smooth and coating, but refreshing, not thick.  There is one major problem with the drinkability...the scarcity of this beer acts as a governator. I certainly want another, but I'll save it for a different session.  Any beer would have difficulty matching the hype of Hop Wallop's release. If this doesn't, it certainly is close.  Next year's release will be eagerly awaited.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,feloniousmonk,4.72,"Just cracked the crown on this eagerly anticipated bottle of ale, bottled 12-11-03, and already the sweet, citric aroma wafts out to please the senses, a promising sign.  Fantastically hazy, thrillingly golden, with a mammoth head, pearly-white, bubbly, fluffy-as-a-cloud, very slowly drifting down in size.  Now to check this aroma out, up close: OW-Weee!! there's pine up there, floral a bit, and fruity aplenty, spruce, herbs, this is primeval stuff, potently herbaceous, brilliantly bristling, beyond ""bitter"". Citrus fruit notes, too, a touch of grapefruit, a faint suggestion of pineapple, peach, but the sharp pine-tar factor looms largest.  Past the lips and onto the tongue, it's surprisingly smooth. Huge hoppiness swims all about the senses, but is, incredibly, never too bitter, and lays on the palate just long enough. I'd call the body medium, and finsh is fruity, tangy, and lastly dry, and of perfect length, for it fades off just as it's time to raise the glass anew. Malt is in excellent supply here, and provides one perfect backdrop, just thick and sweet enough to make the bitter hop bouquet so wonderfully palatable. Hop taste hangs in the mouth happily and long, and the sweetness from the ample malt makes a well-balanced, utterly drinkable, Super IPA.  Sure wish I had me a case of this stuff, or 2 or 3, instead of just a few bottles. Where I don't think it's the most incredible Double IPA (3 Floyds, Rogue, Midnight Sun and more vie for that spot), or most delicious IPA of any kind (Town Hall's Masala Mama is still my sweetie, and Bell's TwoHearted can't be beat, especially on tap), it's really a seducer, with a quality that can surely become addicting. Who knows, maybe someday they'll send it out beyond Pennsylvania and I won't have that problem. As it is, not quite done with it, and I wish I had a few more to keep this hoppy happiness happening.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,tavernjef,4.72,"Very nice looking glass O' beer here, hazen golden yellow color with a slight bronzey tone with a tornado of sediment swirling around within. Solid medium height for its crown, just over a finger high, light yellowish in hue, thick, dense, creamy, fades down slowly like a shadow, leaving an always present very thick skim, well actually I guess I wouldn't call it that, its more like a thin frosting. An impressively wide array of thin curtainy lacing covers the glass.  Aroma has a wonderfully charged hoppyness thats largely floral and fresh with a higher sweetness within thats a bit citrusy of very fresh orange, lemon, grapefruit peels layered over the top. Some tender grasses and hop resin are filled in right to the hilt. Not much located on the malt scale here, all hops on the nose, quite lovely.  Nice hop flavor comes right across the front with sweetish floral tones, kinda herbal and grassy, but definately higher in its sweetness and bitterness, its somewhat fat, not quite, but definately juicy enough and resin filled with slight dulled citrus squeezing off notes of freshness in the corners. Dries out in layers effectively slow with lots of hoppy things attached and there's a favorable biscuity dry maltiness in the backing that begins to stand out more as you get farther in to the glass. Very nice. Pretty decent showing of hops here, was looking for something a bit more juicy and fat but the drying levels are what really kept me attracted to it. Feel is close to full with some nice bitterness thats chalked full of floral sweetness and has some very fine drying qualities all the way through to its finish which lingers long and begs you to keep on drinkin'. That said, this continues to be amazingly smooth to my buds with great hop tones, bitterness included. Stellar drinkability! I clearly need more...yummy stuff!  A mighty fine thanks goes out to francisweizen for the many samples!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,mikeys01,4.08,"Tried the Hop Wallop tonight, courtesy of a recent trade with Francisweizen. Pours out a light shiny copper penny color, capped with a frothy just barely off-white head that dissipates quickly, leaving behind a very clear beer. Aroma is fairly fruity hoppy, but not frighteningly so, and is mixed with a pleasant malty sweetness. Taste is at first a sharp blast of floral and citrusy hops, but quickly develops into a pale malt sweetness with nice caramel notes. The finish comes back big and bitter however, and the bitterness stays with you for the rest of the ride, a much more piney flavor than the initial bite. In my homebrew I'd say this was almost a ""green"" beer, the Hop Wallop dares to go where few beers go before...and succeeds quite well. Mouthfeel is quite full to almost syrupy. Moderately drinkable, a 12 oz bottle is more than enough at one sitting. Alcohol is fairly subdued in character, but noticeable in effect!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ark57,4.02,"It is light copper in color with a flowery hop aroma. It is medium bodied and malty, but the hops are the main attraction. It finishes very bitter with citrus/grapefruit and pine. The lingering aftertaste is almost like blueberry jam. It is very easy drinking despite its hefty alcohol content. Interestingly enough, I thought this was relatively different from the bottle. It is much more piney then citrus in the bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,stewart124,5,"This pours a grand golden color with a thick foamy white head and as you drink this there are absolutly beautiful laces that leave rings the whole way down the glass. The smell is a very aromatic blend of hops and a floral note. The taste is an outstanding mix of citrusy flavors and a bit of pine. The hops out do the malts but it's worth it. My tastebuds were taken for a ride and then crushed into submission. This has a dry bite to it but leaves a very distinct aftertaste of those hops. Extremely drinkable and goes down very well considering it's 8.5%. Simply delicious and thankyou Mr. Horace ""Hop"" Wallop!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Fish113d,4.43,"Upon pouring into a pint glass, it was honey-gold in color with a slight head that dissipates pretty quickly. Upon smelling I noticed some obvious hops, honey, sour grapefruits, and some pine, which I figure came from the hops. Pine, citrus fruit, and hops is what was prominant on the first taste, and was slightly creamy but crisp when chilled at about 45 degress.  I drank this while I was already pretty loaded, so I am not so sure I can be quite accurate about EVERYTHING here but was quite good! I definitely recommend it!!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,GreatPondBrewer,4.2,"Very interesting brew from Victory here and not what I would call a traditional Double IPA even though it is a somewhat non-traditional style. Poured a darker golden color with a plump, frothy white head reminicent almost of shaving cream in texture. You could tell this beer was full of high quality malts by the amount of lace that clung to the side of the glass. The smell had a decidedly spicy nose full of pseudo-belgian like qualitys of orange, mellon and other soft sweet fruits. The hops were certainly there, but they had a more peppery twang to them. The same could be said for the taste. The hops were obvious, but much different in presentation than most Duoble IPAs. Much more pepper sharpness to them. There was the obligatory sticky sweetness of the malts that comes with ever Double, don't get me wrong though I love the sweetness. Its like sipping alcoholic honey. The only realy complaint I had with this beer is the mouthfeel was way to thin for the recipe. It was much too watery, which threw me off. However, this would be the perfect beer for a crisp autumn afternoon. Merci damon.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,longpondbeerman,4.45,"This cherished little bottle travelled from Philly to Rochester and then on to Poughkeepsie, where I set up a special moment for my 100th point, and it did not disappoint. The bright hoppy aroma wafted up with the sparkling cascade while I was pouring, and it settled languidly as the modest white head lay down to sleep over a light amber brew. I breathed deeply and once again, hops, hops, and more hops balanced off with a slight tension of citrus and floral esters. OK, and now for the taste--perhaps a tad thin on the mouthfeel, but nonetheless clearly a hopheads delight! This is the real deal, potent, but not in an angry way; rather this ale makes you know you're taking a hit: with a smile and a wink of the eye. To be savored!

345,14916,jtw5877,4.52,Pours a slightly amber hue with a nice hoppy aroma. Tastes very hoppy with a medium mouthfeel. Very grapefruity sort of hop juice. Alcohol is hidden very well.

345,14916,resirob,3.92,"Bottled on 12/30/03.  Hazy deep orange/amber in color, with some sediment in suspension. The head is healthy and lasting, leaving a fair amount of lace behind.  Aroma can only be described as ""hop, the whole hop, and nothin' but the hop"". Piney, fruity/citrusy notes mix in an intruiging way. Did I mention you can smell the hops?  Taste: Hoppy flavors dominate, with pine resin and citrus making themselves known up front. The citrus is almost pineapple-like. Slight trace of malt floating around in there somewhere, but I think the hops ganged up on it and beat it into submission. Balance is not this beer's strong suit. High bitterness throughout, with a dry finish.  Mouthfeel is smooth and substantial. Very nice.  Drinkability is good, especially if you like hoppy beers. The dry finish helps, too. Alcohol is well masked, so watch out!  Another good offering from Victory.

Aroma was citrusy and spicy, reminding me of SN Celebration. This was more piney than citrusy overwhelmingly. It finished really dry and was all hop, no malt complexity. Mouthfeel was full (from a wallop of hops) to dry.

345,14916,sulldaddy,4.34,"Ah...I just scored this from DeadGuyAle, Thanks man!! I pour this chilled sample into my pint glass and the hop aroma hits me immediately. But back to the appearance first. My bottle says bottled on 12/30/03. The brew pours slightly hazy orange color with some suspended sediment present. A bright white soft head foams up easily. Really good head retention as I always have a thin layer throughout my sampling. The aroma is dominated by hops, floral scents first then I pick up hiints of pine and some sour citrus notes too. The first sip reveals a slightly prickly carbonation and medium body. I get a quick hint of sweetness coming through and then the hops take over. Up front the flavor is a light fruity taste, this switches to a sour grapefruit, and finishes kind of chewy and bitter. This beer is surprisingly drinkable considering how high the IBUs must be. Although I am a ""malty"" I definitely enjoyed this one and can see why so many joined the hunt early on. This brew is very much worth drinking, too bad it is very difficult to find.

345,14916,Bierman9,4.38,"(26NOV05) - Just got a 6-pack of this ($11.99) and had to compare to my original review. Has a ""best before"" date on the bottle of 09NOV06. The bier seems a lot lighter in color than I originally noted last year. It is a light golden/yellow hue, and it is mostly clear, with just an ever-so-slight haze. Head is stark white and fine, yet thin. Lacing was quite nice, though. Nose quite dominated by hops, with strong citrus notes but also a sharp, Saaz-like quality. Super smooth, and a strong medium-plus in the body category. Bready malts lie beneath a solid mountain of hops. Very citrussy yet not like a real west-coaster. Still has that sharp, spicy quality, which leaves a strong bite on the palate. Superb stuff! And the 8.5% abv lays low, so caution is advised! (No rating changes). Prosit!!  overall: 4.4 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4.5  *** ***  (Original: 31JAN04) - I finally got the chance to get ""walloped""! This sucka poured a deep golden/orange color, and was fairly hazy throughout. The hue was actually quite becoming to me. The head was a touch off-white, and fairly creamy. It lasted at about 1/4"" for a bit, then thinned and maintained a fine layer of bubbles topping things off. Lacework around the glass was very nice and sticky. The bier had just been poured and the glass was about a foot away from me, yet a pervasive hop aroma abounded. Upon closer inspection I did detect some malt, yet hops and their ilk were quite dominant. Some hints of orange peel/rind were there as well as lots of grapefruity touches. Wallop has a luscious mouthfeel! Body is easily more than medium, yet not quite full, and it has a creamy/silky texture when passing over the tongue. It almost has the chewiness of a rich stout. Light toasty malt is present at the start, with suggestions of caramel, albeit mild. Soon thereafter your tongue is run through the gauntlet of hop flavors. I love it! Lupulin inundation is a welcome sensation!! Lots of citrus (especially grapefruit) along with piney/resiny notes coat the tongue and throat. The aftertaste of hops is oh-so-long-lasting! I detect little presence of the 8.5% abv, and that can be scary, since this bier is going down SO easily! I'd love to do a side-by-side with Hop and I2PA.... Good stuff! Big-time thanks go to Ron, aka BierReise, who was extremely helpful in sending a couple of bottles of Hop Wallop my way. Vielen Dank, und Prosit!!

345,14916,Bighuge,3.28,"I have edited my ratings slightly as of March 16, 2005. This is not nearly the same beer I consumed last year. And it pales in comparison to the top notch DIPAs around. It's a high octane, one dimensional hop juice with no substantial malt backing. That said, my rating is now a reflection of a midpoint between the 2003 edition and the 2004 edition.  A hazed deep golden appearance with small particles suspended evenly throughout. The head is thin and off-white in color. The lace is patchy. The aroma is minty, fragrant and perfumey but on the flipside, also pungent and raw. I like it a lot. The pure hop bliss hits the palate first and foremost. And it is of hop resin, mint leaves, bay leaves, orange rind, pungent mary jane and smoke. The bitterness is bold and clean, not harsh and intense. The malt beneath has a slight toasted characteristic and biscuity feel. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean and the body is about medium. This is a tremendously drinkable Imperial IPA.

Lots of citrus in the nose with grapefruit, lemon and orange along with flowery hops and a piney aroma in the backround. Medium in body and surprisingly smooth. Starts with a citrus flavor then an explosion of hops hit the tounge. Somehow the malt comes to smooth out the beer just when the bitterness is about to overwhelm. Not balanced by anymeans but it is remarkably smooth for something so highly hopped. Crisp, refreshing, and had me begging for more. At 8.5% and a healthy dose of hops, this was quite drinkable.

It is bitter thoughout. And after ya swallow, ya get more bitterness. The one thing that really got me with this beer is the 1st time I had it, I loved it...so I bought a case. Got home and poured myself one after drinking a porter. Big mistake. This beer, more so than others, really relies on a clean mouth....or at least one that was drinking something similar.

345,14916,TheLongBeachBum,4.23,"Presentation: 12 ounce brown glass bottle, colorful label with the usual Victory flair in design. A diatribe down the left hand side has a very Lagunitas feel about it, it is basically a load of bollocks which is nevertheless fun to read. Listed as 8.5% Alc./Vol. and Bottled on Dec. 11-03.  Appearance: I am surprised to see how clear this beer is; I expected a murkier offering. Orange gold color that has a lively off-white head. Smooth, creamy and cumulus, the head has good staying power and leaves some good wall markings. Nice levels of conditioning with some soft lacing rings during the drink.  Nose: Some flowery hops and a thin acerbic bitterness. Strong acidic qualities come through in the middle, it reminds me of a mix of acidic Orange & Lemon boiled sweets that I used to purchase when a child in the UK. Floral at times, citric and acidic, it lacks the usual aggressive hop character of other Imperial IPAs and replaces them with a more palatable fruity-bouquet like Hop character.  Taste: Lots of oranges and citric acidity in the beginning. A tangerine start rises to reveal a bitter hop character that remains Satsuma in character. Lingering grapefruit and lemon dry bitterness slakes the back of the tongue. The bitterness levels are actually quite low I found.  Mouthfeel: Big and very bold, acidic and citric, juicy and fruity. Its a kicker. Solid feel.  Drinkability: The Drinkability is appealing and very enduring, but the flowery floral citric character is a tad too much for me to be honest after a while. Whilst the acidity and citric aspects are welcomed, the high levels of ""orange"" in this beer are a little off-putting after half a bottle; I would have liked a more rasping hoppiness to kick my ass.  Overall: A very acidic & citric IPA that is incredibly appealing, but a little too flowery at times for me. Thanks to Rotsaruch for delivering this to xlperro whilst on his recent travels, and thanks to xlperro for passing this one on to me, for which I am eternally grateful.

345,14916,jcalabre,3.4,"clear yellow, hoppy, mild musty nose. Defintely need to let this one sit out to open up. This is far more a big APA than an Imperial IPA. Tasting this side by side w/ yulesmith, dreadnaught, 90 minute, ruination, I2IPA & white knuckle, it was the odd one out, style wise. It didn't have the look or flavor of what I'd expect of an imperial IPA, especially when the others did.

The beer was an absolutely beautiful glowing hazy golden honey-orange...a unique hue of orange I haven't observed before. It screams deliciousness.  Smell: Fresh orange and grapefuit citric hoppiness, with some pineapple aromatics...the clarity was amazing! There wasn't much else in the nose that I could detect, though I didn't think anything else was needed.  Taste/mouthfeel. The beer pulls in smooth and nectar-like, quickly opening up with an explosion of hoppy bitterness that exudes the aromatics described in the smell, carried on nice carbonation. Chewing the beer combined with retro-olfaction resulted in the maximal exposure to all of the aromatic hoppy goodness. I couldn't get enough of it! The sweetness was minimal, and the finish was crisp and refreshing. I really loved this one, and wish I had a case of it. Well done Victory!

345,14916,RoyalT,4.47,"Appearance - Light orange in color and very hazy with some visible carbonation. The head came up modestly but what was there looked great and showed good retention.  Smell - The complex hops are led off by the huge pine resin. This aspect of the aroma is extremely strong. Other than Silver City's Whoop Ass IPA I can't think of anything else that I've had with this sharp of a scent.  Taste - Yes, this one is the hop monster. It tastes similar to Jack's Double Dry-Hopped IPA. The pine resin is big as Mt. Ranier and is as strong as I've had to date.  The complex nature of the ale comes out next. The balance achieved by all of these flavors is incredible. The effect is that you have these huge flavors that should kill a horse, yet they all go down smoothly. Too good for words.  Mouthfeel - This shares the exceptional balance and smoothness with its Hop Devil cousin. It is well over medium-bodied.  Drinkability - Too much hops? Never! This ale was exceptional and lived up to the hype.  Comments - Huge thanks to francisweizen for sending me a few of these bad boys.  Update - I first tried this beer in 2004 so thought I'd revisit the review in 2010. The ale has mellowed quite a bit. I don't know if they changed the recipe but its much more mainstream now. This is still a terrific beer but I've had to slightly drop a few of m ratings down a bit.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,scottum,3.42,"Well this one arrived on my doorstep frozen solid. Thawed it out in the old fridgeskie.  Pours out a hazy pale amber with a crazy huge white head. Hops are big. Hops are very big. There is malt balance, but the hops run the show here. Not as good as Stone's badboy IPA, but a solid east coast attempt. Mmmm hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,erica,4.5,"Victory Hop Wallop. I had a bottle of the 1st batch way back when... oh wait that was only a few weeks ago.. but i didnt have much and i forgot too much to review it a few days later. Then yesterday I brought over to my bf's house a case of batch2 and had a whole bottle of that, and later a whole bottle of the 1st one.  So... I remember! :) The 2nd batch 1st- Pretty golden color with a white head, not too big but it was there pretty much the whole time. It smelled like a hop factory inside a florist to me, very strong. I liked it cos of the floral aroma, I mean it wasnt too too hoppy. I am/was not the craziest about super hop beers, but i'm starting to like them and appreciate them more. OK, so the taste was actually a lot like the smell but somehow a bit more mellow, not as extreme, but it was still an extreme hopfest. I couldn't taste the alcohol at all but felt it a little when I was done. I guess I'd say hoppy, but balanced just enough to take the edge off the big bitterness. It was good. Mouthfeel was fine, nice and smooth, and drinkability I think would be very good but I can't take all that hoppiness all night, but in time i could see drinking it all night.  Batch 1 a few hours afterwards, revisited- Same colour, but there was a bigger white head. I had to wait to drink it. Similar aroma but more floral even. Seriously, this beer might've just been brewed in a flower bed. Anyway, the taste was very different, I thought. It was much more mellow. Not in-your-face hops. It was hoppy but I could taste the malts more, and it wasn't very bitter. Again I couldn't taste the alcohol. Same mouthfeel and drinkability apply here.  I liked this one better. But I liked them both, so I guess in general I like Hop Wallop. Very nice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,crookedhalo,4.4,"Pours a glowing, hazy bronze. Thick beige head, leaving good lacing. Ruby red grapefruit, piney, spicy (I mean spicy) hop character. Astringent, almost cat urine smell; it's that spicy. Big on the citrus, even in the taste. If you fear the hop, do not drink this. Seems that Victory's really bent over backwards for this brew. This beer has launched itself into rockstar status. Now everyone raise clenched fist, bang head and scream ""Hop Wallop!"" repeatedly.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ChappyCubsFan,4.72,"Thanks to Pisskynights for sending me this brew (my first Hop Wallop) in the BA holiday beer exchange.  Once again I'm amazed and in awe at the taste of a Victory Brewing product. The pour is thick and creamy with a hop aroma that is enticing. The beer is so smooth and accented with a slight touch of sweetness from the malts. It's a very complex recipe and a different taste altogether from the big bold California IPA's I've been used to, and that makes it hard to detect the hops used in this brew. But I would venture to guess Columbus and Cascade hops are used. This beer was a real treat. Now its only a legend I can share with friends, unless of course they brew more of this and ship it out to California.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,bditty187,4.52,"Since I joined BA Hop Wallop has easily been the most hyped beer. People who had it made those without it envious. The attention this beer has received has been nauseating. Still I needed to try it. Could the masturbatory blather about this beer be true? Could the expectations be met?  Clear peachy-gold hue with a slight tawny highlights, the head was creamy in color and texture, it reached about a finger in height. A pleasantly looking beer, there is less color depth than most great IPAs however. The head retention was admirable, it faded to half its size slowly and the soapy cap hung tough. Spotty, sparse lacing. The bouquet is glorious in its hoppiness, there is good depth and layers and layers of hops. It is grapefruit rinds, lemon flesh, grapefruit flesh, pine needles, wild flowers, and distant dashes of spiciness at the end. The potency is solid. The nose is absolutely lovely but Spilker Ales Hopalleuia has a better hoppy nose in my estimation. There is something very special about the palate, it lacks the raw authority of Town Halls Masala Mama but it has tremendous hoppy depth. The more I sipped the more layers became prevalent, at times it was hot and spicy, at times it was pine needles and sap, at times it was lightly flowery and grapefruity, at times it was harsh rinds of citrus fruit. At times it was all of the above. Behind the hoppiness there is a creaminess and a soft, malleable maltiness. Whatever the malt brings flavor-wise is lost on the tongue, which is a little bit of a shame. The 8.5 abv is masked, completely hidden, a tremendous brewing accomplishment. This is beer is far too big to be this easy to drink! It is medium in body, but Im apathetic about the mouthfeel, the creamy, smooth, low carbonation is terrific but the bulk in the body is a little lacking. The aftertaste is nothing but hops, lots of hops. It is very appetizing, slightly hot, slightly dry, slightly juicy, and slightly acidic. This is a wonderful IPA, it really is, but is it drastically better than the dozens of great IPAs on the market? Probably not. The fact that it is bottled helps its reputation grow, the fact it is a limited edition helps too and the fact that Hop Wallop has origins on the East Coast helps the hyperbole run rampant. I am very grateful to francisweizen for the sample, thank you very much. I loved quaffing it and I wish I had a case in my cellar right now. Highly Recommended just remember this beer is mortal and try to set aside the amazing about of publicity it has received.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ElGuapo,4.5,"As I walked into the Standard Tap, I was very delited to see the selection of local Philly brews. Then I saw Victory IPA. Hmmm, could it be, or is it Hop Devil. All it took was one simple question, and then the three of us each had a pint of Hop Devil's big bro in front of us. It was a dark brew for an IPA with a massive covering of white head. The hop aroma was oozing out and probably filling the entire room.  There are those beer that are hoppy, and then there are those that are intensly hoppy sip after sip. The very last drop was still loaded, and it is awesome that you never really get used to the hops. There is some balance in there, and the alcohol is hidden very well. It is drinkable, and I looked forward to every in the face swig. As it warms, it only gets better. I really hope that Victory will make this again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,ithacabaron,4.25,"Sampled at cellar temperature.  Pours a bright apricot colored body with a fluffy head.  Aroma is very hoppy, and somewhat astringent. Hops are mildly spicy, and have a good dose of pine sap in them (although not pine tar). Although it is resinous in character, it is a clean sap smell, as opposed to the ""dirtier"" smell of, say, a Southern Tier IPA (which is good in it's own right).  Taste was not what I was expecting. The hops here were more floral in character, with a soft approach on the palate. There is not a heavy body or malt character -- in fact, it seemed a bit thin at first -- but then I realized that this was in fact a positive, as too many IIPAs that I had tasted were really more barleywine-like in character.  It was nice to try an IIPA that I could have a few of, if I was really inclined to do so (although I imagine you wouldn't want to try and stand up right afterwards).  Overall, this may be my favorite IIPA that I've tried, although Rogue's I2PA is right there with it. I have a case, will be cellaring at least half, and look forward to the next incarnation of this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,aaronh,4.57,"Pours an orange-amber color topped by a modest white head. Sweet floral aroma with a touch of herbalness atop mild citrus. Taste is sweet and floral up front, with decent pine notes in the mid. It finishes with a fairly pithy grapefruit rind flavor on the finish. Really nice how the honey sweetness plays with the triumverate of bitterness without getting to a puckering state. The lingering grapefruit finish detracts from the overall experience. Mouthfeel is solid. Drinkability is very good. This one does pack a wallop. And it's very nice for the lovers of hops. Hopefully a few more cases will be made next year.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,QXSTER1,4.65,"Not much to add to previous reviews except that this is one extraordinary brew. Big, juicy and thick and packed with flavor. As with other greats it expands the envelope. The explosion of hops is followed by a smooth, rounded fruitness and develops a mouthfeel that is unreal. Had this on-tap and can't imagine it being any better in the bottle. With Hop Wallop's reception I would imagine the Victory boys will be brewing more of the this for the eastern market soon.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,BierReise,4.54,"Pours a clear golden color with a thick white head. Retention is good. Aroma is all hops, piney citrusy and fruity with notes of peaches in heavy syrup. Also has a grassy note in there as well. Malt is there but way underneath the hops. Has a nice full Imperial like body that is slightly syrupy with hop resin. Flavor is sweet and with a lasting bitterness that really lingers with each mouthfull. Again as with the aroma, the flavors are mostly from the hops and are a blend of citrus and pine with an emphasis on peaches in my opinion. Malt is there to give it a some balance and finish is just the right amount of bitterness. Overall a top Imperial IPA which I hope will become a regular at Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,IrishRedRock,4.85,"Being that I was unable to score some of this in bottles (as of yet) and probably won't be able to, I consider myself extremely lucky to have stumbled upon it on draught at the Standard Tap. It was simply listed as ""Victory IPA."" ...  --""Hey is that HopDevil on draught?"" --""No, its their new IPA, comes in around 9%"" --""WOO HOO!!! ahem...3 pints please.""  Ok, if you don't think this is an imperial IPA, then really, what is? Pretty solid alcohol character in the finish, and this thing really is over-the-top in hoppiness. Has a nice deep golden color with a well retaining white head. The nose is filled with overpowering hops and pine. The flavor follows, like chewing on a combination of hops, pine needles, and pinecones. This baby is piney. There's a very slight cherry-like malt sweetness centered around the hoppy start and the hoppy/mild alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and buttery, with some mild carbonation. A hophead's paradise would be filled with an endless supply of kegs of Hop Wallop. Try to get some of this stuff. At this point, I'll be frank: this beer is totally kickass.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Boto,4.89,"Big expectations for this one. I got to the brewery and they had sold out of the cases in less than 24 hours. Fortunately, the taps were still flowing. It made me look had the next day for some in bottles. My wife was calling around and found the distributor in Phoenixville had one case left. MINE! Deep golden color to the beer, with minimal head. The aroma hits you hard: Hops, Hops, Hops. From the bottle, it almost smelled as if I had opened a bag of hops from my homebrew stuff. They have a somewhat piney aroma, along with some citrus notes. The first sip duplicates the nose: Hops, Hops, Hops. They are quite strong, but very well balanced. They have a wonderful flavor. This beer is incredibly drinkable. They have invested some time with the artwork on the cases. Could this batch be a test run for future production? We can only hope.  I e-mailed Victory to tell them how much I enjoyed the beer. Bill alluded to the fact that we will be seeing this again near next Xmas. They need to make a lot this time!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,WVbeergeek,4.88,"There's definitely alot of hype behind this brew, I found myself very fortunate to obtain a case of this beauty after there being somewhat of a shortage in the Pittsburgh beer market. Tasted my first bottle at D's sixpack, then I moved on to seek it out on draft at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse where I learned it wouldn't be tapped until the next day. Now let's take a look at this brew what does it do for me and how does it compare to the other bigger IPAs out there. Appearance: Amber with tiny hop particles spread throughout in a suspension like fashion forms a two finger depth head which lasts for quite some time when it does dwindle beautiful even bands of lacing nice. Aroma: Amazing blend of pine cone scented hops with citrusy grapefruit in nature hop dosage a candy like sweet finish to the nose this is nice I am loving it. Taste: Hops are there and in number they do give a burst of hops, but the great part about this beer is that it doesn't overdo it remains hoppy as all hell but allows different flavors to come and share the stage first off grapefruit sweetness is there with a sugary sensation that is straight up unique and tasty. I feel like I am partial to Victory but this one does live up to the load of hype that came with it, for me this is one of my favorite IPAs available today second to maybe only 3F's Dreadnaught IPA which has shown me the light not to overlook any small micro out there. Mouthfeel: Sticky texture to this medium body hop resin filled glass of ambrosia it's true ""hoppiness is happiness"". Drinkability: Amazingly easy to consume I can't picture this beer being 8.5% abv it just doesn't seem that way to me. Can't wait to get a taste of this one on draft I'm sure it will deliver on every level as well, and then maybe more so.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,beergeek279,4.97,"Served in a nonic pint glass at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse. The color was copper, with an excellent head. The smell was a nice hoppiness. The taste started off with a grapefruit blend of hops (which I have no idea how they got, but was glad they did), with a very nice piney, fruity aftertaste, and the alcohol was unnoticable...I wouldn't have believed this beer was 8.5%! Mouthfeel was just right. Drinkability-wise, I could absolutely have this one one after the other after the other...  What an amazing brew to enjoy for my 300th review. As complex an IPA as I've ever had in my life; hops that certainly delivered a nice bitterness but somehow managed to balance the beer out. This may have surpassed Ruination as my favorite IPA, and is certainly a beer I will have again in the future, hopefully as a non-seasonal!!!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Ianhockey91,5,"Wow! A phenominal ipa, this is one for the ages. Pours out a nice darker golden color with a white head that leaves a beautiful amount of lace, i mean its a work of art in its own right. The smell is overwhelmingly citrusy, wit ha hint of alcohol and very little malt. The taste, ohhh the taste, hops hops and more hops. The malt is light in character and doesnt have too much presence. Its a bit sweet up front and then you ""get walloped"" bith a citrus blast of hops towards the end all followed up with a touch of alcohol.

345,14916,Jarod,4.73,"Thanks to Jaysus for the tip on where to buy this one. Dated 12/11/03  Well what can I say about this beer. It poured a simply beautiful pure spun golden color, 24 karat and was crystal clear, and well carbonated. The head that it produced was an off white, butter cream color that was thick, creamy, rich and sticky ( I know because I stuck my finger in it and it just pulled away a small peak from the beer and left a peak on my finger tip. It lasted fairly well, and then when it finally fell it fell to a small skim on the surface and a healthy ring on the edges. There was really nice lace left behind, at first it was in a thick sheet then started to break off into a nice speckled lace ½ way to the end of the glass. The aroma was dominated by hops. Fresh hops, dried hops, whole hop cones and the leafs of the hops. I also noticed a tad bit of sweet malt as it warmed in the back of the nose. But this one is all hops my friends. The flavors that danced across my tongue were similar to the nose but more complex. First I got a micro second taste of a sweet malt the it was conquered quickly by all the hops, (fresh, whole leafy, you name it), then a nice carbonated bite came across my tongue along with a Christmas tree, some fresh fruit (grape fruit, apple, pear), light but noticeable, then finished with a spicy bite and more hops as it flowed down to the belly. The after taste was more of a piney taste then anything. The abv of 8.5% was not noticeable at all, which was a big surprise to me. The body was on the medium to heavier medium side. It was a bit chewy at times. If one word describes this beer it would be HOPS, or 2 words complex hops. There is allot of things going on with this beer. Granted dominated by hops, but as it raises a few degrees more and more flavors become present. It certainly mellows and becomes smoother as it warms. A real treat to drink again and again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,goindownsouth,4.4,"I am generally not one that buys into hype surrounding a brew, even though this hype was coming from Victoryville, Pennsylvania. This beer was purchased at Tanczos in Northampton on 12/19/03 and it was bottled just 2 days prior. That deserves a ""yo!"" India Pale Ales are, without a doubt my favorite style of brew, given their complexity and depth of aroma and flavor. Enough about me, let's get to this brew. I poured this bad boy out of the 12 oz. ever-so-entertaining bottle and the color was a little more pale then I had expected, but still, a great head and a fantastic looking glass of beer. The aroma is amazing, similar to some of the best IPAs I have ever had, yet so damn different. It is complex and ohhh so hoppy. The hop aroma smacks you in the face immediately, and leaves you asking for more...because you want it. The first sip, slowly taking the glass to your lips to get a good whiff of the brew as you drink, and you are transcended into a time and place that is boardering on otherworldly. The flavor offers notes of pine and citrus (apricot so my wife and I say). This brew just glides back against your palate with solid carbination and mouth feel. I cannot believe how much I enjoyed that first bottle. If you can find it, and that will not be easy, get some. It is well worth it.

345,14916,frank4sail,4.92,"Golden peach crystal clear color with lots of little bubbles in the glass.. Beautiful jewel (it shimmers in the glass) of a beer. Rich thick white head on the pour leaves within 5 minutes (due to abv). But there is a constant white sheen and nice lacing effect on the glass at all times. Fresh grapefruit rind and orange peel nose. Smells like you are in a citrus grove in Florida. The inital smooth sweet malt taste is quickly slammed on the tongue by a huge excuse the expression ""wallop of grapefruit hop juice"". If you were not a hop fan like myself you would freak.. The grapefruit sting then is mellowed in the finish with a touch of lemon and a malty smoothness comforts the abused tongue. Balence in the abuse. Medium to fuller body with a nice smooth lively mouth. Very flowery and floral upfront as well.  This brew lives up to the talk... Victory please don't change a thing, except offer it for wider distribution... It was worth my quite long drive to get it.... A very pretty, flavorful, satisfying brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91

The nose is amazing with a very strong, rich hop character. The head is quite good. It gets thin but leaves a very thick lacing, like a milkshake. The beer is golden in color. I'd love to switch it with somebody's BUD and see what happens. The taste is outstanding. There is a very clean, crisp bite. The taste is rich and has strong grapefruit-like tastes. The alcohol isn't noticeable because the hops cover it up. I haven't had an IPA this good, ever. I hope that they make more of this.

345,14916,nomad,4.53,"from a day-old keg of the very first batch of Hop Wallop:  A very pale orange color, the complete clarity of this beer is impressive. On top it is crowned with a thick frothy head that is compact and goes nowhere for quite some time. Leaves plenty of thick, clumpy stain in rings around the glass, as the lace is thick wide and slow to fall. A treat to peer at.  Smells of big, fine pale-ish malt with fruity and floral scents surrounding, choking it with hoppiness - scents of grapefruit, tangerine peel, and bitter floral accents lurk around every corner. Earthy dry herbs progress further forward and a grainy presence comes through with time. Plenty of fruit and even more florals, in sum.  Tastes of straight hop flavors: grapefruit with attendant husky bitterness, an edible hop leaf presence, and citric spikes and floral chewiness. A small apricot presence pops up here and there, and does much for balancing sweetness despite its size (relative to the abundant hops, that is). Definitely a syrupy sense of hop oil with a little warming up, too. Way in the background you can taste pale malt holding all this up, but it knows its merely supporting role. At times darn close to spicy, I could feel the warmth of alcohol down to my stomach. The moderate mouthfeel is full and coming toward syrupy smooth, thirst enducing as are most Victory beers.  The impressive part is found in the finish, which is only moderately bitter in the far back of the mouth, residing with some length but not nearly as much strength. Needless to say, an immensely drinkable beer. Big on floral and grapefruit hop flavor and relatively low on bitterness, I find this rare for a harvest/hop-focused ale. Much less noxious than many West-Coast hop monsters but with comparable amounts of flavor. IPA, harvest, and blonde ale rolled into one, its not much like anything else I've ever had. Unique.  **Not to be confused with subsequent years of this beer**",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,Edwin,4.65,"After reading the insane hype on this while at work, I called and reserved a case of this brew. Got to the store and they had sold my case. Needless to say I was not happy (Jaysus, you dirty bastard :) ), but I took it with good humor and kindly asked the guy to call another beer store and see if they had it. They did. Good ol' Glen Miller's. I fought rush hour traffic and finally got my hands on this case an hour and a half after setting out to buy it. I have waited for it to cool a bit and now is the moment of Zen...  In the immortal words: ""Momma said knock you out.""  Every sip makes me smile. This is the no-diversion hop explosion I have been waiting for. I am giddy writing this review. I whole-heartedly felt that my $42.00 was going to go completely down the tubes. I could not have been more wrong.  Appearance: More gold than I had thought it would be. A golden delight that completely fools you on the style. A nice, white head with some lacing left over.  Smell: The smell is of hops. Not much else, as I don't think their intent was to include anything else. A great hop smell that is every bit as good as advertised.  Taste: Effin' great. If you like hops and Imperial IPA's, this beer is your bitch. This is the girl that you take to the prom and don't hook up with because you are too afraid to lose her, but she ends up wanting it bad anyway and your night quickly goes from good to great. The taste is of hops, hops, and...um...hops. Some more beer goodness in there, but no fruitiness or other flavors. Perhaps a slight alcohol tinge on the end. An outstanding hop flavor.  Mouthfeel: Mellow, but with a slightly bitter hoppiness that hop-heads will not only love, but savor. A smoothness that you will not believe.  Drinkability: If you are into hoppy beer, you will drink more than 2 of these in a sitting. This brew does not ask nicely, it DEMANDS you drink a few and love it. It goes down easy and the flavor is so nice that you will constantly find yourself having more. Only thing you have to watch is the 8.5% ABV.  In conclusion: DRINK THIS BEER. I am convinced it will solve world hunger, bring peace to the middle east, make models like me, promote me, and make my penis grow. It's pretty darn good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
345,14916,dmarch,4.25,"Ahh, Victory tests the Imperial IPA waters. Just tried it the first day it was available. Very pale in color, almost making you confuse it for a lager. Thick white head. No caramel character whatsoever or any kind of malty sweetness for that matter. I came looking for hops and I definately found hops. Not sure of the hop varieties, but there is a very predominant grapefruit character, perhaps a bit more grapefruit than I'd like, but I really enjoy the in your face hoppiness. Good job Victory.

345,14916,rotsaruch,4.58,"Well, I feel I am one of the fortunate ones to have this unusually facinating brew from the Boys at Victory at premiere debut of Hop Wallop at The Drafting Room in Exton, PA. I had an opportunity to enjoy it both on draft and in the bottle. Old Hop Wallop (Steve German, Victory's Director of Sales), the Sheriff (Matt Guyer), the Deputy (Jack Curtin) and Miss LuLu Belle Lager (a.k.a. Miss Victory) were in attendance. What a group!!  The style of this brew is simply described on the bottle as a very hoppy ale. Believe me it is hoppy happiness!! The appearance is this burnt, setting sun color. There are no carmel malts in this beauty. The head consists of a dense white foam with a pronouce lacing from start to finish. The hops aroma is unmistakable; a noticable fusion of a floral, fruity fragrance. There is this disturbingly delicious hop taste that awakens the palate with a noticeable grapefruit and spicey flavor. What is this combination of hops that have been added at the various stages to provide this unique compliementary flavor? I know there are two of them, but who really cares after enjoying the beautiful sensation of joy. The pale malt provides an excellent, tantilizing hint of sweetness. The mouthful consists of this delicious slippery, smooth velvet feel. If your a ""hophead,"" this is one drinkable brew. The only scary aspect of this brew is you will never know its 8.5% abv until you have the second one. Then, you feel like Old Horace ""Hop"" Wallop and feel that hoppy happiness glow. Hope you all have an opportunity to try this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,91
